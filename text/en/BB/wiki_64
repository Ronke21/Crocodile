<text>Court Line was a 20th-century British tramp shipping company that was founded in 1905. In the 1960s it diversified into shipbuilding and charter aviation. Its merchant shipping interests were based in London. Its shipyards were at Appledore in Devon and Sunderland in Tyne and Wear. Its airline was based at Luton Airport in Bedfordshire. It also provided bus services in Luton and surrounding areas.

Its airline helped pioneer the concept of &quot;cheap and cheerful&quot; package tours to Spain and other destinations in the Mediterranean in conjunction with Clarksons Holidays, thus taking part in the establishment of a whole new way of holidaymaking for the British public.

The Court Line group, including its airline and subsidiary tour operators, Clarksons Travel Group and Horizon Travel, ceased trading on 15 August 1974, with at least £7 million owing to 100,000 holidaymakers.

==Shipping==
Philip Haldinstein was a British Jewish businessman from Norwich. He founded the tramp shipping company Haldinstein and Co Ltd in 1905. Robert Stephenson and Company launched Haldinstein&#x27;s first ship, &quot;Arlington Court&quot;, at Hebburn on the River Tyne that October.
Between 1906 and 1912 Haldinstein added several new steamships from shipyards on the Tyne and the River Wear. When the First World War broke out in 1914, Haldinstein &amp; Co had a fleet of seven ships and was operating as Court Line, Ltd. Anti-German sentiment arose in Britain in the war, so in 1915 Haldinstein shortened his surname to Haldin.

In 1915 Haldin bought a second-hand ship, &quot;Dalebank&quot;, which he renamed &quot;Ilvington Court&quot;. In 1917 a U-boat sank &quot;Ilvington Court&quot; in the Mediterranean, killing eight of her crew. Haldin sold several ships between 1916 and 1921, reducing his fleet to only two ships: &quot;Geddington Court&quot; and &quot;Hannington Court&quot;.

From 1924 onward Haldin expanded his fleet again. He bought a mixture of new and second-hand ships. The second-hand ones were ships that had been built just after the end of the First World War to the Shipping Controller&#x27;s war standard designs. Haldin continued to name his ships in the same &quot;&quot;—ington Court&quot; style, and re-used some names more than once. By 1926 the fleet had 26 ships.

In 1926 Haldin registered his fleet under the name United British Steamship Co Ltd. In 1929 Richard Philipps, the youngest brother of Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant, joined Haldin in the business, which was renamed Haldin and Philipps Ltd. In the 1930s part of the fleet was laid up. In 1939 Haldin was made a Knight Bachelor.
In 1937 Court Line lost two ships. &quot;Nollington Court&quot; sank in the Caribbean after striking a submerged object. Less than a fortnight later, &quot;Quarrington Court&quot; sank in the Red Sea after springing a leak in a water intake in her engine room.

When the Second World War began in 1939, Haldin &amp; Philipps Ltd had a fleet of 23 ships. In the war it lost 14 ships, 13 of them to enemy action, with the loss of 136 lives. One ship, , was lost with all hands.

From 1940 onward Haldin &amp; Philipps started to manage some Empire ships for the Ministry of War Transport. In 1945 and 1946 it bought these ships and renamed them with &quot;—ington Court&quot; names.

In 1948 Philipps retired, and the company name reverted to Haldin &amp; Co. Haldin died in 1953, aged 73.

From 1952 onward Haldin &amp; Co started to buy new ships again. In the 1960s the fleet diversified into tankers. The first was &quot;Edith Borthen&quot;, which Haldin bought in 1963 and renamed &quot;Halcyon Days&quot;. The second was &quot;Halcyon Breeze&quot;, which Hitachi built for Court Line in Japan in 1964. The Admiralty chartered &quot;Halcyon Breeze&quot; as the oiler . All Court Line tankers were named in the same &quot;Halcyon —&quot;&quot; style.

In 1964 Court Line bought Appledore Shipbuilders in Devon. In 1972 it took over a larger shipbuilding business, the Doxford and Sunderland Group. When the Court Line group went bankrupt in 1974, the shipyards and remaining ships in the fleet were sold.

==Aviation==
===Autair===
The airline, originally named Argus Air Transport, was formed at London Luton Airport in 1957. In 1960, it became Autair (Luton). On 27 September 1963, it changed to Autair International Airways.
Autair started as a division of Autair Helicopters, a helicopter operator established in the early 1950s. (Autair&#x27;s helicopter interests were subsequently hived off into a separate company.) It began public transport operations with an ex-British European Airways (BEA) Douglas DC-3, used on contract work for other airlines. More DC-3s and Vickers Vikings were bought. The first of the latter joined the fleet in 1962. Both types operated freight and passenger services, including a growing number of inclusive tour (IT) flights.

One of the earliest charter customers for Autair&#x27;s DC-3s was ex-naval officer Tom Gullick, who would later head Clarksons. Clarksons began its relationship with Autair by contracting the airline&#x27;s Vikings to ferry day-trippers between up to ten UK departure points and Rotterdam during the Dutch bulbfield season. Airspeed Ambassadors and a leased Handley Page Herald were introduced in 1963. The former were the airline&#x27;s first pressurised aircraft while the latter was its first turboprop.

On 1 October 1963, the airline commenced scheduled services between Blackpool and Luton with Vikings. The route was subsequently operated with Ambassadors and extended to Glasgow on 24 May 1966.

In the following years, all piston-engined aircraft types were withdrawn and replaced with Hawker Siddeley 748 and Handley Page Herald turboprops. Three Heralds operated the company&#x27;s scheduled services, including the main London—Teesside route.

1960 saw the formation of Clarksons Tours (later, Clarksons Holidays) with Tom Gullick as managing director. Over the next few years, Clarksons would become Autair&#x27;s and its successor Court Line&#x27;s most important tour operator customer.

In April 1965 Court Line bought Autair&#x27;s entire share capital for £215,000.

Autair became a jet operator in 1968, when three brand-new BAC One-Eleven 400 series joined its fleet. The new jets mainly operated IT flights.

1968 was also the year Clarksons&#x27; customer base had grown to 175,000 (up from 4,000 in 1964), many of whom flew to their holiday destination on Autair&#x27;s new jets.

By spring 1969, five One-Eleven 400s (including an example acquired second-hand from Channel Airways) operated Autair&#x27;s IT flights, primarily under contract to Clarksons Tours. These carried the bulk of the airline&#x27;s half-a-million annual charter passengers, which far outnumbered the 66,000 using its scheduled services each year.

From 1 April 1969, the airline&#x27;s scheduled operation in London was consolidated at Heathrow, joining Teesside services which had already transferred to London&#x27;s premier airport from the company&#x27;s Luton base on 1 November 1967.

In summer 1969, Autair announced its decision to withdraw all scheduled services &quot;irrevocably&quot;, following an unsuccessful request for government subsidies. By that time, the airline&#x27;s scheduled network served Belfast, Blackpool, Carlisle, the Channel Islands, Dundee, Glasgow, Hull, the Isle of Man, London and Teesside in the UK, Dublin in the Republic of Ireland and Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Scheduled services accounted for 12% of Autair&#x27;s turnover. The airline&#x27;s scheduled operation was estimated to have generated an annual loss of £150,000 (only London—Teesside was said to be profitable).

On 31 October 1969, scheduled services were stopped and all turboprop aircraft sold. This was followed by an order for seven of the larger 119-seat 500 series One-Eleven.

===Court Line Aviation===

To coincide with the arrival of the first BAC One-Eleven 500, the airline changed its name on 1 January 1970 to Court Line Aviation and introduced a new corporate look and strategy that focused exclusively on the then fast-growing package holiday market. As the larger One-Eleven 500s were delivered, all but one of the smaller, former Autair 400 series One-Elevens were retired.

The corporate look was an all-over colour design by Peter Murdoch. In keeping with the holiday &quot;feel-good factor&quot;, One-Elevens were painted in the following distinctive, eye-catching pastel colour combinations: yellow/gold/orange, pink/rose/magenta, pale violet/mauve/purple, light green/mid-green/forest green. As with the tankers in the shipping fleet, the aircraft were named &quot;Halcyon Breeze, Halcyon Skies, Halcyon Days&quot;, etcetera. Aircrew wore trendy uniforms designed by Mary Quant. This was part of making passengers feel that the flight was a &quot;fun part&quot; of their holiday. For many, it would be their first flying experience.

Other airlines and tour operators were quick to jump on the burgeoning package holiday bandwagon. This resulted in increasingly fierce competition between operators and led to a price warfare to fill planes and hotels. Under Tom Gullick&#x27;s management, Shipping Industrial Holdings&#x27; subsidiary Clarksons Holidays became the undisputed cut-price leader in the IT market. By 1973, Clarksons carried 1.1 million holidaymakers—almost 1968&#x27;s whole industry total—and contracted over 70% of Court Line&#x27;s charter capacity. Its meteoric rise was entirely volume-based. It generated the required volumes by ruthlessly undercutting rivals and outbidding them to win the race for securing accommodation in popular overseas holiday resorts, especially in Spain. Thus, in the early 1970s, a holiday in Majorca or on the Costa del Sol became affordable for the average person for the first time.

Court Line and Clarksons Holidays were also a UK pioneer of the &quot;time charter&quot; concept, whereby the airline entered into a long-term relationship with the tour operator. &quot;Time charter&quot; was modelled on similar long-term arrangements between ship owners and charterers in the oil tanker business. It resulted in greater economic security for the charter airline industry and enabled it to acquire new aircraft on more favourable terms.

====&quot;Seat-back&quot; catering====
Court Line invented &quot;seat-back&quot; catering, a new concept that permitted a reduction in the amount of galley space inside its aircraft&#x27;s cabins. The extra space obtained was equivalent to three seats on the One-Eleven 400. This enabled it to increase seating densities and reduce individual seat rates to allow tour operators to hold on to their market shares in a price-sensitive environment.

The concept itself consisted of pre-packed meals or snacks – usually, Spam salads out and sandwiches back — loaded into a small, two-shelf compartment in the seat back in front of each passenger. The meal/snack for the outbound journey could be found in the top compartment, the one for the return trip in the lower section. The latter contained a pellet of dry ice placed under the plastic food container, thus preventing the food from spoiling. For the airline&#x27;s cabin staff, it eliminated handling trays while airborne and resulted in a reduction of their workload. To prevent outbound passengers from consuming meals intended for return passengers, locks needed to be installed on the lower compartment that could only be opened by cabin staff during the aircraft&#x27;s turnaround at the destination airport (although these were not always effective at deterring determined passengers).

In addition to Court Line/Clarksons, Great Universal Stores (GUS) subsidiary Global was a major proponent of &quot;seat-back&quot; catering among the UK&#x27;s leading contemporary tour operators. It demanded that package holiday costs be driven down to the bare minimum by replacing the traditional meal service on holiday charter flights with something much cheaper that would simply give passengers &quot;a slice of pie&quot;. Industry insiders referred to Global&#x27;s new inflight catering concept as &quot;Global Pie&quot;. The cost advantage industry leaders such as Court Line/Clarksons and Global gained over their rivals as a result of their onboard catering innovation eventually forced every other major UK charter airline to adopt &quot;seat-back&quot; catering on most flights serving short- and medium-haul IT destinations.

====Widebody era====
In 1973, Court Line took delivery of a pair of Lockheed L-1011 TriStars and became the first European airline to operate the Lockheed widebody. The aircraft were acquired on long-term lease from Airlease International, a consortium of eleven British banks and financial institutions. They were uniquely customised for Court with double-width doors to speed up passenger evacuation and featured integral passenger stairs and baggage conveyors to facilitate operations at smaller airports. The introduction of these brand-new widebodies was a big gamble for a small airline operating in a seasonal market with tight margins as the new jets had four times the One-Eleven&#x27;s passenger capacity (476 vs 119).

Court took the view with Clarksons that the market would grow and that such large aircraft could be operated profitably. In addition, Clarksons was looking to expand further into cruise holidays and new markets in the US and the Caribbean. This, at the time, was wholly new territory for the UK package tour market.

The acquisition of Leeward Islands Air Transport (LIAT), a regional airline based in the Caribbean, in 1972 was part of Court&#x27;s long-haul expansion strategy. Court Line provided LIAT with BAC One-Eleven series 500 aircraft for scheduled passenger services in the Caribbean. The BAC One-Eleven was the only jet aircraft type ever operated by LIAT.

The introduction of the TriStar led to an increase in maintenance personnel and the modification of an existing hangar at the airline&#x27;s Luton base to accommodate the new widebody. It also resulted in the purchase of a former Royal Air Force Blackburn Beverley cargo transporter from the Royal Aircraft Establishment to airlift Rolls-Royce RB211 replacement engines and/or other essential spares in case the planes developed a serious technical fault at an overseas station that prevented them from returning to Luton (although in fact the Beverley was never civil registered and so was never used).

The airline&#x27;s total investment in widebodied equipment amounted to US$55 million.

====Hard times====

As early as 1971, Clarksons lost as much as £2.6 million despite increasing its turnover by £9 million to £31 million. Industry sources estimated that this equated to a loss of £4 per head.

In 1972, Clarksons&#x27;s loss grew to £4.8 million. This was almost 2½ times as much as the combined loss of Thomson Holidays (£1.6 million) and Horizon Holidays (£388,000), its closest rivals.

By 1973, Clarksons carried over a million passengers and accounted for 40% of Court Line&#x27;s turnover.

During the 1973–74 winter season, Clarksons&#x27;s plight worsened. At the time, the UK was in the grip of a recession, as a result of the early 1970s energy crisis caused by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&#x27; oil boycott of the West in the aftermath of the 1973 Arab–Israeli War. This was a punitive measure directed against these countries for their support of Israel during that war. It led to a drastic reduction in the availability of petroleum products – including jet fuel. This in turn resulted in a tripling of the oil price in October 1973 and a subsequent quadrupling.

1974 became known as the worst year for the UK package tour industry. At the beginning of the year, Britain plunged into the three-day working week, as a consequence of the miners&#x27; strike that had been called to topple the Heath Government. This immediately reduced package holiday bookings by 30%. Clarksons, Court Line&#x27;s main customer and in-house tour operator since April 1973, was facing mounting financial pressure, and Vladimir Raitz&#x27;s Horizon Holidays, another of the airline&#x27;s major customers, collapsed during that time. Following Court Line&#x27;s takeover of Clarksons the previous year for a nominal £1 (excluding a £3.4 million &quot;subsidy&quot; from the airline&#x27;s parent company to cover the tour operator&#x27;s projected 1973 loss), it purchased the Horizon group&#x27;s goodwill for £600,000—including the acquisition of 58% of Horizon Midlands for £400,000—from the administrator. The deal, which became effective in February 1974, was based on payment of £1 for each Horizon customer Court Line expected to carry over the following three years. The airline&#x27;s decision to purchase Clarksons as well as Horizon was intended to protect its business. In reality, these deals did little to help improve Court Line&#x27;s increasingly bleak prospects.

As soon as Court Line began diverting Horizon customers onto its planes, British Caledonian (BCal) threatened having Horizon compulsorily wound up if Court Line did not agree to settle Horizon&#x27;s outstanding debts of over £100,000. BCal&#x27;s threat forced Court Line to sub-charter a fully crewed BCal One-Eleven jet for Horizon&#x27;s flying programme and to provide it with additional business. In addition to BCal forcing Court Line to compensate it for the loss of Horizon&#x27;s business, Thomas Cook&#x27;s money-back guarantee – a scheme widely copied by other rival tour operators – further reduced the number of Horizon holidaymakers travelling on Court Line&#x27;s jets. As a result, Court Line carried far fewer Horizon customers than it had anticipated. Clarksons&#x27;s financial position further deteriorated. In a desperate attempt to fill the group&#x27;s planes and hotel rooms so that it could stay afloat, Clarksons continued selling holiday packages below cost, with a fortnight all-inclusive holiday to Majorca selling for as little as £50.

====Bankruptcy====
A deal between the Court Line group and the Wilson Government to sell the former&#x27;s shipyards at Appledore and Sunderland to the latter for £60 million turned out to be &quot;too little too late&quot; to stave off the company&#x27;s impending collapse.

On 15 August 1974, Court Line went bankrupt, with all flights cancelled, its fleet comprising two TriStars and nine One-Eleven 500s grounded, all 1,150 staff losing their jobs and as many as 49,000 holidaymakers stranded overseas with no means of getting home. To enable stranded holidaymakers to return to the UK at no additional cost to them, the collapsed group&#x27;s rivals organised an airlift through the Tour Operators&#x27; Study Group (TOSG), the package holiday industry association. This operation was paid for using the £3.5m bond the failed group&#x27;s tour operators had deposited with TOSG.

The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) set up a fund to provide an insurance against such an event in the future. This was a compulsory bonding scheme for travel companies that transported their customers by air. It was administered by TOSG.

On 16 August 1974, all of the group&#x27;s UK-based subsidiaries went into voluntary liquidation. This included Court Line Aviation and Clarksons Holidays.

Leeward Islands Air Transport (LIAT) in the Caribbean as well as South Africa-based Court Line Helicopters were among Court Line&#x27;s overseas subsidiaries. Both survived the UK parent company&#x27;s collapse. LIAT subsequently withdrew the BAC One-Eleven series 500 aircraft from its fleet which had been provided by Court Line.

The Court Line Coaches subsidiary, although itself solvent and having most of its work from sources other than Court Line Aviation, was wound up shortly afterwards. &quot;Commercial Motor&quot; of 23 August 1974 noted that &quot;&quot;Court Line&#x27;s coach fleet continues operations &#x27;for the present&#x27;. A go ahead to stay in operation has been given to Court Line Coaches Ltd by Mr Rupert Nicholson, who has been appointed to wind up the Court Line holiday giant which collapsed last week. Court Line Coaches has a fleet of 59 coaches and its managing director Mr Ron Keech told CM on Tuesday that the company has been told it could continue trading. He had however, &quot;no idea&quot; what might happen in a few months&#x27; time.&quot;&quot;

====Factors behind collapse====
In addition to the early-&#x27;70s oil crisis and the three-day week, there were other factors that had caused the collapse of the group of companies that included Court Line and Clarksons.

One of these factors was the parent company&#x27;s precariously highly geared investment in the shipping and leisure industry sectors.

According to some insider reports at the time, Court Line Aviation was a viable business. However, a proposed management buyout was rejected as its liquidation value was needed to pay off the parent company&#x27;s debts.

The Department of Trade and Industry final report into the Court Line collapse concludes:

&quot;The short answer is that there was no single reason for the collapse, which was caused by a number of contributory factors. Court Line expanded rapidly in many directions, some of which were both logical and justifiable, others not. The overall management was throughout inadequate and it was in any event never supported by the necessary financial control. This meant that as Court Line expanded, it became progressively vulnerable to any substantial setback in any of its areas of activities. When a serious setback occurred, triggered off by the oil crisis of autumn 1973, it immediately affected the shipping, aviation, and leisure divisions. The group was so highly geared, so structured and having such inadequate financial control, that it might well have been brought down by a substantial reverse in any of its major activities. As it was the cumulative effect on all three divisions, when all the cash resources which would otherwise have been available had been invested unprofitably in the Caribbean, meant that the position progressively deteriorated and rendered the collapse in August 1974 unavoidable.&quot;

====Disposal of airline&#x27;s assets====

Following the spectacular crash of Court Line and Clarksons at the height of the 1974 holiday season, the failed carrier&#x27;s fairly new aircraft were acquired by other airlines. Cathay Pacific took the two L-1011 TriStar widebodies while Dan-Air and Monarch Airlines respectively purchased four and two of the One-Eleven 500 narrowbodies. These aircraft needed to be re-registered to avoid having them impounded by overseas airport authorities in lieu of the airport user charges Court Line owed them.

==Accidents and incidents==
Autair suffered two accidents, one of which involved the loss of lives.

* The first of these occurred on 14 September 1967. One of the airline&#x27;s Ambassadors (registration: G-ALZS) overran the runway at Luton Airport at the end of a non-scheduled passenger flight from Luxembourg. The aircraft had approached Luton in darkness. Visibility was and the cloud base . Following touchdown, the pilot in command retracted the aircraft&#x27;s flaps in the takeoff position and applied brakes intermittently. The aircraft overran the runway and came to a stop in soft clay. This caused the undercarriage to collapse. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and had to be written off. However, there were no fatalities among the 69 occupants (four crew and 65 passengers).
* The second took place on 23 December 1967. A Hawker Siddeley HS 125 (registration: G-AVGW, owned by The Beecham Group and operated by Autair International) crashed shortly after taking off from Luton Airport, killing both pilots. The aircraft had been on a training flight and the crash occurred when the crew simulated an engine failure on takeoff. The HS 125 lost height rapidly and hit the roof of a nearby factory, resulting in a post-crash fire.
* On 18 April 1974, BAC One-Eleven G-AXMJ was involved in a ground collision with Piper PA-23 Aztec G-AYDE during take-off from Luton Airport, Bedfordshire. The Aztec had entered the active runway without permission. The pilot of the Aztec was killed and his passenger was injured. The One-Eleven aborted its take-off and an emergency evacuation was performed with all 93 people on board escaping uninjured. The Aztec was written off and the substantially damaged One-Eleven was repaired and returned to service.
* A Court Line BAC One-Eleven leased to Cyprus Airways was stranded in 1974 at Nicosia Airport following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. It was retrieved by British Airways engineers in 1977, but was immediately impounded on its arrival in Britain by Court Line&#x27;s insurers to help pay off the debts the now defunct company owed. The aircraft was returned to Cyprus Airways in 1978 and remained in service until 1985.

<doc id="235467" wikidata="Q692686" url="?curid=235467" title="List of dukes of Milan">
<text>Milan was ruled by dukes from the 13th century to 1814, after which it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia by the Congress of Vienna.

== List of dukes of Milan ==
===House of Visconti===

In 1395, Gian Galeazzo Visconti was titled Duke of Milan by King Wenceslaus, who sold the title under the payment of circa 100,000 florins. Since that moment, all the following rulers of Milan were styled as dukes.

===House of Sforza (1st rule)===

After the death of Filippo Maria in 1447, the main line of Visconti went extinct. Benefited by political chaos, a cabal of wealthy citizens, academics and clerics declared the Duchy dissolved and proclaimed the oligarchical Golden Ambrosian Republic.
The republic was never recognized and the neighboring states of Venice and Savoy tried to expand their fiefdoms in Lombardy, as well as France. Taking advantage of the state&#x27;s weakness and the resurgent Guelph-Ghibelline conflict, the commander-in-chief of the Milanese forces, Francesco I Sforza, defected from Milan to Venice in 1448, and two years later, after several side switches and cunning strategies, Sforza entered the city during Annunciation. He was then declared the new Duke of Milan by the City Council, using as a claim his marriage with Bianca Maria Visconti, illegitimate daughter of Filippo Maria.

===House of Valois (1st rule)===

In 1494, Ludovico Sforza usurped the throne of Milan, after probably poisoning his nephew Gian Galeazzo. After the threats of the Venetians, Ludovico solicited French king Charles VIII to descend into Italy, starting the First Italian War. After Ludovico&#x27;s betrayal and alliance with the League of Venice in 1495, the French were defeated in the Battle of Fornovo and were unable to expand in Italy. Charles VIII&#x27;s top general and cousin, Louis II, Duke of Orléans (future Louis XII), was humiliated and due to his personal hate toward Ludovico Sforza, started to claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, quoting his paternal descendance from Valentina Visconti and Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s last will. After Louis XII&#x27;s ascension to the French Throne in 1499, he started the Second Italian War to conquer Milan and Naples. With French armies near Pavia, Ludovico and his loyalists left Milan on 17 September 1499 to flee toward Germany. This left Louis XII as the only Duke of Milan, entering the city on 6 October 1499.

===House of Sforza (2nd rule)===
Ludovico Sforza was captured on February 1500, dying in prison in 1508. His son Massimiliano became the Sforza claimant to the Milanese Throne, which he finally re-gained in January 1513, six months after the Swiss army&#x27;s entrance in Milan.

===House of Valois (2nd rule)===
After their defeat in the Battle of Marignano in 1515, the Swiss retired from Milan and Massimiliano was imprisoned by the returning French troops. He waived his rights to Milan for the sum of 30,000 ducats and continued to live in France.

===House of Sforza (3rd rule)===
By November 1521, the French situation had deteriorated considerably. Emperor Charles V, Henry VIII of England, and Pope Leo X signed an alliance against Francis on 28 November. Odet de Foix, Viscount of Lautrec, the French governor of Milan, was tasked with resisting the Imperial and Papal forces; he was outmatched by Prospero Colonna, however, and by late November had been forced out of Milan and had retreated to a ring of towns around the Adda River. For the third time and last time, the Sforza were restored to power.

===House of Habsburg===

In 1535, after the death of the heirless Francesco II Sforza, Emperor Charles V annexed the Duchy as a vacant imperial state in order to avoid other claims by the French or the collateral branches of Sforza.

===House of Habsburg-Spain===

In 1540, the Duchy was secretly given as a gift to Charles V&#x27;s son Philip, Prince of Asturias. This was made official at the abdication of Charles V in 1555. In 1556, Philip became Philip II of Spain and Milan entered in personal union with the Spanish Crown.
===House of Bourbon-Anjou===

In September 1700, Charles became ill; by 28 September he was no longer able to eat and Portocarrero persuaded him to alter his Will in favour of Louis XIV&#x27;s grandson, Philip of Anjou. When Charles died on 1 November 1700, the throne was offered to Philip, who was proclaimed King of Spain on 16 November 1700. This was accepted by Britain and the Dutch Republic, among others. Disputes over division of territories and commercial rights led to the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701.

===House of Habsburg-Austria (then Habsburg-Lorraine)===

After the Treaty of Rastatt of 1714, Emperor Charles VI officially gained the Duchy of Milan, a possession considered vital to the security of Austria&#x27;s southern border. Since that moment, Milan was a permanent possession of the Austrian branch of the Habsburg dynasty.

<text>Elizabeth Berkley ( ) is an American actress and producer. She played Jessie Spano in the &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; television franchise and Nomi Malone in the controversial 1995 Paul Verhoeven film &quot;Showgirls&quot;. She had supporting roles in the box office hits &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; and Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, as well as in Woody Allen&#x27;s period comedy &quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot; and Dylan Kidd&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Roger Dodger&quot;.

On television, she played Julia Winston in &quot;&quot; (2008–2009), Kelly Wentworth in &quot;The L Word&quot; (2009), Shannon Titus in &quot;Titus&quot; (2001–2002) and in 2020 she reprised the role of Jessie Spano in the &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; reboot on Peacock, for which she also served as a producer. In theatre, she appeared opposite Eddie Izzard in Peter Hall&#x27;s West End production of &quot;Lenny&quot; and also in the successful Broadway comedic play &quot;Sly Fox&quot; and the acclaimed Off-Broadway production of &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;, for which she received critical acclaim. She also hosted &quot;Bravo&quot;&#x27;s talent show &quot;Step It Up and Dance&quot; and in 2011 she published the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller &quot;Ask-Elizabeth&quot;, a self-help book for adolescent girls, which drew from the workshops she conducted for her &quot;Ask-Elizabeth&quot; program.

For &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; she earned four &quot;Young Artist Award&quot; nominations and in 1996 she received a &quot;National Board of Review&quot; award for the ensemble acting in &quot;First Wives Club&quot;. In 2011, Candie&#x27;s Foundation honoured her with a prize for her work raising awareness about the risks and hardships associated with teen pregnancy.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Berkley was born in Farmington Hills, Michigan to Jere and Fred Berkley. Her mother was a gift-basket business owner and her father was a lawyer. She has an older brother, Jason. Her family is Jewish and she was raised in a Conservative Jewish household, celebrating her bat mitzvah at Beth Abraham Hillel Moses in West Bloomfield. She was born with partial heterochromia iridium, a condition of differently colored irises; her right eye is half green and half brown and her left eye is green.

At age four, Berkley began taking jazz and tap lessons with Barbara Fink of Miss Barbara&#x27;s Dance Center in Detroit and later took ballet classes with the professional company Dance Detroit. She would also practice at home in a room her parents set up for her in the basement. She danced &quot;Swan Lake&quot; with principals from the American Ballet Theatre and for five years she performed in the New York City Ballet holiday production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; in Detroit. Her dance recital song-and-tap number &quot;Hey Look Me Over&quot; eventually convinced her she wanted to be an actress.

==Career==

=== Theatre and early film and TV roles ===
While attending Cranbook Kingsbrook in Bloomfield Hills, she enrolled in acting and singing classes, making her theatrical debut as Snoopy in a Cranbrook Theatre production of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;. She continued her training with the Detroit-based company Actors Alliance and starred in two plays, &quot;Twain by the Tale&quot; and &quot;Raft of the Medusa&quot;. Professional stage roles soon followed in regional theatre, earning her an Actors Equity card when she was still in middle school. She played Baby June in the musical &quot;Gypsy&quot; (Village Players, Birmingham) and Echo in Lee Blessing&#x27;s &quot;Eleemosynary&quot; at the Ann Arbor Repertory theatre. In 1980 she auditioned for the film version of &quot;Annie&quot; but was turned down because she was too tall.

She also ventured into modeling, initially doing print work for Hudson&#x27;s and other regional outlets and later appearing in TV commercials for department stores in Atlanta, Milwaukee and Canada. She would use her modeling income to commute to Los Angeles and New York to train with professionals, including dancer and choreographer Joe Tremaine, vocal coach Seth Riggs and Broadway Dance Center&#x27;s Frank Hatchett.

After writing a personal letter to TV producer Norman Lear asking him to make her a star, she received a reply from Lear&#x27;s assistant, who encouraged her to reach out whenever she was in Los Angeles. Three years later, during a family vacation in California, she contacted his office and Lear helped her setting up with talent agent Judy Savage, of The Savage Agency. That led to her television debut in one episode of &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; and her film debut in the critically acclaimed short film &quot;Platinum Blonde&quot;, both filmed in 1986. Berkley commuted to Los Angeles on every school break and summer vacation, taking acting classes with Diana Hill and Nora Eckstein of the recently enstablished Young Actors Space and landing roles in &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; and the WonderWorks TV film &quot;Frog&quot;.

Still a teenager, she joined the New Faces division of Elite Model Management in New York (alongside other up-and-coming models like Cameron Diaz) after placing as a finalist in their &quot;Look of the Year&quot; contest. In the fall of 1988, her family eventually relocated to Los Angeles when she was still attending North Farmington High School. She signed with Elite&#x27;s LA division, appeared in YM magazine&#x27;s November issue as a finalist in the &quot;Cover Girl&quot; contest and guest starred in episodes of &quot;Day by Day&quot; and &quot;TV 101&quot;.

=== &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; and TV fame (1989–1994) ===

After losing the leading role of Rennie in &quot;Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;, she auditioned for a regular role in the NBC Saturday-morning sit-com &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;. During the final callback, the producers of the show could not decide whether to cast Tiffani-Amber Thiessen or her for the part of Kelly Kapowski. In the end, Thiessen landed the role but Berkley&#x27;s audition was so impressive that she was ultimately given another leading character, Jessie Spano, a civil-minded student with strong feminist views. The show debuted in August 1989 and aired on prime-time for three weeks, before relocating to its designated timeslot on Saturday morning. It quickly turned into a fan-favorite among young audiences, and its six teenage leads became television stars, appearing in teen magazines and on mall tours all around the country.

During the show&#x27;s breaks over the years, Berkley landed guest starring roles in other popular shows like &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, &quot;Married People&quot; and &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;. In 1991 she even appeared in Kathryn Bigelow&#x27;s &quot;Point Break&quot; but her small role as a surf shop countergirl was later cut. Soon after graduating from Calabasas High School, she began training with acting coach Roy London and left &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; ahead of time during its fourth and final season, along with co-star Tiffani Amber Thiessen, to focus mainly on feature films. The transition from small to big screen turned out to be a difficult one, though, and Berkley worked mainly for television for the following two years, landing roles in &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Step by Step&quot;, &quot;Raven&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;Crossroads&quot;. She also starred in the straight-to-video film &quot;Molly &amp; Gina&quot; and in the TV movies &quot;Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style&quot; and &quot;Bandit Goes Country&quot;. In January 1993 she was featured in the Crystal Pepsi commercial that debuted during the Super Bowl XXVII. During this time, she enrolled at UCLA to study English Literature.

=== &quot;Showgirls&quot;’s backlash and the beginning of film career (1995) ===

In the spring of 1994, Carolco Pictures opened the casting for the leads in Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s new film &quot;Showgirls&quot;, the script of which Berkley had retrieved months earlier while the movie was still in development. Feeling a strong connection to the main character, she conducted thorough research, visiting strip clubs in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York, and interviewing strippers at venues such as Stringfellow&#x27;s, Palomino and Scores. Despite resistance from her agent at Metropolitan Talent Agency, Berkley personally called &quot;Showgirls&quot; producer Charles Evans, introducing herself as Nomi. At her first audition with Paul Verhoeven she told him he might as well stop looking for other actresses because there was no one else who could play that role.
During the extensive casting process, which saw many A-listers auditioning, Berkley briefly reprised the role of Jessie Spano in &quot;Saved by the Bell – Wedding in Las Vegas&quot; before heading to Idaho to film the Disney Channel adventure movie &quot;White Wolves II: Legend of the Wild&quot;. While on location at Yellowstone National Park, she received the call that she had booked the lead in &quot;Showgirls&quot;. Verhoeven later remarked: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have any more hesitation when we met again Elizabeth Berkley.”

Once the casting announcement was official, Berkley signed with Creative Artists Agency and began an intensive 12-week rehearsal period with choreographer Marguerite Derricks and the dance ensemble hired for the film. During this preparation phase, she ran into Demi Moore at one of the clubs in Los Angeles, where Moore was conducting research for her role in &quot;Striptease&quot;. Shooting for &quot;Showgirls&quot; commenced in Nevada in October 1994 and lasted four and a half months, concluding in March 1995. During this time, Berkley reportedly often danced for up to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, never requiring a body double.

In May 1995, Berkley and Paul Verhoeven attended the Cannes Film Festival to present an 8-minute preview of the film. &quot;I was introduced at Cannes to the world as a movie actress and that was something that was very special,&quot; she recalled. The movie was given a previously agreed-upon NC-17 rating in the United States (the first big-budget film to do so) and was released to 1,388 theaters in North America on September 22, 1995. Despite the massive marketing campaign, &quot;Showgirls&quot; was a box office bomb during its original, theatrical run and it was widely panned by critics, garnering a level of controversy and hostile criticism rarely seen in recent cinema. Berkley&#x27;s performance was particularly targeted: Todd McCarthy described it in &quot;Variety&quot; as &quot;harsh, graceless and quickly tiresome&quot;, and Barbara Shulgasser of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, after comparing her to a Barbie doll, added: &quot;That Berkley cannot act is indisputable&quot;. Only a few critics appreciated Berkley&#x27;s work: Roger Ebert in &quot;The Chicago Sun Times&quot; wrote that her &quot;fierce energy [was] always interesting&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; remarked that &quot;the electricity of her anger&quot; made her &quot;a true, leonine presence&quot;.

The storm of criticism that followed quickly turned into personal vilification, with reviewers going so far as labelling her a &quot;meat puppet on a stick&quot; or, as critic Gene Siskel stated on national television, &quot;not sexy, not particularly appealing and not attractive&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Berkley displayed &quot;the open-mouthed, vacant-eyed look of an inflatable party doll.&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; opined that she was &quot;quite convincing when asked to play a girl who is not too bright&quot;. Berkley was later awarded two Razzie Awards as &quot;Worst Actress of the Year&quot; and &quot;Worst New Star&quot;. A journalist whose name Berkley never revealed, began his interview asking her: “How does it feel to be a failure?”

Reflecting on the &quot;Showgirls&quot; backlash, the actress later commented: &quot;There was so much cruelty around it. I was bullied. And I didn&#x27;t understand why I was being blamed. The job as an actor is to fulfill the vision of the director. And I did everything I was supposed to do. No one associated with the film spoke up on my behalf to protect me. I was left out in the cold and I was a pariah in the industry I had worked so hard for.&quot; Verhoeven often took responsibilities for the way Berkley&#x27;s performance was perceived and criticized. Soon after the release of the film, he stated: &quot;Certainly I am partly, or in large degree, responsible. I asked her to do it that way.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2015, he again made it explicit that he felt as if he was to blame for Berkley&#x27;s performance: &quot;People have, of course, criticized her for being over-the-top in her performance. Most of that comes from me. I pushed it in that direction. Good or not good, I was the one who asked her to exaggerate everything — every move — because that was the element of style that I thought would work for the movie.&quot; Film producer Scott Rudin publicly defended her, declaring: &quot;I was impressed with her and her professional attitude about her job. I think what she&#x27;s been through must be about as hard as I can imagine anything being for an actress&quot;. In the wake of the film&#x27;s negative fallout, Berkley made a reportedly &quot;tempestuous&quot; exit from Creative Artists Agency, and spent the following week meeting with ICM, William Morris Agency and United Talent Agency, ultimately signing with the latter. Willing to rehabilitate her image, she embarked alone on an international promotional across major territories, including Spain, Italy, Germany, Australia, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

=== Resurgence, independent cinema and London&#x27;s West End (1996–1999)===
After the controversial release of &quot;Showgirls&quot;, Berkley was met with total resistance from most filmmakers and casting directors, many of whom wouldn&#x27;t even agree to meet with her. Only a handful of prominent directors stepped up, expressing interest in testing her for leading roles in their upcoming films. Among them were Milos Forman (for &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;), Oliver Stone (for &quot;U-Turn&quot;), Luc Besson (for &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;) and Michael Bay (for &quot;Armageddon&quot;). &quot;It was inspiring, actually comforting to have them trust me and support me and embrace my work,&quot; she shared.
In her quest to find a follow-up project, the actress returned to acting classes with coach Howard Fine, starting again from level 1. She also trained under Uta Hagen.

In December 1995, Sherry Lansing, chairwoman at Paramount Pictures, asked Berkley to test for a supporting role in &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, a comedy starring Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, and Bette Midler. After several auditions, the actress eventually booked the part, the first one after the &quot;Showgirls&quot; backlash. &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; was released in September 1996 and was a surprise hit, grossing over $100m at the box office. Berkley&#x27;s small role as naive actress Phoebe LaVelle earned her positive reviews and the entire cast won the National Board of Review for &quot;Best Ensemble Performance&quot;. A more substantial supporting role followed in Tom DiCillo&#x27;s independent film &quot;The Real Blonde&quot;. Although DiCillo initially wanted her for the lead role of Sahara, the supermodel airhead eventually played by Bridgette Wilson, Berkley expressed her desire to play the smaller yet more intriguing part of Tina, a dark-haired Madonna body-double. The movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival before getting a limited theatrical release on February 27, 1998.

She briefly returned to television when she starred in the HBO thriller &quot;Random Encounter&quot; and in one episode of the anthology series &quot;Perversions of Science&quot;. She was also tapped as a regular cast member for the unaired ABC pilot &quot;L.A. Med&quot; and voiced the title character in the animated sci-fi film &quot;Armitage III – Polymatrix&quot;. For her supporting role as a Russian girl living in Brighton Beach in Avi Nesher&#x27;s independent drama Taxman, she studied with a dialogue coach at Berlitz for two months. Reviews were favorable: &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; appreciated the &quot;nicely understated Elizabeth Berkley, sporting a credible Russian accent&quot; and &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; acknowledged, &quot;Berkley, who is called on to deliver lines in Russian, seems to be out to prove that she really can act. She can&quot;. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;the beautiful Berkley added a few moments of relief&quot; and &quot;Box Office&quot; admired the &quot;convincing, well-chosen cast&quot;. Berkley then starred in the psychological drama &quot;Last Call&quot;, by Chilean director Christine Lucas and in Malcolm Ingram&#x27;s road movie &quot;Tail Lights Fade&quot;, but neither film was able to find theatrical distribution in the U.S.

In the fall of 1998, she landed a role in Oliver Stone&#x27;s football drama &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; as Mandy, Al Pacino&#x27;s high-priced call girl. The movie received mixed reviews but it was a financial success, earning $100 million worldwide. In May 1999, Sir Peter Hall cast her as Lenny Bruce&#x27;s wife in his London West End production of &quot;Lenny&quot;, starring Eddie Izzard. The play debuted at Queen&#x27;s Theatre in July 1999 and had a limited 12-weeks run, due to Izzard&#x27;s previous commitments. Berkley&#x27;s portrayal of Honey Harlow (renamed Rusty Blaine in the play) impressed the critics. &quot;The Times&quot; dubbed her performance &quot;a convincingly vulnerable portrayal&quot; and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; described Rusty as a &quot;dejected stripper whom Elizabeth Berkley endows with lovely erotic languor and a true dancing talent.&quot; According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, co-stars &quot;David Ryall, Elizabeth Berkley and James Hayes lend good support&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; described Berkley&#x27;s performance as &quot;impressive.&quot;

===Critical affirmation and Broadway (2000–2007)===
After a recurring role in the seventh season of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and a co-starring part in the E! original comedy &quot;Becoming Dick&quot;, Berkley booked a supporting role in Woody Allen&#x27;s period-comedy &quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot;, which debuted at the Venice Film Festival in 2001.&lt;br&gt;That same year it was announced that she would take on the role of Roxie Hart in the Broadway musical &quot;Chicago&quot; but it ultimately didn&#x27;t happen for undisclosed reasons. She managed to exhibit her musical talents anyway, by taking part in the 2001 &quot;Divas Simply Singing&quot; annual benefit concert at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles, where she sang a rendition of the song &quot;Fever&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;After playing Shannon Titus in three episodes of the sitcom &quot;Titus&quot;, she co-starred in the independent black comedy &quot;Roger Dodger&quot;, opposite Campbell Scott and a debuting Jesse Eisenberg. The movie won the inaugual Tribeca Film Festival and the Best First Film prize at the Venice Film Festival, before opening in selected theatres to rave reviews. Berkley&#x27;s performance was unanimously praised. Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: “Berkley registers here with an affecting, natural performance. She is the big revelation. See for yourself: She&#x27;s very, very good.” Both &quot;USA Today&quot; and Richard Roeper of &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; called her performance “terrific”, the &quot;New York Times&quot; appreciated her “sharp supporting turn”, &quot;US magazine&quot; applauded her “pitch perfect supporting turn”, &quot;Time Out New York&quot; described her performance as “lively and nuanced” and for the &quot;NY Post&quot; she was “excellent”.&lt;br&gt;Other well-reviewed roles came afterwards in the Lifetime original drama &quot;Student Seduction&quot; and the Canadian dramedy &quot;Moving Malcolm&quot;, which got a Special Mention from the First Film Jury at the Montreal World Film Festival. In October 2004, she landed a role in her first Broadway show, the comedy &quot;Sly Fox&quot;. Directed by Arthur Penn and starring Richard Dreyfuss and Eric Stoltz, the production opened in Broadway in April 2004, after an out-of-town tryout at the Shubert Theatre in Boston and 22 previews at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in New York.&lt;br&gt;The following year, she replaced Catherine Kellner as Bonnie in the 2005 off-Broadway production of David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;, appearing with Ethan Hawke, Parker Posey, and Bobby Cannavale. Berkley had three days to learn the part and received praise for her performance, with Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; even going as far as publicly apologizing to her for his past criticisms of her ability, stating that the fact she held &quot;her own among this skilled company of scene-stealers is a testament to how much her talent has grown.&quot;
Between 2004 and 2007, she lined up some high-profile guest starring roles in the shows &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, &quot;Threshold&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; and played a black widow in the TV movie &quot;Dark Beauty&quot;.

In 2005 and in 2006, she appeared in the annual &quot;24 Hour Plays in Broadway&quot;, in which six writers, six directors and 24 actors have 24 hours to write, direct, and perform six 10-minute plays.
Both her comedic stints impressed the critics: among them, Jason Zinoman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; (“an appealingly daffy Elizabeth Berkley Lauren” in an “excellent all-star cast”),
Roger Friedman of Fox News (“she held her own live on stage with Tony-winner Cady Huffman, Andrew McCarthy and Cheyenne Jackson. She&#x27;s ready for SNL!”), the &quot;NY Daily News&quot; (“Berkley did a Meryl Streep-worthy Spanish accent in the hilarious Toccata and Fugue”) and &quot;Theatre Mania&quot; (“Among the evening&#x27;s top acting efforts, a ridiculously Spanish-accented Elizabeth Berkley”).

In 2006, she also starred in Douglas Carter Beane&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;The Cartells: A Prime-Time Soap Opera, Live&quot; at Comix, opposite Joanna Gleason, Brian d’Arcy James, Pedro Pascal and David Rakoff.

===Prime time success and hiatus (2008–2019)===
In 2008, Berkley signed on to appear in a multi-episode arc in the of &quot;CSI: Miami&quot;, portraying Julia Winston, Horatio Caine&#x27;s ex-lover and mother of his teenage son. All the episodes featuring Berkley ranked in the top 10 of the Nielsen ratings chart and Berkley&#x27;s role ended appearing in four episodes, including the season finale, before being confirmed for the following season. Commenting on the high ratings during Berkley&#x27;s appearances, &quot;TV Guide&quot; noted: &quot;&quot;CSI: Miami&quot;, it should be reminded, returned to boffo ratings these past two weeks, and in this past Tuesday&#x27;s special airing gave CBS its best numbers in that 10 o&#x27;clock slot in some five years. Do not underestimate the power of the Jessie Spano fan.”

Due to the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike, which halted all scripted productions (including &quot;CSI: Miami&quot;), Berkley took on hosting duties for Bravo&#x27;s reality series &quot;Step It Up and Dance&quot;, a competition featuring ten aspiring dancers competing for a cash prize of $100,000 and the opportunity to work with and perform for some of the country&#x27;s top choreographers. The show, shot in late 2007 in Los Angeles, premiered in April 2008 and came out as Bravo&#x27;s strongest ever in its time slot (10/11 C) with 826,000 viewers. The show continued to perform well throughout its run, averaging 756,000 viewers each week (of whom 522,000 were aged 18 to 49) and contributed to Bravo&#x27;s highest-rated April ever.

During the hiatus of &quot;CSI: Miami&quot;, Berkley starred alongside David Arquette and Thomas Jane in Arquette&#x27;s 3D short film &quot;The Butler&#x27;s in Love&quot;, which premiered at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles in June 2008 and opened the sixth annual HollyShorts Film Festival.
She also made a cameo appearance in the independent comedy &quot;Women in Trouble&quot; and starred in the direct-to-video film &quot;S. Darko&quot; (the sequel to the cult hit &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;), where she played Trudy, a born-again Christian woman who becomes infatuated with her pastor.
Following her successful nine-episode stint on &quot;CSI: Miami&quot;, Berkley starred in a multi-episode arc on the Showtime series &quot;The L Word&quot; during its sixth and final season. She played Kelly Wentworth, a straight woman who had a romantic relationship with Jennifer Beals&#x27; character Bette Porter, during college.

In August 2009, her appearance on the cover of &quot;People magazine&quot; alongside Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Mario Lopez, Lark Voorhies and Tiffani Thiessen, marked the first &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; official reunion after the show&#x27;s conclusion in 1994.
In 2011, shortly after completing her national tour to promote her first book &quot;Ask-Elizabeth&quot;,
Berkley played the lead role in the Hallmark Channel original film &quot;Lucky Christmas&quot;, about a struggling mother who wins the lottery but must recover her ticket from the glove compartment of her stolen car. The film premiered on November 12, 2011, and opened Hallmarks’ &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot; for that year. Recognizing the material&#x27;s wholesome nature, &quot;The New York Times&quot; nonetheless stated: “Besides the irrational plotting, Ms. Berkley and Mr. Gray-Stanford turn out to be a surprisingly believable, appealing couple-in-the-making.” The television movie marked Berkley&#x27;s last project before taking a hiatus from full-time acting, as she announced her pregnancy in early 2012. Berkley and her husband, Greg Lauren, welcomed their first child, a boy, in July 2012.
In September 2013, Berkley accepted an offer to participate as a contestant in the 17th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, where she partnered with Valentin Chmerkovskiy. Despite receiving several perfect scores from the judges, the couple was eliminated in the 9th week of competition, finishing in 6th place.&lt;br&gt;

During this period, Berkley still lined up a few comedic roles in episodic television: she played a rather unorthodox couple therapist in ABC Family &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot; (opposite Melissa Joan Hart and Joey Lawrence) and Zooey Deschanel&#x27;s irresponsible and lazy boss in the Fox sitcom &quot;New Girl&quot;.She also played the title role in Greg Lauren&#x27;s short film &quot;The Fashion Designer&quot;, part of Six01 Studio&#x27;s installation &quot;The Blackout&quot;, depicting New York archetypes. The installation was shown in Bryant Park in January 2014.&lt;br&gt;Additionally, she reunited once again with Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Mario Lopez and Tiffani Thiessen on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, where they participated in a &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; sketch with Fallon and Dennis Haskins.

===&quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; reboot and comeback (2020–present)===
In September 2019, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that NBCUniversal&#x27;s upcoming streaming service, Peacock was teaming with Berkley and Mario Lopez for a &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; sequel series. Both actors were set to star and also produce the new show.
&quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, originally set for a summer release, faced several delays in production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and wrapped filming in September 2020. On November 25, the day the show premiered, Berkley and Lopez, alongside Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Tiffani Thiessen appeared as guests on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The show was renewed for a second season, released in November 2021, but despite the strong reviews and the Outstanding Comedy Series award won at the 33rd GLAAD Media Awards, it was cancelled in May 2022.

On November 22, 2021, Berkley joined Abel &quot;The Weeknd&quot; Tesfaye, Lily-Rose Depp, Suzanna Son, Steve Zissis, Anne Heche, Juliebeth Gonzalez and Troye Sivan in Sam Levinson&#x27;s upcoming HBO series &quot;The Idol&quot;. Directed by Amy Seimetz, the show began production in Los Angeles in November. Berkley played a pivotal supporting role but on April 25, 2022, with roughly 80% of the series already filmed, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the show was set to undergo a major overhaul, with &quot;drastic&quot; changes in the cast and creative directions. It was later announced that most of the main and supporting cast members, including Berkley, Heche, Gonzalez and Zissis were no longer part of the project, which was quickly re-written, re-cast and re-shot, with Levinson&#x27;s taking over directing duties from Seimetz. The series was widely panned upon release and was canceled after one season in August 2023.

In 2024 Berkley returned to the big screen, playing the opening victim in Max Minghella&#x27;s &quot;Shell&quot;, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. The same year, she received three stading ovations when she introduced a sold-out, 35-mm special screening of &quot;Showgirls&quot; at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. During her speech, the actress acknowledged the importance of the queer audience: “I&#x27;m so grateful that the film has found its way not only in your hearts but especially the LGBTQ community. You stood by the film. You always believed”.

In June 2024, the producers of &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; (reportedly fans of Berkley from their childhood) offered her the role of Moon Taylor&#x27;s mom Winnie, a character that had been referenced several times over the course of the seasons, but had never been shown. 
Berkley filmed her scenes on the final day of production for both Ralph Macchio and Courtney Henggeler in Atlanta. The show&#x27;s co-lead William Zabka directed the episode.

In September 2024, she booked a guest starring role in Ryan Murphy&#x27;s Hulu legal drama &quot;All&#x27;s Fair&quot;.

==Ask-Elizabeth==
In 2006, Berkley began facilitating small interactive self-esteem workshops with teen girls all around the United States. She would guide the group in order to create a safe space for the girls and let them open up about any problem they wanted to discuss, from body image issues, dating to goals and dreams. The first workshop was held in New York City but the program&#x27;s popularity quickly grew. A non-profit organization was formed and a dedicated, interactive website was launched in 2007.

&quot;Ask-Elizabeth&quot; was also the working title of a reality series focusing on the program&#x27;s success and its continued efforts to help girls throughout the country. Produced by MTV in collaboration with Berkley&#x27;s newly-created company 5–6–7–8 Productions, the show featured Berkley traveling around the US, examining issues and topics most important to teenaged girls. Amy Bailey, vice president of development in MTV&#x27;s News and Documentaries division, said Berkley approached MTV with the idea. &quot;She does these workshops around the country with teen girls and gets them to really open up about self-esteem and body issues&quot;, said Bailey. &quot;We had been looking for a program that tackled the same issues, so it seemed like a perfect match.&quot; Originally expected to premiere in late 2008, the series never materialized.

However, in 2011, Berkley put together the 15 most frequently asked questions from the workshops and published &quot;Ask-Elizabeth&quot; through the Penguin Group. Designed by Berkley and her artist husband Greg Lauren to look like a personal diary, the book was a huge success and quickly became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller.

==Personal life==

Berkley is married to former actor, artist and fashion designer Greg Lauren, nephew of Ralph Lauren and son of Jerry Lauren, at the time executive vice president of men&#x27;s design at Polo Ralph Lauren. The couple met in 2000 during a dance class and were introduced by a mutual friend. They got engaged in 2002 and on November 1, 2003, they got married at the Esperanza Hotel in Cabo San Lucas. Berkley&#x27;s dress, a silk sheath with pearled spaghetti straps, was the first wedding gown designed by Ralph Lauren.

She then formally changed her name to Elizabeth Berkley Lauren, and often uses it professionally as well. The couple welcomed their first son, Skye Cole Lauren, in July 2012.

Berkley had previously dated actor and screenwriter Roger Wilson from 1997 to 1999. She is good friends with actresses Ele Keats, Jennifer Beals and Carla Gugino.

Berkley is a vegetarian, and she doesn&#x27;t smoke or drink alcohol.
==Activism==

Over the years, Berkley has been an active supporter of several organizations dedicated to environmental protection, the promotion of vegetarianism, and the health of younger and older people. According to the eighth annual Sesame Place Kids Poll conducted at Sesame Place (Philadelphia) in September 1993, Elizabeth was voted second-best public person to encourage recycling, partially due to the activism of her &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; character Jessie Spano. Basketball superstar Michael Jordan outpolled her with 33% of votes (Elizabeth was favored by 22 percent). Next came Chelsea Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.

In 1997, she appeared in the &quot;Lettuce Be Lean&quot; campaign sponsored by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to promote a larger range of vegetarian options in restaurants. For the campaign, she donned a $600 form-fitting gown made entirely of collard greens. She later took part in other charity events by the organization.

In May 1996, she was a guest model, along with Naomi Campbell, Janice Dickinson and other female celebrities, at Todd Oldham&#x27;s LA Fashion Show. The event raised $600,000 for the AIDS Project Los Angeles.

In December 2005, Berkley and Adrian Grenier were among the judges for the &quot;Cool vs. Cruel&quot; design contest, where several young designers launched their fledgling careers recreating existing animal-fur fashions with fur-free materials that don&#x27;t harm animals. Berkley spoke of the fur-free issue as one close to her heart since her childhood, when she first realized how unnecessary and cruel it is to take fur from animals in order to satisfy human vanity. &quot;As I youngster, when I would see women wearing fur coats in beauty salons, I would slip cards saying, &quot;this fur would look better on its owner&quot; into their pockets.&quot; She also autographed a Fur-Free Pledge poster with actor Grant Aleksander. The three winning designers were Rocio Penuelas, Jacinta Ligon e Ricardo Auguste.

In June 2009, she joined actress Thandie Newton in Henley on Klip, South Africa to lead workshops at Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Leadership Academy for Girls. At the time, she was also running a monthly column for teen girls in Oprah&#x27;s website.

In October 2010, Berkley, along with Alec Baldwin, Slash, Nigel Barker, Bill Maher, Patrick McDonnell became supporters of the &quot;Shark-Free Marina Initiative&quot; to help combat sharks&#x27; disappearances from world&#x27;s oceans. Sponsored by the Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation and the Humane Society of the United States, the initiative reached out marinas across the world asking them to get involved by prohibiting sharks from being landed at their dock.

She has supported the work of other charities and organizations including the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS foundation and the Motion Picture Home for the Aging. In 2011, Candie&#x27;s Foundation honored her during their annual &quot;Even to Prevent&quot;, thanks to her work in raising awareness about the consequences of teen pregnancy in the United States.

<text>The title of Grand Duke of Tuscany was created on 27 August 1569 by a papal bull of Pope Pius V to Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, member of the illustrious House of Medici. His coronation took place in Rome on 5 March 1570 by the hands of the Pope himself.

Cosimo&#x27;s family, the Medici dynasty, had been ruling the Florentine Republic, the predecessor of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, since 1434, first as Lords of Florence and later as Dukes. The title of Grand Duke, was in fact the second title of recognition within the Tuscan politics given by a Pope to the Medici family, the first being that of Duke of the Florentine Republic, created by Pope Clement VII in 1532.

The official residence of the Grand Dukes was the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, bought by the Medici in 1549.

== Background ==

Margraves reigned in the 9th century when the region was part of the Margraviate of Tuscany. Beginning in the 11th century, the region was fully divided into several independent cities, which included Pisa, Florence, Siena, Lucca, Arezzo among others. However, with the territorial expansion of Florence, Tuscany began to &quot;come together&quot; again under one single leadership. This situation became even clearer with the creation of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1569. Over the years, the Grand duchy managed to absorb practically the entire region of present-day Tuscany, until its own final annexation to the Kingdom of Italy.

==Medici grand dukes of Tuscany, 1569–1737==
The Grand Duchy of Tuscany was the first period after centuries of political divisions, when most of the region was under the rule of a single leader. The Grand Duchy&#x27;s territory comprised almost the entire region of present-day Tuscany, with the exception of the Republic of Lucca, the Principality of Piombino, the Duchy of Massa and Carrara and the State of the Presidi.
==Habsburg-Lorraine grand dukes of Tuscany, 1737–1801==

==Bourbon-Parma kings of Etruria, 1801–1807==
Period that the Bourbon-Parma were placed as &quot;Kings&quot; by Napoleon in the Kingdom of Etruria. The Kingdom was a creation of Napoleon to replace the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, comprising a large part of modern Tuscany.
&quot;Tuscany was annexed by France, 1807–1814. Napoleon&#x27;s sister Elisa Bonaparte was given the honorary title of &quot;Grand Duchess of Tuscany&quot;, but did not actually rule over the region.&quot;
==Habsburg-Lorraine grand dukes of Tuscany, 1814–1860==

&quot;Leopoldo II was driven from Tuscany by revolution from 21 February to 12 April 1849, and again on 27 April 1859. He abdicated in favor of his son, Ferdinando IV, on 21 July 1859, but Ferdinando IV was never recognized in Tuscany, and was deposed by the provisional government on 16 August. Tuscany was annexed by Piedmont-Sardinia on 22 March 1860.&quot;

<doc id="235475" wikidata="Q510022" url="?curid=235475" title="Western grey kangaroo">
<text>The western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus), also referred to as a western grey giant kangaroo, black-faced kangaroo, mallee kangaroo, sooty kangaroo and (when referring to the Kangaroo Island subspecies) Kangaroo Island grey kangaroo, is a large and very common kangaroo found across almost the entire southern part of Australia, from just south of Shark Bay through coastal Western Australia and South Australia, into western Victoria, and in the entire Murray–Darling basin in New South Wales and Queensland.

==Taxonomy==
Long known to the Aboriginal Australians, for Europeans, the western grey kangaroo was the centre of a great deal of sometimes comical taxonomic confusion for almost 200 years. It was first noted by European explorers when Matthew Flinders landed on Kangaroo Island in 1802. Flinders shot several for food, but assumed that they were eastern grey kangaroos. In 1803, French explorers captured several Kangaroo Island western grey kangaroos and shipped them to Paris, where they lived in the &quot;Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes&quot; for some years. Eventually, researchers at the Paris Museum of Natural History recognized that these animals were indeed distinct from the eastern grey kangaroo and formally described the species as &quot;Macropus fuliginosus&quot; in 1817. For reasons that remain unclear, the species was, later in 1888, incorrectly described as native to Tasmania. It was not until 1924 that researchers realized that the &quot;forester kangaroo&quot; of Tasmania was in fact &quot;Macropus giganteus&quot;, the same eastern grey kangaroo that was, and still is, widespread in the southeastern part of the mainland, and reaffirmed Kangaroo Island as the source of the type specimens. By 1971, it was understood that the Kangaroo Island western grey kangaroo belonged to the same species as the kangaroos of southern and Western Australia, and that this population extended through much of the eastern part of the continent as well (see range map). For a time, three subspecies were described, two on the mainland and one on Kangaroo Island. The current classification scheme emerged in the 1990s.

The western grey kangaroo is not found in the north or the far southeast of Australia, and the eastern grey does not extend beyond the New South Wales–South Australia border, but the two species are both common in the Murray–Darling basin area. They never interbreed in the wild, although it has proved possible to produce hybrids between eastern grey females and western grey males in captivity.

===Subspecies===
There are two subspecies:
*&quot;Macropus fuliginosus fuliginosus&quot; (commonly known as the Kangaroo Island western grey kangaroo or simply Kangaroo Island grey kangaroo) is endemic to Kangaroo Island, South Australia
*&quot;Macropus fuliginosus melanops&quot; has a range of different forms that intergrade clinally from west to east.

==Description==
The western grey kangaroo is one of the largest macropods in Australia. It weighs and its length is with a tail, standing approximately tall. It exhibits sexual dimorphism with the male up to twice the size of female. It has thick, coarse fur with colour ranging from pale grey to brown; its throat, chest and belly have a paler colour.
This species is difficult to distinguish from its sibling species, the eastern grey kangaroo (&quot;Macropus giganteus&quot;). However, the western grey kangaroo has darker grey-brown fur, darker colouration around the head, and sometimes has a blackish patch around the elbow.

==Ecology and behaviour==

===Diet===
It feeds at night, mainly on grasses and forbs but also on leafy shrubs and low trees. During the Late Pleistocene, its diet was more varied and incorporated a greater proportion of C4 plants relative to that of present western grey kangaroos. It has a nickname &quot;stinker&quot; because mature males have a distinctive curry-like odour.

===Thermoregulation===
The western grey kangaroo is a nocturnal species that varies its core body temperature based on daily ambient temperatures. The kangaroo&#x27;s lowest daily core body temperature occurs mid-morning. In the summer, this was 2.2 °C (4 °F) lower than during cooler spring days. This reduced summer body temperature is thought to allow the species to conserve energy during a time when food availability is low.

===Reproduction and development===
The western grey kangaroo lives in groups of up to 15, and the males compete for females during the breeding season. During these &quot;boxing&quot; contests, they lock arms and try to push each other over. Usually, only the dominant male in the group mates. The gestation period is 30–31 days, after which the incompletely developed fetus (referred to as a &quot;joey&quot;) attaches to the teat in the pouch for 130–150 days. Females reach sexual maturity at 17 months while males mature at around 20 months.

The western grey kangaroo is closely related to the eastern grey kangaroo (&quot;M. giganteus&quot;), and their distribution overlaps extensively, especially in the Murray–Darling basin. However, the two species interbreed only rarely in the wild. Although hybridisation occurs in both directions in the overlap zone between the two species, this does not seem to be the case with captive animals. Although interbreeding between the two species does occasionally occur in captive animals, viable offspring are only produced when the mating pair consists of a female eastern grey kangaroo and a male western grey kangaroo. This is an example of unidirectional hybridisation.

==Relationship with humans==
The western grey kangaroo is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List, with a population showing an increasing trend. Total population within the commercial harvest areas is estimated to be around 3,781,023 individuals in 2020.

Though the feeding habits of &quot;M. fuliginosus&quot; can be problematic for agriculture, it is protected and controlled exclusively by the state faunal authorities. Because it is considered a competitor for water and pasture by ranchers, this species is considered a pest in some areas. To limit agricultural damage, kangaroo culling has been allowed under license every year.

Commercial hunting for meat and skin also allowed under regulation, with skins providing a high-quality, long-lasting leather. About 40% of harvested meat is used for human consumption; leather is used as a material for handbags, briefcases, and belts.

Commercial hunting is permitted in New South Wales, mainland South Australia, and Western Australia, but prohibited in Tasmania, Northern Territory and Kangaroo Island.

<text>A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, networks or applications for known weaknesses. These scanners are used to discover the weaknesses of a given system. They are used in the identification and detection of vulnerabilities arising from mis-configurations or flawed programming within a network-based asset such as a firewall, router, web server, application server, etc. Modern vulnerability scanners allow for both authenticated and unauthenticated scans. Modern scanners are typically available as SaaS (Software as a Service); provided over the internet and delivered as a web application. The modern vulnerability scanner often has the ability to customize vulnerability reports as well as the installed software, open ports, certificates and other host information that can be queried as part of its workflow. 
* Authenticated scans allow for the scanner to directly access network based assets using remote administrative protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP) and authenticate using provided system credentials. This allows the vulnerability scanner to access low-level data, such as specific services and configuration details of the host operating system. It&#x27;s then able to provide detailed and accurate information about the operating system and installed software, including configuration issues and missing security patches.
* Unauthenticated scans is a method that can result in a high number of false positives and is unable to provide detailed information about the assets operating system and installed software. This method is typically used by threat actors or security analyst trying determine the security posture of externally accessible assets.
Vulnerability scanners should be able to detect the risks in open-source dependencies. However, since developers will usually re-bundle the OSS, the same code will appear in different dependencies, which will then impact the performance and ability of scanners to detect the vulnerable OSS.

The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense designates continuous vulnerability scanning as a critical control for effective cyber defense.

<text>Robert Sedgewick (born December 20, 1946) is an American computer scientist. He is the founding chair and the William O. Baker Professor in Computer Science at Princeton University and was a member of the board of directors of Adobe Systems (1990–2016). He previously served on the faculty at Brown University and has held visiting research positions at Xerox PARC, Institute for Defense Analyses, and INRIA. His research expertise is in algorithm science, data structures, and analytic combinatorics. He is also active in developing college curriculums in computer science.

== Early life ==

Sedgewick was born on December 20, 1946, in Willimantic, Connecticut. During his childhood he lived in Storrs, Connecticut, where his parents Charles Hill Wallace Sedgewick and Rose Whelan Sedgewick were professors at the University of Connecticut.

In 1958, he moved with his parents to Wheaton, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., where he attended Wheaton High School, graduating in 1964.

== Education ==

Sedgewick earned his Bachelor of Science (1968) and Master of Science (1969) degrees in applied mathematics from Brown University, where he was a student of Andries van Dam. He went on to graduate work at Stanford University where he was an advisee of Donald E. Knuth, receiving his PhD in 1975. His thesis was entitled &quot;Quicksort&quot; and was named an outstanding dissertation in computer science.

== Work and academic career ==

Sedgewick returned to Brown to start his academic career as an assistant professor in 1975, with promotion to associate professor in 1980 and full professor in 1983. At Brown, he participated in the founding of the computer science department, in 1979.

In 1985, Sedgewick joined the faculty at Princeton University as founding chair of the Department of Computer Science where he later became the William O. Baker &#x27;39 Professor of Computer Science. The first-year courses in computer science that he developed at Princeton became quite popular. He also replaced live lectures with on-demand online videos.

Throughout his career, he has worked at research institutions outside of academia during summers and sabbatical leaves:
*The Communications Research Division of the Institute for Defense Analyses in Princeton, New Jersey, working on the CRAY-1 supercomputer.
*Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) with some of the early personal computers
*The Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA) in France, in collaboration with Philippe Flajolet.

== Research and writing ==

Sedgewick developed red–black trees (with Leonidas J. Guibas), ternary search trees (with Jon Bentley), and pairing heaps (with R. E. Tarjan and Michael Fredman). He solved open problems left by Donald Knuth in the analysis of quicksort, shellsort, heapsort (with R. Schaffer), and Batcher&#x27;s sort. With Philippe Flajolet, he developed the field of mathematics known as analytic combinatorics.

He has organized research meetings and conferences on data structures, algorithm science, and analytic combinatorics around the world, including Dagstuhl seminars on analysis of algorithms and data structures. In particular, in 1993, together with Rainer Kemp, Philippe Flajolet and Helmut Prodinger, he initiated a series of workshops and conferences which was key to the development of a research community around the analysis of algorithms, and which evolved into the AofA—International Meeting on Combinatorial, Probabilistic, and Asymptotic Methods in the Analysis of Algorithms. Robert Sedgewick was also the main proponent and organizer of the first editions of the SIAM Meetings on Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO), a series of meetings annually held from 2004 to 2019, co-located with the Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA).

== Publishing ==

Sedgewick is the author of twenty books, including &quot;Algorithms&quot;, originally published in 1983. His 2008 book with Philippe Flajolet, &quot;Analytic Combinatorics&quot;, was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for mathematical exposition by the American Mathematical Society. More recently, he co-authored with Kevin Wayne the book &quot;Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach&quot;.

== Online learning ==
Sedgewick has developed massive open online courses in his area. With Kevin Wayne, he developed a model that integrates the textbook, studio-produced online lectures, and online content. These have had over one million registrants. He advocates for expanding the reach of computer science, with essays published in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot;.

<text>Erwin Chargaff (11 August 1905 – 20 June 2002) was an Austro-Hungarian-born American biochemist, writer, and professor of biochemistry at Columbia University medical school. A Bucovinian Jew who emigrated to the United States during the Nazi regime, he penned a well-reviewed autobiography, &quot;Heraclitean Fire: Sketches from a Life Before Nature&quot;.

==Early life==
Chargaff was born on 11 August 1905 to a Jewish family in Czernowitz, Duchy of Bukovina, Austria-Hungary, which is now Chernivtsi, Ukraine.

At the outbreak of World War I, his family moved to Vienna, where he attended the Maximiliansgymnasium (now the Gymnasium Wasagasse). He then went on to the Vienna College of Technology (&quot;Technische Hochschule Wien&quot;) where he met his future wife Vera Broido.

From 1924 to 1928, Chargaff studied chemistry in Vienna, and earned a doctorate working under the direction of Fritz Feigl.

He married Vera Broido in 1928. Chargaff had one son, Thomas Chargaff.

From 1925 to 1930, Chargaff served as the Milton Campbell Research fellow in organic chemistry at Yale University, but he did not like New Haven, Connecticut. Chargaff returned to Europe, where he lived from 1930 to 1934, serving first as the assistant in charge of chemistry for the department of bacteriology and public health at the University of Berlin (1930–1933) and then, being forced to resign his position in Germany as a result of the Nazi policies against Jews, as a research associate at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (1933–1934).

==Columbia University==
Chargaff immigrated to Manhattan, New York City in 1935, taking a position as a research associate in the department of biochemistry at Columbia University, where he spent most of his professional career. Chargaff became an assistant professor in 1938 and a professor in 1952. After serving as department chair from 1970 to 1974, Chargaff retired as professor emeritus. After his retirement as professor emeritus, Chargaff moved his lab to Roosevelt Hospital, where he continued to work until his retirement in 1992.

He became an American citizen in 1940.

During his time at Columbia, Chargaff published numerous scientific papers, dealing primarily with the study of nucleic acids such as DNA using chromatographic techniques. He became interested in DNA in 1944 after Oswald Avery identified the molecule as the basis of heredity. Cohen says that &quot;Almost alone among the scientists of this time, Chargaff accepted the unusual Avery paper and concluded that genetic differences among DNAs must be reflected in chemical differences among these substances. He was actually the first biochemist to reorganize his laboratory to test this hypothesis, which he went on to prove by 1949.&quot; Chargaff said of the Avery discovery: &quot;I saw before me (in 1944), in dark contours, the beginning of a grammar of biology&quot;, and in 1950 he published a paper with the conclusion that the amounts of adenine and thymine in DNA were roughly the same, as were the amounts of cytosine and guanine. This later became known as the first of Chargaff&#x27;s rules. Instrumental in his DNA discoveries were the innovation of paper chromatography, and the commercially-available ultraviolet spectrophotometer tool.

Chargaff lectured about his results at Cambridge University in 1952, with Watson and Crick in attendance.

==Chargaff&#x27;s rules==

Key conclusions from Erwin Chargaff&#x27;s work are now known as Chargaff&#x27;s rules. The first and best known achievement was to show that in natural DNA the number of guanine units equals the number of cytosine units and the number of adenine units equals the number of thymine units. In human DNA, for example, the four bases are present in these percentages: A=30.9% and T=29.4%; G=19.9% and C=19.8%. This strongly hinted towards the base pair makeup of the DNA, although Chargaff did not explicitly state this connection himself. For this research, Chargaff is credited with disproving the tetranucleotide hypothesis (Phoebus Levene&#x27;s widely accepted hypothesis that DNA was composed of a large number of repeats of GACT). Most researchers had previously assumed that deviations from equimolar base ratios (G = A = C = T) were due to experimental error, but Chargaff documented that the variation was real, with [C + G] typically being slightly less abundant. He did his experiments with the newly developed paper chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometer. Chargaff met Francis Crick and James D. Watson at Cambridge in 1952, and, despite not getting along with them personally, he explained his findings to them. Chargaff&#x27;s research would later help the Watson and Crick laboratory team to deduce the double helical structure of DNA.

The second of Chargaff&#x27;s rules is that the composition of DNA varies from one species to another, in particular in the relative amounts of A, G, T, and C bases. Such evidence of molecular diversity, which had been presumed absent from DNA, made DNA a more credible candidate for the genetic material than protein.

==Later life==
Beginning in the 1950s, Chargaff became increasingly outspoken about the failure of the field of molecular biology, claiming that molecular biology was &quot;running riot and doing things that can never be justified&quot;. He believed that human knowledge will always be limited in relation to the complexity of the natural world, and that it is simply dangerous when humans believe that the world is a machine, even assuming that humans can have full knowledge of its workings. He also believed that in a world that functions as a complex system of interdependency and interconnectedness, genetic engineering of life will inevitably have unforeseen consequences.

After Francis Crick, James Watson and Maurice Wilkins received the 1962 Nobel Prize for their work on discovering the double helix of DNA, Chargaff withdrew from his lab and wrote to scientists all over the world about his exclusion.

Chargaff warned in his 1978 book &quot;Heraclitean Fire&quot; of a &quot;molecular Auschwitz&quot; that &quot;the technology of genetic engineering poses a greater threat to the world than the advent of nuclear technology. An irreversible attack on the biosphere is something so unheard of, so unthinkable to previous generations, that I only wish that mine had not been guilty of it&quot;.

The IVF technique earned his scathing disapprobation. In 1987, &quot;Engineering a Molecular Nightmare&quot; was published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, which was then sent by David Alton and his colleagues in the All-Party Parliamentary Pro-Life Group (APPPLG) to every Westminster MP in an effort to minimise the forthcoming harm caused by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.

Chargaff wrote in 2002 that &quot;There are two nuclei that man should never have touched: the atomic nucleus and the cell nucleus. The technology of genetic engineering poses a greater threat to the world than the advent of nuclear technology.&quot;

Chargaff died later that year on 20 June 2002 in Manhattan, New York City. He is buried in Mount Carmel Cemetery (Queens).

==Honors==
Honors awarded to him include the Pasteur Medal (1949); Carl Neuberg Medal (1958); Charles Leopold Mayer Prize; inaugural Heineken Prize (Amsterdam, 1964); Gregor Mendel Medal (Halle, 1968); and the National Medal of Science (1974).

Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1961), the National Academy of Sciences (1965), and the American Philosophical Society (1979) and the German Academy of Sciences.

Honorary Doctorate awarded by Columbia University in 1975.

<text>Shakeel Badayuni (3 August 1916 – 20 April 1970) was an Indian Urdu poet, lyricist and songwriter in Hindi / Urdu language films.

==Early life==
Shakeel Badayuni was born in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh. His father, Mohammed Jamaal Ahmed Sokhta Qadiri, wanted him to have a successful career, thus he arranged Arabic, Urdu, Persian, and Hindi tuition for Shakeel at home. His inclination towards poetry was not hereditary like other . One of his distant relatives, Zia-ul-Qadiri Badayuni, was a religious . Shakeel Masoodi was influenced by him and the contemporary environment of Badayun led him to poetry.

When he joined Aligarh Muslim University in 1936, he started participating in inter-college, inter-university &quot;mushairas&quot;, or poetry recitation symposiums, and won frequently. In 1940, he married Salma, who was his distant relative and had been living in a common house with him since childhood. However, the &quot;purdah&quot; system was strictly observed in their family and they were not close. After completing his BA, he moved to Delhi as a supply officer, but continued participating in &quot;mushairas&quot;, earning fame nationwide. Those were the days of who wrote about the downtrodden sections of society, their emancipation, and the betterment of society. But Shakeel had an altogether different taste – his poetry was romantic and close to the heart. Shakeel used to say:

:&quot;Main Shakeel Dil Ka Hoon Tarjuman&quot;
:&quot;Keh Mohabbaton Ka Hoon Raazdaan&quot;
:&quot;Mujhe Fakhr Hai Meri Shayari&quot;
:&quot;Meri Zindagi Se Juda Nahin&quot;

During his Aligarh days, Badauni also started learning Urdu poetry formally from Hakim Abdul Waheed &#x27;Ashk&#x27; Bijnori.

==Career==
Shakeel moved to Bombay in 1944, to write songs for films. He met film producer, A.R. Kardar and music composer, Naushad Ali, who asked him to sum up his poetic skills in one line. Shakeel wrote, &quot;Hum Dard Ka Afsana Duniya Ko Suna Denge, Har Dil Main Mohabbat Ki Ek Aag Laga Dengey&quot;. Naushad immediately retained him for Kardar&#x27;s film, &quot;Dard&quot; (1947). The songs of &quot;Dard&quot; proved to be very successful, especially Uma Devi (Tun Tun)&#x27;s &quot;Afsana Likh Rahi Hoon&quot;. Only a few are so lucky that they attain success in their first film, but Shakeel deserved success which started with &quot;Dard&quot; and continued on over the years.

Together, he and Naushad became one of the most sought after composer/lyricist duos in the industry. Among the scores they churned out together, are those of &quot;Deedar&quot; (1951), &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot; (1952), &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), and &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960), that stand out. Other films they scored together include &quot;Dulari&quot; (1949), &quot;Shabab&quot; (1954), &quot;Ganga Jamuna&quot; (1961), and &quot;Mere Mehboob&quot; (1963). Although Shakeel Badayuni worked most extensively with Naushad, he also collaborated with Ravi and Hemant Kumar. His lyrics for the song &quot;Husnwale Tera Jawab Nahin&quot; and Ravi&#x27;s music score both won Filmfare Awards for the hit film &quot;Gharana&quot;. His other notable film with Ravi is &quot;Chaudhvin Ka Chand&quot; (1960), while &quot;Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam&quot; (1962) is his biggest hit with Hemant Kumar. The title song from &quot;Chaudhvin Ka Chand&quot;, rendered by Mohammed Rafi, won Badayuni the Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist in 1961.

Shakeel penned numbers for around 89 films. In addition, he wrote many popular &quot;ghazals&quot; sung by Begum Akhtar, which are still sung by vocalists like Pankaj Udhas and others.

The Indian government had honoured him with the title &quot;Geet Kar-e-Azam&quot;.

;Association with Naushad

Shakeel shared a close friendship with Naushad, Ravi, and Naushad&#x27;s former assistant, Ghulam Mohammed, with whom he enjoyed his life to the fullest. Naushad used Shakeel as the lyricist for his tunes for most of his films for a period of 24 years. Baiju Bawra, which was a milestone in both of their careers, was supposed to go to Kavi Pradeep. Vijay Bhatt, the director of the movie was insistent on using Kavi Pradeep as the lyricist, since the film was supposed to have many devotional songs. Naushad requested Vijay Bhatt to hear the lyrics written by Shakeel. Vijay Bhatt agreed.

When Shakeel Badayuni was diagnosed with tuberculosis, he was put up in a sanatorium in Panchgani for treatment. Naushad knowing that his financial condition was not good, took 3 films to him, getting the lyrics written in the sanatorium, and got him a payment of nearly 10 times more than his normal fees.

;Association with Ravi

Shakeel also wrote a substantial chunk of songs for music director Ravi Sharma. Prominent amongst them were &quot;Chaudhvin Ka Chand&quot; (1960), &quot;Gharana&quot; (1961), &quot;Ghunghat&quot;, &quot;Grahasti&quot; (1963), &quot;Nartaki&quot; (1963), as well as &quot;Phool Aur Patthar&quot; and &quot;Do Badan&quot; (both released in 1966).

;Association with Hemant Kumar

Shakeel wrote for Hemant Kumar for movies like &quot;Bees Saal Baad&quot; (1962), &quot;Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam&quot; (1962), &quot;Bin Badal Barsaat&quot;.

;Association with S.D. Burman

Shakeel penned lyrics for the tunes of S.D. Burman for movies Kaise Kahoon &amp; Benazir.

;Others

C.Ramachandra – Zindagi Aur Maut, Wahan Ke Log.
Roshan – Bedaag, Noorjahan.

==Personal life==
Shakeel Badayuni succumbed to diabetes complications at the age of fifty-three, on 20 April 1970, at Bombay Hospital leaving behind his wife, two sons and two daughters. One daughter, Najma, died soon afterwards, while still a college student. His elder son Javed and grandson Zeeshan work in the travel and tourism industry. His other son&#x27;s name is Tariq. Shakeel&#x27;s friends Ahmed Zakaria and Rangoonwala formed a trust called &quot;Yaad-e-Shakeel&quot; after his death and this trust became the source of some income for his bereaved family.

Shakeel loved to play badminton, go on picnics and hunting trips and fly kites with his friends from the industry, Naushad and Mohammed Rafi. Sometimes Johnny Walker would join them in kite-flying competitions. Dilip Kumar, writers Wajahat Mirza, Khumar Barabankvi and Azm Bazidpuri were among Shakeel&#x27;s other close friends within the industry.

==His 25 best songs==
Badayuni penned several memorable songs in his career. Some of his popular works include the musical &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot; (1952), historical epic &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960) and social &quot;Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam&quot; (1962)&quot;.&quot;

<text>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is a combat support agency within the United States Department of Defense whose primary mission is collecting, analyzing, and distributing geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) in support of national security. Initially known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) from 1996 to 2003, it is a member of the United States Intelligence Community.

NGA headquarters, also known as NGA Campus East or NCE, is located at Fort Belvoir North Area in Springfield, Virginia. The agency also operates major facilities in the St. Louis, Missouri area (referred to as NGA Campus West or NCW), as well as support and liaison offices worldwide. The NGA headquarters, at , is the third-largest government building in the Washington metropolitan area after The Pentagon and the Ronald Reagan Building.

In addition to using GEOINT for U.S. military and intelligence efforts, NGA assists during natural and artificial disasters, aids in security planning for major events such as the Olympic Games, disseminates maritime safety information, and gathers data on climate change.

The eighth and current director of the agency is Vice Admiral Frank D. Whitworth III.

==History==
U.S. mapping and charting efforts remained relatively unchanged until World War I, when aerial photography became a major contributor to battlefield intelligence. Using stereo viewers, photo-interpreters reviewed thousands of images. Many were of the same target at different angles and times, giving rise to modern imagery analysis and mapmaking.

===Engineer Reproduction Plant (ERP)===
The Engineer Reproduction Plant was the Army Corps of Engineers&#x27;s first attempt to centralize mapping production, printing, and distribution. It was located on the grounds of the Army War College in Washington, D.C. Previously, topographic mapping had primarily been a function of individual field engineer units using field surveying techniques or copying existing or captured products. In addition, ERP assumed the &quot;supervision and maintenance&quot; of the War Department Map Collection, effective April 1, 1939.

===Army Map Service (AMS) / U.S. Army Topographic Command (USATC)===
With the advent of the Second World War aviation, field surveys began giving way to photogrammetry, photo interpretation, and geodesy. During wartime, compiling maps with minimal field work became increasingly possible. Out of this emerged AMS, which absorbed the existing ERP in May 1942. It was located at the Dalecarlia Site (including buildings now named for John C. Frémont and Charles H. Ruth) on MacArthur Blvd., just outside Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County, Maryland, and adjacent to the Dalecarlia Reservoir. AMS was designated as an Engineer field activity, effective July 1, 1942, by General Order 22, OCE, June 19, 1942. The Army Map Service also combined many of the Army&#x27;s remaining geographic intelligence organizations and the Engineer Technical Intelligence Division. AMS was redesignated the U.S. Army Topographic Command (USATC) on September 1, 1968, and continued as an independent organization until 1972, when it was merged into the new Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) and redesignated as the DMA Topographic Center (DMATC) (see below).

===Aeronautical Chart Plant (ACP)===

After the war, the need for charts grew as airplane capacity and range improved. The Army Air Corps established its map unit, which was renamed ACP in 1943 and was located in St. Louis, Missouri. ACP was known as the U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Chart and Information Center (ACIC) from 1952 to 1972 (See DMAAC below).

=== National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) ===

Shortly before leaving office in January 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower authorized the creation of the National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC), a joint project of the CIA and DIA. NPIC was a component of the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Science and Technology (DDS&amp;T), and its primary function was imagery analysis. NPIC became part of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (now NGA) in 1996.

;Directors of NPIC
====Cuban Missile Crisis====

NPIC first identified the Soviet Union&#x27;s basing of missiles in Cuba in 1962. By exploiting images from U-2 overflights and film from canisters ejected by orbiting Corona satellites, NPIC analysts developed the information necessary to inform U.S. policymakers and influence operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Their analysis garnered worldwide attention when the Kennedy Administration declassified and made public a portion of the images depicting the Soviet missiles on Cuban soil; Adlai Stevenson presented the images to the United Nations Security Council on October 25, 1962.

===Defense Mapping Agency (DMA)===
The Defense Mapping Agency was created on January 1, 1972, to consolidate all U.S. military mapping activities. DMA&#x27;s &quot;birth certificate&quot;, DoD Directive 5105.40, resulted from a formerly classified Presidential directive, &quot;Organization and Management of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Community&quot; (November 5, 1971), which directed the consolidation of mapping functions previously dispersed among the military services. DMA became operational on July 1, 1972, pursuant to General Order 3, DMA (June 16, 1972). On October 1, 1996, DMA was folded into the National Imagery and Mapping Agency – which later became NGA.

DMA was first headquartered at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., then at Falls Church, Virginia. Its mostly civilian workforce was concentrated at production sites in Bethesda, Maryland, Northern Virginia, and St. Louis, Missouri. DMA was formed from the Mapping, Charting, and Geodesy Division, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and from various mapping-related organizations of the military services.
* DMA Hydrographic Center (DMAHC)
DMAHC was formed in 1972 when the Navy&#x27;s Hydrographic Office split its two components: The charting component was attached to DMAHC, and the survey component moved to the Naval Oceanographic Office, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, on the grounds of what is now the Stennis Space Center. DMAHC was responsible for creating terrestrial maps of coastal areas worldwide and hydrographic charts for DoD. DMAHC was initially located in Suitland, Maryland, but later relocated to Brookmont (Bethesda), Maryland.
* DMA Topographic Center (DMATC)
DMATC was located in Brookmont (Bethesda), Maryland. It was responsible for creating topographic maps worldwide for DoD. DMATC&#x27;s location in Bethesda, Maryland, is the former site of NGA&#x27;s headquarters.
* DMA Hydrographic/Topographic Center (DMAHTC) 
DMAHC and DMATC eventually merged to form DMAHTC, with offices in Brookmont (Bethesda), Maryland.
* DMA Aerospace Center (DMAAC)
DMAAC originated with the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Aeronautical Chart and Information Center (ACIC) and was located in St. Louis, Missouri.

===National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)===

NIMA was established on October 1, 1996, by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. The creation of NIMA followed more than a year of study, debate, and planning by the defense, intelligence, and policy-making communities (as well as the Congress) and continuing consultations with customer organizations. The creation of NIMA centralized responsibility for imagery and mapping.

NIMA combined the DMA, the Central Imagery Office (CIO), and the Defense Dissemination Program Office (DDPO) in their entirety, as well as the mission and functions of the NPIC. Also merged into NIMA were the imagery exploitation, dissemination, and processing elements of the Defense Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, and the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office.

NIMA&#x27;s creation was clouded by the natural reluctance of cultures to merge and the fear that their respective missions—mapping in support of defense activities versus intelligence production, principally in support of national policymakers—would be subordinated, each to the other.

===NGA===
With the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 on November 24, 2003, NIMA was renamed NGA to reflect better its primary mission in the area of GEOINT.

====2005 BRAC and Impact on NGA====
As a part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, all major Washington, D.C.–area NGA facilities, including those in Bethesda, Maryland; Reston, Virginia; and Washington, D.C., would be consolidated at a new facility at the Fort Belvoir proving grounds. This new facility, later known as NCE, houses several thousand people and is situated on the former Engineer Proving Ground site near Fort Belvoir. NGA facilities in St. Louis were not affected by the 2005 BRAC process.

As of March 2009, the new center&#x27;s cost was expected to be $2.4 billion. The center&#x27;s campus is approximately and was completed in September 2011.

====Next NGA St. Louis====
NGA is currently constructing a new facility in St. Louis, Missouri, Next NGA St. Louis, at a cost of $1.7 billion. The facility is expected to hold 3,000 employees and open by 2025. St. Louis&#x27; city legislature is currently reconsidering legislation to surround Next NGA St. Louis with a protection zone that would bar certain businesses, such as gas stations, hazardous material companies, and foreign government-supported enterprises, from building around the site for security purposes.

==Organization==
===Agency structure===
====Executive Leadership Team====
A director heads NGA, currently Navy Vice Adm. Frank D. Whitworth; the director is followed in precedence by the deputy director and chief of staff, currently Brett Markham. The holders of these three offices comprise NGA&#x27;s executive leadership team.

====Chief of Staff====
While NGA&#x27;s director and deputy director oversee the agency, the Chief of Staff oversees NGA&#x27;s executive support staff, administrative services, logistics, personnel security, human resources, employee training and development, corporate communications, and congressional engagement.

====Directorates and directorate leaders====
NGA is split into various directorates led by directors (D/XX) and associate deputy directors (ADD/XX), with &quot;XX&quot; standing in for each directorate&#x27;s two-letter designation. Known directorates and leadership figures include but are not limited to the: 
* Analysis Directorate, containing the Director of Analytic Operations (D/AO) and Associate Deputy Director for Operational Engagement (ADD/AE) and led by a director, currently Director of Analysis Susan &quot;Sue&quot; Kalweit
* Source Operations &amp; Management Directorate (S or &quot;Source&quot; Directorate), led by the Director of the Source Operations &amp; Management Directorate or Director of Source Operations
* Enterprise Operations Directorate (E or &quot;Enterprise&quot; Directorate), led by the Director of the Enterprise Operations Directorate
* IT Services Directorate
* Plans and Programs Directorate
* Research Directorate
* Security and Installation Operations Directorate (SI)
* Human Development Directorate (HD)
* Financial Management Directorate (FM)
* Unnamed &quot;NGA contracting directorate&quot;
* Acquisitions Directorate
* Unnamed &quot;A Directorate&quot; (possibly Acquisitions or Analysis)
* Unnamed &quot;P Directorate&quot; (possibly Plans and Programs or former Analysis and Production Directorate (see below))

An Analysis and Production Directorate (P or &quot;Production&quot; Directorate) existed in 2011, although NGA presently has a Directorate for Analysis, which may be a replacement or separated portion of the Analysis and Production Directorate.

The deputy associate director of operations directly oversees the NGA Operations Center (itself led by a director and deputy director) the Office of NGA Defense, the Office of Expeditionary Operations, and NGA leadership at the three National Reconnaissance Office Aerospace Data facilities.

====Other internal groups and leaders====
NGA contains NGA Support Teams (NST), which work with directorates, are detailed internationally, deploy with warfighters, or liaise with service branches. Multiple NGA Command NSTs also exist. NGA&#x27;s western operations, such as constructing the Next NGA St. Louis campus in St. Louis, Missouri, is headed by the NGA St. Louis executive (who can concurrently serve in other leadership roles). There is also an NGA Equality Executive. Other organizations present in NGA, which may or may not be components of directorates, include: 
* NGA Operations Center
* Office of Expeditionary Operations
* Office of NGA Defense (OND)
* Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), led by NGA&#x27;s chief information officer
* Office of the Inspector General (OIG), led by NGA&#x27;s Inspector General (currently Cardell Richardson, Sr.)
* Records Service Office 
* National Geospatial-Intelligence Committee (GEOCOM), containing subcommittees
* National Geospatial-Intelligence College (NGC), led by a director
* GEOINT Enterprise Office, led by a director and organized into branches
* Office of Geomatics

* Meteorological Operations Center
* Office of General Counsel (OGC)
* Records and Declassification Program Office
* FOIA/Privacy Act Program Office

Additionally, military Service GEOINT Offices (SGOs) liaise with NGA but belong to their respective military service branches and represent their geospatial intelligence needs. The Canadian Armed Forces deploys a liaison team to NGA; that team&#x27;s operations officer also acts as NGA&#x27;s Commonwealth liaison.

NGA is a member of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG) and the more extensive Allied System for Geospatial Intelligence (ASG), which includes close allies Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The U.S. and those four nations also form the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.

===Employees===
NGA employs professionals in aeronautical analysis, cartography, geospatial analysis, imagery analysis, marine analysis, the physical sciences, geodesy, computer and telecommunication engineering, and photogrammetry, as well as those in the national security and law enforcement fields.

===List of NIMA / NGA Directors===
This table lists all Directors of the NIMA and NGA and their terms of office. The agency transitioned from NIMA to NGA during Lieutenant General King&#x27;s directorship.

*† - Although General Clapper preferred the use of his military rank, he was, in fact, a member of the Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service (DISES) during his term as Director of NGA, as he had retired from active duty as the director of Defense Intelligence Agency in 1995. Clapper was the first civilian to head NIMA / NGA.

==Civilian, Department of Defense, and Intelligence Community activities==

*Osama bin Laden compound raid: NGA was integral in helping the Department of Defense and the U.S. Intelligence Community pinpoint the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan where Osama bin Laden hid for several years and to plan the raid that killed him.
* 9/11 aftermath: After the September 11, 2001 attacks, NIMA partnered with the U.S. Geological Survey to survey the World Trade Center site and determine the extent of the destruction.
* Keyhole investment: NGA contributed approximately 25% of In-Q-Tel&#x27;s funding of Keyhole Inc, whose Earth-viewing software became Google Earth.
* Hurricane Katrina: NGA supported Hurricane Katrina relief efforts by &quot;providing geospatial information about the affected areas based on imagery from commercial and U.S. government satellites, and from airborne platforms, to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other government agencies. NGA&#x27;s Earth website is a central source of these efforts.
* Microsoft partnership: Microsoft Corp. and NGA have signed a letter of understanding to advance the design and delivery of geospatial information applications to customers. NGA will continue to use the Microsoft Virtual Earth platform (as it did for Katrina relief) to provide geospatial support for humanitarian, peacekeeping, and national-security efforts. Virtual Earth is a set of online mapping and search services that deliver imagery through an API.
* Google and GeoEye: In 2008, NGA partnered with Google and GeoEye. Google would be allowed to use GeoEye spy satellite imagery with reduced resolution for Google Earth.
* Open source software on GitHub: April 2014 NGA became the first intelligence agency to open-source software on GitHub. NGA Director Letitia Long talks about NGA&#x27;s GitHub initiative and the first offering, GeoQ, at the GEOINT Symposium. Her comments start at 40 minutes and 40 seconds from her GEOINT 2014 conference speech. NGA open sources software packages under their GitHub organizational account.
* After the 2019 creation of the United States Space Force, NGA began working with the USSF &quot;to provide geospatial intelligence to support and identify future needs of the service,&quot; establishing a new support team (NST) embedded at USSF headquarters.
* In 2022, NGA aided in rescue and recovery from Hurricane Ian in Florida.
* Since 2022, NGA has provided unclassified imagery capabilities to the Conflict Observatory to capture and analyze evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

==Controversies==
NIMA / NGA has been involved in several controversies.
* India tested a nuclear weapon in 1998 that reportedly took the United States by surprise. Due to budget cuts in defense spending after the end of the Cold War (see Peace dividend), the intelligence community was forced to reevaluate the allocation of its limited resources.
* In 1999, NIMA reportedly provided NATO war planners with incorrect maps that did not reflect that the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade had moved locations, which some have argued was the cause of the accidental NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The Central Intelligence Agency countered this criticism by saying this overstates the importance of the map itself in the analytic process. Maps of urban areas will be out-of-date the day after they are published, but what is important is having accurate databases.
* On Jan. 17, 2013, USS &quot;Guardian&quot;, a mine countermeasures ship, was grounded on the Tubbataha Reef in the southern Philippines. While it was determined that the NGA had provided an inaccurate chart that was off by as much as , the Navy primarily faulted the ship&#x27;s crew, specifically the commanding officer, the executive officer and two junior officers that were standing watch at the time of the grounding, as they had failed to adhere to prudent, safe, and sound navigation principles. The crew relied solely on the inaccurate Digital Nautical Chart (DNC) during the planning and execution of the navigation plan and failed to appropriately cross-reference additional charts and utilize visual cues.
*From 2013 to 2018, NGA designated the latitude and longitude coordinates of a private residence as a default location for Pretoria, South Africa, causing the digital-mapping website MaxMind to set it as the location of over one million IP addresses, which in turn caused people searching for missing phones and other electronics (as well as other people trying to track down IP addresses in Pretoria and police officers attempting to track criminals) to show up at the residence. The issue was eventually resolved following a private investigation and a request to both NGA and MaxMind that the default location be changed.

<text>The Panchatantra (IAST: Pañcatantra, ISO: Pañcatantra, , &quot;Five Treatises&quot;) is an ancient Indian collection of interrelated animal fables in Sanskrit verse and prose, arranged within a frame story. The surviving work is dated to about 300 CE, but the fables are likely much more ancient. The text&#x27;s author is unknown, but it has been attributed to Vishnu Sharma in some recensions and Vasubhaga in others, both of which may be fictitious pen names. It is likely a Hindu text, and based on older oral traditions with &quot;animal fables that are as old as we are able to imagine&quot;.

It is &quot;certainly the most frequently translated literary product of India&quot;, and these stories are among the most widely known in the world. It goes by many names in many cultures. There is a version of &quot;Panchatantra&quot; in nearly every major language of India, and in addition there are 200 versions of the text in more than 50 languages around the world. One version reached Europe in the 11th century. To quote :
The earliest known translation, into a non-Indian language, is in Middle Persian (Pahlavi, 550 CE) by Burzoe. This became the basis for a Syriac translation as Kalilag and Damnag and a translation into Arabic in 750 CE by Persian scholar Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa as Kalīlah wa Dimnah. A New Persian version by Rudaki, from the 9th-10th century CE, became known as &quot;Kalīleh o Demneh&quot;. Rendered in prose by Abu&#x27;l-Ma&#x27;ali Nasrallah Monshi in 1143 CE, this was the basis of Kashefi&#x27;s 15th-century &quot;Anvār-i Suhaylī&quot; (The Lights of Canopus), which in turn was translated into &quot;Humayun-namah&quot; in Turkish. The book is also known as The Fables of Bidpai (or Pilpai in various European languages, Vidyapati in Sanskrit) or &quot;The Morall Philosophie of Doni&quot; (English, 1570). Most European versions of the text are derivative works of the 12th-century Hebrew version of &quot;Panchatantra&quot; by Rabbi Joel. In Germany, its translation in 1480 by has been widely read. Several versions of the text are also found in Indonesia, where it is titled as Tantri Kamandaka, &quot;Tantravakya&quot; or &quot;Candapingala&quot; and consists of 360 fables. In Laos, a version is called Nandaka-prakarana, while in Thailand it has been referred to as Nang Tantrai.

==Author and chronology==
The prelude section of the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; identifies an octogenarian Brahmin named Vishnusharma (IAST: Viṣṇuśarman) as its author. He is stated to be teaching the principles of good government to three princes of Amarasakti. It is unclear, states Patrick Olivelle, a professor of Sanskrit and Indian religions, if Vishnusharma was a real person or himself a literary invention. Some South Indian recensions of the text, as well as Southeast Asian versions of &quot;Panchatantra&quot; attribute the text to Vasubhaga, states Olivelle. Based on the content and mention of the same name in other texts dated to ancient and medieval era centuries, most scholars agree that Vishnusharma is a fictitious name. Olivelle and other scholars state that regardless of who the author was, it is likely &quot;the author was a Hindu, and not a Buddhist, nor Jain&quot;, but it is unlikely that the author was a devotee of Hindu god Vishnu because the text neither expresses any sentiments against other Hindu deities such as Shiva, Indra and others, nor does it avoid invoking them with reverence.

Various locations where the text was composed have been proposed but this has been controversial. Some of the proposed locations include Kashmir, Southwestern or South India. The text&#x27;s original language was likely Sanskrit. Though the text is now known as &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, the title found in old manuscript versions varies regionally, and includes names such as &quot;Tantrakhyayika&quot;, &quot;Panchakhyanaka&quot;, &quot;Panchakhyana&quot; and &quot;Tantropakhyana&quot;. The suffix &quot;akhyayika&quot; and &quot;akhyanaka&quot; mean &quot;little story&quot; or &quot;little story book&quot; in Sanskrit.

The text was translated into Pahlavi in 550 CE, which forms the latest limit of the text&#x27;s existence. The earliest limit is uncertain. It quotes identical verses from &quot;Arthasastra&quot;, which is broadly accepted to have been completed by the early centuries of the common era. According to Olivelle, &quot;the current scholarly consensus places the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; around 300 CE, although we should remind ourselves that this is only an educated guess&quot;. The text quotes from older genre of Indian literature, and legends with anthropomorphic animals are found in more ancient texts dated to the early centuries of the 1st millennium BCE such as the chapter 4.1 of the &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot;. According to Gillian Adams, Panchatantra may be a product of the Vedic period, but its age cannot be ascertained with confidence because &quot;the original Sanskrit version has been lost&quot;.

==Content==
The &quot;Panchatantra&quot; is a series of inter-woven fables, many of which deploy metaphors of anthropomorphized animals with human virtues and vices. Its narrative illustrates, for the benefit of three ignorant princes, the central Hindu principles of &quot;nīti&quot;. While &quot;nīti&quot; is hard to translate, it roughly means prudent worldly conduct, or &quot;the wise conduct of life&quot;.

Apart from a short introduction, it consists of five parts. Each part contains a main story, called the frame story, which in turn contains several embedded stories, as one character narrates a story to another. Often these stories contain further embedded stories. The stories operate like a succession of Russian dolls, one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four deep. Besides the stories, the characters also quote various epigrammatic verses to make their point.

The five books have their own subtitles.
===Book 1: &quot;Mitra-bheda&quot;===

The first treatise features a jackal named Damanaka, as the unemployed minister in a kingdom ruled by a lion. He, along with his moralizing sidekick named Karataka, conspire to break up alliances and friendships of the lion king. A series of fables describe the conspiracies and causes that lead to close and inseparable friends breaking up.

The Book 1 contains over thirty fables, with the version Arthur Ryder translated containing 34: The Loss of Friends, The Wedge-Pulling Monkey, The Jackal and the War-Drum, Merchant Strong-Tooth, Godly and June, The Jackal at the Ram-Fight, The Weaver&#x27;s Wife, How the Crow-Hen Killed the Black Snake, The Heron that Liked Crab-Meat, Numskull and the Rabbit, The Weaver Who Loved a Princess, The Ungrateful Man, Leap and Creep, The Blue Jackal, Passion and the Owl, Ugly&#x27;s Trust Abused, The Lion and the Carpenter, The Plover Who Fought the Ocean, Shell-Neck Slim and Grim, Forethought Readywit and Fatalist, The Duel Between Elephant and Sparrow, The Shrewd Old Gander, The Lion and the Ram, Smart the Jackal, The Monk Who Left His Body Behind, The Girl Who Married a Snake, Poor Blossom, The Unteachable Monkey, Right-Mind and Wrong-Mind, A Remedy Worse than the Disease, The Mice That Ate Iron, The Results of Education, The Sensible Enemy, The Foolish Friend.

It is the longest of the five books, making up roughly 45% of the work&#x27;s length.

===Book 2: &quot;Mitra-samprāpti&quot;===
The second treatise is quite different in structure than the remaining books, states Olivelle, as it does not truly embed fables. It is a collection of adventures of four characters: a crow (scavenger, not a predator, airborne habits), a mouse (tiny, underground habits), a turtle (slow, water habits) and a deer (a grazing animal viewed by other animals as prey, land habits). The overall focus of the book is the reverse of the first book. Its theme is to emphasize the importance of friendships, team work, and alliances. It teaches, &quot;weak animals with very different skills, working together can accomplish what they cannot when they work alone&quot;, according to Olivelle. United through their cooperation and in their mutual support, the fables describe how they are able to outwit all external threats and prosper.

The second book contains ten fables: The Winning of Friends, The Bharunda Birds, Gold&#x27;s Gloom, Mother Shandilee&#x27;s Bargain, Self-defeating Forethought, Mister Duly, Soft, the Weaver, Hang-Ball and Greedy, The Mice That Set Elephant Free, Spot&#x27;s Captivity.

Book 2 makes up about 22% of the total length.

===Book 3: &quot;Kākolūkīyam&quot;===

The third treatise discusses war and peace, presenting through animal characters a moral about the battle of wits being a strategic means to neutralize a vastly superior opponent&#x27;s army. The thesis in this treatise is that a battle of wits is a more potent force than a battle of swords. The choice of animals embeds a metaphor of a war between good versus evil, and light versus darkness. Crows are good, weaker and smaller in number and are creatures of the day (light), while owls are presented as evil, numerous and stronger creatures of the night (darkness). The crow king listens to the witty and wise counsel of Ciramjivin, while the owl king ignores the counsel of Raktaksa. The good crows win.

The fables in the third book, as well as others, do not strictly limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character&#x27;s viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable &quot;The Old Man the Young Wife&quot;, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance so much that she refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.

The third book contains eighteen fables in Ryder translation: Crows and Owls, How the Birds Picked a King, How the Rabbit Fooled the Elephant, The Cat&#x27;s Judgment, The Brahmin&#x27;s Goat, The Snake and the Ants, The Snake Who Paid Cash, The Unsocial Swans, The Self-sacrificing Dove, The Old Man with the Young Wife, The Brahmin, The Thief and the Ghost, The Snake in the Prince&#x27;s Belly, The Gullible Carpenter, Mouse-Maid Made Mouse, The Bird with Golden Dung, The Cave That Talked, The Frog That Rode Snakeback, The Butter-blinded Brahmin.

This is about 26% of the total length.

===Book 4: &quot;Labdhapraṇāśam&quot;===
The book four of the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; is a simpler compilation of ancient moral-filled fables. These, states Olivelle, teach messages such as &quot;a bird in hand is worth two in the bush&quot;. They caution the reader to avoid succumbing to peer pressure and cunning intent wrapped in soothing words. The book is different from the first three, in that the earlier books give positive examples of ethical behavior offering examples and actions &quot;to do&quot;. In contrast, book four presents negative examples with consequences, offering examples and actions &quot;to avoid, to watch out for&quot;.

The fourth book contains thirteen fables in Ryder translation: Loss of Gains, The Monkey and the Crocodile, Handsome and Theodore, Flop-Ear and Dusty, The Potter Militant, The Jackal Who Killed No Elephants, The Ungrateful Wife, King Joy and Secretary Splendor, The Ass in the Tiger-Skin, The Farmer&#x27;s Wife, The Pert Hen-Sparrow, How Supersmart Ate the Elephant, The Dog Who Went Abroad.

Book 4, along with Book 5, is very short. Together the last two books constitute about 7% of the total text.

===Book 5: &quot;Aparīkṣitakārakaṃ&quot;===

Book five of the text is, like book four, a simpler compilation of moral-filled fables. These also present negative examples with consequences, offering examples and actions for the reader to ponder, avoid, and watch out for. The lessons in this last book include &quot;get facts, be patient, don&#x27;t act in haste then regret later&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t build castles in the air&quot;. The book five is also unusual in that almost all its characters are humans, unlike the first four where the characters are predominantly anthropomorphized animals. According to Olivelle, it may be that the text&#x27;s ancient author sought to bring the reader out of the fantasy world of talking and pondering animals into the realities of the human world.

The fifth book contains twelve fables about hasty actions or jumping to conclusions without establishing facts and proper due diligence. In Ryder translation, they are: Ill-considered Action, The Loyal Mongoose, The Four Treasure-Seekers, The Lion-Makers, Hundred-Wit Thousand-Wit and Single-Wit, The Musical Donkey, Slow the Weaver, The Brahman&#x27;s Dream, The Unforgiving Monkey, The Credulous Fiend, The Three-Breasted Princess, The Fiend Who Washed His Feet.

One of the fables in this book is the story of a woman and a mongoose. She leaves her child with a mongoose friend. When she returns, she sees blood on the mongoose&#x27;s mouth, and kills the friend, believing the animal killed her child. The woman discovers her child alive, and learns that the blood on the mongoose mouth came from it biting the snake while defending her child from the snake&#x27;s attack. She regrets having killed the friend because of her hasty action.

==Links with other fables==
The fables of &quot;Panchatantra&quot; are found in numerous world languages. It is also considered partly the origin of European secondary works, such as folk tale motifs found in Boccaccio, La Fontaine and the works of Grimm Brothers. For a while, this had led to the hypothesis that popular worldwide animal-based fables had origins in India and the Middle East. According to Max Muller,

This monocausal hypothesis has now been generally discarded in favor of polygenetic hypothesis which states that fable motifs had independent origins in many ancient human cultures, some of which have common roots and some influenced by co-sharing of fables. The shared fables implied morals that appealed to communities separated by large distances and these fables were therefore retained, transmitted over human generations with local variations. However, many post-medieval era authors explicitly credit their inspirations to texts such as &quot;Bidpai&quot; and &quot;Pilpay, the Indian sage&quot; that are known to be based on the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;.

According to Niklas Bengtsson, even though India being the exclusive original source of animal fables is no longer taken seriously, the ancient classic &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, &quot;which new folklore research continues to illuminate, was certainly the first work ever written down for children, and this in itself means that the Indian influence has been enormous [on fables around the world], not only on the genres of fables and fairy tales, but on those genres as taken up in children&#x27;s literature&quot;. According to Adams and Bottigheimer, the fables of &quot;Panchatantra&quot; are known in at least 38 languages around the world in 112 versions by Jacob&#x27;s old estimate, and its relationship with Mesopotamian and Greek fables is hotly debated in part because the original manuscripts of all three ancient texts have not survived. Olivelle states that there are 200 versions of the text in more than 50 languages around the world, in addition to a version in nearly every major language of India.

Scholars have noted the strong similarity between a few of the stories in &quot;The Panchatantra&quot; and &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;. Examples are &quot;The Ass in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; and &quot;The Ass without Heart and Ears&quot;. &quot;The Broken Pot&quot; is similar to Aesop&#x27;s &quot;The Milkmaid and Her Pail&quot;, &quot;The Gold-Giving Snake&quot; is similar to Aesop&#x27;s &quot;The Man and the Serpent&quot; and &quot;Le Paysan et Dame serpent&quot; by Marie de France (&quot;Fables&quot;) Other well-known stories include &quot;The Tortoise and The Geese&quot; and &quot;The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal&quot;. Similar animal fables are found in most cultures of the world, although some folklorists view India as the prime source. The &quot;Panchatantra&quot; has been a source of the world&#x27;s fable literature.

The French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine acknowledged his indebtedness to the work in the introduction to his Second Fables:
:&quot;This is a second book of fables that I present to the public... I have to acknowledge that the greatest part is inspired from Pilpay, an Indian Sage&quot;.

&quot;The Panchatantra&quot; is the origin also of several stories in &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, &quot;Sindbad&quot;, and of many Western nursery rhymes and ballads.

==Origins and function==
In the Indian tradition, &quot;The Panchatantra&quot; is a . &quot;Nīti&quot; can be roughly translated as &quot;the wise conduct of life&quot; and a &quot;śāstra&quot; is a technical or scientific treatise; thus it is considered a treatise on political science and human conduct. Its literary sources are &quot;the expert tradition of political science and the folk and literary traditions of storytelling&quot;. It draws from the Dharma and Artha &quot;śāstra&quot;s, quoting them extensively. It is also explained that &quot;nīti&quot; &quot;represents an admirable attempt to answer the insistent question how to win the utmost possible joy from life in the world of men&quot; and that &quot;nīti&quot; is &quot;the harmonious development of the powers of man, a life in which security, prosperity, resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so combined to produce joy&quot;.

&quot;The Panchatantra&quot; shares many stories in common with the Buddhist Jataka tales, purportedly told by the historical Buddha before his death around 400 BCE. As the scholar Patrick Olivelle writes, &quot;It is clear that the Buddhists did not invent the stories. [...] It is quite uncertain whether the author of [the Panchatantra] borrowed his stories from the &quot;Jātaka&quot;s or the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, or whether he was tapping into a common treasury of tales, both oral and literary, of ancient India.&quot; Many scholars believe the tales were based on earlier oral folk traditions, which were finally written down, although there is no conclusive evidence. In the early 20th century, W. Norman Brown found that many folk tales in India appeared to be borrowed from literary sources and not vice versa.
An early Western scholar who studied &quot;The Panchatantra&quot; was Dr. Johannes Hertel, who thought the book had a Machiavellian character. Similarly, Edgerton noted that &quot;the so-called &#x27;morals&#x27; of the stories have no bearing on morality; they are unmoral, and often immoral. They glorify shrewdness and practical wisdom, in the affairs of life, and especially of politics, of government.&quot; Other scholars dismiss this assessment as one-sided, and view the stories as teaching , or proper moral conduct. Also:
According to Olivelle, &quot;Indeed, the current scholarly debate regarding the intent and purpose of the &#x27;Pañcatantra&#x27; — whether it supports unscrupulous Machiavellian politics or demands ethical conduct from those holding high office — underscores the rich ambiguity of the text&quot;. Konrad Meisig states that the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; has been incorrectly represented by some as &quot;an entertaining textbook for the education of princes in the Machiavellian rules of &quot;Arthasastra&quot;&quot;, but instead it is a book for the &quot;Little Man&quot; to develop &quot;Niti&quot; (social ethics, prudent behavior, shrewdness) in their pursuit of &quot;Artha&quot;, and a work on social satire. According to Joseph Jacobs, &quot;... if one thinks of it, the very &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; of the Fable is to imply its moral without mentioning it.&quot;

The Panchatantra, states Patrick Olivelle, tells wonderfully a collection of delightful stories with pithy proverbs, ageless and practical wisdom; one of its appeal and success is that it is a complex book that &quot;does not reduce the complexities of human life, government policy, political strategies, and ethical dilemmas into simple solutions; it can and does speak to different readers at different levels.&quot; In the Indian tradition, the work is a Shastra genre of literature, more specifically a &quot;Nitishastra&quot; text.

The text has been a source of studies on political thought in Hinduism, as well as the management of Artha with a debate on virtues and vices.

===Metaphors and layered meanings===
The Sanskrit version of the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; text gives names to the animal characters, but these names are creative with double meanings. The names connote the character observable in nature but also map a human personality that a reader can readily identify. For example, the deer characters are presented as a metaphor for the charming, innocent, peaceful and tranquil personality who is a target for those who seek a prey to exploit, while the crocodile is presented to symbolize dangerous intent hidden beneath a welcoming ambiance (waters of a lotus flower-laden pond). Dozens of different types of wildlife found in India are thus named, and they constitute an array of symbolic characters in the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;. Thus, the names of the animals evoke layered meaning that resonates with the reader, and the same story can be read at different levels.

==Cross-cultural migrations==


The work has gone through many different versions and translations from the sixth century to the present day. The original Indian version was first translated into a foreign language (Pahlavi) by Borzūya in 570 CE, then into Arabic in 750. This Arabic version was translated into several languages, including Syriac, Greek, Persian, Hebrew and Spanish, and thus became the source of versions in European languages, until the English translation by Charles Wilkins of the Sanskrit &quot;Hitopadesha&quot; in 1787.

===Early cross-cultural migrations===
The &quot;Panchatantra&quot; approximated its current literary form within the 4th–6th centuries CE, though originally written around 200 BCE. No Sanskrit texts before 1000 CE have survived. Buddhist monks on pilgrimage to India took the influential Sanskrit text (probably both in oral and literary formats) north to Tibet and China and east to South East Asia. These led to versions in all Southeast Asian countries, including Tibetan, Chinese, Mongolian, Javanese and Lao derivatives.

===How Borzuy brought the work from India===
The &quot;Panchatantra&quot; also migrated into the Middle East, through Iran, during the Sassanid reign of Anoushiravan. Around 550 CE his notable physician Borzuy (Burzuwaih) translated the work from Sanskrit into the Pahlavi (Middle Persian language). He transliterated the main characters as &quot;Karirak ud Damanak&quot;.

According to the story told in the &quot;Shāh Nāma&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Kings&quot;, Persia&#x27;s late 10th-century national epic by Ferdowsi), Borzuy sought his king&#x27;s permission to make a trip to Hindustan in search of a mountain herb he had read about that is &quot;mingled into a compound and, when sprinkled over a corpse, it is immediately restored to life.&quot; He did not find the herb, but was told by a wise sage of &quot;a different interpretation. The herb is the scientist; science is the mountain, everlastingly out of reach of the multitude. The corpse is the man without knowledge, for the uninstructed man is everywhere lifeless. Through knowledge man becomes revivified.&quot;

The sage pointed to the book, and the visiting physician Borzuy translated the work with the help of some Pandits (Brahmins). According to Hans Bakker, Borzuy visited the kingdom of Kannauj in north India during the 6th century in an era of intense exchange between Persian and Indian royal courts, and he secretly translated a copy of the text then sent it to the court of Anoushiravan in Persia, along with other cultural and technical knowledge.

===Kalila wa Demna: Mid. Persian and Arabic versions===

Borzuy&#x27;s translation of the Sanskrit version into Pahlavi arrived in Persia by the 6th century, but this Middle Persian version is now lost. The book had become popular in Sassanid, and was translated into Syriac and Arabic whose copies survive. According to Riedel, &quot;the three preserved New Persian translations originated between the 10th and 12th century&quot;, and are based on the 8th-century Arabic translation by Ibn al-Muqaffa of Borzuy&#x27;s work on &quot;Panchatantra&quot;. It is the 8th-century &quot;Kalila wa Demna&quot; text, states Riedel, that has been the most influential of the known Arabic versions, not only in the Middle East, but also through its translations into Greek, Hebrew and Old Spanish.

The Persian Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; translated the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; (in ) from Middle Persian to Arabic as &quot;Kalīla wa Dimna&quot;. This is considered the first masterpiece of &quot;Arabic literary prose.&quot;

The introduction of the first book of &quot;Kalila wa Demna&quot; is different from &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, in being more elaborate and instead of king and his three sons studying in the Indian version, the Persian version speaks of a merchant and his three sons who had squandered away their father&#x27;s wealth. The Persian version also makes an abrupt switch from the story of the three sons to an injured ox, and thereafter parallels the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;.

The two jackals&#x27; names transmogrified into Kalila and Dimna in the Persian version. Perhaps because the first section constituted most of the work, or because translators could find no simple equivalent in Zoroastrian Pahlavi for the concept expressed by the Sanskrit word &#x27;Panchatantra&#x27;, the jackals&#x27; names, &quot;Kalila and Dimna,&quot; became the generic name for the entire work in classical times.

After the first chapter, Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ inserted a new one, telling of Dimna&#x27;s trial. The jackal is suspected of instigating the death of the bull &quot;Shanzabeh&quot;, a key character in the first chapter. The trial lasts for two days without conclusion, until a tiger and leopard appear to bear witness against Dimna. He is found guilty and put to death.

Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; inserted other additions and interpretations into his 750CE &quot;re-telling&quot; (see Francois de Blois&#x27; Burzōy&#x27;s voyage to India and the origin of the book &quot;Kalīlah wa Dimnah&quot;). The political theorist Jennifer London suggests that he was expressing risky political views in a metaphorical way. (Al-Muqaffa&#x27; was murdered within a few years of completing his manuscript). London has analysed how Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; could have used his version to make &quot;frank political expression&quot; at the &#x27;Abbasid court (see J. London&#x27;s &quot;How To Do Things With Fables: Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;s Frank Speech in Stories from Kalila wa Dimna,&quot; &quot;History of Political Thought&quot; XXIX: 2 (2008)).

===The Arabic classic by Ibn al-Muqaffa===

Borzuy&#x27;s 570 CE Pahlavi translation (&quot;Kalile va Demne&quot;, now lost) was translated into Syriac. Nearly two centuries later, it was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa around 750 CE under the Arabic title, &quot;Kalīla wa Dimna&quot;. After the Arab invasion of Persia (Iran), Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;s version (two languages removed from the pre-Islamic Sanskrit original) emerged as the pivotal surviving text that enriched world literature. Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;s work is considered a model of the finest Arabic prose style, and &quot;is considered the first masterpiece of Arabic literary prose.&quot;

Some scholars believe that Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;s translation of the second section, illustrating the Sanskrit principle of &quot;Mitra Laabha&quot; (Gaining Friends), became the unifying basis for the Brethren of Purity (&quot;Ikwhan al-Safa&quot;) — the anonymous 9th-century CE encyclopedists whose prodigious literary effort, &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Sincerity&quot;, codified Indian, Persian and Greek knowledge. A suggestion made by Goldziher, and later written on by Philip K. Hitti in his &quot;History of the Arabs&quot;, proposes that &quot;The appellation is presumably taken from the story of the ringdove in &quot;Kalilah wa-Dimnah&quot; in which it is related that a group of animals by acting as faithful friends (&quot;ikhwan al-safa&quot;) to one another escaped the snares of the hunter.&quot; This story is mentioned as an exemplum when the Brethren speak of mutual aid in one &quot;risaala&quot; (treatise), a crucial part of their system of ethics.

===Spread to the rest of Europe===
Almost all pre-modern European translations of the Panchatantra arise from this Arabic version. From Arabic it was re-translated into Syriac in the 10th or 11th century, into Greek (as &quot;Stephanites and Ichnelates&quot;) in 1080 by the Jewish Byzantine doctor Simeon Seth, into &#x27;modern&#x27; Persian by Abu&#x27;l-Ma&#x27;ali Nasrallah Munshi in 1121, and in 1252 into Spanish (old Castilian, &quot;Calila e Dimna&quot;).

Perhaps most importantly, it was translated into Hebrew by Rabbi Joel in the 12th century. This Hebrew version was translated into Latin by John of Capua as &quot;Directorium Humanae Vitae&quot;, or &quot;Directory of Human Life&quot;, and printed in 1480, and became the source of most European versions.
A German translation, &quot;Das Buch der Beispiele&quot;, of the Panchatantra was printed in 1483, making this one of the earliest books to be printed by Gutenberg&#x27;s press after the Bible.

The Latin version was translated into Italian by Antonfrancesco Doni in 1552. This translation became the basis for the first English translation, in 1570: Sir Thomas North translated it into Elizabethan English as &quot;The Fables of Bidpai: The Morall Philosophie of Doni&quot; (reprinted by Joseph Jacobs, 1888). La Fontaine published &quot;The Fables of Bidpai&quot; in 1679, based on &quot;the Indian sage Pilpay&quot;.

==Modern era==
It was the Panchatantra that served as the basis for the studies of Theodor Benfey, the pioneer in the field of comparative literature. His efforts began to clear up some confusion surrounding the history of the Panchatantra, culminating in the work of Hertel (, , , ) and . Hertel discovered several recensions in India, in particular the oldest available Sanskrit recension, the &quot;Tantrakhyayika&quot; in Kashmir, and the so-called North Western Family Sanskrit text by the Jain monk Purnabhadra in 1199 CE that blends and rearranges at least three earlier versions. Edgerton undertook a minute study of all texts which seemed &quot;to provide useful evidence on the lost Sanskrit text to which, it must be assumed, they all go back&quot;, and believed he had reconstructed the original Sanskrit Panchatantra; this version is known as the Southern Family text.

Among modern translations, Arthur W. Ryder&#x27;s translation (), translating prose for prose and verse for rhyming verse, remains popular. In the 1990s two English versions of the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; were published, Chandra Rajan&#x27;s translation (like Ryder&#x27;s, based on Purnabhadra&#x27;s recension) by Penguin (1993), and Patrick Olivelle&#x27;s translation (based on Edgerton&#x27;s reconstruction of the ur-text) by Oxford University Press (1997). Olivelle&#x27;s translation was republished in 2006 by the Clay Sanskrit Library.

Recently Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;s historical milieu itself, when composing his masterpiece in Baghdad during the bloody Abbasid overthrow of the Umayyad dynasty, has become the subject (and rather confusingly, also the title) of a gritty Shakespearean drama by the multicultural Kuwaiti playwright Sulayman Al-Bassam. Ibn al-Muqqafa&#x27;s biographical background serves as an illustrative metaphor for today&#x27;s escalating bloodthirstiness in Iraq — once again a historical vortex for clashing civilisations on a multiplicity of levels, including the obvious tribal, religious and political parallels.

The novelist Doris Lessing notes in her introduction to Ramsay Wood&#x27;s 1980 &quot;retelling&quot; of the first two of the five Panchatantra books, that

<text>The Colgate-Palmolive Company, commonly known as Colgate-Palmolive, is an American multinational consumer products company headquartered on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The company specializes in the production, distribution, and provision of household, health care, personal care, and veterinary products.

==History and founding ==

William Colgate, an English immigrant to America and devout Baptist, established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name William Colgate &amp; Company in 1806.

In 1833, he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business&#x27;s sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s, the company began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857, Colgate died and the company was reorganized as Colgate &amp; Company under the management of his similarly devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872, he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap.

In 1873, the company introduced its first Colgate toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars. In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, named Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs. By 1908, they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. Another of William Colgate&#x27;s sons, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).

In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B. J. Johnson Company was making a soap from palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by Burdett J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it in 1917—Palmolive. Around the start of the 20th century, Palmolive was the world&#x27;s best-selling soap.

In June 1928, rumors started that &quot;officials of the Palmolive-Peet Co. are negotiating to purchase the Colgate Co.&quot; privately held by the Colgate family. Peet Brothers Soap Company of Kansas City merged into Palmolive two years before the merger with Colgate. The merger combined the three oldest and largest soap and perfumery companies in the US and was effective July 1, 1928. The combined company was named the &quot;Colgate Palmolive Peet Company&quot;. The combined pre-merger sales in 1927 of the three companies exceeded $100,000,000 (). The newly combined company had seven US manufacturing facilities as well as factories in 14 foreign countries. In 1953, the companies became a joint venture, known as the Colgate-Palmolive Company.

==Competition with P&amp;G==
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), the world&#x27;s largest soap and detergent maker and the maker of Crest toothpaste. P&amp;G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate&#x27;s soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&amp;G added fluoride to its toothpaste Crest &amp; Gleem (The Gleem brand was discontinued by P&amp;G in 2014) Colgate has since re-claimed the #1 sales position. In the beginning of the TV era, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&amp;G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored only two soap operas, &quot;The Doctors&quot; on NBC &amp; ABC&#x27;s &quot; One Life To Live&quot; from the shows debut in July 1968 until ABC bought &quot;One Life To Live&quot; from its creator Agnes Nixon in December 1974. They tried to keep the sponsorship of One Life To Live and gain sponsorship of Nixon&#x27;s newest soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; which ABC begin airing on January 5th of 1970 but ABC wouldn&#x27;t allow it. However, &quot;The Doctors&quot; was sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive for its entire run from April 1963 until its cancellation in December 1982. 

After &quot;The Doctors&quot; cancellation, Colgate-Palmolive never sponsored another show. P&amp;G continued sponsoring several soap operas on all three networks until its last show &quot;As the World Turns&quot; was canceled in September 2010.

George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, transformed the firm into a modern company with major restructuring.

==Recent years==
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of its plan to focus on its higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.

In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom&#x27;s of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US$100 million. Tom&#x27;s of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.

In 2020, Colgate-Palmolive acquired Hello Products LLC, one of the fastest-growing premium oral care brands in the United States, for an undisclosed amount.

Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in three: the United States, India, and Pakistan.

On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient. The company ranked 184th on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue. In 2021, the company ranked 15th on the list of Most Trusted Brands by Morning Consult.

===Educational and community involvement===
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.

The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women&#x27;s Games. The Colgate Women&#x27;s Games is the nation&#x27;s largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn&#x27;s Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.

In addition the Colgate site has all kinds of resources for children including educational tooth brushing songs and animated videos focused on their well known former animated mascot Dr. Rabbit.

===Ethics===
In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new &quot;working for regulatory change&quot; category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing. This relates to the corporation&#x27;s decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement. Other companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.

In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom&#x27;s of Maine. In 2011, the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan&#x27;s impact on health and the environment.

As of January 2024, Ethical Consumer website states that &quot;Our research highlights several ethical issues with Colgate-Palmolive, including its approach to palm oil, supply chain management, climate change, excessive pay, tax, human rights, and animal testing. It scored our worst rating across all of these categories.&quot;

===Environmental record===
Colgate-Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.

As a successor to the Mennen Company, Colgate-Palmolive was reported in 2017 as one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey. Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.

In 2019, BreakFreeFromPlastic cited Colgate-Palmolive as one of the world&#x27;s top ten plastic polluters. Previously, Colgate-Palmolive had committed to 100% recyclability of plastics in packaging across all its product categories by 2025 but made no commitment to reducing the use of virgin plastic in packaging.

A 2021 report by Global Witness, updated in 2022, stated that Colgate-Palmolive had used palm oil suppliers connected to bribery, brutalisation of villagers and child labour in Papua New Guinea.

In 2021, the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) gave Colgate-Palmolive a score of &quot;F&quot; on their &quot;scorecard&quot; keeping track of deforestation and human rights abuses. In August 2021, Colgate-Palmolive publicly disclosed the &quot;forest impact of its palm oil supply chain in the Indonesian province of North Sumatra&quot;, showing the impact on the rainforests and the indigenous people who live there. In November 2023, Colgate-Palmolive received a &quot;D-&quot; on their RAN scorecard.

In relation to climate change, in June 2023, Planet Tracker stated that Colgate-Palmolive &quot;is on a path to missing its approved Science-based Targets emissions by a factor of 7 when optional indirect use emissions are excluded&quot;, it &quot;provides &#x27;no clear strategy&#x27; to mitigate its main source of emissions, namely, upstream Scope 3 activities&quot; and its &quot;climate engagement with its value chain has not resulted in positive results over the last half-decade, with the GhG emissions from key &#x27;targeted&#x27; areas experiencing substantial growth.&quot; Sustainability Beat stated in August 2023 that this puts their profits in jeopardy and risks greenwashing.

In 2024, the website Ethical Consumer gave Colgate-Palmolive the worst possible rating for climate change, plastic use, and palm oil/deforestation. It received their best rating for avoiding toxic chemicals in its products.

===Corporate governance===
As of August 2023, members of the board of directors of Colgate-Palmolive are the following:
*Noel Wallace
*John P. Bilbrey
*Lisa M. Edwards
*C. Martin Harris
*Martina Hund-Mejean
*Kimberly A. Nelson
*Lorrie M. Norrington
*Steve Cahillane
*John T. Cahill
*Stephen Sadove

===Employment diversity===
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the &quot;100 Best Companies for Working Mothers&quot; by &quot;Working Mother&quot; magazine. The 2012 Human Rights Campaign &quot;report card&quot; on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.

However, Ethical Consumer states that the company &quot;published no standards for working hours and wages and no information about the outcomes of supply chain audits. There was no clear mechanism workers could use to make anonymous complaints and raise issues&quot;, and scores badly in their human rights category.

=== Response to Russian Invasion of Ukraine ===
Following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Colgate-Palmolive announced a suspension of imports and sales in Russia, limiting operations to essential health and hygiene products. The company also halted all capital investments, media, advertising, and promotional activities within the country. As of December 2024, Colgate-Palmolive&#x27;s current operational status in Russia remains unspecified.

==Brands==

Colgate now markets a broadly diversified mix of products in the United States and other countries. Major product areas include household and personal care products, food products, health care and industrial supplies, and sports and leisure time equipment.

Notes:

* While detergent brands continue to be manufactured and sold by Colgate in some countries, in the United States they have been sold to another company, Phoenix Brands in 2005. Phoenix Brands would file for bankruptcy in May 2016 and the US rights have been assumed by Fab &amp; Kind Company.

In May 2015, Colgate-Palmolive sold its Australian laundry detergents and pre-wash brands to Henkel for US$245 million (€220 million). Colgate-Palmolive has divested its laundry detergents business in Colombia, which was in turn acquired by Unilever and some Asian countries, which was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble.

** Still being made by Colgate-Palmolive internationally, but no longer available in the U.S.

==Facilities==

In the U.S., the company operates approximately 60 properties, of which 14 are owned. Major U.S. manufacturing and warehousing facilities used by the oral, personal and home care segment of Colgate-Palmolive were located in Morristown, New Jersey (previously the headquarters of the Mennen company prior to their 1991 buyout, and still HQ of the Mennen division) until 2014, when the plant shut down and moved operations to Hodges, South Carolina ; Morristown, Tennessee; and Cambridge, Ohio. The pet nutrition segment has major facilities in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Emporia, Kansas; Topeka, Kansas; and Richmond, Indiana. The primary research center for oral, personal and home care products is located in Piscataway, New Jersey and the primary research center for pet nutrition products is located in Topeka, Kansas.

Overseas, the company operates approximately 280 properties of which 80 are owned in over 70 countries. Major overseas facilities used by the oral, personal and home care segment are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Guatemala, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and elsewhere throughout the world.

Colgate-Palmolive has closed or is in the process of phasing out production at certain facilities under a restructuring program initiated in 2004 and has built new state-of-the-art plants to produce toothpaste in the U.S., Mexico and Poland.

Colgate-Palmolive&#x27;s chief manufacturing plant is located in Burlington Township, New Jersey, producing all of the fragrance and flavor oils for the company&#x27;s facilities around the world.

==Advertising==
The iconic hand on the Palmolive dishwashing soap label belongs to hand model Elizabeth Barbour. The image is an illustration of a photograph taken in 1985 when the Colgate-Palmolive Company updated the image, hiring Barbour, then with the Ford Agency in New York City.

<text>I Have Returned was Ray Stevens&#x27; twenty-second studio album and his second for MCA Records, released in 1985. The pictures on both the front and the back of the album were taken in the Mississippi Sound near Biloxi, Mississippi according to the album credits. The cover depicts Stevens dressed as General Douglas MacArthur from World War II. &quot;The Haircut Song&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of the Blue Cyclone&quot; were released as singles from the album. &quot;Santa Claus Is Watching You&quot; is a re-recording of Stevens&#x27; 1960s pop single and was re-issued as a country single around the time of the album&#x27;s release and was made into a popular music video.

Stevens later re-recorded &quot;The Pirate Song&quot; on his 1991 album &quot;#1 With a Bullet&quot; and re-recorded the song a third time in 2000 for a music video found on &quot;Funniest Video Characters&quot;.

The first track, &quot;Thus Cacked Henrietta&quot;, is a rendition of the popular fanfare portion from Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;, performed in chicken clucks. The rendition by Stevens lasts a little over 1 minute and was his first chicken-clucking performance since 1977&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood,&quot; released under the alias The Henhouse Five Plus Too.

<doc id="235534" wikidata="Q34255" url="?curid=235534" title="Boredom">
<text>In conventional usage, boredom, ennui, or tedium is an emotion characterized by uninterest in one&#x27;s surrounding, often caused by a lack of distractions or occupations. Although, &quot;There is no universally accepted definition of boredom. But whatever it is, researchers argue, it is not simply another name for depression or apathy. It seems to be a specific mental state that people find unpleasant—a lack of stimulation that leaves them craving relief, with a host of behavioral, medical and social consequences.&quot; According to BBC News, boredom &quot;...can be a dangerous and disruptive state of mind that damages your health&quot;; yet research &quot;...suggest[s] that without boredom we couldn&#x27;t achieve our creative feats.&quot;

In &quot;Experience Without Qualities: Boredom and Modernity&quot;, Elizabeth Goodstein traces the modern discourse on boredom through literary, philosophical, and sociological texts to find that as &quot;a discursively articulated phenomenon...boredom is at once objective and subjective, emotion and intellectualization—not just a response to the modern world, but also a historically constituted strategy for coping with its discontents.&quot; In both conceptions, boredom has to do fundamentally with an experience of time—such as experiencing the slowness of time—and problems of meaning.

==Etymology and terminology==
The expression &quot;to be a bore&quot; had been used in print in the sense of &quot;to be tiresome or dull&quot; since 1768 at the latest. The expression &quot;boredom&quot; means &quot;state of being bored,&quot; 1852, from bore (v.1) + -dom. It also has been employed in a sense &quot;bores as a class&quot; (1883) and &quot;practice of being a bore&quot; (1864, a sense properly belonging to boreism, 1833). The word &quot;bore&quot; as a noun meaning a &quot;thing which causes ennui or annoyance&quot; is attested to since 1778; &quot;of persons by 1812&quot;. The noun &quot;bore&quot; comes from the verb &quot;bore&quot;, which had the meaning &quot;[to] be tiresome or dull&quot; first attested [in] 1768, a vogue word –81 according to Grose (1785); possibly a figurative extension of &quot;to move forward slowly and persistently, as a [hole-] boring tool does.&quot; A popular misconception is that Charles Dickens coined the term &quot;boredom&quot; in his work &quot;Bleak House&quot;, published in 1853. The word, however, has been attested since at least 1829 in an issue of the publication &quot;The Albion&quot;.

The French term for boredom, &quot;ennui&quot;, is sometimes used in English as well, at least since 1778. The term &quot;ennui&quot; was first used &quot;as a French word in English;&quot; in the 1660s and it was &quot;nativized by 1758&quot;. The term &quot;ennui&quot; comes &quot;from French &quot;ennui&quot;, from Old French &quot;enui&quot; &quot;annoyance&quot; (13c.), [a] back-formation from enoiier, anuier. &quot;The German word for &quot;boredom&quot; is &quot;&quot;, a compound made of &quot;lange&quot; &quot;long&quot; and &quot;Weile&quot; &quot;while&quot;, which is in line with the common perception that when one is bored, time passes &quot;tortuously&quot; slowly.

==Psychology==

Different scholars use different definitions of &quot;boredom&quot;, which complicates research. Boredom has been defined by Cynthia D. Fisher in terms of its main central psychological processes: &quot;an unpleasant, transient affective state in which the individual feels a pervasive lack of interest and difficulty concentrating on the current activity.&quot; Mark Leary et al. describe boredom as &quot;an affective experience associated with cognitive attentional processes.&quot; Robert Plutchik characterized boredom as a mild form of disgust. In positive psychology, boredom is described as a response to a moderate challenge for which the subject has more than enough skill.

There are three types of boredom, all of which involve problems of engagement of attention. These include times when humans are prevented from engaging in wanted activity, when humans are forced to engage in unwanted activity, or when people are simply unable for some other reason to maintain engagement in an activity. Boredom proneness is a tendency to experience boredom of all types. This is typically assessed by the Boredom Proneness Scale. Recent research has found that boredom proneness is clearly and consistently associated with failures of attention. Boredom and its proneness are both theoretically and empirically linked to depression and similar symptoms. Nonetheless, boredom proneness has been found to be as strongly correlated with attentional lapses as with depression. Although boredom is often viewed as a trivial and mild irritant, proneness to boredom has been linked to a very diverse range of possible psychological, physical, educational, and social problems.

Absent-mindedness is where a person shows inattentive or forgetful behaviour. Absent-mindedness is a mental condition in which the subject experiences low levels of attention and frequent distraction. Absent-mindedness is not a diagnosed condition, but rather a symptom of boredom and sleepiness which people experience in their daily lives. People who are absent-minded tend to show signs of memory lapse and weak recollection of recently occurring events. This can usually be a result of a variety of other conditions often diagnosed by clinicians such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression. In addition to absent-mindedness leading to an array of consequences affecting daily life, it can also have more severe, long-term problems.

==Physical health==
Lethargy is a state of tiredness, weariness, fatigue, or lack of energy. It can be accompanied by depression, decreased motivation, or apathy. Lethargy can be a normal response to boredom, inadequate sleep, overexertion, overworking, stress, lack of exercise, or a symptom of a disorder. When part of a normal response, lethargy often resolves with rest, adequate sleep, decreased stress, and good nutrition.

==Philosophy==
Boredom is a condition characterized by perception of one&#x27;s environment as dull, tedious, and lacking in stimulation. This can result from leisure and a lack of aesthetic interests. Labor and art may be alienated and passive, or immersed in tedium. There is an inherent anxiety in boredom; people will expend considerable effort to prevent or remedy it, yet in many circumstances, it is accepted as suffering to be endured. Common passive ways to escape boredom are to sleep or to think creative thoughts (daydream). Typical active solutions consist in an intentional activity of some sort, often something new, as familiarity and lead to the tedious.

During the , the French term for the end of the 19th century in the West, some of the cultural hallmarks included &quot;ennui&quot;, cynicism, pessimism, and &quot;...a widespread belief that civilization leads to decadence.&quot;

Boredom also plays a role in existentialist thought. Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement. Like Pascal, they were interested in people&#x27;s quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom. Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Either/Or&quot; describes the rotation method, a method used by higher-level aesthetes in order to avoid boredom. The method is an essential hedonistic aspect of the aesthetic way of life. For the aesthete, one constantly changes what one is doing in order to maximize the enjoyment and pleasure derived from each activity.

In contexts where one is confined, spatially or otherwise, boredom may be met with various religious activities, not because religion would want to associate itself with tedium, but rather, partly because boredom may be taken as the essential human condition, to which God, wisdom, or morality are the ultimate answers. Many philosophers, like Arthur Schopenhauer, espouse this view. This view of religiosity among boredom does affect how often people are bored. People who had a higher religiosity while performing boring tasks reported less boredom than people of less religiosity. People performing the meaningless task had to search less for meaning.

Martin Heidegger wrote about boredom in two texts available in English, in the 1929/30 semester lecture course &quot;The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics&quot;, and again in the essay &quot;What is Metaphysics?&quot; published in the same year. In the lecture, Heidegger included about 100 pages on boredom, probably the most extensive philosophical treatment ever of the subject. He focused on waiting at railway stations in particular as a major context of boredom. Søren Kierkegaard remarks in &quot;Either/Or&quot; that &quot;patience cannot be depicted&quot; visually, since there is a sense that any immediate moment of life may be fundamentally tedious.

Blaise Pascal in the &quot;Pensées&quot; discusses the human condition in saying &quot;we seek rest in a struggle against some obstacles. And when we have overcome these, rest proves unbearable because of the boredom it produces&quot;, and later states that &quot;only an infinite and immutable object—that is, God himself—can fill this infinite abyss.&quot;

Without stimulus or focus, the individual is confronted with nothingness, the meaninglessness of existence, and experiences existential anxiety. Heidegger states this idea as follows: &quot;Profound boredom, drifting here and there in the abysses of our existence like a muffling fog, removes all things and men and oneself along with it into a remarkable indifference. This boredom reveals being as a whole.&quot; Schopenhauer used the existence of boredom in an attempt to prove the vanity of human existence, stating, &quot;...for if life, in the desire for which our essence and existence consists, possessed in itself a positive value and real content, there would be no such thing as boredom: mere existence would fulfil and satisfy us.&quot;

Erich Fromm and other thinkers of critical theory speak of boredom as a common psychological response to industrial society, where people are required to engage in alienated labor. According to Fromm, boredom is &quot;perhaps the most important source of aggression and destructiveness today.&quot; For Fromm, the search for thrills and novelty that characterizes consumer culture are not solutions to boredom, but mere distractions from boredom which, he argues, continues unconsciously. Above and beyond taste and character, the universal case of boredom consists in any instance of &quot;waiting&quot;, as Heidegger noted, such as in line, for someone else to arrive or finish a task, or while one is travelling somewhere. The automobile requires fast reflexes, making its operator busy and hence, perhaps for other reasons as well, making the ride more tedious despite being over sooner.

In some Nguni languages such as Zulu, boredom and loneliness are represented by the same word (isizungu). This adds a new dimension to the oft-quoted definition of ubuntu: &quot;A person is a person through other people&quot;.

==Causes and effects==
Although it has not been widely studied, research on boredom suggests that boredom is a major factor impacting diverse areas of a person&#x27;s life. People ranked low on a boredom-proneness scale were found to have better performance in a wide variety of aspects of their lives, including career, education, and autonomy. Boredom can be a symptom of clinical depression. Boredom can be a form of learned helplessness, a phenomenon closely related to depression. Some philosophies of parenting propose that if children are raised in an environment devoid of stimuli, and are not allowed or encouraged to interact with their environment, they will fail to develop the mental capacities to do so.

In a learning environment, a common cause of boredom is lack of understanding; for instance, if one is not following or connecting to the material in a class or lecture, it will usually seem boring. However, the opposite can also be true; something that is too easily understood, simple or transparent, can also be boring. Boredom is often inversely related to learning, and in school it may be a sign that a student is not challenged enough, or too challenged. An activity that is predictable to the students is likely to bore them.

A 1989 study indicated that an individual&#x27;s impression of boredom may be influenced by the individual&#x27;s degree of attention, as a higher acoustic level of distraction from the environment correlated with higher reportings of boredom. Boredom has been studied as being related to drug abuse among teens. Boredom has been proposed as a cause of pathological gambling behavior. A study found results consistent with the hypothesis that pathological gamblers seek stimulation to avoid states of boredom and depression. It has been suggested that boredom has an evolutionary basis that encourages humans to seek out new challenges. It may influence human learning and ingenuity.

Some recent studies have suggested that boredom may have some positive effects. A low-stimulus environment may lead to increased creativity and may set the stage for a &quot;eureka moment&quot;.

==In the workplace==
Boreout is a management theory that posits that lack of work, boredom, and consequent lack of satisfaction are a common malaise affecting individuals working in modern organizations, especially in office-based white collar jobs. This theory was first expounded in 2007 in &quot;Diagnose Boreout&quot;, a book by Peter Werder and Philippe Rothlin, two Swiss business consultants. They claim the absence of meaningful tasks, rather than the presence of stress, is many workers&#x27; chief problem.

A &quot;banishment room&quot; (also known as a &quot;chasing-out-room&quot; and a &quot;boredom room&quot;) is a modern employee exit management strategy whereby employees are transferred to a department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened enough to quit. Since the resignation is voluntary, the employee would not be eligible for certain benefits. The legality and ethics of the practice is questionable and may be construed as constructive dismissal by the courts in some regions.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Meh&quot; is an interjection used as an expression of indifference or boredom. It may also mean &quot;be it as it may&quot;. It is often regarded as a verbal shrug of the shoulders. The use of the term &quot;meh&quot; shows that the speaker is apathetic, uninterested, or indifferent to the question or subject at hand. It is occasionally used as an adjective, meaning something is mediocre or unremarkable.

===Superfluous man===

The superfluous man (, ) is an 1840s and 1850s Russian literary concept derived from the Byronic hero. It refers to an individual, perhaps talented and capable, who does not fit into social norms. In most cases, this person is born into wealth and privilege. Typical characteristics are disregard for social values, cynicism, and existential boredom; typical behaviors are gambling, drinking, smoking, sexual intrigues, and duels. He is often unempathetic and carelessly distresses others with his actions.

===Existentialist fiction===
The bored antihero became prominent in early 20th century existentialist works such as Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; (1915), Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s (1938), and Albert Camus&#x27; (1942). The protagonist in these works is an indecisive central character who drifts through his life and is marked by ennui, angst, and alienation.

===Grunge lit===
Grunge lit is an Australian literary genre of fictional or semi-autobiographical writing in the early 1990s about young adults living in an &quot;inner cit[y]&quot; &quot;...world of disintegrating futures where the only relief from...boredom was through a nihilistic pursuit of sex, violence, drugs and alcohol&quot;. Often the central characters are disfranchised, lacking drive and determination beyond the desire to satisfy their basic needs. It was typically written by &quot;new, young authors&quot; who examined &quot;gritty, dirty, real existences&quot; of everyday characters. It has been described as both a sub-set of dirty realism and an offshoot of Generation X literature. Stuart Glover states that the term &quot;grunge lit&quot; takes the term &quot;grunge&quot; from the &quot;late 80s and early 90s...Seattle [grunge] bands&quot;. Glover states that the term &quot;grunge lit&quot; was mainly a marketing term used by publishing companies; he states that most of the authors who have been categorized as &quot;grunge lit&quot; writers reject the label.

<doc id="235536" wikidata="Q1619960" url="?curid=235536" title="Bill (weapon)">
<text>A bill is a class of agricultural implement used for trimming tree limbs, which was often repurposed for use as an infantry polearm. In English, the term &#x27;Italian bill&#x27; is applied to the similar roncone or roncola, but the Italian version tended to have a long thrusting spike in addition to the cutting blade. 

The English distinguished among several varieties of bill, including the black, brown and forest bills, but the differences between them are currently not fully understood. Bills were adapted to military use through addition of various projecting blades. Other variants include the bill hook and bill-guisarme.

==Disambiguation==
The bill is similar in size, function and appearance to the halberd, and might be said to represent convergent evolution to fill a common niche: a pole-arm with a point to thrust with, a hook to drag with, and a spike/axe to cut with. The bill should not be conflated with a war-scythe, another pole-arm adapted from an agricultural implement, the scythe. 

Bills have been found in Frankish graves from the Merovingian period.

George Silver, writing in 1599, stated that the black bill should be long, while the forest bill should be .

During the early 16th century when most European states were adopting the pike and arquebus, the English preferred to stick with the combination of bill and English longbow. Even in the Tudor period, bills were still common with levies sent to fight the Scots. The Battle of Flodden in 1513 was a classic match between continental-style pike formations (Scots) and billmen (English). When the English army fought in the Italian War of 1542–1546, the bill was still the main polearm of the English.

The English increasingly transitioned to pike and shot formations from the mid 16th century, but kept the billhook in use in the same capacity as other armies used greatswords and halberds. In 1588, the English Trained Bands consisted of 36% arquebusiers, 6% musketeers, 16% bowmen, 26% pikemen, and 16% billmen. Lansdowne MS 56, attributed to Lord Burghley, states that ideally infantry formations should consist of 50% shot, 30% pikes, and 20% bills. 

Along with the pike, the bill is mentioned as being one of the main weapons of the Irish rebels in Ulster during the 1798 rebellion.

Although obsolete as a military weapon by the 17th century, bills were sent (along with other obsolete arms and armour) to the New World with English colonists to provide defence against Native Americans and Spanish military expeditions. Examples of bills have been excavated at the site of Jamestown, Virginia.

== Variants ==

The shorthanded bills were used by the army of historic India as well, mainly by infantrymen of Bengal. 

An agricultural version, commonly known as either a brush-axe, bush-axe, or brush-hook, is readily available in rural hardware and farm-supply stores in the United States today, and is available in the United Kingdom as a &quot;long bill&quot;. It has a handle, and a head. It is useful for clearing undergrowth and unwanted hedgerows. Both the concave and convex edges may be sharpened edges, but spear-points and back-hooks are not available. Expertly used, the brush-axe can fell a tree with a single blow.

In Brazil, the bill (&quot;foice&quot;) is a very common tool in rural areas as tool and sometimes as a self-defence weapon.

<text>George Hendrik Breitner (12 September 1857 – 5 June 1923) was a Dutch painter and photographer. An important figure in Amsterdam Impressionism, he is noted especially for his paintings of street scenes and harbours in a realistic style. He painted en plein air, and became interested in photography as a means of documenting street life and atmospheric effects – rainy weather in particular – as reference materials for his paintings.

==Biography==
George Hendrik Breitner was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands. 
From 1876 to 1880 he attended the Art Academy in The Hague where his extraordinary talent was rewarded on various occasions. From October 1878 till April 1879 he worked as an art teacher at the Leiden academy Ars Aemula Naturae. In 1880 he was expelled from the Art Academy of The Hague for misconduct, because he had destroyed the regulations-board. In the same year he lived at landscapist Willem Maris&#x27;s place at Loosduinen and was accepted as a member of Pulchri Studio, an important artist&#x27;s society in The Hague. Later, he distanced himself from the Hague School and today he is generally regarded as an Amsterdam Impressionist.

During 1880–1881 he worked at the famous Panorama Mesdag together with Hendrik Mesdag, S. Mesdag-van Houten, Theophile de Bock and Barend Blommers. In 1882 he met and worked together with Vincent van Gogh, with whom he often went sketching in the poorer areas of The Hague. Breitner preferred working-class models: labourers, servant girls and people from the lower class districts. Interest in the lot of the common people, which many artists felt in that period, was nurtured by the social conscience of French writers such as Émile Zola.

He was associated with the Dutch literary group known as the &quot;Tachtigers&quot; (English translation: &quot;Eighty-ers&quot;). This was a group that championed impressionism and naturalism against romanticism, influencing other painters such as Isaac Israëls, Willem Witsen, and poets like Willem Kloos.

In 1886, he entered the Rijksakademie of Amsterdam, but soon it became clear that Breitner was far beyond the level of education offered there.

Breitner saw himself as &quot;le peintre du peuple&quot;, the people&#x27;s painter. He was the painter of city views par excellence: wooden foundation piles by the harbour, demolition work and construction sites in the old centre, horse trams on the Dam, or canals in the rain. With his nervous brush strokes, he captured the dynamic street life. By 1890, cameras were affordable, and Breitner had a much better instrument to satisfy his ambitions. He became very interested in capturing movement and illumination in the city, and became a master in doing this. It is not impossible that Breitner&#x27;s preference for cloudy weather conditions and a greyish and brownish palette resulted from certain limitations of the photographic material.

Breitner also painted female nudes, but just like Rembrandt he was criticized because his nudes were painted too realistically and did not resemble the common ideal of beauty. In his own time Breitner&#x27;s paintings were admired by artists and art lovers, but often despised by the Dutch art critics for their raw and realistic nature.

By the turn of the century Breitner was a famous painter in the Netherlands, as demonstrated by a highly successful retrospective exhibition at Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam (1901). Breitner travelled frequently in the last decades of his life, visiting Paris, London, and Berlin, among other cities, and continued to take photographs. In 1909 he went to the United States as a member of the jury for the Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh.

Although Breitner exhibited abroad early on, his fame never crossed the borders of the Netherlands. At the time foreign interest was more for anecdotal and picturesque works; the typical &quot;Dutchness&quot; of the Hague School. As time went by critics lost interest in Breitner. The younger generation regarded impressionism as too superficial. They aspired to a more elevated and spiritual form of art, but Breitner did not allow himself to be influenced by these new artistic trends. Around 1905–1910 pointillism as practised by Jan Sluyters, Piet Mondrian and Leo Gestel was flourishing. Between 1911 and 1914 all the latest art movements arrived in the Netherlands one after another including cubism, futurism and expressionism. Breitner&#x27;s role as contemporary historical painter was finished.

Breitner had only two pupils, Kees Maks (1876–1967) and Marie Henrie Mackenzie (1878–1961).

He died on 5 June 1923 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

=== Breitner and van Gogh ===



In the early months of 1882, Breitner came into contact with Vincent van Gogh. Van Gogh appears to have been introduced to him by his brother Theo, and the pair sketched together in the working-class districts of The Hague. Breitner was motivated to do so because he regarded himself as a painter of the common folk. Van Gogh, initially at any rate, was more intent on recruiting models. It is likely that Breitner introduced van Gogh to the novels of Émile Zola and the cause of social realism.

Breitner was hospitalised in April. Van Gogh visited him in hospital, but Breitner did not return the visits when van Gogh himself was hospitalised two months later, and they did not meet again until the following July when van Gogh was on the verge of leaving The Hague and Breitner spending more time in Rotterdam than the Hague. At that time van Gogh gave Theo a less than flattering account of Breitner&#x27;s paintings as resembling mouldy wallpaper, although he did say he thought he would be all right in the end. For his part, there is no evidence that Breitner saw anything notable in van Gogh&#x27;s work. He later reminisced that sketching with van Gogh was problematic because, whereas Breitner sketched discreetly in a notebook, van Gogh came laden with apparatus and attracted hostile attention.

Two years after van Gogh&#x27;s death, Breitner wrote that he did not like van Gogh&#x27;s paintings: &quot;I can’t help it, but to me it seems like art for Eskimos, I cannot enjoy it. I honestly find it coarse and distasteful, without any distinction, and what’s more, he has stolen it all from Millet and others.&quot;

==Legacy==

Breitner introduced a social realism to the Netherlands that created shock waves similar to that of Courbet and Manet&#x27;s in France. In his early years, the corn merchant A.P. van Stolk, who was interested in art, played an influential role. He financially supported the young painter from 1877 to 1883, but his conservative taste clashed with Breitner&#x27;s particular style.

The discovery in 1996 of a large collection of photographic prints and negatives made clear that Breitner was also a talented photographer of street life in the city. Sometimes he made various pictures of the same subject, from different perspectives or in different weather conditions. Photos sometimes formed the immediate example for a particular painting, for instance the girls in kimono. On other occasions, Breitner used photography for general reference, to capture an atmosphere, a light effect or the weather in the city at a particular moment. In 2021, a photograph by Breitner (&quot;Hangboogstraat 23 in Amsterdam&quot;) was included in the Netherlands Photo Museum&#x27;s permanent exhibition &quot;Gallery of Honour of Dutch Photography&quot;, consisting of 99 photographs.

Breitner is remembered in a Dutch figure of speech: when the streets are grey and rainy, people of Amsterdam whisper grimly &quot;Echt Breitnerweer&quot; (Typical Breitnerweather).

== Art market ==
&quot;Girl in a Red Kimono&quot; realized €582,450 at a Christie&#x27;s Amsterdam sale in October 2003. The purchaser was Robert Noortman. The model for the painting was Geesje Kwak, the subject of a series of seven paintings and studies by Breitner of a girl dressed in a red or white kimono lying on a bed or standing before a mirror. The painting is considered a high point of Dutch &quot;Japonisme&quot;.

In April 2005, &quot;Rokin with the Nieuwezijdskapel, Amsterdam&quot; realized €415,200 at Christie&#x27;s, Amsterdam.

&quot;Gezicht op Keizersgracht hoek Reguliersgracht&quot; (&quot;An Elegant Lady Strolling Along a Canal in Amsterdam)&quot; realized €760,250 at an October 2007 Christie&#x27;s Amsterdam sale. The scene is a noted beauty spot in Amsterdam and the palette rather brighter than Breitner&#x27;s norm, although still muted by comparison with his French counterparts.

== Influences ==
Breitner Academie (2016–present). From 2016, the Amsterdam Academy of Fine Arts is housed at Overhoeksplein 1-2, next to the EYE Film Institute film museum and Tolhuistuin. The academy was renamed the Breitner Academie, named after the Amsterdam artist George Hendrik Breitner.

<doc id="235539" wikidata="Q332285" url="?curid=235539" title="Canopic jar">
<text>Canopic jars are containers that were used by the ancient Egyptians during the mummification process, to store and preserve the viscera of their soul for the afterlife. The earliest and most common versions were made from stone, but later styles were carved from wood. The ritual use of the jars dates as far back as the Old Kingdom and stayed in practice until the Late Period or the Ptolemaic Period, by which time the viscera were simply wrapped and placed with the body. Canopic jars of the Old Kingdom were rarely inscribed and had a plain lid, but by the Middle Kingdom inscriptions became more usual, and the lids were often in the form of human heads. By the Nineteenth Dynasty each of the four lids depicted one of the four sons of Horus, acting as guardians for the respective organs in each jar.

Cinerary jars with a head-shaped lid, also called &quot;Canopic&quot;, were used by the Etruscan civilization.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;canopic&quot; reflects the mistaken association by early Egyptologists with the Greek legend of Canopus – the boat captain of Menelaus on the voyage to Troy – &quot;who was buried at Canopus in the Delta where he was worshipped in the form of a jar&quot;. In alternative versions, the name derives from the location Canopus (now Abukir) in the western Nile Delta near Alexandria, where human-headed jars were worshipped as personifications of the god Osiris.

== Design ==

Canopic jars are v-shaped vessels that are hollowed out in the middle and topped with either plain or iconographic stoppers. They ranged in heights from about , including the lid, and in diameters of anywhere from . The most common materials used to make the jars include wood, limestone, faience, and clay, and the design was occasionally accompanied by painted on facial features, names of the deceased or the gods, and/or burial spells. Early canopic jars were placed inside a canopic chest and buried in tombs together with the sarcophagus of the dead. Later, they were sometimes arranged in rows beneath the bier, or at the four corners of the chamber.

The original style of the jars from the Old Kingdom included a plain, round stopper, while the more typical stoppers in the shape of human heads were not seen until the First Intermediate Period. The human heads were the iconized representations of the Sons of Horus in their human form and were the predominant styling for the jars through ancient Egypt until the New Kingdom in Nineteenth Dynasty, in which the style transitioned to the more well-known depiction of the animal heads. Many higher-quality sets from this period were crafted from minerals such as alabaster, aragonite, calcareous stone, and blue or green glazed porcelain.

== Purpose ==
The practice of evisceration began early in the Old Kingdom, but the specific use of the jars as storage for the organs was not well established until the First Intermediate Period. At the time of mummification, the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines were removed from the corpse to prevent them from eating away at the rest of the body. Each organ was salted in natron and placed individually into one of the four canopic jars. (There was no jar for the heart: the Egyptians believed it to be the seat of the soul, and so it was left inside the body.)

Canopic jars from the Old Kingdom were found empty and damaged, even in undisturbed tombs, suggesting that they were part of the burial ritual rather than being used to hold the organs. The Third Intermediate Period and beyond adopted a similar practice, placing much smaller dummy jars in the tombs without including the organs. Improved embalming techniques allowed the viscera to remain in the body; the traditional jars remained a feature of tombs, but were no longer hollowed out for storing the organs.

==Religious significance==

Each of Horus&#x27;s sons were responsible for protecting a particular organ, was himself protected by a companion goddess, and represented a cardinal direction:
* Hapi: the baboon-headed god representing the North was protected by the goddess Nephthys and was assigned to the lungs;
* Duamutef: the jackal-headed god representing the East was protected by the goddess Neith and was assigned to the stomach;
* Imseti: the human-headed god representing the South was protected by the goddess Isis and was assigned to the liver;
* Qebehsenuef: the falcon-headed god representing the West was protected by the goddess Serket and was assigned to the intestines.

== Additional information ==
In 2020, excavations at Saqqara showed that a woman called Didibastet, whose 2,600-year-old undisturbed tomb was discovered behind a stone wall, was entombed with six canopic jars instead of the traditional four. A CT scan revealed that the jars contain human tissue, suggesting that Didibastet&#x27;s mummification was possibly the result of a specific request.

==Etruscan canopic jars==

Since the Villanovan era, the ashes of some high-ranking Etruscan deceased were placed into urns which, almost as if to evoke physical integrity after cremation, were covered with a helmet. This also helped distinguish one burial from another.

During the 7th century BCE, this practice developed in Chiusi and its surrounding territory with the creation of ossuaries made from a globular bronze vase, placed on a throne and in front of a symbolic table (&quot;trapeza&quot;), as if to depict the deceased during a banquet, surrounded by symbols of power and social status. The earliest examples had a hemispherical dome-shaped lid, known as a &quot;champagne cork&quot; type, which in some cases featured rudimentary facial features.

Towards the end of the century, this representation became even more explicit, with the lid taking the shape of a face and, in more advanced examples, evolving into a fully sculpted head, sometimes featuring holes where hair, beards, and earrings could be inserted. Etruscologists later referred to this form as &quot;canopic jars&quot; due to its resemblance to Egyptian ones, though its function was entirely different—not for holding viscera but for containing cremated remains. This burial style remained in use until the 6th century BCE.

In the most elaborate examples, the funerary urns included additional anthropomorphic elements such as arms (sometimes attached separately) and breasts in the case of female canopic urns. However, it would be inaccurate to consider them true portraits, as their physical features were fairly standardized and reduced to a few typologies. Their purpose was to provide a general identification of the deceased rather than a faithful reproduction of their appearance.

<doc id="235543" wikidata="Q2858662" url="?curid=235543" title="Appeal to ridicule">
<text>Appeal to ridicule (also called appeal to mockery, ad absurdo, or the horse laugh) is an informal fallacy which presents an opponent&#x27;s argument as absurd, ridiculous, or humorous, and therefore not worthy of serious consideration.

== Description ==
Appeal to ridicule is often found in the form of comparing a multi-layered circumstance or argument to a laughably commonplace event or to another irrelevant thing based on comedic timing, or wordplay. This is a rhetorical tactic that mocks an opponent&#x27;s argument or position, attempting to inspire a strong emotional reaction (making it a type of appeal to emotion) in the audience and to highlight any counter-intuitive aspects of that argument, making it appear foolish and contrary to common sense. This is typically done by mocking the argument&#x27;s representative foundation in an uncharitable and oversimplified way. The person using the tactic is often sarcastic in their argument.

== Examples ==
This dialogue presents an example of appeal to ridicule:

<text>The Alberni Quartet is a British string quartet, whose members have included:

* 1st violin Dennis Simons, then Howard Davis, currently Karin Leishman
* 2nd violin Howard Davis, then John Knight, then Peter Pople, currently Victoria Sayles
* Viola John White, then Berian Evans, then Roger Best, currently Matthew Souter
* Cello Gregory Baron, then David Smith, currently Richard May

The quartet was founded in 1962 by four students of the Royal Academy of Music (Dennis Simons, Howard Davis, John White, and Gregory Baron). It was initially named the Simons Quartet, after its first violinist, and later renamed Alberni (the name of Dennis Simons&#x27; birthplace in Canada). From 1968 Davis became the 1st violinist, with Peter Pople, Roger Best, and David Smith. They were based in Harlow, Essex where they became established in the 1960s as the town&#x27;s &quot;quartet in residence&quot;, and by the mid-1970s had become world-renowned. Their debut in the Carnegie Hall was well received in the New York Times, and they received positive reviews of their recordings of Schumann&#x27;s piano quintet, Schubert&#x27;s string quintet and Brahms&#x27; string sextets numbers one and two.

As well as performing a wide range of the classical string quartet repertoire from Haydn and Mozart to Bartók and Benjamin Britten, they performed new works written for them including Richard Stoker&#x27;s first string quartet at the Buxton Festival in February 1962 and again at the SPNM, 4 St James&#x27;s Square, London, in March 1963, Alan Rawsthorne&#x27;s third string quartet written for the 1965 Harlow Music Festival, and Nicholas Maw&#x27;s first string quartet.

Benjamin Britten coached them in his own first and second string quartets (they have recorded all three of his works in the genre), and entrusted the first British performances of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s ninth and tenth quartets (whose scores he had acquired from the composer) to them.

The Alberni were the first Western quartet to visit China (1987).

They were the resident quartet at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama from 1981 to 1988.

In 1993, at the Presteigne Festival, the quartet gave the first complete performance of Adrian Williams&#x27; Third String Quartet.

The Alberni Quartet are now based in South-West England, and have been Quartet-in-Residence at Cedars Hall, Wells, and Artists-in-Residence at the 2018 Two Moors Festival.

<text>The Allegri Quartet is a British string quartet that was founded in 1953 by violinist Eli Goren. The other original members were second violinist James Barton, violist Patrick Ireland, and cellist William Pleeth. It is Britain&#x27;s longest-running chamber music ensemble.

A commitment to refreshing the chamber repertoire had led the Allegri Quartet to give more than 60 world premières since 1964, including specially commissioned pieces by leading composers such as James MacMillan, Jonathan Harvey and Colin Matthews.

== Reception ==
A 2001 review in the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; said that the Allegri Quartet &quot;judged [Berg&#x27;s Lyric Suite] to perfection, allowing the important inner lines to merge with unusual clarity and plumbing the score&#x27;s complex textures in a straightforward and unfussy way, firmly resisting any temptation to milk the charged harmonies or wallow in the passages of brooding melancholy.&quot;

In comparing and contrasting the Allegri Quartet to the now-defunct Amadeus, Bayan Northcott wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2004 that &quot;where the older group cultivated a tremulous sweetness of sound, the Allegri always went for a plainer, perhaps more deeply penetrating manner – not to say, more adventurous programming.&quot;

<doc id="235548" wikidata="Q28578" url="?curid=235548" title="Appetite">
<text>Appetite is the desire to eat food items, usually due to hunger. Appealing foods can stimulate appetite even when hunger is absent, although appetite can be greatly reduced by satiety. Appetite exists in all higher life-forms, and serves to regulate adequate energy intake to maintain metabolic needs. It is regulated by a close interplay between the digestive tract, adipose tissue and the brain. Appetite has a relationship with every individual&#x27;s behavior. Appetitive behaviour also known as approach behaviour, and consummatory behaviour, are the only processes that involve energy intake, whereas all other behaviours affect the release of energy. When stressed, appetite levels may increase and result in an increase of food intake. Decreased desire to eat is termed anorexia, while polyphagia (or &quot;hyperphagia&quot;) is increased eating. Dysregulation of appetite contributes to ARFID, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, cachexia, overeating, and binge eating disorder.

==Role in disease==
A limited or excessive appetite is not necessarily pathological. Abnormal appetite could be defined as eating habits causing malnutrition and related conditions such as obesity and its related problems.

Both genetic and environmental factors may regulate appetite, and abnormalities in either may lead to abnormal appetite. Poor appetite (anorexia) can have numerous causes, but may be a result of physical (infectious, autoimmune or malignant disease) or psychological (stress, mental disorders) factors. Likewise, hyperphagia (excessive eating) may be a result of hormonal imbalances, mental disorders (e.g., depression) and others. Dyspepsia, also known as indigestion, can also affect appetite as one of its symptoms is feeling &quot;overly full&quot; soon after beginning a meal. Taste and smell (&quot;dysgeusia&quot;, bad taste) or the lack thereof may also affect appetite.

Abnormal appetite may also be linked to genetics on a chromosomal scale, shown by the 1950s discovery of Prader–Willi syndrome, a type of obesity caused by chromosome alterations. Additionally, anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are more commonly found in females than males – thus hinting at a possibility of a linkage to the X-chromosome.

=== Eating disorders ===
Dysregulation of appetite lies at the root of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa is a mental disorder characterized as severe dietary restriction and intense fear of weight gain. Furthermore, persons with anorexia nervosa may exercise ritualistically. Individuals who have anorexia have high levels of ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite, so the body is trying to cause hunger, but the urge to eat is being suppressed by the person. Binge eating disorder (commonly referred to as BED) is described as eating excessively (or uncontrollably) between periodic time intervals. The risk for BED can be present in children and most commonly manifests during adulthood. Studies suggest that the heritability of BED in adults is approximately 50%. Similarly to bulimia, some people may be involved in purging and binging. They might vomit after food intake or take purgatives. Body dysmorphic disorder may involve food restriction in an attempt to deal with a perceived fault, and may be associated with depression and social isolation.

=== Obesity ===
Various hereditary forms of obesity have been traced to defects in hypothalamic signaling (such as the leptin receptor and the MC-4 receptor) or are still awaiting characterization – Prader-Willi syndrome – in addition, decreased response to satiety may promote development of obesity. It has been found that ghrelin-reactive IgG immunoglobulins affect ghrelin&#x27;s orexigenic response.

Other than genetically stimulated appetite abnormalities, there are physiological ones that do not require genes for activation. For example, ghrelin and leptin are released from the stomach and adipose cells, respectively, into the blood stream. Ghrelin stimulates feelings of hunger, whereas leptin stimulates feelings of satisfaction from food. Any changes in normal production levels of these two hormones can lead to obesity. The amount of leptin hormone production is stimulated by body fat percentage. When body fat accumulates there is overproduction of leptin causing a resistant hypothalamus and eventually almost no leptin effect. From then all ghrelin production causes insatiable appetite.

=== Pediatric eating problems ===
Eating issues such as &quot;picky eating&quot; affects about 25% of children, but among children with development disorders this number may be significantly higher, which in some cases may be related to the sounds, smells, and tastes (sensory processing disorder).

==Pharmacology and treatment==
The glycemic index is thought to affect satiety; a study investigating the effect of satiety found that a high-glycemic food, potatoes, reduced appetite more than a low glycemic index food.

=== Suppression ===
Mechanisms controlling appetite are a potential target for weight loss drugs. Appetite control mechanisms seem to strongly counteract undereating, whereas they appear weak to control overeating. Early anorectics (appetite suppressants) were fenfluramine and phentermine. A more recent addition is sibutramine which increases serotonin and noradrenaline levels in the central nervous system, but had to be withdrawn from the market when it was shown to have an adverse cardiovascular risk profile. Similarly, the appetite suppressant rimonabant (a cannabinoid receptor antagonist) had to be withdrawn when it was linked with worsening depression and increased risk of suicide. Recent reports on recombinant PYY 3-36 suggest that this agent may contribute to weight loss by suppressing appetite.

Given the epidemic proportions of obesity in the Western world and the fact that it is increasing rapidly in some poorer countries, observers expect developments in this area to snowball in the near future.

=== Stimulation ===
Weight loss or loss of appetite (&quot;cachexia&quot;) is an effect of some diseases, and a side effect of some prescription drugs. Stimulants such as methylphenidate commonly reduce appetite in patients, and have been prescribed off-label for weight loss. Three agents are approved for appetite stimulation in the United States: megestrol acetate - a progesterone available as an oral tablet, oxandrolone - an oral anabolic steroid, and dronabinol - THC, the principal cannabinoid in marijuana, available in an oral capsule.

Ghrelin, a gut hormone recognized as affecting appetite, is under investigation. Ghrelin itself must be delivered parenterally and research has therefore focused on substances that can be taken orally. Rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, is under preliminary research for its potential to stimulate ghrelin and appetite.

<text>In bioinformatics, sequence analysis is the process of subjecting a DNA, RNA or peptide sequence to any of a wide range of analytical methods to understand its features, function, structure, or evolution. It can be performed on the entire genome, transcriptome or proteome of an organism, and can also involve only selected segments or regions, like tandem repeats and transposable elements. Methodologies used include sequence alignment, searches against biological databases, and others.

Since the development of methods of high-throughput production of gene and protein sequences, the rate of addition of new sequences to the databases increased very rapidly. Such a collection of sequences does not, by itself, increase the scientist&#x27;s understanding of the biology of organisms. However, comparing these new sequences to those with known functions is a key way of understanding the biology of an organism from which the new sequence comes. Thus, sequence analysis can be used to assign function to coding and non-coding regions in a biological sequence usually by comparing sequences and studying similarities and differences. Nowadays, there are many tools and techniques that provide the sequence comparisons (sequence alignment) and analyze the alignment product to understand its biology.

Sequence analysis in molecular biology includes a very wide range of processes:

#The comparison of sequences to find similarity, often to infer if they are related (homologous)
#Identification of intrinsic features of the sequence such as active sites, post translational modification sites, gene-structures, reading frames, distributions of introns and exons and regulatory elements
#Identification of sequence differences and variations such as point mutations and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in order to get the genetic marker.
#Revealing the evolution and genetic diversity of sequences and organisms
#Identification of molecular structure from sequence alone.

== History ==

Since the very first sequences of the insulin protein were characterized by Fred Sanger in 1951, biologists have been trying to use this knowledge to understand the function of molecules. He and his colleagues&#x27; discoveries contributed to the successful sequencing of the first DNA-based genome. The method used in this study, which is called the “Sanger method” or Sanger sequencing, was a milestone in sequencing long strand molecules such as DNA. This method was eventually used in the human genome project. According to Michael Levitt, sequence analysis was born in the period from 1969 to 1977. In 1969 the analysis of sequences of transfer RNAs was used to infer residue interactions from correlated changes in the nucleotide sequences, giving rise to a model of the tRNA secondary structure. In 1970, Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch published the first computer algorithm for aligning two sequences. Over this time, developments in obtaining nucleotide sequence improved greatly, leading to the publication of the first complete genome of a bacteriophage in 1977. Robert Holley and his team in Cornell University were believed to be the first to sequence an RNA molecule.

== Overview of nucleotide sequence analysis (DNA &amp; RNA) ==

Nucleotide sequence analyses identify functional elements like protein binding sites, uncover genetic variations like SNPs, study gene expression patterns, and understand the genetic basis of traits. It helps to understand mechanisms that contribute to processes like replication and transcription. Some of the tasks involved are outlined below.

=== Quality control and preprocessing === 
Quality control assesses the quality of sequencing reads obtained from the sequencing technology (e.g. Illumina). It is the first step in sequence analysis to limit wrong conclusions due to poor quality data. The tools used at this stage depend on the sequencing platform. For instance, FastQC checks the quality of short reads (including RNA sequences), Nanoplot or PycoQC are used for long read sequences (e.g. Nanopore sequence reads), and MultiQC aggregates the result of FastQC in a webpage format. 

Quality control provides information such as read lengths, GC content, presence of adapter sequences (for short reads), and a quality score, which is often expressed on a PHRED scale. If adapters or other artifacts from PCR amplification are present in the reads (particularly short reads), they are removed using software such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt.

=== Read alignment ===

At this step, sequencing reads whose quality have been improved are mapped to a reference genome using alignment tools like BWA for short DNA sequence reads, minimap for long read DNA sequences, and STAR for RNA sequence reads. The purpose of mapping is to find the origin of any given read based on the reference sequence. It is also important for detecting variations or phylogenetic studies.
The output from this step, that is, the aligned reads, are stored in compatible file formats known as SAM, which contains information about the reference genome as well as individual reads. Alternatively, BAM file formats are preferred as they use much less desk or storage space.

Note: This is different from sequence alignment which compares two or more whole sequences (or sequence regions) to quantify similarity or differences or to identify an unknown sequence (as discussed below).

The following analyses steps are peculiar to DNA sequences:

=== Variant calling === 

Identifying variants is a popular aspect of sequence analysis as variants often contain information of biological significance, such as explaining the mechanism of drug resistance in an infectious disease. These variants could be single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels), and large structural variants. The read alignments are sorted using SAMtools, after which variant callers such as GATK are used to identify differences compared to the reference sequence. 

The choice of variant calling tool depends heavily on the sequencing technology used, so GATK is often used when working with short reads, while long read sequences require tools like DeepVariant and Sniffles. Tools may also differ based on organism (prokaryotes or eukaryotes), source of sequence data (cancer vs metagenomic), and variant type of interest (SNVs or structural variants). The output of variant calling is typically in vcf format, and can be filtered using allele frequencies, quality scores, or other factors based on the research question at hand.

=== Variant annotation ===

This step adds context to the variant data using curated information from peer-reviewed papers and publicly available databases like gnomAD and Ensembl. Variants can be annotated with information about genomic features, functional consequences, regulatory elements, and population frequencies using tools like ANNOVAR or SnpEff, or custom scripts and pipeline. The output from this step is an annotation file in bed or txt format.

=== Visualization and interpretation === 

Genomic data, such as read alignments, coverage plots, and variant calls, can be visualized using genome browsers like IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) or UCSC Genome Browser. Interpretation of the results is done in the context of the biological question or hypothesis under investigation. The output can be a graphical representation of data in the forms of Circos plots, volcano plots, etc., or other forms of report describing the observations.

DNA sequence analysis could also involve statistical modeling to infer relationships and epigenetic analysis, like identifying differential methylation regions using a tool like DSS.

The following steps are peculiar to RNA sequences:
=== Gene expression analysis === 

Mapped RNA sequences are analyzed to estimate gene expression levels using quantification tools such as HTSeq, and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between experimental conditions using statistical methods like DESeq2. This is carried out to compare the expression levels of genes or isoforms between or across different samples, and infer biological relevance.
The output of gene expression analysis is typically a table with values representing the expression levels of gene IDs or names in rows and samples in the columns as well as standard errors and p-values. The results in the table can be further visualized using volcano plots and heatmaps, where colors represent the estimated expression level. Packages like ggplot2 in R and Matplotlib in Python are often used to create the visuals. The table can also be annotated using a reference annotation file, usually in GTF or GFF format to provide more context about the genes, such as the chromosome name, strand, and start and positions, and aid result interpretation.

=== Functional enrichment analysis === 

Functional enrichment analysis identifies biological processes, pathways, and functional impacts associated with differentially expressed genes obtained from the previous step. It uses tools like GOSeq and Pathview. This creates a table with information about what pathways and molecular processes are associated with the differentially expressed genes, what genes are down or upregulated, and what gene ontology terms are recurrent or over-represented. 

RNA sequence analysis explores gene expression dynamics and regulatory mechanisms underlying biological processes and diseases. Interpretation of images and tables are carried out within the context of the hypotheses being investigated.

== Analyzing protein sequences ==

Proteome sequence analysis studies the complete set of proteins expressed by an organism or a cell under specific conditions. It describes protein structure, function, post-translational modifications, and interactions within biological systems. It often starts with raw mass spectrometry (MS) data from proteomics experiments, typically in mzML, mzXML, or RAW file formats.

Beyond preprocessing raw MS data to remove noise, normalize intensities, and detect peaks and converting proprietary file formats (e.g., RAW) to open-source formats (mzML, mzXML) for compatibility with downstream analysis tools, other analytical steps include peptide identification, peptide quantification, protein inference and quantification, generating quality control report, and normalization, imputation and significance testing. The choice and order of analytical steps depend on the MS method used, which can either be data dependent acquisition (DDA) or independent acquisition (DIA). 

== Genome browsers in sequence analysis ==

Genome browsers offer a non-code, user-friendly interface to visualize genomes and genomic segments, identify genomic features, and analyze the relationship between numerous genomic elements. The three primary genome browsers—Ensembl genome browser, UCSC genome browser, and the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)—support different sequence analysis procedures, including genome assembly, genome annotation, and comparative genomics like exploring differential expression patterns and identifying conserved regions. All browsers support multiple data formats for upload and download and provide links to external tools and resources for sequence analyses, which contributes to their versatility. 

== Sequence alignment ==

There are millions of protein and nucleotide sequences known. These sequences fall into many groups of related sequences known as protein families or gene families. Relationships between these sequences are usually discovered by aligning them together and assigning this alignment a score. There are two main types of sequence alignment. Pair-wise sequence alignment only compares two sequences at a time and multiple sequence alignment compares many sequences. Two important algorithms for aligning pairs of sequences are the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the Smith-Waterman algorithm. Popular tools for sequence alignment include: 
*Pair-wise alignment - BLAST, Dot plots 
*Multiple alignment - ClustalW, PROBCONS, MUSCLE, MAFFT, and T-Coffee.
A common use for pairwise sequence alignment is to take a sequence of interest and compare it to all known sequences in a database to identify homologous sequences. In general, the matches in the database are ordered to show the most closely related sequences first, followed by sequences with diminishing similarity. These matches are usually reported with a measure of statistical significance such as an Expectation value.

==Profile comparison==
In 1987, Michael Gribskov, Andrew McLachlan, and David Eisenberg introduced the method of profile comparison for identifying distant similarities between proteins. Rather than using a single sequence, profile methods use a multiple sequence alignment to encode a profile which contains information about the conservation level of each residue. These profiles can then be used to search collections of sequences to find sequences that are related. Profiles are also known as Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs). In 1993, a probabilistic interpretation of profiles was introduced by Anders Krogh and colleagues using hidden Markov models. These models have become known as profile-HMMs.

In recent years, methods have been developed that allow the comparison of profiles directly to each other. These are known as profile-profile comparison methods.

== Sequence assembly ==

Sequence assembly refers to the reconstruction of a DNA sequence by aligning and merging small DNA fragments. It is an integral part of modern DNA sequencing. Since presently-available DNA sequencing technologies are ill-suited for reading long sequences, large pieces of DNA (such as genomes) are often sequenced by (1) cutting the DNA into small pieces, (2) reading the small fragments, and (3) reconstituting the original DNA by merging the information on various fragments.

Recently, sequencing multiple species at one time is one of the top research objectives. Metagenomics is the study of microbial communities directly obtained from the environment. Different from cultured microorganisms from the lab, the wild sample usually contains dozens, sometimes even thousands of types of microorganisms from their original habitats. Recovering the original genomes can prove to be very challenging.

== Gene prediction ==

Gene prediction or gene finding refers to the process of identifying the regions of genomic DNA that encode genes. This includes protein-coding genes as well as RNA genes, but may also include the prediction of other functional elements such as regulatory regions. Geri is one of the first and most important steps in understanding the genome of a species once it has been sequenced. In general, the prediction of bacterial genes is significantly simpler and more accurate than the prediction of genes in eukaryotic species that usually have complex intron/exon patterns. Identifying genes in long sequences remains a problem, especially when the number of genes is unknown. Hidden markov models can be part of the solution. Machine learning has played a significant role in predicting the sequence of transcription factors. Traditional sequencing analysis focused on the statistical parameters of the nucleotide sequence itself (The most common programs used are listed in Table 4.1). Another method is to identify homologous sequences based on other known gene sequences (Tools see Table 4.3). The two methods described here are focused on the sequence. However, the shape feature of these molecules such as DNA and protein have also been studied and proposed to have an equivalent, if not higher, influence on the behaviors of these molecules.

== Protein structure prediction ==


The 3D structures of molecules are of major importance to their functions in nature. Since structural prediction of large molecules at an atomic level is a largely intractable problem, some biologists introduced ways to predict 3D structure at a primary sequence level. This includes the biochemical or statistical analysis of amino acid residues in local regions and structural the inference from homologs (or other potentially related proteins) with known 3D structures.

There have been a large number of diverse approaches to solve the structure prediction problem. In order to determine which methods were most effective, a structure prediction competition was founded called CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction).

== Computational approaches and techniques ==

Sequence analysis tasks are often non-trivial to resolve and require the use of relatively complex approaches, many of which are the backbone behind many existing sequence analysis tools. Of the many methods used in practice, the most popular include the following:
* Dynamic programming
* Artificial neural network
* Hidden Markov model
* Support vector machine
* Clustering
* Bayesian network
* Regression analysis
* Sequence mining
* Alignment-free sequence analysis

<text>Tom Clancy&#x27;s Net Force is a novel series, created by Tom Clancy and Steve Pieczenik and originally written by Steve Perry. The original series ceased publication in 2006. There was also a spin-off of young adult books called &quot;Net Force Explorers&quot;. The series was rebooted in 2019 with the &quot;Dark Web&quot; novel by Jerome Preisler.

==General==
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Net Force&quot; is aimed at an adult audience, while the related series Net Force Explorers (which follows the adventures of a teen auxiliary of the Net Force in 2025) is aimed at the older teen market.

The initial &quot;Net Force&quot; concept was alluded to in the third &quot;Op-Center&quot; novel, &quot;Games of State&quot;; given that &quot;Net Force&quot; was created by the same two men who created the &quot;Op-Center&quot; series, it can be assumed that they occur in the same universe. However, no direct connection has yet been drawn between the two.

==Main characters==

These characters are in most or all books:

==Relaunch series==

The books in the &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Net Force Relaunch&quot; series so far are:

==In other media==
The first book of the series, &quot;Net Force&quot;, was adapted and altered into a made-for-TV film in 1999, starring Scott Bakula as Alex Michaels and Joanna Going as Toni Fiorella.

<doc id="235554" wikidata="Q1511809" url="?curid=235554" title="Ko-ryū">
<text>is a Japanese term for any kind of Japanese school of traditional arts. The term literally translates as &quot;old school&quot; (&quot;ko&quot;—&#x27;old&#x27;, &quot;ryū&quot;—&#x27;school&#x27;) or &quot;traditional school&quot;. It is sometimes also translated as &quot;old style&quot;.

==Martial Arts==
&quot;Koryū&quot; is often used as a synonymous shorthand for , ancient Japanese martial arts that predate the Meiji Restoration of 1868. In English, the International Hoplology Society draws a distinction between &quot;Koryū&quot; and &quot;Kobudō&quot; martial arts based on their origin and the differences between their ranking of priorities concerning combat, morals, discipline, and/or aesthetic form.

==&quot;Ikebana&quot; (Flower-Arranging)==
&quot;Ko-ryū&quot; is one of the oldest and most traditional schools of &quot;Ikebana&quot;. From it, various other schools have formed that carry its name, such as the &quot;Nihon Ko-ryū&quot;, &quot;Katsura Ko-ryū&quot;, &quot;Miyako Ko-ryū&quot;, &quot;Ko-ryū Shōshōkai&quot;, and .

<doc id="235558" wikidata="Q2918196" url="?curid=235558" title="Denying the correlative">
<text>The informal fallacy of denying the correlative is an attempt made at introducing alternatives where there are none. It is the opposite of the false dilemma, which is denying other alternatives. Its logical form is
Either X or not X,
therefore Y.

For example:

:Judge: So did you kill your landlord or not?
:Kirk: I fought with him.

In the context of a multiple choice question, the best answer must be chosen from the available alternatives. However, in determining whether this fallacy is committed, a close look at the context is required. The essence of denying the correlative is introducing an alternative into a context that logically admits none, but this itself could be taken as an indication that the context is irrational. Even if there are no implicit alternatives, (such as the right to remain silent), assumptions may need to be questioned and clarified or implications may require a disclaimer.

<doc id="235562" wikidata="Q9690" url="?curid=235562" title="Fatigue">
<text>Fatigue is a state of tiredness (which is not sleepiness), exhaustion or loss of energy.

Fatigue (in the medical sense) is sometimes associated with medical conditions including autoimmune disease, organ failure, chronic pain conditions, mood disorders, heart disease, infectious diseases, and post-infectious-disease states. However, fatigue is complex and in up to a third of primary care cases no medical or psychiatric diagnosis is found.

Fatigue (in the general usage sense of normal tiredness) often follows prolonged physical or mental activity. Physical fatigue results from muscle fatigue brought about by intense physical activity. Mental fatigue results from prolonged periods of cognitive activity which impairs cognitive ability, can manifest as sleepiness, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue, and can also impair physical performance.

==Definition==
Fatigue in a medical context is used to cover experiences of low energy that are not caused by normal life.

A 2021 review proposed a definition for fatigue as a starting point for discussion: &quot;A multi-dimensional phenomenon in which the biophysiological, cognitive, motivational and emotional state of the body is affected resulting in significant impairment of the individual&#x27;s ability to function in their normal capacity&quot;.

Another definition is that fatigue is &quot;a significant subjective sensation of weariness, increasing sense of effort, mismatch between effort expended and actual performance, or exhaustion independent from medications, chronic pain, physical deconditioning, anaemia, respiratory dysfunction, depression, and sleep disorders&quot;.

===Terminology===
The use of the term &quot;fatigue&quot; in medical contexts may carry inaccurate connotations from the more general usage of the same word. More accurate terminology may also be needed for variants within the umbrella term of fatigue.

===Comparison with other terms===
====Tiredness====
Tiredness which is a normal result of work, mental stress, anxiety, overstimulation and understimulation, jet lag, active recreation, boredom, or lack of sleep is not considered medical fatigue. This is the tiredness described in MeSH Descriptor Data.

====Sleepiness====
Sleepiness refers to a tendency to fall asleep, whereas fatigue refers to an overwhelming sense of tiredness, lack of energy, and a feeling of exhaustion. Sleepiness and fatigue often coexist as a consequence of sleep deprivation. However sleepiness and fatigue may not correlate. Fatigue is generally considered a longer-term condition than sleepiness (somnolence).

==Presentation==

===Common features===
Distinguishing features of medical fatigue include
* unpredictability,
* variability in severity,
* fatigue being relatively profound/overwhelming, and having extensive impact on daily living,
* lack of improvement with rest,
* where an underlying disease is present, the amount of fatigue is often not commensurate with the severity of the underlying disease.

===Differentiating features===
Differentiating characteristics of fatigue that may help identify the possible cause of fatigue include
* Post-exertional malaise; a common feature of ME/CFS, and experienced by a significant proportion of people with Long Covid, but not a feature of other fatigues.

* Increased by heat or cold; MS fatigue is in many cases affected in this way.
* Remission; MS fatigue may reduce during periods of other MS symptom remission. ME/CFS may also have lower periods of activity.
* Cognitive declines; sleep deprivation causes cognitive and neurobehavioral effects including unstable attention and slowing of response times. ME/CFS and MS may cause brain fog over longer timescales.
* Intermittency; Fatigues often vary in how and when they occur. Some fatigues (RA, cancer fatigue) seem to often be continual (24/7) whilst others (MS, Sjögren&#x27;s, lupus, brain injury) are often intermittent. A 2010 study found that Sjögren&#x27;s patients reported fatigue after rising, an improvement in mid-morning, and worsening later in the day, whereas lupus (SLE) patients reported lower fatigue after rising followed by increasing fatigue through the day. ME/CFS symptoms can be continual, or can fluctuate during the day, from day to day, and over longer periods.
* The pace of onset may be a related differentiating factor; MS fatigue can have abrupt onset.
* Feeling of weight; some fatigues, including that caused by MS, create a sense of weight or gravity; &quot;I feel like I have lead weights attached to my limbs ... or I am being pulled down by gravity.&quot;

Some people may have multiple causes of fatigue.

==Causes==

===Drug use===
A 2021 study in a Korean city found that alcohol consumption was the variable with the most correlation with overall fatigue. A 2020 Norway study found that 69% of substance use disorder patients had severe fatigue symptoms, and particularly those with extensive use of benzodiazepines. Causality, as opposed to correlation, were not proven in these studies.

===Unknown===
In up to a third of fatigue primary care cases, no medical or psychiatric diagnosis is found.
Tiredness is a common medically unexplained symptom.

===Sleep disturbance===
Fatigue can often be traced to poor sleep habits. Sleep deprivation and disruption is associated with subsequent fatigue. Sleep disturbances due to disease may impact fatigue. Caffeine and alcohol can disrupt sleep, causing fatigue.

===Medications===
Fatigue may be a side effect of certain medications (e.g., lithium salts, ciprofloxacin); beta blockers, which can induce exercise intolerance, medicines used to treat allergies or coughs, and many cancer treatments, particularly chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Use of benzodiazepines has been found to correlate with higher fatigue.

===Association with diseases and illnesses===
Fatigue is often associated with diseases and conditions. Some major categories of conditions that often list fatigue as a symptom include physical diseases, substance use illness, mental illnesses, and other diseases and conditions.

====Physical diseases====
* autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, NMOSD, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathy and UCTD; this population&#x27;s primary concern is fatigue;
* blood disorders, such as anemia and hemochromatosis;
* brain injury;
* cancer, in which case it is called cancer fatigue;
* Covid-19 and long Covid;
* developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder;
* endocrine diseases or metabolic disorders: diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and Addison&#x27;s disease;
* fibromyalgia;
* heart failure and heart attack;
* HIV
* inborn errors of metabolism such as fructose malabsorption;
* infectious diseases such as infectious mononucleosis or tuberculosis;
* irritable bowel syndrome;
* kidney diseases, e.g., acute renal failure, chronic renal failure;
* leukemia or lymphoma;
* liver failure or liver diseases, e.g., hepatitis;
* Lyme disease;
* neurological disorders such as narcolepsy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and post-concussion syndrome;
* physical trauma and other pain-causing conditions, such as arthritis;
* sleep deprivation or sleep disorders, e.g. sleep apnea;
* stroke
* thyroid disease such as hypothyroidism;
*sarcoidosis

====Mental illnesses====
* anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder;
* depression;
* eating disorders, which can produce fatigue due to inadequate nutrition;

====Other====
* myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
* idiopathic chronic fatigue, a term used to describe chronic fatigue which does not have symptoms of ME/CFS. However ICF does not have a dedicated diagnostic code in the World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-11 classification.
* Gulf War syndrome;
====Primary vs. secondary====
In some areas, it has been proposed that fatigue be separated into 
*primary fatigue, caused directly by a disease process, and 
*ordinary or secondary fatigue, caused by a range of causes including exertion and also secondary impacts on a person of having a disease (such as disrupted sleep). 
The ICD-11 MG22 definition of fatigue captures both types of fatigue; it includes fatigue that &quot;occur[s] in the absence of... exertion... as a symptom of health conditions.&quot;

===Obesity===
Obesity correlates with higher fatigue levels and incidence.

===Somatic symptom disorder===
In somatic symptom disorder the patient is overfocused on a physical symptom, such as fatigue, that may or may not be explained by a medical condition.

===Adverse life events===
Adverse life events have been associated with fatigue.

===Scientifically unsupported causes===
The concept of adrenal fatigue is often raised in media but no scientific basis has been found for it.

==Mechanisms==

The mechanisms that cause fatigue are not well understood. Several mechanisms may be in operation within a patient, with the relative contribution of each mechanism differing over time.

Proposed fatigue explanations due to permanent changes in the brain may have difficulty in explaining the &quot;unpredictability&quot; and &quot;variability&quot; (i.e. appearing intermittently during the day, and not on all days) of the fatigue associated with inflammatory rheumatic diseases and autoimmune diseases (such as multiple sclerosis).

===Inflammation===
Inflammation distorts neural chemistry, brain function and functional connectivity across a broad range of brain networks, and has been linked to many types of fatigue. Findings implicate neuroinflammation in the etiology of fatigue in autoimmune and related disorders. Low-grade inflammation may cause an imbalance between energy availability and expenditure.

Cytokines are small protein molecules that modulate immune responses and inflammation (as well as other functions) and may have causal roles in fatigue. However a 2019 review was inconclusive as to whether cytokines play any definitive role in ME/CFS.

===Reduced brain connectivity===
Fatigue has been correlated with reductions in structural and functional connectivity in the brain. This has included in post-stroke, MS, NMOSD and MOG, and ME/CFS. This was also found for fatigue after brain injury, including a significant linear correlation between self-reported fatigue and brain functional connectivity.

Areas of the brain for which there is evidence of relation to fatigue are the thalamus and middle frontal cortex, fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular, and default mode network, salience network, and thalamocortical loop areas.

A 2024 review found that structural connectivity changes may underlie fatigue in pwRRMS but that the overall results were inconclusive, possibly explained by heterogeneity and limited number of studies.

A small 2023 study found that infratentorial lesion volume (cerebellar and brainstem) was a relatively good predictor of RRMS fatigue severity.

===Damage to brain white matter===
Studies have found MS fatigue correlates with damage to NAWM (normal appearing white matter) (which will not show on normal MRI but will show on DTI (diffusion tensor imaging)). The correlation becomes unreliable in patients aged over 65 due to damage due to ageing.

===Heat shock proteins===
A small 2016 study found that primary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome patients with high fatigue, when compared with those with low fatigue, had significantly higher plasma concentrations of HSP90α, and a tendency to higher concentrations of HSP72. A small 2020 study of Crohn&#x27;s disease patients found that higher fatigue visual analogue scale (fVAS) scores correlated with higher HSP90α levels. A related small 2012 trial investigating if application of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) would reduce fatigue in primary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome patients was inconclusive.

==Measurement==
Fatigue is currently measured by many different self-measurement surveys. Examples are the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) and the Fatigue Severity Scale. There is no consensus on best practice, and the existing surveys do not capture the intermittent nature of some forms of fatigue.

==Diagnosis==
===Diagnosis guidance===
A 2023 guidance indicates the following
* in the primary care setting, a medical or psychiatric diagnosis is found in at least two-thirds of patients;
* the most common diagnoses are viral illness, upper respiratory infection, iron-deficiency anaemia, acute bronchitis, adverse effects of a medical agent in the proper dose, and depression or other mental disorder, such as panic disorder, and somatisation disorder;
* the origin of fatigue may be central, brain-derived, or peripheral, usually of a neuromuscular origin—it may be attributed to physical illness, psychological (e.g., psychiatric disorder), social (e.g., family problems), and physiological factors (e.g., old age), occupational illness (e.g., workplace stress);
* when unexplained, clinically evaluated chronic fatigue can be separated into ME/CFS and idiopathic chronic fatigue.

A 2016 German review found that
* about 20% of people complaining of tiredness to a GP (general practitioner) suffered from a depressive disorder.
* anaemia, malignancies and other serious somatic diseases were only very rarely found in fatigued primary care patients, with prevalence rates hardly differing from non-fatigued patients.
* if fatigue occurred in primary care patients as an isolated symptom without additional abnormalities in the medical history and in the clinical examination, then extensive diagnostic testing rarely helped detect serious diseases. Such testing might also lead to false-positive tests.

A 2014 Australian review recommended that a period of watchful waiting may be appropriate if there are no major warning signs.

A 2009 study found that about 50% of people who had fatigue received a diagnosis that could explain the fatigue after a year with the condition. In those people who had a possible diagnosis, musculoskeletal (19.4%) and psychological problems (16.5%) were the most common. Definitive physical conditions were only found in 8.2% of cases.

===Classification===

====By type====

=====Uni- or multi-dimensional=====
Fatigue can be seen as a uni-dimensional phenomenon that influences different aspects of human life. It can be multi-faceted and broadly defined, making understanding the causes of its manifestations especially difficult in conditions with diverse pathology including autoimmune diseases.

A 2021 review considered that different &quot;types/subsets&quot; of fatigue may exist and that patients normally present with more than one such &quot;type/subset&quot;. These different &quot;types/subsets&quot; of fatigue may be different dimensions of the same symptom, and the relative manifestations of each may depend on the relative contribution of different mechanisms. Inflammation may be the root causal mechanism in many cases.

=====Physical=====
Physical fatigue, or muscle fatigue, is the temporary physical inability of muscles to perform optimally. The onset of muscle fatigue during physical activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual&#x27;s level of physical fitness – other factors include sleep deprivation and overall health. Physical fatigue can be caused by a lack of energy in the muscle, by a decrease of the efficiency of the neuromuscular junction or by a reduction of the drive originating from the central nervous system, and can be reversed by rest. The central component of fatigue is triggered by an increase of the level of serotonin in the central nervous system. During motor activity, serotonin released in synapses that contact motor neurons promotes muscle contraction. During high level of motor activity, the amount of serotonin released increases and a spillover occurs. Serotonin binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on the axonal initial segment of motor neurons with the result that nerve impulse initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.

Muscle strength testing can be used to determine the presence of a neuromuscular disease, but cannot determine its cause. Additional testing, such as electromyography, can provide diagnostic information, but information gained from muscle strength testing alone is not enough to diagnose most neuromuscular disorders.

=====Mental===== 

Mental fatigue is a temporary inability to maintain optimal cognitive performance. The onset of mental fatigue during any cognitive activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual&#x27;s cognitive ability, and also upon other factors, such as sleep deprivation and overall health.

Mental fatigue has also been shown to decrease physical performance. It can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, directed attention fatigue, or disengagement. Research also suggests that mental fatigue is closely linked to the concept of ego depletion, though the validity of the concept is disputed. For example, one pre-registered study of 686 participants found that after exerting mental effort, people are likely to disengage and become less interested in exerting further effort.

Decreased attention can also be described as a more or less decreased level of consciousness. In any case, this can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as operating large vehicles. For instance, a person who is sufficiently somnolent may experience microsleep. However, objective cognitive testing can be used to differentiate the neurocognitive deficits of brain disease from those attributable to tiredness.

The perception of mental fatigue is believed to be modulated by the brain&#x27;s reticular activating system (RAS).

Fatigue impacts a driver&#x27;s reaction time, awareness of hazards around them and their attention. Drowsy drivers are three times more likely to be involved in a car crash, and being awake over 20 hours is the equivalent of driving with a blood-alcohol concentration level of 0.08%.

=====Neurological fatigue=====

People with multiple sclerosis experience a form of overwhelming tiredness that can occur at any time of the day, for any duration, and that does not necessarily recur in a recognizable pattern for any given patient, referred to as &quot;neurological fatigue&quot;, and often as &quot;multiple sclerosis fatigue&quot; or &quot;lassitude&quot;. People with autoimmune diseases including inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and primary Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, experience similar fatigue.
Attempts have been made to isolate causes of central nervous system fatigue.

====By timescale====

=====Acute=====
Acute fatigue is that which is temporary and self-limited. Acute fatigue is most often caused by an infection such as the common cold and can be cognized as one part of the sickness behavior response occurring when the immune system fights an infection. Other common causes of acute fatigue include depression and chemical causes, such as dehydration, poisoning, low blood sugar, or mineral or vitamin deficiencies.

=====Prolonged=====
Prolonged fatigue is a self-reported, persistent (constant) fatigue lasting at least one month.

=====Chronic=====
Chronic fatigue is a self-reported fatigue lasting at least 6 consecutive months. Chronic fatigue may be either persistent or relapsing. Chronic fatigue is a symptom of many chronic illnesses and of idiopathic chronic fatigue.

====By effect====

Fatigue can have significant negative impacts on quality of life. Profound and debilitating fatigue is the most common complaint reported among individuals with autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. Fatigue has been described by sufferers as &#x27;incomprehensible&#x27; due to its unpredictable occurrence, lack of relationship to physical effort and different character as compared to tiredness.

====WHO classification====
The World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-11 classification
includes a category MG22 Fatigue (typically fatigue following exertion but sometimes may occur in the absence of such exertion as a symptom of health conditions), and many other categories where fatigue is mentioned as a secondary result of other factors. It does not include any fatigue-based psychiatric illness (unless it is accompanied by related psychiatric symptoms).

DSM-5 lists &#x27;fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day&#x27; as one factor in diagnosing depression.

==Treatment and management==

Management may include review of factors and methods as explained below.

===Cessation of medications causing fatigue===
Taking of medications with side effects of contributing to fatigue may be ceased.
===Medications to treat fatigue===
The UK NICE recommends consideration of amantadine, modafinil, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for MS fatigue. A PCORI review, however, found amantadine, methylphenidate, and modafinil no more effective than placebo in reducing fatigue, with side effects reported. Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, amphetamines, and modafinil have been used in the treatment of fatigue related to depression, and medical illness such as chronic fatigue syndrome and cancer. They have also been used to counteract fatigue in sleep loss and in aviation.

===Mental health tools===
CBT can be useful for fatigue, including ME/CFS but is not included in NICE guidelines for ME/CFS treatment.

===Other approaches===
====Avoidance of body heat====
Fatigue in MS often correlates with relatively high endogenous body temperature.

====Improved sleep====
Improving sleep has been associated with reduced fatigue but only in small studies.

====Intermittent fasting====
A very small 2022 study found 40% reductions in fatigue categorisations after three months of 16:8 intermittent fasting.

====Vagus nerve stimulation====
A very small 2023 study of Sjogren&#x27;s patients showed reductions in self-reported fatigue after 56 days of vagus nerve stimulation.

====Qigong and Tai Chi====
Qigong and Tai chi have been postulated as helpful to reduce fatigue, but the evidence is of low quality.

===Approaches to managing fatigue===
Some health systems help people manage their fatigue better through attitude changes and skills transference.

==Prevalence==
2023 guidance stated fatigue prevalence is between 4.3% and 21.9%. Prevalence is higher in women than men.

A 2021 German study found that fatigue was the main or secondary reason for 10–20% of all consultations with a primary care physician.

A large study based on the 2004 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a biennial longitudinal survey of US adults aged 51 and above, with mean age 65, found that 33% of women and 29% of men self-reported fatigue.

Fatigue represents a large health economic burden and unmet need to patients and to society.

==Possible purposes of fatigue==

===Body resource management purposes===
Fatigue has been posited as a bio-psycho-physiological state reflecting the body&#x27;s overall strategy in resource (energy) management. Fatigue may occur when the body wants to limit resource utilisation (&quot;rationing&quot;) in order to use resources for healing (part of sickness behaviour) or conserve energy for a particular current or future anticipated need, including a threat.

===Evolutionary purposes===
It has been posited that fatigue had evolutionary benefits in making more of the body&#x27;s resources available for healing processes, such as immune responses, and in limiting disease spread by tending to reduce social interactions.

<text>Algor mortis (), the third stage of death, is the change in body temperature post mortem, until the ambient temperature is matched. This is generally a steady decline, although if the ambient temperature is above the body temperature (such as in a hot desert), the change in temperature will be positive, as the (relatively) cooler body equalizes with the warmer environment. External factors can have a significant influence.

The term was first used by Bennet Dowler in 1849. The first published measurements of the intervals of temperature after death were done by John Davy in 1839.

== Applicability ==

A measured rectal temperature can give some indication of the time of death. Although the heat conduction which leads to body cooling follows an exponential decay curve, it can be approximated as a linear process: 2 °C during the first hour and 1 °C per hour until the body nears ambient temperature.

The Glaister equation estimates the hours elapsed since death as a linear function of the rectal temperature:

:formula_1
or
:formula_2
==Variability==
Generally, temperature change is considered an inaccurate means of determining time of death, as the rate of change is affected by several key factors, including:
* Stability or fluctuation of the ambient temperature.
* The thickness (i.e. thermal insulation value) and body coverage of clothing or similar materials.
* The thermal conductivity of the surface on which a body lies.
* Diseases or drugs which increase body temperature and thereby raise the starting temperature of the corpse at the time of death
* The existence of a &quot;temperature plateau&quot;, a highly variable length of time in which the body does not cool.

<text>Suction is the day-to-day term for the movement of gases or liquids along a pressure gradient with the implication that the movement occurs because the lower pressure pulls the gas or liquid. However, the forces acting in this case do not originate from just the lower pressure side, but also from the side of the higher pressure, as a reaction to the pressure difference.

When the pressure in one part of a physical system is reduced relative to another, the fluid or gas in the higher pressure region will exert a force relative to the region of lowered pressure, referred to as pressure-gradient force. If all gas or fluid is removed the result is a perfect vacuum in which the pressure is zero. Hence, no negative pressure forces can be generated. Accordingly, from a physics point of view, the objects are not pulled but pushed.

== Examples ==
Pressure reduction may be static, as in a piston and cylinder arrangement, or dynamic, as in the case of a vacuum cleaner when air flow results in a reduced pressure region.

When animals breathe, the diaphragm and muscles around the rib cage cause a change of volume in the lungs. The increased volume of the chest cavity decreases the pressure inside, creating an imbalance with the ambient air pressure, resulting in suction. Similarly, when a straw is used to suck a liquid into the mouth, the atmospheric pressure pushes the liquid through the straw along the pressure gradient.

A common semantic mistake is made when in case of accidents with spaceships or aircraft in which objects are blown out of the vessel in the case of an uncontrolled decompression which is often wrongly referred to as objects being sucked out.

<text>The rendezvous dilemma is a logical dilemma, typically formulated in this way:

:Two people have a date in a park they have never been to before. Arriving separately in the park, they are both surprised to discover that it is a huge area and consequently they cannot find one another. In this situation each person has to choose between waiting in a fixed place in the hope that the other will find them, or else starting to look for the other in the hope that &quot;they&quot; have chosen to wait somewhere.

If they both choose to wait, they will never meet. If they both choose to walk there are chances that they meet and chances that they do not. If one chooses to wait and the other chooses to walk, then there is a theoretical certainty that they will meet eventually; in practice, though, it may take too long for it to be guaranteed. The question posed, then, is: what strategies should they choose to maximize their probability of meeting?

Examples of this class of problems are known as rendezvous problems. These problems were first introduced informally by Steve Alpern in 1976, and he formalised the continuous version of the problem in 1995. This has led to much recent research in rendezvous search. Even the symmetric rendezvous problem played in &quot;n&quot; discrete locations (sometimes called the &quot;Mozart Cafe Rendezvous Problem&quot;) has turned out to be very difficult to solve, and in 1990 Richard Weber and Eddie Anderson conjectured the optimal strategy. In 2012 the conjecture was proved for &quot;n&quot; = 3 by Richard Weber. This was the first non-trivial symmetric rendezvous search problem to be fully solved. The corresponding asymmetric rendezvous problem has a simple optimal solution: one player stays put and the other player visits a random permutation of the locations. 

As well as being problems of theoretical interest, rendezvous problems include real-world problems with applications in the fields of synchronization, operating system design, operations research, and even search and rescue operations planning.

==Deterministic rendezvous problem==

The deterministic rendezvous problem is a variant of the rendezvous problem where the players, or &quot;robots&quot;, must find each other by following a deterministic sequence of instructions. Although each robot follows the same instruction sequence, a unique label assigned to each robot is used for symmetry breaking.

<text>The questionable cause—also known as causal fallacy, false cause, or non causa pro causa (&quot;non-cause for cause&quot; in Latin)—is a category of informal fallacies in which the cause or causes is/are incorrectly identified. In other words, it is a fallacy of reaching a conclusion that one thing caused another, simply because they are regularly associated.

Questionable cause can be logically reduced to: &quot;A is regularly associated with B; therefore, A causes B.&quot;

For example: &quot;Every time I score an A on the test its a sunny day. Therefore the sunny day causes me to score well on the test.&quot; Here is the example the two events may coincide or correlate, but have no causal connection.

Fallacies of questionable cause include:
* Circular cause and consequence
* Correlation implies causation (&quot;cum hoc, ergo propter hoc&quot;)
** Third-cause fallacy
** Wrong direction
* Fallacy of the single cause
* &quot;Post hoc ergo propter hoc&quot;
* Observational interpretation fallacy
* Regression fallacy
* Texas sharpshooter fallacy
* Jumping to conclusions
* Association fallacy
* Magical thinking

<doc id="235589" wikidata="Q22718" url="?curid=235589" title="Axolotl">
<text>The axolotl (; from ) (Ambystoma mexicanum) is a paedomorphic salamander closely related to the tiger salamander. It is unusual among amphibians in that it reaches adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis. Instead of taking to the land, adults remain aquatic and gilled. The species was originally found in several lakes underlying what is now Mexico City, such as Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco. These lakes were drained by Spanish settlers after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, leading to the destruction of much of the axolotl&#x27;s natural habitat.

, the axolotl was near extinction due to urbanization in Mexico City and consequent water pollution, as well as the introduction of invasive species such as tilapia and perch. It is listed as critically endangered in the wild, with a decreasing population of around 50 to 1,000 adult individuals, by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Axolotls are used extensively in scientific research for their ability to regenerate limbs, gills and parts of their eyes and brains. Notably, their ability to regenerate declines with age, but it does not disappear. Axolotls keep modestly growing throughout their life and some consider this trait to be a direct contributor to their regenerative abilities. Further research has been conducted to examine their heart as a model of human single ventricle and excessive trabeculation. Axolotls were also sold as food in Mexican markets and were a staple in the Aztec diet.

Axolotls may be confused with the larval stage of the closely related tiger salamander (&quot;A. tigrinum&quot;), which are widespread in much of North America and occasionally become paedomorphic, or with mudpuppies (&quot;Necturus&quot; spp.), fully aquatic salamanders from a different family that are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance.

==Description==


A sexually mature adult axolotl, at age 18–27 months, ranges in length from , although a size close to is most common and greater than is rare. Axolotls possess features typical of salamander larvae, including external gills and a caudal fin extending from behind the head to the vent. External gills are usually lost when salamander species mature into adulthood, although the axolotl maintains this feature. This is due to their neoteny evolution, where axolotls are much more aquatic than other salamander species.

Their heads are wide, and their eyes are lidless. Their limbs are underdeveloped and possess long, thin digits. Males are identified by their swollen cloacae lined with papillae, while females are noticeable for their wider bodies full of eggs. Three pairs of external gill stalks (rami) originate behind their heads and are used to move oxygenated water. The external gill rami are lined with filaments (fimbriae) to increase surface area for gas exchange. Four-gill slits lined with gill rakers are hidden underneath the external gills, which prevent food from entering and allow particles to filter through.

Axolotls have barely visible vestigial teeth, which develop during metamorphosis. The primary method of feeding is by suction, during which their rakers interlock to close the gill slits. External gills are used for respiration, although buccal pumping (gulping air from the surface) may also be used to provide oxygen to their lungs. Buccal pumping can occur in a two-stroke manner that pumps air from the mouth to the lungs, and with four-stroke that reverses this pathway with compression forces.
Axolotls have four pigmentation genes; when mutated, they create different color variants. The normal wild-type animal is brown or tan with gold speckles and an olive undertone. The five most common mutant colors are listed below.

# Leucistic: pale pink with black eyes.
# Xanthic: grey, with black eyes.
# Albino: pale pink or white, with red eyes, which is more common in axolotls than other species.
# Melanoid: all black or dark blue with no gold speckling or olive tone.

In addition, there is wide individual variability in the size, frequency, and intensity of the gold speckling, and at least one variant develops a black and white piebald appearance upon reaching maturity. Because pet breeders frequently cross the variant colors, double homozygous mutants are common in the pet trade, especially white/pink animals with pink eyes that are double homozygous mutants for both the albino and leucistic trait. Axolotls also have some limited ability to alter their color to provide better camouflage by changing the relative size and thickness of their melanophores.

==Habitat and ecology==
The axolotl is native only to the freshwater of Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco in the Valley of Mexico. Lake Chalco no longer exists, having been drained as a flood control measure, and Lake Xochimilco remains a remnant of its former self, existing mainly as canals. The water temperature in Xochimilco rarely rises above , although it may fall to in the winter, and perhaps lower.

Surveys in 1998, 2003, and 2008 found 6,000, 1,000, and 100 axolotls per square kilometer in its Lake Xochimilco habitat, respectively. A four-month-long search in 2013, however, turned up no surviving individuals in the wild. Just a month later, two wild ones were spotted in a network of canals leading from Xochimilco.

The wild population has been put under heavy pressure by the growth of Mexico City. The axolotl is currently on the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s annual Red List of threatened species. Non-native fish, such as African tilapia and Asian carp, have also recently been introduced to the waters. These new fish have been eating the axolotls&#x27; young, as well as their primary source of food.

Axolotls are members of the tiger salamander, or &quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot;, species complex, along with all other Mexican species of &quot;Ambystoma&quot;. Their habitat is like that of most neotenic species—a high-altitude body of water surrounded by a risky terrestrial environment. These conditions are thought to favor neoteny. However, a terrestrial population of Mexican tiger salamanders occupies and breeds in the axolotl&#x27;s habitat.

=== Diet ===
The axolotl is carnivorous, consuming small prey such as mollusks, worms, insects, other arthropods, and small fish in the wild. Axolotls locate food by smell, and will &quot;snap&quot; at any potential meal, sucking the food into their stomachs with vacuum force.

==Use as a model organism==
Today, the axolotl is still used in research as a model organism, and large numbers are bred in captivity. They are especially easy to breed compared to other salamanders in their family, which are rarely captive-bred due to the demands of terrestrial life. One attractive feature for research is the large and easily manipulated embryo, which allows viewing of the full development of a vertebrate. Axolotls are used in heart defect studies due to the presence of a mutant gene that causes heart failure in embryos. Since the embryos survive almost to hatching with no heart function, the defect is very observable. The axolotl is also considered an ideal animal model for the study of neural tube closure due to the similarities between human and axolotl neural plate and tube formation; the axolotl&#x27;s neural tube, unlike the frog&#x27;s, is not hidden under a layer of superficial epithelium. There are also mutations affecting other organ systems some of which are not well characterized and others that are. The genetics of the color variants of the axolotl have also been widely studied.

=== Regeneration ===
The feature of the axolotl that attracts most attention is its healing ability: the axolotl does not heal by scarring and is capable of the regeneration of entire lost appendages in a period of months, and, in certain cases, more vital structures, such as tail, limb, central nervous system, and tissues of the eye and heart. They can even restore less vital parts of their brains. They can also readily accept transplants from other individuals, including eyes and parts of the brain—restoring these alien organs to full functionality. In some cases, axolotls have been known to repair a damaged limb, as well as regenerating an additional one, ending up with an extra appendage that makes them attractive to pet owners as a novelty. In metamorphosed individuals, however, the ability to regenerate is greatly diminished. The axolotl is therefore used as a model for the development of limbs in vertebrates. There are three basic requirements for regeneration of the limb: the wound epithelium, nerve signaling, and the presence of cells from the different limb axes. A wound epidermis is quickly formed by the cells to cover up the site of the wound. In the following days, the cells of the wound epidermis divide and grow quickly forming a blastema, which means the wound is ready to heal and undergo patterning to form the new limb.

It is believed that during limb generation, axolotls have a different system to regulate their internal macrophage level and suppress inflammation, as scarring prevents proper healing and regeneration. However, this belief has been questioned by other studies. The axolotl&#x27;s regenerative properties leave the species as the perfect model to study the process of stem cells and its own neoteny feature. Current research can record specific examples of these regenerative properties through tracking cell fates and behaviors, lineage tracing skin triploid cell grafts, pigmentation imaging, electroporation, tissue clearing and lineage tracing from dye labeling. The newer technologies of germline modification and transgenesis are better suited for live imaging the regenerative processes that occur for axolotls.

=== Genome ===
The 32 billion base pair long sequence of the axolotl&#x27;s genome was published in 2018 and was the largest animal genome completed at the time. It revealed species-specific genetic pathways that may be responsible for limb regeneration. Although the axolotl genome is about 10 times as large as the human genome, it encodes a similar number of proteins, namely 23,251 (the human genome encodes about 20,000 proteins). The size difference is mostly explained by a large fraction of repetitive sequences, but such repeated elements also contribute to increased median intron sizes (22,759 bp) which are 13, 16 and 25 times that observed in human (1,750 bp), mouse (1,469 bp) and Tibetan frog (906 bp), respectively.

=== Neoteny ===

Most amphibians begin their lives as aquatic animals which are unable to live on dry land, often being dubbed as tadpoles. To reach adulthood, they go through a process called metamorphosis, in which they lose their gills and start living on land. The axolotl is unusual in that it has a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which is needed for the thyroid to produce thyroxine in order for the axolotl to go through metamorphosis; it keeps its gills and lives in water all its life, even after it becomes an adult and is able to reproduce. Neoteny is the term for reaching sexual maturity without undergoing metamorphosis.

The genes responsible for neoteny in laboratory animals may have been identified; they are not linked in wild populations, suggesting artificial selection is the cause of complete neoteny in laboratory and pet axolotls. The genes responsible have been narrowed down to a small chromosomal region called &quot;met1&quot;, which contains several candidate genes.

==== Metamorphosis ====
The axolotl&#x27;s body has the capacity to go through metamorphosis if given the necessary hormone, but axolotls do not produce it, and must be exposed to it from an external source, after which an axolotl undergoes an artificially-induced metamorphosis and begins living on land. In laboratory conditions, metamorphosis is reliably induced by administering either the thyroid hormone thyroxine or thyroid-stimulating hormone. The former is more commonly used.


An axolotl undergoing metamorphosis experiences a number of physiological changes that help them adapt to life on land. These include increased muscle tone in limbs, the absorption of gills and fins into the body, the development of eyelids, and a reduction in the skin&#x27;s permeability to water, allowing the axolotl to stay more easily hydrated when on land. The lungs of an axolotl, though present alongside gills after reaching non-metamorphosed adulthood, develop further during metamorphosis.

An axolotl that has gone through metamorphosis resembles an adult plateau tiger salamander, though the axolotl differs in its longer toes. Among hobbyists, the process of artificially inducing metamorphosis can often result in death during or even following a successful attempt, and so casual hobbyists are generally discouraged from attempting to induce metamorphosis in pet axolotls. Morphed pet axolotls should be given solid footholds in their enclosure to satisfy their need for land. They should not be given live animals as food.

==== History ====

Six adult axolotls (including a leucistic specimen) were shipped from Mexico City to the &quot;Jardin des Plantes&quot; in Paris in 1863. Unaware of their neoteny, Auguste Duméril was surprised when, instead of the axolotl, he found in the vivarium a new species, similar to the salamander. This discovery was the starting point of research about neoteny. It is not certain that &quot;Ambystoma velasci&quot; specimens were not included in the original shipment. Vilem Laufberger in Prague used thyroid hormone injections to induce an axolotl to grow into a terrestrial adult salamander. The experiment was repeated by Englishman Julian Huxley, who was unaware the experiment had already been done, using ground thyroids. Since then, experiments have been done often with injections of iodine or various thyroid hormones used to induce metamorphosis.

==== In other salamanders ====
Many other species within the axolotl&#x27;s genus are also either entirely neotenic or have neotenic populations. Sirens and &quot;Necturus&quot; are other neotenic salamanders, although unlike axolotls, they cannot be induced to metamorphose by an injection of iodine or thyroxine hormone.

Neoteny has been observed in all salamander families in which it seems to be a survival mechanism, in aquatic environments only of mountain and hill, with little food and, in particular, with little iodine. In this way, salamanders can reproduce and survive in the form of a smaller larval stage, which is aquatic and requires a lower quality and quantity of food compared to the big adult, which is terrestrial. If the salamander larvae ingest a sufficient amount of iodine, directly or indirectly through cannibalism, they quickly begin metamorphosis and transform into bigger terrestrial adults, with higher dietary requirements. In fact, in some high mountain lakes there live dwarf forms of salmonids that are caused by deficiencies in food and, in particular, iodine, which causes cretinism and dwarfism due to hypothyroidism, as it does in humans.

== Threats ==
Axolotls are only native to the Mexican Central Valley. Although the native axolotl population once extended through most of the lakes and wetlands that make up this region, the native habitat is now limited to Lake Xochimilco as a result of the expansion of Mexico City. Lake Xochimilco is not a large body of water, but rather a small series of artificial channels, small lakes, and temporary wetlands.

Lake Xochimilco has poor water quality, caused by the region&#x27;s aquaculture and agriculture demands. It is also maintained by inputs of only partially treated wastewater. Water quality tests reveal a low nitrogen-phosphorus ratio and a high concentration of chlorophyll a, which are indicative of an oxygen-poor environment that is not well-suited for axolotls. In addition, the intensive use of pesticides from agriculture around Lake Xochimilco causes run off into the lake and a reduction of habitat quality for axolotls. The pesticides used contain chemical compounds that studies show to sharply increase mortality in axolotl embryos and larvae. Of the surviving embryo and larvae, there is also an increase of morphological, behavior, and activity abnormalities.

Another factor that threatens the native axolotl population is the introduction of invasive species such as the Nile tilapia and common carp. These invasive fish species threaten axolotl populations by eating their eggs or young and by out-competing them for natural resources. The presence of these species has also been shown to change the behavior of axolotls, causing them to be less active to avoid predation. This reduction in activity greatly impacts the axolotls foraging and mating opportunities.

With such a small native population, there is a large loss of genetic diversity. This lack of genetic diversity can be dangerous for the remaining population, causing an increase in inbreeding and a decrease in general fitness and adaptive potential. It ultimately raises the axolotl&#x27;s risk for extinction, something that they are already in danger of. Studies have found indicators of a low interpopulation gene flow and higher rates of genetic drift. These are likely the result of multiple “bottleneck” incidents in which events that kill off several individuals of a population occur and sharply reduce the genetic diversity of the remaining population. The offspring produced after bottleneck events have a greater risk of showing decreased fitness and are often less capable of adaptation down the line. Multiple bottleneck events can have disastrous effects on a population. Studies have also found high rates of relatedness that are indicative of inbreeding. Inbreeding can be especially harmful as it can cause an increase in the presence of deleterious, or harmful, genes within a population. The detection of introgressed tiger salamander (&quot;A. tigrinum&quot;) DNA in the laboratory axolotl population raises further concerns about the suitability of the captive population as an ark for potential reintroduction purposes.

There has been little improvement in the conditions of the lake or the population of native axolotls. Many scientists are focusing their conservation efforts on translocation of captive-bred individuals into new habitats or reintroduction into Lake Xochimilco. The Laboratorio de Restauracion Ecologica (LRE) in the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) has built up a population of more than 100 captive-bred individuals. These axolotls are mostly used for research by the lab but plans of a semi-artificial wetland inside the university have been established and the goal is to establish a viable population of axolotls within it. Studies have shown that captive-bred axolotls that are raised in a semi-natural environment can catch prey, survive in the wild, and have moderate success in escaping predators. These captive-bred individuals can be introduced into unpolluted bodies of water or back into Lake Xochimilco to establish or re-establish a wild population.

==Captive care==

 The axolotl is a popular exotic pet like its relative, the tiger salamander (&quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot;). As for all poikilothermic organisms, lower temperatures result in slower metabolism and a very unhealthily reduced appetite. Temperatures at approximately to are suggested for captive axolotls to ensure sufficient food intake; stress resulting from more than a day&#x27;s exposure to lower temperatures may quickly lead to disease and death, and temperatures higher than may lead to metabolic rate increase, also causing stress and eventually death. Chlorine, commonly added to tapwater, is harmful to axolotls. A single axolotl typically requires a tank. Axolotls spend the majority of the time at the bottom of the tank.

Salts, such as Holtfreter&#x27;s solution, are often added to the water to prevent infection.

In captivity, axolotls eat a variety of readily available foods, including trout and salmon pellets, frozen or live bloodworms, earthworms, and waxworms. Axolotls can also eat feeder fish, but care should be taken as fish may contain parasites.

Substrates are another important consideration for captive axolotls, as axolotls (like other amphibians and reptiles) tend to ingest bedding material together with food and are commonly prone to gastrointestinal obstruction and foreign body ingestion. Some common substrates used for animal enclosures can be harmful for amphibians and reptiles. Gravel (common in aquarium use) should not be used, and is recommended that any sand consists of smooth particles with a grain size of under 1mm. One guide to axolotl care for laboratories notes that bowel obstructions are a common cause of death, and recommends that no items with a diameter below 3 cm (or approximately the size of the animal&#x27;s head) should be available to the animal.

There is some evidence that axolotls might seek out appropriately-sized gravel for use as gastroliths based on experiments conducted at the University of Manitoba axolotl colony. As there is no conclusive evidence pointing to gastrolith use, gravel should be avoided due to the high risk of impaction.

== Cultural significance ==
The species is named after the Aztec deity Xolotl, the god of fire and lightning, who transformed himself into an axolotl to avoid being sacrificed by fellow gods. They continue to play an outsized cultural role in Mexico. Axólotl also means water monster in the Nahuatl language.

They appear in the works of Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. In 2021, Mexico released a new design for its 50-peso banknote featuring an axolotl along with maize and chinampas on its back. It was recognized as &quot;Bank Note of the Year&quot; by the International Bank Note Society. HD 224693, a star in the equatorial constellation of Cetus, was named Axólotl in 2019.

The Pokémon Mudkip and its evolutions, added in &quot;Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire&quot; (2002), take some visual inspiration from axolotls. Additionally, the Pokémon Wooper, added in &quot;Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal&quot; (1999), is directly based on an axolotl. The dragon Toothless in the &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; movies was modeled after axolotls as well. Following Mojang Studios&#x27; trend of adding endangered species to the game to raise awareness, axolotls were added to the video game &quot;Minecraft&quot; in 2020, and were included in its spin-offs &quot;Minecraft: Dungeons&quot; and &quot;Lego Minecraft&quot;. An anthropomorphic axolotl named Axo was added as a purchasable outfit in &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; on August 9, 2020.

<text>Acton Town is a London Underground station in the south-west corner of Acton, West London, in the London Borough of Ealing, close to its boundary with the London Borough of Hounslow. The station is served by the District and Piccadilly lines and is in Travelcard Zone 3. On the District line, the station is between Ealing Common and Chiswick Park stations, and on the Piccadilly line it is between Ealing Common (Uxbridge branch) or South Ealing (Heathrow branch) and Hammersmith (or Turnham Green in the early mornings and late evenings) stations.

Acton Town station was opened as Mill Hill Park on 1 July 1879 by the District Railway (now the District line). It remained as a terminus until on 1 May 1883 and 23 June 1903 the District Railway opened two branches from Acton Town to Hounslow Town and Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey respectively. On 4 July 1932 the Piccadilly line was extended to Acton Town. District line services to both the Hounslow and Uxbridge branches were withdrawn completely on 9 and 10 October 1964 after which operations were provided by the Piccadilly line alone.

The original brick-built station was built in 1879 and in February 1910 the station building was reconstructed. On 1 March 1910 the station was given its present name. In 1931 and 1932 the station was rebuilt again in preparation for transferring the Uxbridge branch service from the District line to the Piccadilly line. The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European geometric style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass.

==Location==

The station is at the junction of Gunnersbury Lane (A4000) and Bollo Lane. To the south-west of the station is the former Acton Works, central overhaul and engineering works for the London Underground. It is now home to the London Transport Museum&#x27;s reserve collection of rail and road vehicles (as known as London Transport Museum Depot or Museum Depot). The museum depot is opened to the public on a number of weekends throughout the year. To the north of the station is the District line&#x27;s Ealing Common Depot.

Frank Pick House is near the station, on Gunnersbury Lane. Named after Frank Pick, the London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s chief executive from 1933 to 1940, it is home to one of the engineering departments of the London Underground.

==History==

===District line===

====Hounslow and Uxbridge branches====
Acton Town station was opened as Mill Hill Park on 1 July 1879 by the District Railway (now the District line) on its extension from Turnham Green to Ealing Broadway. On 1 May 1883 the District Railway opened a branch from Acton Town to the now defunct Hounslow Town station, which developed into the Heathrow branch. On 23 June 1903 the District Railway tracks extended north of Acton Town to a new station at Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey which became the first of the Underground&#x27;s surface lines to use electric traction instead of steam with the Acton Town – Ealing Common section also electrified. The existing deep tube lines, (City and South London Railway, Waterloo &amp; City Railway (now Waterloo &amp; City line) and Central London Railway) had always been electrically powered. Services on the Hounslow branch (now the Heathrow branch) and to Central London were electrified on 13 June 1905 and 1 July 1905 respectively.

====South Acton branch====

On 13 June 1905, a passenger service began on the short branch to South Acton. A short fifth platform for the single car train of the South Acton branch was provided to the north of the eastbound island platform. At first the service ran to Hounslow West and to Uxbridge but it was later reduced to a shuttle between Acton Town and South Acton on 15 February 1932. The South Acton branch was closed on 28 February 1959 due to low usage; its platform at Acton Town has not been removed and is still visible. Much of the branch remains including a bridge support on the south side of Bollo Lane. In the picture, the area behind the hoarding in the background is the location of the former branch platform (Platform 5) which was only ever very short, two carriages at most. Part of a dismantled bridge where the shuttle crossed Bollo Lane remains near the entrance to Acton Works

===Piccadilly line===
On 4 July 1932, the Piccadilly line was extended west from its original terminus at Hammersmith and shared the route with the District line to Ealing Common. From Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line was replaced by the Piccadilly line, and from that date, District line trains from Acton Town ran only either to Hounslow West or to Ealing Broadway. On 9 January 1933 Piccadilly line trains, sharing with the District line, began serving Northfields on the Hounslow branch, and their service was extended to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933 but Piccadilly line trains did not call at South Ealing until 1935. District line services on the Hounslow branch were withdrawn on 9 and 10 October 1964 after which operations were provided by the Piccadilly line alone.

==Station building==
The original brick-built station was built in 1879. In February 1910 the station building was reconstructed and on 1 March 1910 the station was given its present name. In 1931 and 1932 the station was rebuilt again in preparation for transferring the Uxbridge branch service from the District line to the Piccadilly line. The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European geometric style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass.

As with other stations that Holden designed, Acton Town station features a tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure housing the station offices and shops. The ticket hall has a projecting London Underground roundel sign over a canopy, the brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof. From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.

The stated reason for why it should be listed was:

==Services and connections==

===Services===

Between Acton Town and Hammersmith, District line trains serve all stations, but Piccadilly line trains run non-stop to Hammersmith except for calling at Turnham Green at the start and end of the day. The run between Acton Town and Hammersmith spans nearly three miles – the longest distance between stops on the Piccadilly line. West of Acton Town, District line trains go via Ealing Common to Ealing Broadway and Piccadilly line trains run either via South Ealing to Heathrow, or via Ealing Common to Uxbridge.

====District line====
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*6tph eastbound to Upminster (Barking on Sundays)
*6tph westbound to Ealing Broadway

There is also a morning service every day from Acton Town (Ealing Broadway on Saturdays) to Edgware Road and a late evening service from Edgware Road to Ealing Broadway on Sundays only.

====Piccadilly line====
Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 2–5 minutes eastbound, Off-Peak = 3 tph to Uxbridge and 3 tph to Rayners Lane, Peak = 6 tph to Uxbridge and 6 tph to Rayners Lane, and every 2–7 minutes westbound to Heathrow Terminal 2 &amp; 3 and Terminal 5 or via the Heathrow Terminal 4 loop. Since 16 December 2016, Acton Town is also served by Night Tube trains between Cockfosters and Heathrow Terminal 5.

During occasional closures on the District line, the Piccadilly line provides additional services to serve destinations on the District line such as Ealing Broadway. This is done either by diverting some trains bound for Rayners Lane and Uxbridge, or as a shuttle from Acton Town. Also, Piccadilly line trains may also run on the District line tracks between Hammersmith and Acton Town to serve the District line stations with no platforms on the Piccadilly line, namely Ravenscourt Park, Stamford Brook, Turnham Green and Chiswick Park.

===Connections===
London Buses routes 70, E3 and night route N11 serve the station.

== Incidents ==
On 25 March 1993, a woman named Jean Bradley was stabbed to death by a man after leaving Acton Town tube station. The notorious murder still remains unsolved.

On Tuesday, 1 February 2022, a large fire occurred at the Autocar Centre, a garage adjacent to the now-abandoned Platform 5 is, which subsequently caused the evacuation of the station and &quot;severe delays&quot; to the District line and Piccadilly line. 10 fire engines and 70 firefighters were sent to the scene after being called at 5:10 PM and stayed there until late at night, bringing the fire under control. The cause of the fire is not yet known, but will be investigated by the LFB. Since the fire, witnesses in the area have described the roof as burned and partially caved in, though the damage to the abandoned Platform 5 itself is unknown.

<text>Baker Street is a London Underground station at the junction of Baker Street and the Marylebone Road in the City of Westminster. It is one of the original stations of the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world&#x27;s first underground railway, opened on 10 January 1863.

The station is in Travelcard Zone 1 and is served by five lines. On the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines the station is between Edgware Road and Great Portland Street stations, and on the Metropolitan line it is between Finchley Road and Great Portland Street stations. On the Bakerloo line the station is between Marylebone and Regent&#x27;s Park stations, and on the Jubilee line it is between St John&#x27;s Wood and Bond Street stations.

== Location ==

The station has entrances on Baker Street, Chiltern Street (ticket holders only) and Marylebone Road. Nearby attractions include Regent&#x27;s Park, Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, the Sherlock Holmes Museum and Madame Tussauds.

== History ==
=== Metropolitan Railway – the world&#x27;s first underground railway ===
In the first half of the 19th century, the population and physical extent of London grew greatly. The congested streets and the distance to the city from the stations to the north and west prompted many attempts to get parliamentary approval to build new railway lines into the city. In 1852, Charles Pearson planned a railway from Farringdon to King&#x27;s Cross. Although the plan was supported by the city, the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed. The Bayswater, Paddington, and Holborn Bridge Railway Company was established to connect the Great Western Railway&#x27;s (GWR) Paddington station to Pearson&#x27;s route at King&#x27;s Cross. A bill was published in November 1852 and in January 1853 the directors held their first meeting and appointed John Fowler as its engineer. Several bills were submitted for a route between Paddington and Farringdon. The company&#x27;s name was also to be changed again, to Metropolitan Railway and the route was approved on 7 August 1854.

Construction began in March 1860; using the &quot;cut-and-cover&quot; method to dig the tunnel. Despite several accidents during construction, work was complete by the end of 1862 at a cost of £1.3 million. Rail services through the station opened to the public on Saturday, 10 January 1863.

In the next few years, extensions of the line were made at both ends with connections from Paddington to the GWR&#x27;s Hammersmith and City Railway (H&amp;CR) and at Gloucester Road to the District Railway (DR). From 1871, the MR and the DR operated a joint &quot;Inner Circle&quot; service between Mansion House and Moorgate Street.

==== North-western &quot;branch&quot; ====
In April 1868, the Metropolitan &amp; St John&#x27;s Wood Railway (M&amp;SJWR) opened a single-track railway in tunnel to Swiss Cottage from new platforms at Baker Street East (which eventually become the present Metropolitan line platforms). The line was worked by the MR with a train every 20 minutes. A junction was built with the original route at Baker Street, but there were no through trains after 1869.

The M&amp;SJWR branch was extended in 1879 to Willesden Green and, in 1880, to Neasden and Harrow-on-the-Hill. Two years later, the single-track tunnel between Baker Street and Swiss Cottage was duplicated and the M&amp;SJWR was absorbed by the MR.

=== Bakerloo and Jubilee lines ===

In November 1891, a private bill was presented to Parliament for the construction of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Marylebone to Elephant &amp; Castle via Baker Street and Waterloo and was approved in 1900. Construction commenced in August 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker, W. R. Galbraith and R. F. Church with building work by Perry &amp; Company of Tredegar Works, Bow. Test trains began running in 1905. The official opening of the BS&amp;WR by Sir Edwin Cornwall took place on 10 March 1906. The first section of the BS&amp;WR was between Baker Street and Lambeth North. Baker Street was the temporary northern terminus of the line until it was extended to Marylebone on 27 March 1907, a year after the rest of the line. The BS&amp;WR&#x27;s station building designed by Leslie Green stood on Baker Street and served the tube platforms with lifts, but these were supplemented with escalators in 1914, linking the Metropolitan line and the Bakerloo line platforms by a new concourse excavated under the Metropolitan line. An elaborately decorated restaurant and tea-room was added above Green&#x27;s terminal building, the Chiltern Court Restaurant, which was opened in 1913.

On 1 July 1933, the MR and BS&amp;WR amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), and the MR became the Metropolitan line, while the BS&amp;WR became the Bakerloo line of London Transport. However, there was a bottleneck on the Metropolitan line at Finchley Road where four tracks merge into two to Baker Street. LPTB decided to extend the Bakerloo line from Baker Street as a branch line, taking over the existing section between Finchley Road and Stanmore. Construction began in April 1936. On 20 November 1939, following the construction of an additional southbound platform and connecting tube tunnels between Baker Street and Finchley Road stations, the Bakerloo line took over the Metropolitan line&#x27;s stopping services between Finchley Road and Wembley Park and its Stanmore branch.
 The current Bakerloo ticket hall and escalators to the lower concourse were provided in conjunction with the new service.

After the Victoria line had been completed in the 1960s, the new Jubilee line was proposed which would take a route via Baker Street, Bond Street, Trafalgar Square, Strand, Fleet Street, Ludgate Circus and Cannon Street, then proceeding into southeast London. This new line was to have been called the Fleet line. The Jubilee line added an extra northbound platform and took over the Bakerloo line service between Stanmore and Baker Street, opening on 1 May 1979.

=== Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines ===
The initial route on the Hammersmith &amp; City line was formed by the H&amp;CR, running between Hammersmith and Moorgate. Services were eventually extended to Barking via the DR and shared with the existing MR tracks between Baker Street and Liverpool Street. The route between Hammersmith and Barking was shown on the tube map as part of the Metropolitan line, but since 1990 has been shown separately, the Metropolitan line becoming the route from Aldgate to Baker Street and northwards through &quot;Metro-Land&quot; to Uxbridge, Watford and Amersham.

The circle line was initially formed by the combination of the MR and DR routes, which were between Edgware Road and South Kensington, Edgware Road and Aldgate via King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, South Kensington and Mansion House, and a joint railway between Mansion House and Aldgate. Since 1949, the Circle line is shown separately on the map.

=== Incidents ===
On 18 June 1925, electric locomotive No.4 collided with a passenger train when a signal was changed from green to red just as the locomotive was passing it. Six people were injured.

On 23 August 1973, a bomb was found in a carrier bag in the ticket hall. The bomb was defused by the bomb squad. A week later, on 30 August, a member of staff found another bomb left on the overbridge. Again, it was defused without any injury.

== The station today ==
Baker Street station is the combination of three separate stations, with several booking offices throughout its operational years. There were major changes in 1891–93 and 1910–12. The first part is the Metropolitan line station, whose two platforms are now used by the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. They are situated on a roughly east-to-west alignment beneath Marylebone Road, spanning approximately the stretch between Upper Baker Street and Allsop Place. This was part of the original Metropolitan Railway from Bishop&#x27;s Road (now Paddington (Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines) station to Farringdon Street (now Farringdon) which opened on 10 January 1863.

The platforms serving the main branch of the Metropolitan line towards Harrow and beyond are located within the triangle formed by Marylebone Road, Upper Baker Street and Allsop Place, following the alignment of Allsop Place. This station is the second section which was opened on 13 April 1868 by the Metropolitan &amp; St. John&#x27;s Wood Railway. This was later absorbed by the Metropolitan Railway, which is usually known to them as Baker Street East station.

The final section is the deep-level tube station of the Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway (now part of the Bakerloo line), situated at a lower level beneath the site of Baker Street East, opened on 10 March 1906. This part of the station now contains four platforms, two each for the Bakerloo and Jubilee lines.

This station is a terminus for some Metropolitan line trains, but there is also a connecting curve that joins to the Circle line just beyond the platforms, allowing Metropolitan line through services to run to Aldgate. The deep-level Bakerloo and Jubilee lines platforms are arranged in a cross-platform interchange layout and there are track connections between the two lines just to the north of the station. Access to the Bakerloo and Jubilee lines is only via escalators.

With ten platforms overall, Baker Street has the most amount of London Underground platforms of any station on the network. Since Swiss Cottage and St John&#x27;s Wood have replaced the former three stations between Finchley Road and Baker Street on the Metropolitan line, it takes an average of five and a half minutes to travel between them. Essentially, the Metropolitan Line operates as a fast service while the Jubilee Line offers local service between the two stations.

As part of the Transported by Design programme of activities, on 15 October 2015, after two months of public voting, Baker Street underground station&#x27;s platforms were elected by Londoners as one of the 10 favourite transport design icons.

The former Chiltern Court Restaurant above the station is still in use today as the Metropolitan Bar, part of the Wetherspoons pub chain. The rest of the block, known as Chiltern Court and completed by the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s in-house architect, Charles Walter Clark in 1929, houses residential apartments.

=== Sub-surface platforms ===

One of the MR&#x27;s original stations, now the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City line platforms 5 and 6 are the best preserved dating from the station&#x27;s opening in 1863. Plaques of the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s coat of arms along the platform and old plans and photographs depict the station which has changed remarkably little in over a hundred and fifty years. Restoration work in the 1980s on the oldest portions of Baker Street station brought it back to something similar to its 1863 appearance.

The Metropolitan line platforms 1 to 4 were largely the result of the station&#x27;s rebuild in the 1920s to cater for the increase in traffic on its outer suburban routes. Today, the basic layout remains the same with platforms 2 and 3 being through tracks for City services to Aldgate from Amersham, Chesham, Uxbridge or Watford and vice versa flanked by terminal platforms 1 and 4 which are the domain of services from Baker Street to Amersham, Chesham, Uxbridge or Watford and vice versa. The northern end of the platforms is in a cutting being surrounded by Chiltern Court and Selbie House the latter of which houses Baker Street control centre responsible for signalling the Metropolitan line from Preston Road to Aldgate, as well as the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines between Baker Street and Aldgate. The southern end of the platforms are situated in a cut and cover tunnel which runs towards Great Portland Street. All Metropolitan line platforms can function as terminating tracks however under normal circumstance only dead ended platforms 1 and 4 are used as such.

=== Deep-level tube platforms ===
The Bakerloo line uses platforms 8 and 9, which date from 10 March 1906 when the Baker Street &amp; Waterloo railway opened between here and Lambeth North (then called Kennington Road). The contraction of the name to &quot;Bakerloo&quot; rapidly caught on, and the official name was changed to match in July 1906.

By the mid-1930s, the Metropolitan line was suffering from congestion caused by the limited capacity of its tracks between Baker Street and Finchley Road stations. To relieve this pressure, the network-wide &quot;New Works Programme, 1935–1940&quot; included the construction of new sections of tunnel between the Bakerloo line&#x27;s platforms at Baker Street and Finchley Road and the replacement of three Metropolitan line stations (Lord&#x27;s, Marlborough Road and Swiss Cottage) between those points with two new Bakerloo line stations (St John&#x27;s Wood and Swiss Cottage). The Bakerloo line also took over the Metropolitan line&#x27;s service to Stanmore on 20 November 1939. The branch remained part of the Bakerloo line until 1 May 1979, when similar congestion problems for the Bakerloo line caused by the two branches converging at Baker Street led to the opening of the Jubilee line, initially created by connecting the Stanmore branch to new tunnels bored between Baker Street and Charing Cross. Following refurbishment in the 1980s the original tiling scheme was replaced with tiles depicting the silhouette of Sherlock Holmes, who lived at 221B Baker Street.

The Bakerloo line still maintains its connection with the now Jubilee line tracks to Stanmore, with tunnels linking from Bakerloo line northbound platform 9 to Jubilee line northbound platform 10 towards St John&#x27;s Wood and from Jubilee line southbound platform 7 to Bakerloo line southbound platform 8 towards Regent&#x27;s Park. Although no passenger services operate over these sections they can be used for the transfer of engineering trains and were used to transfer Bakerloo line 1972 stock trains to and from Acton Works as part of a refurbishment programme.

The Jubilee line uses platforms 7 and 10. Platform 7 was already in use for southbound trains from the Stanmore branch, and Platform 10 opened in 1979 when the newly built Jubilee line took over the existing Bakerloo line services to Stanmore running through new tunnels from Baker Street to Charing Cross to serve as a relief line to the Bakerloo, which by then was suffering from capacity issues. In 1999, the Jubilee line was extended from Green Park to Stratford, making the Jubilee line platforms at Charing Cross redundant after twenty years. The design of the Jubilee line platforms at Baker Street has changed little since being opened, with illustrations depicting famous scenes from Sherlock Holmes cases.

Cross-platform interchange is provided between the four platforms of both the Bakerloo and Jubilee lines in both directions.

=== Station improvements ===

==== Step-free access project ====
In 2008 TfL proposed a project to provide step-free access to the sub-surface platforms. The project was a TfL-funded Games-enabling project in its investment programme (and not a project specifically funded as a result of the success of the London 2012 Games bid). The project was included in the strategy on accessible transport published by the London 2012 Olympic Delivery Authority and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Access to the Metropolitan line platforms 1–4 (serving trains to and from Finchley Road) would be provided by a bridge from the Bakerloo and Jubilee line ticket hall, with a lift from the bridge to each island platform. Through a passage from platforms 1–2, this would also give step-free access to platform 5 (Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City line eastbound trains). Access to platform 6 (Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City line westbound trains) would be provided by demolishing the triangular building outside the station, on the north side of Marylebone Road, and taking over the public pedestrian subway under Marylebone Road to provide a link between a lift up from platform 5 to the subway and a lift at the other end of the subway down to platform 6. The replacement for the triangular building would also act as an emergency exit for the station.

TfL applied for planning permission and listed building consent for providing access to platforms 5 and 6 on 1 October 2008, but the application was subsequently withdrawn. (The part of the proposed scheme to provide step-free access to platforms 1–4 is within TfL&#x27;s permitted development rights, and so does not require planning permission.) TfL announced on 31 March 2009 that because of budgetary constraints the step-free scheme would be deferred.

==== Platform lengthening ====
In order to accommodate the new, longer S stock trains, which started operating Metropolitan line services in August 2010, platforms 1 and 4 have been extended. However, the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City line platforms 5 and 6 have not been extended to accommodate their new S7 Stock trains, due to the enclosed nature of the platforms. Instead, selective door operation is employed.

<doc id="235596" wikidata="Q2915008" url="?curid=235596" title="Association fallacy">
<text>The association fallacy is a formal fallacy that asserts that properties of one thing must also be properties of another thing if both things belong to the same group. For example, a fallacious arguer may claim that &quot;bears are animals, and bears are dangerous; therefore your dog, which is also an animal, must be dangerous.&quot;

When it is an attempt to win favor by exploiting the audience&#x27;s preexisting spite or disdain for something else, it is called guilt by association or an appeal to spite (). Guilt by association is similar to ad hominem arguments which attack the speaker rather than addressing the claims, but in this case the ill feeling is not created by the argument; it already exists.

== Formal version ==

Using the language of set theory, the formal fallacy can be written as follows:
:Premise: A is in set S1
:Premise: A is in set S2
:Premise: B is also in set S2
:Conclusion: Therefore, B is in set S1.

In the notation of first-order logic, this type of fallacy can be expressed as (∃&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot; : &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) ⇒ (∀&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot; : &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)).

The fallacy in the argument can be illustrated through the use of an Euler diagram: A satisfies the requirement that it is part of both sets S1 and S2, but representing this as an Euler diagram makes it clear that B could be in S2 but not S1.

== Guilt by association ==
This form of the argument is as follows:
* Group A makes a particular claim.
* Group B, which is currently viewed negatively by some, makes the same claim as Group A.
* Therefore, Group A is viewed as associated with Group B, and is now also viewed negatively.

An example of this fallacy would be &quot;My opponent for office just received an endorsement from the Puppy Haters Association. Is that the sort of person you would want to vote for?&quot;

=== Examples ===
Some syllogistic examples of guilt by association:

* John is a Con artist. John has black hair. Therefore, people with black hair are necessarily Con artists.
* Lyle is a crooked salesman. Lyle proposes a monorail. Therefore, the proposed monorail is necessarily .
* Country X is a dangerous country. Country X has a national postal service. Therefore, countries with national postal services are necessarily dangerous.
* Simon and Karl live in Nashville, and they are both petty criminals. Jill lives in Nashville; therefore, Jill is necessarily a petty criminal.
Guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of &quot;ad hominem&quot;, if the argument attacks a person because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.

== Galileo gambit ==
A form of the association fallacy often used by those denying a well-established scientific or historical proposition is the so-called Galileo gambit or Galileo fallacy. The argument runs thus: Galileo was ridiculed in his time for his scientific observations, but was later acknowledged to be right; the proponent argues that since their non-mainstream views are provoking ridicule and rejection from other scientists, they will later be recognized as correct, like Galileo. The gambit is flawed in that being ridiculed does not necessarily correlate with being right and that many people who have been ridiculed in history were, in fact, wrong. Similarly, Carl Sagan opined that people laughed at such geniuses as Christopher Columbus and the Wright brothers, but &quot;they also laughed at Bozo the Clown&quot;. It is often committed by those whose theories reject common scientific consensus.

<text>Ju Sigyeong (; December 22, 1876 – July 27, 1914) was one of the founders of modern Korean linguistics. He was born in Pongsan-gun, Hwanghae Province in 1876. He helped to standardize the Korean language, based on the spelling and grammar of vernacular Korean.

==Biography==
Ju Sigyeong was born in Hwanghae Province, in what is now North Korea. He studied Classical Chinese from an early age. In 1887 he moved to Seoul and studied linguistics. In 1896, he found work in the first Hangeul-only newspaper, &quot;Dongnip Sinmun&quot;, founded by the Korean independence activist Seo Jae-pil. In 1897, Seo Jae-pil was sent into exile to the United States, and Ju Sigyeong left the newspaper.

Interested in Western linguistics and teaching methods, Ju Sigyeong served as a Korean instructor for the American missionary William B. Scranton, founder of today&#x27;s Ewha Womans University.

==Standardizing Korean Language==
Having realized the need of a standardized Korean alphabet, Ju Sigyeong established the Korean Language System Society () in 1886 along with several of his colleagues. Ju also hosted several seminars in the National Language Discussion Centre of the Sangdong Youth Academy of the Korean language ().

Ju proposed that the Korean parts of speech include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, unconjugated adjectives (), auxiliaries (), conjunctions, s, and sentence-final particles (). Ju Sigyeong coined the name &quot;Hangul&quot; () between 1910 and 1913 to identify the Korean writing system, which had previously existed under several other names, such as &quot;eonmun&quot; (, vernacular script), since the 15th century.

In his 1914 publication, &quot;Sounds of the Language&quot; (), he promoted writing Hangul linearly rather than syllabically. This is one of his few proposals not to have been implemented in modern Korean linguistics, although there have been experiments with linear Hangul, most notably in Primorsky Krai.

<text>Malaysia is a federal constitutional monarchy located in Southeast Asia. It is a relatively state-oriented and newly industrialised market economy. 

The state plays a significant but declining role in guiding economic activity through macroeconomic plans. In 2014, Malaysia&#x27;s economy grew 6%, the second highest growth in ASEAN behind Philippines&#x27; growth of 6.1%. The economy of Malaysia (GDP PPP) in 2014 was $746.821 billion, the third largest in ASEAN behind Indonesia and Thailand and the 28th largest in the world.

<text>An animated series is a set of animated television works with a common title, usually related to one another. These episodes typically share the same main heroes, some different secondary characters and a basic theme. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a miniseries, a definite end, or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes. They can be broadcast on television, shown in movie theaters, released on the internet or direct-to-video. Like other creative works, animated series can be of a wide variety of genres and can also have different target audiences: both males and females, both children and adults.

==Television==

Animated television series are presented daily or on certain days of the week during a prescribed time slot, including for example saturday-morning cartoons, prime time cartoons, late night anime, and weekday cartoons; series broadcast only on weekends.

The duration of an episode also varies. Traditionally, they are produced as complete half-hour or nearly half-hour programs; however, many are presented as animated shorts of 10 — 11 minutes, which can be combined for filling a set time period in &quot;segments&quot;, including several such shorts. When advertising is taken into account, the cartoon itself may be only 15 — 20 minutes of the half hour, although Netflix and many other streaming companies do not show commercials. There are also series with very short episodes lasting approximately five minutes; they have recently become more common in Japanese animation.

If a local station of a television network broadcasts an animated series as a part of its own programming, the time-slot will vary by region.

All early animated television series, the first being &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; (1950 — 1959), are comic cartoon series. However, later series include sports (&quot;Speed Racer&quot;, &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot;, &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;), action (&quot;Hajime no Ippo&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;), science fiction (&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, &quot;Tenchi Muyo&quot;), drama (&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;), adventure (&quot;Dragon Ball&quot;), martial arts (&quot;Baki the Grappler&quot;), and other genres.

The first animated sitcom was &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1960 — 1966), produced by Hanna-Barbera. It was followed by other sitcoms of this studio: &quot;Top Cat&quot; (1961 — 1962), &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; (1964 — 1965), &quot;The Jetsons&quot; (1962 — 1963, 1985, 1987) and &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot; (1972 — 1974), an adult-oriented animated series in the style of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; from Ross Bagdasarian Sr. and &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot; from Bob Clampett are also sitcoms.

===Broadcast network===
The 1980s and 1990s were a renaissance of the animated children and adult television series. Various broadcast networks and media companies began creating television channels and formats designed specifically for airing cartoon and anime series. Companies that already had these types of formats in place began to revamp their existing models during this time. Most of this animations were American-based or Japanese anime. Listed below are examples of television networks and channels that include animated programs.

American
* Fox
* Discovery Family
* Nickelodeon
* Nick Jr. Channel
* TeenNick
* MTV
* Comedy Central
* Disney Channel
* Disney XD
* Disney Jr.
* Universal Kids
* PBS Kids

British
* CITV
* CBeebies
* CBBC
* Pop
* Tiny Pop

Japanese
* TV Tokyo
* Kids Station
* Tokyo MX

Canadian
* Treehouse TV
Australian
* ABC Kids

Examples of animation-focused networks and channels are listed below; but some of them aired live-action programs occasionally.

American
* Cartoon Network
** Cartoonito
** Adult Swim
* Boomerang
* Nicktoons

South Korean
* Tooniverse
* Aniplus
* 

Canadian
* Cartoon Network
* YTV

Japanese
* AT-X

During the 1990s, more mature content than those of traditional cartoon series began to appear more widely, extending beyond a primary audience of children. These cartoon series included &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, and &quot;Duckman&quot;. Canadian computer-animated series &quot;ReBoot&quot;, which began as a child-friendly show, shifted its target group to ages 12 and up, resulting in a darker and more mature storyline.

==Film theatrical==

Animated film theatrical series include all early animated series: &quot;Animated Weekly&quot; (1913), &quot;The Newlyweds&quot; (1913 — 1915), &quot;Travelaughs&quot; (1913, 1915 — 1918, 1921 — 1923), &quot;Doc Yak&quot; (1913 — 1915), &quot;Colonel Heeza Liar&quot; (1913 — 1917, 1922 — 1924), &quot;&quot; (1916 — 1922), &quot;Les Aventures des Pieds Nickelés&quot; (1917 — 1918), the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon short films released in movie theaters from 1940 to 1967, and many others.

==Direct-to-video==

Direct-to-video animated series include most Japanese original video animations (OVAs). The first OVA series (and also the first overall OVA) was &quot;Dallos&quot; (1983 — 1985). Almost all hentai (pornographic) anime series are released as OVAs.

==Web series==
Animated web series are designed and produced for streaming services. Examples include &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot; (1999 — 2023) and &quot;Eddsworld&quot; (2003 — present).

They can also be released on YouTube, such as Asdfmovie, which debuted in 2008.

<doc id="235619" wikidata="Q4926665" url="?curid=235619" title="Blind thrust earthquake">
<text>A blind thrust earthquake occurs along a thrust fault that does not show signs on the Earth&#x27;s surface, hence the designation &quot;blind&quot;. Such faults, being invisible at the surface, have not been mapped by standard surface geological mapping. Sometimes they are discovered as a by-product of oil exploration seismology; in other cases their existence is not suspected.

Although such earthquakes are not amongst the most energetic, they are sometimes the most destructive, as conditions combine to form an urban earthquake which greatly affects urban seismic risk.

A blind thrust earthquake is quite close, in meaning, to a buried rupture earthquake, if a buried rupture earthquake is not specifically about the fault, but signs the earthquake leaves, on the Earth&#x27;s surface.

==Blind thrust faults==
Blind thrust faults generally exist near tectonic plate margins, in the broad disturbance zone. They form when a section of the Earth&#x27;s crust is under high compressive stresses, due to plate margin collision, or the general geometry of how the plates are sliding past each other.
As shown in the diagram, a weak plate under compression generally forms thrusting sheets, or overlapping sliding sections. This can form a hill and valley landform, with the hills being the strong sections, and the valleys being the highly disturbed thrust faulted and folded sections. After a long period of erosion the visible landscape may be flattened, with material eroded from the hills filling up the valleys and hiding the underlying hill-and-valley geology. The valley rock is very weak and usually highly weathered, presenting deep, fertile soil; naturally, this is the area that becomes populated. Reflection seismology profiles show the disturbed rock that hides a blind thrust fault.

If the region is under active compression these faults are constantly rupturing, but any given valley might only experience a large earthquake every few hundred years. Although usually of magnitude 6 to 7 compared to the largest magnitude 9 earthquakes of recent times, such a temblor is especially destructive because the seismic waves are highly directed, and the soft basin soil of the valley can amplify the ground motions tenfold or more.

==Examples of occurrence==

===Some known faults===
* Los Angeles, California, USA, has many earthquakes and is well-studied. In addition to surface faults, a number of blind-thrust faults have been found under the basin and metropolitan area. A NASA study which combined satellite radar images and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations found that &quot;tectonic squeezing across Los Angeles&quot; &quot;will likely produce earthquakes on either the blind Elysian Park or Puente Hills thrust fault systems&quot;. A blind thrust earthquake along the Puente Hills fault could contribute more to urban seismic risk than the &#x27;big ones&#x27; of magnitude 8 or more.
* Bajo Segura Fault Zone, Spain
* Fukaya Fault System, Japan (near Tokyo)
* Uemachi Fault System, Osaka Basin, Japan
* Main Frontal Thrust, Himalaya

<text>In statistics, Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient or Spearman&#x27;s &quot;ρ&quot;, named after Charles Spearman and often denoted by the Greek letter formula_1 (rho) or as formula_2, is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.

The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson&#x27;s correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman&#x27;s correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.

Intuitively, the Spearman correlation between two variables will be high when observations have a similar (or identical for a correlation of 1) rank (i.e. relative position label of the observations within the variable: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) between the two variables, and low when observations have a dissimilar (or fully opposed for a correlation of −1) rank between the two variables.

Spearman&#x27;s coefficient is appropriate for both continuous and discrete ordinal variables. Both Spearman&#x27;s formula_1 and Kendall&#x27;s formula_4 can be formulated as special cases of a more general correlation coefficient.

== Applications ==

The coefficient can be used to determine how well data fits a model, like when determining the similarity of text documents.

== Definition and calculation ==
The Spearman correlation coefficient is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the rank variables.

For a sample of size formula_5 the formula_6 pairs of raw scores formula_7 are converted to ranks formula_8 and formula_9 is computed as

: formula_10

where
: formula_11 denotes the conventional Pearson correlation coefficient operator, but applied to the rank variables,
: formula_12 is the covariance of the rank variables,
: formula_13 and formula_14 are the standard deviations of the rank variables.

Only when all formula_6 ranks are &quot;distinct integers&quot; (no ties), it can be computed using the popular formula

: formula_16

where
: formula_17 is the difference between the two ranks of each observation,
: formula_6 is the number of observations.

Consider a bivariate sample formula_19 with corresponding rank pairs formula_20
Then the Spearman correlation coefficient of formula_21 is

:formula_22

where, as usual,
: formula_23
: formula_24
: formula_25
and
: formula_26

We shall show that formula_27 can be expressed purely in terms of
formula_28
provided we assume that there be no ties within each sample.

Under this assumption, we have that formula_29 can be viewed as random variables
distributed like a uniformly distributed discrete random variable, formula_30 on formula_31
Hence
formula_32
and
formula_33
where
: formula_34
: formula_35
and thus
: formula_36
(These sums can be computed using the formulas for the triangular numbers and square pyramidal numbers, or basic summation results from umbral calculus.)

Observe now that

:formula_37

Putting this all together thus yields

:formula_38
Identical values are usually each assigned fractional ranks equal to the average of their positions in the ascending order of the values, which is equivalent to averaging over all possible permutations.

If ties are present in the data set, the simplified formula above yields incorrect results: Only if in both variables all ranks are distinct, then formula_39formula_40formula_41formula_42 (calculated according to biased variance).
The first equation — normalizing by the standard deviation — may be used even when ranks are normalized to [0, 1] (&quot;relative ranks&quot;) because it is insensitive both to translation and linear scaling.
The simplified method should also not be used in cases where the data set is truncated; that is, when the Spearman&#x27;s correlation coefficient is desired for the top &quot;X&quot; records (whether by pre-change rank or post-change rank, or both), the user should use the Pearson correlation coefficient formula given above.

==Related quantities==
There are several other numerical measures that quantify the extent of statistical dependence between pairs of observations. The most common of these is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, which is a similar correlation method to Spearman&#x27;s rank, that measures the “linear” relationships between the raw numbers rather than between their ranks.

An alternative name for the Spearman rank correlation is the “grade correlation”; in this, the “rank” of an observation is replaced by the “grade”. In continuous distributions, the grade of an observation is, by convention, always one half less than the rank, and hence the grade and rank correlations are the same in this case. More generally, the “grade” of an observation is proportional to an estimate of the fraction of a population less than a given value, with the half-observation adjustment at observed values. Thus this corresponds to one possible treatment of tied ranks. While unusual, the term “grade correlation” is still in use.

==Interpretation==
The sign of the Spearman correlation indicates the direction of association between &quot;X&quot; (the independent variable) and &quot;Y&quot; (the dependent variable). If &quot;Y&quot; tends to increase when &quot;X&quot; increases, the Spearman correlation coefficient is positive. If &quot;Y&quot; tends to decrease when &quot;X&quot; increases, the Spearman correlation coefficient is negative. A Spearman correlation of zero indicates that there is no tendency for &quot;Y&quot; to either increase or decrease when &quot;X&quot; increases. The Spearman correlation increases in magnitude as &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; become closer to being perfectly monotonic functions of each other. When &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are perfectly monotonically related, the Spearman correlation coefficient becomes 1. A perfectly monotonic increasing relationship implies that for any two pairs of data values and , that and always have the same sign. A perfectly monotonic decreasing relationship implies that these differences always have opposite signs.

The Spearman correlation coefficient is often described as being &quot;nonparametric&quot;. This can have two meanings. First, a perfect Spearman correlation results when &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are related by any monotonic function. Contrast this with the Pearson correlation, which only gives a perfect value when &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are related by a &quot;linear&quot; function. The other sense in which the Spearman correlation is nonparametric is that its exact sampling distribution can be obtained without requiring knowledge (i.e., knowing the parameters) of the joint probability distribution of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.

==Example==
In this example, the arbitrary raw data in the table below is used to calculate the correlation between the IQ of a person with the number of hours spent in front of TV per week [fictitious values used].
Firstly, evaluate formula_43. To do so use the following steps, reflected in the table below.
# Sort the data by the first column (formula_44). Create a new column formula_45 and assign it the ranked values 1, 2, 3, ..., &quot;n&quot;.
# Next, sort the augmented (with formula_45) data by the second column (formula_47). Create a fourth column formula_48 and similarly assign it the ranked values 1, 2, 3, ..., &quot;n&quot;.
# Create a fifth column formula_49 to hold the differences between the two rank columns (formula_45 and formula_48).
# Create one final column formula_43 to hold the value of column formula_49 squared.

With formula_43 found, add them to find formula_55. The value of &quot;n&quot; is 10. These values can now be substituted back into the equation

: formula_56

to give

: formula_57

which evaluates to with a &quot;p&quot;-value = 0.627188 (using the &quot;t&quot;-distribution).
That the value is close to zero shows that the correlation between IQ and hours spent watching TV is very low, although the negative value suggests that the longer the time spent watching television the lower the IQ. In the case of ties in the original values, this formula should not be used; instead, the Pearson correlation coefficient should be calculated on the ranks (where ties are given ranks, as described above).

==Confidence intervals==
Confidence intervals for Spearman&#x27;s &quot;ρ&quot; can be easily obtained using the Jackknife Euclidean likelihood approach in de Carvalho and Marques (2012). The confidence interval with level formula_58 is based on a Wilks&#x27; theorem given in the latter paper, and is given by

: formula_59

where formula_60 is the formula_58 quantile of a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom, and the formula_62 are jackknife pseudo-values. This approach is implemented in the R package spearmanCI.

==Determining significance==
One approach to test whether an observed value of &quot;ρ&quot; is significantly different from zero (&quot;r&quot; will always maintain ) is to calculate the probability that it would be greater than or equal to the observed &quot;r&quot;, given the null hypothesis, by using a permutation test. An advantage of this approach is that it automatically takes into account the number of tied data values in the sample and the way they are treated in computing the rank correlation.

Another approach parallels the use of the Fisher transformation in the case of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. That is, confidence intervals and hypothesis tests relating to the population value &quot;ρ&quot; can be carried out using the Fisher transformation:

: formula_63

If &quot;F&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is the Fisher transformation of &quot;r&quot;, the sample Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and &quot;n&quot; is the sample size, then

: formula_64

is a &quot;z&quot;-score for &quot;r&quot;, which approximately follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis of statistical independence ().

One can also test for significance using

: formula_65

which is distributed approximately as Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution with degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis. A justification for this result relies on a permutation argument.

A generalization of the Spearman coefficient is useful in the situation where there are three or more conditions, a number of subjects are all observed in each of them, and it is predicted that the observations will have a particular order. For example, a number of subjects might each be given three trials at the same task, and it is predicted that performance will improve from trial to trial. A test of the significance of the trend between conditions in this situation was developed by E. B. Page and is usually referred to as Page&#x27;s trend test for ordered alternatives.

== Correspondence analysis based on Spearman&#x27;s &quot;ρ&quot; ==
Classic correspondence analysis is a statistical method that gives a score to every value of two nominal variables. In this way the Pearson correlation coefficient between them is maximized.

There exists an equivalent of this method, called grade correspondence analysis, which maximizes Spearman&#x27;s &quot;ρ&quot; or Kendall&#x27;s τ.

== Approximating Spearman&#x27;s &quot;ρ&quot; from a stream ==
There are two existing approaches to approximating the Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient from streaming data. The first approach
involves coarsening the joint distribution of formula_66. For continuous formula_67 values: formula_68 cutpoints are selected for formula_69 and formula_70 respectively, discretizing
these random variables. Default cutpoints are added at formula_71 and formula_72. A count matrix of size formula_73, denoted formula_74, is then constructed where formula_75 stores the number of observations that
fall into the two-dimensional cell indexed by formula_76. For streaming data, when a new observation arrives, the appropriate formula_75 element is incremented. The Spearman&#x27;s rank
correlation can then be computed, based on the count matrix formula_74, using linear algebra operations (Algorithm 2). Note that for discrete random
variables, no discretization procedure is necessary. This method is applicable to stationary streaming data as well as large data sets. For non-stationary streaming data, where the Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient may change over time, the same procedure can be applied, but to a moving window of observations. When using a moving window, memory requirements grow linearly with chosen window size.

The second approach to approximating the Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient from streaming data involves the use of Hermite series based estimators. These estimators, based on Hermite polynomials,
allow sequential estimation of the probability density function and cumulative distribution function in univariate and bivariate cases. Bivariate Hermite series density
estimators and univariate Hermite series based cumulative distribution function estimators are plugged into a large sample version of the
Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient estimator, to give a sequential Spearman&#x27;s correlation estimator. This estimator is phrased in
terms of linear algebra operations for computational efficiency (equation (8) and algorithm 1 and 2). These algorithms are only applicable to continuous random variable data, but have
certain advantages over the count matrix approach in this setting. The first advantage is improved accuracy when applied to large numbers of observations. The second advantage is that the Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient can be
computed on non-stationary streams without relying on a moving window. Instead, the Hermite series based estimator uses an exponential weighting scheme to track time-varying Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation from streaming data,
which has constant memory requirements with respect to &quot;effective&quot; moving window size. A software implementation of these Hermite series based algorithms exists and is discussed in Software implementations.

==Software implementations==

* R&#x27;s statistics base-package implements the test codice_1 in its &quot;stats&quot; package (also codice_2 will work. The package spearmanCI computes confidence intervals. The package hermiter computes fast batch estimates of the Spearman correlation along with sequential estimates (i.e. estimates that are updated in an online/incremental manner as new observations are incorporated).
* Stata implementation: codice_3 calculates all pairwise correlation coefficients for all variables in &quot;varlist&quot;.
* MATLAB implementation: codice_4 where codice_5 is the Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient, codice_6 is the p-value, and codice_7 and codice_8 are vectors.
* Python has many different implementations of the spearman correlation statistic: it can be computed with the spearmanr function of the codice_9 module, as well as with the codice_10 method from the pandas library, and the codice_11 function from the statistical package pingouin.

<doc id="235626" wikidata="Q800922" url="?curid=235626" title="Highbury &amp; Islington station">
<text>Highbury &amp; Islington () is an interchange station in the London Borough of Islington, north London for London Underground, London Overground and National Rail services. The station is served by the Underground&#x27;s Victoria line, the Overground&#x27;s Mildmay and Windrush lines and Great Northern&#x27;s Northern City line.

On the Victoria line, the station is between and . On the Mildmay line, it is between and . The station is the terminus of the Windrush line, with Canonbury the preceding station. On the Northern City line, it is between and , down the line from .

It is one of the busiest stations in the UK. The station is situated in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==

The current station derives from two earlier stations. The first, which was on the same site, was a Victorian-gothic building, designed by Edwin Henry Horne, with a drive-in forecourt, opened on 26 September 1850 by the North London Railway (NLR) and called &#x27;Islington&#x27;. Following reconstruction, it was renamed &#x27;Highbury &amp; Islington&#x27; on 1 July 1872.

The second station, on the opposite side of Holloway Road, was opened on 28 June 1904 by the Great Northern &amp; City Railway (GN&amp;CR) on its underground line between and . Opened as &#x27;Highbury&#x27;, it was renamed to &#x27;Highbury &amp; Islington&#x27; on 20 July 1922. This line and stations were operated by the Metropolitan Railway and its successors from 1913 until 1975 when the line, by then called the Northern City line, was transferred to British Rail. The route is now operated by Great Northern.

The NLR station was damaged by a V-1 flying bomb on 27 June 1944; however, its main building remained in use until it was demolished in the 1960s during the building of the Victoria line. The original westbound platform buildings remain, as does a small part of the original entrance to the left of the present station entrance.

The present single-storey structure was built in the 1960s for the opening of the Victoria line on 1 September 1968 and is the entrance for all lines. When the escalators to the deep-level platforms were opened, the GN&amp;CR station building was closed. Its disused entrance remains and was refurbished externally in 2006 – it houses signalling equipment for the Victoria line.

The Victoria line was built to give as many interchanges as possible with Underground and British Rail lines, with, wherever possible, cross-platform connection between different lines heading in the same direction. To this end, at Highbury &amp; Islington the northbound Northern City line platform was reallocated to the southbound Victoria line to give a direct link between the two southbound platforms; a new northbound platform was constructed for each line; the northbound running NCL tunnel was diverted to its new platform; and the southbound Victoria line tunnel was joined to the old northbound NCL tunnel.

Between 14 May 1979 and 11 May 1985 the station was served by the Crosstown Linkline diesel multiple unit service between Camden Road and North Woolwich. 

The former train operating company Anglia Railways ran services known as London Crosslink from Norwich to Basingstoke via Stratford, which called at Highbury &amp; Islington. This service operated from 2000 until 2002.

To allow new four-car trains to run on the London Overground network, the North London line between and was closed between February and May 2010 while a new signalling system was installed and 30 platforms were extended. During this closure, the Highbury &amp; Islington station ticket hall was extended and step-free access installed on all of the London Overground platforms. The North London line reopened on 1 June 2010; however, the East London line platforms did not open until March 2011, whilst the Western Curve was reinstated, linking the station to Dalston Junction and the rest of the East London line.

==Platforms==
Highbury &amp; Islington has a total of eight platforms, divided between those that are on the surface and those that are deep level:
*Platform 1 – Windrush line (London Overground) services to 
*Platform 2 – Windrush line (London Overground) services to ( on Sundays)
*Platform 3 – Northbound Victoria line (London Underground)
*Platform 4 – Northbound Northern City line (Great Northern)
*Platform 5 – Southbound Victoria line (London Underground)
*Platform 6 – Southbound Northern City line (Great Northern)
*Platform 7 – Westbound Mildmay line (London Overground)
*Platform 8 – Eastbound Mildmay line (London Overground)

===Surface platforms===
Platforms for Mildmay line (formerly NLL) and Windrush line (formerly ELL) services are operated by London Overground. On 1 June 2010, following the temporary closure of the route from February 2010 to May 2010, NLL services were rerouted to the newly built platforms 7 and 8 for the AC lines, which replaced the old &quot;special use&quot; platform. Platforms 1 and 2, which previously served the NLL route on third rail lines, were closed from February 2010 for reconstruction and reopened in 2011 for the ELL services. The change of platforms allows ELL services to operate without having to cross over NLL tracks. An island platform provides platforms 2 and 7; platforms 1 and 8 are side platforms. When the ELL extension to Clapham Junction was first instituted in December 2012, trains ran through to Clapham Junction from this station throughout the week. Following a timetable change in December 2014, they only do so on Sundays, with the second destination served alongside Crystal Palace on weekdays &amp; Saturdays.

===Deep-level platforms===
Platforms 3 to 6 are deep-level platforms. Platforms 3 and 5 are used for services on the Victoria line; 4 and 6 are used for Northern City line services.

==Services==
===London Overground===

All times below are correct .

====Mildmay line====

<doc id="235631" wikidata="Q5372305" url="?curid=235631" title="Emily O'Reilly">
<text>Emily O&#x27;Reilly is an author and former journalist and broadcaster who became Ireland&#x27;s first female Ombudsman in 2003, succeeding Kevin Murphy. On 3 July 2013, she was voted European Ombudsman by the European Parliament. She was re-elected in 2014 and in 2019, in each case for a mandate of five more years. She was educated at University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, and Harvard University, where she was awarded a Nieman Fellowship in journalism.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Reilly is from Tullamore, County Offaly and her family moved to Dublin when she was 8 years old.

==Journalism==
She began her career as a journalist in the 1970s. She held senior positions with &quot;The Irish Press&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, as well as serving as a political columnist at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and as the Political Editor of &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot;. In 1991 she made an extended appearance on the British television discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside among others Patrick Cosgrave, J. P. Donleavy, David Norris and Francis Stuart.

In 1998, she became the editor of &quot;Magill&quot; magazine. She resigned in September 1999 when the magazine&#x27;s sister publication, &quot;In Dublin&quot;, was banned by the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board for advertising brothels and prostitution services. O&#x27;Reilly was also a broadcaster on RTÉ and Today FM.

O&#x27;Reilly is the author of three books: &quot;Candidate: The Truth Behind the Presidential Campaign&quot; (1991), about President of Ireland Mary Robinson; &quot;Masterminds of the Right&quot; (1992) about political Catholicism in Ireland; and a biography, &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; (1998).

In the course of her journalistic career, she won two awards: Journalist of the Year and Woman Journalist of the Year.

==Irish Ombudsman and Information Commissioner==
In April 2003, she was proposed as the Irish Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. On 1 June 2003, she received her warrant of appointment from the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, at Áras an Uachtaráin. She said of her job title, &quot;I will be an ombudswoman but will have no difficulty in being referred to as either&quot;.

In 2007, as Information Commissioner, she was appointed to the additional position of Commissioner for Environmental Information under the Access to Information on the Environment Regulations. She was appointed for a second term in 2009.

In December 2013, she resigned from these positions and was succeeded by Peter Tyndall.

===Transparency and accountability of Irish public bodies===
In a speech delivered in Dublin on 20 June 2006 to the Institute of Public Administration, O&#x27;Reilly criticised &quot;some service providers, both public and private&quot; for retreating from dealing personally with the public through the use of call centres and the Internet. She mentioned the Irish Revenue Commissioners in this context, pointing out that a significant proportion of the clients of these bodies &quot;do not have access to the web&quot; and therefore the level of personal contact is inadequate as a consequence. She also believed that public access to information under the Freedom of Information Act had been &quot;excessively curtailed&quot;, often in order to protect sectional interests, such as the performance of schools. She advised that the Act should be extended to include a number of public bodies previously exempted from the law, including the Garda Síochána, the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Asset Management Agency and that fees charged were a further inhibitor.

==European Ombudsman==
O&#x27;Reilly was appointed European Ombudsman by the European Parliament in 2013, and re-appointed in 2014 and 2019. Her current term expires in 2024. Next ombudsman is Teresa Anjinho.

<doc id="235633" wikidata="Q6790594" url="?curid=235633" title="Matthew Green (British politician)">
<text>Matthew Roger Green (born 12 April 1970) is a British politician. He was the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Ludlow from 2001 to 2005, and his party&#x27;s spokesman on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

==Parliamentary career==
He contested Wolverhampton South West in 1997 and was a councillor prior to his election to parliament.

Green was elected MP for Ludlow at the 2001 United Kingdom general election, with a majority of 1,630. He was the first Liberal to represent Ludlow since 1886. Green was appointed the party&#x27;s spokesman on youth affairs in November 2001, and was spokesman on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister between 2002 and 2003. He lost his seat to the Conservative, Philip Dunne, in the 2005 general election.

On 25 February 2006, he was selected as the Lib Dem candidate for Ludlow at the next general election but in May 2007 Green stood down as candidate owing to the rapid growth of his new business, Green Planning Solutions LLP. His brother Nathaniel Green was the Lib Dem candidate for Shrewsbury and Atcham at the 2019 general election.

==Later life==
His company, Green Planning Studio Ltd, act as agents for appellants in public appeals, some of which can be high profile. Matthew Green is often a professional planning witness in these cases. The appeals take place after applications for planning permission have been refused by Councils, or after an enforcement notice has been issued. Green Planning Studio’s clients include Councils; applicants for planning permission ranging from individual householders seeking extensions to larger scale housing developers; and third parties who usually are objecting to a proposed development. The company&#x27;s website claims: &quot;Particular skills and success for projects in the countryside, Green Belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the historic environment&quot;.  Some of Green Planning Studio’s clients are from the travelling community and their applications and subsequent appeals can attract significant press attention even for small scale developments. 

Green remained involved in politics after leaving Parliament, being mentioned by the &quot;Shropshire Star&quot; as a potential Liberal Democrat candidate in the 2021 North Shropshire by-election. In 2024, Green stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate in the new constituency of South Shropshire (this seat expands the borders of the old Ludlow constituency) and came second.
== Personal life ==
Green was born in Shropshire, living in Ratlinghope and Bishop&#x27;s Castle before moving to Much Wenlock by the time of his election. Prior to entering parliament he worked as a PR and media advisor.

<doc id="235634" wikidata="Q15221944" url="?curid=235634" title="Bombardier beetle">
<text>Bombardier beetles are ground beetles (Carabidae) in the tribes Brachinini, Paussini, Ozaenini, or Metriini—more than 500 species altogether—which are most notable for the defense mechanism that gives them their name: when disturbed, they eject a hot noxious chemical spray from the tip of the abdomen with a popping sound.

The spray is produced from a reaction between two hypergolic chemical compounds, hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide, which are stored in two reservoirs in the beetle&#x27;s abdomen. When the aqueous solution of hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide reaches the &quot;&quot; (Eisner&#x27;s word), catalysts facilitate the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation of the hydroquinone. Heat from the reaction brings the mixture to near the boiling point of water and produces gas that drives the ejection. The damage caused can be fatal to attacking insects. Some bombardier beetles can direct the spray in a wide range of directions.

The beetle&#x27;s unusual defense mechanism has been claimed by some creationists as something that could not have evolved, although this is refuted by evolutionary biologists.

==Habitat==

Bombardier beetles inhabit all the continents except Antarctica. They typically live in woodlands or grasslands in the temperate zones but can be found in other environments if there are moist places to lay their eggs.

==Behavior==
Most species of bombardier beetles are carnivorous, including the larva. The beetle typically hunts at night for other insects, but will often congregate with others of its species when not actively looking for food.

==Anatomy==
There are two large glands that open at the tip of the abdomen. Each gland is composed of a thick walled vestibule which contains a mixture of catalases and peroxidases produced by the secretory cells that line the vestibule. Both glands are also made up of a thin-walled and compressible reservoir which contains an aqueous solution of hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide.

==Mechanism of defense==

When the beetle feels threatened it opens a valve which allows the aqueous solution from the reservoir to reach the vestibule. The catalases lining the vestibule wall facilitate the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, as in the following theoretical reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt;H2O2(aq) -&gt; H2O(l) + 1/2O2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;

The peroxidase enzymes facilitate the oxidation of the hydroquinones into quinones (benzene-1,4-diol into 1,4-benzoquinone and analogously for methyl hydroquinone), as in the following theoretical reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt;C6H4(OH)2(aq) -&gt; C6H4O2(aq) + H2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;

The known net reaction, which further accounts for the theoretical reaction of the &lt;chem&gt;H2(g)&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;1/2O2(g)&lt;/chem&gt; products of the previous reactions, is:

:&lt;chem&gt;C6H4(OH)2(aq) + H2O2(aq) -&gt; C6H4O2(aq) + 2H2O(l)&lt;/chem&gt;

This reaction is very exothermic, and the released energy raises the temperature of the mixture to near 100 °C, vaporizing about a fifth of it. The resultant pressure buildup forces the entrance valves from the reactant storage chambers to close, thus protecting the beetle&#x27;s internal organs. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid is expelled violently through an outlet valve, with a loud popping sound. The beetles&#x27; glands store enough hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide to allow the beetle to release its chemical spray roughly 20 times. In some cases this is enough to kill a predator. The main component of the beetle spray is 1,4-benzoquinone, an irritant to the eyes and the respiratory system of vertebrates.

The flow of reactants into the reaction chamber and subsequent ejection occur in a series of about 70 pulses, at a rate of about 500 pulses per second. The whole sequence of events takes only a fraction of a second. These pulsations are caused by repeated microexplosions which are the results of the continuous pressure on the reservoir and the oscillatory opening and closing of the valve that controls access to the reaction chamber. This pulsed mechanism is beneficial for the beetles&#x27; survival because the system uses pressure instead of muscles to eject the spray at a constant velocity, saving the beetle energy. Also, the reintroduction of new reactants into the vestibule where enzymes are stored, reduces the temperature of the chamber, thereby protecting the peroxidases and catalases from thermal denaturation.

Typically the beetle turns its body so as to direct the jet towards whatever triggered the response. The gland openings of some African bombardier beetles can swivel through 270° and thrust between the insect&#x27;s legs, discharging the fluid in a wide range of directions with considerable accuracy.

==Evolution of the defense mechanism==
The unique combination of features of the bombardier beetle&#x27;s defense mechanism—strongly exothermic reactions, boiling-hot fluids, and explosive release—has been claimed by creationists to be an example of something that could not have evolved.

Biologists such as the taxonomist Mark Isaak note however that step-by-step evolution of the mechanism could readily have occurred. The full evolutionary history of the beetle&#x27;s unique defense mechanism is unknown, but biologists have shown that the system could have evolved from defenses found in other beetles in incremental steps by natural selection. Specifically, quinone chemicals are a precursor to sclerotin, a brownish substance produced by beetles and other insects to harden their exoskeleton. Some beetles additionally store excess foul-smelling quinones, including hydroquinone, in small sacs below their skin as a natural deterrent against predators—all carabid beetles have this sort of arrangement. Some beetles additionally mix hydrogen peroxide, a common by-product of the metabolism of cells, with the hydroquinone; some of the catalases that exist in most cells make the process more efficient. The chemical reaction produces heat and pressure, and some beetles exploit the latter to push out the chemicals onto the skin; this is the case in the beetle &quot;Metrius contractus&quot;, which produces a foamy discharge when attacked. In the bombardier beetle, the muscles that prevent leakage from the reservoir additionally developed a valve permitting more controlled discharge of the poison and an elongated abdomen to permit better control over the direction of discharge.

<doc id="235641" wikidata="Q266146" url="?curid=235641" title="Chris Bryant">
<text>Sir Christopher John Bryant (born 11 January 1962) is a British politician and former Anglican priest who has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Rhondda and Ogmore, and previously Rhondda, since 2001. A member of the Labour Party, he has been the Minister of State for Data Protection and Telecoms and Minister of State for Creative Industries, Arts and Tourism since 2024.

Born in Cardiff, Bryant was privately educated at Cheltenham College before studying English at Mansfield College, Oxford. After graduating with a further degree in theology, he worked as a Church of England priest, as well as having roles at the BBC and Common Purpose. He was elected for Rhondda at the 2001 general election.

He previously served in government as Deputy Leader of the House of Commons from 2008 to 2009 and Under-Secretary of State for Europe and Asia from 2009 to 2010. Bryant served in the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Culture Secretary in 2015 and Shadow Leader of the House of Commons from 2015 to 2016, before resigning in protest at Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership.

==Early life and career==
Chris Bryant was born on 11 January 1962 in Cardiff, to a Scottish mother and a Welsh father. Bryant grew up in Cardiff (where his father worked for five years), Spain for five years in the 1960s (leading to him speaking fluent Spanish), and Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He was educated at Cheltenham College, an independent school for boys, and at Mansfield College, Oxford, where he read English.

Although initially a member of the Conservative Party, and an elected office-holder in the Oxford University Conservative Association, he joined the Labour Party in 1986 after leaving Oxford.

After completing his first degree, Bryant began his training to be a priest in the Church of England at Ripon College Cuddesdon in Oxfordshire. There, he obtained a further degree in theology.

He was ordained deacon in 1986 and priest in 1987. He served as a curate at the Church of All Saints, High Wycombe from 1986 to 1989 and then as a Youth Chaplain in Peterborough, as well as travelling in Latin America.
In 1991, Bryant left the ordained ministry, after deciding that being gay and being a priest were incompatible. Statements made by Richard Harries, the then-Bishop of Oxford, also influenced his decision.

==Early political career==
After leaving the priesthood in 1991, Bryant made a career move and began work as the election agent to the Holborn and St Pancras Constituency Labour Party, where he helped Frank Dobson hold his seat in the 1992 general election. From 1993, he was Local Government Officer for the Labour Party; he lived in Hackney and was elected to Hackney Borough Council in 1993, representing Leabridge ward and serving until 1998. He became Chairman of the Christian Socialist Movement. From 1994 to 1996, he was London manager of the charity Common Purpose.

In 1996, Bryant became a full-time author, writing biographies of Stafford Cripps and Glenda Jackson.

From 1998 until his election to Parliament in 2001, Bryant was the Head of European Affairs for the BBC.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1997 general election, Bryant was the Labour candidate for Wycombe, winning 35.4% of the vote and coming second behind the incumbent Conservative MP Ray Whitney.

Bryant&#x27;s selection for the very safe Labour seat of Rhondda in South Wales in 2000 surprised many people given his background – gay, a former Anglican cleric, and someone who had been a Conservative as a student. He says of his surprise selection, &quot;I fell off the chair, and my opponents certainly did&quot;. Fifty-two people applied for the candidature and a local councillor was the favourite to win. Bryant was elected as MP for Rhondda at the 2001 general election with a majority of 16,047 and 68.3% of the vote.

In 2003, Bryant voted for participation in the Iraq war. He is a member of the Labour Friends of Israel and Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East group.

From 2004 until 2007, Bryant was chairman of the Labour Movement for Europe. Bryant is a signatory of the Henry Jackson Society principles.

At the 2005 general election, Bryant was re-elected with a decreased vote share of 68.1% but an increased majority of 16,242.

On 5 September 2006, with Siôn Simon, he coordinated a prominent letter which was signed by 15 Labour backbenchers calling for Tony Blair&#x27;s immediate resignation.

Bryant was the Parliamentary private secretary to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs Charlie Falconer. In Gordon Brown&#x27;s autumn 2008 reshuffle, Bryant was promoted from his role as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Harriet Harman to the ministerial position of Deputy Leader of the House of Commons otherwise known as Parliamentary Secretary to the House of Commons. This was followed by another move in the June 2009 reshuffle, when he moved to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. On 13 October 2009, he was also appointed Minister for Europe.

===Phone hacking scandal===

On 11 March 2003, as part of an inquiry into Privacy and Press Intrusion by the Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, he asked Rebekah Wade (now Brooks) whether she had ever paid police officers for information. Seated beside Andy Coulson, the editor of the &quot;News of the World&quot;, she said &#x27;yes&#x27;. Bryant had his phone hacked later that year by the &quot;News of the World&quot;, a fact which became known to the Metropolitan Police when they seized material from the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. Bryant, along with John Prescott and Brian Paddick, sought judicial review of the Metropolitan Police in an attempt to force them to contact all the victims of phone hacking by the &quot;News of the World&quot;. The Metropolitan Police accepted their liability and he won damages of £30,000 from News International in 2012.

Bryant called for and led the parliamentary debates on referring the phone hacking scandal to the Standards and Privileges Committee on 9 September 2010, and the Emergency Debate on whether there should be a judge led enquiry on 6 July 2011 which led to the setting up of the Leveson Inquiry.

=== Expenses scandal ===
Bryant claimed over £92,000 in expenses over the five years leading up to the 2009 scandal over MPs&#x27; expenses. During that time he flipped his second home twice. He claimed mortgage interest expenses that started at £7,800 per year before rising (after flipping) to £12,000 per year. He also claimed £6,400 in stamp duty and other fees on his most recent purchase, and £6,000 per year in service charges.

===In opposition===
At the 2010 general election, Bryant was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 55.3% and a decreased majority of 11,553.

In October 2010, Bryant stood as one of 49 candidates for election to the 19 places in the Shadow Cabinet in the internal Labour Party poll, receiving 77 votes, 29th position on the list.

In October 2010, Bryant described the coalition government&#x27;s housing benefit reforms as poorer people &quot;being socially engineered and sociologically cleansed out of London&quot;. The use of the term &quot;cleansing&quot; was criticised by members of the coalition, including deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who called Bryant&#x27;s comment &quot;offensive to people who had witnessed ethnic cleansing in other parts of the world&quot;.

In 2011, in the House of Commons, he criticised Prince Andrew, Duke of York for a number of alleged indiscretions.

Bryant won the Stonewall Politician of the Year Award in 2011 for his work to support equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people. He was given a score of 100% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall. On 5 February 2013, he voted in favour in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on same-sex marriage in Britain.

Following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Bryant told the Commons &#x27;I am afraid that the international response... has thus far been pitiful and spineless. People have even trotted out in this Chamber the argument that most of the people in Crimea are Russian speaking and wanted to join Russia in the first place. Can Members not hear history running through the decades?... There has been little honour in the way that Britain, France and the United States, having signed up to the Budapest memorandum, which guaranteed the territorial integrity of Ukraine, now make lots of great speeches but introduce the measliest level of sanctions and targeted interventions against Russian individuals... A Russian friend of mine says that Putin is not yet mad. That may be true, but what will our surrendering and our appeasement do for his sanity?&#x27;

In December 2014, Bryant was moved from Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform to Shadow Minister for the Arts. In this position, he suggested in January 2015 that too many successful artists such as &quot;James Blunt and their ilk&quot; had been educated at private schools, and that he wanted to see more encouragement for the arts for people from a variety of backgrounds, even though Bryant himself attended a private school. Blunt said that Bryant was a &quot;narrow-minded &#x27;classist gimp&#x27; who was motivated by the &#x27;politics of jealousy&#x27;&quot;; Bryant responded by claiming that Blunt should not be &quot;so blooming precious&quot; and that he was not &quot;knocking [his] success&quot; but attempting to draw attention to the lack of diversity in the arts.

At the 2015 general election, Bryant was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 50.7% and a decreased majority of 7,455.

In September 2015, following Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s election as Labour Party leader, Bryant was appointed Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. He resigned from this position on 26 June 2016, along with other shadow ministers after the Brexit vote. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.

He supported Remain in the EU referendum in June 2016 and voted against the triggering of Article 50 in February 2017.

In January 2017, as ex-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for Russia, Bryant claimed that the Russian government orchestrated a homophobic campaign to remove him from this position, saying that the Russian government has acquired &quot;kompromat&quot; on high-profile Conservative Party MPs including Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, Alan Duncan and David Davis.

On 12 January 2017, Bryant bemused his fellow MPs and Speaker of the House John Bercow, when he wished Bercow happy &quot;kiss a ginger day&quot;, during business questions.

At the snap 2017 general election, Bryant was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 64.1% and an increased majority of 13,746.

Following the general election in 2017, Bryant came first in the ballot for Private Members Bills, and after consulting his constituents introduced the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Bill, which introduced a new offence of assaulting an emergency worker. It received royal assent on 13 November 2018 as the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018.

In November 2017, Bryant called for the arrest of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, if he travels to the United Kingdom, after the President shared a comment on the social media website Twitter from a member of the far-right group Britain First that related to radical Islamic events. Bryant stated: &quot;The Prime Minister should make it absolutely clear that if Donald Trump comes to this country he&#x27;ll be arrested for inciting religious hatred and therefore he&#x27;d be better off not coming at all.&quot;

Following John Bercow&#x27;s resignation as Speaker of the House of Commons on 31 October 2019, Bryant stood in the election for a new speaker on 4 November 2019, losing to Lindsay Hoyle by 213 to 325.

At the 2019 general election, Bryant was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 54.4% and a decreased majority of 11,440.

In May 2020, Bryant was elected as the Chair of the Commons Select Committee on Standards and Commons Select Committee of Privileges, . In October 2021, he chaired the Standards Committee&#x27;s decision on the sanction to be applied to Owen Paterson for breaching lobbying rules relating to paid advocacy which triggered the parliamentary second jobs controversy. In April 2022, due to having already expressed views about the Partygate scandal, Bryant recused himself from the subsequent investigation by the Privileges Committee into whether Boris Johnson had committed contempt of parliament over statements to the House of Commons concerning alleged parties.

Bryant came tenth in the Private Members Bill ballot in the 2021–2022 Session of Parliament and introduced the Acquired Brain Injury Bill on 10 November 2021, which would require the Government to produce, implement and review a national strategy for acquired brain injury. He withdrew the Bill when the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Sajid Javid, announced that Bryant and Gillian Keegan, the minister for Care and Mental Health, would co-chair a cross-government programme board to draw up a national strategy in December 2021. Keegan said: “All Government departments are invited to join the board. The strategy will be kept under review and revised periodically, to ensure it continues to reflect the priority areas and actions needed to support those living with ABI, and their families.” 

In December 2021, Bryant told the BBC in an interview that he felt &quot;less physically safe as a gay man than he did 30 years ago.&quot; While denying that Boris Johnson himself was homophobic, he accused those around him of being happy to &quot;stir the pot.&quot; As evidence, he cited the government&#x27;s stance on transgender people and their attitude towards conversion therapy.

Bryant campaigned for the UK Government to introduce Magnitsky Sanctions on those who abuse human rights around the world and co-chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Magnitsky Sanctions with Sir Iain Duncan Smith MP and is a Member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

In the 2023 British shadow cabinet reshuffle, he was appointed Shadow Minister for the Creative Industries and Digital.

Bryant was elected MP for the Rhondda and Ogmore constituency which replaced the former Rhondda seat at the 2024 general election.

=== Unparliamentary language ===
In December 2020, Bryant became engaged in a row with the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. The disturbance started with Bryant heckling the Prime Minister while standing near to a door. The Speaker informed Bryant that social distancing rules meant he needed to move and he then instructed Bryant to sit in one of the seats intended for use by MPs. Some of those present thought that Bryant then uttered an offensive expletive back to the Speaker although Bryant denied this. Bryant then exited the chamber of the Commons while the Speaker called for him. Some moments after the Speaker had denounced Bryant&#x27;s &quot;disgraceful behaviour&quot;, Bryant returned to the chamber to engage in what appeared to be a heated discussion with the speaker. Hoyle said: &quot;Mr Bryant, I think we need to have this conversation later&quot; and Bryant left the chamber.

=== Misleading Parliament ===
In March 2022 Bryant misled Parliament when he claimed that Nigel Farage had been paid over £500,000 by the Russian state. In July 2023 he admitted that he had not told the truth.

=== Filibuster on Gaza ceasefire vote ===
During a Channel 4 News interview, Bryant admitted he was ordered to filibuster the progress on the SNP&#x27;s motion for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza – and accepted &#x27;we brought ourselves terribly into disrepute.&quot; This filibuster is believed to have bought time for the Labour leader to have an unscheduled meeting with Speaker Lindsay Hoyle. Hoyle would then break parliamentary convention, going against the advice of his Clerks, to benefit the Labour Party leader by allowing the party&#x27;s amendment to be heard, meaning that MPs would not get the chance to formally vote on the SNP&#x27;s motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

Following Bryant&#x27;s confession, the SNP called for a &quot;full independent investigation&quot; into his comments which they said proved Labour deilberately sought to derail their motion. MP Kirsty Blackman criticised Bryant&#x27;s comments claiming: &quot;These damning revelations show Sir Keir Starmer pulled every dirty trick in the Westminster book to wreck the SNP&#x27;s vote on an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bryant entered into a civil partnership with Jared Cranney on 27 March 2010. The ceremony was the first civil partnership ever held in the Houses of Parliament. They are now married. Bryant lives in Porth in the Rhondda.

He was ridiculed by the press in 2003 when he posted a picture of himself wearing only underpants on a gay dating site, Gaydar. Bryant later reflected upon the affair, saying, &quot;It was a wound but it&#x27;s a rather charming scar now. I had a period when I barely slept and it was horrible, but I&#x27;m very lucky in having a supportive set of friends – MP friends and others – and they looked after me.&quot; At the time, the media predicted that he would not survive politically, and there was much talk of his possible deselection. In 2013, he reflected on the incident, saying that the whole affair actually boosted his majority as an MP.

On 25 September 2006, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ran four spoof diary articles called &quot;Chris Bryant&#x27;s Manchester Diary&quot;. The newspaper later printed a clarification to confirm that these were parodies, and were not written by Bryant.

In March 2019, Bryant said that he had undergone surgery for skin cancer.

On 1 May 2022, Bryant stated that he had been groped and &quot;touched up&quot; by older male MPs early in his career in the House of Commons.

In May 2024, Bryant announced that his skin cancer had spread to his lung, and was undergoing immunotherapy for it; he urged people to &quot;please take skin cancer seriously&quot;.

==Honours==
Bryant was knighted in the 2023 New Year Honours for political and public service.

<doc id="235642" wikidata="Q464543" url="?curid=235642" title="Portal vein">
<text>The portal vein or hepatic portal vein (HPV) is a blood vessel that carries blood from the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas and spleen to the liver. This blood contains nutrients and toxins extracted from digested contents. Approximately 75% of total liver blood flow is through the portal vein, with the remainder coming from the hepatic artery proper. The blood leaves the liver to the heart in the hepatic veins.

The portal vein is not a true vein, because it conducts blood to capillary beds in the liver and not directly to the heart. It is a major component of the hepatic portal system, one of three portal venous systems in the human body; the others being the hypophyseal and renal portal systems.

The portal vein is usually formed by the confluence of the superior mesenteric, splenic veins, inferior mesenteric, left, right gastric veins and the pancreatic vein.

Conditions involving the portal vein cause considerable illness and death. An important example of such a condition is elevated blood pressure in the portal vein. This condition, called portal hypertension, is a major complication of cirrhosis. In abdominal obesity fats, inflammatory cytokines and other toxic substances are transported by the portal vein from visceral fat into the liver, leading to hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.

==Structure==
Measuring approximately 8 cm (3 inches) long in adults, the portal vein is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, originating behind the neck of the pancreas.

In most individuals, the portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein. For this reason, the portal vein is occasionally called the splenic-mesenteric confluence. Occasionally, the portal vein also directly communicates with the inferior mesenteric vein, although this is highly variable. Other tributaries of the portal vein include the cystic and the left and right gastric veins. and also pararumbilical vein and prepyloric vein.

Immediately before reaching the liver, the portal vein divides into right and left. It ramifies further, forming smaller venous branches and ultimately portal venules. Each portal venule courses alongside a hepatic arteriole and the two vessels form the vascular components of the portal triad. These vessels ultimately empty into the hepatic sinusoids to supply blood to the liver.

===Portacaval anastomoses===
The portal venous system has several anastomoses with the systemic venous system. In cases of portal hypertension these anastomoses may become engorged, dilated, or varicosed and subsequently rupture.

===Accessory hepatic portal veins===
Accessory hepatic portal veins are those veins that drain directly into the liver without joining the hepatic portal vein. These include the paraumbilical veins as well as veins of the lesser omentum, falciform ligament, and those draining the gallbladder wall.

==Function==
The portal vein and hepatic arteries form the liver&#x27;s dual blood supply. Approximately 75% of hepatic blood flow is derived from the portal vein, while the remainder is from the hepatic arteries.

Unlike most veins, the portal vein does not drain into the heart. Rather, it is part of a portal venous system that delivers venous blood into another capillary system, the hepatic sinusoids of the liver. In carrying venous blood from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver, the portal vein accomplishes two tasks: it supplies the liver with metabolic substrates and it ensures that substances ingested are first processed by the liver before reaching the systemic circulation. This accomplishes two things. First, possible toxins that may be ingested can be detoxified by the hepatocytes before they are released into the systemic circulation. Second, the liver is the first organ to absorb nutrients just taken in by the intestines. After draining into the liver sinusoids, blood from the liver is drained by the hepatic vein.

==Clinical significance==

===Portal hypertension===
Increased blood pressure in the portal vein, called portal hypertension, is a major complication of liver disease, most commonly cirrhosis. A dilated portal vein (diameter of greater than 13 or 15 mm) is a sign of portal hypertension, with a sensitivity estimated at 12.5% or 40%. On Doppler ultrasonography, the main portal vein (MPV) peak systolic velocity normally ranges between 20 cm/s and 40 cm/s. A slow velocity of &lt;16 cm/s in addition to dilatation in the MPV are diagnostic of portal hypertension.

Clinical signs of portal hypertension include those of chronic liver disease: ascites, esophageal varices, spider nevi, caput medusae, and palmar erythema.

===Pulsatility===
Portal vein pulsatility can be measured by Doppler ultrasonography. An increased pulsatility may be caused by cirrhosis, as well as increased right atrial pressure (which in turn may be caused by right heart failure or tricuspid regurgitation). Portal vein pulsatility can be quantified by pulsatility indices (PI), where an index above a certain cutoff indicates pathology:

===Infection===
Pylephlebitis is infection of the portal vein, usually arising from an infectious intra-abdominal process such as diverticulitis.

===Portal venous gas===
Hepatic portal venous gas is a rare finding on radiological exams. Gas is shown to enter the portal venous system. It is most commonly caused by intestinal ischemia but has also been associated with colon cancer.

<text>The Public Schools Act 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 118) was enacted by the British Parliament to reform and regulate seven leading English boys&#x27; boarding schools, most of which had grown out of ancient charity schools for the education of a certain number of poor scholars, but were by then, as they are today, also educating many sons of the English upper and upper-middle classes on a fee-paying basis. The preamble describes &quot;An Act to make further Provision for the good Government and Extension of certain Public Schools in England.&quot;
The concept of a public school therefore predates this Act.

The Act followed the report of the Clarendon Commission, a Royal Commission set up to inquire into nine leading schools, which sat from 1861 to 1864 and investigated conditions and abuses which had grown up over the centuries at these originally charity schools.

The bill was presented for its first reading in the Lords by Lord Clarendon on 13 March 1865 and for its second reading on 3 April 1865. The bill was in two parts, the first containing the general provisions of the bill and the second containing specific proposals for each school.

St Paul&#x27;s School and Merchant Taylors&#x27; School were omitted, as they argued successfully that their constitutions made them legally &quot;private&quot; schools and that their constitutions could not be altered by public legislation; thus the act concerned itself with the other seven schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission:

* Charterhouse School
* Eton College
* Harrow School
* Rugby School
* Shrewsbury School
* Westminster School
* Winchester College

The act regulated these seven schools in a number of ways, as recommended by the Clarendon Commission, with the aim of creating better conditions in them and preventing abuses, and authorized the establishment of a board of governors for each school, to supervise their administration. It also freed them of their obligations under their founding charters to educate &quot;Foundation Scholars&quot;, i.e. scholarship boys paying nominal or no fees. The Act made it clear that Parliament had authority to legislate for the schools. The act led to development of the schools away from the traditional exclusively classics-based curriculum taught by clergymen, to a somewhat broader scope of studies.

In 1887 the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal determined that the City of London School was a public school.

<text>Keelhauling (Dutch &quot;kielhalen&quot;; &quot;to drag along the keel&quot;) is a form of punishment and potential execution once meted out to sailors at sea. The sailor was tied to a line looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship&#x27;s keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern).

== History ==

There is limited evidence that keelhauling in this form was used by pirate ships, especially in the ancient world. The earliest known mention of keelhauling is from the Greeks in the Rhodian Maritime Code (&quot;Lex Rhodia&quot;), of c. 700 BC, which outlines punishment for piracy. There is an image on a Greek vase, for example, from the same era that is either a representation of strappado — that is, hanging the victim over the water - or of a keelhauling proper. 

Several 17th-century English writers such as William Monson and Nathaniel Boteler recorded the use of keel-hauling on English naval ships. However, their references are vague and provide no date. There seems to be no record of it in English ships&#x27; logs of the era, and naval historian Nicholas Rodger has stated he knows of no firm evidence that it ever happened. In 1880, George Shaw Lefevre was confronted in Parliament with a recent report from Italy of a keelhauling on HMS &quot;Alexandra&quot;, and denied that such an incident had taken place.

Some historians believe keelhauling may have been introduced to the Dutch Navy by William of Orange. On 11 October 1652, under Jan Van Riebeeck&#x27;s command, Jan Blank, a sailor, was keelhauled, whipped a total of 150 lashes, and then enslaved for 2 years as punishment for deserting the VOC - he had deserted for just 9 days. Perhaps the most graphic incident of it occurred in 1673 when Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest punished sailors who committed murder. It was an official, though rare, punishment in the Dutch navy, as shown in the painting &quot;The keelhauling of the ship&#x27;s surgeon of Admiral Jan van Nes&quot;. This shows a large crowd gathered to watch the event, as though it was a &quot;show&quot; punishment intended to frighten other potential offenders, as was flogging round the fleet. 

A footnote in one source suggests that it may have evolved from the medieval punishment of ducking.

The term still survives today, although usually in the sense of being severely rebuked.

<doc id="235648" wikidata="Q5162729" url="?curid=235648" title="Conscience vote">
<text>A conscience vote or free vote is a type of vote in a legislative body where legislators are allowed to vote according to their own personal conscience rather than according to an official line set down by their political party. In a parliamentary system, especially within the Westminster system, it can also be used to indicate crossbench members of a hung parliament, where confidence and supply is provided to allow formation of a minority government but the right to vote on conscience is retained. &quot;Free votes&quot; are found in Canadian and some British legislative bodies; &quot;conscience votes&quot; are used in Australian legislative bodies; &quot;personal votes&quot; can be held in the New Zealand Parliament.

Under the Westminster system, MPs who belong to a political party are usually required by that party to vote in accordance with the party line on significant legislation, on pain of censure or expulsion from the party. Sometimes a particular party member known as the party whip is responsible for maintaining this party discipline. However, in the case of a conscience vote, a party does not dictate an official party line to follow and members may vote as they please. Sometimes a vote may be free for some parties but not for others. In countries where party discipline is less important and voting against one&#x27;s party is more common, conscience votes are generally less important.

In most countries, conscience votes are quite rare and are often about issues that are very contentious, or a matter on which the members of any single party differ in their opinions, thus making it difficult for parties to formulate official policies. Usually, a conscience vote will be about religious, moral or ethical issues rather than about administrative or financial ones. Matters such as the prohibition of alcohol, abortion, homosexuality law reform and the legality of prostitution are often subject to conscience votes. 

==Practice in various countries==

===Australia===
Conscience votes have been held in the Australian Parliament and in State Parliaments on issues of becoming a republic, abortion, euthanasia, homosexuality, sex discrimination, prostitution, and bioethical issues like assisted reproduction and stem cell research, besides other issues.

===Canada===
The decision to grant a free vote lies with party leaders in Canada. Sometimes a vote may be free for some parties but not for others. For instance, when the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper proposed a motion to re-open the debate on Canada&#x27;s same-sex marriage laws, his Conservatives and the opposition Liberals declared it a free vote for their members, while the Bloc Québécois and the New Democrats both maintained party discipline to defeat the measure.

===New Zealand===
In the New Zealand Parliament, the Speaker decides if a vote will be a personal vote. They may do so after any MP requests it following a contested voice vote. The Speaker usually agrees to such a request, but not always. A personal vote differs from a party vote in that MPs must physically enter a lobby to vote on a motion, rather than a party&#x27;s whip calling out the votes on behalf of its MPs. Legislation that was treated as a conscience issue includes the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986, Prostitution Reform Act 2003, Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013, End of Life Choice Act 2019 and Abortion Legislation Act 2020. The most common topic for conscience votes in New Zealand has been alcohol; a conscience vote relating to alcohol has happened every decade since the 1890s.

In the case of a party vote, a party can decide to allow its members to vote differently from one another, in a split party vote. Thus individual parties can allow their members a conscience vote even when the Speaker has not declared a personal vote.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the British House of Commons there used to be a conscience vote every few years on the restoration of the death penalty, which had been abolished in 1964 (except for treason, for which it was abolished in 1998 in the Human Rights Act). It had always been rejected and this practice has now been abandoned. In Britain, laws concerning abortion have always been subject to a free vote.

The proposed bans on hunting with dogs proposed by Tony Blair&#x27;s government were the subject of several free votes in Parliament from 2001. On each occasion the Commons voted for a ban and the House of Lords rejected it. In 2004 the Government, trying to placate the Lords and other opponents of a ban, proposed only restriction and licensing of hunting, but anti-hunting MPs (mostly Labour backbenchers) forced through an amendment that would effect a total ban. Seconds after the vote on the amendment, the Government bowed to pressure and agreed to force the ban through the Lords under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. It passed in November 2004.

Other decisions that were taken by a free vote include abandoning the experiment with permanent summer time and bringing television cameras into Parliament.

=== United States===
In the United States, parties exercise comparatively little control over the votes of individual legislators. However, the parties&#x27; whips offer varying amounts of incentives or disincentives to unite the party on major votes. As an extreme case, Democrat James Traficant was stripped of his seniority and committee assignments in 2001 when he voted for a Republican, Dennis Hastert, to be Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. 

When a party&#x27;s leadership declines to whip votes in a situation where they normally would, this is sometimes called a &quot;conscience vote,&quot; &quot;vote of conscience,&quot; or members &quot;voting their consciences.&quot; For instance, an aide to Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said that &quot;Decisions about war and peace are conscience votes and they aren’t whipped traditionally,&quot; regarding the potential disapproval of the Iran nuclear agreement. Similarly, when House Republican leadership decided not to whip votes against the second impeachment of Donald Trump, Liz Cheney—the third-highest-ranking Republican—referred to the matter as a &quot;vote of conscience&quot;. At other times the terms are used to describe a vote based on personal morals rather than political considerations.

<text>Eels are any of several long, thin, bony fishes of the order Anguilliformes. They have a catadromous life cycle, that is: at different stages of development migrating between inland waterways and the deep ocean. Because fishermen never caught anything they recognized as young eels, the life cycle of the eel was long a mystery. Of particular interest has been the search for the spawning grounds for the various species of eels, and identifying the population impacts of different stages of the life cycle.

==Past studies of eels==
The European eel (&quot;Anguilla anguilla&quot;) is the one most familiar to Western scientists, beginning with Aristotle, who wrote the earliest known inquiry into the natural history of eels. He speculated that they were born of &quot;earth worms&quot;, which he believed were formed of mud, growing from the &quot;guts of wet soil&quot; rather than through sexual reproduction. Many centuries passed before scientists were able to demonstrate that such spontaneous generation does not occur.

In 1777, the Italian Carlo Mondini located an eel&#x27;s ovaries and demonstrated that eels are a kind of fish. In 1876, as a young student in Austria, Sigmund Freud dissected hundreds of eels in search of the male sex organs. He had to concede failure in his first major published research paper, and turned to other issues in frustration.

Larval eels — transparent, leaflike two-inch (five-cm) creatures of the open ocean — were not generally recognized as eels until 1893; instead, they were thought to be a separate species, &quot;Leptocephalus brevirostris&quot; (from the Greek &quot;leptocephalus&quot; meaning &quot;thin- or flat-head&quot;). In 1886, however, the French zoologist Yves Delage discovered the truth when he kept leptocephali alive in a laboratory tank in Roscoff until they matured into eels, and in 1896 Italian zoologist Giovanni Battista Grassi confirmed the finding when he observed the transformation of a &quot;Leptocephalus&quot; into a round glass eel in the Mediterranean Sea. (He also observed that salt water was necessary to support the maturation process.) Although the connection between larval eels and adult eels is now well understood, the name leptocephalus is still used for larval eel.

==Search for the spawning grounds==


===European eel===
The Danish professor Johannes Schmidt, beginning in 1904, led a series of expeditions into the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic (the Dana expeditions) to investigate eels. The expeditions were largely financed by the Carlsberg Foundation. He noted that all the leptocephali he found were very similar, and hypothesized that they all must have descended from a common ancestor. He also observed that the farther out to sea in the Atlantic Ocean he went, the smaller the leptocephali were. In a 1922 expedition, he sailed as far as the Sargasso Sea, south of Bermuda, where he caught the smallest eel-larvae that had ever been seen. Although Schmidt did not directly observe eel spawning, or even find ready-to-spawn adult eels, he deduced the following about the life history of the eel, based on the size distribution of the leptocephali he collected: The larvae of European eels travel with the Gulf Stream across the Atlantic Ocean from the Sargasso Sea, and grow to 75–90 mm within one to three years, before they reach the coasts of Europe. Marine eels of the order Anguilliformes also have a leptocephalus stage, and likely pass through a stage similar to the anguillid glass eels, but they are rarely seen in the ocean. 

Eels in this so-called &quot;recruitment&quot; developmental stage are known as glass eels because of the transparency of their bodies. The term typically refers to a transparent eel of the family Anguillidae. It is applied to an intermediary stage in the eel&#x27;s complex life history between the leptocephalus stage and the juvenile (elver) stage. Glass eels are defined as &quot;all developmental stages from completion of leptocephalus metamorphosis until full pigmentation&quot;. Once the glass eels arrive at coastal areas, they migrate up rivers and streams, overcoming various natural and man-made challenges — sometimes by piling up their bodies by the tens of thousands to climb over obstacles — and they reach even the smallest of creeks. At this stage in their growth they are small enough to benefit from surface tension in order to climb vertical walls.

In fresh water they develop pigmentation, turn into elvers (young eels), and feed on creatures such as small crustaceans, worms, and insects. For 10 to 14 years they mature, growing to a length of 60 to 80 cm. The eels can propel themselves over wet grass and dig through wet sand to reach upstream headwaters and ponds, thus colonizing the continent. During this stage they are called yellow eels because of their golden pigmentation. 

In July, some mature individuals migrate back towards the sea, sometimes crossing wet grasslands at night to reach rivers that lead to the sea. Eel migrations out of their freshwater growth habitats from various parts of Europe, or through the Baltic Sea in the Danish straits, have been the basis of traditional fisheries with characteristic trapnets. 

Details of the adults&#x27; migration across open ocean journey back to their spawning grounds north of the Antilles, Haiti, and Puerto Rico remain poorly understood. By the time they leave Europe, their gut dissolves, making feeding impossible, so they have to rely on stored energy alone. The external features undergo other dramatic changes, as well: the eyes start to enlarge, the eye pigments change for optimal vision in dim blue clear ocean light, and the sides of their bodies turn silvery, to create a countershading pattern which makes them difficult to see by predators during their long open-ocean migration. These migrating eels are typically called &quot;silver eels&quot; or &quot;big eyes&quot;.

German fisheries biologist Friedrich Wilhelm Tesch conducted many expeditions with high-tech instrumentation to follow eel migration, first down the Baltic, then along the coasts of Norway and England, but finally the transmitter signals were lost at the continental shelf when the batteries ran out According to Schmidt, a travel speed in the ocean of 15 km per day can be assumed, so a silver eel would need around 140 to 150 days to reach the Sargasso Sea from Scotland and about 165 to 175 days when leaving from the English Channel.

Tesch — like Schmidt — kept trying to persuade sponsors to provide more funding for expeditions. His proposal was to release 50 silver eels from Danish waters, with transmitters that would detach from the eels each second day, float up toward the surface, and broadcast their position, depth, and temperature to satellite receivers. He also suggested that countries on the western side of the Atlantic could perform a similar release experiment at the same time. In December 2018 researchers in the Azores, (about 1,400 km (870 mi) west of the Iberian coast—the furthest point on the migration route identified in previous experiments) fitted 26 large female European eels with satellite tags and released them into the Atlantic Ocean. Tracking demonstrated that the fishes&#x27; journey to the Sargasso took a further year, or more.

===American eel===
Another Atlantic eel species is known: the American eel, &quot;Anguilla rostrata&quot;. First it was believed European and American eels were the same species due to their similar appearance and behavior, but they differ in chromosome count and various molecular genetic markers, and in the number of vertebrae, &quot;A. anguilla&quot; counting 110 to 119 and &quot;A. rostrata&quot; 103 to 110.

The spawning grounds for the two species are in an overlapping area of the southern Sargasso Sea, with &quot;A. rostrata&quot; apparently being more westward than &quot;A. anguilla&quot;. This was confirmed in 2023. After spawning in the Sargasso Sea and moving to the west, the leptocephali of the American eel exit the Gulf Stream earlier than the European eel and begin migrating into the estuaries along the east coast of North America between February and late April at an age around one year and a length around 60 mm.

===Japanese eel===
The spawning area of the Japanese eel, &quot;Anguilla japonica&quot;, has also been found. Their breeding site is to the west of the Suruga seamount (14–17°N, 142–143°E), near the Mariana Islands. and their leptocephali are then transported to the west to East Asia by the North Equatorial Current.

In June and August 2008, Japanese scientists discovered and caught matured adult eels of &quot;A. japonica&quot; and &quot;A. marmorata&quot; in the West Mariana Ridge.

===Southern African eels===
Southern Africa&#x27;s four species of freshwater eels (&quot;A. mossambica&quot;, &quot;A. bicolor bicolor&quot;, &quot;A. bengalensis labiata&quot;, and &quot;A. marmorata&quot;) have an interesting migratory pattern: It takes them on a long journey from their spawning grounds in the Indian Ocean north of Madagascar to high up in some of the Southern African river systems and then back again to the ocean off Madagascar.

===New Zealand longfin eels===
New Zealand longfin eels breed only once at the end of their lives, making a journey of thousands of kilometres from New Zealand to their spawning grounds near Tonga. Their eggs (of which each female eel produces between 1 and 20 million) are fertilized in an unknown manner, but probably in deep tropical water. The mature eels then die, their eggs floating to the surface to hatch into very flat leaf-like larvae (called leptocephalus) that then drift along large oceanic currents back to New Zealand. This drifting is thought to take up to 15 months. There have been no recorded captures of either the eggs or larvae of longfin eels.

== Decline of the glass eels ==

For unknown reasons, beginning in the mid-1980s, glass eel arrival in the spring dropped drastically—in Germany to 10% and in France to 14% of their previous levels—from even conservative estimates. Data from Maine and other North American coasts showed similar declines, although not as drastic.

In 1997, European demand for eels could not be met for the first time ever, and dealers from Asia bought all they could. The traditional European stocking programs could not compete any longer: each week, the price for a kilogram of glass eel went up another US$30. Even before the 1997 generation hit the coasts of Europe, dealers from China alone placed advance orders for more than 250,000 kg, some bidding more than $1,100 per kg. Asian elvers have sold in Hong Kong for as much as $5,000 to $6,000 a kilogram at times when $1,000 would buy the same amount of American glass eels at their catching sites. Such a kilogram, consisting of 5000 glass eels, may bring at least $60,000 and as much as $150,000 after they leave an Asian fish farm. In New Jersey, over 2000 licenses for glass eel catch were issued and reports of 38 kg per night and fisherman have been made, although the average catch is closer to 1 kg.

Glass eels have been harvested for food from the River Severn, England, for centuries, but for about 200 years, from the sixteenth to eighteenth century, the practice was outlawed by act of Parliament. The restriction was removed in 1873 and in 1908 a collection point and holding station for the catch was established at Epney, Gloucestershire. Initially the crop was sold for human consumption but, as infrastructure for live transport improved, the glass eels were exported throughout Europe for stocking natural waterways and to the Far East for eel aquaculture.

The demand for adult eels has continued to grow, . Germany imported more than $50 million worth of eels in 2002. In Europe, 25 million kg are consumed each year, but in Japan alone, more than 100 million kg were consumed in 1996. As the European eels become less available, worldwide interest in American eels has increased dramatically.

New high-tech eel aquaculture plants are appearing in Asia, with possible effects on the native Japanese eel, &quot;A. japonica&quot;. Traditional eel aquaculture operations rely on wild-caught elvers, but experimental hormone treatments in Japan have led to artificially spawned eels. Eggs from these treated eels have a diameter of about 1 mm, and each female can produce up to 10 million eggs. However, these treated eels may not solve the eel crisis. Scientists are struggling to get eels to sexual maturity without environmental cues. Additionally, leptocephali (larva) require a diet of marine snow which is difficult to recreate in aquaculture.

== Threats to eels ==

Strong concerns exist that the European eel population might be devastated by a new threat: &quot;Anguillicola crassus&quot;, a foreign parasitic nematode. This parasite from East Asia (the original host is &quot;A. japonica&quot;) appeared in European eel populations in the early 1980s. Since 1995, it also appeared in the United States (Texas and South Carolina), most likely due to uncontrolled aquaculture eel shipments. In Europe, eel populations are already from 30% to 100% infected with the nematode. Recently, this parasite was shown to inhibit the function of the swimbladder as a hydrostatic organ. As open ocean voyagers, eels need the carrying capacity of the swimbladder (which makes up 3–6% of the eel&#x27;s body weight) to cross the ocean on stored energy alone.

Because the eels are catadromous (living in fresh water but spawning in the sea), dams and other river obstructions can block their ability to reach inland feeding grounds. Since the 1970s, an increasing number of eel ladders have been constructed in North America and Europe to help the fish bypass obstructions.

As of the early 2000s, in New Jersey, the Long-term Ecosystem Observatory was monitoring glass eel migration with a planned online &quot;in situ&quot; microscope.

<doc id="235651" wikidata="Q2600973" url="?curid=235651" title="Operation Keelhaul">
<text>Operation Keelhaul was a forced repatriation of Soviet citizens and members of the Soviet Army in the West to the Soviet Union (although it often included former soldiers of the Russian Empire or Russian Republic, who did not have Soviet citizenship) after World War II. While forced repatriation focused on Soviet Armed Forces POWs of Germany and Russian Liberation Army members, it included many other people under Allied control. Refoulement, the forced repatriation of people in danger of persecution, is a human rights violation and breach of international law. Thus Operation Keelhaul would have been called a war crime under modern international humanitarian law, especially in regards to the many civilians forced into Soviet work camps, many of whom had never been Soviet citizens, having fled Russia before the end of the Russian Civil War.

The operation was carried out in Northern Italy and Germany by British and American forces between 14 August 1946 and 9 May 1947. Anti-communist Yugoslavs and Hungarians, including members of the fascist Ustaše regime that ran the Jasenovac concentration camp, were also forcibly repatriated to their respective governments.

Three volumes of records, entitled &quot;Forcible Repatriation of Displaced Soviet Citizens-Operation Keelhaul,&quot; were classified Top Secret by the U.S. Army on September 18, 1948, and bear the secret file number 383.7-14.1.

==Yalta Conference==
One of the conclusions of the Yalta Conference was that the western Allies would return all Soviet citizens who found themselves in their zones to the Soviet Union. This immediately affected the liberated Soviet prisoners of war, but also extended to all Soviet citizens, irrespective of their wishes. In exchange, the Soviet government agreed to hand over several thousand western Allied prisoners of war whom they had liberated from German prisoner of war camps.

==Treatment of prisoners and refugees==
The refugee columns fleeing the Soviet-occupied parts of Europe included anti-communists, civilians, and Nazi collaborators from eastern European countries. They added to the mass of &#x27;displaced persons&#x27; from the Soviet Union already in Western Europe, the vast majority of whom were Soviet prisoners of war and forced laborers (Ost-Arbeiter).

Soviet subjects who had volunteered for the German Army &quot;Ostlegionen&quot; and/or &quot;Waffen SS&quot; units were forcibly repatriated. These included Russian Cossacks of the XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps with their relatives, who were transported from the Western occupation zones of Allied-occupied Austria to the Soviet occupation zones of Austria and Allied-occupied Germany. Among those handed over were White émigré-Russians who had never been Soviet citizens. Some of them had fought for Nazi Germany against the Soviets during the war, including General Andrei Shkuro and the &quot;Ataman&quot; of the Don Cossack host Pyotr Krasnov. This was done despite the official statement of the British Foreign Office policy after the Yalta Conference, that only Soviet citizens who had been such after 1 September 1939 were to be compelled to return to the Soviet Union or handed over to Soviet officials in other locations (see the Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II).

The actual &quot;Operation Keelhaul&quot; was the last forced repatriation and involved the selection and subsequent transfer of approximately one thousand &quot;Russians&quot; from the camps of Bagnoli, Aversa, Pisa, and Riccione. Applying the &quot;McNarney-Clark Directive&quot;, subjects who had served in the German Army were selected for shipment, starting on 14 August 1946. The transfer was codenamed &quot;East Wind&quot; and took place at St. Valentin in Austria on 8 and 9 May 1947. This operation marked the end of forced repatriations to the Soviet Union after World War II, and ran parallel to &quot;Operation Fling&quot; that helped Soviet defectors to escape from the Soviet Union.

On the other side of the exchange, the Soviet leadership found out that despite the demands set forth by Stalin, British intelligence was retaining a number of anti-Communist prisoners under orders from Churchill, with the intention of reviving &quot;anti-Soviet operations&quot;. The 14th Waffen Grenadier Division, recruited from Ukrainians in Galicia, was not repatriated, ostensibly because Galicia had belonged to Poland prior to September 1939, but in reality because MI6 wished to use the prisoners in future operations. The officer in charge of screening the 14th Division for war criminals, Fitzroy Maclean, admitted in an interview in 1989 that it was &quot;fairly clear that there was every probability that there were war criminals amongst them&quot;, but argued that in the context of the Cold War, such men were needed to fight against the Soviet Union. On 23 March 1947, the United Kingdom granted asylum to the entire 14th Division, whose men were subsequently settled in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The Soviet government protested against this decision, stating that most of the men in the division had previously served in German police units in Galicia and were deeply involved in perpetrating war crimes, but using a brief written by Pavlo Shandruk, an officer in the division as its basis, the Foreign Office issued a statement denying the 14th division had been involved in war crimes.

==Critics==
British historian Nikolai Tolstoy described the scene of Americans returning to the internment camp after delivering a shipment of people to the Soviet authorities: &quot;The Americans returned to Plattling visibly shamefaced. Before their departure from the rendezvous in the forest, many had seen rows of bodies already hanging from the branches of nearby trees.&quot; Notably, his accounts have been widely disputed by historians, who pointed out his reliance on three partial eyewitness accounts 40 years afterwards.

Nigel Nicolson, a former British Army captain, was Tolstoy&#x27;s chief witness in the libel action brought by Lord Aldington. In 1995, he wrote: 
Fifty years ago I was a captain in the British Army, and with others I supervised the Jugoslav (Yugoslav) &#x27;repatriation&#x27;, as it was euphemistically called. We were told not to use force, and forbidden to inform them of their true destination. When they asked us where they were going, we replied that we were transferring them to another British camp in Italy, and they mounted the trains without suspicion. As soon as the sliding doors of the cattle-trucks were padlocked, our soldiers withdrew and Tito&#x27;s partisans emerged from the station building where they had been hiding, and took over command of the train.

The prisoners and refugees could see them through cracks in the boarding, and began hammering on the insides of the wagons, shouting abuse at us for having betrayed them, lied to them, and sentenced at least the men among them to a grotesque death. There is now no doubt about their hideous fate, and to those of us on the spot there was little doubt then. Shortly after the first trainloads had been despatched, we heard the stories of the few survivors who escaped back to Austria, and thousands of manacled skeletons have since been disinterred in Slovenian pits.

Ghinghis Guirey, an American on one of the repatriation screening teams, reported:
The most unpleasant aspect of this unpleasant business was the fear these people displayed. Involuntarily one began to look over one&#x27;s shoulder. I heard so many threats to commit suicide from people who feared repatriation that it became almost commonplace. And they were not fooling.

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn called this operation &quot;the last secret of World War II.&quot; He contributed to a legal defense fund set up to help Tolstoy, who was sued for libel in a 1989 case brought by Lord Aldington over war crimes allegations made by Tolstoy related to this operation. Tolstoy lost the case in the British courts. He initially avoided paying damages by declaring bankruptcy, but was forced to pay £57,000 to Aldington&#x27;s estate in 2000.

<text>Corporate governance refers to the mechanisms, processes, practices, and relations by which corporations are controlled and operated by their boards of directors, managers, shareholders, and stakeholders.

==Definitions==
&quot;Corporate governance&quot; may be defined, described or delineated in diverse ways, depending on the writer&#x27;s purpose. Writers focused on a disciplinary interest or context (such as accounting, finance, law, or management) often adopt narrow definitions that appear purpose-specific. Writers concerned with regulatory policy in relation to corporate governance practices often use broader structural descriptions. A broad (meta) definition that encompasses many adopted definitions is &quot;Corporate governance describes the processes, structures, and mechanisms that influence the control and direction of corporations.&quot;

This meta definition accommodates both the narrow definitions used in specific contexts and the broader descriptions that are often presented as authoritative. The latter include the structural definition from the Cadbury Report, which identifies corporate governance as &quot;the system by which companies are directed and controlled&quot; (Cadbury 1992, p. 15); and the relational-structural view adopted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of &quot;Corporate governance involves a set of relationships between a company&#x27;s management, board, shareholders and stakeholders. Corporate governance also provides the structure and systems through which the company is directed and its objectives are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance are determined&quot; (OECD 2023, p. 6).

Examples of narrower definitions in particular contexts include:
* &quot;a system of law and sound approaches by which corporations are directed and controlled focusing on the internal and external corporate structures with the intention of monitoring the actions of management and directors and thereby, mitigating agency risks which may stem from the misdeeds of corporate officers.&quot;
* &quot;the set of conditions that shapes the &quot;ex post&quot; bargaining over the quasi-rents generated by a firm.&quot;

The firm itself is modelled as a governance structure acting through the mechanisms of contract. 
Here corporate governance may include its relation to corporate finance.

== Principles ==
Contemporary discussions of corporate governance tend to refer to principles raised in three documents released since 1990: The Cadbury Report (UK, 1992), the Principles of Corporate Governance (OECD, 1999, 2004, 2015 and 2023), and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (US, 2002). The Cadbury and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports present general principles around which businesses are expected to operate to assure proper governance. The Sarbanes–Oxley Act, informally referred to as Sarbox or Sox, is an attempt by the federal government in the United States to legislate several of the principles recommended in the Cadbury and OECD reports.
* &quot;Rights and equitable treatment of shareholders&quot;: Organizations should respect the rights of shareholders and help shareholders to exercise those rights. They can help shareholders exercise their rights by openly and effectively communicating information and by encouraging shareholders to participate in general meetings.
* &quot;Interests of other stakeholders&quot;: Organizations should recognize that they have legal, contractual, social, and market driven obligations to non-shareholder stakeholders, including employees, investors, creditors, suppliers, local communities, customers, and policymakers.
* &quot;Role and responsibilities of the board&quot;: The board needs sufficient relevant skills and understanding to review and challenge management performance. It also needs adequate size and appropriate levels of independence and commitment.
* &quot;Integrity and ethical behavior&quot;: Integrity should be a fundamental requirement in choosing corporate officers and board members. Organizations should develop a code of conduct for their directors and executives that promotes ethical and responsible decision making.
* &quot;Disclosure and transparency&quot;: Organizations should clarify and make publicly known the roles and responsibilities of board and management to provide stakeholders with a level of accountability. They should also implement procedures to independently verify and safeguard the integrity of the company&#x27;s financial reporting. Disclosure of material matters concerning the organization should be timely and balanced to ensure that all investors have access to clear, factual information.

=== Principal–agent conflict ===
Some concerns regarding governance follows from the potential for conflicts of interests that are a consequence of the non-alignment of preferences between: shareholders and upper management (principal–agent problems); and among shareholders (principal–principal problems), although also other stakeholder relations are affected and coordinated through corporate governance.

In large firms where there is a separation of ownership and management, the principal–agent problem can arise between upper-management (the &quot;agent&quot;) and the shareholder(s) (the &quot;principals&quot;). The shareholders and upper management may have different interests. The shareholders typically desire returns on their investments through profits and dividends, while upper management may also be influenced by other motives, such as management remuneration or wealth interests, working conditions and perquisites, or relationships with other parties within (e.g., management-worker relations) or outside the corporation, to the extent that these are not necessary for profits. Those pertaining to self-interest are usually emphasized in relation to principal-agent problems. The effectiveness of corporate governance practices from a shareholder perspective might be judged by how well those practices align and coordinate the interests of the upper management with those of the shareholders. However, corporations sometimes undertake initiatives, such as climate activism and voluntary emission reduction, that seems to contradict the idea that rational self-interest drives shareholders&#x27; governance goals.

An example of a possible conflict between shareholders and upper management materializes through stock repurchases (treasury stock). Executives may have incentive to divert cash surpluses to buying treasury stock to support or increase the share price. However, that reduces the financial resources available to maintain or enhance profitable operations. As a result, executives can sacrifice long-term profits for short-term personal gain. Shareholders may have different perspectives in this regard, depending on their own time preferences, but it can also be viewed as a conflict with broader corporate interests (including preferences of other stakeholders and the long-term health of the corporation).

=== Principal–principal conflict (the multiple principal problem) ===
The principal–agent problem can be intensified when upper management acts on behalf of multiple shareholders—which is often the case in large firms (see Multiple principal problem). Specifically, when upper management acts on behalf of multiple shareholders, the multiple shareholders face a collective action problem in corporate governance, as individual shareholders may lobby upper management or otherwise have incentives to act in their individual interests rather than in the collective interest of all shareholders. As a result, there may be free-riding in steering and monitoring of upper management, or conversely, high costs may arise from duplicate steering and monitoring of upper management. Conflict may break out between principals, and this all leads to increased autonomy for upper management.

Ways of mitigating or preventing these conflicts of interests include the processes, customs, policies, laws, and institutions which affect the way a company is controlled—and this is the challenge of corporate governance. To solve the problem of governing upper management under multiple shareholders, corporate governance scholars have figured out that the straightforward solution of appointing one or more shareholders for governance is likely to lead to problems because of the information asymmetry it creates. Shareholders&#x27; meetings are necessary to arrange governance under multiple shareholders, and it has been proposed that this is the solution to the problem of multiple principals due to median voter theorem: shareholders&#x27; meetings lead power to be devolved to an actor that approximately holds the median interest of all shareholders, thus causing governance to best represent the aggregated interest of all shareholders.

=== Other themes ===
An important theme of governance is the nature and extent of corporate accountability. A related discussion at the macro level focuses on the effect of a corporate governance system on economic efficiency, with a strong emphasis on shareholders&#x27; welfare. This has resulted in a literature focused on economic analysis. A comparative assessment of corporate governance principles and practices across countries was published by Aguilera and Jackson in 2011.

== Models ==
Different models of corporate governance differ according to the variety of capitalism in which they are embedded. The Anglo-American &quot;model&quot; tends to emphasize the interests of shareholders. The coordinated or multistakeholder model associated with Continental Europe and Japan also recognizes the interests of workers, managers, suppliers, customers, and the community. A related distinction is between market-oriented and network-oriented models of corporate governance.

=== Continental Europe (two-tier board system) ===

Some continental European countries, including Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, require a two-tiered board of directors as a means of improving corporate governance. In the two-tiered board, the executive board, made up of company executives, generally runs day-to-day operations while the supervisory board, made up entirely of non-executive directors who represent shareholders and employees, hires and fires the members of the executive board, determines their compensation, and reviews major business decisions.

Germany, in particular, is known for its practice of co-determination, founded on the German Codetermination Act of 1976, in which workers are granted seats on the board as stakeholders, separate from the seats accruing to shareholder equity.

=== United States, United Kingdom ===
The so-called &quot;Anglo-American model&quot; of corporate governance emphasizes the interests of shareholders. It relies on a single-tiered board of directors that is normally dominated by non-executive directors elected by shareholders. Because of this, it is also known as &quot;the unitary system&quot;. Within this system, many boards include some executives from the company (who are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the board). Non-executive directors are expected to outnumber executive directors and hold key posts, including audit and compensation committees. In the United Kingdom, the CEO generally does not also serve as chairman of the board, whereas in the US having the dual role has been the norm, despite major misgivings regarding the effect on corporate governance. The number of US firms combining both roles is declining, however.

In the United States, corporations are directly governed by state laws, while the exchange (offering and trading) of securities in corporations (including shares) is governed by federal legislation. Many US states have adopted the Model Business Corporation Act, but the dominant state law for publicly traded corporations is Delaware General Corporation Law, which continues to be the place of incorporation for the majority of publicly traded corporations. Individual rules for corporations are based upon the corporate charter and, less authoritatively, the corporate bylaws.
Shareholders cannot initiate changes in the corporate charter although they can initiate changes to the corporate bylaws.

It is sometimes colloquially stated that in the US and the UK that &quot;the shareholders own the company.&quot; This is, however, a misconception as argued by Eccles and Youmans (2015) and Kay (2015). The American system has long been based on a belief in the potential of shareholder democracy to efficiently allocate capital.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese model of corporate governance has traditionally held a broad view that firms should account for the interests of a range of stakeholders. For instance, managers do not have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. This framework is rooted in the belief that a balance among stakeholder interests can lead to a superior allocation of resources for society. The Japanese model includes several key principles:

* Security the rights and equal treatment of shareholders
* Appropriate cooperation with stakeholders (other than shareholders)
* Ensuring appropriate information disclosure and transparency
* Responsibility of the board
* Dialogue with shareholders

=== Founder centrism ===
An article published by the Australian Institute of Company Directors called &quot;Do Boards Need to become more Entrepreneurial?&quot; considered the need for founder centrism behaviour at board level to appropriately manage disruption.

== Regulation ==

Corporations are created as legal persons by the laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction. These may vary in many respects between countries, but a corporation&#x27;s legal person status is fundamental to all jurisdictions and is conferred by statute. This allows the entity to hold property in its own right without reference to any real person. It also results in the perpetual existence that characterizes the modern corporation. The statutory granting of corporate existence may arise from general purpose legislation (which is the general case) or from a statute to create a specific corporation. Now, the formation of business corporations in most jurisdictions requires government legislation that facilitates incorporation. This legislation is often in the form of Companies Act or Corporations Act, or similar. Country-specific regulatory devices are summarized below.

It is generally perceived that regulatory attention on the corporate governance practices of publicly listed corporations, particularly in relation to transparency and accountability, increased in many jurisdictions following the high-profile corporate scandals in 2001–2002, many of which involved accounting fraud; and then again after the financial crisis in 2008. For example, in the U.S., these included scandals surrounding Enron and MCI Inc. (formerly WorldCom). Their demise led to the enactment of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act in 2002, a U.S. federal law intended to improve corporate governance in the United States. Comparable failures in Australia (HIH, One.Tel) are linked to with the eventual passage of the CLERP 9 reforms there (2004), that similarly aimed to improve corporate governance. Similar corporate failures in other countries stimulated increased regulatory interest (e.g., Parmalat in Italy). Also see

In addition to legislation the facilitates incorporation, many jurisdictions have some major regulatory devices that impact on corporate governance. This includes statutory laws concerned with the functioning of stock or securities markets (also see Security (finance), consumer and competition (antitrust) laws, labour or employment laws, and environmental protection laws, which may also entail disclosure requirements. In addition to the statutory laws of the relevant jurisdiction, corporations are subject to common law in some countries.

In most jurisdictions, corporations also have some form of a corporate constitution that provides individual rules that govern the corporation and authorize or constrain its decision-makers. This constitution is identified by a variety of terms; in English-speaking jurisdictions, it is sometimes known as the corporate charter or articles of association (which also be accompanied by a memorandum of association).

== Country-specific regulation ==
=== Australia ===
==== Primary legislation ====
Incorporation in Australia originated under state legislation but has been under federal legislation since 2001. Also see Australian corporate law.
Other significant legislation includes:

=== Canada ===
==== Primary legislation ====
Incorporation in Canada can be done either under either federal or provincial legislation. See Canadian corporate law.

=== The Netherlands ===
==== Primary legislation ====
Dutch corporate law is embedded in the ondernemingsrecht and, specifically for limited liability companies, in the vennootschapsrecht.

=== Corporate Governance Code 2016-2022 ===
In addition The Netherlands has adopted a Corporate Governance Code in 2016, which has been updated twice since.
In the latest version (2022), the Executive Board of the company is held responsible for the continuity of the company and its &quot;sustainable long-term value creation&quot;.
The executive board considers the impact of corporate actions on People and Planet and takes the effects on corporate stakeholders into account. 
In the Dutch two-tier system, the Supervisory Board monitors and supervises the executive board in this respect.

=== Poland ===
==== Primary legislation ====
Polish Corporate Law is regulated in Code of Commercial Companies. The code regulates most of the aspects of corporate governance, incl. rules of incorporation and liquidation, it defines rights, obligations and rules of operations of corporate bodies (Management Board, Supervisory Board, Shareholders Meeting). 

=== UK ===
==== Primary legislation ====
The UK has a single jurisdiction for incorporation. Also see United Kingdom company law
Other significant legislation includes:

==== Bribery Act 2010 ====
The UK passed the Bribery Act in 2010. This law made it illegal to bribe either government or private citizens or make facilitating payments (i.e., payment to a government official to perform their routine duties more quickly). It also required corporations to establish controls to prevent bribery.

=== US ===
==== Primary legislation ====
Incorporation in the US is under state level legislation, but there important federal acts. in particular, see Securities Act of 1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Uniform Securities Act.

===== Sarbanes–Oxley Act =====
The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) was enacted in the wake of a series of high-profile corporate scandals, which cost investors billions of dollars. It established a series of requirements that affect corporate governance in the US and influenced similar laws in many other countries. SOX contained many other elements, but provided for several changes that are important to corporate governance practices:
* The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) be established to regulate the auditing profession, which had been self-regulated prior to the law. Auditors are responsible for reviewing the financial statements of corporations and issuing an opinion as to their reliability.
* The chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) attest to the financial statements. Prior to the law, CEOs had claimed in court they hadn&#x27;t reviewed the information as part of their defense.
* Board audit committees have members that are independent and disclose whether or not at least one is a financial expert, or reasons why no such expert is on the audit committee.
* External audit firms cannot provide certain types of consulting services and must rotate their lead partner every 5 years. Further, an audit firm cannot audit a company if those in specified senior management roles worked for the auditor in the past year. Prior to the law, there was the real or perceived conflict of interest between providing an independent opinion on the accuracy and reliability of financial statements when the same firm was also providing lucrative consulting services.

==== Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ====
The U.S. passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in 1977, with subsequent modifications. This law made it illegal to bribe government officials and required corporations to maintain adequate accounting controls. It is enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Substantial civil and criminal penalties have been levied on corporations and executives convicted of bribery.

== Codes and guidelines ==
Corporate governance principles and codes have been developed in different countries and issued from stock exchanges, corporations, institutional investors, or associations (institutes) of directors and managers with the support of governments and international organizations. As a rule, compliance with these governance recommendations is not mandated by law, although the codes linked to stock exchange listing requirements may have a coercive effect.

=== Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles ===
One of the most influential guidelines on corporate governance are the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, first published as the OECD Principles in 1999, revised in 2004, in 2015 when endorsed by the G20, and in 2023. The Principles are often referenced by countries developing local codes or guidelines. Building on the work of the OECD, other international organizations, private sector associations and more than 20 national corporate governance codes formed the United Nations Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR) to produce their Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure. This internationally agreed benchmark consists of more than fifty distinct disclosure items across five broad categories:
* Auditing
* Board and management structure and process
* Corporate responsibility and compliance in organization
* Financial transparency and information disclosure
* Ownership structure and exercise of control rights

The OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises complement the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, providing guidance tailored to the corporate governance challenges of state-owned enterprises.

=== Stock exchange listing standards ===
Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and other stock exchanges are required to meet certain governance standards. For example, the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires, among many other elements:
* Independent directors: &quot;Listed companies must have a majority of independent directors ... Effective boards of directors exercise independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities. Requiring a majority of independent directors will increase the quality of board oversight and lessen the possibility of damaging conflicts of interest.&quot; (Section 303A.01) An independent director is not part of management and has no &quot;material financial relationship&quot; with the company.
* Board meetings that exclude management: &quot;To empower non-management directors to serve as a more effective check on management, the non-management directors of each listed company must meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management.&quot; (Section 303A.03)
* Boards organize their members into committees with specific responsibilities per defined charters. &quot;Listed companies must have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors.&quot; This committee is responsible for nominating new members for the board of directors. Compensation and Audit Committees are also specified, with the latter subject to a variety of listing standards as well as outside regulations.

=== Other guidelines ===
The investor-led organisation International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) was set up by individuals centred around the ten largest pension funds in the world in 1995. The aim is to promote global corporate governance standards. The network is led by investors that manage $77 trillion US dollars, and members are located in fifty different countries. ICGN has developed a suite of global guidelines ranging from shareholder rights to business ethics.

The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) has done work on corporate governance, particularly on accounting and reporting. In 2009, the International Finance Corporation and the UN Global Compact released a report, &quot;Corporate Governance: the Foundation for Corporate Citizenship and Sustainable Business&quot;, linking the environmental, social and governance responsibilities of a company to its financial performance and long-term sustainability.

Most codes are largely voluntary. An issue raised in the U.S. since the 2005 Disney decision is the degree to which companies manage their governance responsibilities; in other words, do they merely try to supersede the legal threshold, or should they create governance guidelines that ascend to the level of best practice. For example, the guidelines issued by associations of directors, corporate managers and individual companies tend to be wholly voluntary, but such documents may have a wider effect by prompting other companies to adopt similar practices.

In 2021, the first ever international standard, ISO 37000, was published as guidance for good governance. The guidance places emphasis on purpose which is at the heart of all organizations, i.e. a meaningful reason to exist. Values inform both the purpose and the way the purpose is achieved.

== History ==
=== United States ===
Robert E. Wright argued in &quot;Corporation Nation&quot; (2014) that the governance of early U.S. corporations, of which over 20,000 existed by the Civil War of 1861–1865, was superior to that of corporations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries because early corporations governed themselves like &quot;republics&quot;, replete with numerous &quot;checks and balances&quot; against fraud and against usurpation of power by managers or by large shareholders. (The term &quot;robber baron&quot; became particularly associated with US corporate figures in the Gilded Age—the late 19th century.)

In the immediate aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 legal scholars such as Adolf Augustus Berle, Edwin Dodd, and Gardiner C. Means pondered on the changing role of the modern corporation in society. From the Chicago school of economics, Ronald Coase introduced the notion of transaction costs into the understanding of why firms are founded and how they continue to behave.

US economic expansion through the emergence of multinational corporations after World War II (1939–1945) saw the establishment of the managerial class. Several Harvard Business School management professors studied and wrote about the new class: Myles Mace (entrepreneurship), Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. (business history), Jay Lorsch (organizational behavior) and Elizabeth MacIver (organizational behavior). According to Lorsch and MacIver &quot;many large corporations have dominant control over business affairs without sufficient accountability or monitoring by their board of directors&quot;.

In the 1980s, Eugene Fama and Michael Jensen established the principal–agent problem as a way of understanding corporate governance: the firm is seen as a series of contracts.

In the period from 1977 to 1997, corporate directors&#x27; duties in the U.S. expanded beyond their traditional legal responsibility of duty of loyalty to the corporation and to its shareholders. 

In the first half of the 1990s, the issue of corporate governance in the U.S. received considerable press attention due to a spate of CEO dismissals (for example, at IBM, Kodak, and Honeywell) by their boards. The California Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System (CalPERS) led a wave of &quot;institutional&quot; shareholder activism (something only very rarely seen before), as a way of ensuring that corporate value would not be destroyed by the now traditionally cozy relationships between the CEO and the board of directors (for example, by the unrestrained issuance of stock options, not infrequently back-dated).

In the early 2000s, the massive bankruptcies (and criminal malfeasance) of Enron and Worldcom, as well as lesser corporate scandals (such as those involving Adelphia Communications, AOL, Arthur Andersen, Global Crossing, and Tyco) led to increased political interest in corporate governance. This was reflected in the passage of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002. Other triggers for continued interest in the corporate governance of organizations included the financial crisis of 2008/9 and the level of CEO pay.

Some corporations have tried to burnish their ethical image by creating whistle-blower protections, such as anonymity. This varies significantly by justification, company and sector.

=== East Asia ===
In 1997 the East Asian Financial Crisis severely affected the economies of Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines through the exit of foreign capital after property assets collapsed. The lack of corporate governance mechanisms in these countries highlighted the weaknesses of the institutions in their economies.

In the 1990s, China established the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to improve corporate governance. Despite these efforts, state ownership concentration and governance issues such as board independence and insider trading persisted.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In November 2006 the Capital Market Authority (Saudi Arabia) (CMA) issued a corporate governance code in the Arabic language. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made considerable progress with respect to the implementation of viable and culturally appropriate governance mechanisms (Al-Hussain &amp; Johnson, 2009).

Al-Hussain, A. and Johnson, R. (2009) found a strong relationship between the efficiency of corporate governance structure and Saudi bank performance when using return on assets as a performance measure with one exception—that government and local ownership groups were not significant. However, using rate of return as a performance measure revealed a weak positive relationship between the efficiency of corporate governance structure and bank performance.

== Stakeholders ==
Key parties involved in corporate governance include stakeholders such as the board of directors, management and shareholders. External stakeholders such as creditors, auditors, customers, suppliers, government agencies, and the community at large also exert influence. The agency view of the corporation posits that the shareholder forgoes decision rights (control) and entrusts the manager to act in the shareholders&#x27; best (joint) interests. Partly as a result of this separation between the two investors and managers, corporate governance mechanisms include a system of controls intended to help align managers&#x27; incentives with those of shareholders. Agency concerns (risk) are necessarily lower for a controlling shareholder.

In private for-profit corporations, shareholders elect the board of directors to represent their interests. In the case of nonprofits, stakeholders may have some role in recommending or selecting board members, but typically the board itself decides who will serve on the board as a &#x27;self-perpetuating&#x27; board. The degree of leadership that the board has over the organization varies; in practice at large organizations, the executive management, principally the CEO, drives major initiatives with the oversight and approval of the board.

=== Responsibilities of the board of directors ===
Former Chairman of the Board of General Motors John G. Smale wrote in 1995: &quot;The board is responsible for the successful perpetuation of the corporation. That responsibility cannot be relegated to management.&quot; A board of directors is expected to play a key role in corporate governance. The board has responsibility for: CEO selection and succession; providing feedback to management on the organization&#x27;s strategy; compensating senior executives; monitoring financial health, performance and risk; and ensuring accountability of the organization to its investors and authorities. Boards typically have several committees (e.g., Compensation, Nominating and Audit) to perform their work.

The OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (2025) describe the responsibilities of the board; some of these are summarized below:
* Board members should act on a fully informed basis, in good faith, with due diligence and care, and in the best interest of the company and the shareholders, taking into account the interests of stakeholders.
* Where board decisions may affect different shareholder groups differently, the board should treat all shareholders fairly.
* The board should apply high ethical standards. 
* The board should fulfil certain key functions, including: 
** Reviewing and guiding corporate strategy, major plans of action, annual budgets and business plans; setting performance objectives; monitoring implementation and corporate performance; and overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestitures.
** Reviewing and assessing risk management policies and procedures.
** Monitoring the effectiveness of the company&#x27;s governance practices and making changes as needed.
** Selecting, overseeing and monitoring the performance of key executives, and, when necessary, replacing them and overseeing succession planning.
** Aligning key executive and board remuneration with the longer term interests of the company and its shareholders.
** Ensuring a formal and transparent board nomination and election process.
** Monitoring and managing potential conflicts of interest of management, board members and shareholders, including misuse of corporate assets and abuse in related party transactions.
** Ensuring the integrity of the corporation&#x27;s accounting and reporting systems for disclosure, including the independent external audit, and that appropriate control systems are in place, in compliance with the law and relevant standards.
** Overseeing the process of disclosure and communications.
* The board should be able to exercise objective independent judgement on corporate affairs.
* In order to fulfil their responsibilities, board members should have access to accurate, relevant and timely information.
* When employee representation on the board is mandated, mechanisms should be developed to facilitate access to information and training for employee representatives, so that this representation is exercised effectively and best contributes to the enhancement of board skills, information and independence.

=== Stakeholder interests ===
All parties, not just shareholders, to corporate governance have an interest, whether direct or indirect, in the financial performance of the corporation. Directors, workers and management receive salaries, benefits and reputation, while investors expect to receive financial returns. For lenders, it is specified interest payments, while returns to equity investors arise from dividend distributions or capital gains on their stock. Customers are concerned with the certainty of the provision of goods and services of an appropriate quality; suppliers are concerned with compensation for their goods or services, and possible continued trading relationships. These parties provide value to the corporation in the form of financial, physical, human and other forms of capital. Many parties may also be concerned with corporate social performance.

A key factor in a party&#x27;s decision to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party&#x27;s expected outcomes. When categories of parties (stakeholders) do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed in a manner consistent with their desired outcomes, they are less likely to engage with the corporation. When this becomes an endemic system feature, the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders, and increases the likelihood of political action. There is substantial interest in how external systems and institutions, including markets, influence corporate governance.

=== &quot;Absentee landlords&quot; vs. capital stewards ===
In 2016 the director of the World Pensions Council (WPC) said that &quot;institutional asset owners now seem more eager to take to task [the] negligent CEOs&quot; of the companies whose shares they own.

This development is part of a broader trend towards more fully exercised asset ownership—notably from the part of the boards of directors (&#x27;trustees&#x27;) of large UK, Dutch, Scandinavian and Canadian pension investors:

This could eventually put more pressure on the CEOs of publicly listed companies, as &quot;more than ever before, many [North American,] UK and European Union pension trustees speak enthusiastically about flexing their fiduciary muscles for the UN&#x27;s Sustainable Development Goals&quot;, and other ESG-centric investment practices.

==== United Kingdom ====
In Britain, &quot;The widespread social disenchantment that followed the [2008–2012] great recession had an impact&quot; on all stakeholders, including pension fund board members and investment managers.

Many of the UK&#x27;s largest pension funds are thus already active stewards of their assets, engaging with corporate boards and speaking up when they think it is necessary.

=== Control and ownership structures ===
Control and ownership structure refers to the types and composition of shareholders in a corporation. In some countries such as most of Continental Europe, ownership is not necessarily equivalent to control due to the existence of e.g. dual-class shares, ownership pyramids, voting coalitions, proxy votes and clauses in the articles of association that confer additional voting rights to long-term shareholders. Ownership is typically defined as the ownership of cash flow rights whereas control refers to ownership of control or voting rights. Researchers often &quot;measure&quot; control and ownership structures by using some observable measures of control and ownership concentration or the extent of inside control and ownership. Some features or types of control and ownership structure involving corporate groups include pyramids, cross-shareholdings, rings, and webs. German &quot;concerns&quot; (Konzern) are legally recognized corporate groups with complex structures. Japanese keiretsu (系列) and South Korean chaebol (which tend to be family-controlled) are corporate groups which consist of complex interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. Cross-shareholding is an essential feature of keiretsu and chaebol groups. Corporate engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders can differ substantially across different control and ownership structures.

==== Difference in firm size ====
In smaller companies founder‐owners often play a pivotal role in shaping corporate value systems that influence companies for years to come. In larger companies that separate ownership and control, managers and boards come to play an influential role. This is in part due to the distinction between employees and shareholders in large firms, where labour forms part of the corporate organization to which it belongs whereas shareholders, creditors and investors act outside of the organization of interest.

==== Family control ====
Family interests dominate ownership and control structures of some corporations, and it has been suggested that the oversight of family-controlled corporations are superior to corporations &quot;controlled&quot; by institutional investors (or with such diverse share ownership that they are controlled by management). A 2003 &quot;Business Week&quot; study said: &quot;Forget the celebrity CEO. Look beyond Six Sigma and the latest technology fad. One of the biggest strategic advantages a company can have, it turns out, is blood lines.&quot; A 2007 study by Credit Suisse found that European companies in which &quot;the founding family or manager retains a stake of more than 10 per cent of the company&#x27;s capital enjoyed a superior performance over their respective sectoral peers&quot;, reported &quot;Financial Times&quot;. Since 1996, this superior performance amounted to 8% per year.

==== Diffuse shareholders ====
The significance of institutional investors varies substantially across countries. In developed Anglo-American countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, U.K., U.S.), institutional investors dominate the market for stocks in larger corporations. While the majority of the shares in the Japanese market are held by financial companies and industrial corporations, these are not institutional investors if their holdings are largely with-on group.

The largest funds of invested money or the largest investment management firm for corporations are designed to maximize the benefits of diversified investment by investing in a very large number of different corporations with sufficient liquidity. The idea is this strategy will largely eliminate individual firm financial or other risk. A consequence of this approach is that these investors have relatively little interest in the governance of a particular corporation. It is often assumed that, if institutional investors pressing for changes decide they will likely be costly because of &quot;golden handshakes&quot; or the effort required, they will simply sell out their investment.

=== Proxy access ===

Particularly in the United States, proxy access allows shareholders to nominate candidates which appear on the proxy statement, as opposed to restricting that power to the nominating committee. The SEC had attempted a proxy access rule for decades, and the United States Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act specifically allowed the SEC to rule on this issue, however, the rule was struck down in court. Beginning in 2015, proxy access rules began to spread driven by initiatives from major institutional investors, and as of 2018, 71% of S&amp;P 500 companies had a proxy access rule.

== Mechanisms and controls ==
Corporate governance mechanisms and controls are designed to reduce the inefficiencies that arise from moral hazard and adverse selection. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems. Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) in the case of privately held companies or a firm belonging to a business group. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers&#x27; behavior occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the external auditor) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing incentive alignment toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.

=== Internal corporate governance controls ===
Internal corporate governance controls monitor activities and then take corrective actions to accomplish organisational goals. Examples include:
* &quot;Monitoring by the board of directors&quot;: The board of directors, with its legal authority to hire, fire and compensate top management, safeguards invested capital. Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified, discussed and avoided. Whilst non-executive directors are thought to be more independent, they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance. Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm&#x27;s executives is a function of its access to information. Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate top management on the basis of the quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, &quot;ex ante&quot;. It could be argued, therefore, that executive directors look beyond the financial criteria.
* &quot;Internal control procedures and internal auditors&quot;: Internal control procedures are policies implemented by an entity&#x27;s board of directors, audit committee, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance of the entity achieving its objectives related to reliable financial reporting, operating efficiency, and compliance with laws and regulations. Internal auditors are personnel within an organization who test the design and implementation of the entity&#x27;s internal control procedures and the reliability of its financial reporting.
* &quot;Balance of power&quot;: The simplest balance of power is very common; require that the president be a different person from the treasurer. This application of separation of power is further developed in companies where separate divisions check and balance each other&#x27;s actions. One group may propose company-wide administrative changes, another group review and can veto the changes, and a third group check that the interests of people (customers, shareholders, employees) outside the three groups are being met.
* &quot;Remuneration&quot;: Performance-based remuneration is designed to relate some proportion of salary to individual performance. It may be in the form of cash or non-cash payments such as shares and share options, superannuation or other benefits. Such incentive schemes, however, are reactive in the sense that they provide no mechanism for preventing mistakes or opportunistic behavior, and can elicit myopic behavior.
* &quot;Monitoring by large shareholders&quot; and/or &quot;monitoring by banks and other large creditors&quot;: Given their large investment in the firm, these stakeholders have the incentives, combined with the right degree of control and power, to monitor the management.

In publicly traded U.S. corporations, boards of directors are largely &quot;chosen&quot; by the president/CEO, and the president/CEO often takes the chair of the board position for him/herself (which makes it much more difficult for the institutional owners to &quot;fire&quot; him/her). The practice of the CEO also being the chair of the Board is fairly common in large American corporations.

While this practice is common in the U.S., it is relatively rare elsewhere. In the U.K., successive codes of best practice have recommended against duality.

=== External corporate governance controls ===
External corporate governance controls the external stakeholders&#x27; exercise over the organization. Examples include:
* competition
* debt covenants
* demand for and assessment of performance information (especially financial statements)
* government regulations
* managerial labour market
* media pressure
* takeovers
* proxy firms
* mergers and acquisitions

=== Financial reporting and the independent auditor ===
The board of directors has primary responsibility for the corporation&#x27;s internal and external financial reporting functions. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer are crucial participants, and boards usually have a high degree of reliance on them for the integrity and supply of accounting information. They oversee the internal accounting systems, and are dependent on the corporation&#x27;s accountants and internal auditors.

Current accounting rules under International Accounting Standards and U.S. GAAP allow managers some choice in determining the methods of measurement and criteria for recognition of various financial reporting elements. The potential exercise of this choice to improve apparent performance increases the information risk for users. Financial reporting fraud, including non-disclosure and deliberate falsification of values also contributes to users&#x27; information risk. To reduce this risk and to enhance the perceived integrity of financial reports, corporation financial reports must be audited by an independent external auditor who issues a report that accompanies the financial statements.

One area of concern is whether the auditing firm acts as both the independent auditor and management consultant to the firm they are auditing. This may result in a conflict of interest which places the integrity of financial reports in doubt due to client pressure to appease management. The power of the corporate client to initiate and terminate management consulting services and, more fundamentally, to select and dismiss accounting firms contradicts the concept of an independent auditor. Changes enacted in the United States in the form of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (following numerous corporate scandals, culminating with the Enron scandal) prohibit accounting firms from providing both auditing and management consulting services. Similar provisions are in place under clause 49 of Standard Listing Agreement in India.

== Systems perspective ==

A basic comprehension of corporate positioning on the market can be found by looking at which market area or areas a corporation acts in, and which stages of the respective value chain for that market area or areas it encompasses.

A corporation may from time to time decide to alter or change its market positioning – through M&amp;A activity for example – however it may loose some or all of its market efficiency in the process due to commercial operations depending to a large extent on its ability to account for a specific positioning on the market.

=== Systemic problems ===
* Demand for information: In order to influence the directors, the shareholders must combine with others to form a voting group which can pose a real threat of carrying resolutions or appointing directors at a general meeting.
* Monitoring costs: A barrier to shareholders using good information is the cost of processing it, especially to a small shareholder. The traditional answer to this problem is the efficient-market hypothesis (in finance, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) asserts that financial markets are efficient), which suggests that the small shareholder will free ride on the judgments of larger professional investors.
* Supply of accounting information: Financial accounts form a crucial link in enabling providers of finance to monitor directors. Imperfections in the financial reporting process will cause imperfections in the effectiveness of corporate governance. This should, ideally, be corrected by the working of the external auditing process.

== Issues ==

=== Sustainability ===
Well-designed corporate governance policies also support the sustainability and resilience of corporations and in turn, may contribute to the sustainability and resilience of the broader economy. Investors have increasingly expanded their focus on companies’ financial performance to include the financial risks and opportunities posed by broader economic, environmental and societal challenges, and companies’ resilience to and management of those risks. In some jurisdictions, policy makers also focus on how companies’ operations may contribute to addressing such challenges. A sound framework for corporate governance with respect to sustainability matters can help companies recognise and respond to the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders, as well as contribute to their own long-term success. Such a framework should include the disclosure of material sustainability-related information that is reliable, consistent and comparable, including related to climate change. In some cases, jurisdictions may interpret concepts of sustainability-related disclosure and materiality in terms of applicable standards articulating information that a reasonable shareholder needs in order to make investment or voting decisions.

=== Executive pay ===

Increasing attention and regulation (as under the Swiss referendum &quot;against corporate rip-offs&quot; of 2013) has been brought to executive pay levels since the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Research on the relationship between firm performance and executive compensation does not identify consistent and significant relationships between executives&#x27; remuneration and firm performance. Not all firms experience the same levels of agency conflict, and external and internal monitoring devices may be more effective for some than for others. Some researchers have found that the largest CEO performance incentives came from ownership of the firm&#x27;s shares, while other researchers found that the relationship between share ownership and firm performance was dependent on the level of ownership. The results suggest that increases in ownership above 20% cause management to become more entrenched, and less interested in the welfare of their shareholders.

Some argue that firm performance is positively associated with share option plans and that these plans direct managers&#x27; energies and extend their decision horizons toward the long-term, rather than the short-term, performance of the company. However, that point of view came under substantial criticism circa in the wake of various security scandals including mutual fund timing episodes and, in particular, the backdating of option grants as documented by University of Iowa academic Erik Lie and reported by James Blander and Charles Forelle of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Even before the negative influence on public opinion caused by the 2006 backdating scandal, use of options faced various criticisms. A particularly forceful and long running argument concerned the interaction of executive options with corporate stock repurchase programs. Numerous authorities (including U.S. Federal Reserve Board economist Weisbenner) determined options may be employed in concert with stock buybacks in a manner contrary to shareholder interests. These authors argued that, in part, corporate stock buybacks for U.S. Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s 500 companies surged to a $500 billion annual rate in late 2006 because of the effect of options.

A combination of accounting changes and governance issues led options to become a less popular means of remuneration as 2006 progressed, and various alternative implementations of buybacks surfaced to challenge the dominance of &quot;open market&quot; cash buybacks as the preferred means of implementing a share repurchase plan.

=== Separation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles ===
Shareholders elect a board of directors, who in turn hire a chief executive officer (CEO) to lead management. The primary responsibility of the board relates to the selection and retention of the CEO. However, in many U.S. corporations the CEO and chairman of the board roles are held by the same person. This creates an inherent conflict of interest between management and the board.

Critics of combined roles argue the two roles that should be separated to avoid the conflict of interest and more easily enable a poorly performing CEO to be replaced. Warren Buffett wrote in 2014: &quot;In my service on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I&#x27;ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocre CEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)&quot;

Advocates argue that empirical studies do not indicate that separation of the roles improves stock market performance and that it should be up to shareholders to determine what corporate governance model is appropriate for the firm.

In 2004, 73.4% of U.S. companies had combined roles; this fell to 57.2% by May 2012. Many U.S. companies with combined roles have appointed a &quot;Lead Director&quot; to improve independence of the board from management. German and UK companies have generally split the roles in nearly 100% of listed companies. Empirical evidence does not indicate one model is superior to the other in terms of performance. However, one study indicated that poorly performing firms tend to remove separate CEOs more frequently than when the CEO/Chair roles are combined.

=== Shareholder apathy ===
Certain groups of shareholders may become disinterested in the corporate governance process, potentially creating a power vacuum in corporate power. Insiders, other shareholders, and stakeholders may take advantage of these situations to exercise greater influence and extract rents from the corporation. Shareholder apathy may result from the increasing popularity of passive investing, diversification, and investment vehicles such as mutual funds and ETFs.

<doc id="235662" wikidata="Q205762" url="?curid=235662" title="Goulash">
<text>Goulash () is a soup made of meat and vegetables seasoned with paprika and other spices. Originating in Hungary, goulash is a common meal predominantly eaten in Central Europe but also in other parts of Europe. It is one of the national dishes of Hungary and a symbol of the country.

Its origins may be traced back as far as the 10th century to stews eaten by Hungarian shepherds. At that time, the cooked and flavored meat was dried with the help of the sun and packed into bags produced from sheep&#x27;s stomachs, needing only water to make it into a meal. Earlier versions of goulash did not include paprika, as it was not introduced to Europe until the 16th century.

==Etymology==
The name originates from the Hungarian . The word means &#x27;herd of cattle&#x27; in Hungarian, and means &#x27;cattle herder&#x27; or &#x27;cowboy&#x27;.

The word originally meant only &#x27;cattle herder&#x27;, but over time the dish became (&#x27;goulash meat&#x27;) – that is to say, a meat dish which was prepared by herdsmen. In medieval times, the Hungarian herdsman of Central Europe made use of every possible part of the animal, as was common practice. As meat was scarce, nearly all of the animal was often used to make the soup.

Today, refers both to the herdsmen, and to the soup or stew. From the Middle Ages until well into the 19th century, the Puszta was the home of enormous herds of cattle. They were driven, in their tens of thousands, to Europe&#x27;s biggest cattle markets in Moravia, Vienna, Nuremberg and Venice. The herdsmen made sure that there were always some cattle that had to be slaughtered along the way, the flesh of which provided them with .

==In Hungary==

In Hungarian cuisine, traditional , , and are dishes which evolved from the food of the cattle herders of the Hungarian plains.

In present-day Hungary, gulyás is known as a soup. It is also called gulyásleves, which translates to gulyás soup, although gulyás is understood commonly as a soup without specifying. While it may have more solid parts than broth and some versions may be called by English speakers a stew, the Hungarian language makes a strict distinction between stews and gulyás. The dish simply called gulyás is quite conservative with very little variations through the country. The basic ingredients include beef, onions, paprika, caraway seeds, potatoes, carrots and fresh noodles added directly to the soup (csipetke). Altered versions got their own name, like babgulyás which has beans or hamisgulyás which is meatless. Bográcsgulyás means a gulyás prepared traditionally in a kettle, called bogrács, outdoors, over open fire. It is a popular way of cooking out in Hungary. It can be prepared anywhere because it needs only the bogrács, an iron tripod, a chain and a campfire. Every type of gulyás is a strictly one pot dish and considered a main course, even if it is a more soupy version. 
Except for , Hungarian stews do not rely on flour or roux for thickening. Original Hungarian recipes rarely use tomatoes and only in small quantities, the deep red colors come all from the authentic Hungarian paprika spice.

Modern gulyás is made from beef, while the original herdsmen had more access to mutton. Typical cuts include the shank, shin, or shoulder; in Hungary beef from older cattle is more common, which makes tastier broth but takes a longer time to cook. Meat is cut into chunks, seasoned with salt, and then browned with sliced onion in a pot with oil or lard. Paprika is added, along with water. After the gulyás is left to simmer. After cooking a while, whole or ground caraway seed, and soup vegetables like potato, carrot, parsley root are added. However, paprika and potatoes are post-16th century additions, while gulyás traces its origin back to the Hungarians nomadic past. At the end small egg noodles called csipetke can be added. The name comes from pinching small, fingernail-sized bits out of fresh dough ( being Hungarian for &#x27;pinch&#x27;) before adding them to the boiling soup. Stew-like versions of gulyás are made the same way with letting the broth simmering down. 
Restaurants use altered recipes, where the extreme long cooking time is replaced with broth, and the csipetke noodles is substituted by nokedli.

International Goulash is a dish closer to the Hungarian dish Pörkölt, a stew which evolved from the original gulyás. After the former herdsmen&#x27;s dish became popular through the whole Hungarian society variations arose which were not following anymore the techniques used for outdoor cooking. Nokedli - which is a Hungarian version of the traditional German noodle Spaetzle - became a side dish for stews. Nokedli is made by grating liquid dough into boiling water.

===Hungarian varieties===

Hungarian goulash variations include: 
* Bográcsgulyás. Same ingredients as but with much less water so that it is stew like. 
* &quot;Székely Gulyás&quot;. Omit the potatoes and add sauerkraut and sour cream.
* &quot;Gulyás Hungarian Plain Style&quot;. Omit the homemade soup pasta (&quot;csipetke&quot;) and add vegetables.https://timeaskitchen.com/traditional-hungarian-goulash-recipe/
* &quot;Mock Gulyás&quot;. Substitute beef bones for the meat and add vegetables. Also called &quot;Hamisgulyás&quot; (fake goulash)
* &quot;Bean Gulyás&quot;. Omit the potatoes and the caraway seeds. Use kidney beans instead.
* &quot;Csángó Gulyás&quot;. Add sauerkraut instead of pasta and potatoes.
* &quot;Betyár Gulyás&quot;. Use smoked beef or smoked pork for meat.
* &quot;Likócsi Pork Gulyás&quot;. Use pork and thin vermicelli in the goulash instead of potato and soup pasta. Flavour with lemon juice.
* &quot;Mutton Gulyás&quot; or &quot;Birkagulyás&quot;. Made with mutton. Add red wine for flavour.
A thicker and richer goulash, similar to a stew, originally made with three kinds of meat, is called &quot;Székely gulyás&quot;, named after the Hungarian writer, journalist and archivist József Székely (1825–1895).

===&quot;Paprikás krumpli&quot;===
&quot;Paprikás krumpli&quot; is a traditional paprika-based potato stew with diced potatoes, onion, ground paprika, and some bacon or sliced spicy sausage, like the smoked Debrecener, in lieu of beef.

In German-speaking countries, this inexpensive peasant stew is made with sausage and known as &quot;Kartoffelgulasch&quot; (&quot;potato goulash&quot;). Bell pepper is sometimes added.

==Outside Hungary==
Thick stews similar to &quot;pörkölt&quot; and the original cattlemen stew are popular throughout almost all the former Austrian-Hungarian Empire, from Northeast Italy to the Carpathians. Like &quot;pörkölt,&quot; these stews are generally served with boiled or mashed potato, polenta, dumplings (e.g. &quot;nokedli&quot;, or &quot;galuska&quot;), spätzle or, alternatively, as a stand-alone dish with bread. Romani people have their own version of goulash.

===Albania===
Goulash (Albanian: gullash) is considered a traditional dish among some Northern Albanians.

===Austria===

In Vienna, the former center of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a special kind of goulash has developed. The &quot;Wiener Saftgulasch&quot; or the &quot;Fiakergulasch&quot; (Fiacre being a horse-drawn cab) on the menu in traditional restaurants is a rich &quot;pörkölt&quot;-like stew; more onions but no tomatoes or other vegetables are used, and it usually comes just with dark bread. A variation of the &quot;Wiener Saftgulasch&quot; is the &quot;Fiakergulasch&quot;, which is served with fried egg, fried sausage, pickles, and dumplings named &quot;Semmelknödel&quot;.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, goulash () is a very popular and traditional dish. Introduced during the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it has become a staple with the Bosnian variant consisting of a thicker consistency, with emphasis on slow-cooked onions and meat. It is typically served with bread, mashed potatoes, or polenta, and regional variations may include veal, carrots, or beans.

===Croatia===
Goulash () is also very popular in most parts of Croatia, especially north (Hrvatsko Zagorje) and Lika. In Gorski Kotar and Lika, venison or wild boar frequently replace beef (&quot;lovački gulaš&quot;). There is also a kind of goulash with porcini mushrooms (&quot;gulaš od vrganja&quot;). Bacon is an important ingredient.

Gulaš is often served with fuži, njoki, polenta or pasta. It is augmented with vegetables. Green and red bell peppers and carrots are most commonly used. Sometimes one or more other kinds of meat are added, e.g., pork loin, bacon, or mutton.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, goulash (Czech and Slovak: &quot;guláš&quot;) is usually made with beef, although pork varieties exist, and served with boiled or steamed bread dumplings (goulash with beef in Czech &quot;hovězí guláš s knedlíkem&quot;, in Slovak &quot;hovädzí guláš s knedľou&quot;), in Slovakia more typically with bread. In pubs it is often garnished with slices of fresh onion, and is typically accompanied by beer. Beer can be also added to the stew in the process of cooking. Seasonal varieties of goulash include venison or wild boar goulashes. Another popular variant of &quot;guláš&quot; is &quot;segedínský guláš&quot; (&quot;Székelygulyás&quot;), with sauerkraut.

In Czech and Slovak slang, the word &quot;guláš&quot; means &quot;mishmash&quot;, typically used as &quot;mít v tom guláš&quot;: to be disoriented or to lack understanding of something.

===Ethiopia===
Fish goulash (; &quot;asa gulaš&quot;) is a popular dish in Ethiopia, particularly during the numerous fasting seasons as required by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. It is usually prepared with a spicy sauce having a tomato and onion base and served with injera or rice.

===Germany===

German &quot;Gulasch&quot; is either a beef (&quot;Rindergulasch&quot;), pork (&quot;Schweinegulasch&quot;), venison (&quot;Hirschgulasch&quot;), or wild boar (&quot;Wildschweingulasch&quot;) stew that may include red wine and is usually served with potatoes (in the north), white rice or spirelli noodles (mostly in canteens), and dumplings (in the south). &quot;Gulaschsuppe&quot; (goulash soup) is the same concept served as a soup, usually with pieces of white bread.
===Italy===
Goulash in Italy is eaten in the autonomous regions of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, that once had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is eaten as a regular Sunday dish. It can also, although less typically so, be found in the nearby Veneto. An interesting regional recipe comes from the Pustertal (Val Pusteria, Puster Valley) in South Tyrol. It is made of beef and red wine, and seasoned with rosemary, red paprika, bay leaf, marjoram and lemon zest, served with crusty white bread or polenta. Goulash is also quite popular in the city of Ancona, which is culturally quite near to eastern Europe.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, goulash is usually prepared with beef. It is typically consumed as a stew, and is thus closer to pörkölt.

===Poland===

In Poland, goulash () is eaten in most parts of the country. A variant dish exists that is similar to Hungarian pörkölt. It came to being around the 9th century. It is usually served with mashed potatoes or various forms of noodles and dumplings, such as pyzy.

===Serbia===
In Serbia, goulash () is eaten in most parts of the country, especially in Vojvodina, where it was probably introduced by the province&#x27;s Hungarian population. It is actually a pörkölt-like stew, usually made with beef, veal or pork, but also with game meat like venison and boar. Compulsory ingredients are meat and onions, usually in 50-50% ratio, paprika, and lard or oil, other ingredients being optional: garlic, parsley, chili pepper, black pepper, cinnamon, bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, red wine, mushrooms, bacon. Sometimes, goulash is sweetened by adding tomato paste, sugar or dark chocolate at the very end. In Serbia, goulash is most often served with macaroni or potato mash.

===Slovenia===
In Slovene &quot;partizanski golaž&quot;, &quot;partisan goulash&quot;, favored by Slovenian partisans during the Second World War, is still regularly served at mass public events. &quot;Partisan &quot;golaž&quot;&quot; uses onion in equal proportion to meat; two or more types of meat are usually used in preparing this dish. The most widespread form of golaž in home cooking is a thick beef stew that is most commonly served with mashed potatoes. As elsewhere in the wider region, Szeged goulash, usually referred to as &quot;segedin&quot;, is also a popular dish for home preparation.

===United States and Canada===

North American goulash, mentioned in cookbooks since at least 1914, exists in a number of variant recipes. Originally a dish of seasoned beef, core ingredients of American goulash now usually include elbow macaroni, cubed steak or ground beef, and tomatoes in some form, whether canned whole, as tomato sauce, tomato soup, and/or tomato paste. As a descendant, of sorts, of Hungarian goulash, it probably originated as a variation of the Hungarian which mixes all the ingredients together in the end. This mixture of ingredients has probably led to many variations where any mixture of meat and paprika is often called goulash. In English, the word “goulash” has an alternative meaning of &quot;a mixture of heterogeneous elements or hodgepodge or jumble&quot;.

<text>In user interface design, a modal window is a graphical control element subordinate to an application&#x27;s main window.

A modal window creates a mode that disables user interaction with the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users &quot;must&quot; interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent window. This avoids interrupting the workflow on the main window. Modal windows are sometimes called heavy windows or modal dialogs because they often display a dialog box.

User interfaces typically use modal windows to command user awareness and to display emergency states, though interaction designers argue they are ineffective for that use. Modal windows are prone to mode errors.

On the Web, they often show images in detail, such as those implemented by Lightbox library, or are used for hover ads.

The opposite of modal is [[modeless]]. Modeless windows don&#x27;t block the main window, so the user can switch their focus between them, treating them as palette windows.

==Relevance and use==

===Use cases===

Frequent uses of modal windows include:
* Drawing attention to vital pieces of information. This use has been criticized as ineffective because users are bombarded with too many dialog boxes, and habituate to simply clicking &quot;Close&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot;, or &quot;OK&quot; without reading or understanding the message.
* Blocking the application flow until information required to continue is entered, as for example a password in a login process. Another example are file dialogs to open and save files in an application.
* Collecting application configuration options in a centralized dialog. In such cases, typically the changes are applied upon closing the dialog, and access to the application is disabled while the edits are being made.
* Warning that the effects of the current action are not reversible. This is a frequent interaction pattern for modal dialogs, but some usability experts criticize it as ineffective for its intended use (protection against errors in destructive actions) due to habituation. They recommend making the action reversible (providing an &quot;undo&quot; option) instead.

===Modal sheets in Mac OS X===

Many features that would typically be represented by modal windows are implemented as modal transient panels called &quot;Sheets&quot; on Mac OS X. Transient windows behave similarly to modal windowsthey are always on top of the parent window and are not shown in the window list, but they do not disable the use of other windows in the application. Sheets slide out of the window&#x27;s title bar, and usually must be dismissed before the user can continue to work in the window, but the rest of the application stays usable. Thus they create a mode inside the window that contains them, but are modeless with respect to the rest of the application.

==Control of interaction flow==
Modal windows are common in GUI toolkits for guiding user workflow. Alan Cooper contends that the importance of requiring the user to attend to important issues justifies restricting the user&#x27;s freedom and that the alternative would increase user frustration.

=== Unexpected interruptions ===

Unexpected alert dialogs are particular culprits of mode errors with potentially severe consequences. Usability practitioners prescribe that dangerous actions should be undoable wherever possible; an alert box that appears unexpectedly or is dismissed by habituation doesn&#x27;t protect from the dangerous action. A modeless infobar is increasingly seen as preferable to a dialog box because it does not interrupt the user&#x27;s activities, but rather allows the user to read extra information in their own time.

One proposed approach is to design every input element as a self-contained, task-oriented interaction, guided by its own specific requirements rather than by the global state of the entire application. For example, required elements might be preceded with an asterisk, elements with invalid data might acquire a red border, and so on. With this approach, users actually benefit from seeing many input elements at once — they can enter data in a way that makes sense to them, instead of having all the other unrelated elements blocked until a predefined data-entry sequence is completed.

=== Problems ===
A modal window blocks all other workflows in the top-level program until the modal window is closed, as opposed to modeless dialogs that allow users to operate with other windows. Modal windows are intended to grab the user&#x27;s full attention. Users may not recognize that a modal window requires their attention, leading to confusion about the main window being non-responsive, or causing loss of the user&#x27;s data input intended for the main window (see Mode error). In severe cases, the modal window appears behind another window controlled by the same program, potentially rendering the entire program unresponsive until the modal window can be located manually.

However, many interface designers have recently taken steps to make modal windows more obvious by darkening the background behind the window or allowing any mouse click outside of the modal window to force the modal window to close – a design called a Lightbox – thus alleviating those problems. Jakob Nielsen states as an advantage of modal dialogs that it improves user awareness: &quot;When something does need fixing, it&#x27;s better to make sure that the user knows about it.&quot; For this goal, the Lightbox design provides strong visual contrast of the dialog over the rest of the visuals. The Lightbox technique is now a common tool in website design.

Modal windows are commonly implemented in ways that block the possibility to move, minimize, iconify, or push that window back, and they grab input focus, which often prevents use of a system&#x27;s cut, copy, and paste facilities. This can interfere with the use of their parent applications by blocking access to other windows and data within the same application, particularly in cases where the modal window is requiring the user to input information only available in one of the windows it&#x27;s covering.

For users using virtual work areas larger than their actual screens, modal windows can cause further undesirable behavior, including creating the modal on a portion of the virtual screen not currently on the display, or abruptly switching the display from what the user was working on to an entirely different section.

Modal windows tend to create an abrupt diversion of text input, especially typed input intended for other programs, into themselves. Further, modals usually interpret actuation of the enter key (or in rare cases the presence of a newline in pasted input) as a cue to accept the input and process it—or, in rare cases, may intercept a mouse click intended for a different application that has suddenly been covered. Such interception, called focus stealing (or stealing focus) can compromise privacy and security practices, as well as capture inappropriate, out-of-context input that can cause undefined, arbitrary results in the program that generated the modal window.

Depending on the specifics of implementation, modal windows can violate the principle of least surprise.

=== Recommendations ===
Modal dialogs are part of a task flow, and recommendations are given to place them where the focus is in that flow. For example, the window could be placed near the graphical control element that triggers its activation.

Using a semi-transparent dark background can obscure information in the main window, so it is best used only when that information would be distracting. A semi-transparent background can be made less intrusive by having the whole background area function as a close button: this is standard on most mobile operating systems, avoids making the user feel trapped, and makes modal windows feel less like malicious pop-ups.

Design should follow common practices in the platform the program is running on. Microsoft Windows uses standard controls for modal window dialogs, with affirmative action buttons at the lower right of the panel. Mac OS X uses modal sheets with affirmative action buttons being the right-most command.

<text>Gustav Metzger (10 April 1926, Nuremberg – 1 March 2017, London) was a stateless artist and political activist who developed the concept of Auto-Destructive Art and the Art Strike. 
Together with John Sharkey, he initiated the Destruction in Art Symposium in 1966. 
Metzger was recognised for his protests in the political and artistic realms.

==Early life and education==

Metzger was born to Polish Jewish parents in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1926 and came to Britain in 1939 as a refugee under the auspices of the Refugee Children Movement. He lost his Polish citizenship and was stateless since the late 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Performing Archives/Archives of Performance&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He received a grant from the UK Jewish community to study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp between 1948 and 1949. It is with an experience of twentieth century society&#x27;s destructive capabilities that led Metzger to a concentrated &#x27;formulation of what destruction is and what it might be in relation to art.&#x27;

Metzger became a vegetarian in 1944 and remained a strong advocate of vegetarianism throughout his life. He was among the first to take a stand against environmental pollution and nuclear proliferation.

==Career==
His experience of twentieth century society&#x27;s destructive capabilities led Metzger to a concentrated &#x27;formulation of what destruction is and what it might be in relation to art.&#x27; He was known as a leading exponent of the Auto-Destructive Art and the Art Strike movements. He was also active in the Committee of 100 - a &#x27;named&#x27; member

In 1959, Metzger published the first auto-destructive manifesto &quot;Auto-Destructive Art&quot;. This was given as a lecture to the Architectural Association School of Architecture (AA) in 1964, which was taken over by students as an artistic &#x27;Happening&#x27;. The Architectural Association published, in 2015, a facsimile edition of Metzger&#x27;s lecture transcript. In 1962 he participated in the Festival of Misfits organised by members of the Fluxus group, at Gallery One, London. Guitarist Pete Townshend from The Who studied with Metzger, and during the 1960s, Metzger&#x27;s work was projected on screens at The Who concerts. Metzger also worked with Cream, providing them with light shows in the 1960s.

In 2005, he selected EASTinternational which he proclaimed to be &quot;The art exhibition without the art.&quot;

Throughout the 60 years that Metzger produced politically engaged works, he incorporated materials ranging from trash to old newspapers, liquid crystals to industrial materials, and even acid.&quot;

From 29 September to 8 November 2009, the Serpentine Gallery featured the most extensive exhibition in the UK of his work. Exhibits included the installation &quot;Flailing Trees&quot;, 15 upturned willow trees embedded in a block of concrete, symbolising a world turned upside down by global warming. He felt that artists are especially threatened, because so many rely on nature as a big inspiration. Metzger stated that &quot;artists have a special part to play in opposing extinction, if only on a theoretical, intellectual basis.&quot;

Metzger was a non-smoker and teetotaller who did not drink coffee or English tea. He carried around his own supply of green tea and was described as a vegan in his later years. He lived and worked in East London.

==Works==

===Public Demonstration of Auto-Destructive Art===
This was originally made in 1960 and remade as &quot;Recreation of First Public Demonstration of Auto-Destructive Art&quot; in 2004.

===Demonstration at the South Bank, London, 1961===

===Acid action painting===
===Construction with glass===
===Liquid Crystal Environment===
&quot;Liquid Crystal Environment&quot; was originally made in 1965 and remade in 2005.

===Historic Photographs===
This ongoing series of work consists of enlarged press photographs of catastrophic events of the 20th century presented to the viewer using confrontational and experiential methods.

===Recreation of First Public Demonstration of Auto-Destructive Art===
This was a recreation of the original demonstration made in 1960.
An integral piece of the installation at the Tate Britain, a bag containing rubbish, was erroneously disposed by a cleaner on 30 June 2004. Metzger declared the piece ruined and created a new bag as a replacement.

===Flailing Trees===
Originally conceived for Manchester Peace Garden and commissioned by Manchester International Festival in 2009, this work consists of uprooted trees inverted into a concrete block in a powerful environmental memorandum of man&#x27;s destructive capabilities and violation of Nature.

==Influences==
The painter David Bomberg, the leading light of the Borough Group, taught Metzger and was influential in his development. Metzger was also influenced by the artwork of Johannes Vermeer and the naturopathy of Edmond Szekely.

==Death==
Metzger died at the age of 90 at his home in London on 1 March 2017. He is buried on the east side of Highgate Cemetery.

==Legacy==
When Metzger was lecturing at Ealing Art College, one of his students was rock musician Pete Townshend, who later cited Metzger&#x27;s concepts as an influence for his famous guitar-smashing during performances of The Who. He has also influenced the self-eating computer virus works by the digital artist Joseph Nechvatal.

<doc id="235680" wikidata="Q2536239" url="?curid=235680" title="Jenny Calendar">
<text>Jenny Calendar is a fictional character in the fantasy television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). Played by Robia LaMorte, Jenny is the computer teacher at Sunnydale High School. Unbeknownst to Buffy or anyone else, Jenny has been sent to Sunnydale to keep an eye on Angel.

In the first two seasons of the series, Jenny Calendar is Rupert Giles&#x27; primary romantic interest. She serves to counter his technophobia and is a rare adult female role model for the young women in Buffy&#x27;s circle. During the second season her true identity is revealed: she is Janna of the Kalderash, a member of the Romani group that cursed Angel. In response to an elder&#x27;s visions that Angel is suffering less due to his growing romance with Buffy, Jenny is instructed to impede their relationship. As a result of events during the second season storyline (specifically in Season 2, Episode 14, &quot;Innocence&quot;) Angel loses his soul and reverts to Angelus, his evil alter ego, eventually making Jenny his victim. Among the main cast, she is the series&#x27; first recurring character to die, and the manner of her death is noted for its disturbing effect on audiences.

==Creation and casting==

&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; was first created by Joss Whedon as a feature film in 1992. Unhappy with the film, Whedon later revived for television the concept of an adolescent girl who is given superhuman powers by mystical forces to defeat evil. The film only touches on the adult world surrounding Buffy Summers, while the series explores it in greater depth.

Originally trained as a dancer who toured and appeared in music videos with Prince, Robia LaMorte won the part of Jenny Calendar. LaMorte had appeared in contemporary television series such as &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, but remarked specifically that she knew at once the material given to her to read in the audition for &quot;Buffy&quot; was different: &quot;Sometimes you get scripts, and you just know. The words just fit in your mouth a different way when you know you&#x27;re supposed to speak them. And I kind of knew I was going to get it.&quot; Anthony Head, who plays Giles on the series, had already been cast and was scheduled to read with LaMorte so the casting department could gauge their chemistry—which Head acknowledged, later saying, &quot;She&#x27;s gorgeous, like a David Bailey picture.&quot; LaMorte spent a few minutes before the audition speaking and joking with Head, assuming he was a producer. When it came time for them to enter the audition room together, she handed him the chewing gum from her mouth only to learn that he was the actor cast to play opposite her.

==Progression==

===Season 1===

Jenny Calendar&#x27;s first appearance is in the episode &quot;I Robot, You Jane&quot;, which deals with the risks of online romance. Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), one of Buffy&#x27;s friends, is spending time online with someone she knows as Malcolm, who turns out to be a demon named Moloch the Corrupter. The series regularly employs monsters and elements of dark fantasy to represent real-life problems. As a Watcher, Giles is extremely knowledgeable about the creatures that Buffy must face. He has a large collection of books detailing the demon realms, upon which he relies as the main tool of research and problem-solving. Jenny challenges his traditional approach and helps him to solve the problem of how to find and kill the demon when Giles reveals himself to be a technophobe; she both frustrates and flirts with him in the process. Jenny&#x27;s character was not intended to be recurring, but the chemistry exhibited between LaMorte and Head encouraged the writers to make her a regular member of the cast.

Jenny&#x27;s role as a recurring character was cemented in &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot;, where she acknowledges that she is aware of the many evil forces in Sunnydale and indicates she is willing to join the Scoobies in their fight against them. Jenny frequently helps through her access to, and knowledge of, technology; she and the related role of Willow represent the marriage of science and magic on the series. Jenny refers to herself as a techno-pagan, not a witch. She says she does not have the necessary power to be a witch, but is adept at researching demons and other occult topics to assist Giles and Buffy. Jenny introduces viewers to the series&#x27; expression of magic. In contrast to the more clichéd portrayals of magic in the media as an evil force akin to Satan-worshiping tinged with sexploitation, magic in &quot;Buffy&quot; instead represents a more earth-bound force that can be harnessed for a physical price. Jenny tells Giles that email and bone-casting are equally valid forms of receiving information. The combination of technology and magic represent the joining of masculine and feminine fields, which Jenny Calendar embodies.

Furthermore, many of Jenny&#x27;s qualities demonstrate a closer kinship with the adolescent characters than the adult ones. In the first season, the female adolescents—Buffy, Willow, and Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter)—establish their identities in contrast to older women, usually parents or teachers. Jenny&#x27;s youthful style and her rejection of a staid way of life indicate that she is a role model for the young female characters. They do not see her as an adversarial adult.

===Season 2===

The conflicts in the second season broaden to explore the difficulties faced by Buffy as she becomes torn between love and duty—a theme which is also reflected in Jenny&#x27;s storyline. Jenny and Giles begin dating in the episode &quot;Some Assembly Required&quot;, and his attempts to ask her out force him into facing issues far more frightening than the monsters and demons with which he is familiar, and bring her into direct conflict with her secret reason for being in Sunnydale. Their romance is at the center of &quot;The Dark Age&quot;, where it is revealed that Giles&#x27; past includes a youthful exploration into dark magic, when he was known to his friends as &quot;Ripper&quot;. The result of this experimentation 20 years ago calls a demon named &quot;Eyghon&quot; to Sunnydale; the demon temporarily possesses Jenny, prompting her to halt their relationship. At the end of the episode, she tells Giles she needs some time away from him. Although the make-up requirement for LaMorte&#x27;s appearance as Eyghon nearly gave her an anxiety attack, she considered this the most fun episode she filmed. She was called upon to throw Giles across the room and slam his head onto a table.

Jenny and Giles tentatively reignite their relationship in &quot;Ted&quot;. According to Lorna Jowett, Jenny Calendar—and later, Olivia (Phina Oruche)—serves to assure viewers that Giles, despite being a bookish man who spends most of his time with adolescents, is heterosexual and has no sexual interest in the teenage characters. His relationship with Jenny also allows them to emphasize the generation gap between themselves and adults: they consider the idea of him as a sexual being &quot;gross&quot;.

Author Tracy Little asserts that in addition to the theme of love vs. duty, &quot;you are not who I thought you were&quot; applies to the second season, and notably, centers around Jenny Calendar. In &quot;Surprise&quot; it is revealed that Jenny is an emissary from the tribe that cursed Angel. Her true name is Janna (pronounced Yannah), and she has been sent to ensure he continues to suffer for his past brutality. Janna&#x27;s Uncle Enyos (Vincent Schiavelli) comes to remind her of her duty to her people and he expresses his disappointment that, as a woman from a group of people wary of technology and intermarriage with outsiders, she has become a computer teacher in a relationship with a non-Gypsy. Angel&#x27;s ongoing torment allows the curse to continue working and must be maintained. An &quot;Elder Woman,&quot; however, has had visions that Angel&#x27;s pain is lessening and that this cannot be allowed to happen—Jenny must separate him from Buffy, as she is the cause of his relief. Enyos does not tell her a significant element of the curse: should Angel ever experience even one moment of true happiness, his soul will again disappear, making him &quot;Angelus&quot;, the evil vampire he was. This factor comes into play when Buffy and Angel have sex in &quot;Innocence&quot; as in the intimacy of that experience he feels happiness deep enough to trigger the loss of his soul. Angelus becomes the second season&#x27;s Big Bad and begins to terrorize Buffy and her inner circle by stalking and threatening them. Buffy subsequently figures out that Jenny is involved in Angel&#x27;s transformation and confronts her. This revelation causes a deep rift between Jenny and the rest of the Scoobies and effectively halts her romance with Giles. Buffy demands that she curse Angel again, but Jenny does not know how to do this. Angelus&#x27; first act is to kill Enyos, thus revealing that Angel already knew Jenny&#x27;s true identity and motives prior to losing his soul at some point. For most of the rest of the second season Jenny remains estranged from Buffy&#x27;s circle; only Willow, who Jenny asks to teach her computer class for her, regularly interacts with her.

====Death====
By the episode &quot;Passion&quot; it has become clear that Angelus is targeting Buffy&#x27;s friends and family and has, in Giles&#x27; words, &quot;regained his sense of whimsy&quot;, demonstrated by petty cruelties that keep the group unsettled and frightened. In their first real conversation since estrangement, Giles warns Jenny to beware of the increasing danger to them all; during this conversation she admits to Giles that she has fallen in love with him and they agree to meet later. Despite the improbability of success and without telling Giles or Buffy, Jenny attempts to restore Angel&#x27;s soul by using her computer to translate the ancient curse. Upon learning what she is doing, Angelus destroys the computer, taunts Jenny, then laughs as he chases her through the school, finally killing her by snapping her neck. He then takes Jenny&#x27;s body to Giles&#x27; apartment and sets up music, champagne, and roses, as if she is awaiting him in his bedroom for a romantic encounter; Giles then finds her dead body arranged on his bed. To derive the maximum pleasure from what he has done, Angelus waits outside Buffy&#x27;s house to watch their shock and distress as Buffy and Willow receive the call that Jenny has been murdered.

Steve Vineberg, a film and theater professor, asserts in a 2000 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the character&#x27;s death marked &quot;the most terrifying and upsetting phase of the show&quot;. Similarly, author Kathleen Tracy states that &quot;Passion&quot; is, among the first two seasons&#x27; episodes, the most &quot;viscerally disturbing&quot; not only for Jenny&#x27;s death and its brutality, but because the series killed off a regularly recurring and sympathetic character, something which was unprecedented in television history. Joss Whedon recognized this when he stated in an interview that killing Jenny, and the manner of her dispatching, was precisely devised to make several points. It was integral that the show make clear to the audience that &quot;not everything is safe, that not every &quot;one&quot; is safe...to show that death is final and death is scary&quot;, and to signal that any character, at any time, could die. Jenny&#x27;s death was also used to make clear that Angel, in his incarnation as Angelus, is truly evil and now Buffy&#x27;s mortal enemy whom she must kill. After much discussion, Whedon and the writers decided that Angel should not bite Jenny, but instead break her neck as a show of his contempt for her: &quot;I&#x27;m not even going to feed&quot; is the attitude Whedon wanted to communicate, as well as Angel&#x27;s evident pleasure in the act. Whedon also felt that it was important that Angel do so wearing his vampire face as they planned to bring the re-ensouled Angel back later, and it would be &quot;too disturbing&quot; to the audience to accept Buffy ever kissing him again had the murder been committed while in his normal visage. Whedon stated that the writing team wanted the prospect of bringing Angel back after the murder of Jenny Calendar to be very difficult and so fraught with consequences that even the characters would not be sure they wanted him to return.

==Influence==

Following her death, Jenny Calendar&#x27;s character continues to have an influence on the series. Among the female Scoobies, it is Willow who most looks up to Jenny. Willow is skilled with computers and her mother is emotionally distant from her; Willow expresses several times that her parents are mostly uninterested in her. As Jenny offers both mentoring and validation for Willow, she becomes a substitute mother for her. Jenny furthermore argues that traditionally, knowledge has been kept from people as a result of systemized patriarchy, and she champions computers and the Internet because she believes they will create a new society. Author J. P. Williams asserts that Jenny Calendar&#x27;s feminist viewpoints resonate with Willow, as Willow receives similar commentary about patriarchy in the media on the rare occasions her mother speaks to her. Jenny is limited, however, by the very patriarchy she fights. Her first lessons from her people are about vengeance, and she is fully committed to her duty to watch Angel. Although she treats Giles as an equal and demands the same from him, her deference to her uncle stifles her. Enyos&#x27; withholding information from Jenny is echoed in Giles&#x27; frequent ignorance of facts the Watcher&#x27;s Council deliberately withholds from him. Because Jenny is not told the full details of the curse, she is unable to warn Buffy and Angel, thus her ignorance essentially kills her. Williams writes, &quot;Whether &quot;Buffy&quot; will eventually provide an alternative model of womanhood is perhaps the series&#x27; most intriguing cliffhanger.&quot;

In an analysis of the treatment of Romani people in literature and media, Nikolina Dobreva asserts that the show deserves to be criticized for associating Gypsies with curses and primitivism, for stereotyping Gypsies as &quot;irrevocably foreign&quot; in clothing and speech, and for perpetuating the persistent air of mystery surrounding them. Dobreva, however, praises the character of Jenny Calendar, writing in 2009: &quot;Jenny’s character, despite the reversion to a few stereotypes, is arguably one of the most multi-faceted and positive representations of a female Gypsy in the past 20 years. In sharp contrast to all other Gypsy portrayals, she is technologically savvy, and, instead of resorting to incantations or obscure rituals, is able to create a computer algorithm that would make possible the restoration of Angel’s soul.&quot;

In the episode &quot;Becoming&quot;, Willow finds the spell that Jenny translated and casts it herself, successfully restoring Angel&#x27;s soul and leading to her own foray into magic. Willow attempts to learn more about magic in the fourth season by joining her college Wicca group, only to be met by women who are ineffectual, whom she labels &quot;wanna-blessed-bes&quot;. She takes magic very seriously, becoming competent enough in the fifth season to achieve what Buffy cannot. By the seventh season, Willow&#x27;s magical gifts are so powerful that she is the strongest person in Buffy&#x27;s circle. Additionally, Jenny&#x27;s comfort in expressing sexuality is a model for all the young women. Her &quot;sexual (or sensual) aggression&quot; is noted by Buffy studies writers. Williams asserts that Jenny&#x27;s influence on Willow is evident when, in the fourth season, Willow falls in love with another woman, Tara Maclay (Amber Benson), expressing little self-doubt when she realizes she has.

Jenny appears twice more in the series, first in &quot;Becoming&quot;, as part of an illusion the vampire Drusilla (Juliet Landau) creates to beguile Giles into telling Angelus, who is torturing him, what he needs to know. She again appears in the third-season episode &quot;Amends&quot; as the guise of the First Evil, who assumes the faces of many people Angel has killed, tormenting him and insisting he kill Buffy.

<doc id="235683" wikidata="Q1226555" url="?curid=235683" title="Dinkytown">
<text>Dinkytown is a commercial district within the Marcy-Holmes neighborhood in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Centered at 14th Avenue Southeast and 4th Street Southeast, the district contains several city blocks occupied by various small businesses, restaurants, bars, and apartment buildings that house mostly University of Minnesota students. Dinkytown is along the North side of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities East Bank campus.

== Notable landmarks ==
Notable landmarks include the Dinkydome (a former theological seminary converted to a food court, which sometime later was converted into loft space), the Loring Pasta Bar (formerly Gray&#x27;s Campus Drug and also the building where Bob Dylan lived in Minneapolis), Al&#x27;s Breakfast (arguably the city&#x27;s smallest restaurant), and the Varsity Theater. It&#x27;s also the location of the second store opened by Richard M. Schulze called &quot;Sound of Music&quot;, which later became Best Buy and is now closed.

== Notable establishments ==
The former Marshall-University High School on the corner of 14th Avenue and 5th Street was closed in 1982 due to changing city population demographics and was purchased and converted into the University Technology Enterprise Center (UTEC) for startups. The building was razed in 2013, and today the location is home to The Marshall, an apartment building for University students. The Chateau co-op built their brutalist-style 22-story apartment in 1973 at 13th Avenue Southeast and 5th Street Southeast. 

==History==

The City of Minneapolis&#x27; Heritage Preservation designated a portion of the area as the Dinkytown Commercial Historic District in 2015, due to its significance in the history of streetcar development. The historic district covers an area roughly two blocks around, surrounding the intersection of 14th Avenue Southeast and 4th Street Southeast.

The name Dinkytown is of uncertain origin, although it was in definite use by 1948, when the Dinkytown Business Association formed.
Stories regarding the origin of the name include:
* The streetcars, called &quot;Dinkys&quot;, that used to provide transit throughout the area.
* The theatre in Dinkytown had only four rows of seats, and for years was known as &quot;The Dinky Theater.&quot; Shortly thereafter, it was just &quot;The Dinky.&quot;
* It&#x27;s a small (dinky) town-like area; everything is within walking distance.
* The Loring Pasta Bar, previously Gray&#x27;s Drug on 14th Avenue Southeast and 4th Street Southeast, has the name of an early owner carved in cement over the doorway: &quot;Grodnik.&quot; Theories claim this means a small (or dinky) town, under the claim that &quot;Grod&quot; means &quot;town&quot; and &quot;-nik&quot; is the diminutive form. Another possible translation (from Polish and Belarusian) is &quot;gardener&quot;; &quot;grod&quot; meaning &quot;garden&quot;, and&quot;-nik&quot; as a person-reference, giving &quot;one who gardens&quot;.
