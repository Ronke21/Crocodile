<text>A positronic brain is a fictional technological device, originally conceived by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. It functions as a central processing unit (CPU) for robots, and, in some unspecified way, provides them with a form of consciousness recognizable to humans. When Asimov wrote his first robot stories in 1939 and 1940, the positron was a newly discovered particle, and so the buzz word &quot;positronic&quot; added a scientific connotation to the concept. Asimov&#x27;s 1942 short story &quot;Runaround&quot; elaborates his fictional Three Laws of Robotics, which are ingrained in the positronic brains of nearly all of his robots.

==Conceptual overview==
Asimov remained vague about the technical details of positronic brains except to assert that their substructure was formed from an alloy of platinum and iridium. They were said to be vulnerable to radiation and apparently involve a type of volatile memory (since robots in storage required a power source keeping their brains &quot;alive&quot;). The focus of Asimov&#x27;s stories was directed more toward the software of robots—such as the Three Laws of Robotics—than the hardware in which it was implemented, although it is stated in his stories that to create a positronic brain without the Three Laws, it would have been necessary to spend years redesigning the fundamental approach toward the brain itself.

Within his stories of robotics on Earth and their development by U.S. Robots, Asimov&#x27;s positronic brain is less of a plot device and more of a technological item worthy of study.

A positronic brain cannot ordinarily be built without incorporating the Three Laws; any modification thereof would drastically modify robot behavior. Behavioral dilemmas resulting from conflicting potentials set by inexperienced and/or malicious users of the robot for the Three Laws make up the bulk of Asimov&#x27;s stories concerning robots. They are resolved by applying the science of logic and psychology together with mathematics, the supreme solution finder being Dr. Susan Calvin, Chief Robopsychologist of U.S. Robots.

The Three Laws are also a in brain sophistication. Very complex brains designed to handle world economy interpret the First Law in an expanded sense to include humanity as opposed to a single human; in Asimov&#x27;s later works like &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; this is referred to as the &quot;Zeroth Law&quot;. At least one brain constructed as a calculating machine, as opposed to being a robot control circuit, was designed to have a flexible, childlike personality so that it was able to pursue difficult problems without the Three Laws inhibiting it completely. Specialized brains created for overseeing world economics were stated to have no personality at all.

Under specific conditions, the Three Laws can be obviated, with the modification of the actual robotic design.
* Robots that are of low enough value can have the Third Law deleted; they do not have to protect themselves from harm, and the brain size can be reduced by half.
* Robots that do not require orders from a human being may have the Second Law deleted, and therefore require smaller brains again, providing they do not require the Third Law.
* Robots that are disposable, cannot receive orders from a human being and are not able to harm a human, will not require even the First Law. The sophistication of positronic circuitry renders a brain so small that it could comfortably fit within the skull of an insect.

Robots of the last type directly parallel contemporary industrial robotics practice, though real-life robots do contain safety sensors and systems (a weak form of the First Law; the robot is a safe tool to use, but has no &quot;judgment&quot;, which is implicit in Asimov&#x27;s own stories).

<text>In topology, a clopen set (a portmanteau of closed-open set) in a topological space is a set which is both open and closed. That this is possible may seem counterintuitive, as the common meanings of and are antonyms, but their mathematical definitions are not mutually exclusive. A set is closed if its complement is open, which leaves the possibility of an open set whose complement is also open, making both sets both open closed, and therefore clopen. As described by topologist James Munkres, unlike a door, &quot;a set can be open, or closed, or both, or neither!&quot; emphasizing that the meaning of &quot;open&quot;/&quot;closed&quot; for is unrelated to their meaning for (and so the open/closed door dichotomy does not transfer to open/closed sets). This contrast to doors gave the class of topological spaces known as &quot;door spaces&quot; their name. 

== Examples ==

In any topological space formula_1 the empty set and the whole space formula_2 are both clopen.

Now consider the space formula_2 which consists of the union of the two open intervals formula_4 and formula_5 of formula_6 The topology on formula_2 is inherited as the subspace topology from the ordinary topology on the real line formula_6 In formula_1 the set formula_4 is clopen, as is the set formula_11 This is a quite typical example: whenever a space is made up of a finite number of disjoint connected components in this way, the components will be clopen.

Now let formula_2 be an infinite set under the discrete metricthat is, two points formula_13 have distance 1 if they&#x27;re not the same point, and 0 otherwise. Under the resulting metric space, any singleton set is open; hence any set, being the union of single points, is open. Since any set is open, the complement of any set is open too, and therefore any set is closed. So, all sets in this metric space are clopen.

As a less trivial example, consider the space formula_14 of all rational numbers with their ordinary topology, and the set formula_15 of all positive rational numbers whose square is bigger than 2. Using the fact that formula_16 is not in formula_17 one can show quite easily that formula_15 is a clopen subset of formula_19 (formula_15 is a clopen subset of the real line formula_21; it is neither open nor closed in formula_6)

== Properties ==

* A topological space formula_2 is connected if and only if the only clopen sets are the empty set and formula_2 itself.
* A set is clopen if and only if its boundary is empty.
* Any clopen set is a union of (possibly infinitely many) connected components.
* If all connected components of formula_2 are open (for instance, if formula_2 has only finitely many components, or if formula_2 is locally connected), then a set is clopen in formula_2 if and only if it is a union of connected components.
* A topological space formula_2 is discrete if and only if all of its subsets are clopen.
* Using the union and intersection as operations, the clopen subsets of a given topological space formula_2 form a Boolean algebra. Boolean algebra can be obtained in this way from a suitable topological space: see Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras.

<text>A siege engine is a device that is designed to break or circumvent heavy castle doors, thick city walls and other fortifications in siege warfare. Some are immobile, constructed in place to attack enemy fortifications from a distance, while others have wheels to enable advancing up to the enemy fortification. There are many distinct types, such as siege towers that allow foot soldiers to scale walls and attack the defenders, battering rams that damage walls or gates, and large ranged weapons (such as ballistas, catapults/trebuchets and other similar constructions) that attack from a distance by launching heavy projectiles. Some complex siege engines were combinations of these types.

Siege engines are fairly large constructions – from the size of a small house to a large building. From antiquity up to the development of gunpowder, they were made largely of wood, using rope or leather to help bind them, possibly with a few pieces of metal at key stress points. They could launch simple projectiles using natural materials to build up force by tension, torsion, or, in the case of trebuchets, human power or counterweights coupled with mechanical advantage. With the development of gunpowder and improved metallurgy, bombards and later heavy artillery became the primary siege engines.

Collectively, siege engines or artillery together with the necessary soldiers, sappers, ammunition, and transport vehicles to conduct a siege are referred to as a siege train.

==Antiquity==

===Ancient Assyria through the Roman Empire===

The earliest siege engines appear to be simple movable roofed towers used for cover to advance to the defenders&#x27; walls in conjunction with scaling ladders, depicted during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. Advanced siege engines including battering rams were used by Assyrians, followed by the catapult in ancient Greece. 
In Kush siege towers as well as battering rams were built from the 8th century BC and employed in Kushite siege warfare, such as the siege of Ashmunein in 715 BC.
The Spartans used battering rams in the siege of Plataea in 429 BC, but it seems that the Greeks limited their use of siege engines to assault ladders, though Peloponnesian forces used something resembling flamethrowers.

The first Mediterranean people to use advanced siege machinery were the Carthaginians, who used siege towers and battering rams against the Greek colonies of Sicily. These engines influenced the ruler of Syracuse, Dionysius I, who developed a catapult in 399 BC.

The first two rulers to make use of siege engines to a large extent were Philip II of Macedonia and Alexander the Great. Their large engines spurred an evolution that led to impressive machines, like the Demetrius Poliorcetes&#x27; &quot;Helepolis&quot; (or &quot;Taker of Cities&quot;) of 304 BC: nine stories high and plated with iron, it stood tall and wide, weighing . The most used engines were simple battering rams, or &quot;tortoises&quot;, propelled in several ingenious ways that allowed the attackers to reach the walls or ditches with a certain degree of safety. For sea sieges or battles, seesaw-like machines (&quot;sambykē&quot; or &quot;sambuca&quot;) were used. These were giant ladders, hinged and mounted on a base mechanism and used for transferring marines onto the sea walls of coastal towns. They were normally mounted on two or more ships tied together and some sambuca included shields at the top to protect the climbers from arrows. Other hinged engines were used to catch enemy equipment or even opposing soldiers with opposable appendices which are probably ancestors to the Roman corvus. Other weapons dropped heavy weights on opposing soldiers.
The Romans preferred to assault enemy walls by building earthen ramps (&quot;agger&quot;) or simply scaling the walls, as in the early siege of the Samnite city of Silvium (306 BC). Soldiers working at the ramps were protected by shelters called &quot;vineae&quot;, that were arranged to form a long corridor. Convex wicker shields were used to form a screen (&quot;&quot; or plute in English) to protect the front of the corridor during construction of the ramp. Another Roman siege engine sometimes used resembled the Greek ditch-filling tortoise of Diades, this galley (unlike the ram-tortoise of Hegetor the Byzantium) called a &quot;musculus&quot; (&quot;muscle&quot;) was simply used as cover for sappers to engineer an offensive ditch or earthworks. Battering rams were also widespread. The Roman Legions first used siege towers ; in the first century BC, Julius Caesar accomplished a siege at Uxellodunum in Gaul using a ten-story siege tower. Romans were nearly always successful in besieging a city or fort, due to their persistence, the strength of their forces, their tactics, and their siege engines.

The first documented occurrence of ancient siege engine pieces in Europe was the &quot;gastraphetes&quot; (&quot;belly-bow&quot;), a kind of large crossbow. These were mounted on wooden frames. Greater machines forced the introduction of pulley system for loading the projectiles, which had extended to include stones also. Later torsion siege engines appeared, based on sinew springs. The onager was the main Roman invention in the field.
===Ancient China===
The earliest documented occurrence of ancient siege-artillery pieces in China was the levered principled traction catapult and an high siege crossbow from the Mozi (Mo Jing), a Mohist text written at about the 4th – 3rd century BC by followers of Mozi who founded the Mohist school of thought during the late Spring and Autumn period and the early Warring States period. Much of what we now know of the siege technology of the time comes from Books 14 and 15 (Chapters 52 to 71) on Siege Warfare from the Mo Jing. Recorded and preserved on bamboo strips, much of the text is now extremely corrupted. However, despite the heavy fragmentation, Mohist diligence and attention to details which set Mo Jing apart from other works ensured that the highly descriptive details of the workings of mechanical devices like Cloud Ladders, Rotating Arcuballistas and Levered Catapults, records of siege techniques and usage of siege weaponry can still be found today.

===Elephant===
Indian, Sri Lankan, Chinese and Southeast Asian kingdoms and empires used war elephants as battering rams.

==Middle Ages==
Medieval designs include a large number of catapults such as the mangonel, onager, the ballista, the traction trebuchet (first designed in China in the 3rd century BC and brought over to Europe in the 4th century AD), and the counterweight trebuchet (first described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi in the 12th century, though of unknown origin). These machines used mechanical energy to fling large projectiles to batter down stone walls. Also used were the battering ram and the siege tower, a wooden tower on wheels that allowed attackers to climb up and over castle walls, while protected somewhat from enemy arrows.

A typical military confrontation in medieval times was for one side to lay siege to an opponent&#x27;s castle. When properly defended, they had the choice whether to assault the castle directly or to starve the people out by blocking food deliveries, or to employ war machines specifically designed to destroy or circumvent castle defenses. Defending soldiers also used trebuchets and catapults as a defensive advantage.

Other tactics included setting fires against castle walls in an effort to decompose the cement that held together the individual stones so they could be readily knocked over. Another indirect means was the practice of mining, whereby tunnels were dug under the walls to weaken the foundations and destroy them. A third tactic was the catapulting of diseased animals or human corpses over the walls in order to promote disease which would force the defenders to surrender, an early form of biological warfare.

==Modern era==

With the advent of gunpowder, firearms such as the arquebus and cannon—eventually the petard, mortar and artillery—were developed. These weapons proved so effective that fortifications, such as city walls, had to be low and thick, as exemplified by the designs of Vauban.

The development of specialized siege artillery, as distinct from field artillery, culminated during World War I and World War II. During the First World War, huge siege guns such as Big Bertha were designed to see use against the modern fortresses of the day. The apex of siege artillery was reached with the German Schwerer Gustav gun, a huge caliber railway gun, built during early World War II. Schwerer Gustav was initially intended to be used for breaching the French Maginot Line of fortifications, but was not finished in time and (as a sign of the times) the Maginot Line was circumvented by rapid mechanized forces instead of breached in a head-on assault. The long time it took to deploy and move the modern siege guns made them vulnerable to air attack and it also made them unsuited to the rapid troop movements of modern warfare.

<text>Foreign policy, also known as external policy, is the set of strategies and actions a state employs in its interactions with other states, unions, and international entities. It encompasses a wide range of objectives, including defense and security, economic benefits, and humanitarian assistance. The formulation of foreign policy is influenced by various factors such as domestic considerations, the behavior of other states, and geopolitical strategies. Historically, the practice of foreign policy has evolved from managing short-term crises to addressing long-term international relations, with diplomatic corps playing a crucial role in its development.

The objectives of foreign policy are diverse and interconnected, contributing to a comprehensive approach for each state. Defense and security are often primary goals, with states forming military alliances and employing soft power to combat threats. Economic interests, including trade agreements and foreign aid, are central to a country&#x27;s role in the global economy. Additionally, many states have developed humanitarian programs based on the responsibility to protect, supporting less powerful countries through various forms of assistance. The study of foreign policy examines the reasons and methods behind state interactions, with think tanks and academic institutions providing research and analysis to inform policy decisions.

== History ==

The idea of long-term management of relationships followed the development of professional diplomatic corps that managed diplomacy.

In the 18th century, due to extreme turbulence in European diplomacy and ongoing conflicts, the practice of diplomacy was often fragmented by the necessity to deal with isolated issues, termed &quot;affairs&quot;. Therefore, while domestic management of such issues was termed civil affairs (peasant riots, treasury shortfalls, and court intrigues), the term foreign affairs was applied to the management of temporary issues outside the sovereign realm. This term remained in widespread use in the English-speaking states into the 20th century, and remains the name of departments in several states that manage foreign relations. Although originally intended to describe short term management of a specific concern, these departments now manage all day-to-day and long-term international relations among states.

Think tanks are occasionally employed by government foreign relations organizations to provide research and advocacy in the development of foreign policy proposals, alternatives to existing policy, or to provide analytical assessments of evolving relationships.

== Objectives ==
Several objectives may motivate a government&#x27;s foreign policy. Foreign policy may be directed for defense and security, for economic benefit, or to provide assistance to states that need it. All foreign policy objectives are interconnected and contribute to a single, comprehensive foreign policy for each state. Unlike domestic policy, foreign policy issues often arise suddenly in response to developments and major events in foreign countries.

=== Defense ===
Foreign policy is often directed for the purpose of ensuring national security. Governments forming military alliances with foreign states in order to deter and show stronger resistance to attack. Foreign policy also focuses on combating adversarial states through soft power, international isolation, or war.

In the 21st century, defensive foreign policy has expanded to address the threat of global terrorism.

=== Economic ===
Foreign policy is central for a country&#x27;s role within the world economy and international trade. Economic foreign policy issues may include the establishment of trade agreements, the distribution of foreign aid, and the management of imports and exports.

=== Internationalist ===
Many states have developed humanitarian programs under the concept of the responsibility to protect. Proponents of liberal internationalism believe that it is the duty of stronger and more well-off countries to assist and support less powerful countries. This idea is often associated with the idealist school of thought. Liberal internationalist support can take the form of defensive or economic support.

== Influences ==

=== Power and National capabilities ===
Superpowers are able to project power and exercise their influence across the world, while great powers and middle powers have moderate influence in global affairs.

Small powers have less ability to exercise influence unilaterally, as they have fewer economic and military resources to leverage. As a result, they are more likely to support international and multilateral organizations. The diplomatic bureaucracies of smaller states are also smaller, which limits their capacity to engage in complex diplomacy. Smaller states may seek to ally themselves with larger countries for economic and defensive benefits, or they may avoid involvement in international disputes so as to remain on friendly terms with all countries.

=== Form of government ===
The political institutions and forms of government play a role in a country&#x27;s foreign policy. In a democracy, public opinion and the methods of political representation both affect a country&#x27;s foreign policy. Democratic countries are also believed to be less likely to resort to military conflict with one another. Autocratic states are less likely to use legalism in their foreign policies. Under a dictatorship, a state&#x27;s foreign policy may depend heavily on the preferences of the dictator. Dictators that interfere significantly with their foreign policy apparatus may be less predictable and more likely to make foreign policy blunders.

== Study ==

The study of foreign policy considers why and how states interact with one another and maintain relations. Several schools of thought exist in the study of foreign policy, including the rational actor model based on rational choice theory, the government bargaining model that posits the foreign policy apparatus as several competing interests, and the organizational process model that posits the foreign policy apparatus as interlinked bureaucracies that each play their own role.

Think tanks exist that study foreign policy specifically, including the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States and the Chatham House in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="233408" wikidata="Q6561633" url="?curid=233408" title="Glossary of American terms not widely used in the United Kingdom">
<text>This is a list of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom. In Canada and Australia, some of the American terms listed are widespread; however, in some cases, another usage is preferred.

* Words with specific American meanings that have different meanings in British English and/or additional meanings common to both dialects (e.g., &quot;pants&quot;, &quot;crib&quot;) are to be found at List of words having different meanings in British and American English. When such words are herein used or referenced, they are marked with the flag [DM] (different meaning).
* Asterisks (*) denote words and meanings having appreciable (that is, not occasional) currency in British English, but nonetheless distinctive of American English for their relatively greater frequency in American speech and writing. Americanisms are increasingly common in British English, and many that were not widely used some decades ago, are now so (e.g., &quot;regular&quot; in the sense of &quot;regular coffee&quot;).
* American spelling is consistently used throughout this article, except when explicitly referencing British terms.

<text>Ama-gi is a Sumerian word written &quot;ama-gi4&quot; or &quot;&quot;. Sumerians used it to refer to release from obligations, debt, slavery, taxation, or punishment. Ama-gi has been regarded as the first known written reference to the concept of freedom, and has been used in modern times as a symbol for libertarianism. 

== Sumerian use ==

Ama-gi has been translated as &quot;freedom&quot;, as well as &quot;manumission&quot;, &quot;exemption from debts or obligations&quot;, and &quot;the restoration of persons and property to their original status&quot; including the remission of debts. Other interpretations include a &quot;reversion to a previous state&quot; and release from debt, slavery, taxation or punishment.

The word originates from the noun &quot;ama&quot; &quot;mother&quot; (sometimes with the enclitic dative case marker &quot;ar&quot;), and the present participle &quot;gi4&quot; &quot;return, restore, put back&quot;, thus literally meaning &quot;returning to mother&quot;. Assyriologist Samuel Noah Kramer has identified it as the first known written reference to the concept of freedom. Referring to its literal meaning &quot;return to the mother&quot;, he wrote in 1963 that &quot;we still do not know why this figure of speech came to be used for &#x27;freedom&#x27;.&quot;

The earliest known usage of the word was in the decree of Enmetena restoring &quot;the child to his mother and the mother to her child.&quot; By the Third Dynasty of Ur, it was used as a legal term for the manumission of individuals.

In some cuneiform texts, it is translated by the Akkadian word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;exemption&quot; and &quot;release from (debt) slavery&quot;.

== Modern libertarian use ==

A number of libertarian organizations have adopted the cuneiform glyph as a symbol claiming it is &quot;the earliest-known written appearance of the word &#x27;freedom&#x27; or &#x27;liberty.&#x27;&quot; It is used as a logo by the &quot;Instituto Político para la Libertad&quot; of Peru, the &quot;New Economic School – Georgia&quot;, Libertarian publishing firm Liberty Fund, and was the name and logo of the journal of the London School of Economics&#x27; &quot;Hayek Society&quot;. British musician Frank Turner and Alberta premier Danielle Smith have the symbol tattooed on their forearms.

<text>The Communards () were members and supporters of the short-lived 1871 Paris Commune formed in the wake of the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. After the suppression of the Commune by the French Army in May 1871, 43,000 Communards were taken prisoner, and 6,500 to 7,500 fled abroad. The number of Communard soldiers killed in combat or executed afterwards during the week has long been disputed—Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray put the number at 20,000, while estimates by more recent historians put the probable number between 10,000 and 15,000. 7,500 were jailed or deported under arrangements which continued until a general amnesty during the 1880s; this action by Adolphe Thiers forestalled the proto-communist movement in the French Third Republic (1871–1940).

== Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune ==

The working class of Paris were feeling ostracized after the decadence of the Second Empire and the Franco-Prussian War. The Prussians besieged Paris in September 1870, causing suffering among Parisians. The poor ate cat or rat meat or went hungry. Out of resentment from this situation grew radical and socialist political clubs and newspapers. While Paris was occupied, socialist groups tried twice to overthrow the provisional government.

In January 1871, Otto von Bismarck and the French minister of foreign affairs, Jules Favre, decided that France would hold national elections. Adolphe Thiers, who had been loyal to the Second Empire, was elected head of the new republic. During the war, the capital had moved from Paris to Bordeaux. When the war ended, the government moved temporarily to Versailles. In the early morning of March 18, the government stationed in Versailles sent military forces into Paris to collect a reserve of cannons. The detachment was gathering the guns when units of the Paris national guard surrounded them, and killed two French army generals. By the end of the day, the insurgent soldiers of the national guard controlled the city. They declared a new government called the Paris Commune, which lasted from March 18 to May 28, 1871.

Thiers refused to bargain with the Communards, despite their attempts to do so. He taught newly released French soldiers the &quot;evils&quot; of the Communards as the government prepared for a battle. The Commune responded by building barricades in the Paris streets. Starting on May 21 and continuing through May 28, the French army entered Paris and gradually recaptured the city. Around eighteen thousand communards were killed in combat, more were executed afterwards. The violence of The &quot;Bloody Week&quot; became a rallying cry for the working classes; some politicians would later proudly brag about their participation with the Commune.

== Deportation ==
After Bloody Week, the government asked for an inquest into the causes of the uprising. The inquest concluded that the main cause of the insurrection was a lack of belief in God, and that this problem had to be corrected immediately. It was decided that a moral revival was needed, and a key part of this was deporting 4,500 Communards to New Caledonia. There was a two-part goal in this, as the government also hoped that the Communards would &quot;civilize&quot; the native Kanak people on the island. The government hoped that being exposed to the order of nature would return the Communards to the side of &quot;good.&quot;

New Caledonia had become a French colony in 1853, but just ten years later it still only had 350 European colonists. After 1863, New Caledonia became the principal destination of convicts transported from France after French Guiana was deemed too unhealthy for people of European descent. Thereafter, convicts from France made up the largest number of arriving residents. During the busiest time of deportation, there were estimated to be about 50,000 total people on the island. This included 30,000 Kanak, 2,750 civilian colonists, 3,030 military personnel, 4,000 &quot;déportés&quot; (political criminals, including the Communards), 6,000 (common-law criminal convicts), and 1,280 criminal convicts who had served their sentences but were still living on the island. There were four main penitentiary sites on the island, one of which, Isle of Pines (1870–1880), was for the Communards deportees exclusively.

== Sentences ==
There were three sentences given out to the : simple deportation, deportation to a fortified place, and deportation with forced labor. A simple deportation sentence was given to about two-thirds of the Communards. These people were sent to live in small villages on the Isle of Pines. Those sentenced to deportation to a fortified place were sent to the Ducos peninsula. About 300 Communards were sentenced to deportation with forced labor; these were the people convicted of crimes such as arson in addition to their political crimes. They were sent to be with the criminal convicts on the main island (&#x27;Grande Terre&#x27;). Some prisoners’ sentences were changed by the local penal administrators, and some were changed by the French government after petitions for leniency.

== Life in New Caledonia ==
The government did not give out enough food, clothing, or shelter for all of the . Some were assigned housing in rickety structures, but others had to find their own materials to build huts. Construction tools could be bought from the administration. Hunting for food became part of the daily routine. Some even traded their clothing for food with the Kanak. Not every part of life on the island was bad, however. Those living on the Isle of Pines and Ducos peninsula had freedom of movement, allowing them to live where they wanted and swim and fish at their leisure. They lived in simple wood huts that formed small, face-to-face communities that were intended to be self-governing.

Those sentenced to forced labor often endured abuse at the hands of their jailers. They were habitually mistreated while imprisoned, with whippings and the use of thumbscrews as common punishments for minor infractions. The National Assembly passed legislation that gave the wives and children of freedom to go to New Caledonia. It also gave wives a much greater right to property than they had in France, giving them half the property rights over any grant given to their husbands. Through this legislation, 174 families making up 601 people were reunited by 1877.

== Escape ==
The relatively &#x27;laid back&#x27; period of deportation ended when six déportés successfully escaped from the Ducos peninsula in 1874. François Jourde was the main planner of the escape, which he developed while living in the port town of Nouméa. He had developed connections with a ship&#x27;s captain, John Law, who was paid for his participation. The escapees, who included Jourde, Henri Rochefort, Paschal Grousset, Olivier Pain, Achille Ballière, and Bastien Grandhille, boarded the boat under the cover of darkness and hid in the ship&#x27;s hold until they cleared the harbor. Law dropped them off in Sydney, Australia, where crowds gathered to see them. Reports of their escape and the strict conditions they had lived under were printed in newspapers in Australia, the United States, and Europe. While the escapees attempted to publicize the plight of those still on the island, the déportés who remained had to deal with the repercussions of the escape. New rules forbade the prisoners from approaching the sea without permission, subjected them to daily roll calls, and banned them from entering the forests, even to collect firewood.

== Relationships with the Kanak ==

There are clearly documented examples of friendships between the Communards and the Kanak. Achille Ballière and his friends visited the Kanak in their homes, shared meals with them, and played with their children. In the first few years of the deportation there were at least two marriages between the Kanak and Communards. However, the separation of the groups enforced after the 1874 escapes prevented any more such relationships from forming. During the eight-month-long Kanak insurrection in 1878, the Communards displayed a solidarity with their effort in the local press. This solidarity did not last long, however, as beliefs of racial differences soon took over.

Louise Michel looked to the Kanak youth for guidance and inspiration, and offered them moral support when they joined the 1878 insurrection. She ran a school for the Kanak and encouraged a local theater to perform a Kanak drama. She fully expected the achievements of the Kanak to match those of the French, though she wrote about them in very paternalistic terms that were common for her time period.

== Famous Communards ==
Henri Rochefort gave a series of lectures that were published in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; while staying in the United States after his escape from New Caledonia. They were highly critical of the French government for denying its citizens liberty. His 1884 novel helped shape the legend of the deportation. It offered a portrayal of the deportation and the policies of the government in New Caledonia that was different from what the governmental propaganda was promoting.

George Pilotell (1845–1918) was the son of a Judge but pursued art and moved to Paris in 1862. As a prolific political caricaturist he was frequently imprisoned and became an active member of the commune in which he appointed himself &#x27;Directeur des Beaux Arts&#x27; but later properly appointed a &#x27;commissaire special&#x27;. In 1874 he escaped a death sentence by fleeing to London. While he was well known for his caricatures in France, he gained a reputation in England as a fashion designer, society portrait painter and theatre costume designer. He has work in the National Portrait Gallery, the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Adrien Lejeune was famously the last surviving communard when he died at 94 years&#x27; old in the Soviet Union in 1942.

== Amnesty ==
By the summer of 1878, the concern of amnesty for the Communards had become a significant political issue for France. In January 1879, the prime minister Jules Armand Dufaure granted mass pardons for the Communards in an attempt to stop the calls for amnesty. The pardons excused the convictions of the Communards. This was a problem for many people who had never actually been convicted but only indicted. On January 16, the government published a list of whose sentences were pardoned. These people were allowed to return to France; however, more than one thousand Communards were not included in this list. Men who had been convicted of crimes other than political, or whose political opinions were considered too dangerous, were left behind.

After the announcement of the pardons, many people in France were hoping for a stronger declaration of total amnesty. Petitions were passed around in all Paris neighborhoods to try and influence the government. A bill calling for total amnesty was introduced into the Chamber of Deputies by Louis Blanc and into the senate by Victor Hugo. The legislation that was eventually pushed through ensured full civil rights to those not convicted of crimes beyond political, and officially ended the prosecution of Communards in military courts. In July 1880, parliament finally voted for total amnesty.

Nine ships brought the back to France. The first arrived in August 1879 and the last arrived in July 1880. Large crowds greeted the ships with celebrations. Donations of money were collected for the Communards and festivals were held to raise money. A committee of aid, headed by Louis Blanc and Victor Hugo, planned a dinner at which they dispersed a small amount of money to all who attended. Offers of employment were made, overcoats were given out, and temporary housing was offered.

== Aftermath ==
Some Communards chose never to come back to France after having built successful lives in New Caledonia or adopting other countries, such as Australia, as home. Many Communards who did come back returned to public life, such as Louise Michel; however, many found the adjustment to freedom difficult. Meetings between Communards and their former jailers occurred in the streets, at times leading to minor skirmishes. In December 1879, an investigative committee was formed to look into charges of torture in New Caledonia. The inquiry lasted two years, collecting the results of previous government studies, more than forty depositions, and testimonials to parliament by the Communards. The Communards&#x27; memories of abuse then became public record, which helped to heal the relations between the former prisoners and the state. The Soviet Union named many places as Kommunarka, such as Kommunarka, where Kommunarka shooting ground was located.

<text>Michael Ciaran Parker (born 4 May 1952), known by his stage name Michael Barrymore, is an English comedian, influencer and television presenter of game shows and light entertainment programmes on British television in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. These included &quot;Strike It Lucky&quot;, &quot;My Kind of People&quot;, &quot;My Kind of Music,&quot; &quot;Kids Say the Funniest Things&quot;, and his own variety show, &quot;Barrymore&quot;. In 1993, he headlined the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;.

At his peak, Barrymore was voted the UK&#x27;s favourite television star several times, and he became one of the highest-paid stars on television from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. Barrymore subsequently appeared on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; and other shows including &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot;, &quot;Graham Norton&#x27;s Bigger Picture&quot;, &quot;This Morning&quot;, &quot;The Sharon Osbourne Show&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot;. He starred in &quot;Bob Martin&quot; from 2000 to 2001, a comedy drama in which he played the title role of a failing television game-show host.

Barrymore&#x27;s television career effectively ended after the death of Stuart Lubbock in 2001 following a party at Barrymore&#x27;s house in Essex. Barrymore was the subject of police investigations and legal action around the case over several years.

==Early life==
Born Michael Ciaran Parker in Bermondsey, on Sunday, 4 May 1952, he lived on the Dickens estate for the first 18 years of his life with his two elder siblings. His father left when Barrymore was 11 and they never saw each other again. Barrymore and his siblings were raised in the Roman Catholic faith of their Irish mother, Margaret.

==Career==

===Early career===
Barrymore spent his early career working as a Redcoat at Butlins holiday camps and then in the West End theatre shows of London, where he met dancer Cheryl Cocklin in 1974. They married in 1976. With Cheryl as manager and the mastermind behind Barrymore&#x27;s rise to fame, he first won a 1975 edition of &quot;New Faces&quot;, became a regular panellist on &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; and then the warm-up man for Larry Grayson on the &quot;Generation Game&quot; and also for Little and Large theatre shows. In the early days, Barrymore used to do impressions of John Cleese and Norman Wisdom, among others.

===Television career (1976–2002)===
Barrymore rose to fame via appearances on &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Do?&quot; and his television career began firstly by having his own sketch show entitled &quot;The Michael Barrymore Show&quot; in 1983, which starred a young Nicholas Lyndhurst, and he also appeared in &quot;Russ Abbot&#x27;s Madhouse&quot; as various characters in 1981 and 1982. He walked out of his contract with LWT, who produced &quot;The Michael Barrymore Show&quot;, after only one series; he then landed the presenter&#x27;s role on the BBC game show &quot;Get Set, Go!&quot;. He appeared in a number of &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; shows, his first being in 1983. He became the host of ITV gameshow &quot;Strike It Lucky&quot; (which later became &quot;Strike It Rich&quot;) in 1986 and it grew in popularity over the years, watched by 18 million viewers at its peak.

This was Barrymore&#x27;s first successful presenting role (&quot;Get Set Go!&quot; had been cancelled after only one single series), which led then to his own light entertainment show, &quot;Barrymore&quot; in 1991. However, before that he had his own show between 1988 and 1989, produced for the BBC entitled &quot;Michael Barrymore&#x27;s Saturday Night Out&quot;; it was set in Jersey and the theme tune, &quot;Doin&#x27; the Crab&quot; had been released as a single in 1987.

In 1991, Barrymore was given his own show entitled &quot;Barrymore&quot; where he interviewed guests, performed his comedy routines and joined in with other performers on the show. The show lasted throughout the 1990s right up to 2000, and was consistently nominated for awards over the years in the UK. Among the many famous guests that appeared on &quot;Barrymore&quot; were Cliff Richard, Uri Geller, and Spike Milligan.

Following his appearance on the 1993 &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;, where he performed a version of &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow&quot; with soldiers, he became popular on television and on the stage. The Royal Variety Show performance brought the house down and cemented Barrymore&#x27;s place at the heart of the British public. Barrymore became well known through his catchphrases of &quot;Awight!&quot;, on making his entrance, and on &quot;Strike It Lucky&quot;, &quot;Top, middle or bottom?&quot; and &quot;What is a hot spot not?&quot;, to which the studio audience would reply &quot;a good spot&quot;.
Following on from the success, Barrymore had a very public battle with substance abuse. He went into rehab due to his alcohol and drug addiction in 1994. He left after a couple of months and went on to write a best-selling book about his experiences, including rehab, and he also went on a stage tour called &quot;Back in Business&quot; in 1994.

He then regained his former status and made another series of &quot;Barrymore&quot; and recorded a new series called &quot;My Kind of People&quot;. He came out as gay on 19 August 1995 and split from his wife in 1996. He made a new series of &quot;Strike It Lucky&quot;, now called &quot;Strike It Rich&quot; and another &quot;Barrymore&quot; series. More editions of &quot;Strike It Rich&quot; and &quot;Barrymore&quot; were shown in 1997 and he also appeared in &quot;Spice World&quot; as Mr. Step.

A spin-off talent show, &quot;My Kind of People&quot; and game show &quot;My Kind of Music&quot; followed the success of both &quot;Barrymore&quot; and &quot;Strike It Rich&quot;. Following a dip in ratings, &quot;Barrymore&quot; was cancelled in 1997 (it later returned in 2000). He went on to new projects with &quot;Kids Say the Funniest Things&quot;, &quot;Animals Do the Funniest Things&quot; and &quot;Barrymore on Broadway&quot;. He was voted the UK&#x27;s favourite TV star several times, and became one of the highest-paid stars on TV. Barrymore won the National Television Award for Most Popular Entertainment Presenter five out of the first six years, last at the 6th NTAs in 2000. This makes him the last winner of that award before Ant and Dec, who since the 7th NTAs in 2001 have been named Most Popular Entertainment Presenter (or, since 2016, Most Popular TV Presenter) every year the awards were held, 19 in all as of January 2020.

He recorded two new series called &quot;My Kind of Music&quot; and &quot;Kids Say the Funniest Things&quot; in 1998 along with more &quot;Strike It Rich&quot;. Newer editions of all three series were shown and another series of &quot;Barrymore&quot; was recorded and shown in 2000. The year 2000 also saw Barrymore move into acting in &quot;Bob Martin&quot; where he played the character of Bob Martin; he recorded two series of the comedy (2000–01). Barrymore also presented a second series of &quot;Kids Say the Funniest Things&quot; which aired in late 2000 and also a fourth series of &quot;My Kind of Music&quot; which was on the air at the time that Stuart Lubbock died in Barrymore&#x27;s pool on 31 March 2001. Following Lubbock&#x27;s death, both &quot;Bob Martin&quot; and &quot;My Kind of Music&quot; stayed on the air while the investigation was ongoing, but he did not record any further programmes for ITV. They constantly backed him when asked by the newspapers and simply waited for investigations to conclude. In October 2001, Barrymore was given a drugs caution and began recording a new series of &quot;My Kind of Music&quot;.

==Death of Stuart Lubbock==
===Party===
Following a party at Barrymore&#x27;s house in Essex in the early hours of 31 March 2001, a 31-year-old man, Stuart Lubbock, was discovered unconscious in Barrymore&#x27;s swimming pool. Three witnesses – including Barrymore – claimed to have found him motionless in the pool. Witnesses disagreed on whether Lubbock was found floating on top of the pool or at the bottom. Barrymore had said he was on top of the pool. Lubbock, described as a &quot;bubbly partygoer&quot;, had traces of drugs and alcohol in his system. In the postmortem, pathologists discovered severe anal injuries, which several experts, including senior Home Office pathologist Nathaniel Cary, later agreed were consistent with a sexual assault.

Many tabloid newspapers accused Barrymore of holding drug-fuelled orgies in his home and asserted he had some responsibility for the death. Kylie Merritt, a partygoer, had claimed that Barrymore had been seen at the party rubbing cocaine onto Lubbock&#x27;s gums, an allegation Barrymore denied.

===Arrest and inquest===
Barrymore received a police caution for possession and use of cannabis. Barrymore and two other people at the party, Justin Merritt and Jonathan Kenney, were arrested on suspicion of murder on 6 June 2001. No other charges were laid against him or anyone else in connection with the death. The inquest that took place in September 2002 reached an open verdict. In light of the verdict, Cheryl Barrymore was approached by a friend of the Lubbock family. She provided the family&#x27;s solicitor with both an affidavit and subsequent court testimony that her ex-husband had lied under oath, and could in fact swim; she also alleged he had rubbed cocaine onto the gums of other people as well as his own.

In November 2002, Barrymore&#x27;s lawyers successfully demanded that Essex Police re-investigate matters surrounding Lubbock&#x27;s death. Their focus was on Barrymore&#x27;s allegations that the injuries inflicted upon Lubbock&#x27;s body could have occurred while it was lying unguarded in the mortuary. A pathologist&#x27;s report found that Lubbock&#x27;s wounds were only four hours old at the time of the examination at 4 pm, while Lubbock had been pronounced dead at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow at 8.20 am that morning. Barrymore told BBC Radio 5 Live: &quot;We want to prove the fact that the anal injuries could not have happened at the house.&quot; He added: &quot;If these injuries had happened then, why have the police not charged anyone with anything?&quot; An investigation into these claims by Essex Police in 2003 found &quot;no evidence&quot; to support them, instead concluding there was &quot;strong evidence&quot; the injuries were sustained before the arrival of paramedics.

===Private prosecution===
On Barrymore&#x27;s high-profile return to the UK in January 2006 to take part in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, former solicitor, politician and local activist Anthony Bennett initiated a private prosecution, comprising six charges regarding Barrymore&#x27;s alleged misuse of drugs on the night of Stuart Lubbock&#x27;s death. The action commenced in Epping Magistrates&#x27; Court in January 2006 and, on 10 February 2006, a District Judge at Southend Magistrates&#x27; Court blocked the private prosecution against Barrymore on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Bennett was no longer a solicitor and was acting independently of Terry Lubbock, Stuart&#x27;s father.

===Reopened investigation===
In an interview with Piers Morgan in the December 2006 edition of &quot;GQ&quot;, Barrymore stated there were other witnesses to the events who were hiding information. On 2 December 2006, police announced they would reopen the investigation into Lubbock&#x27;s death after receiving a lengthy dossier submitted by Bennett, now Terry Lubbock&#x27;s solicitor. The dossier described a series of alleged failures by Essex Police in the original investigation, and claimed an elaborate coverup of the true circumstances of Lubbock&#x27;s death had taken place.

===Complaints processes===
On 22 December 2006, following a successful complaint to the Press Complaints Commission by Bennett, &quot;The Sun&quot; published a letter from Terry Lubbock replying to the newspaper&#x27;s five-page feature on Barrymore earlier in the year which featured Terry&#x27;s meeting with Barrymore.

On 1 March 2007, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), following a complaint lodged the previous December by Terry Lubbock, announced an investigation into aspects of the police inquiry into Lubbock&#x27;s death after receiving complaints from the Lubbock family. It was reported that complaints surrounded information Essex Police gave to a coroner and pathologist after Lubbock&#x27;s death. In May the IPCC agreed with Terry Lubbock a schedule of 36 separate complaints relating to the original investigation into Lubbock&#x27;s death.

===Further arrests===
On 14 June 2007, Essex Police arrested Barrymore and two other men on suspicion of murder and sexual assault in the Lubbock case. The two other men arrested were Jonathan Kenney, Barrymore&#x27;s partner at the time of the death, and Justin Merritt, an unemployed former dustman at the time, all present at the party when Lubbock died. The three men were held for questioning at South Woodham Ferrers police station.

This followed reports in &quot;The Harlow Herald&quot; that police had seized tapes from the home of Barrymore&#x27;s literary agent, Tony Cowell, allegedly containing conversations between Cowell and Barrymore.

On 15 June 2007, police were given permission to question Barrymore and one other man for a further 12 hours. Barrymore&#x27;s solicitor Henri Brandman confirmed his client was one of the men arrested. Later that day Barrymore was released on police bail pending further enquiries. His solicitor stated that Barrymore &quot;categorically denied&quot; the allegations made and had not been charged with any offence.

===Investigation dropped===
On 31 July 2007, it was announced that Barrymore had been re-bailed to appear at an Essex Police station on 10 September. He answered bail on 10 September at Harlow police station. Police were then granted a further 12 hours to question him. On that date, Barrymore and the other two men were told that they would not face charges for the events that occurred. The case was left open. In July 2008 Lubbock&#x27;s father published the book &quot;Not Awight: Getting Away With Murder&quot;, co-authored with Bennett, explaining their theory that Stuart had died as a result of a violent attack on him, which Barrymore and his associates that night covered up.

===Civil action===
In July 2015, Barrymore sued Essex Police for wrongful arrest, valuing his claim for damages at more than £2.4million. Essex Police subsequently acknowledged that Barrymore had been wrongfully arrested, although this was due to administrative errors and not to a lack of evidence.

In August 2017, the High Court in London ruled that Barrymore would be entitled to &quot;more than nominal&quot; damages against Essex Police. This decision was overturned in 2019 by the Court of Appeal which ruled that he would be entitled only to &quot;nominal&quot; damages. Essex Police subsequently announced that Barrymore had dropped his compensation claim and that no payments had been made to him.

===Renewed appeal===
On 4 February 2020, Essex Police offered a £20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction. The cash reward, funded by Essex Police and the charity Crimestoppers, was in response to a new Channel 4 documentary on the incident, &quot;Barrymore: The Body in the Pool&quot;, that aired on 6 February 2020.

On 17 March 2021, nearly 20 years after Lubbock&#x27;s death, Essex Police confirmed that they had arrested a 50-year-old man from Cheshire in connection with the indecent assault and murder of Stuart Lubbock, as a result of the appeal. He was later released without charge.

==Career revivals==
Following the revelation of Lubbock&#x27;s death, ITV terminated Barrymore&#x27;s contract and his television career collapsed. A new series of &quot;Kids Say the Funniest Things&quot; recorded prior to the scandal was pulled from the ITV schedule and never broadcast. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the BBC cancelled publication of Barrymore&#x27;s life story. In September 2003, Barrymore staged a one-man show at London&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, which closed after a few days. He subsequently emigrated to New Zealand to live with his partner, Shaun Davis. He has since had live stage shows in New Zealand and Australia. In 2005, he appeared in &quot;Chicago&quot; in Napier, New Zealand.

=== &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; ===
In December 2005, it was announced that Barrymore was being paid £150,000 by Channel 4 to take part in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; commencing 5 January 2006. He had a difficult relationship with housemate George Galloway, which culminated in a 20-minute heated argument between the two men. On 27 January 2006, he finished runner-up to Chantelle Houghton.

=== After &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; ===
Remaining in the UK, Barrymore was booked to be the guest host on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot; for the edition broadcast on 3 February 2006. This is the last time that Barrymore appeared on a show as the presenter. The months following Barrymore&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Big Brother&quot; were full of speculation that Barrymore was in talks with a number of television channels over the possibility of new shows, but nothing ever came of this. Barrymore&#x27;s appearance on the &quot;Friday Night Project&quot; is the last time he presented a primetime television show.

It was announced that for Christmas 2006, Barrymore would play the title role in Bill Kenwright&#x27;s production of &quot;Scrooge – The Musical&quot;. He performed the lead role at the Empire Theatre, Sunderland, but the production&#x27;s scheduled transfer to the West End was cancelled. In January 2008, Barrymore took the role of comedian and writer Spike Milligan in the stage play &quot;Surviving Spike&quot;. It played Windsor and later the Edinburgh Fringe, but again, its West End transfer was cancelled. In February 2010, he appeared on Irish television on &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot;, where he unexpectedly performed numerous bizarre and controversial antics, including pretending to be Jedward&#x27;s father.

In May 2010, Barrymore startled his co-contestants on a reality TV show by revealing that he had fallen in love with a woman. Barrymore was filming an episode of Channel 4 show &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;, with former &quot;Generation Game&quot; host Anthea Redfern and presenters Pat Sharp and Jenny Powell, when he said he was going to have a party to celebrate that he was &quot;coming back in&quot;.

Barrymore&#x27;s personal publicity, particularly in the tabloid press, continued to be negative. In December 2011, he was convicted of cocaine possession and fined £780. His only work in 2012 was on local radio stations, and on hospital radio. One was on Minster FM, on Greg Scott&#x27;s breakfast show on 25 February 2012, where he was surprised to meet one of his all-time favourite television guests, Fiona Iverson, who had appeared on his show 20 years earlier.

In 2013, Barrymore appeared on the RTÉ programme &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot;, where he discussed his harsh treatment by the press, his addiction and also the possibility of a new show called &quot;My Kind of Twits&quot;. He subsequently claimed on Twitter that a pilot for &quot;My Kind of Twits&quot; would be filmed in May, but this did not happen. Barrymore also appeared on &quot;The Nolan Show&quot; in June 2013.

In March 2019 Barrymore appeared on &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;. In September 2019, it was announced that Barrymore would take part in the 12th series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; starting in January 2020. However, on 18 December 2019, he had to withdraw because of a broken hand and was replaced by former &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter Radzi Chinyanganya.

==Personal life==
Barrymore met Cheryl Cocklin in 1974 while she was a dancer in a West End theatre show. They married in 1976.

Cocklin became his manager and was the mastermind behind Barrymore&#x27;s rise to fame. She later said that Barrymore had problems with alcohol and depression, and as a result of his attack on her at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles, she was placed by British police on the &quot;at risk&quot; register.

At the height of his popularity, Barrymore suffered increasing alcohol problems. He claims that he wanted to seek help, but that Cocklin continually told him &quot;No, you&#x27;re not (alcoholic). Don&#x27;t be stupid.&quot;

===Sexuality===
In mid-1995, at the height of his fame, Barrymore went to The White Swan gay pub in London&#x27;s East End, where he gave an impromptu stage performance to the largely local crowd, singing the words: &quot;Start spreading the news, I&#x27;m gay today&quot;, in the style of the &quot;Theme from New York, New York&quot;. Within 48 hours, every tabloid newspaper had printed its own version of the evening&#x27;s events, including an untrue claim that Barrymore had thrown away his wedding ring.

In August 1995, Barrymore attended the National Television Awards. At an after-show party on a live late night radio show, he publicly declared he was gay and &quot;no longer wanted to live a lie&quot;, following which he broke up with Cocklin. She later claimed Barrymore took the step and did not tell her because of his talks with Diana, Princess of Wales.

===Divorce===
After several aborted reunions, Barrymore and Cocklin divorced in 1997. In 2002, she published her autobiography, &quot;Catch a Falling Star&quot;, which described their acrimonious split. They subsequently had no contact. In his 2006 autobiography &quot;Awight Now: Setting the Record Straight&quot;, Barrymore claimed that Cocklin was a &quot;control freak&quot; who determined his every move, including the clothes he wore, and that she created &quot;the character that was Michael Barrymore&quot;, consequently driving him to alcohol, drugs and gay affairs. In a 2002 interview, he said he was an alcoholic and was in recovery.

On 1 April 2005, Cocklin died of lung cancer, aged 55, at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in St John&#x27;s Wood.

<text>The Raritan River is a river of the U.S. state of New Jersey. Its watershed drains much of the mountainous areas in the northern and central sections of the state, emptying into the Raritan Bay near Staten Island on the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
Geologists assert that the lower Raritan provided the course of the mouth of the Hudson River approximately 6,000 years ago. Following the end of the last ice age, the Narrows had not yet been formed and the Hudson flowed along the Watchung Mountains to present-day Bound Brook, then followed the course of the Raritan eastward into Lower New York Bay.

The name &quot;Raritan&quot; possibly derives from a branch of the Lenape people called the Nariticongs, the first people known to settle the Raritan Valley. 

Following conflict with the arriving Dutch colonists, the native people of the region, especially the Sanhican, were forced to sell their territory near the Raritan Bay and move further inland along the river valley. As English colonists took over the region, they took advantage of the river&#x27;s location between New York and Philadelphia as well as a road network developed by the Lenape to turn the region into a transportation and commercial hub. As a result, the Raritan River became an important waterway for colonial travel and trade, allowing for the development of trade centers like Raritan Landing and New Brunswick, where agricultural and raw material goods could be sold. 

During the American Revolutionary War, the river was the site of guerilla warfare by American militiamen against British patrols, culminating in the Battle of Bound Brook where a large British force attacked an American outpost south of the river.

The success of the Erie Canal (completed in 1825) sparked a &quot;canal fever&quot; in the United States, catalyzing the construction of the Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&amp;R) between New Brunswick on the Raritan and Bordentown on the Delaware River. The D&amp;R was completed in 1834 and provided a critical link between Philadelphia (and the rest of the greater Mid-Atlantic region, at large) and New York (and the rest of the greater New England region, at large), as these cities were situated along the crucial rivers of the Delaware and the Hudson, respectively. The vast majority of traffic along the canal was Pennsylvania anthracite coal with the rest consisting mostly of agricultural and textile goods. At its peak in 1866 the D&amp;R transported more cargo than the Erie Canal. In 1932 the D&amp;R canal shut down for commercial use. In 1974 the canal was developed as a state park for recreational use and remains in use as a water supply for central New Jersey. Various mill towns were formed along the canal and the aforementioned river (and tributaries), most notably (from south to north / west to east) being Trenton, Kingston, Blackwells Mills, Griggstown, Hillsborough, Manville, Chester, Bernards, Clinton, Raritan, Milltown, and Woodbridge.

==Description==
The main Raritan River forms at the confluence of the North Branch Raritan River and the South Branch Raritan River, just west of Somerville at the border of Bridgewater, Branchburg, and Hillsborough Townships. 

The North Branch Raritan River&#x27;s headwaters are located in Mendham Borough and it flows from out of Morris County southward into Somerset County, to the southern end of the Watchung Mountains. The South Branch Raritan River&#x27;s headwaters are located at Budd Lake (a glacial remnant a few miles northeast of Hackettstown), and it flows out of Morris County, through the heart of Hunterdon County, and along the western edge of Somerset County.

After the confluence of the North and South branches, the Raritan River flows for approximately , before slowing in tidewater at New Brunswick. Its estuary extends more, entering the western end of Raritan Bay at South Amboy.

Comprehensive measures have been taken to reduce the pollution and increase the water quality. These actions have benefited the fish population which include (but are not limited to) largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, sunfish, catfish, trout, chain pickerel, american eels, carp and yellow perch. Pike can be found in relative abundance in some portions of the river like Clinton and Califon. An occasional Musky has been taken out of the Raritan as well. The tidal portions of the river host migratory salt water species such as striped bass, fluke, winter flounder, weakfish and bluefish. Recently, efforts to restore anadromous fish populations have been made, done by removing many of the obsolete dams and the constructing dam bypass infrastructure. Hopefully this will result in restoring shad, striped bass, and sturgeon populations in the river. Many songbirds, wading birds, and waterfowl make their homes in and along the length of the river, such as mallards, canadian geese, great blue herons, double-crested cormorants, and common mergansers. Common songbirds include the american robin, song sparrow, northern mockingbird, common grackle, and the Red-winged blackbird. Crustaceans such as blue claw crab, fiddler crabs and green crabs are also found in the tidal sections of the river. Crayfish can be found farther upstream.

The river is also used for recreational boating, including use by the rowing team of Rutgers University in New Brunswick. The river is featured in the title of Rutgers&#x27; alma mater, &quot;On the Banks of the Old Raritan&quot;, and its flooding is mentioned in the song. 

Near its mouth, the river is spanned by the Raritan Bay Drawbridge, a New Jersey Transit railroad bridge which carries the North Jersey Coast Line; the Victory Bridge which carries Route 35 (connecting Perth Amboy and Sayreville, New Jersey); the Edison Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 9 (connecting Woodbridge Township and Sayreville); and the Driscoll Bridge, which carries the Garden State Parkway (connecting Woodbridge Township and Sayreville).

==Water supply==
The Raritan River is an important source of drinking water for the central portion of New Jersey. A water filtration plant operated by New Jersey American Water is located in Somerset and draws its water at the confluence of the Raritan River and its largest tributary (the Millstone River), providing an average of of water per day. 

The New Jersey Water Supply Authority operates two reservoirs off of the Raritan river, the Spruce Run Reservoir and Round Valley Reservoir, and controls releases of water to ensure the “minimum passing flow rates” enforced by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Additionally, the Delaware and Raritan Canal, managed by the New Jersey Water Supply Authority, serves as a water supply that pumps over of water per day from the Delaware to the Raritan river and serves over 1 million customers along the way

==Flooding==
The Raritan River has persistent flooding problems when excessive rain from storms affects the river basin. The flooding problems mainly affect the town of Bound Brook, which is partially built on a natural floodplain at the junction of several tributaries, and Manville, which has a large neighborhood known as Lost Valley that lies on the floodplain between the Raritan River and its largest tributary river, which is known as the Millstone River. Other towns in the Raritan River basin also experience flooding to a lesser degree.

Record flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 () flood crest, above flood stage) caused renewed interest in a flood control project called the Green Brook Flood Control Project, which is designed to protect Bound Brook from a 150-year flood. In August 2011, record flooding occurred once again after Hurricane Irene swept through the area. This problem was exacerbated by well-above average rainfall that fell in the weeks before the storm hit, and spurred completion of the Army Corps of Engineers flood control project. As of 2015, the current status of this project is:
# The R2 levee system is functionally complete – The R2 Levee System is designed to provide Bound Brook with protection from a 150-year flood level. The levee is built to the height of the raised Talmage Avenue Bridge.
# Closure gates along Raritan are functionally complete – The gate closures across the New Jersey Transit railroad tracks on the western side of Bound Brook and at the South Main Street railroad underpass that leads to Queens Bridge have been completed and are used to keep flood waters out of Bound Brook.
# The new Talmadge Avenue Bridge that connects Bound Brook and Bridgewater, New Jersey is functionally complete. The replacement bridge was built to the height of the R2 Levee to prevent Middle Brook and Raritan River waters from entering Bound Brook from the west.
# To improve water flow through Bound Brook, the former Conrail bridge over the Raritan River and its associated railroad embankment that were located east of Bound Brook were removed during 2007. The bridge and embankment, when they were in place, acted to block the river flow through the Bound Brook area. To build the main Bound Brook R2 levee, the bridge and embankment needed to be removed.

<text>is a railway station on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen and the Seishin-Yamate Line serving the city of Kobe, Japan, and the surrounding area. It is located to the north of Kobe city centre, at the foot of Mount Rokkō. The Shinkansen trains mostly run inside tunnels under the mountains in this area. The station exists in a small space in between two long tunnels (Rokkō and Kobe Tunnels).

This station was newly built for the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen and is connected with the city center by the Kobe Municipal Subway.

<text>Ballard Power Systems Inc. is a developer and manufacturer of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell products for markets such as heavy-duty motive (consisting of bus and tram applications), portable power, material handling as well as engineering services. Ballard has designed and shipped over 400 MW of fuel cell products to date.

==History==
Ballard was founded in 1979 by geophysicist Geoffrey Ballard, Keith Prater, and Paul Howard, under the name Ballard Research Inc. to conduct research and development on high-energy lithium batteries. Since committing to the development of PEM fuel cell technology in 1989, Ballard has delivered PEM fuel cell products worldwide to a number of leading product manufacturers.

Ballard went public in 1993 on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), and in 1995 was listed on the NASDAQ. Ballard Power Systems opened a fuel cell manufacturing facility in 2000 in Burnaby, B.C.

==Automotive fuel cell cooperations==
On February 1, 2008, Ballard spun out Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation (AFCC) to allow for further expansion of fuel cell technology. After the split, Ballard continued as a publicly traded company focusing on non-automotive applications (including buses), while AFCC became a privately held company of 150 employees, developing hydrogen fuel cell stacks for automobiles. AFCC&#x27;s initial ownership split was Daimler AG (50.1%), Ford Motor Company (30.0%), and Ballard itself (19.9%).

In 2018, Ballard signed a contract with Weichai Power for a strategic partnership. Weichai acquired for US$163 million19.9 percent of Ballard&#x27;s shares. As part of this collaboration, Ballard and Weichai intend to supply the Chinese market with fuel cell systems for trucks, busses, and forklifts.

In cooperation with German car manufacturer Audi, Ballard is part of a development partnership for automotive fuel cells, which will run at least until 2022. Ballard delivers fuel cells to bus manufacturers, e.g. Van Hool (Belgium), New Flyer (Canada) and Solaris (Poland).

==Other activity areas==
Besides road vehicles, Ballard delivers fuel cells also for trains, mining trucks, marine applications, and backup power systems for critical infrastructures such as radio towers. Furthermore, a fuel cell system for application in drones is under development.

==Achievements==
Ballard has:
* supplied vehicles with fuel cells traveling more than 200 million kilometers in total to date 2024 
* access to 2,000 patents/applications

<doc id="233429" wikidata="Q3635544" url="?curid=233429" title="Cardiac pacemaker">
<text>The cardiac pacemaker is the heart&#x27;s natural rhythm generator. It employs pacemaker cells that produce electrical impulses, known as cardiac action potentials, which control the rate of contraction of the cardiac muscle, that is, the heart rate. In most humans, these cells are concentrated in the sinoatrial (SA) node, the primary pacemaker, which regulates the heart’s sinus rhythm.

Sometimes a secondary pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. Cardiac arrhythmias can cause heart block, in which the contractions lose their rhythm. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply &quot;pacemaker&quot;) may be used after damage to the body&#x27;s intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically.

==Control==
===Primary pacemaker===
The sinoatrial node (SA node) is the primary pacemaker of the heart. It is a region of cardiac muscle on the wall of the upper right atrium near to the superior vena cava entrance. The cells that make up the SA node are specialized cardiomyocytes known as pacemaker cells that can spontaneously generate cardiac action potentials. These signals are propagated through the heart&#x27;s electrical conduction system. Only one percent of the heart muscle cells are conductive, the rest of the cardiomyocytes are contractile.

The pacemaker cells are connected to neighboring contractile cells via gap junctions, which enable them to locally depolarize adjacent cells. Gap junctions allow the passage of positive cations from the depolarization of the pacemaker cell to adjacent contractile cells. This starts the depolarization and eventual action potential in contractile cells. Having cardiomyocytes connected via gap junctions allow all contractile cells of the heart to act in a coordinated fashion and contract as a unit. All the while being in sync with the pacemaker cells; this is the property that allows the pacemaker cells to control contraction in all other cardiomyocytes. 

Cells in the SA node spontaneously depolarize, ultimately resulting in contraction, approximately 100 times per minute. This native rate is constantly modified by the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers via the autonomic nervous system, so that the average resting heart rate in adult humans is about 70 beats per minute.

===Secondary (AV junction and Bundle of His)===
Impulses from the sinus node reach the atrioventricular node which acts as the secondary pacemaker. The cells of the AV node normally discharge at about 40–60 beats per minute, and are called the &quot;secondary pacemaker&quot;. 

Further down the electrical conducting system of the heart is the Bundle of His. The left and right bundle branches, and the Purkinje fibers, will also produce a spontaneous action potential at a rate of 30–40 beats per minute, so if the SA and AV node both fail to function, these cells can become pacemakers. These cells will be initiating action potentials and contraction at a much lower rate than the primary or secondary pacemaker cells.

The SA node controls the rate of contraction for the entire heart muscle because its cells have the quickest rate of spontaneous depolarization, thus they initiate action potentials the quickest. The action potential generated by the SA node passes down the electrical conduction system of the heart, and depolarizes the other potential pacemaker cells (AV node) to initiate action potentials before these other cells have had a chance to generate their own spontaneous action potential, thus they contract and propagate electrical impulses to the pace set by the cells of the SA node. This is the normal conduction of electrical activity in the heart.

==Generation of action potentials==
There are three main stages in the generation of an action potential in a pacemaker cell. Since the stages are analogous to contraction of cardiac muscle cells, they have the same naming system. This can lead to some confusion as phases one and two are absent, leaving only phases zero, three, and four.

===Phase 4Pacemaker potential===
The key to the rhythmic firing of pacemaker cells is that, unlike neurons, these cardiomyocytes will slowly depolarize by themselves and do not need any outside innervation from the autonomic nervous system to fire action potentials.

In all other cells, the resting potential (-60mV to -70mV) is caused by a continuous outflow or &quot;leak&quot; of potassium ions through ion channel proteins in the membrane that surrounds the cells. However, in pacemaker cells, this potassium permeability (efflux) decreases as time goes on, causing a slow depolarization. In addition, there is a slow, continuous inward flow of sodium, called the &quot;funny&quot; or pacemaker current. These two relative ion concentration changes slowly depolarize (make more positive) the inside membrane potential (voltage) of the cell, giving these cells their pacemaker potential. When the membrane potential gets depolarized to about -40mV it has reached threshold (cells enter phase 0), allowing an action potential to be generated.

=== Phase 0Upstroke ===
Though much faster than the depolarization of phase 4, the upstroke in a pacemaker cell is slow compared to that in an axon.

The SA and AV node do not have fast sodium channels like neurons, and the depolarization is mainly caused by a slow influx of calcium ions. (The funny current also increases). Calcium enters the cell via voltage-sensitive calcium channels that open when the threshold is reached. This calcium influx produces the rising phase of the action potential, which results in the reversal of membrane potential to a peak of about +10mV. It is important to note that intracellular calcium causes muscular contraction in contractile cells, and is the effector ion. In heart pacemaker cells, phase 0 depends on the activation of L-type calcium channels instead of the activation of voltage-gated fast sodium channels, which are responsible for initiating action potentials in contractile (non-pacemaker) cells. For this reason, the pacemaker action potential rising phase slope is more gradual than that of the contractile cell (image 2).

=== Phase 3Repolarization ===
The reversal of membrane potential triggers the opening of potassium leak channels, resulting in the rapid loss of potassium ions from the inside of the cell, causing repolarization (Vm gets more negative). The calcium channels are also inactivated soon after they open. In addition, as sodium channels become inactivated, sodium permeability into the cell is decreased. These ion concentration changes slowly repolarize the cell to resting membrane potential (-60mV). Another important note at this phase is that ionic pumps restore ion concentrations to pre-action potential status. The sodium-calcium exchanger ionic pump works to pump calcium out of the intracellular space, thus effectively relaxing the cell. The sodium/potassium pump restores ion concentrations of sodium and potassium ions by pumping sodium out of the cell and pumping (exchanging) potassium into the cell. Restoring these ion concentrations is vital because it enables the cell to reset itself and enables it to repeat the process of spontaneous depolarization leading to activation of an action potential.

==Clinical significance==
===Damage to the SA node===
If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. This center is typically represented by cells inside the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is an area between the atria and ventricles, within the atrial septum. If the AV node also fails, Purkinje fibers are occasionally capable of acting as the default or &quot;escape&quot; pacemaker.

===Ectopic pacemaker===

An ectopic pacemaker also known as an ectopic focus or ectopic foci, is an excitable group of cells that causes a premature heart beat outside the normally functioning SA node of the heart. It is thus a cardiac pacemaker that is ectopic, producing an ectopic beat. If chronic this can result in arhythmias such as tachycardia, bradycardia, or ventricular fibrillation. An artificial pacemaker may be used to counter this.

====Artificial pacemakers====

An artificial cardiac pacemaker (or artificial pacemaker, so as not to be confused with the natural cardiac pacemaker) or just pacemaker is an implanted medical device that generates electrical impulses delivered by electrodes to the chambers of the heart either the upper atria, or lower ventricles to cause the targeted chambers to contract and pump blood. By doing so, the artificial pacemaker takes over from the primary SA node pacemaker to regulate the function of the heart&#x27;s electrical conduction system.

<doc id="233434" wikidata="Q7872413" url="?curid=233434" title="USS Ohio (1812)">
<text>USS &quot;Ohio&quot; was a schooner &quot;launched at Cleveland in 1810 by merchants named Murray and Bigsbey.&quot; purchased by the US Navy in 1812; converted to a warship by Henry Eckford; and commissioned prior to 13 June 1813, with Sailing Master Daniel Dobbins in command.

&quot;Ohio&quot; served on Lake Erie in the squadron commanded by Captain Oliver Hazard Perry during the War of 1812. The squadron&#x27;s mission was to wrest control of the lake from the British. With four other purchased ships, &quot;Ohio&quot; lay at Black Rock below the Falls in the Niagara River, prevented by British blockade from entering Lake Erie. Finally, in a combined operation with the Army, Perry was able to bring the ships out to join the remainder of the squadron in Presque Isle Bay at Erie, Pennsylvania. &quot;Ohio&quot; arrived at Erie on 8 July 1813.

After searching for the British, the squadron anchored at Sandusky on 17 August. &quot;Ohio&quot; returned to Erie for provisions and stores for the squadron, rejoining her sister ships on 3 September. The same day she set sail for Erie again, and thus was not with the squadron when it won the memorable victory over the British at Put-in Bay on 10 September. Three days later &quot;Ohio&quot; reached Put-in Bay with sorely needed fresh vegetables and meat.

As soon as the ice cleared in early 1814, &quot;Ohio&quot; began patrolling between Long Point and Erie to intercept any British movement by water. In May she assisted in fitting out prizes and at Put-in Bay, and convoyed them to Erie. 

On 12 August 1814, &quot;Ohio&quot; was captured along with the schooner by the British within pistol shot of Fort Erie. &quot;Somers&quot; was renamed &quot;Huron&quot; while &quot;Ohio&quot; was renamed &quot;Sauk.&quot; &quot;[T]he &quot;Sauk (ex-Ohio)&quot; and &quot;Huron (ex-Somers)&quot; were taken up Chippewa Creek and submerged in one of its tributaries, Street&#x27;s Creek, just in case the American tried to recapture them in a raid across the Niagara.&quot; The schooners were raised and refitted in the spring of 1815. They both wintered at the Royal Navy station at the mouth of the Grand River.
The &quot;Ohio&#x27;s&quot; subsequent history is unknown after 1817.

<text>The second USS &quot;Ohio&quot; was a ship of the line of the United States Navy, rated at 74 guns, although her total number of guns was 104. She was designed by Henry Eckford, laid down at Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1817, and launched on 30 May 1820. She went into ordinary and in the ensuing years decayed badly. Refitted for service in 1838, &quot;Ohio&quot; sailed on 16 October 1838 to join the Mediterranean Squadron under Commodore Isaac Hull. Acting as flagship for two years, she protected commerce and suppressed the slave trade off the African coast. &quot;Ohio&quot; proved to have excellent performance under sail, repeatedly making more than . One of her officers stated, &quot;I never supposed such a ship could be built—a ship possessing in so great a degree all the qualifications of a perfect vessel.&quot; In 1840, &quot;Ohio&quot; returned to Boston, where she again went into ordinary. From 1841 to 1846, &quot;Ohio&quot; served as receiving ship.

To meet the needs of the Mexican–American War, &quot;Ohio&quot; was recommissioned on 7 December 1846, and sailed on 4 January 1847 for the Gulf of Mexico, arriving off Veracruz on 22 March. &quot;Ohio&quot; landed 10 guns on 27 March to help in the siege of Veracruz; the city soon surrendered.

&quot;Ohio&quot; drew too much water for coastal operations in the gulf. However, 336 of her crew participated in the Tuxpan River Expedition. In 1847, the entire distance from the mouth of the river to the town was covered with thick jungle growth. The enemy had constructed three well-positioned forts on bluffs overlooking bends in the river. On 17 April, Commodore Matthew Perry arrived off the mouth of the river with 15 vessels. At 22:00, light-draft steamers &quot;Scourge&quot;, &quot;Spitfire&quot;, and &quot;Vixen&quot;, each towing a schooner, moved up stream. Bombships , , and followed closely while 30 surf boats containing 1,500 men brought up the rear. Approaching the town, the squadron came under hot fire from Fort LaPena. Cmdre. Perry ordered Commander Franklin Buchanan to disembark the surf boats and storm the fort. As the landing party swept ashore, the Mexicans abandoned their position. The other two forts fell in a like manner, with only light casualties sustained by the squadron. Men from &quot;Ohio&quot; retrieved the guns of brig &quot;Truxtun&quot;, which had foundered in a storm near Tuxpan on 16 September 1846. The town was occupied and all military stores destroyed.

Following Tuxpan, &quot;Ohio&quot; sailed from Veracruz and arrived in New York on 9 May. On 26 June, she sailed to bolster the Pacific Squadron, first carrying the U.S. minister to Brazil and operating off the east coast of South America until December. In Valparaíso on 21 January 1848, Cmdre. Thomas ap Catesby Jones took her as the flagship of the Pacific Squadron, intending to blockade the western Mexico ports. &quot;Ohio&quot; arrived at Mazatlán on 6 May, shortly after the Mexican–American War ended. Jones used the fleet to help transport to Monterey, California, those that had aided the United States in the war, arriving there on 9 October. &quot;Ohio&quot; then sailed to Sausalito, in San Francisco Bay. &quot;Ohio&quot; spent the next two years in the Pacific protecting commerce and policing the newly acquired California Territory during the chaotic early months of the gold rush. Scurvy struck the crew in the spring of 1849 in San Francisco Bay, so Jones sent &quot;Ohio&quot; to the Sandwich Islands for fresh food.

In 1850, she returned to Boston, where she again went into ordinary. In 1851, &quot;Ohio&quot; became a receiving ship and continued this duty until again placed in ordinary in 1875. &quot;Ohio&quot; was sold at Boston to J. L. Snow of Rockland, Maine on 27 September 1883. She was burned in the following year, in Greenport Harbor, New York; the remains are still accessible to scuba divers. The wreck is off Fanning Point, in about of water.

<text>Skywalker Sound is the American sound effects, sound editing, sound design, sound mixing and music recording division of Lucasfilm. Founded in 1975, the company&#x27;s main facilities are located at George Lucas&#x27;s Skywalker Ranch in Lucas Valley, near Nicasio, California.

== History ==
Skywalker Sound was founded as Sprocket Systems in San Anselmo, California.

While located in San Anselmo, Sprocket Systems came into contact with the local residents from time to time. For instance, Kentfield resident Pat Welsh was &quot;discovered&quot; while shopping at a camera store and went on to provide the voice for E.T. During the sound recording of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, Harrison Ford practiced his bullwhip technique in the parking lot.

Sprocket Systems moved from San Anselmo following a disastrous flood in January 1982. The company changed its name to Skywalker Sound in 1987 after the company moved to Skywalker Ranch.

Skywalker Sound&#x27;s staff of sound designers and re-recording mixers have either won or been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound and Best Sound Editing every year since &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1977; in that year, Ben Burtt was given a Special Achievement Award, since the category for Sound Editing had not yet been established. Skywalker Sound has won 15 Academy Awards and received 62 nominations.

Mixing stages, editorial services, and scoring stages are all located in a central &quot;Tech Building,&quot; with dining areas and living quarters in the vicinity but separate from the main work area.

In 2012, The Walt Disney Company acquired Skywalker Sound as part of its purchase of Lucasfilm.

<text>A yearbook, also known as an annual, is a type of a book published annually. One use is to record, highlight, and commemorate the past year of a school. The term also refers to a book of statistics or facts published annually. A yearbook often has an overarching theme that is present throughout the entire book.

Many high schools, colleges, elementary and middle schools publish yearbooks; however, many schools are dropping yearbooks or decreasing page counts given social media alternatives to a mass-produced physical photographically-oriented record. From 1995 to 2013, the number of U.S. college yearbooks dropped from roughly 2,400 to 1,000. 
==History==
A marble slab commemorating a class of military cadets in Ancient Athens during the time of the Roman Empire is an early example of this sort of document. Proto-yearbooks in the form of scrapbooks appeared in US East Coast schools towards the end of the 17th century. The first formal modern yearbook was the 1806 Profiles of Part of the Class Graduated at Yale College. Because printed photography did not yet exist, the 1806 Yale College yearbook included printed silhouettes of the students. 

In the early 20th century, yearbooks became more accessible following the invention of the printing press; instead of hand-bound journals, yearbooks became mass-produced and machine bound. 

==Yearbooks by country==

===Australia===
Yearbooks published by Australian schools follow a consistent structure to their North American counterparts. Australian yearbooks function as an annual magazine for the school body, with a significant focus on objectively reporting the events that occurred during the schooling year. Yearbook staff predominantly consists of only one or two school teachers who serve as editors in chief. Australian school yearbooks are predominantly created on A4 paper size, featuring a softcover style front-and-back cover, typically 250 or 300 g/m2 density. Hardcover-style yearbooks are not as common, although exceptions occur.

 This is sold as allowing a higher level of student involvement whilst making the workflow simpler and easier for all involved. Additionally, some schools feature a separate yearbook for students in year 2.

==== Publishing ====
Australian school yearbooks are primarily published with technology, with a mix of color, spot color, and black and white pages, depending on the school&#x27;s budget.

=== India ===
India does not have a long history of publishing school yearbooks. However, top Business schools and Engineering colleges publish custom yearbooks. This is typically created by the final-year students of the batch. A yearbook or a memory book would consist of testimonials and common pages such as the Director&#x27;s address and events, and festivals&#x27; picture collages.

Most top schools create school magazines that are shared with each student. Some of the early adopters among school students are starting to create custom yearbooks along the same lines as those created by students from the US or Europe. This trend is likely to pick up with the advent of technology platforms that make it easy for students to create them.

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, it is very common to find yearbooks in schools as it is in countries such as the US and Canada, though several schools allocate annual funding and publish yearbooks at the end of the school year (July or August). These yearbooks closely resemble those found in the US, with columns about certain themes, in-depth coverage of major events, and large collections of photos, as well as drawings reflecting daily life at these schools. Some schools do produce yearbooks yearly.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, it is not as common to find yearbooks in schools as it is in countries such as the US and Canada, though several schools allocate annual funding and publish yearbooks at the end of the school year (November or December). These yearbooks closely resemble those found in the US, with columns about certain themes, in-depth coverage of major events, and large collections of photos, as well as drawings reflecting daily life at these schools.

Major events covered include Matric Farewell Dances (equivalent to Senior Prom in the US), annual sporting events (such as Inter-schools where several schools assemble and compete in various sports as well as with dance routines in competition for spirit awards, etc.), and grade group events organized specifically for a specific grade.

===United States===
Elementary and middle schools may have a designated staff member who is in charge of putting together that school&#x27;s yearbook, with or without the help of the students. These books are usually considerably smaller and often paperbound than a later secondary school / high school or college / university yearbook.

High school yearbooks generally cover a wide variety of topics from academics, student life, sports, clubs, and other major school events. Generally, each student is pictured with their class, while seniors might get a page-width picture or a slightly larger photo than the underclassmen to reflect their status in the school. Each school organization, such as a sports team or academic/social club, is usually pictured. A high school yearbook staff consists of students with one or more faculty advisors. The yearbook staff can be chosen in a variety of ways, including volunteer extracurricular organization, academic class, or assigned to the entire senior class.

High school yearbooks are considered a form of journalism by scholastic journalism organizations such as the Columbia Scholastic Press Association (established 1925 and associated with the Columbia University and its School of Professional Studies (formerly by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism), at landmark Low Memorial Library on the Morningside Heights campus of northwest Manhattan in New York City); the National Scholastic Press Association, (founded 1921 - affiliated with the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis), along with the Journalism Education Association (formed 1924, headquartered in Manhattan, Kansas, also the home of the nearby Kansas State University), and other numerous state and regional scholastic press associations. Numerous levels of awards are given based on judging competitions for journalistic excellence annually, often at the nationwide or state / regional press conventions / conferences and seminars for school / college media.

Colleges that publish yearbooks follow a similar format to high schools. Some include detailed recaps of football and basketball games. College yearbooks are considered by the Associated Collegiate Press (ACP) to be a form of journalism. ACP holds the annual Pacemaker competition for college yearbooks as well as other collegiate media outlets. Many colleges have phased out yearbooks due to high prices and low demand, while some, like Auburn University, opt to support annual publications with relatively small portions of student fees to continue this over 120-year-old tradition. &quot;The Glomerata&quot; continues to be one of the most circulated yearbooks in the country, distributing 8,000 copies to Auburn University&#x27;s student body in April 2018.

====U.S. military====
Warships of the United States Navy often produce a yearbook-style publication upon completion of a long deployment (typically six months or more). These books, referred to by sailors as &quot;cruise books&quot; are produced on board by the ship&#x27;s Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Department and Public Affairs staff, and then printed ashore by the same printing companies that publish high school and college yearbooks. The cruise book of a &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier typically reaches over 600 pages in length, as it includes portraits of the more than 5,000 sailors and Marines assigned to the ship&#x27;s company and embarked carrier air wing.

The Navy&#x27;s Recruit Training Center in Great Lakes, Illinois also produces yearbook-style publications for each graduating division of recruits. These publications are much smaller, as each recruit division totals roughly 80 sailors. The book is called &quot;The Keel&quot; after the part of a ship that is constructed first, as RTC or boot camp sets the foundation for the sailor&#x27;s career. These books contain a color section common to all books published that year, with a specific black and white section added for each recruit division and their &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot; division.

==Production and distribution==

===Compilation===
Yearbooks are generally compiled by a student club or a yearbook class, usually advised by a faculty member. The yearbook staff usually has one or more editors who are responsible for collecting and compiling all of the information to be contained within the book, as well as deciding the layout and allocation of space for each contributor.

====Sections====
Most yearbooks have a similar format, which includes individual photographs of students, and information on activities, sports, and other activities.

=====People (seniors, underclassmen, faculty)=====
In the U.S., where a yearbook often covers the whole school and not just the senior class, these sections are usually arranged in chronological order by class (freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior), in either ascending or descending order. Normally students will have individual portraits accompanied by their names. Senior photographs are usually larger than those of underclassmen and are sometimes accompanied by text about their accomplishments throughout high school and their plans. Frequently, seniors are polled to nominate their classmates for &quot;superlatives&quot; or &quot;class celebrities&quot; (such as &quot;most likely to succeed&quot;, &quot;most athletic&quot;, &quot;most spirited&quot;, &quot;best smile&quot;, and &quot;class clown&quot;), are often published in the senior section. In addition, seniors typically wear formal attire and individuals select quotes that they feel represent themselves. Some private schools and smaller high schools set aside an entire page for each senior. These pages are sometimes designed by the seniors themselves, with each senior submitting a digital or physical version of the page they would like featured in the book.

&quot;Picture Day&quot; is the school day in the United States and Canada when students have their photographs taken by a professional photographer. Parents can purchase packages of these portraits to distribute, often accompanied by other items featuring the portrait. The pictures are not inexpensive for the amount of time and effort involved – which can be less than one minute per student – partly because the photography company usually pays the school part of the price for each photo sold in a &quot;rebate&quot; or unadvertised &quot;fundraising&quot; scheme. These portraits often go into the school yearbook, which is usually distributed at the end of the school year. The pictures may also be used on student ID cards. There will also generally be a second day (&quot;retake day&quot;) to take pictures if the student is absent.

In the UK and other countries, where yearbooks often only cover the final year group and not the entire school, each student may have more space for answers to various questions as well as their photo (or photos). In Year 11 (England &amp; Wales) members are usually grouped by form/class; whilst Year 13 tends not to be grouped in such a way, but instead, just appears alphabetically throughout the book. It is common in these markets for each person to have between a quarter and a whole page each, depending on the budget available for the yearbook (as more pages mean a higher cost). The editorial team chooses questions for members to answer (such as &quot;Favourite teacher?&quot; or &quot;Where will you be in 5 years?&quot;) and these answers appear alongside member photos. These photos and answers are sometimes also collected online.

=====Student life=====
Several pages are often used for pages chronicling activities undertaken by students, such as trips abroad, activity trips, sports, and other special events. This part of the book often covers students&#x27; lives both inside and outside of the campus.

Sometimes members of a yearbook write editorial and journalistic content about life as a student, current events (local, national, and international), and other matters of interest to the peer group.

=====Academics/education=====
This section covers the classes, projects, and more educational aspects of the school year.

=====Organizations=====
This section describes student organizations (sometimes referred to as clubs) and what they did during the year. These descriptions are often accompanied by a photo or photos of the organization&#x27;s members. This section sometimes includes a list of the members of each organization.

=====Sports=====
Often listed by season or club, these pages chronicle the accomplishments of the school&#x27;s teams. Along with a short article listing the season&#x27;s highlights, these pages include team photographs and action pictures.

=====Advertising pages=====

Many yearbooks gain revenue by including a section of ads from local businesses.

Some schools sell advertisements for seniors. Parents, other family members, and friends use these ads to congratulate a senior — or group of seniors — for their accomplishments.

=====Index=====
Bigger yearbooks tend to include an alphabetical listing of everyone included in the yearbook, along with a listing of the pages they may be found on.

=====Colophon=====
Usually, near the end of the book, the colophon lists staff members and acknowledgments. The colophon includes technical information about the yearbook such as publisher, the total number of pages, paperweight, and copyright.

=====Signature or autograph page=====
Some yearbooks contain a few pages that will be left blank for people to write messages about the preceding year and summer. This tradition was inherited from commonplace books.

=== Design ===

Students may design yearbook pages themselves or use company-provided templates in most cases.

In general, most yearbook pages are designed as double-page spreads and include several items:
* Headline: An abbreviated sentence highlighting the content of the spread, usually involving wordplay along with factual information
* Story/Copy: Staff usually write short stories capturing the highlights of a specific department, sports season, organization, etc., from the past year. Often, yearbook staff members will interview students, teachers, and others for comments. Alternative story formats have gained popularity in recent times, allowing stories to be told in visual ways (graphs, charts, polls, timelines, etc.).
* Photographs: Every spread that isn&#x27;t a portrait or an ad spread contains candid shots of students, suitable to the page&#x27;s topic and theme. Included with the photographs are one or more captions, which describe each picture; these often begin with a.

In the past, most yearbooks were laid out by hand, with photographs physically cropped and placed on layout boards. The work was tedious and required multiple deadlines and contact with a yearbook publisher. Today, virtually all yearbooks are published using computers, which allows for shorter deadlines and easier editing. Students typically design pages using a desktop publishing program, usually Adobe InDesign. Some schools use a proprietary web-based design program belonging to the company that prints the book.

===Publication===

==== U.S. printing companies ====
Yearbook printing companies usually have representatives who work with the adviser and staff at each school to assist in the creation of the yearbook.

Yearbook companies that use offset printing require that groups of pages be sent periodically, rather than all at once, to the plant. This is done to stagger the work required to complete yearbooks for all the schools they cover. After the editors review each page and make changes, the pages are sent to the yearbook plant, usually via the Internet. Yearbook companies that use digital printing methods may only require one submission since the entire book is printed at once.

If the proofing process is not performed online, the adviser and editors receive proofs (typically full-size prints) about a week or so after the submission of pages. This gives the school a final opportunity to make adjustments or changes. After all the proofs have been returned to the printing company the requested corrections are made, and the books are printed, bound, and then sent to the school for distribution. Two examples of printing companies include Balfour and Jostens.

Several educational institutions and yearbook printing companies operate camps and summer sessions at which student yearbook personnel can learn or polish the skills they need in their work.

===Distribution===
Often, yearbooks are distributed at the end of a school year to allow students, teachers, and other members of the school to obtain the books and signatures/personal messages from classmates. In the U.S., those that distribute at this time may publish a supplemental insert with photographs from spring sports and milestone events (such as prom and graduation) and other important events. Many schools at which yearbooks are distributed at or before the end of a school year have a tradition of having students sign and leave notes on each other&#x27;s yearbooks.

Some schools distribute yearbooks after the end of the school year—such as in July, at homecoming (US) in October, or at another designated time to include year-end activities. In some cases, yearbooks are mailed to the parents&#x27; homes of graduated seniors.

===Digital yearbooks===
A digital yearbook or is a yearbook holding memories of a given time with a given group of people—most commonly, a school year at a particular school—that exists in digital form.

A digital yearbook may contain text, images, audio, and video. While a traditional paper yearbook may contain 300+ pages, a digital yearbook can contain unlimited pages. The end product of a digital yearbook can be a CD-ROM, a DVD, or is captured in an eBook format. The first CD-ROM yearbook was created by students at South Eugene High School in 1990.

In 2014 Forever Connected created the first widely adopted interactive, mobile yearbook, based on the print edition. Students can sign, sticker, and send videos to classmates right from their mobile devices. It is the most widely used digital yearbook and was originally sold by traditional yearbook publishers and as an add-on to print purchases. In 2019 Forever Connected rebranded as FC Yearbook and began offering their platform directly to schools. Several patents were awarded on the technology to the parent company Yearbooker, Inc. 
In 2021 FC Yearbook accommodated remote and in-person student signatures and offered a print edition with the digital signatures printed in the book, as a direct-to-home offer. This became the origin of &quot;virtual yearbook day&quot; where in-person and remote students could simultaneously sign each other&#x27;s yearbook at a yearbook party. On May 14, 2021, FC Yearbook announced the first print yearbook ordered from a digital yearbook in an app, marking &quot;digital-first&quot; as a unique change in the yearbook commerce model.

In 2025 Idiom Publishing introduced the first digital yearbook, YearBoxx, designed specifically for digital devices (cellphones, tablets, laptops). Earlier digital yearbooks have been PDF copies based on a print yearbook. YearBoxx preserves all the features that have made print yearbooks a 160-year-old tradition and introduced features specific to digital.

Yearbooks can now have unlimited pages, embedded videos, updatability, and no deadlines to name a few features. The greatly reduced price of digital yearbooks gives students the opportunity to afford both a print yearbook, to have as an archival copy as well as a digital yearbook that will be accessible anywhere, anytime and can be updated and interacted with for life.

The migration to digital should open a great deal of innovative features that will redefine what a yearbook is.

<doc id="233438" wikidata="Q170578" url="?curid=233438" title="Aracaju">
<text>Aracaju () is the capital of the state of Sergipe, Brazil, located in the northeastern part of the country on the coast, about 350 km (217 mi) north of Salvador. According to the 2020 estimate, the city has 664,908 inhabitants, which represents approximately 33% of the state population. Adding to the populations of the municipalities forming the Metropolitan area: Barra dos Coqueiros, Nossa Senhora do Socorro and São Cristóvão. Its Metropolitan Cathedral Nossa Senhora da Conceiçao, dedicated to Our Lady of Immaculate Conception, is the archiepiscopal see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Aracaju.

== History ==

The extinct unclassified Boime language (also spelled &quot;Poyme&quot;) was spoken by indigenous peoples near Aracajú on the São Francisco River.

The land of present-day Aracaju was located in a &quot;sesmaria&quot; given to Pero Gonçalves by the Portuguese crown around 1602. The land consisted of of coastline with small fishing villages. A village called Santo Antônio de Aracaju was recorded in 1699. It was located at the mouth of the Sergipe River at the Atlantic Ocean, and was founded by João Mulato, an indigenous Brazilian. The settlement saw little growth in the 18th century, and was part of the parish of Nossa Senhora do Perpétuo Socorro do Tomar do Cotinguiba. The capital of São Cristóvão presented numerous difficulties as the capital of Sergipe, primarily its inland location. São Cristóvão had only a small port on a river, and was accessed only with small boats. As a result, large ships were unable to land in Sergipe. Government officials in Sergipe began a search for land for a new capital in the 1850s. The beach that is now located in Aracaju near the mouth of the Sergipe River was a major point of interest. The state government transferred the customs and the Provincial Revenue Bureau to that location. They additionally built a post office and police sub-station. In addition, a port was built on the beach, called Atalaia.

The capital of the state of Sergipe was moved from São Cristóvão to Aracaju on March 17, 1855.

== Economy ==
The economy is based on services and industry.

The GDP for the city was (2013).

In recent years, the city has been invigorated by major investors from both eastern Europe (especially from Belarus and Russia) and China setting to be a key city on the Brics relations worldwide as well as a &#x27;Mercocity&#x27; (adopted from Mercosur).

=== Tourism and recreation ===
The city has emerged as a good choice in low-cost tourism. Seen and recognized as one of the safest (63 murders per 100,000; No. 12 city in world; List of cities by murder rate) capitals in the Northeast region and the lowest costs of living in the country, more recently has focused its tourism business in creating quality accommodation, such as world-renowned hostels. Planned public transportation improvements were aimed at increasing the comfort and integration to the visitors users. In advance of seeking access facilities, bus lines have been reformed and can be monitored in real time here

=== Sports ===
At the 2016 Summer Olympics the city hosted teams from seven countries. Football athletes from Japan and gymnasts and swimmers curiously mostly from many eastern European countries like Poland, Austria, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Czech Republic established the city as home-base for training.

For the 2016 Summer Paralympics Games the city is accommodating athletes from Eurasian Economic Community countries such as the Kazakhstani paralympic team and the Belarus paralympic team, including paralympic swimmer champion Ihar Boki.

== Transportation ==

===Air===
Aracaju is served by Santa Maria Airport, a domestic commercial airport. It dates to 1952 and became fully functional in 1958. The airport is located in the Santa Maria neighborhood of the city and is located from downtown Aracaju.

===Roads===
Aracaju is located on the northern segment of BR-101, a major north–south longitudinal highway in Brazil. It is also the easternmost point of BR-235, an incomplete highway which is projected to run from Aracaju west to Novo Progresso, Pará.

==Educational institutions==

<text>The Belice, , is a river of western Sicily. It is about long. From its main source near Piana degli Albanesi it runs south and west for as the Belice Destro (&quot;right Belice&quot;) until it is joined near Poggioreale by its secondary branch, the Belice Sinistro (&quot;left Belice&quot;), which rises on the slopes of Rocca Busambra. The Belice proper then flows for another or so before entering the Strait of Sicily to the east of the ancient Greek archaeological site of Selinunte. During Classical times it was known as the &quot;Hypsas&quot;.

==History==
The middle section of the Belice valley was hit by the January 1968 Belice earthquake which completely destroyed numerous centres of population, including Gibellina, Montevago and Salaparuta. Three hundred and seventy people died, a thousand were injured and some 70,000 people were made homeless.

<doc id="233443" wikidata="Q1163838" url="?curid=233443" title="Expanding bullet">
<text>Expanding bullets, also known colloquially as dumdum bullets, are projectiles designed to expand on impact. This causes the bullet to increase in diameter, to combat over-penetration and produce a larger wound, thus dealing more damage to a living target. For this reason, they are used for hunting and by police departments, but are generally prohibited for use in war. Two typical designs are the hollow-point bullet and the soft-point bullet.

==Function and use==
Expanding bullets are designed to expand on impact, sometimes as much as twice the diameter. This will slow the bullet down and more of its kinetic energy will be transferred to the target, creating a larger wound channel. For this reason, expanding bullets are often used in hunting because their stopping power increases the chance of a quick kill. There are a number of designs used for hunting different game and for use in weapons with different muzzle velocities. Bullets used for medium and large game need better penetration, which means bullets designed to maintain integrity and for less expansion. The velocities at which the bullets hit affect their expansion and penetration.

Expanding bullets are less likely to pass through the target, and if they do, they will exit at a lower velocity. This reduces the risk of accidental injury to bystanders. For this reason, and to maximize the stopping effect, law enforcement organizations use expanding bullets. Even then, some penetration is needed, e.g., to penetrate a windshield or heavy clothing. Such a bullet would have less possibility of penetrating body armour or heavy equipment worn on the body.

==Names==

Expanding bullets were called &quot;Dum-Dum&quot; or &quot;dumdum&quot; after an early British example produced in the Dum Dum Arsenal, near Calcutta, India by Captain Neville Bertie-Clay. There were several expanding bullets produced by this arsenal for the .303 British cartridge, including soft-point and hollow-point designs. These were not the first expanding bullets, however; hollow-point expanding bullets were commonly used for hunting thin-skinned game in express rifles as early as the mid-1870s.

Also, the .303 was not the first military round with that trait since the old .577 Snider bullet had a hollow core, leaving wounds known for being particularly nasty. The use of the term &quot;dumdum&quot; for expanding bullets other than the early .303 designs is considered slang by most ammunition and ballistics sources. Manufacturers have many terms to describe the particular construction of the various types of expanding bullets, though most fall into the category of soft-point or hollow-point designs. The expansion itself is sometimes called &quot;mushrooming&quot;.

Another early name was General Tweedie&#x27;s &quot;mushroom bullet&quot;, cited in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1892.

==History==

Early bullets were typically made in the form of spheres of nearly pure lead, which is a very soft metal. These would often flatten upon impact with the target, causing a wound larger than the original diameter of the ball. The adoption of rifling allowed the use of longer, heavier bullets, but these were still typically constructed of soft lead and would often double in diameter upon impact. In this case expansion was a side effect of materials, and there is no evidence that the bullets were designed to expand upon impact.

The earliest examples of bullets specifically designed to expand on impact were those fired by express rifles, which were developed in the mid-19th century. Express rifles used larger powder charges and lighter bullets than typical for the time to achieve very high velocities for black powder cartridges. One method of lightening the bullets used was to provide a deep cavity in the nose of the bullet. These were the first hollow-point bullets, and in addition to developing higher velocities, they also expanded significantly upon impact. These hollow-point bullets worked well on thin-skinned game, but tended to come apart on bigger game, resulting in insufficient penetration. One solution to this was the &quot;cruciform expanding bullet&quot;, a solid bullet with a cross-shaped incision in the tip. This split section expanded only to the depth of the incision, making it an early form of controlled expansion bullet.

In the late 19th century, the invention of cordite and other nitrocellulose-based &quot;smokeless&quot; propellants permitted higher bullet-velocities than black powder, resulting in flatter trajectories and correspondingly higher hit probabilities. Attempts to limit recoil to an acceptable level led to higher-velocity rounds generally being smaller in diameter and lighter. To prevent lead fouling in the bore caused by the higher pressures and velocities, soft lead bullets were replaced by newly introduced full metal jacket bullets.

However, it soon became apparent that such hard, small-caliber rounds were less effective at wounding or killing an enemy than the older, large-caliber soft lead bullets. Within the British Indian Army, the Dum Dum Arsenal produced a solution: the jacketing was removed from the nose of the bullet, creating the first soft-point bullets. Since the Mark II jacket did not cover the base of the round, this could potentially lead to the jacketing being left in the barrel. This potential problem resulted in the rejection of the Dum Dum design and led to independent development of the Mark III, Mark IV (1897) and Mark V (1899) .303 British rounds, which were of the hollow-point design, with the jacket covering the base; while these were made in Britain, not at the Dum Dum Arsenal, the name &quot;Dum-dum&quot; had already become associated with expanding bullets, and continued to be used to refer to any expanding bullets. The expanding bullets expanded upon impact to a diameter significantly greater than the original .312 inch (7.92 mm) bullet diameter, producing larger diameter wounds than the full-metal-jacketed versions. The Mark IV was successful enough in its first use in the Battle of Omdurman that British soldiers issued with the standard Mark II bullets began to remove the top of the jacket, converting the Mark II bullets into improvised Dum-dum types.

In 1898, the German government lodged a protest against the use of the Mark IV bullet, claiming the wounds produced by the Mark IV were excessive and inhumane, thus violating the laws of war. The protest, however, was based on the comparison of the wounds produced by expanding and non-expanding bullets from high-velocity sporting rifles, rather than on comparison of the expanding .303 British bullets with the previous, large-bore service cartridge it replaced, the .577/450 Martini-Henry. With the energy on impact roughly the same, the wounds caused by the expanding bullet of the .303 were less severe than those caused by the larger-caliber, solid lead bullet used by the Martini-Henry.

The German protests were effective, however, resulting in the ban of the use of expanding bullets in warfare. The British replaced the hollow-point bullets with new full metal jacket bullets and used the remaining stocks of expanding bullets for practice.

During the Hague Convention of 1899, the majority of the delegates moved to prohibit future usage of expanding bullets, which was opposed by the American and British delegations. Historian Barbara Tuchman wrote that, 

However, the rest of the delegates at the 1899 Hague Convention were not persuaded by Ardagh&#x27;s arguments and voted 22–2 to prohibit the future use of the dumdum bullet.

==International law==
The Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III prohibits the use of expanding bullets in international warfare. This is often incorrectly believed to be prohibited by the Geneva Conventions, but it significantly predates those conventions, and is in fact a continuance of the Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868, which had earlier banned exploding projectiles of less than .

The text of the declaration states, &quot;The present Declaration is only binding for the Contracting Powers in the case of a war between two or more of them&quot;. Until relatively recently, the prohibition on the use of expanding bullets was applicable only to international armed conflicts between the countries that have signed it. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross&#x27;s customary international law study, customary international law now prohibits their use in any armed conflicts. This has been disputed by the United States, which maintains that the use of expanding bullets can be legal when there is a clear military necessity. The adoption of an amendment to Article 8 at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute in Kampala (2010) makes the use of expanding bullets in non-international armed conflict a war crime. One example of a war crime involving expanding ammunition is the August 1941 German killing of Soviet prisoners at Zhitomir, as a human experiment with captured Red Army materiel.

Because The Hague Convention applies only to the use of expanding bullets in war, the use of expanding rounds remains legal in other circumstances unless it is restricted or prohibited by local laws. Examples are use of expanding bullets in hunting in which it is desirable to stop the animal quickly, either to prevent loss of a game animal or to ensure a humane death of the animal, and in law enforcement or self-defence, if quickly neutralising an aggressor may be needed to prevent further loss of life or the bullet must remain inside the target to prevent collateral damage.

<text>João Pessoa () is a port city in northeastern Brazil. It is the largest city in, and capital of, the state of Paraíba with an estimated population of 833,932 (as of 2022). It is located on the right bank of the Paraíba do Norte river.

The new &quot;Estação Ciência, Cultura e Artes&quot; (Science, Culture and Art Station), located at the most eastern point of the Americas (&quot;Ponta do Seixas&quot;), is an educational and cultural institution as well as a national landmark. The complex, inaugurated in 2008, was created by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and is one of his final projects.

The capital of Paraíba received the title of Creative City by UNESCO in 2017, appointing João Pessoa as &quot;Brazilian city of handicrafts&quot;.

==History==
The city of João Pessoa was founded on August 5, 1585, during the celebration of the peace pact between the Portuguese represented by the Portuguese João Tavares, and the indigenous people, represented by the Piragibe Indian, chief of the Tabajara, on the banks of the Paraíba River. The French inhabited the locality, and had an alliance with the indigenous tribe of Potiguaras. With the alliance of the Portuguese with the Tabajaras (rivals of the Potiguaras), the Portuguese colonists, led by Frutuoso Barbosa, finally managed to expel the French and conquer Paraíba. After the conquest, they built the forts of São Tiago and São Felipe. They brought masons, carpenters, engineers and others to build the City of Nossa Senhora das Neves. With the beginning of the works, they went to Baía da Traição to expel the rest of the French who remained in Paraíba. There was the nomination of João Tavares to be the captain of the Fort.

The Royal City of Nossa Senhora das Neves was the third city to be founded in Brazil, with the signing of an agreement between João Tavares and the chief Piragibe of the Tabajaras. Called &quot;Royal City of Our Lady of the Snows&quot;, in honor of the saint of the day it was founded, its first structures were on the banks of the Sanhauá River, a tributary of the Paraíba River, now known as Porto do Varadouro, in the neighborhood of the same name.

In 1588, the city was renamed &quot;Philipeia of Our Lady of the Snows&quot;, in honor of King Philip II, who at the time accumulated the thrones of Spain and Portugal.

In 1634, attracted by the sugar wealth of the then-capital of the Paraíba, the Dutch invaded and named it Fredrikstad (Frederick City), in honor of the prince of Orange, Frederick of Orange, was one of the two main cities of New Holland, brought the town a period of great prosperity, the installation of mills on the coast enabled greater efficiency in sugar production, with the main consequence being the guarantee of large profits, but, on the other hand, it required the practice of monoculture that was developed in increasing extensions of land, the latifundia. After the decline of New Holland and with the departure of the Dutch, the city was again dominated by the Portuguese and acquired the name &quot;Parahyba do Norte&quot; in 1654.

The city was renamed João Pessoa in September 1930 in memory of the former governor of Paraíba, João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque, who had been a vice-presidential candidate and was murdered on 26 July that year.

João Pessoa is the third oldest city in Brazil.

==Geography==

===Environment===

João Pessoa has of beachfront.

João Pessoa has many green areas distributed among its avenues, parks, and residential neighborhoods, supporting its claim as &quot;the second greenest city in the world&quot; with more than of forested land, second only to Paris. This claim is a matter of conjecture, however, originating from a publicity stunt carried out by the city&#x27;s mayor during an Earth Summit.

===Hydrography===
In João Pessoa, there are about twelve rivers. The Jaguaribe River is born in the Esplanada complex, crosses the Benjamim Maranhão Botanical Garden, in the middle of the Atlantic Forest, and flows into the Atlantic Ocean on the border with the municipality of Cabedelo. The water to supply the houses is taken from the Gramame-Mumbaba system, from the Paraíba Water and Sewerage Company. In this system, these two rivers take turns to supply the city with water. However, the most historically important river is the Sanhauá River, because it was on its banks that the city was born and where the first houses were built.
There is also the Solón de Lucena Park Lagoon in the City Center. The lagoon was the main tourist spot in the city during the time when most of the city was far from the beaches. At the end of 2010, during the Christmas celebrations, the lagoon was revitalized and gained devices such as ambient music.

The capital of Paraíba has a coastline of about 24 kilometers in length, nine beaches in the municipality alone, in addition to the beaches of the Metropolitan Region, such as the city of Cabedelo, the city of Lucena and the District of Jacumã in the municipality of Conde, where the Tambaba Naturist Beach is located. Urban beaches are characterized by white sand beaches and crystal clear waters. Many have preserved the Atlantic Forest, as well as being ideal for bathing thanks to a natural barrier about 6 kilometers from the coast that protects a large part of the Pessoa and Cabedelo coast, allowing children to play in the calm waters. There is the Urban Tartarugas Project, which operates on the beaches of Bessa and Intermares, a spawning area for the hawksbill turtle, a scenario for environmental preservation. Surfing is also practiced in the city.

Among the main beaches, we can mention the &quot;Praia de Tambau&quot;, about 8 kilometers long, composed of fine, beaten sand, with blue-green waters; the &quot;bessa beach&quot; is where the caribessa is located, a quiet beach with crystalline waters; also the &quot;Praia de Manaíra&quot;, a totally urban beach, formed by coral reefs, which makes its waves weak and clear water in summer. It is the point of several kiosks and bars, with sports fields on its edge. The &quot;Cabo Branco beach&quot;, white sand and warm water; &quot;Playa Seixas&quot;, which is where the &quot;most eastern point of America&quot; is located. In addition to &quot;Praia da Penha&quot;, where the historic Chapel of Our Lady of Penha, built in 1763, where the penha pilgrimage takes place every year, from the historic center to the beach.; The &quot;Jacarape beach&quot;, where the Poet Ronaldo Cunha Lima Convention Center is located; then &quot;Praia do Sol&quot;, which is a quiet and airy place; and the &quot;barra de gramame beach&quot;, which situates the meeting of the river gramme with the sea.

===Climate===
João Pessoa has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) with very warm to hot temperatures all year long and strong rainfall in most of the months; however, October to December have rather low rainfall.

The city has a &quot;Benjamin Maranhão Botanical Garden&quot;, which preserves the Atlantic forest, the animals, and opens the visitation, which is the João Pessoa Botanical Garden, considered one of the largest remains of the natural Atlantic Forest in an urban area of Brazil.
 It is an excellent opportunity for people to be in contact with pure and crystalline nature. Among these, environmental education is a relevant element, allowing interesting approaches, from knowledge and interest in plants to stimulating curiosity and knowledge of this important space for visitation and research.

There are 18 stations distributed along the Rio and Preguiça trails using as criteria elements mainly related to history, botany and ecology, contributing to knowledge of the environment and the need for its preservation. The area has about 515ha, of which 343ha are home to the Botanical Garden, where the flora is not very soft in the recreational and educational activities promoted on the spot. It includes the largest natural urban Atlantic forest reserve in the country, and an important historical heritage of the capital of Paraíba.

<text>Ambient techno is a subgenre of techno that incorporates the atmospheric textures of ambient music with the rhythmic elements and production of techno. It was pioneered by 1990s electronic artists such as Aphex Twin, Carl Craig, The Orb, The Future Sound of London, the Black Dog, Pete Namlook and Biosphere.

==Characteristics and influences==
AllMusic states that ambient techno, building off the ambient house scene, blended the &quot;soaring, layered, aquatic atmospheres of beatless and experimental ambient&quot; with techno&#x27;s &quot;well-produced, thin-sounding electronics.&quot; Artists fused the &quot;environmentalist&quot; work of Brian Eno, Jon Hassell, and Wendy Carlos with the rhythms of urban dance styles such as techno and acid house. Ambient techno artists returned to the instruments of the Detroit techno and Chicago house scenes, including analogue synthesizers, the Roland TB-303 bass machine, and the TR-909 drum machine. Common elements included heavily reverbed string pads and subtle drum programming that moved beyond the simple patterns of 4/4 techno and house, while artists typically de-emphasized sampling. 

One principal influence on the genre was the 1984 album &quot;E2-E4&quot; by German musician Manuel Göttsching. The Orb&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld&quot; would inspire dub-influenced ambient techno. &quot;Artforum&quot; noted the genre&#x27;s similarities with new age: &quot;swaddling the listener in a womblike sound bath, it means retreat from the environment, relief from the stresses of urban existence.&quot; Critic Simon Reynolds characterized the style as a &quot;post-rave genre&quot; meant &quot;for immobile contemplation,&quot; comparing it to &quot;the aqua-mysticism and forest idylls of Claude Debussy.&quot; 

The style would be associated with labels such as Warp, Apollo, GPR, and Beyond, with releases focusing more on albums than 12-inch singles.

==History==
===Origins===
Ambient techno departed from the communal, dance-oriented sound heard at raves and instead gained popularity in the early 1990s as a form of &quot;electronic listening music.&quot; Artists such as Carl Craig, the Black Dog, and The Orb produced early works in the style. Carl Craig&#x27;s early releases as part of the Detroit techno scene (later collected on the compilation &quot;Elements 1989-1990&quot;) showcased an ambient style of &quot;narcoleptic, interior techno,&quot; and would inspire UK artists aiming to make atmospheric listening music. Aphex Twin&#x27;s 1991 recording &quot;Analogue Bubblebath&quot; would also signal a shift toward meditative, ambient-leaning techno, while his 1992 debut LP &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85-92&quot; became &quot;the flagship of the emergent genre&quot; according to &quot;SPIN&quot;. Producer Pete Namlook released a prodigious amount of music in the genre, starting the label Fax in 1992 and becoming a &quot;spiritual leader&quot; of the movement. 

Other prominent artists in the style included Irresistible Force, Global Communication, Higher Intelligence Agency, and Future Sound of London. According to AllMusic, early classics of the era included Aphex Twin&#x27;s debut LP, Ultramarine&#x27;s &quot;Every Man and Woman Is a Star&quot; (1991), Biosphere&#x27;s &quot;Microgravity&quot; (1991), and the Orb&#x27;s &quot;U.F.Orb&quot; (1992). Author Sean Albiez added Higher Intelligence Agency&#x27;s &quot;Colourform&quot; (1992) and the Black Dog&#x27;s &quot;Temple of Transparent Balls&quot; (1993) as early examples. The release of Warp&#x27;s &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; compilation in 1992 helped to establish the genre and featured ambient techno pioneers such Aphex Twin, B12, Autechre, the Black Dog, Richie Hawtin, and the Orb&#x27;s Alex Paterson. B12&#x27;s 1993 Warp album &quot;Electro-Soma&quot; was also called a classic of ambient techno by &quot;Resident Advisor&quot;. &quot;The Quietus&quot; characterized Luke Slater&#x27;s early-90s work under his 7th Plain moniker as important to the style&#x27;s development. Following the release of Warp&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence series, the genre developed further into the &quot;intelligent techno&quot; scene.

===Developments===
During the 1990s, compilation series such as &quot;Chill Out or Die&quot; popularized ambient techno and house. In reaction against the more &quot;cozy&quot; features of the early ambient techno scene, some artists would move toward a darker sound heard on releases such as Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; (1994) and projects by other &quot;ambient noir-ists&quot; such as Seefeel and the duo of David Toop &amp; Max Eastley. Virgin&#x27;s 1994 compilation &quot;Isolationism&quot; served as a summary of this darker tendency.

In the early-to mid-1990s, a small network of ambient techno artists developed around the Berlin-based labels Basic Channel and Chain Reaction. In 1995, producer Wolfgang Voigt began releasing influential ambient techno projects as Gas, bringing together lush and expansive atmospheres with 4/4 minimal techno beats. Voigt co-runs the German label Kompakt, which has released installments of the influential ambient techno compilation series &quot;Pop Ambient&quot; annually since 2001.

<text>The hingemouth (&quot;Phractolaemus ansorgii&quot;) is a small freshwater fish that is found only in west central Africa, the sole member of the family Phractolaemidae of the family Kneriidae.

The mouth can extend like a small trunk, thus the name, and has just two teeth, both in the lower jaw. Its mouth can extend up to 30% of the hingemouth&#x27;s head length. It has highly flexible lips, and its mouth is mainly supported by cartilage and other connective tissues. The swim bladder has two compartments, and can function as a lung, allowing the hingemouth to survive in oxygen-poor environments.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Scorched Earth&quot; is one of many games in the genre of &quot;turn-based artillery games&quot;. Such games are among the earliest computer games, with versions existing for mainframes with only teletype output. &quot;Scorched Earth&quot;, with a plethora of weapon types and power-ups, is considered the modern archetype of its format.

The game has a wide variety of customization options from gravity, wind, money, meteorite showers, and a similarly large pool of different payloads, allowing for a large amount of entirely different situations.

The AI players can display text messages before firing, such as &quot;I shall smash your ugly tank!&quot; and before dying, such as &quot;Join the army, see the world they said&quot;.
The weapons range from small missile rounds to MIRV warheads to high-yield nuclear weapons. All weapons can be upgraded with tracers which allow the player to more accurately adjust the trajectory on their next turn. In addition to conventional warheads, there is also ordnance such as napalm, wildly bouncing bombs, and earth weapons - allowing the player to dump dirt on other tanks or to remove ground from beneath them. A tank which is covered with dirt has to shoot itself free and may get damaged in the process; one which falls from too high a level may be destroyed. A variety of utilities, such as deflector shields, recharge batteries, and tank parachutes, make it much harder to score a kill with a single hit even with the more bizarre and advanced weapons, adding another dimension to the game&#x27;s tactics.

Projectiles can be manipulated in their flight-path by wind, shields and guidance systems, and sometimes have partially random effects. Walls may have a bouncing effect, wrap-around, or no effect, as may the ceiling. As the player advances in the game, they can afford more and more powerful weapons, as can their opponents.

The game can be played against up to nine other human players and/or computer-controlled ones. A broad range of differently skilled player types is available. If the player-controlled tanks are destroyed before the others, the AI-controlled players continue to battle each other, turning Scorched Earth into a zero-player game.

==History==
The earliest version is 1.0b. Public versions include 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.5, which was released in 1995.

Although 1.0B looks graphically similar to the later versions, in-game, its menus are completely different. It is not as feature-rich and contains some different AI class names, such as &quot;Rifleman&quot; and &quot;Twanger&quot; (which may have been changed, as they are also AI class names in the slightly earlier artillery game &quot;Tank Wars&quot;).

Starting with 1.0 in 1991, the game became shareware and is graphically what became &quot;Scorched Earth&quot;.

In version 1.1, more weapons were added, such as Napalm, Smoke Tracers, and Liquid Dirt as well as Joystick support and two new death animations among other things. Also in 1.1, a modem icon was added with the intention of including some form of net play in a following version, however, this feature was never implemented.

Nearly one year later, in 1992, version 1.2 was released which includes a new death animation and Synchronous firing mode. The final version of 1.50 was released in 1995. In 1.5, the registration feature was removed and instead, only a shareware version was released freely while the registered version could be obtained through a mail order only. Purchasing the registered version allowed the player to use the triple-turreted tank as well as removing the shareware reminders. New to this version were lasers, SuperMags, and some scenery.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1993 called &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; &quot;the most configurable artillery game I have come across ... the most playable and addictive&quot;, with &quot;quite good&quot; SVGA graphics. The magazine concluded that the game was &quot;a bargain for its modest&quot; $10 price.

In 2008, Mark J. P. Wolf said in his book &quot;The Video Game Explosion&quot; that this is &quot;probably one of the best loved PC shareware games&quot;, as a popular early multiplayer &quot;hot seat&quot; game.

==Legacy==
In a 2005 interview, Wendell Hicken said that he was talking to several publishers about developing a new official sequel. Numerous artillery games that were inspired by &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; include &quot;Atomic Tanks&quot;, &quot;Charred Dirt&quot;, &quot;Nasty Armoured Tanks of War&quot;, &quot;xscorch&quot;, &quot;Blast Doors&quot;, and &quot;Scorched 3D&quot;.

<text>Pinking shears are scissors with saw-toothed blades instead of straight blades. They produce a zigzag pattern instead of a straight edge. 

Before pinking scissors were invented, a pinking punch or pinking iron was used to punch out a decorative hem on a garment. The punch would be hammered by a mallet against a hard surface and the punch would cut through the fabric. In 1874, Eliza P. Welch patented an improved design for a pinking iron, which featured a pair of handles.
The pinking shears design that is most well known was patented by Louise Austin in 1893. In 1934, Samuel Briskman patented a pinking shear design (Felix Wyner and Edward Schulz are listed as the inventors). In 1952, Benjamin Luscalzo was granted a patent for pinking shears that would keep the blades aligned to prevent wear. 

Pinking shears are used for cutting woven cloth. Cloth edges that are unfinished will easily fray, the weave becoming undone and threads pulling out easily. The sawtooth pattern does not prevent the fraying but limits the length of the frayed thread and thus minimizes damage.

These scissors can also be used for decorative cuts and a number of patterns (arches, sawtooth of different aspect ratios, or asymmetric teeth) are available.

== Etymology ==
The cut produced by pinking shears may have been derived from the garden plant called the pink, in the genus &quot;Dianthus&quot; (the carnations). The color pink also may have been named after these flowers, although the origins of the name are not definitively known. As the pink has scalloped, or &quot;pinked&quot;, edges to its petals, pinking shears can be thought to produce an edge similar to the flower. 

The verb &quot;&quot; dates back to 1300 meaning &quot;pierce, stab, make holes in&quot;.

<doc id="233460" wikidata="Q586636" url="?curid=233460" title="Nagra">
<text>Nagra is a brand of portable audio recorders produced from 1951 in Switzerland. Beginning in 1997 a range of high-end equipment aimed at the audiophile community was introduced, and Nagra expanded the company&#x27;s product lines into new markets.

Originally a product of the Kudelski Group, Nagra recorders are now developed, produced and sold by independently owned company &quot;Audio Technology Switzerland S.A.&quot;, based in Romanel-sur-Lausanne.

== History ==
The machines were initially designed by Polish inventor Stefan Kudelski, and his company won numerous technical awards for their precision and reliability. Nagra means &quot;[it will] record&quot; in Polish, Kudelski&#x27;s native language.

Nagra-brand tape recorders were the &quot;de facto&quot; standard sound recording systems for motion picture and (non-video) single-camera television production from the 1960s until the 1990s.

==Synchronization==
Originally, a physical sync lead tethered the Nagra recorder to the camera (putting a pulse from the camera onto the tape), to ensure any fluctuations in the tape were accounted for. After the introduction of crystal sync, the tape recorder could operate separately from the camera, each having a separate accurate clock guaranteed to stay in sync with the other, allowing the sound recordist significantly more freedom of movement. This was commonly known as double system sound.

== Models ==
Nagra recorders are identified by a number that indicates their technological generation and features:
*NAGRA I – The very first prototype with clockwork motor and miniature tubes, appearing in 1951. Two were sold to Radio Genève.
*NAGRA II – The first production model, miniature tubes equipped, clockwork motor, which appeared in 1953. In 1953, in a new facility, Nagra began the production of the Nagra II, a Nagra I with the option to have an external modulometer (a type of VU meter) in the sidewall. Later the Nagra II was improved to the Nagra II b and in 1955, to the Nagra II c (a Nagra II with some improvements in electronics and using the first Nagra printed circuit).
*NAGRA II CI – The second generation fitted with printed circuit boards replacing chassis wiring, appearing in 1955.
*Nagra III NP – The first Nagra usable for film work, appearing in 1958. This was a monaural recorder, with the &quot;NP&quot; denoting the Neopilot sync.
*Nagra IV-L – Monaural, Neopilot sync, featuring two microphone inputs and a built-in audio limiter. Introduced in 1968. The unreliable head mounts were redesigned three times with the final design being designated the Nagra 4.2
*Nagra 4.2 – Same as the IV-L, but added powering for microphones and built-in equalizers. Introduced in 1972. In the 1980s one could upgrade a 4.2 to record SMPTE timecode.

*Nagra IV-S – Stereo Nagra, recording two-track stereo. It had dual level pots, limiters, and equalizer presets. It was introduced in 1971. It originally employed a 14 kHz sync signal that is not compatible with the earlier Neopilot sync. This signal is recorded employing FM modulation on a third or center track that could simultaneously be employed as an additional but lower quality &quot;cue&quot; track.
*Nagra IV-STC – In 1984 Nagra introduced timecode support. With such support an IV-S became an STC with a pull out tray.

*Nagra IV-SJ – Stereo Nagra for instrumentation and logging. Pots are replaced with switches to set gain in precise steps, no limiters, and when present, the microphone inputs are for high-voltage unbalanced instrumentation mics rather than low impedance balanced with T-power and phantom.
*Nagra IS – In 1974 the Nagra IS (nicknamed Idioten-Sicher or &quot;idiot proof&quot; by its users) was introduced. The Nagra IS was a small-bodied recorder, to be used in both film- and broadcast applications. Focus was on simple operation and lower weight than the IV/4-series recorders. It only supported 5 inch reels. Special versions of the IS called ISN and ISS could play back the 3,81 mm wide tape used with Nagra SN recorders. The IS is the only model derived from the original Nagra III to use three motors for tape transport. Supply and take up spools have their own motors.
*NAGRA E – A simple, single-speed (7.5ips), mono recorder aimed at radio reporters was introduced in 1976.
In addition to these field recorders, Kudelski S.A. produced a studio recorder called the Nagra T-Audio, designed mainly for use in telecines for transferring dailies. All of the above machines use 1/4&quot; tape.

*NAGRA TRVR – A rare stereo machine designed with the 19&quot; rack format. It is a reel to reel 1/4&quot; tape recorder designed for automatic long recording using the four standard tape speeds. The machine is equipped with an automatic start recording device actuated by the input signal and, at the tape end, allows automatic connection to another machine that begins recording on a new tape without loss of signal. When equipped with the accessory RCHS, Time Code Reader Searcher, the machine allows high speed search of a particular sequence when its time code had been entered by the keyboard or from its memory. These machines were used by intelligence services of several countries and logging service of radio stations.

=== &quot;Série Noire&quot; ===
Kudelski SA also produced a series of miniaturised reel-to-reel recorders using a special tape (width ), slightly larger than the conventional 1/8&quot; cassette tape. These machines are referred to as SN (for Série Noire) and production was originally ordered by President Kennedy for the United States Secret Service.

The SN range comprises the following models:
*Nagra SNN – monaural, full-track, main tape speed of 3-3/4 ips.
*Nagra SNS – monaural, half-track, main tape speed of 15/16 ips (multiplying the recording length at the expense of the dynamic range and high-frequency response).
*Nagra SNST – stereo, intended more for security service &quot;two microphones to record two different people talking&quot; usage than hi-fi usage due to technical limitations.
*Nagra SNST-R – full hi-fi stereo.

A special version of the SN using unique tape cassettes was made in cooperation with JBR Technology and widely used by US domestic intelligence agencies.

=== Digital recorders ===
The Nagra IV-STC was the standard for film and classical music recording until the mid-1990s, when DAT recorders became reliable enough to use in the field. In response, Kudelski produced two digital recorders to compete:
*Nagra D – 4 channel PCM digital audio recorder. Instead of recording to the DAT format, the D used a digital reel-to-reel format using a helical scan head and 1/4&quot; tape on 5&quot; and 7&quot; reels. The tape is identical to that used on Digital Audio Stationary Head machines such as the Sony PCM-3202 and Mitsubishi X-86 series. The unique format, combined with its heavy weight, made it somewhat unpopular with many production sound mixers, but year after year many films were completed with Nagra Ds (and the newer 24-bit/96 kHz Nagra DII). Despite some popularity in the late 1990s, the Nagra D and DII are a rarity on US films as of the mid-2000s.
*Nagra ARES C and ARES- PP – In 1995 the ARES-C recorder was introduced with the aim of replacing the ageing NAGRA-E portable tape recorder in the broadcast market. Based on a tape-less platform using PCMCIA computer memory cards as a recording medium, the ARES-C offers a recorder, editor and ISDN codec in the same portable, battery operated box. Accepted by radio stations around the world it formed the basis of a new generation of digital recorders for the NAGRA company. After the success of NAGRA D digital tape recorder, the NAGRA ARES was the first NAGRA digital tape-less recorder. The ARES C-PP was a studio 19&quot; (2U) rack-mountable version of the ARES-C and gave broadcasters a full system for journalistic transmission. The C-PP was extensively used in broadcast OB vans and small radio studios. Nagra ARES models use PC (formerly PCMCIA) Cards for data storage, Flash RAM Type I and II (max 192 MB).
*Nagra V – 2 channel PCM digital audio recorder, 24-bit/96 kHz, removable hard drive based recorder with timecode support. Has the additional benefits of being very light, and producing files easily processed by non-linear editing systems. Originally released with the Orb removable hard drive system, which proved unreliable. The drive system was replaced by Agate Technology&#x27;s DN-Boy system in October 2002. Unlike the analog Nagras, the Nagra V digital recorders have not been adopted as readily for the motion picture and TV industries, which mostly use competing digital multi-track machines from manufacturers such as Aaton&#x27;s Cantar, Fostex, Sound Devices and Zaxcom.
*Nagra VI – Released in 2008, originally as a 6 channel recorder and later upgraded to 8 channels (six inputs plus two mix), the Nagra VI was touted as &quot;the natural successor to the NAGRA-D / DII multi-track digital recorders&quot; and is equipped with four microphone preamps, two line level inputs which double as dual digital inputs (AES/EBU and S/PDIF), with input channels equipped with low pass filters, limiters, variable mic sensitivity settings and variable voltage phantom power. Rotary encoders and soft buttons allow the user to program the function of the main audio pots and shortcut keys. The VI records to an internal 2.5&quot; hard drive with compact flash as a backup or for transfers, has full timecode capability and meta-data entry for audio files and digital sound reports. Records 24-bit/96 kHz as well as MP3 formats. The VI was released to compete with multitrack machines from other manufacturers, although it has still not regained its original market share in production sound, as higher channel counts and smaller size and weight become more available at less cost.
*Nagra Seven – Since 2013, this 2 track recorder has been designed as the successor to the Nagra LB, ARES-C, ARES-BB+ and Nagra V recorders. It is a flexible device and can be adapted to a multitude of specific applications depending on the internal options installed. Based on an extremely high performance, simple to operate platform the addition internal ISDN or SMPTE/EBU time code boards adapt it to either the broadcast or film / TV markets. Optional WiFi/3G, WiFi/4G, internal editor and audio compressions are also available, to further dedicate the device for particular applications.

== Hi-fi ==

In 1997, Nagra launched the PL-P, a vacuum tube phono preamplifier, beginning a range of high-end audio equipment. The range is intended for audiophile consumers as opposed to exclusively the professional equipment manufactured hitherto. Since then, the range has grown steadily and have added tubes and mosfet amplifiers, CD players, other pre-amps and DACs.

== Appearances in Films ==

Nagra audio recorders have made appearances in numerous films, including:

* &quot;Klute&quot; (1971) – Nagra SN
* &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971) – Nagra III
* &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974) – Nagra SN
* &quot;Diva&quot; (1981) – Nagra IV-S, a recording made by the machine is a central to the film&#x27;s plot.
* &quot;Blow Out&quot; (1981) – Nagra III and Nagra SN
* &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; (1988) – Nagra III
* &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1990) – Nagra III
* &quot;Sneakers&quot; (1992) – Nagra III
* Voci notturne (ep. 2, 1995) – Nagra 4.2
* &quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001) – Nagra IV and Nagra SN 
* &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004) – Nagra 4.2
* &quot;The Informant!&quot; (2009) – Nagra SNST behind opening credits and prominent throughout film

==In music==
Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel and others recorded the rhythm track to the Simon and Garfunkel song Cecilia on a Nagra recorder which was unintentionally creating the echo effect on the recording as they banged on a guitar case, piano bench and their legs.

The Nagra IV-S was also used in the recording of the following albums:
* The Beatles &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970)
* Pink Floyd &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973)
* David Bowie &quot;Heroes&quot; (1977)
* Led Zeppelin &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; (1979)
* Michael Jackson &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982)
* AC/DC &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; (1988)

<text>A zero-player game or no-player game is a simulation game that has no sentient players. 

== Types ==
There are various different types of games that can be considered &quot;zero-player&quot;.

=== Determined by initial state ===
A game that evolves as determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from humans is considered a zero-player game. 

Cellular automaton games that are determined by initial conditions including Conway&#x27;s Game of Life are examples of this.&quot;&quot; 

&quot;Progress Quest&quot; is another example, in the game the player sets up an artificial character, and afterwards the game plays itself with no further input from the player. &quot;Godville&quot; is a similar game that took inspiration from &quot;Progress Quest&quot;. In the game, the player is a god that can communicate with a non-player character hero. However, the game can progress with no interaction from the player.

Incremental games, sometimes called idle games or clicker games, are games which do require some player intervention near the beginning however may be zero-player at higher levels. As an example, &quot;Cookie Clicker&quot; requires that players click cookies manually before purchasing assets to click cookies in the place of the player independently.

===AI vs AI games===
In computer games, the term refers to programs that use artificial intelligence rather than human players, for example some fighting and real-time strategy games can be put into zero-player mode where multiple AIs can play against each other. Humans may have a challenge in designing the AI and giving it sufficient skill to play the game well, but the actual evolution of the game has no human intervention.

<text>The New York Public Library (NYPL) is a public library system in New York City. With nearly 53 million items and 92 locations, the New York Public Library is the second-largest public library in the United States behind the Library of Congress and the fifth-largest public library in the world. It is a private, non-governmental, independently managed, nonprofit corporation operating with both private and public financing.

The library has branches in the boroughs of the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island and affiliations with academic and professional libraries in the New York metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s other two boroughs, Brooklyn and Queens, are not served by the New York Public Library system, but rather by their respective borough library systems: the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Public Library. The branch libraries are open to the general public and consist of circulating libraries. The New York Public Library also has four research libraries, which are also open to the general public.

The library, officially chartered as The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations, was developed in the 19th century, founded from an amalgamation of grass-roots libraries and social libraries of bibliophiles and the wealthy, aided by the philanthropy of the wealthiest Americans of their age.

The &quot;New York Public Library&quot; name may also refer to its Main Branch, which is easily recognizable by its lion statues named Patience and Fortitude that sit either side of the entrance. The branch was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and designated a New York City Landmark in 1967.

==History==

At the behest of Joseph Cogswell, John Jacob Astor placed a codicil in his will to bequeath $400,000 (equivalent of $ million in 2024) for the creation of a public library. After Astor&#x27;s death in 1848, the resulting board of trustees executed the will&#x27;s conditions and constructed the Astor Library in 1854 in the East Village.

The library created was a free reference library; its books were not permitted to circulate. By 1872, the Astor Library was described in a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial as a &quot;major reference and research resource&quot;, but, &quot;Popular it certainly is not, and, so greatly is it lacking in the essentials of a public library, that its stores might almost as well be under lock and key, for any access the masses of the people can get thereto&quot;.

An act of the New York State Legislature incorporated the Lenox Library in 1870. The library was built on Fifth Avenue, between 70th and 71st Streets, in 1877. Bibliophile and philanthropist James Lenox donated a vast collection of his Americana, art works, manuscripts, and rare books, including the first Gutenberg Bible in the New World. At its inception, the library charged admission and did not permit physical access to any literary items.

Former Governor of New York and presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden believed that a library with citywide reach was required, and upon his death in 1886, he bequeathed the bulk of his fortune—about (equivalent of $ million in 2024)—to &quot;establish and maintain a free library and reading room in the city of New York&quot;. This money would sit untouched in a trust for several years, until John Bigelow, a New York attorney, and Andrew Haswell Green, both trustees of the Tilden fortune, came up with an idea to merge two of the city&#x27;s largest libraries.

Both the Astor and Lenox libraries were struggling financially. Although New York City already had numerous libraries in the 19th century, almost all of them were privately funded and many charged admission or usage fees (a notable exception was Cooper Union, which opened its free reading room to the public in 1859). Bigelow, the most prominent supporter of the plan to merge the two libraries found support in Lewis Cass Ledyard, a member of the Tilden Board, as well as John Cadwalader, on the Astor board. Eventually, John Stewart Kennedy, president of the Lenox board, also came to support the plan.

On May 23, 1895, Bigelow, Cadwalader, and George L. Rives agreed to create &quot;The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations&quot;. The plan was hailed as an example of private philanthropy for the public good. On December 11, John Shaw Billings was named as the library&#x27;s first director. The newly established library consolidated with the grass-roots New York Free Circulating Library in February 1901.

In March, Andrew Carnegie tentatively agreed to donate (equivalent of $ million in 2024) to construct sixty-five branch libraries in the city, with the requirement that they be operated and maintained by the City of New York. The Brooklyn and Queens public library systems, which predated the consolidation of New York City, eschewed the grants offered to them and did not join the NYPL system; they believed that they would not get treatment equal to the Manhattan and the Bronx counterparts.

Later, in 1901, Carnegie formally signed a contract with the City of New York to transfer his donation to the city in order to enable it to justify purchasing the land for building the branch libraries. The NYPL Board of trustees hired consultants for the planning, and accepted their recommendation that a limited number of architectural firms be hired to build the Carnegie libraries; this would ensure uniformity of appearance and minimize cost. The trustees hired McKim, Mead &amp; White, Carrère and Hastings, and Walter Cook to design all the branch libraries.

New York author Washington Irving was a close friend of Astor for decades and had helped the philanthropist design the Astor Library. Irving served as President of the library&#x27;s Board of Trustees from 1848 until his death in 1859, shaping the library&#x27;s collecting policies with his strong sensibility regarding European intellectual life. Subsequently, the library hired nationally prominent experts to guide its collections policies; they reported directly to directors John Shaw Billings (who also developed the National Library of Medicine), Edwin H. Anderson, Harry M. Lydenberg, Franklin F. Hopper, Ralph A. Beals, and Edward Freehafer (1954–1970). They emphasized expertise, objectivity, and a very broad worldwide range of knowledge in acquiring, preserving, organizing, and making available to the general population nearly 12 million books and 26.5 million additional items. The directors in turn reported to an elite board of trustees, chiefly elderly, well-educated, philanthropic, predominantly Protestant, upper-class white men with commanding positions in American society. They saw their role as protecting the library&#x27;s autonomy from politicians as well as bestowing upon it status, resources, and prudent care.

Representative of many major board decisions was the purchase in 1931 of the private library of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich (1847–1909), uncle of the last tsar. This was one of the largest acquisitions of Russian books and photographic materials; at the time, the Soviet government had a policy of selling its cultural collections abroad for gold. Related collections include a significant number of important works by Russian photographers, and photographs related to the House of Romanov and Russia expert George Kennan.

The military drew extensively from the library&#x27;s map and book collections in the world wars, including hiring its staff. For example, the Map Division&#x27;s chief Walter Ristow was appointed as head of the geography section of the War Department&#x27;s New York Office of Military Intelligence from 1942 to 1945. Ristow and his staff discovered, copied, and loaned thousands of strategic, rare or unique maps to war agencies in need of information not available through other sources.

===Research libraries===
====Main branch building====
The organizers of the New York Public Library, wanting an imposing main branch, chose a central site along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 42nd Streets, on top of the Croton Reservoir. John Shaw Billings, the first director of the library, created an initial design that became the basis of the new building containing a huge reading room on top of seven floors of book stacks, combined with a system that was designed to get books into the hands of library users as fast as possible. The architectural firm Carrère and Hastings constructed the structure in the Beaux-Arts style, and the structure opened on May 23, 1911. It was the largest marble structure up to that time in the United States.

The two stone lions guarding the entrance were sculpted by E.C. Potter and carved by the Piccirilli Brothers. Its main reading room was contemporaneously the largest of its kind in the world at wide by long, with ceilings.

An expansion in the 1970s and 1980s added storage space under Bryant Park, directly west of the library. The structure was given a major restoration from 2007 to 2011, underwritten by a $100 million gift from philanthropist Stephen A. Schwarzman, for whom the branch was subsequently renamed. Today, the branch&#x27;s main reading room is equipped with computers with access to library collections and the Internet as well as docking facilities for laptops. A Fellows program makes reserved rooms available for writers and scholars, selected annually, and many have accomplished important research and writing at the library.

The Main Branch also contains several historic designations. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and designated a New York City designated landmark in 1967. Astor Hall, first-to-third-floor stairs, and McGraw Rotunda were designated as interior landmarks in 1974. and the Rose Main Reading Room and Public Catalog Room were separately made New York City designated landmarks in 2017.

====Other research branches====

In the 1990s, the New York Public Library decided to relocate that portion of the research collection devoted to science, technology, and business to a new location. The library purchased and adapted the former B. Altman &amp; Company Building on 34th Street. In 1995, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the library, the Science, Industry and Business Library (SIBL), designed by Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates of Manhattan, opened to the public. Upon the creation of the SIBL, the central research library on 42nd Street was renamed the Humanities and Social Sciences Library.

Today there are four research libraries that comprise the NYPL&#x27;s research library system; together they hold approximately 44 million items. Total item holdings, including the collections of the Branch Libraries, are . The Humanities and Social Sciences Library on 42nd Street is still the heart of the NYPL&#x27;s research library system. The SIBL, with approximately volumes and 60,000 periodicals, is the nation&#x27;s largest public library devoted solely to science and business. The NYPL&#x27;s two other research libraries are the Schomburg Center for Research and Black Culture, located at 135th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem, and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, located at Lincoln Center. In addition to their reference collections, the Library for the Performing Arts and the SIBL also have circulating components that are administered as ordinary branch libraries.

===Recent history===

The New York Public Library was not created by government statute. From its earliest days, the library was formed from a partnership of city government with private philanthropy. As of 2010, the research libraries in the system are largely funded with private money, and the branch or circulating libraries are financed primarily with city government funds. Until 2009, the research and branch libraries operated almost entirely as separate systems, but that year various operations were merged. By early 2010, the NYPL staff had been reduced by about 16 percent, in part through the consolidations.

In 2010, as part of the consolidation program, the NYPL moved various back-office operations to a new Library Services Center building in Long Island City. A former warehouse was renovated for this purpose for . In the basement, a new, book sorter uses bar codes on library items to sort them for delivery to 132 branch libraries. At two-thirds the length of a football field, the machine is the largest of its kind in the world, according to library officials. Books located in one branch and requested from another go through the sorter, the use of which has cut waiting times by at least a day. Together with 14 library employees, the machine can sort 7,500 items an hour (or 125 a minute). On the first floor of the Library Services Center is an ordering and cataloging office; on the second, the digital imaging department (formerly at the Main Branch building) and the manuscripts and archives division, where the air is kept cooler; on the third, the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Division, with a staff of 10 (as of 2010) but designed for as many as 30 employees.

The NYPL maintains a force of NYC special patrolmen, who provide security and protection to various libraries, and NYPL special investigators, who oversee security operations at the library facilities. These officials have on-duty arrest authority granted by the New York Penal Law. Some library branches contract for security guards.

In 2014 NYPL launched a project called &quot;Library Simplified&quot;, to address the difficulties that patrons were having checking out e-books, especially compared to the process for buying them. By 2016 the project had produced an app called &quot;SimplyE&quot;, which the library launched that year; patrons could explore and check-out ebooks from multiple vendors, with just a few clicks. The library released the code for SimplyE open source. 

To celebrate its 125th anniversary in 2020, the NYPL calculated a list of its most checked out books. Topping the list was Ezra Jack Keats&#x27; &quot;The Snowy Day&quot;, with &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; rounding out the top three.

Until 2021, the NYPL charged a late fee of $0.25 per day per book; other types of items had different late fees, and seniors and disabled patrons paid lower late fees. The library system&#x27;s president, Anthony Marx, indicated his intention to eliminate late fees after assuming the library&#x27;s presidency in 2011. The NYPL stopped charging late fees on October 5, 2021. Existing debts have since been cleared from the records of all NYPL patrons.

On November 26, 2023, Sunday services were discontinued at select branches where it was offered; along with reduced programs for adults and children. This followed months of contentious budget negotiations between the City Council and Mayor Eric Adams, with Adams claiming that the New York City migrant housing crisis necessitated the budget cuts. The $12.6 million in city spending for the NYPL represents 0.02% of the city&#x27;s 2024 budget of $110 billion. Funding for Sunday service was restored in June 2024.

===BookOps===
In February 2013, the New York and Brooklyn public libraries announced that they would merge their technical services departments. The new department is called BookOps. The proposed merger anticipates a savings of $2 million for the Brooklyn Public Library and $1.5 million for the New York Public Library. Although not currently part of the merger, it is expected that the Queens Public Library will eventually share some resources with the other city libraries. As of 2011, circulation in the New York Public Library systems and Brooklyn Public Library systems has increased by 59%. Located in Long Island City, BookOps was created as a way to save money while improving patrons service. The services of BookOps include the Selection Team which &quot;acquires, describes, prepares, and delivers new items for the circulating collections of Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) and New York Public Library, and for the general collections of NYPL&#x27;s research libraries.&quot; Under the Selection Team are the Acquisitions Department, the Cataloging Department, The Collections Processing Unit, and the Logistics Department.

Before this facility opened, all the aforementioned departments were housed in different locations with no accountability between them, and items sometimes taking up to two weeks to reach their intended destination. BookOps now has all departments in one building and in 2015 sorted almost eight million items. The building has numerous rooms, including a room dedicated to caring for damaged books.

=== Controversies ===
The consolidations and changes in collections have promoted continuing debate and controversy since 2004 when David Ferriero was named the Andrew W. Mellon Director and Chief Executive of the Research Libraries. NYPL had engaged consultants Booz Allen Hamilton to survey the institution, and Ferriero endorsed the survey&#x27;s report as a big step &quot;in the process of reinventing the library&quot;. The consolidation program has resulted in the elimination of subjects such as the Asian and Middle East Division (formerly named Oriental Division), as well as the Slavic and Baltic Division.

A number of innovations in recent years have been criticized. In 2004 NYPL announced participation in the Google Books Library Project. By agreement between Google and major international libraries, selected collections of public domain books would be scanned in their entirety and made available online for free to the public. The negotiations between the two partners called for each to project guesses about ways that libraries are likely to expand in the future. According to the terms of the agreement, the data cannot be crawled or harvested by any other search engine; no downloading or redistribution is allowed. The partners and a wider community of research libraries can share the content.

The sale of the separately endowed former Donnell Library in midtown provoked controversy. The elimination of Donnell was a result of the dissolution of children&#x27;s, young adult and foreign language collections. The Donnell Media Center was also dismantled, the bulk of its collection relocated at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts as the Reserve Film and Video Collection, with parts of its collection redistributed. The site was redeveloped for a luxury hotel.

Several veteran librarians have retired, and the number of age-level specialists in the boroughs have been cut back.
== Branch libraries ==
The New York Public Library system maintains commitment as a public lending library through its branch libraries in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island, including the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library (formerly: Mid-Manhattan Library), the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, the circulating collections of the Science, Industry and Business Library, and the circulating collections of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The branch libraries comprise the third-largest library in the United States. These circulating libraries offer a wide range of collections, programs, and services, including the renowned Picture Collection at Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library and the Media Center, redistributed from Donnell.

The system has 40 libraries in Manhattan, 35 in the Bronx, and 14 in Staten Island. The newest is the Charleston Library, which opened on March 16, 2022. As of 2022, the New York Public Library consisted of 4 research centers and 89 neighborhood branch libraries in the three boroughs served. All libraries in the NYPL system may be used free of charge by all visitors.

, the research collections contain 46.8 million items (books, videotapes, maps, etc.), while the branch libraries contain 9.9 million items. Together the collections total nearly items, a number surpassed only by the Library of Congress and the British Library.

==Services==
===ASK NYPL===

Telephone Reference, known as ASK NYPL, answers 100,000 questions per year, by phone and online, as well as in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

=== Website and digital holdings ===
The Library website provides access to the library&#x27;s catalogs, online collections and subscription databases. It also has information about the library&#x27;s free events, exhibitions, computer classes and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. The two online catalogs, LEO (which searches the circulating collections) and CATNYP (which searches the research collections) allow users to search the library&#x27;s holdings of books, journals and other materials. The LEO system allows cardholders to request books from any branch and have them delivered to any branch.

The NYPL gives cardholders free access from home to thousands of current and historical magazines, newspapers, journals and reference books in subscription databases, including EBSCOhost, which contains full text of major magazines; full text of the &quot;New York Times&quot; (1995–present), Gale&#x27;s Ready Reference Shelf which includes the &quot;Encyclopedia of Associations&quot; and periodical indexes, &quot;Books in Print&quot;; and Ulrich&#x27;s Periodicals Directory. The New York Public Library also links to outside resources, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#x27; &quot;Occupational Outlook Handbook&quot;, and the CIA&#x27;s &quot;World Factbook&quot;. Databases are available for children, teenagers, and adults of all ages.

The NYPL Digital Collections (formerly named Digital Gallery) is a database of over 900,000 images digitized from the library&#x27;s collections. The Digital Collections was named one of &quot;Time Magazine&quot;″s 50 Coolest Websites of 2005 and Best Research Site of 2006 by an international panel of museum professionals.

The &quot;Photographers&#x27; Identities Catalog&quot; (PIC) is an experimental online service of the &quot;Photography Collection&quot; in the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. Other databases available only from within the library include &quot;Nature&quot;, IEEE and Wiley science journals, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; archives, and Factiva. Overall, the digital holdings for the Library consist of more than a petabyte of data as of 2015.

NYPL cardholders can download free e-books via the SimplyE app and website. As part of the Books for All program, a limited number of books in the NYPL&#x27;s collection, which have been banned elsewhere in the United States, are also available to anyone in the U.S. via the SimplyE app.

====One NYPL====
In 2006, the library adopted a new strategy that merged branch and research libraries into &quot;One NYPL&quot;. The organizational change developed a unified online catalog for all the collections, and one card to that could be used at both branch and research libraries. The 2009 website and online-catalog transition had some initial difficulties, but ultimately the catalogues were integrated.

=== Community Oral History Project ===
NYPL&#x27;s Community Oral History Project shares New York City&#x27;s neighborhoods and diverse people by documenting history through collected stories. The Oral History Project includes people living in Greenwich Village, Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood, Times Square, Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Soho, Lower East Side, Chinatown, and Kips Bay as well as Transgender, Latino Americans, Veterans, and Disability Experience.

===Community outreach===
The New York Public Library offers many services to its patrons. Some of these services include services for immigrants. New York City is known for having a welcoming environment when its comes to people of diverse backgrounds. The library offers free work and life skills classes. These are offered in conjunction with volunteers and partnerships at the library. In addition, the library offers non-English speakers materials and coaching for them to acclimate to the U.S. For these non-English speakers, the library offers free ESOL classes. An initiative was taken in July 2018, NYC library card holders are allowed to visit Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim and 31 other prominent New York cultural institutions for free.

===Temporary programs===
In June 2017, Subway Library was announced. It was an initiative between the New York Public Library, Brooklyn Public Library, Queens Public Library, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and Transit Wireless. The Subway Library gave New York City Subway riders access to e-books, excerpts, and short stories.

Like all public libraries in New York, the NYPL is granted a charter from the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and is registered with the New York State Education Department. The basic powers and duties of all library boards of trustees are defined in the Education Law and are subject to Part 90 of Title 8 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations.

The NYPL&#x27;s charter, as restated and granted in 1975, gives the name of the corporation as &quot;The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations&quot;. The library is governed by a board of trustees, composed of between 25 and 42 trustees of several classes who collectively choose their own successors, including &quot;ex officio&quot; the New York City Mayor, New York City Council Speaker and New York City Comptroller.

==Other New York City library systems==

The New York Public Library is one of three separate and independent public library systems in New York City. The other two library systems are the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Public Library. According to the 2006 &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Management Report,&quot; New York City&#x27;s three public library systems had a total library circulation of 35 million: the NYPL and BPL (with 143 branches combined) had a circulation of , and the Queens system had a circulation of through its 62 branch libraries. Altogether the three library systems hosted visitors in 2006. Taken as a whole, the three library systems in the city have 209 branches with 63 million items in their collections.

Other libraries in New York City, some of which can be used by the public, are listed in the Directory of Special Libraries and Information Centers.

==Cultural impact==
The historian David McCullough has described the New York Public Library as one of the five most important libraries in the United States; the others are the Library of Congress, the Boston Public Library, and the university libraries of Harvard and Yale.

The New York Public Library was a founding member of the Research Libraries Group, alongside Columbia, Harvard, and Yale Libraries.

Along with Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton, NYPL is a member of the Research Collections and Preservation Consortium (ReCAP), and shares an off-site shelving facility in Plainsboro, New Jersey with the three Ivy League universities.

<text>Glitch is a genre of electronic music that emerged in the 1990s which is distinguished by the deliberate use of glitch-based audio media and other sonic artifacts.

The glitching sounds featured in glitch tracks usually come from audio recording device or digital electronics malfunctions, such as CD skipping, electric hum, digital or analog distortion, circuit bending, bit-rate reduction, hardware noise, software bugs, computer crashes, vinyl record hiss or scratches, and system errors. Sometimes devices that were already broken are used, and sometimes devices are broken expressly for this purpose. In &quot;Computer Music Journal&quot;, composer and writer Kim Cascone classified glitch as a subgenre of electronica and used the term &quot;post-digital&quot; to describe the glitch aesthetic.

== History ==
The origins of the glitch aesthetic can be traced to the early 20th century with Luigi Russolo&#x27;s Futurist manifesto &quot;L&#x27;arte dei rumori&quot; (The Art of Noises, the basis of noise music, published in 1913). He constructed mechanical noise generators, which he named &quot;intonarumori&quot;, and wrote multiple compositions to be played by them, including &quot;Risveglio di una città&quot; (&quot;Awakening of a City&quot;) and &quot;Convegno di automobili e aeroplani&quot; (&quot;Meeting of Automobiles and Airplanes&quot;). In 1914, a riot broke out at one of his performances in Milan, Italy. 

Later musicians and composers who made use of malfunctioning technology include the 1968 song &quot;The Best Way to Travel&quot;, by Michael Pinder of The Moody Blues, and works by Christian Marclay, who began in 1979 to use mutilated vinyl records to create sound collages. Yasunao Tone used damaged CDs in his &quot;Techno Eden&quot; performance of 1985, while 1992 album &quot;It Was a Dark and Stormy Night&quot; by Nicolas Collins included a composition featuring a string quartet playing alongside the stuttering sound of skipping CDs. Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima&#x27;s electronic soundtrack for the 1994 video game &quot;Streets of Rage 3&quot; used automatically randomized sequences to generate &quot;unexpected and odd&quot; experimental sounds.

Glitch music properly originated as a distinct movement in Germany and Japan during the 1990s, with musical works and labels (especially Mille Plateaux) of Achim Szepanski in Germany, and works of Ryoji Ikeda in Japan.

Nuno Canavarro&#x27;s album &quot;Plux Quba&quot;, released in 1988, incorporated pristine electroacoustic sounds that resembled early glitch. Oval&#x27;s album &quot;Wohnton&quot;, published in 1993, helped define the genre by adding ambient aesthetics.

The earliest uses of the term &quot;glitch&quot; as related to music include electronic duo Autechre&#x27;s song &quot;Glitch&quot;, released in 1994, and experimental electronic group ELpH&#x27;s album &quot;Worship the Glitch&quot;, published in 1995.

== Production techniques ==
In the latter half of the 20th century, the experimental music that served as the precursor to glitch contained distortions that were often produced by manual manipulation of audio media. This came in the form of Yasunao Tone&#x27;s &quot;wounded&quot; CDs; small bits of semi-transparent tape were placed on the CD to interrupt the reading of the audio information. Other examples of this manual tampering include Nicholas Collins&#x27; modification of an electric guitar to act as a resonator for electrical signals, and his adaption of a CD player to allow recordings played on it to be altered during live performance. Skipping CDs, scratched vinyl records, circuit bending, and other distortions resembling electronic noise figure prominently into the creation of rhythm and feeling in glitch; it is from the use of these digital artifacts that the genre derives its name. However, glitch today is often produced on computers using digital production software to splice together small &quot;cuts&quot; (samples) of music from previously recorded works. These cuts are then integrated with the signature of glitch music: beats made up of glitches, clicks, scratches, and otherwise erroneous-sounding noise. The glitches are often very short, and are typically used in place of traditional percussion or instrumentation. Popular software for creating glitch music includes trackers like Jeskola Buzz and Renoise, as well as modular software like Reaktor, Ableton Live, Reason, AudioMulch, Bidule, SuperCollider, FLStudio, Max/MSP, Pure Data, and ChucK. Some artists also use digital synthesizers like the Clavia Nord Modular G2 and Elektron&#x27;s Machinedrum and Monomachine.

<text>Microhouse, buftech or sometimes just minimal, is a subgenre of house music strongly influenced by minimalism and 1990s techno.

==History==
Microhouse has its roots in the minimal techno, bitpop (both developed in the early 1990s), and house (developed in the early 1980s) genres of music. Its first echoes appeared in a glitch album by German experimental artist Oval, in 1993. Like many contemporary electronic genres, Microhouse has many influences, most notably techno and the &quot;click and pop&quot; garage house that has emerged from Yorkshire Bleeps and Bass (or &quot;Bleep&quot;), bitpop and minimal techno. Contrasting with tech house, which is often thought of as &#x27;house music with elements of techno in its arrangement and instrumentation&#x27;, microhouse is more aptly described as &#x27;housey minimal techno&#x27; – a marriage of the funky and groovy backroom house elements with bitpop and the driving, repetitive sound of techno. Emphasis tended to fall on cushiony kick-drum thumps and the accompanying hi-hats, with faint textures provided by synthetic strings and dreamy keyboard tones.

Full-fledged microhouse artists start appearing in the late-90&#x27;s to early-00&#x27;s such as German producer Jan Jelinek. His contributions are notable in the genre considering works like &quot;textstar+&quot; (as Farben) and &quot;Loop-finding-jazz-records&quot;. Both works have amassed cult status and widespread acclaim with its distinctive microhouse sound. Microhouse has continued on in the late 2010&#x27;s-20&#x27;s with electronic artists like Jon Hopkins, The Field, Pantha du Prince, Rival Consoles, Matthew Herbert, Actress, Four Tet, Isolée, and many others. &quot;Vocalcity&quot; by Luomo is a hallmark album in microhouse and has been credited as one of the main works that helped popularize the genre.

Throughout the late ‘90s and early 2000s, several small labels thriving on this approach cropped up. A fair percentage of the output from already-established labels like (Isolée, ), Kompakt (Sascha Funke, M. Mayer) and (Farben) made for some of microhouse’s most thrilling moments. Other labels — such as Force Tracks (Luomo, MRI), Perlon (Ricardo Villalobos, Pantytec) and Trapez (Akufen, M.I.A.) — were virtually all-microhouse in scope.

===Coinage===
The term &quot;microhouse&quot; was coined by music journalist and DJ Philip Sherburne in a July 2001 article for the magazine &quot;The Wire&quot;. Dave Stelfox wrote in Hyperdub that the term described &quot;the spectral, hypnotic interpretation of classic Chicago grooves emerging on labels such as Perlon, Kompakt, Playhouse, Ongaku, Klang Elektronik and the Mille Plateaux family of imprints-most notably Force Tracks and Force Inc- at the turn of the millennium.&quot; 

Sherburne recalled how listening to Perlon&#x27;s &quot;Superlongevity&quot; compilation in 1999, he &quot;had the strong impression that House had been stripped down to a trifold essence: rhythm, soul and silence.&quot; For Sherburne, this was &quot;not so much House as &#x27;MicroHouse&#x27;,&quot; capturing &quot;not only the proportions of the music, but also its semi-underground status, positioned at odds with more traditional Deep House, to say nothing of the genre&#x27;s even more mainstream, megaclub fare.&quot; He traced the sound&#x27;s reductionism to &quot;Chain Reaction&#x27;s blissed out minimalism,&quot; and its &quot;punchier and groovier&quot; qualities to &quot;Matthew Herbert&#x27;s clipped, cushioned romps, and the minimalist Chicago disco pioneered by the likes of Moodymann and Theo Parrish.&quot; He traced further antecedents in &quot;the catalogues of German labels like Klang Elektronik, Playhouse and subsequently Force Tracks&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Like house and techno, microhouse is built around a 4/4 time signature. Its tempo ranges between 115 and 130 BPM. A noticeable difference between microhouse and house is the replacement of typical house kick drums, hi-hats and other drum machine samples with clicks, static, glitches, and small bits of noise, which more often than not are stretched out and last longer in drops. Microhouse artists often experiment with different forms of sampling to achieve this effect.

One characteristic feature of microhouse is the use of sampling: extremely short (&#x27;micro&#x27;) samples of the human voice, musical instruments, everyday noises and computer created wave patterns are arranged to form complex melodies (such as can be heard in Akufen&#x27;s &quot;Deck the House&quot;). Vocals in microhouse are often simplistic, nonsensical, and monotone in nature, although some artists, such as Matthew Dear, combine singing with microhouse production. This is one of the main characteristics of microhouse compared to deep house, for example, which tends to feature no vocals and also a slower tempo going to as low as 115 BPM in some songs. 

Microhouse is somewhat obscure when compared to other genres of house and techno, but several cities including Bucharest, Melbourne, Berlin, London, Paris, Montreal, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami, Detroit, and Chicago, have budding scenes, and with the minimal techno boom of the mid-2000s, is now gaining great popularity in German, French, Canadian, Italian and Spanish clubs. Mainstream tech house records and CDs will occasionally have microhouse or minimal reworks of tracks. On top of this, several tracks have become major club hits over the years, and a few others have even gained European radioplay.

The following labels generally release minimal techno, deep house or other genres but also release microhouse:
*BPitch Control
*Cadenza
*Cocoon
*Ghostly International / Spectral Sound
*Kompakt
*Macro
*Mille Plateaux
*M nus
*Traum Schallplatten
*Truesoul
*Raster-Noton

<doc id="233471" wikidata="Q598593" url="?curid=233471" title="Tech house">
<text>Tech house is a subgenre of house music that combines stylistic features of techno with house. The term &quot;tech house&quot; developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, such as &quot;rugged basslines&quot; and &quot;steely beats&quot;, with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house. The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK.

In the mid to late 1990s, a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by the former Shamen rapper Mr C (Richard West) &amp; Paul &quot;Rip&quot; Stone (co-founder with West of Plink Plonk), Heart &amp; Soul and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles. Other DJs and artists associated with the sound at that time included Charles Webster, Pure Science, Bushwacka!, Cuartero, Dave Angel, Herbert, Terry Lee Brown Jr., Funk D&#x27;Void, Ian O&#x27;Brien, Derrick Carter and Stacey Pullen. By the late 1990s, London nightclub The End, owned by Mr C and Layo Paskin, was considered the home of tech house in the UK. On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, one of the earliest innovators in the genre was Lucas Rodenbush, (E.B.E), who was releasing records on the West Coast of the United States from 1995 onwards.

==Characteristics==
As a mixing style, tech-house often brings together deep or minimal techno music, the soulful and jazzy end of house, some minimal and very often some dub elements. There is some overlap with progressive house, which too can contain deep, soulful, dub and techno elements; this is especially true since the turn of the millennium, as progressive-house mixes have themselves often become deeper and sometimes more minimal. However, the typical progressive-house mix has more energy than tech-house, which tends to have a more &quot;laid-back&quot; feel. Tech house fans tend to appreciate subtlety, as well as the &quot;middle ground&quot; that adds a &quot;splash of color to steel techno beats&quot; and eschews the &quot;banging&quot; of house music for intricate rhythms.

===Musical structure===
As a musical (as opposed to a mixing) style, tech-house uses the same basic structure as house. However, elements of the house &#x27;sound&#x27; such as realistic jazz sounds (in deep house) and booming kick drums are replaced with elements from techno such as shorter, deeper, darker and often distorted kicks, smaller, quicker hi-hats, noisier snares and more synthetic or acid sounding synth melodies from the TB-303, including raw electronic noises from distorted sawtooth and square wave oscillators.

Some producers also add soulful vocals and elements (David Chambers), and equally as much raw electronic sounds in their music. However, a rich techno-like kick and bassline seems to be a consistency amongst tech house music.

== History ==
Since the early 2000s, tech house has spread in Europe. Although it has long remained in the shadow of techno music (propelled by artists such as Adam Beyer or Richie Hawtin in northern Europe such as Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden), tech house has a huge success in Spain. Indeed, thanks to the expansion of new DJs such as Marc Maya, Oscar Aguilera or Raul Mezcolanza (all resident DJs of a box in Barcelona: the ROW14), tech house can compete with other styles of electro festivals like the Monegros Desert Festival or the Awakenings Festival. However, the highlight of tech house is also due to the promotion of this style of music by other DJs such as Carl Cox or Joris Voorn.

=== Modern resurgence ===
Tech house has become a highly popular form of dance music. As of September 2018, the Beatport top 100 is filled with tracks by artists like Green Velvet, Hot Since 82, Fisher, Solardo, MDNTMVMT, Bedouin, Patrick Topping, and Jamie Jones, all of whom incorporate elements of tech house into their work. This resurgence in tech house can be ascribed to the recent surge in popularity of analog synth sounds, as well as the popularization of tech house artists in the United States, through labels like Dirtybird and the booking of multiple tech house DJs at festivals like Coachella and CRSSD.

Fisher&#x27;s 2018 track &#x27;Losing It&#x27; is considered one of the first tech house tracks to break into mainstream popularity, as well as being credited as a major milestone in establishing the tech house sound within the realm of electronic dance music. In subsequent years, other tech house artists were able to achieve similar or even greater mainstream success, including Acraze with his 2021 track &#x27;Do It To It&#x27;, or Meduza with their 2019 tracks &#x27;Piece Of Your Heart&#x27; &amp; &#x27;Lose Control&#x27;.

<doc id="233474" wikidata="Q1447963" url="?curid=233474" title="U.S. Route 395">
<text>U.S. Route 395 (US 395), also known as U.S. Highway 395, is a north–south United States Numbered Highway that traverses the inland areas of the western states of California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. It travels for over from a junction in the Mojave Desert at Interstate 15 (I-15) in Hesperia to the Canada–U.S. border near Laurier, Washington. Major cities along its route include Carson City and Reno in Nevada; Kennewick and Pasco in Washington&#x27;s Tri-Cities region; and Spokane, Washington. US 395 is an auxiliary route of US 95 but never intersects its parent route, which runs further east.

Originally created in 1926 as a spur route of US 195, the highway was extended south from Spokane to San Diego in the 1930s. It was named the Three Flags Highway to recognize its role in linking Mexico, the United States, and Canada. US 395 was truncated to its present southern terminus at Hesperia in 1964; its former alignment to San Diego was replaced by I-15, I-215, and other highways. Other sections were moved to freeways and bypasses of various cities, including I-82 between Oregon and Washington, I-90 in Eastern Washington, and I-580 in Nevada. The highway generally follows the east side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California and Nevada and also traverses the High Desert of eastern Oregon and the Columbia Plateau in Washington.

==Route description==

US 395 is a major north–south highway serving the inland regions of the West Coast states as well as northwestern Nevada. It was named the Three Flags Highway in the 1930s to promote its role in linking Mexico, the United States, and Canada, though it never connected directly to Mexico.

===Southern California===
The southern terminus of US 395 is an interchange with Interstate 15 (I-15) in Hesperia, California, a city southwest of Victorville; I-15 continues south across the San Bernardino Mountains into the Inland Empire and towards San Diego. The highway travels north across the Mojave Desert and intersects State Route 58 (SR 58) at Kramer Junction near the town of Boron and east of Edwards Air Force Base. It continues across the desert, passing several solar farms, and crosses the El Paso Mountains and Summit Range near Johannesburg. US 395 veers northwest to bypass Ridgecrest, which is served by a business route, and merges with SR 14 near Indian Wells.

The highway travels north through the Eastern Sierra region along the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and the western boundary of Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, a large military reservation. US 395 continues through the Owens Valley and follows the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which it crosses several times; the highway is primarily four lanes in the area with several divided sections outside of cities. Around Owens Lake, US 395 intersects SR 190 and SR 136, which provide access to the west side of Death Valley National Park. The highway traverses Lone Pine and passes the Manzanar National Historic Site, which operated as a Japanese American internment center during World War II. US 395 turns north after passing through Independence and reaches Bishop, where it serves as the western terminus of US 6, a transcontinental highway.

From Bishop, US 395 turns northwest and heads closer to the Sierra Nevada foothills and serves roads that lead to ski areas and alpine towns, including Mammoth Mountain near Mammoth Lakes, June Mountain near June Lake, Dodge Ridge, and Bear Mountain. The highway ascends from the foothills into the Mono Basin and follows the western shore of Mono Lake to Lee Vining, where it is concurrent with SR 120, which traverses Yosemite National Park to the west. It then climbs Conway Summit to an elevation of , the highest point on US 395. The highway turns west in Bridgeport and north near Fales Hot Springs to follow the West Walker River downstream into Antelope Valley. US 395 then follows the west side of Topaz Lake and exits California to enter Nevada.

===Nevada===
US 395 enters Nevada at Topaz Lake and descends into Carson Valley, where it serves as a major thoroughfare and connects several major cities in the state&#x27;s western region. The highway travels northwest along the Carson River through the Washoe Tribe&#x27;s Dresslerville Colony and the adjacent towns of Gardnerville and Minden. At a junction with State Route 88 in Minden, US 395 turns due north and becomes a four-lane divided highway as it approaches Carson City, the state&#x27;s capital city. It travels around the east side of Carson City on a freeway that is shared with I-580 and US 50, which leaves near the city&#x27;s airport.

I-580 and US 395 traverse a gap in the Carson Range and travel around the west side of Washoe Lake. The freeway crosses the Steamboat Hills and meanders as it enters the southern outskirts of Reno. It then travels through the city&#x27;s suburban neighborhoods and along the west side of Reno–Tahoe International Airport before a junction with I-80 east of downtown and the University of Nevada, Reno campus. I-580 ends at the interchange, while US 395 continues on a freeway that gradually turns northwest as it leaves Reno. The freeway travels through a gap in the hills and re-enters California near the community of Cold Springs. The highway has been designated as the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway from southern Reno to the California state line since 1998.

===Northern California===

US 395 re-enters California in Eastern Sierra County and quickly enters Lassen County while generally travels northwest along the Sierra Nevada foothills. The four-lane expressway narrows to a two-lane undivided highway at Hallelujah Junction, where it intersects SR 70. The highway continues northwest to avoid Honey Lake and reaches an intersection with SR 36 near Susanville, where it turns east. US 395 travels around several mountains that dot the Modoc Plateau as it moves further away from the Sierra Nevada range and follows the Warner Mountains. The highway continues along the South Fork Pit River into the city of Alturas, where it serves as a main street until a junction with SR 299. US 395 and SR 299 travel concurrently and split northeast of Alturas in the foothills of the Warner Mountains. US 395 continues north along the shore of Goose Lake and reaches the Oregon state line in the community of New Pine Creek.

===Oregon===

US 395 enters Oregon at New Pine Creek, then heads north to Lakeview. At Lakeview, it overlaps Oregon Route 140 (OR 140) for , then continues north to Valley Falls. At Valley Falls, it turns northeast through Wagontire to Riley. Near Riley, US 395 overlaps US 20 through Hines and Burns. Approximately northeast of Burns, US 395 turns north through Seneca and Canyon City to John Day. At John Day, it overlaps US 26 and heads west to Mount Vernon. At Mount Vernon, US 395 turns north through Long Creek and Pilot Rock to Pendleton. At Pendleton, it overlaps I-84 and US 30 west to Stanfield. At Stanfield, US 395 turns north through Hermiston to Umatilla. East of Umatilla, it overlaps US 730 and heads west to I-82. It then overlaps I-82 to the Washington state line at the Columbia River.

The entire route within Oregon was designated as the World War I Veterans Memorial Highway in 2015.
===Washington===
US 395 enters Washington with I-82 on the Umatilla Bridge, which crosses the Columbia River near Plymouth. The freeway travels into the Tri-Cities area, where US 395 splits from I-82 to travel through Kennewick on city streets. The highway merges with State Route 240 (SR 240), a regional freeway, as it crosses the Columbia River on the Blue Bridge (officially the Pioneer Memorial Bridge). US 395 travels west of downtown Pasco on a short freeway and reaches a junction with I-182 and US 12, which it joins for . The highway leaves Pasco and its concurrency with I-182 and US 12 and turns north into the rural Columbia Plateau.

The four-lane divided highway carries US 395 northeast around several small towns towards Ritzville, where it merges with I-90 and begins a concurrency. The freeway is joined by US 2 and intersects US 195 in the outskirts of Spokane. In downtown Spokane, US 2 and US 395 leave I-90 and travel north on Division Street, which is split into a pair of one-way streets.

US 395 currently runs north on Division Street to travel through Spokane. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is constructing the North Spokane Corridor, a new freeway that will run from I-90 (around the Thor/Freya exit) northward to the existing US 395 north of Wandermere. Construction on the new freeway began in 2003 and is scheduled to be completed in 2030; once complete, US 395 is planned to move to the new alignment while US 2 will stay on Division Street.

US 395 (along with US 2) proceeds north through Spokane as Division Street to the north edge of the city where they split; US 2 heading northeast to Idaho. US 395 then proceeds north through the towns of Deer Park, Clayton, Chewelah, Colville and Kettle Falls. It terminates at the Canada–US border where it meets British Columbia Highway 395.

==History==

===California===
From 1934 to 1969, the southern terminus of US 395 was in downtown San Diego at US 101 (Harbor Drive) and Market Street. US 395 remained mostly intact during a highway renumbering in 1964, but was truncated to its present-day southern terminus in Hesperia by 1969. It was replaced by SR 163 from downtown San Diego to Miramar, where it was then replaced by modern-day I-15. US 395 had previously followed Park Blvd, El Cajon Blvd, and Murphy Canyon Rd through San Diego to Miramar prior to the construction of the Cabrillo Freeway through Balboa Park. It had also followed Pomerado Rd through Poway prior to the construction of the freeway, and entered Escondido along Centre City Parkway, which today exists as a business route. From Escondido, there were two alignments that existed at different times. The original route followed Mission Road and Santa Fe Avenue into Vista (the old alignment of SR 78), then continued along Santa Fe Avenue, Vista Way. US 395 then followed SR 76 briefly before splitting off along Mission Road to Fallbrook, and continued along this road out of Fallbrook. The newer route continued north more directly from Escondido, paralleling I-15 along several frontage roads (some sections of which are named &quot;Old Highway 395&quot;) to bypass Vista and Fallbrook. Where the old and new routes met near Rainbow, US 395 then proceeded north near I-15 into Temecula. From Murietta to Perris, there were two routes. The old route followed I-15 (which was SR 71 at the time) to Lake Elsinore, where it then turned along SR 74 to Perris. The new route followed I-215 from Murietta through Menifee to Perris. From Perris, US 395 was replaced by I-215 through Moreno Valley, Riverside, and San Bernardino to Devore. Through the Cajon Pass, I-15 replaced US 395 up to its present-day southern terminus at I-15 in Hesperia (Exit 141).

The state legislature passed a resolution in 2008 to recognize portions of Historic US 395; by 2011, over 100 signs had been installed by private groups along the former alignment, mostly in San Diego County.

During the 1950s, several sections of the highway were rebuilt or realigned by the California Division of Highways. Work to rebuild other two-lane sections has continued into the 21st century, with a bypass of Olancha near Owens Lake planned to be constructed in the 2020s.

Between 1992 and 2004, the section of US 395 between I-15 and Ridgecrest had over 2,000 collisions that injured 1,500 people and killed 150. The highway&#x27;s lack of shoulders, blind hills, and high speeds were cited as reasons for the frequency of collisions.

===Oregon and Washington===
US 395 was originally created in 1926 as a spur of US 195 between Spokane and the Canadian border. As a result, it never intersected its parent, US 95; US 195 always provided the connection. US 395 developed into a parallel of its parent route when it was extended south through Oregon in 1935. In Oregon, it replaced most of Oregon Route 11. The Washington section followed the northernmost section of the Inland Empire Highway, a state road that was developed in the 1910s.

Originally, US 395 didn&#x27;t travel concurrently with I-82, or I-84. US 395 went north from Pendleton to Cold Springs Junction, currently Oregon Route 37. From there, US 395 traveled concurrently with US 730 and US 410 (until US 410 became US 12), passing through Wallula to enter Pasco from the southeast. The concurrency with I-84 and rerouting through Hermiston was made in 1972. The overlap with I-82 and rerouting through Kennewick was made in 1984. Also noteworthy, the US 395 route north of Pasco at Eltopia to Connell was relocated in 1980 from what is now known as Blanton Road, to a route further west that offered greater expansion into a divided 4-lane highway. Today, the entire route of US 395 from Pasco to Ritzville, WA is four lane divided, but still with farm road crossings in places.

<doc id="233475" wikidata="Q223847" url="?curid=233475" title="Multi-party system">
<text>In political science, a multi-party system is a political system where more than two meaningfully-distinct political parties regularly run for office and win elections. Multi-party systems tend to be more common in countries using proportional representation compared to those using winner-take-all elections, a result known as Duverger&#x27;s law.

In these countries, usually no single party has a parliamentary majority by itself (hung parliaments). Instead, multiple political parties must negotiate to form a coalition with a majority of the vote, in order to make substantial changes.

== Comparisons with other party systems ==
Unlike a one-party system (or a dominant-party system), a multi-party system encourages the general constituency to form multiple distinct, officially recognized groups, generally called political parties. Each party competes for votes from the enfranchised constituents (those allowed to vote). A multi-party system prevents the leadership of a single party from controlling a single legislative chamber without challenge.

A system where only two parties have a realistic possibility of winning an election is called a two-party system. A system where only three parties have a &quot;realistic possibility&quot; of winning an election or forming a coalition is sometimes called a &quot;third-party system&quot;. 

A two-party system requires voters to align themselves in large blocks, sometimes so large that they cannot agree on any overarching principles. Some theories argue that this allows centrists to gain control, though this is disputed. On the other hand, if there are multiple major parties, each with less than a majority of the vote, the parties are strongly motivated to work together to form working governments. This also promotes centrism, as well as promoting coalition-building skills while discouraging polarization.

== By country ==
Argentina, Armenia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey and Ukraine are examples of countries with multi-party systems.

<doc id="233478" wikidata="Q908923" url="?curid=233478" title="Jackalope">
<text>The jackalope is a mythical animal of North American folklore described as a jackrabbit with antelope horns. The word &quot;jackalope&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;jackrabbit&quot; and &quot;antelope&quot;. Many jackalope taxidermy mounts, including the original, are made with deer antlers.

In the 1930s, Douglas Herrick and his brother, hunters with taxidermy skills, popularized the American jackalope by grafting deer antlers onto a jackrabbit carcass and selling the combination to a local hotel in Douglas, Wyoming. Thereafter, they made and sold many similar jackalopes to a retail outlet in South Dakota, and other taxidermists continue to manufacture the horned rabbits into the 21st century. Stuffed and mounted, jackalopes are found in many bars and other places in the United States; stores catering to tourists sell jackalope postcards and other paraphernalia, and commercial entities in America and elsewhere have used the word &quot;jackalope&quot; or a jackalope logo as part of their marketing strategies. The jackalope has appeared in published stories, poems, television shows, video games, and a low-budget mockumentary film. The Wyoming Legislature has considered bills to make the jackalope the state&#x27;s official mythological creature.

The underlying legend of the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, may be related to similar stories in other cultures and other historical times. Researchers suggest that at least some of the tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the &quot;Shope papilloma virus&quot;. It causes horn- and antler-like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit&#x27;s head and body.

Folklorists see the jackalope as one of a group of tall tale animals, known as fearsome critters, common to North American culture since the turn of the twentieth century. These fabulous beasts appear in tall tales featuring hodags, giant snakes, fur-bearing trout, and many others. Some such stories lend themselves to comic hoaxing by entrepreneurs who seek attention for their own personal or their region&#x27;s fortune.

==Name==
&quot;Jackalope&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;jackrabbit&quot; and &quot;antelope&quot;.

Jackrabbits are actually hares, rather than rabbits, though both are mammals in the family Leporidae. Wyoming is home to three species of hares, all in the genus &quot;Lepus&quot;. These are the black-tailed jackrabbit, the white-tailed jackrabbit, and the snowshoe hare.

The nominal antelope is not any kind of true, Old World antelope, but actually the pronghorn or American antelope (&quot;Antilocapra americana&quot;), which is more closely related to the giraffe.
Some of the largest herds of wild pronghorns, which are found only in western North America, are in Wyoming. The adults grow to about tall, weigh up to , and can run at sustained speeds approaching .

==Origins==

Stories or descriptions of animal hybrids have appeared in many cultures worldwide. A 13th-century Persian work depicts a rabbit with a single horn, like a unicorn. In Europe, the horned rabbit appeared in Medieval and Renaissance folklore in Bavaria (the wolpertinger) and elsewhere. Natural history texts such as &quot;Historiae Naturalis de Quadrupetibus Libri&quot; (&quot;The History Book of Natural Quadrupeds&quot;) by Joannes Jonstonus (John Jonston) in the 17th century and illustrations such as &quot;Animalia Qvadrvpedia et Reptilia (Terra): Plate XLVII&quot; by Joris Hoefnagel (1522–1600) in the 16th century included the horned hare. These early scientific texts described and illustrated the hybrids as though they were real creatures, but by the end of the 18th century scientists generally rejected the idea of horned hares as a biological species.
References to horned rabbits may originate in sightings of rabbits affected by the Shope papilloma virus, named for Richard E. Shope, M.D., who described it in a scientific journal in 1933. Shope initially examined wild cottontail rabbits that had been shot by hunters in Iowa and later examined wild rabbits from Kansas. They had &quot;numerous horn-like protuberances on the skin over various parts of their bodies. The animals were referred to popularly as &#x27;horned&#x27; or &#x27;warty&#x27; rabbits.&quot; Legends about horned rabbits also occur in Asia and Africa as well as Europe, and researchers suspect the changes induced by the virus might underlie at least some of those tales.

In Central America, mythological references to a horned rabbit creature can be found in Huichol legends. The Huichol oral tradition has passed down tales of a horned rabbit and of the deer getting horns from the rabbit. The rabbit and deer were paired, though not combined as a hybrid, as day signs in the calendar of the Mesoamerican period of the Aztecs, as twins, brothers, even the sun and moon.

===Douglas variant===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; attributes the American jackalope&#x27;s origin to a 1932 hunting outing involving Douglas Herrick (1920–2003) of Douglas, Wyoming. Herrick and his brother had studied taxidermy by mail order as teenagers, and when the brothers returned from a hunting trip for jackrabbits, Herrick tossed a carcass into the taxidermy store, where it came to rest beside a pair of deer antlers. The accidental combination of animal forms sparked Herrick&#x27;s idea for a jackalope. The first jackalope the brothers put together was sold for $10 to Roy Ball, who displayed it in Douglas&#x27; La Bonte Hotel. The mounted head was stolen in 1977. The jackalope became a popular local attraction in Douglas, where the Chamber of Commerce issues Jackalope Hunting Licenses to tourists. The tags are good for hunting during official jackalope season, which occurs for only one day: June 31 (a nonexistent date as June has 30 days), from midnight to 2 a.m. The hunter must have an IQ greater than 50 but not over 72. Thousands of &quot;licenses&quot; have been issued. In Herrick&#x27;s home town of Douglas, there is an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} statue of a jackalope, and the town hosts an annual Jackalope Days Celebration in early June.

Building on the Herrick&#x27;s success, Frank English of Rapid City, South Dakota has made and sold many thousands of jackalopes since retiring from the Air Force in 1981. He is the only supplier of the altered animal heads to Cabela&#x27;s, a major outdoor-theme retail company. His standard jackalopes and &quot;world-record&quot; jackalopes sell for about $150.

In &quot;Man and Beast in American Comic Legend&quot;, folklorist Richard Dorson recounts the Douglas variant but also an alternative that will &quot;surely infuriate the residents of Douglas...&quot;. According to Dorson, in &quot;Mythical Creatures of the North Country&quot; (1969), historian Walker D. Wyman acknowledged the existence of what he called the Alkali Area Jackalope of the western United States. However, he expressed doubt that it predated the Jack-pine Jackalope of Minnesota and Wisconsin, &quot;a mythological throwback that defies even the most competent biologists of the region.&quot; Wyman claimed there were three known specimens of this primary jackalope—in Augusta in west-central Wisconsin; Cornucopia, along the south shore of Lake Superior; and in a north shore museum and lumber camp— all &quot;presumably shot by careless hunters during the deer season.&quot;

In a 1978 revision and expansion of his book, which includes material on the rubberado porcupine, the snoligoster, the three-tailed bavalorus, the squonk, and many other creatures, Wyman devotes four pages to the jackalope. In a turnabout from his earlier claims of a North Country origin for the antlered hare, he says, &quot;The center of its vast range seems to be Wyoming.&quot; Evidence of wide dispersal of &quot;Lepus antilocapra wyomingensis&quot; from its original range, he claims, are labels such as &quot;Tioga, Pennsylvania,&quot; and &quot;Hongkong&quot; stamped on mounted jackalope heads in barrooms across the United States.

==Tall tales==
The jackalope is subject to many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims embedded in tall tales about its habits. Jackalopes are said to be so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored.{{sfnp|Branch|2022|loc=PT32}} Stores in Douglas sell jackalope doe milk, but &quot;The New York Times&quot; questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk.{{sfnp|Branch|2022|loc=PT31}} One of the ways to catch a jackalope is to entice it with whiskey, the jackalope&#x27;s beverage of choice.{{sfnp|Branch|2022|loc=PT31–PT32}}

The jackalope can imitate the human voice, according to legend. During the days of the Old West, when cowboys gathered by the campfires singing at night, jackalopes could be heard mimicking their voices or singing along, usually as a tenor. It is credited with being able to &quot;throw its voice&quot;, and mimic the calls and cries of many mammals, even a chainsaw.{{sfnp|Branch|2022|loc=PT32}} It is said that jackalopes, the rare &quot;Lepus antilocapra&quot;, breed only during lightning flashes and that their antlers make the act difficult despite the hare&#x27;s reputation for fertility. Even the ordinary jackalope only mates during lightning storms, such breeding habits accounting for their scarcity.{{sfnp|Branch|2022|loc=PT31}}

==Official recognition==
In 2005, the legislature of Wyoming considered a bill to make the jackalope the state&#x27;s official mythological creature. It passed the House by a 45–12 margin, but the session ended before the Senate could take up the bill, which died. In 2013, following the death of the bill&#x27;s sponsor, Dave Edwards, the state legislature reintroduced the bill. It again passed the House but died in the rules committee of the Senate. In 2015, three state representatives put forth the jackalope proposal again, this time as House Bill 66, and again it passed the House but died in a Senate committee. One of the co-sponsors, Dan Zwonitzer, said, &quot;I’ll keep bringing it back until it passes.&quot;

In 2014, the Wyoming Lottery adopted a jackalope logo for its lottery tickets and marketing materials. Lottery officials chose the fictitious animal, which they named &quot;YoLo&quot;, over the bucking horse and other state symbols.

==In popular culture==
Since Herrick and his brother began selling manipulated taxidermy heads in the 1930s, such trophies, as well as jackalope postcards and related gift-shop items, can be found in many places beyond Douglas. The student magazine of the Santa Fe University of Art and Design in New Mexico is called &quot;The Jackalope&quot;. On the other side of the world, The Hop Factory craft beer cafe in Newcastle, Australia, uses a leaping jackalope as its logo. In 1986, James Abdnor, a senator from South Dakota, gave U.S. president Ronald Reagan a stuffed jackalope (rabbit head with antlers) during a presidential campaign stop in Rapid City.

Many books, including a large number written for children, feature the jackalope. A search for &quot;jackalope&quot; in the WorldCat listings of early 2015 produced 225 hits, including 57 for books. Among them is &quot;Juan and the Jackalope: A Children&#x27;s Book in Verse&quot; by Rudolfo Anaya. The WorldCat summary of Anaya&#x27;s book says: &quot;Competing for the hand of the lovely Rosita and her rhubarb pie, Juan rides a Jackalope in a race against Pecos Bill.&quot; A short story, &quot;Jackalope Wives&quot; by Ursula Vernon, has been nominated for a 2014 Nebula Award.

The psychonaut Terence McKenna claimed to have encountered a jackalope in the gardens of the Esalen Institute.

Musicians have used the jackalope in various ways. R. Carlos Nakai, a Native American flute player, formerly belonged to a group called Jackalope. In the late 1980s, it performed what Nakai called &quot;synthacousticpunkarachiNavajazz&quot;, which combined &quot;improvisation, visual art, storytelling, dance and dramatic theatrical effects.&quot; Nakai said he wanted people to dream as they listened to the music. Jakalope is a Canadian alternative pop/rock group formed in 2003 by Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie. The band Miike Snow uses the jackalope as its logo. Band member Andrew Wyatt said during an interview in 2012 that the logo was meant to signify experiment and adventure. Of the 225 Worldcat hits resulting from a search for &quot;jackalope&quot;, 95 were related to music.

Jackalopes have appeared in movies and on television. In the 1990s, a jackalope named &quot;Jack Ching Bada Bing&quot; was a recurring character in a series of sketches on the television shows &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot;. The show&#x27;s host, Dave Coulier, voiced the rascally hybrid. In 2003, Pixar featured a jackalope in the short animation &quot;Boundin&#x27;&quot;. The jackalope gave helpful advice to a lamb who was feeling sad after being shorn. In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, the &quot;bunnicorn&quot; of Planet Nepenthe resembles a jackalope, and can be briefly seen in the seventh episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; season one, released in 2020.

Jackalopes have appeared in video games. In &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;, the player is able to hunt and skin jackalopes. Jackalopes are part of the action in &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot;.

A low-budget jackalope mockumentary, &quot;Stagbunny&quot;, aired in Casper and Douglas in 2006. The movie included interviews with the owner of a Douglas sporting goods store who claimed to harbor a live jackalope on his premises and with a paleontologist who explained the natural history of the jackalope and its place in the fossil record.

Beginning in 1997, the Central Hockey League included a team called the Odessa Jackalopes. The team joined the South Division of the North American Hockey League before the 2011–12 season. An Odessa sports writer expressed concern about the team&#x27;s name, which he found insufficiently intimidating and which sounded like &quot;something you might eat for breakfast.&quot;

Jackalope Brewing Company, the first commercial brewery in Tennessee founded by women, opened in Nashville in 2011. Its craft beers include Thunder Ann, Sarka, Fennario, Bearwalker, and Lovebird.

==Scholarly interpretations==
Folklorist John A. Gutowski sees in the Douglas jackalope an example of an American tall tale publicized by a local community that seeks wider recognition. Through a combination of hoax and media activity, the town or other community draws attention to itself for social or economic reasons. A common adjunct to this activity involves the creation of an annual festival to perpetuate the town&#x27;s association with the local legend.

Gutowski finds evidence of what he calls the &quot;protofestival&quot; pattern throughout the United States. In addition to the jackalope, his examples include the sea serpent of Nantucket, which in 1937 led to &quot;stories of armadas hunting the monster, and footprint discoveries by local businessmen&quot;, accompanied by wide publicity. In similar fashion, Newport, Arkansas, publicized its White River Monster, and Algiers, Louisiana, claimed to be home to a flying Devil Man. Ware, Massachusetts, drew media attention to its local reputation for alligator sightings. Perry, New York, held Silver Lake Sea Serpent Festivals based on a local hoax. The Hodag Festival in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, celebrates &quot;discovery&quot; of a prehistoric creature in a nearby pit. Willow Creek, California, hosts an annual Bigfoot Festival. Since 1950, Churubusco, Indiana, has celebrated Turtle Days, based on a story, part real and part invented, about the hunt for the Beast of Busco, a {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} snapping turtle said to be living in a nearby lake.

Common to these tales, Gutowski says, is the recurring motif of the quest for the mythical animal, often a monster. The same motif, he notes, appears in American novels such as &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot; and in monster movies such as &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Jaws&quot; and in world literature such as &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The monster motif also appears in tales of contemporary places outside the United States, such as Scotland, with its Loch Ness Monster. What is not global, Gutowski says, is the embrace of local monster tales by American communities that put them to use through &quot;public relations hoaxes, boisterous boosterism, and [a] carnival atmosphere... &quot;.

Folklorist Richard M. Dorson also cites the &quot;booster impulse, mingled with entrepreneurial hoaxing&quot; as the way that Douglas with its jackalope, Churubusco with its giant turtle, and other towns with their own local legends rise above anonymity. He traces the impulse and the methods to the promotional literature of colonial times that depicted North America as an earthly paradise. Much later, in the 19th century, settlers transferred that optimistic vision to the American West, where it culminated in &quot;boosterism&quot;. Although other capitalist countries advertise their products, Dorson says, &quot;...the intensity of the American ethos in advertising, huckstering, attention-getting, media-manipulating to sell a product, a personality, a town is beyond compare.&quot;

<text>John Bigelow Sr. (November 25, 1817 – December 19, 1911) was an American lawyer, diplomat, and historian who edited the complete works of Benjamin Franklin and the first autobiography of Franklin taken from Franklin&#x27;s previously lost original manuscript. He played a central role in the founding of the New York Public Library in 1895.

==Early life==
Born in Malden-on-Hudson, New York, he graduated in 1835 from Union College, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi Society and the Philomathean Society and was admitted to the bar in 1838. From 1849 to 1861, he was one of the editors and co-owners of the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;.

==Political and literary career==
Bigelow began his political career as a reform Democrat, working with William Cullen Bryant in New York. In 1848, his antislavery convictions led him to leave the party, and he joined the Free Soil Party. In 1856, he led other former Democrats into the newly formed Republican Party and wrote a campaign biography of John C. Frémont, who won the Republican presidential nomination that year. In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln appointed him American consul in Paris, and Bigelow progressed to Chargé d&#x27;Affaires and Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Napoleon III. In this capacity, working together with Charles Francis Adams, the United States minister to the United Kingdom, Bigelow helped to block the attempts to have France and the United Kingdom intervene in the American Civil War in favor of the Confederacy and thereby played a material role in the Union victory. Bigelow also negotiated with Emperor Napoleon III over withdrawing France&#x27;s troops from Mexico, which were supporting Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. Historian Don H. Doyle writes, &quot;Bigelow was one of Seward&#x27;s most brilliant appointees, and he soon became a pioneering master of the arts of public diplomacy in Europe&quot;. On March 15, 1865, Lincoln appointed Bigelow ambassador to France. After leaving this position, he went to Germany, where he lived for three years, through the period of the Franco-Prussian War, and he became a friend of Otto von Bismarck.

After the war&#x27;s conclusion, he returned to New York, where he assisted his old friend Samuel J. Tilden in opposing the corruption that flourished in New York City under William Magear Tweed. Because of the universal respect in which Bigelow was held in New York, he was offered nominations by both political parties for state office in 1872. Under the influence of Tilden, Bigelow decided to rejoin the Democratic party, accepted its nomination, and was elected Secretary of State of New York, a position he held until 1876. When the Democrats nominated Tilden for President in 1876, he served as Tilden&#x27;s campaign manager, and in that capacity advised Tilden in the famous dispute over the result of the presidential election. Tilden died almost a decade after the dispute was decided in favor of his rival, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Bigelow then acted as one of Tilden&#x27;s estate trust executors. He carried out Tilden&#x27;s wishes, over several years, to develop, design, and establish the New York Public Library and served as its first president from May 27, 1895, until his death on December 19, 1911.

He was a staunch proponent of the development of the Panama Canal. He was a friend of Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who brought Panama&#x27;s declaration of Independence to Bigelow&#x27;s home. Panama&#x27;s first proposed flag, made there by Mrs. Bunau Varilla, was rejected by the Panamanians, who made their own.

Bigelow&#x27;s writing career, begun with Bryant on the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;, included several books. He was one of the first Americans to visit Haiti with an open mind, and published &quot;The Wisdom of the Haitians&quot;, which, before the Civil War, was one of the few American works to take a positive view of Haitian independence.

Bigelow published an edition of &quot;The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin&quot; in 1868, the first publication taken from Franklin&#x27;s original, and nearly complete, manuscript, which had been lost sometime after Franklin&#x27;s death. After haggling over the price, he finally agreed to pay the original asking price of 25,000 franks and purchased the manuscript from William Temple Franklin, Benjamin&#x27;s Franklin&#x27;s grandson. Since the manuscript ended at age 51, in 1757, Bigelow re-worked it, incorporating Franklin&#x27;s extensive correspondence, into the three-volume &quot;The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Written by Himself&quot;, first published in 1874.

In 1895 Bigelow published the two-volume &quot;The Life of Samuel J. Tilden&quot;.

==Personal life==
On June 11, 1850, Bigelow married Jane Tunis Poultney and they had nine children. They included:
* John Bigelow Jr. (May 12, 1854 – February 29, 1936) graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1877. He served in the United States Army in Texas with the Buffalo Soldiers, taught at West Point, served again in the West, and fought and was seriously wounded in Cuba. He retired in October 1904. From 1905 to 1910, he was a professor at M.I.T. During World War I, he was recalled to active duty and served in Washington. He traveled and wrote until his death in 1936.
* Poultney Bigelow (1855-1954) was a lawyer and a noted journalist and editor.
* Flora Bigelow, who first married Charles S. Dodge, with whom she had a daughter, Lucie Bigelow Rosen, and a son, John Bigelow Dodge. Flora and Charles divorced, and Flora married The Hon. Lionel Guest (1880–1935), son of Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne (1835–1914).
*In 1854 he had a life-changing experience he wrote about in the book The Bible That Was Lost and is Found.

===Legacy===
On August 8, 2001, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani signed a bill adding the name &quot;John Bigelow Plaza&quot; to the intersection of 41st Street and Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, directly in front of the New York Public Library Main Branch. His estate at Highland Falls, New York, known as The Squirrels, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

<text>&quot;Changelings&quot; is the ninth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, which aired on November 27, 2016. In this episode, Belle&#x27;s pregnancy is sped up, and Aladdin becomes a genie. In flashbacks, Rumpelstiltskin confronts his mother, the Black Fairy, for abandoning him.

==Plot==
===Opening sequence===
A swing set from the Dream World is featured in the forest.

===In the characters&#x27; past===
At Rumplestiltskin&#x27;s castle, Belle is stunned to see Rumplestiltskin bring a child back with him, but as she asks questions, he makes her stop before he leaves again. While reading &quot;Her Handsome Hero&quot; Belle calms the baby down as she plots to track down the parents. Belle enters his secret room and deciphers a scroll with an incantation, but Rumple finds her, locks Belle in the room and disappears with the baby. She is then rescued by The Blue Fairy, who enlists Belle to save the child before he can use it as a way to seek revenge on The Black Fairy, who, like Rumple, is known to take children.

That night in the forest, with the incantation, Rumple summons the Black Fairy and throws squid ink on her to paralyze her. When she warns him that the squid ink won&#x27;t hold her for long, he tells her that his ability to kill her with his Dagger would compel her to stay. He questions her about abandoning babies, and why she abandoned her own child, and she suddenly realizes that the baby he is referring to was Rumplestiltskin himself, as it turns out that he is her son. Though shocked, she recovers and tells him that she abandoned him because &quot;sometimes, you have to choose power over love.&quot; Moments later, Belle shows up to rescue the baby, and the Black Fairy overcomes the effects of the squid ink, and leaves Rumplestiltskin guessing about why she really abandoned him. Afterwards, Belle returns the baby to its parents, as Rumplestiltskin watches, observing the happiness of a family that he never had.

===In Storybrooke===
In the present day at an undisclosed location, Gold chases down and captures a nun, and the Evil Queen has shown up to witness what he planned to do to her, as she is aware of his hatred towards fairies. As Gold reminds the Evil Queen that she is supposed to kill Zelena on his behalf, he proceeds to toss magical dust on the fairy, causing her to age immediately, which he wants to serve as a message to the fairies. This has Belle more worried after seeing the aged nun and knowing that he&#x27;ll use everything to take their child away. While doing research on how to stop Gold, Belle comes across a &quot;Manual on Defeating the Dark One&quot; book and as she opens it; a red string appears on the floor that matches the page on the book. She follows it to her son, who tells her the answer was in front of her. She suddenly wakes up on top of the book, realizing that she was dreaming while searching for the answer.

In the meantime, Jasmine tells Snow that she is nervous about the lamp, assuming that a genie&#x27;s magic could help her find Agrabah, but fears what the genie will want in return. She decides to summon the genie anyway, but when she rubs the lamp, all that comes out are two cuffs, implying that the genie was freed. Aladdin then puts the cuffs on, turning himself into a genie instead. Around the same time, the Evil Queen confronts Zelena and is ready to kill her, but she is stopped by Regina, who squeezes her own heart. Since both are connected, whatever happens to one also affects the other. During Regina&#x27;s confrontation with the Evil Queen, in an effort to save Zelena, Regina tells the Evil Queen that Gold is using her. Since Regina cannot kill the Evil Queen because she would also die, she allows the Evil Queen to get away. Despite saving Zelena&#x27;s life, Regina continues to blame her for Robin&#x27;s death and tells Zelena she cannot forgive her.

The book that Belle slept on captures the attention of Hook as the book is written in Squid ink, and suggests that he and Emma take care of the situation. When they arrive to the Pawn Shop, Hook provokes Gold&#x27;s anger to allow Emma to use the ink on him. As they are searching the shop, Emma sees the sword from her visions and has a vision upon touching the sword, resulting in her hands shaking again. When Hook &amp; Emma check on Gold, they realize he escaped the squid ink. Gold, ready to confront Belle with the aging dust, tells her that he thinks their son may be the only person who could ever love him and is willing to do anything to steal their child from her. However, Gold starts having second thoughts after Belle tells him that he might also lose her forever.

At Granny&#x27;s, Belle, Emma, and Hook have a conversation. As Emma tells Hook that a new vision involving her death has appeared, Belle drops her mug on the ground, revealing that the tea she was drinking had a potion that causes her pregnancy to accelerate and she goes into labor. As Emma and the fairies help Belle deliver, she finds herself again in the dream world talking to her son, who gives his mother a message, “you know what you must do.&quot; As Belle successfully delivers the baby, she asks Mother Superior to make a request to be his fairy godmother and to take him far away from Storybrooke, where he will be safe from Gold. Belle then names her son Gideon, in honor of her favorite book hero before Mother Superior sends the child away. The nuns/fairies &amp; Emma had placed a protection on the nunnery to prevent Gold from entering until the baby was delivered. Thus Gold enters after the Blue Fairy/Mother Superior has already taken his son. Belle refuses to tell Gold their son&#x27;s name, but he vows to find him regardless.

When Gold returns to his shop, the Evil Queen is waiting and tells him that she is responsible for placing the spell in Belle&#x27;s tea that resulted in her pregnancy to accelerate. The Evil Queen tells Gold that he just “made an enemy” of her, but he counters that she is merely a pawn in his game and vows to get even, but not before she leaves with a message about the way &quot;Fairies make great mothers&quot; (now that she knows that The Black Fairy is Gold&#x27;s mother), then he throws everything to the ground. Finally, after Hook tells her that Regina reversed the aging spell on the nun, Emma tells Hook that she feels stronger than ever, ready to confront her vision, returned to the shop, where she finds the sword that will kill her in her vision and takes it.

<doc id="233487" wikidata="Q206976" url="?curid=233487" title="Tachometer">
<text>A tachometer (revolution-counter, tach, rev-counter, RPM gauge) is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a shaft or disk, as in a motor or other machine. The device usually displays the revolutions per minute (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, but digital displays are increasingly common.

The word comes . Essentially the words tachometer and speedometer have identical meaning: a device that measures speed. It is by arbitrary convention that in the automotive world one is used for engine revolutions and the other for vehicle speed. In formal engineering nomenclature, more precise terms are used to distinguish the two.

==History==
The first tachometer was described by Bryan Donkin in a paper to the Royal Society of Arts in 1810 for which he was awarded the Gold medal of the society. This consisted of a bowl of mercury constructed in such a way that centrifugal force caused the level in a central tube to fall when it rotated and brought down the level in a narrower tube above filled with coloured spirit. The bowl was connected to the machinery to be measured by pulleys.

The first mechanical tachometers were based on measuring the centrifugal force, similar to the operation of a centrifugal governor. The inventor is assumed to be the German engineer Dietrich Uhlhorn; he used it for measuring the speed of machines in 1817. Since 1840, it has been used to measure the speed of locomotives.

==In automobiles, trucks, tractors and aircraft==

Tachometers or revolution counters on cars, aircraft, and other vehicles show the rate of rotation of the engine&#x27;s crankshaft, and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds. This can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions. Prolonged use at high speeds may cause inadequate lubrication, overheating (exceeding capability of the cooling system), exceeding speed capability of sub-parts of the engine (for example spring retracted valves) thus causing excessive wear or permanent damage or failure of engines. On analogue tachometers, speeds above maximum safe operating speed are typically indicated by an area of the gauge marked in red, giving rise to the expression of &quot;redlining&quot; an engine — revving the engine up to the maximum safe limit. Most modern cars typically have a revolution limiter which electronically limits engine speed to prevent damage. Diesel engines with traditional mechanical injector systems have an integral governor which prevents over-speeding the engine, so the tachometers in vehicles and machinery fitted with such engines sometimes lack a redline.

In vehicles such as tractors and trucks, the tachometer often has other markings, usually a green arc showing the speed range in which the engine produces maximum torque, which is of prime interest to operators of such vehicles. Tractors fitted with a power take-off (PTO) system have tachometers showing the engine speed needed to rotate the PTO at the standardized speed required by most PTO-driven implements. In many countries, tractors are required to have a speedometer for use on a road. To save fitting a second dial, the vehicle&#x27;s tachometer is often marked with a second scale in units of speed. This scale is only accurate in a certain gear, but since many tractors only have one gear that is practical for use on-road, this is sufficient. Tractors with multiple &#x27;road gears&#x27; often have tachometers with more than one speed scale. Aircraft tachometers have a green arc showing the engine&#x27;s designed cruising speed range.

In older vehicles, the tachometer is driven by the RMS voltage waves from the low tension (LT contact breaker) side of the ignition coil, while on others (and nearly all diesel engines, which have no ignition system) engine speed is determined by the frequency from the alternator tachometer output. This is from a special connection called an &quot;AC tap&quot; which is a connection to one of the stator&#x27;s coil output, before the rectifier. Tachometers driven by a rotating cable from a drive unit fitted to the engine (usually on the camshaft) exist - usually on simple diesel-engined machinery with basic or no electrical systems. On recent EMS found on modern vehicles, the signal for the tachometer is usually generated from an ECU which derives the information from either the crankshaft or camshaft speed sensor.

===Traffic engineering===
Tachometers are used to estimate traffic speed and volume (flow). A vehicle is equipped with the sensor and conducts &quot;tach runs&quot; which record the traffic data. These data are a substitute or complement to loop detector data. To get statistically significant results requires a high number of runs, and bias is introduced by the time of day, day of week, and the season. However, because of the expense, spacing (a lower density of loop detectors diminishes data accuracy), and relatively low reliability of loop detectors (often 30% or more are out of service at any given time), tach runs remain a common practice.

==In trains and light rail vehicles==

Speed sensing devices, termed variously &quot;wheel impulse generators&quot; (WIG), pulse generators, speed probes, or tachometers are used extensively in rail vehicles. Common types include opto-isolator slotted disk sensors and Hall effect sensors.

Hall effect sensors typically use a rotating target attached to a wheel, gearbox or motor. This target may contain magnets, or it may be a toothed wheel. The teeth on the wheel vary the flux density of a magnet inside the sensor head. The probe is mounted with its head a precise distance from the target wheel and detects the teeth or magnets passing its face. One problem with this system is that the necessary air gap between the target wheel and the sensor allows ferrous dust from the vehicle&#x27;s underframe to build up on the probe or target, inhibiting its function.

Opto-isolator sensors are completely encased to prevent ingress from the outside environment. The only exposed parts are a sealed plug connector and a drive fork, which is attached to a slotted disk internally through a bearing and seal. The slotted disk is typically sandwiched between two circuit boards containing a photo-diode, photo-transistor, amplifier, and filtering circuits which produce a square wave pulse train output customized to the customer&#x27;s voltage and pulses per revolution requirements. These types of sensors typically provide 2 to 8 independent channels of output that can be sampled by other systems in the vehicle such as automatic train control systems and propulsion/braking controllers.

The sensors mounted around the circumference of the disk provide quadrature encoded outputs and thus allow the vehicle&#x27;s computer to determine the direction of rotation of the wheel. This is a legal requirement in Switzerland to prevent &quot;rollback&quot; when starting from standstill. Strictly, such devices are not tachometers since they do not provide a direct reading of the rotational speed of the disk. The speed has to be derived externally by counting the number of pulses in a time period. It is difficult to prove conclusively that the vehicle is stationary, other than by waiting a certain time to ensure that no further pulses occur. This is one reason why there is often a time delay between the train stopping, as perceived by a passenger, and the doors being released. Slotted-disk devices are typical sensors used in odometer systems for rail vehicles, such as are required for train protection systems — notably the European Train Control System.

As well as speed sensing, these probes are often used to calculate distance travelled by multiplying wheel rotations by wheel circumference.

They can be used to automatically calibrate wheel diameter by comparing the number of rotations of each axle against a master wheel that has been measured manually. Since all wheels travel the same distance, the diameter of each wheel is proportional to its number of rotations compared to the master wheel. This calibration must be done while coasting at a fixed speed to eliminate the possibility of wheel slip/slide introducing errors into the calculation. Automatic calibration of this type is used to generate more accurate traction and braking signals, and to improve wheel slip detection.

A weakness of systems that rely on wheel rotation for tachometry and odometry is that the train wheels and the rails are very smooth and the friction between them is low, leading to high error rates if the wheels slip or slide. To compensate for this, secondary odometry inputs employ Doppler radar units beneath the train to measure speed independently.

==In analogue audio recording==

In analogue audio recording, a tachometer is a device that measures the speed of audiotape as it passes across the head. On most audio tape recorders the tachometer (or simply &quot;tach&quot;) is a relatively large spindle near the ERP head stack, isolated from the feed and take-up spindles by tension idlers.

On many recorders the tachometer spindle is connected by an axle to a rotating magnet that induces a changing magnetic field upon a Hall effect transistor. Other systems connect the spindle to a stroboscope, which alternates light and dark upon a photodiode.

The tape recorder&#x27;s drive electronics use signals from the tachometer to ensure that the tape is played at the proper speed. The signal is compared to a reference signal (either a quartz crystal or alternating current from the mains). The comparison of the two frequencies drives the speed of the tape transport. When the tach signal and the reference signal match, the tape transport is said to be &quot;at speed.&quot; (To this day on film sets, the director calls &quot;Roll sound!&quot; and the sound man replies &quot;Sound speed!&quot; This is a vestige of the days when recording devices required several seconds to reach a regulated speed.)

Having perfectly regulated tape speed is important because the human ear is very sensitive to changes in pitch, particularly sudden ones, and without a self-regulating system to control the speed of tape across the head, the pitch could drift several percent. This effect is called a wow-and-flutter, and a modern, tachometer-regulated cassette deck has a wow-and-flutter of 0.07%.

Tachometers are acceptable for high-fidelity sound playback, but not for recording in synchronization with a movie camera. For such purposes, special recorders that record pilottone must be used.

Tachometer signals can be used to synchronize several tape machines together, but only if in addition to the tach signal, a directional signal is transmitted, to tell slave machines in which direction the master is moving.

<text>Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.

ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.

Statistics and mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning. 

From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.

== History ==

The term &quot;machine learning&quot; was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. The synonym &quot;self-teaching computers&quot; was also used in this time period.

Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book &quot;The Organization of Behavior&quot;, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb&#x27;s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.

By the early 1960s, an experimental &quot;learning machine&quot; with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively &quot;trained&quot; by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a &quot;goof&quot; button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson&#x27;s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.

Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: &quot;A computer program is said to learn from experience &quot;E&quot; with respect to some class of tasks &quot;T&quot; and performance measure &quot;P&quot; if its performance at tasks in &quot;T&quot;, as measured by &quot;P&quot;, improves with experience &quot;E&quot;.&quot; This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing&#x27;s proposal in his paper &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot;, in which the question &quot;Can machines think?&quot; is replaced with the question &quot;Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?&quot;.

Modern-day machine learning has two objectives. One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.

== Relationships to other fields ==

=== Artificial intelligence ===

As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed &quot;neural networks&quot;; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics. Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.

However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor. Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval. Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as &quot;connectionism&quot;, by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield, David Rumelhart, and Geoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.

Machine learning (ML), reorganized and recognized as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory.

=== Data compression ===
=== Data mining===
Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on &quot;known&quot; properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) &quot;unknown&quot; properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as &quot;unsupervised learning&quot; or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to &quot;reproduce known&quot; knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously &quot;unknown&quot; knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.

Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: Many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).

=== Generalization ===
Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.

=== Statistics ===
Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns. According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics. He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.

Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.

Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, wherein &quot;algorithmic model&quot; means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest.

Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call &quot;statistical learning&quot;.

===Statistical physics===
Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks. Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.

== Theory ==

A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience. Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.

The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.

For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.

In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.

== Approaches ==

Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the &quot;signal&quot; or &quot;feedback&quot; available to the learning system:
* Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a &quot;teacher&quot;, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
* Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
* Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that&#x27;s analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize. 
Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.

=== Supervised learning ===
Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. The data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.

Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression. Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. Examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person, or the future temperature.

Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.

=== Unsupervised learning ===

Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation.

Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called &quot;clusters&quot;) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some &quot;similarity metric&quot; and evaluated, for example, by &quot;internal compactness&quot;, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and &quot;separation&quot;, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on &quot;estimated density&quot; and &quot;graph connectivity&quot;.

A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.

=== Semi-supervised learning ===
Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.

In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.

=== Reinforcement learning ===
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.

=== Dimensionality reduction ===
Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the &quot;number of features&quot;. Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D).
The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization.

=== Other types ===
Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, topic modeling, meta-learning.

==== Self-learning ====
Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named &quot;crossbar adaptive array&quot; (CAA). It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.
The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: 
# in situation &quot;s&quot; perform action &quot;a&quot;
# receive a consequence situation &quot;s&quot;&#x27;
# compute emotion of being in the consequence situation &quot;v(s&#x27;)&quot;
# update crossbar memory &quot;w&#x27;(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s&#x27;)&quot;

It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.

==== Feature learning ====
Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.

Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization and various forms of clustering.

Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.

Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.

==== Sparse dictionary learning ====

Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix. The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the &quot;k&quot;-SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.

==== Anomaly detection ====

In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.

In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.

Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.

==== Robot learning ====
Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and finally meta-learning (e.g. MAML).

==== Association rules ====

Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of &quot;interestingness&quot;.

Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves &quot;rules&quot; to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.

Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule formula_1 found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.

Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.

Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.

Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. The term &quot;inductive&quot; here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.

== Models ==
A is a type of mathematical model that, once &quot;trained&quot; on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model&#x27;s internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions. By extension, the term &quot;model&quot; can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.

Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection.

=== Artificial neural networks ===

Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems &quot;learn&quot; to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.

An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called &quot;artificial neurons&quot;, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a &quot;signal&quot;, from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called &quot;edges&quot;. Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.

The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.

Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.

=== Decision trees ===

Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item&#x27;s target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making.

=== Random Forest Regression ===
Random forest regression (RFR) falls under umbrella of decision tree-based models.  RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting.  To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling, for instance each decision tree is trained on random data of from training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single output data as well multiple regressor task. This makes RFR compatible to be used in various application. 

=== Support-vector machines ===

Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category. An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

=== Regression analysis ===

Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.

Multivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images, which are inherently multi-dimensional.

=== Bayesian networks ===

A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.

=== Gaussian processes ===

A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations.

Given a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point.

Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization.

=== Genetic algorithms ===

A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.

=== Belief functions ===

The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g., Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities. However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner&#x27;s decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving. However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.

=== Training models ===
Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.

==== Federated learning ====

Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users&#x27; privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users&#x27; mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.

In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first &quot;Netflix Prize&quot; competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&amp;T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million. Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers&#x27; ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (&quot;everything is a recommendation&quot;) and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly. In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis. In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists. In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning. In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19. Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behavior of travelers. Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone&#x27;s performance and thermal behavior based on the user&#x27;s interaction with the phone. When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS.

Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.

Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes. Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.

== Limitations ==
Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results. Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.

The &quot;black box theory&quot; poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data. The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an &quot;intelligence system&quot; that could have a &quot;substantial impact on an individual&#x27;s life&quot; would not be considered acceptable unless it provided &quot;a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions&quot; it makes.

In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision. Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested. Microsoft&#x27;s Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.

Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.

=== Explainability ===
Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It contrasts with the &quot;black box&quot; concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.

=== Overfitting ===

Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.

=== Other limitations and vulnerabilities ===
Learners can also disappoint by &quot;learning the wrong lesson&quot;. A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses. A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in &quot;adversarial&quot; images that the system misclassifies.
Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel. Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning.

Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories &quot;spam&quot; and well-visible &quot;not spam&quot; of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access.

== Model assessments ==
Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.

In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model.

== Ethics ==
=== Bias ===
Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.

Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices. For example, in 1988, the UK&#x27;s Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George&#x27;s Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names. Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants. Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica&#x27;s predictive algorithm that resulted in &quot;disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities&quot; after being trained with historical crime data.

While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning&#x27;s vulnerability to biases. In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, &quot;female faculty merely make up 16.1%&quot; of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world. Furthermore, among the group of &quot;new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,&quot; 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.

Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases. Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language &quot;corpora&quot; will necessarily also learn these biases. In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay, a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.

In an experiment carried out by ProPublica, an investigative journalism organization, a machine learning algorithm&#x27;s insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged &quot;black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants&quot;. In 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognize gorillas. Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.

Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains. Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who said that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s nothing artificial about AI. It&#x27;s inspired by people, it&#x27;s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.&quot;

=== Financial incentives ===
There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public&#x27;s interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm&#x27;s proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.

== Hardware ==
Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units. By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI. OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.

===Neuromorphic computing===

Neuromorphic computing refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. These systems may be implemented through software-based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialized hardware architectures.

==== physical neural networks ====
A physical neural network is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials, such as memristors, to emulate the function of neural synapses. The term &quot;physical neural network&quot; highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses.

===Embedded machine learning===
Embedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources, such as wearable computers, edge devices and microcontrollers. Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets. Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques, such as hardware acceleration, approximate computing, and model optimization. Common optimization techniques include pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, low-rank factorization, network architecture search, and parameter sharing.

<text>A minaret (; , or ; ; ) is a type of tower typically built into or adjacent to mosques. Minarets are generally used to project the Muslim call to prayer (&quot;adhan&quot;) from a muezzin, but they also served as landmarks and symbols of Islam&#x27;s presence. They can have a variety of forms, from thick, squat towers to soaring, pencil-thin spires.

== Etymology ==
Two Arabic words are used to denote the minaret tower: &quot;manāra&quot; and &quot;manār&quot;. The English word &quot;minaret&quot; originates from the former, via the Turkish version (). The Arabic word &quot;manāra&quot; (plural: &quot;manārāt&quot;) originally meant a &quot;lamp stand&quot;, a cognate of Hebrew &quot;menorah&quot;. It is assumed to be a derivation of an older reconstructed form, &quot;manwara&quot;. The other word, &quot;manār&quot; (plural: &quot;manā&#x27;ir&quot; or &quot;manāyir&quot;), means &quot;a place of light&quot;. Both words derive from the Arabic root &quot;n-w-r&quot;, which has a meaning related to &quot;light&quot;. Both words also had other meanings attested during the early Islamic period: &quot;manār&quot; could also mean a &quot;sign&quot; or &quot;mark&quot; (to show one where to go) and both &quot;manār&quot; and &quot;manāra&quot; could mean &quot;lighthouse&quot;.

==Functions==

The formal function of a minaret is to provide a vantage point from which the muezzin can issue the call to prayer, or &quot;adhan&quot;. The call to prayer is issued five times each day: dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, and night. In most modern mosques, the &#x27; is called from the &#x27; (prayer hall) via microphone to a speaker system on the minaret.

Additionally, minarets historically served a visual symbolic purpose. In the early 9th century, the first minarets were placed opposite the qibla wall. Oftentimes, this placement was not beneficial in reaching the community for the call to prayer. They served as a reminder that the region was Islamic and helped to distinguish mosques from the surrounding architecture. They also acted as symbols of the political and religious authority of the Muslim rulers who built them.

==Construction and design==
The region&#x27;s socio-cultural context has influenced the shape, size, and form of minarets. Different regions and periods developed different styles of minarets. Typically, the tower&#x27;s shaft has a cylindrical, cuboid (square), or octagonal shape. Stairs or ramps inside the tower climb to the top in a counterclockwise fashion. Some minarets have two or three narrow staircases fitted inside one another in order to allow multiple individuals to safely descend and ascend simultaneously. At the top of the stairs, a balcony encircles the upper sections of the tower and from here the muezzin may give the call to prayer. Some minaret traditions featured multiple balconies along the tower&#x27;s shaft. The summit often finishes in a lantern-like structure and/or a small dome, conical roof, or curving stone cap, which is in turn topped by a decorative metal finial. Different architectural traditions also placed minarets at different positions relative to the mosque. The number of minarets by mosques was also not fixed: originally only one minaret accompanied a mosque, but some later traditions constructed more, especially for larger or more prestigious mosques.

Minarets are built out of any material that is readily available, and often changes from region to region. In the construction of the tall and slender Ottoman minarets, molten iron was poured into pre-cut cavities inside the stones, which then solidified and helped to bind the stones together. This made the structures more resistant to earthquakes and powerful winds.
==Origins==

The earliest mosques lacked minarets, and the call to prayer was often performed from smaller tower structures. The early Muslim community of Medina gave the call to prayer from the doorway or roof of the house of Muhammad, which doubled as a place for prayer, and this continued to be the practice in mosques during the period of the four Rashidun Caliphs (632–661).

The origin of the minaret is unclear. Many 19th-century and early 20th-century scholars traced the origin of minarets to the Umayyad Caliphate period (661–750) and believed that they imitated the church steeples found in Syria in those times. Others suggested that these towers were inspired by the ziggurats of Babylonian and Assyrian shrines in Mesopotamia. Some scholars, such as A. J. Butler and Hermann Thiersch, agreed that the Syrian minarets were derived from church towers but also argued that the minarets of Egypt were inspired by the form of the Pharos Lighthouse in Alexandria (which survived up until medieval times). K. A. C. Creswell, an orientalist and important early-20th-century scholar of Islamic architecture, contributed a major study on the question in 1926 which then became the standard scholarly theory on the origin of minarets for roughly fifty years.Creswell attributed the origin of minaret towers to the influence of Syrian church towers and regarded the spiral or helicoidal minarets of the Abbasid period as deriving from local ziggurat precedents, but rejected the possible influence of the Pharos Lighthouse. He also established that the earliest mosques had no minarets and he suggested that the first purpose-built minarets were built for the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in Fustat in 673. In 1989 Jonathan Bloom published a new study which argued that the first true minaret towers did not appear until the 9th century, under Abbasid rule, and that their initial purpose was not related to the call to prayer.

References on Islamic architecture since the late 20th century often agree with Bloom&#x27;s view that the mosques of the Umayyad Caliphate did not have minarets in the form of towers. Instead of towers, some Umayyad mosques were built with platforms or shelters above their roofs that were accessed by a staircase and from which the muezzins could issue the call to prayer. These structures were referred to as a &quot;mi&#x27;dhana&quot; (&quot;place of the &quot;adhān&quot;&quot;) or as a &quot;ṣawma῾a&quot; (&quot;monk&#x27;s cell&quot;, due to its small size). An example of these platforms is documented during the reconstruction of the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in 673 by Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s local governor, Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Ansari, who was given orders by the caliph to add one to each of the mosque&#x27;s four corners, similar to the Great Mosque of Damascus which had a &quot;ṣawma῾a&quot; above each of the Roman-era towers at its four corners. Historical sources also mention such features in mosques in other parts of North Africa. In another example, under the Umayyad Emirate of al-Andalus, emir Hisham I ordered the addition of a &quot;ṣawma&#x27;a&quot; to the Great Mosque of Cordoba in 793.

A possible exception to the absence of tower minarets is documented in Caliph al-Walid&#x27;s renovation of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina in the early 8th century, during which he built a tower, referred to as a &quot;manāra&quot;, at each of the mosque&#x27;s four corners. However, it is not clear what function these towers served. They do not appear to have been used for the call to prayer and may have been intended instead as visual symbols of the mosque&#x27;s status. Historical sources also reference an earlier &quot;manāra&quot;, built of stone, being added to the mosque of Basra in 665 by the Umayyad provincial governor, but it is not entirely clear if it was a tower or what form it had, though it must have had a monumental appearance.
The first known minarets built as towers appeared under Abbasid rule. Four towers were added to the Great Mosque of Mecca during its Abbasid reconstruction in the late 8th century. In the 9th century single minaret towers were built in or near the middle of the wall opposite the qibla wall of mosques. These towers were built across the empire in a height to width ratio of around 3:1. One of the oldest minarets still standing is that of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, built in 836 and well-preserved today. Other minarets that date from the same period, but less precisely dated, include the minaret of the Friday Mosque of Siraf, now the oldest minaret in Iran, and the minaret opposite the qibla wall at the Great Mosque of Damascus (known as the &quot;Minaret of the Bride&quot;), now the oldest minaret in the region of Syria (though its upper section was probably rebuilt multiple times). In Samarra, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate in present-day Iraq, the Great Mosque of Samarra was built in the years 848–852 and featured a massive helicoidal minaret behind its northern wall. Its design was repeated in the nearby Abu Dulaf Mosque (861). The earlier theory which proposed that these helicoidal minarets were inspired by ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats has been challenged and rejected by some later scholars including Richard Ettinghausen, Oleg Grabar, and Jonathan Bloom.

Bloom also argues that the early Abbasid minarets were not built to host the call to prayer, but were instead adopted as symbols of Islam that were suited to important congregational mosques. Their association with the muezzin and the call to prayer only developed later. As the first minaret towers were built by the Abbasids and had a symbolic value associated with them, some of the Islamic regimes opposed to the Abbasids, such as the Fatimids, generally refrained from building them during these early centuries. The earliest evidence of minarets being used for hosting the call to prayer dates to the 10th century and it was only towards the 11th century that minaret towers became a near-universal feature of mosques.

Next to the Huaishengsi Mosque in Guangzhou is the Tower of Light, also known as the Guangta minaret (1350). The mosque and the minaret merge aspects of Islamic and Chinese architecture. Its circular shaft and the double staircase arrangement inside it resembles the minarets of Iranian and Central Asian architecture, such as the Minaret of Jam.

=== Egypt ===
The style of minarets has varied throughout the history of Egypt. The minaret of the 9th-century Ibn Tulun Mosque imitated the spiral minarets of contemporary Abbasid Samarra, though the current tower was reconstructed later in 1296. Under the Fatimids (10th-12th centuries), new mosques generally lacked minarets. One unusual exception is the Mosque of al-Hakim, built between 990 and 1010, which has two minarets at its corners. The two towers have slightly different shapes: both have square bases but one has a cylindrical shaft above this and the other an octagonal shaft. This multi-tier design was only found in the minarets of the great mosques at Mecca and Medina at that time, suggesting a possible link to those designs. Shortly after their construction, the lower sections of the minarets were encased in massive square bastions, for reasons that are not clearly known, and the tops were rebuilt in 1303 by a Mamluk sultan.

Under the Ayyubids (late 12th to mid-13th centuries), the details of minarets borrowed from Fatimid designs. Most distinctively, the summits of minarets had a lantern structure topped by a pointed ribbed dome, whose appearance was compared to a &quot;mabkhara&quot;, or incense burner. This design continued under the early Bahri Mamluks (13th to early 14th century), but soon began to evolve into the shapes distinctive to Mamluk architecture. They became very ornate and usually consisted of three tiers separated by balconies, with each tier having a different design than the others. This configuration was particularly characteristic of Cairo. The minaret of the al-Maridani Mosque (circa 1340) is the first one to have an entirely octagonal shaft and the first one to end with a narrow lantern structure consisting of eight slender columns topped by a bulbous stone finial. This style later became the basic standard form of Cairene minarets, while the &quot;makhbara&quot;-style summit disappeared.

Later minarets in the Burji Mamluk period (late 14th to early 16th centuries) typically had an octagonal shaft for the first tier, a round shaft on the second, and a lantern structure with finial on the third level. The stone-carved decoration of the minaret also became very extensive and varied from minaret to minaret. Minarets with completely square or rectangular shafts reappeared at the very end of the Mamluk period during the reign of Sultan al-Ghuri (r. 1501–1516). During al-Ghuri&#x27;s reign, the lantern summits were also doubled – as with the minaret of the Mosque of Qanibay Qara or al-Ghuri&#x27;s minaret at the al-Azhar Mosque – or even quadrupled – as with the original minaret of al-Ghuri&#x27;s madrasa.

===Iran, Central Asia, and South Asia===
Starting with the Seljuk period (11th and 12th centuries), minarets in Iran had cylindrical shafts with square or octagonal bases that taper towards their summit. These minarets became the most common style in the eastern Islamic world (in Iran, Central Asia, and South Asia). During the Seljuk period minarets were tall and highly decorated with geometric and calligraphic design. They were built prolifically, even at smaller mosques or mosque complexes. The Kalyan Minaret in Bukhara remains the most well known of the Seljuk minarets for its use of brick patterned decoration. The tallest minaret of this era, the Minaret of Jam, in a remote area of present-day Afghanistan, was built by the Ghurids and features elaborate brick decoration and inscriptions. The Qutb Minar in Delhi, the most monumental minaret in India, was built in 1199 and was designed on the same model as the Minaret of Jam.In later periods, however, minarets in this region became generally less monumental in comparison with the mosques for which they were built. The tradition of building pairs of minarets probably began in the 12th century, but it became especially prominent under the Ilkhanids (13th-14th centuries), who built twin minarets flanking important iwans such as the mosque&#x27;s entrance. 

The rise of the Timurid Empire, which heavily patronized art and architecture, led to what is now called the &quot;international Timurid&quot; style which spread from Central Asia during and after the 15th century. It is categorized by the use of multiple minarets. Examples of this style include the monuments of Mughal architecture in the Indian subcontinent, such as the minarets on the roof of the south gate in Akbar&#x27;s Tomb at Sikandra (1613), the minarets on the Tomb of Jahangir (1628-1638), and the four minarets surrounding the mausoleum of the Taj Mahal. Elsewhere in India, some cities and towns along the coast have small mosques with simple staircase minarets.

===Iraq===
The oldest minarets in Iraq date from the Abbasid period. The Great Mosque of Samarra (848–852) is accompanied by one of the earliest preserved minarets, a cylindrical brick tower with a spiral staircase wrapped around it, standing outside the walls of the mosque. It is the tallest of the early minarets of the Abbasid period and remains the most massive historic minaret in the world, involving over 6000 cubic meters of brick masonry. The Abu Dulaf Mosque, built near Samarra and finished in 861, has a smaller minaret of similar shape.

In the later Abbasid period (11th to 13th centuries), after the Seljuk period, minarets were typically cylindrical brick towers whose square or polygonal bases were integrated into the structure of the mosque itself. Their main cylindrical shafts were tapered and culminated in &quot;muqarnas&quot; cornices supporting a balcony, above which is another small cylindrical turret topped by a dome. Two examples of this style are the Mosque of al-Khaffafin and the Mosque of Qumriyya.

===Maghreb and al-Andalus===
Minarets in the Maghreb (region encompassing present-day Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, and Western Sahara) and historical al-Andalus (present-day Gibraltar, Portugal, Spain, and Southern France) traditionally have a square shaft and are arranged in two tiers: the main shaft, which makes up most of its height, and a much smaller secondary tower above this which is in turn topped by a finial of copper or brass spheres. Some minarets in the Maghreb have octagonal shafts, though this is more characteristic of certain regions or periods; e.g. the minarets of the Great Mosque of Chefchaouen, the Great Mosque of Ouazzane, the Kasbah Mosque of Tangier, and the Great Mosque of Asilah in Morocco or the Ottoman-era minarets of Tunisia such as the Youssef Dey Mosque and the Hammouda Pacha Mosque. Inside the main shaft a staircase, and in other cases a ramp, ascends to the top of the minaret.

The minaret at the Great Mosque of Kairouan, built in 836 under Aghlabid rule, is the oldest minaret in North Africa and one of the oldest minarets in the world. It has the shape of a massive tower with a square base, three levels of decreasing widths, and a total height of 31.5 meters. The first two levels are from the original 9th-century construction but the third level was reconstructed at a later period. Another important minaret for the architectural history of the region is the minaret built by Abd ar-Rahman III for the Great Mosque of Cordoba in 951–952, which became the model for later minarets in the Maghreb and al-Andalus. Jonathan Bloom has suggested that Abd ar-Rahman III&#x27;s construction of the minaret – along with his sponsoring of other minarets around the same time in Fez – was partly intended as a visual symbol of his self-declared authority as caliph and may have also been aimed at defying the rival Fatimid Caliphs to the east who did not endorse the construction of minarets at the time. Other important historic minarets in the region are the Almohad-era minarets of the Kutubiyya Mosque and the Kasbah Mosque in Marrakesh, the Hassan Tower in Rabat, and the Giralda in Seville, all from the 12th and early 13th centuries.

===Turkey===
The Seljuks of Rum, a successor state of the Seljuk Empire, built paired portal minarets from brick that had Iranian origins. In general, mosques in Anatolia had only one minaret and received decorative emphasis while most of the mosque remained plain. Seljuk minarets were built of stone or brick, usually resting on a stone base, and typically had a cylindrical or polygonal shaft that is less slender than later Ottoman minarets. They were sometimes embellished with decorative brickwork or glazed ceramic decoration up the level of their balconies.

Ottoman architecture followed earlier Seljuk models and continued the Iranian tradition of cylindrical tapering minaret forms with a square base. Classical Ottoman minarets are described as &quot;pencil-shaped&quot; due to their slenderness and sharply-pointed summits, often topped with a crescent moon symbol. The presence of more than one minaret, and of larger minarets, was reserved for mosques commissioned by the Ottoman sultans themselves such as the Süleymaniye Mosque. Taller minarets often also had multiple balconies (known as in Turkish) along their shafts instead of one. The Üç Şerefeli Mosque in Edirne, finished in 1447, was the first sultanic mosque to have multiple minarets with multiple balconies. Of its four minarets, the northwestern minaret was the tallest Ottoman minaret up to that time, rising to 67 metres. Its height was only surpassed by the minarets of the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne (1574), which are 70.89 meters tall and are the tallest minarets in Ottoman architecture. Later Ottoman minarets also became plainer and more uniform in design. The trend of multiple minarets culminated in the six minarets of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (also known as the Blue Mosque) in Istanbul.
