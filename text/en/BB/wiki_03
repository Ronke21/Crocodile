<doc id="226445" wikidata="Q320639" url="?curid=226445" title="Noel Redding">
<text>Noel David Redding (25 December 1945 – 11 May 2003) was an English rock musician, best known as the bass player for the Jimi Hendrix Experience and guitarist/singer for Fat Mattress.

Following his departure from the Experience in 1969 and the dissolution of Fat Mattress in 1970, Redding formed the short-lived group Road in the United States, which released the self-titled album &quot;Road&quot; before he re-located to Clonakilty, Ireland, in 1972. There he formed the Noel Redding Band with former Thin Lizzy guitarist Eric Bell, with whom he released two albums. Although by the 1980s Redding had largely removed himself from the music business, he would later perform around his new hometown with wife Carol Appleby.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of the Jimi Hendrix Experience.

=== Background ===
Redding was born at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Folkestone, Kent, to Bromley-born Margaret (née Berggren) and Horace Albert Redding. He grew up on Cliff Road, Seabrook, where his mother ran a guest house, with his Swedish-born grandmother, his brother Anthony, and his sister Vicki. He attended St Leonards Primary school in Hythe, and the Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone. At the age of nine he played violin at school, and then mandolin and guitar. His first public appearances were at the Hythe Youth Club, and at his school.

At 17, Redding became a professional musician and toured clubs in Scotland and Germany with Neil Landon and the Burnettes (formed in late 1962) and the Loving Kind (formed in November 1965). In addition, the Lonely Ones reunited in September 1964, and Redding remained with them a year before taking his leave.

=== The Jimi Hendrix Experience ===

Upon his arrival in England in September 1966, Jimi Hendrix and his producer/manager Chas Chandler set about finding backing musicians. Although Redding had played guitar up to that point, he switched to bass guitar and became the second member of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, followed shortly by drummer Mitch Mitchell, to form a power trio. With the group, he recorded three landmark albums: &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;. Redding also wrote and sang lead on two songs, &quot;Little Miss Strange&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s So Fine&quot;. His playing style was distinguished by the use of a pick, a mid-range &quot;trebly&quot; sound, and in later years the use of fuzz and distortion effects through overdriven Sunn amps. For the bass line in &quot;Red House&quot; (take used on &quot;Smash Hits&quot;), Redding was recorded playing on a normal six-string guitar.

By 1969, Hendrix was performing and recording with a number of different musicians. Without consulting Redding, Hendrix announced that he intended to expand the group. Redding responded by quitting the Experience during the American tour on 29 June 1969, and returned to England. However, when Hendrix&#x27;s attempts to form a new group were unsuccessful, his manager, Michael Jeffery, tried to reunite the Experience in early 1970. The three were interviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine to announce the reformation, but ultimately Redding was passed over in favour of bassist Billy Cox, who had performed with Hendrix at Woodstock and on the &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot; album with Buddy Miles.

===Fat Mattress===

In 1968, Redding formed the group Fat Mattress with another Kent musician, Neil Landon. The band also included Jim Leverton on bass and keyboards and Eric Dillon on drums. Redding played guitar and vocals, and a key part of the Fat Mattress sound was the vocal harmonies between him, Landon and Leverton. The band initially toured in support of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, requiring Redding to play two full sets each night. He left Fat Mattress after only one album with them, though some of his compositions would appear on their second album.

==Later years==

Redding soon went on to other projects. While living in Los Angeles, he formed Road, a three-piece in the same psychedelic hard rock vein as the Experience, with Rod Richards (ex-Rare Earth) on guitar and Les Sampson on drums, and Redding switching back to bass. They released one album, &quot;Road&quot; (1972), with the three members taking turns on lead vocals.

Redding moved to Ireland in 1972. He formed the Noel Redding Band with Eric Bell (from Thin Lizzy), Dave Clarke, Les Sampson, and Robbie Walsh. Despite the band&#x27;s name, Redding shared songwriting and lead vocal duties equally with Clarke. They released two albums for RCA, three tours of the Netherlands, two tours of England, one tour of Ireland, and a 10-week tour in the US. The band dissolved after a dispute with their management company. Tracks recorded for a third unreleased album were later released as &quot;The Missing Album&quot; on Mouse Records.

In his book &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;, co-authored with his wife Carol Appleby, he spoke openly about his disappointment in his being cut off from the profits of the continued sale of the Hendrix recordings. He had signed away his royalties in 1974, and in 1980 sold the bass guitar he used with the Experience to a collector. Redding had received $100,000 as a one-off payment after he had been told that there would be no more releases of Jimi Hendrix Experience material. This was before the advent of CDs and DVDs.

In 1990, Redding and Appleby were involved in a car crash returning home from a concert in Glounthaune. Appleby was left brain dead by the accident, with Redding later stating that &quot;she was in intensive care on life support and after four days I had to make the terrible decision of shutting down the machine&quot;. They had been together for seventeen years and, just two days prior to the accident, Appleby had finished helping Redding co-write his autobiography.

In 1997, Fender produced the Noel Redding Signature Jazz bass in a signed limited edition of 1000. Premiered at the NAMM Show in January 1997, the bass was based on the 1965 Jazz bass which Redding used throughout his time with the Experience. Redding tracked down the person to whom he had sold the bass some years prior, who agreed to allow Fender to inspect it. Redding stated that &quot;Fender got the original bass from him, copied it, and sent me a prototype, and it was exactly the same as my original bass; they did a brilliant job&quot;.

After meeting San Francisco musician and songwriter Keith Dion in London during the awarding of an English Heritage Blue Plaque Award in 1997, Redding performed several tours across the United States with Dion&#x27;s band &quot;3:05 AM&quot;. Recordings from these tours were released on the UK and European releases &quot;West Cork Tuning&quot; and &quot;Stone Free&quot;. Video footage from these tours was shown in May 2014 during the now annual Noel Redding Tribute Festival held in Clonakilty each year. Positive feedback was also received from the Irish Cultural Minister and the head of the Irish Film Board.

In 2002, a live album &quot;Live From Bunkr Prague&quot; was released. Predominantly made up of Experience material, the concert was recorded in 1995 in the Czech Republic with guitarist and singer Anthony Krizan of the Spin Doctors, rhythm guitarist Ivan Kral of the Patti Smith Group and drummer Frankie LaRocka. The band rehearsed for a mere 45 minutes before performing. Vaclav Havel, the then President of the Czech Republic watched from the side of the stage.

Redding&#x27;s last performance was in Clonakilty at De Barras pub, where he had held the Friday night residency for nearly 20 years, performing with some of the local musicians who appeared on his last album &quot;Thank You, Goodnight and Good Luck&quot; including Steve Pawsey, Jeff Ward, Jim O&#x27;Neil, Eric Bell and Les Sampson.

== Death ==
Redding was found dead in his home in Clonakilty on 11 May 2003, three weeks after the death of his mother. A postmortem was carried out on 13 May at Cork University Hospital in Wilton, Cork. The report concluded that Redding died from &quot;shock haemorrhage due to oesophageal varices in reaction to cirrhosis of the liver&quot;. He was 57 years old and survived by a brother, a sister and a son, Nicolas Noel Redding, by his former wife, Danish-born Susanne.

==Legacy==
In the village of Ardfield, local people erected a plaque to Redding&#x27;s memory. His then partner, the US-born Deborah McNaughton, had returned to America where she died from breast cancer nine months after Redding&#x27;s death.

Three months prior to his death, Redding had threatened to sue Experience Hendrix, LLC, the company that manages the Hendrix catalogue, for £3.26 million in lost earnings. The estate rejected his claim and went on to release a posthumous compilation album entitled &quot;The Experience Sessions&quot; in 2004. Along with unreleased takes of Redding-penned Experience album tracks &quot;She&#x27;s So Fine&quot; and &quot;Little Miss Strange&quot;, the album contained unreleased songs recorded by The Jimi Hendrix Experience which Redding had written whilst with the band. Most of the tracks are outtakes from the &quot;Axis: Bold As Love&quot; and &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; albums, and feature Redding on guitar with Hendrix on bass. It also featured a live version of Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Red House&quot; with Redding on rhythm guitar. Notably the album features the song &quot;Dream&quot;, but omits the other Redding-penned song &quot;Dance&quot; which was recorded during the same session on which Hendrix participated on bass. Written by Redding for drummer Mitch Mitchell to sing, Hendrix would later take Redding&#x27;s guitar riff and use it for his own song &quot;Ezy Rider&quot;, which was first released on the posthumous album &quot;The Cry of Love&quot;.

A town square in Redding&#x27;s hometown of Folkestone was renamed &quot;Noel&#x27;s Yard&quot; as a memorial, described as being &quot;a public &#x27;Theatre in a Square&#x27; which promotes commerce, the arts, entertainment, as well as the best of British seaside living within a vibrant and safe creative community&quot;.

In 2013, an art exhibition was organised to mark the 10th anniversary of Redding&#x27;s death. It was opened by his brother Anthony.

<text>Imaging is the representation or reproduction of an object&#x27;s form; especially a visual representation (i.e., the formation of an image).

Imaging technology is the application of materials and methods to create, preserve, or duplicate images. 

Imaging science is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the generation, collection, duplication, analysis, modification, and visualization of images, including imaging things that the human eye cannot detect. As an evolving field it includes research and researchers from physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer vision, computer science, and perceptual psychology.

&quot;Imagers&quot; are imaging sensors.

==Imaging chain==
The foundation of imaging science as a discipline is the &quot;imaging chain&quot; – a conceptual model describing all of the factors which must be considered when developing a system for creating visual renderings (images). In general, the links of the imaging chain include:

# &quot;The human visual system&quot;. Designers must also consider the psychophysical processes which take place in human beings as they make sense of information received through the visual system.
# &quot;The subject of the image&quot;. When developing an imaging system, designers must consider the observables associated with the subjects which will be imaged. These observables generally take the form of emitted or reflected energy, such as electromagnetic energy or mechanical energy.
# &quot;The capture device&quot;. Once the observables associated with the subject are characterized, designers can then identify and integrate the technologies needed to capture those observables. For example, in the case of consumer digital cameras, those technologies include optics for collecting energy in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and electronic detectors for converting the electromagnetic energy into an electronic signal.
# &quot;The processor&quot;. For all digital imaging systems, the electronic signals produced by the capture device must be manipulated by an algorithm which formats the signals so they can be displayed as an image. In practice, there are often multiple processors involved in the creation of a digital image.
# &quot;The display&quot;. The display takes the electronic signals which have been manipulated by the processor and renders them on some visual medium. Examples include paper (for printed, or &quot;hard copy&quot; images), television, computer monitor, or projector.

Note that some imaging scientists will include additional &quot;links&quot; in their description of the imaging chain. For example, some will include the &quot;source&quot; of the energy which &quot;illuminates&quot; or interacts with the subject of the image. Others will include storage and/or transmission systems.

==Subfields==
Subfields within imaging science include: image processing, computer vision, 3D computer graphics, animations, atmospheric optics, astronomical imaging, biological imaging, digital image restoration, digital imaging, color science, digital photography, holography, magnetic resonance imaging, medical imaging, microdensitometry, optics, photography, remote sensing, radar imaging, radiometry, silver halide, ultrasound imaging, photoacoustic imaging, thermal imaging, visual perception, and various printing technologies.

== Methodologies ==
* Acoustic imaging
* &quot;Coherent imaging&quot; uses an active coherent illumination source, such as in radar, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), medical ultrasound and optical coherence tomography; &quot;non-coherent imaging&quot; systems include fluorescent microscopes, optical microscopes, and telescopes. 
* Chemical imaging, the simultaneous measurement of spectra and pictures
* Digital imaging, creating digital images, generally by scanning or through digital photography
* Disk image, a file which contains the exact content of a data storage medium
* Document imaging, replicating documents commonly used in business
* Geophysical imaging
* Industrial process imaging
* Medical imaging, creating images of the human body or parts of it, to diagnose or examine disease
** Medical optical imaging

* Range imaging, for obtaining images with depth information
* Reprography, reproduction of graphics through electrical and mechanical means
** Cinematography
** Photography, the process of creating still images
** Xerography, the method of photocopying
* Speckle imaging, a method of shift-and-add for astronomical imaging
* Stereo imaging, an aspect of sound recording and reproduction concerning spatial locations of the performers
* Thermography, infrared imaging
*Tactile imaging, also known as elastography

<text>The gadwall (Mareca strepera) is a common and widespread dabbling duck in the family Anatidae.

==Taxonomy==
The gadwall was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. DNA studies have shown that it is a sister species with the falcated duck; the two are closely related to the three species of wigeons, and all of them have been assigned to the genus &quot;Mareca&quot;. There are two subspecies:
* &quot;M. s. strepera&quot;, the common gadwall, described by Linnaeus, is the nominate subspecies.
* &quot;M. s. couesi&quot;, Coues&#x27;s gadwall, extinct 1874, was formerly found only on Teraina, a coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean.

The specific name &quot;strepera&quot; is Late Latin for &quot;noisy&quot;. The etymology of the word &quot;gadwall&quot; is not known, but the name has been in use since 1666.

== Description ==
The gadwall is long with a wingspan. The male is slightly larger than the female, weighing on average against her . The breeding male is patterned grey, with a black rear end, light chestnut wings, and a brilliant white speculum, obvious in flight or at rest. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female, but retains the male wing pattern, and is usually greyer above and has less orange on the bill.

The female is light brown, with plumage much like a female mallard. It can be distinguished from that species by the dark orange-edged bill, smaller size, the white speculum, and white belly. Both sexes go through two moults annually, following a juvenile moult.

The gadwall is a quieter duck, except during its courtship display. Females give a call similar to the &quot;quack&quot; of a female mallard but higher-pitched, transcribed as &quot;gag-ag-ag-ag&quot;. Males give a grunt, transcribed as &quot;mep&quot;, and a whistle.

== Distribution ==
The gadwall breeds in the northern areas of Europe and across the Palearctic, and central North America. In North America, its breeding range lies along the Saint Lawrence River, through the Great Lakes, Alberta, Saskatchewan, the Dakotas, south to Kansas, west to California, and along coastal Pacific Canada and southern coastal Alaska. The range of this bird appears to be expanding into eastern North America. This dabbling duck is strongly migratory, and winters farther south than its breeding range, from coastal Alaska, south into Central America, and east into Idaho, Kansas, Ohio, Virginia, and then south all the way into Central America.

In Great Britain, the gadwall is a scarce-breeding bird and winter visitor, though its population has increased in recent years. It is likely that its expansion was partly through introduction, mainly to England, and partly through colonization by continental birds staying to breed in Scotland. In Ireland a small breeding population has recently become established, centred on County Wexford in the south and Lough Neagh in the north. The Gadwall is also seen in some parts of South Asia, particularly the southern part of India.

== Behaviour ==

The gadwall is a bird of open wetlands, such as prairie or steppe lakes, wet grassland or marshes with dense fringing vegetation, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food with head submerged. They can also dive underwater for food, more proficiently than other dabbling ducks, and may also steal food from diving birds such as coots. It nests on the ground, often some distance from water. It is not as gregarious as some dabbling ducks outside the breeding season and tends to form only small flocks.

Gadwalls are monogamous and may start breeding after their first year. Pair formation begins during fall migration or on breeding grounds, but has also been reported to occur in August when males are still in eclipse plumage. Gadwalls are generally quiet, except during courtship. The male utters a &quot;mep&quot; call during a display known as the &quot;burp&quot;, where he raises his head pointing his bill towards a female. The &quot;grunt-whistle&quot; is similar to that of mallards, where the male rears his outstretched head with the bill dipped into water, displacing a stream of water droplets towards a nearby female as the bill is raised against the chest. During this display the male makes a loud whistle call followed by a low &quot;burp&quot;. Paired males may follow other females in flight displays.

During nesting season, the female lays a clutch of 7–12 eggs with each of them measuring in length and in width. Incubation lasts for 24–27 days and the nestlings leave after around 1–2 days. A gadwall can only raise one brood a season

== Conservation ==
Currently, the gadwall is listed as least concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The gadwall is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Populations have increased approximately 2.5% over the course of 49 years (from 1966 to 2010), and continue to grow. Gadwalls are one of the most hunted duck species (3rd to the mallard and green-winged teal), with 1.7 million shot each year.

Because of the efforts of the United States and Canadian groups Ducks Unlimited, Delta Waterfowl Foundation and other private conservation groups, the species continues to be sustainably hunted there.

<text>Crème de cassis () (also known as Cassis liqueur) is a sweet, dark red liqueur made from blackcurrants.

Several cocktails are made with crème de cassis, notably the popular wine cocktail kir and its sparkling variant, the kir royal. Other cocktails that use it include the original tequila sunrise and the El Diabolo, a tequila buck.

It may also be served as an after-dinner liqueur or as a .

==Ingredients==
It is made from blackcurrants that are crushed and soaked in alcohol, with sugar subsequently added.

The quality of crème de cassis depends upon the variety of fruit used, the content of the berries, and the production process.

==Origin and production==
The modern version of the beverage first appeared in 1841, when it displaced &quot;ratafia de cassis&quot;, which had been produced in prior centuries.

While crème de cassis is a specialty of Burgundy, it is also made in Anjou, England, Luxembourg, Alberta, Quebec, Vermont and Tasmania.

In 1979, Germany attempted to restrict the import based on the alcohol content being too low. The Europe Court of Justice found this to be a breach of trade, in &quot;Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopolverwaltung für Branntwein&quot;.

In 2015, the new protected geographical indication (PGI) &quot;Crème de Cassis de Bourgogne&quot; was approved. Promoted by a syndicate of fruit producers and liqueurs companies from Burgundy, this &quot;Crème de Cassis de Bourgogne&quot; guarantees the Burgundian origin and the minimum quantity of berries used in its production, essentially the variety Noir de Bourgogne. If the berries come specifically from Dijon, the capital of Burgundy, the label may say &quot;Crème de Cassis de Dijon&quot; instead.

==Sales==
Nearly of crème de cassis are produced annually in France. It is consumed mostly in France but is also exported.

<text>The McDonnell F3H Demon is a subsonic swept-wing carrier-based jet fighter aircraft designed and produced by the American manufacturer McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. It was the first swept wing jet fighter and the only single-engined carrier-based fighter the company produced.

The Demon was developed during the late 1940s and early 1950s to fulfill a United States Navy requirement for a high-performance swept wing naval fighter to succeed the F2H Banshee. On 7 August 1951, the &quot;XF3H-1&quot; performed its maiden flight, flown by test pilot Robert Edholm. The original design for a short-range interceptor was reworked into a heavier medium-range all-weather fighter to counter the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighter being encountered during the Korean War; however, the addition of about of weight negatively impacted the Demon&#x27;s performance. The Demon was originally designed to be powered by the Westinghouse J40 turbojet engine, which suffered severe problems including low thrust output and poor reliability, and was ultimately abandoned after the matter became politically controversial in 1955. This outcome necessitated another major redesign of the aircraft to accept the alternative Allison J71 powerplant.

On 7 March 1956, the Demon was introduced to operational service. Though the aircraft had insufficient power for supersonic performance and insufficient endurance for its intended general-purpose role, it complemented day fighters such as the Vought F8U Crusader and Grumman F11F Tiger as an all-weather, missile-armed interceptor. The Demon was withdrawn in 1964 and thus did not participate in the Vietnam War. Both it and the Crusader were replaced on &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class and similar supercarriers by the more capable and versatile McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, which bears a strong family resemblance, as it was conceived as an advanced development of the Demon. The supersonic F-101 Voodoo of the United States Air Force was similar in layout, but was derived from the earlier XF-88 Voodoo, which also influenced the Demon&#x27;s layout.

==Development==
===Background===

Although the existence of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighter program was unknown to U.S. intelligence at the time, the United States Navy anticipated the appearance of high-performance Soviet jet fighters, and issued requirements for a high-performance swept wing naval fighter on 21 May 1948. McDonnell was one of six aircraft companies that opted to produce a response, beginning development work during 1949. The design team chose to develop an all-new aircraft incorporating a swept wing configuration from the onset rather than adapting a straight wing into a swept wing design as had been done with the competing Grumman F9F Cougar. Roll control was achieved via ailerons augmented by a compact spoiler. Furthermore, both the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces were also swept back. It was the company&#x27;s first swept wing design, and was amongst the first American aircraft to be primarily armed with missiles rather than cannons.

The resulting aircraft, which later received the name &quot;Demon&quot;, emerged as an all-new design. In order to fulfil the U.S. Navy&#x27;s requirements, McDonnell agreed to power the aircraft with the Westinghouse J40 engine which was then under development. At the time, the J40 was being promoted by Navy officials for its next generation of aircraft, and was to have thrust of over 11,000 lbf (49 kN)—three times that of the engines used on the McDonnell F2H Banshee. Having gained the interest of U.S. Navy officials, McDonnell was issued with a development contract to produce two &quot;XF3H-1&quot; prototypes on 30 September 1949, albeit as a fallback measure to the unconventional Douglas F4D Skyray. At this stage of development, it was envisioned as a day fighter. McDonnell named the aircraft &quot;Demon&quot; shortly thereafter.

The unexpected combat debut of the MiG-15 during the Korean War motivated the U.S. Navy to place the Demon as a top priority, having observed the MiG to have considerably outclassed both the Panther and Banshee; the only American fighter then in service that could equal the MiG was the North American F-86 Sabre, which was only operated by the United States Air Force. Seeking to better respond to the MiG, the U.S. Navy pushed for the aircraft to be heavily redesigned, reorienting it from the short-range interceptor mission once envisioned towards a medium-range all-weather fighter; adapting the design necessitated the addition of 7,000 Ibs. of weight to an aircraft that originally weight 22,000 lbs, thus negatively impacting its performance.

===Initial flights and engine difficulties===
During March 1951, the aircraft was hastily ordered into production for an initial batch of 150 &quot;F3H-1N&quot;s. This order came prior to even reviewing the mockup, which occurred in July of that year. On 7 August 1951, the prototype performed its maiden flight at the hand of test pilot Robert Edholm. It quickly proved to be relatively easy to fly, fairly maneuverable, and the controls were responsive, yet it was also severely underpowered, particularly impacting high altitude flight. This prototype was lost during a test flight roughly four months later. The first test flights of the operational design did not occur until January 1953, by which time the conflict in Korea was drawing to a close.

The Demon had originally been designed around the ambitious Westinghouse J40 engine, which was to provide enough power to permit the use of just one engine in a number of new aircraft. However, this engine would ultimately fail to produce the promised thrust or to even run reliably; its performance was a major disappointment, producing only half of the expected power. It also suffered from a restricted flight envelope and frequent compressor stalls. The airframe&#x27;s use of an uncommon annular air intake, which inherently results in relatively poor pressure recovery, may have also contributed to the performance difficulties.

James Smith McDonnell, president of McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, personally wrote to Washington, warning that the engine would be a &quot;disappointingly underpowered combination&quot; and requesting a substitute engine be permitted. Instead, the U.S. Navy opted to persist with the J40 engine in the hope that development of a more powerful version, the J40-10, would proceed rapidly; instead, Westinghouse proved unable to smoothly progress on the project and the issue became increasingly politically charged as time went on. Of the 35 &quot;F3H-1N&quot; aircraft flown with the J40 engine, eight were involved in major accidents. The first production Demons were grounded after the loss of six aircraft and four pilots. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the Navy&#x27;s grounding of all Westinghouse-powered F3H-1 Demons a &quot;fiasco&quot;, with 21 unflyable planes that could be used only for Navy ground training at a loss of $200 million. One high point of the J40 was the 1955 setting of an unofficial time-to-climb record, in a Demon, of in 71 seconds. However, the J40 program was terminated sometime during 1955.

All of the aircraft that the J40 was to power were either canceled or redesigned to use other engines, notably the J57 and the J71. The F4D Skyray had been designed to accept larger engines in case the J40 did not work out, and was eventually powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57. But no other engine could simply be fitted into the old Demons, necessitating both the wings and fuselage to be redesigned and enlarged. The associated cost and delayed were such that the U.S. Navy considered cancelling development of the Demon as well. The best alternative turned out to be the Allison J71 engine, which was also powered the Douglas B-66 Destroyer. Subsequent F3Hs with this powerplant were designated the &quot;F3H-2N&quot;. In service, the J71 proved problematic, providing insufficient power for an aircraft of the Demon&#x27;s size, while also suffering from frequent flameouts and compressor stalls. During October 1954, the first J71-powered Demon was flown. Another significant problem was the reliability of the in-house developed ejection seat: initial versions were found to be unreliable and were eventually replaced with Martin-Baker ejection seats that were becoming the standard U.S. Navy seat of choice due to their higher performance at low altitude and better reliability.

===Production===
Despite the problems encountered, the U.S. Navy placed an order for 239 &quot;F3H-2&quot;s, the first of which being deployed during March 1956. 519 Demons were constructed before production was terminated during November 1959. It was not the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first all-weather interceptor with radar (the AN/APG-51 air interception set was used first on the F2H-4 Banshee). The F3H-2 Demon had the AN/APG-51A, later upgraded to the 51-B version with a tunable magnetron then on to 51-C with better countermeasures in the receiver. It was a relatively straightforward radar arrangement in comparison to that of the Skyray. Furthermore, upgrading this radar proved to be somewhat easy as well.

The F3H-2N&#x27;s standard armament was four 20 mm (.79 in) Colt Mk 12 cannons. In later years, the upper two cannons were often omitted to save weight. Later models, redesignated &quot;F3H-2M&quot;, were equipped to fire the Raytheon AAM-N-2 Sparrow and later the Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. Deployed aircraft carried both types of missiles, the Sparrow on the inboard rails and the Sidewinder outboard. Cannons were not used in carrier air defense applications, but they were installed and armed when situations (such as the Cuban Missile Crisis) dictated, and where the aircraft might be deployed against surface targets. Furthermore, up to 6,000 pounds of external stores, including fuel tanks, bombs and rocket pods, could be carried. The additional range provided by external fuel tanks was relatively small due to parasitic drag.

At a late stage of development, the nose had been tilted downwards by ten degrees to improve the pilot&#x27;s forward and downward visibility. The windscreen was also changed multiple times with the same aim in mind. Due to the excellent visibility from the cockpit, the Demon earned the nickname &quot;The Chair&quot;. Demon pilots were known colloquially as &quot;Demon Drivers&quot; while ground crews who worked on the aircraft were known as &quot;Demon Doctors&quot;. The unfavorable power-to-weight ratio gave rise to the less flattering nickname &quot;lead sled&quot;, sometimes shortened to &quot;sled&quot;. Pilots observed its favourable flying characteristics and high level of stability when being flown at high altitude and during carrier operations, being relatively easy to land under almost any circumstance.

A reconnaissance version of the aircraft, the &quot;F3H-2P&quot;, was proposed, but ultimately never built. The Demon was flown as the U.S. Navy&#x27;s front-line fighter up until 1962, at which point it was succeeded by the newer and faster F-4 Phantom II (which was a development of a proposed &quot;Super Demon&quot;, a larger and much heavier version of the F3H). Developed during the Korean War to counter the MiG-15, it did not claim any aerial victories either with missiles or during dogfights, although it flew over Lebanon and Quemoy during 1958.

In 1962, the F3H was redesignated &quot;F-3&quot;. The &quot;F3H-2N&quot; became the &quot;F-3C&quot;, the F3H-2M became &quot;MF-3B&quot;, and the F3H-2 changed to &quot;F-3B&quot;. During September 1964, the final Demon-equipped squadron, VF-161 &#x27;Chargers&#x27;, traded their F-3s for F-4 Phantom IIs.

<doc id="226475" wikidata="Q131469" url="?curid=226475" title="Flag of Malta">
<text>The flag of Malta () is a bicolour, with white in the hoist and red in the fly. A representation of the George Cross, awarded to Malta by George VI in 1942, is carried, edged with red, in the canton of the white stripe. The flag was first recognized in May of 1952. It is the only national flag to feature English-language text (&quot;For Gallantry&quot; on the George Cross). 

==Design==
===Construction sheet===

===Colours===
The red hue in the Maltese flag is officially documented as Pantone 186 C, RGB (207,20,43), Hex #CF142B or Spot Colour - 50% rubine red • 50% warm red.

The constitution of Malta also states that the white side must be on the hoist pole while the red side must be &quot;in the fly&quot;.

Tradition states that the colours of the flag were given to Malta by Roger I of Sicily in 1091. Roger&#x27;s fleet landed in Malta on the completion of the Norman conquest of Sicily. It is said that local Christians offered to fight by Roger&#x27;s side against the Arab defenders. In order to recognize the locals fighting on his side from the defenders, Roger reportedly tore off part of his chequered red-and-white flag. However, this story has been debunked as a 19th-century myth, possibly even earlier due to Mdina, Malta&#x27;s old capital, associating its colours with Roger&#x27;s in the late Middle Ages.

The white and red standard was reportedly used by Maltese insurgents during a rebellion against French occupation in September 1798.

The flag of the Knights of Malta, a white cross on a red field, was a more likely source of the Maltese colours, inspiring the red and white shield used during the British colonial period. The flag used by the knights was also known to be the oldest still-in-use national flag. The blue canton present in the 1943 to 1964 version of the flag was removed after Maltese independence, with the George cross instead given a red fimbriation.

==The George Cross==

The George Cross originally appeared on the flag placed on a blue canton (see List of flags of Malta). The flag was changed on 21 September 1964 with Malta&#x27;s independence when the blue canton was replaced by a red fimbriation, the intention being that the Cross appear less prominent. His Majesty King George the Sixth bestowed the George Cross to Malta on April 15, 1942. in recognition of its courageousness during World War II. The symbol was later officially added to the Maltese flag on 28 December 1943 despite symbolism being in circulation between April 1942 and December 1943 depicting the flag.

=== Campaign ===
Every few years, the debate to remove the George Cross from the national flag comes up. In 1975 an act passed in parliament allowing the George Cross to be removed by a simple parliament majority with the reasoning being that the cross ties Malta to its turbulent, colonial past. A campaign on social media in 2013 further emphasized this point, coming up with an alternative of replacing it with the Maltese cross. 

Critics of the George Cross argue that the George Cross ties Malta to its Colonial history, and that no other nation has a military award on its national flag. Arguments in favour of keeping the George Cross on the national flag argue that the George Cross shows Maltese strength and determination during World War II.

In spite of the campaign, the removal of the George Cross from the Maltese Flag has been met with pushback by some members of the population. 

==Civil ensign==

The civil ensign shows a red field, bordered white and charged with a blank Maltese cross. It is also known as the Merchant&#x27;s flag and/or the maritime flag of Malta.

<doc id="226476" wikidata="Q502886" url="?curid=226476" title="Madchester">
<text>Madchester was a musical and cultural scene that emerged in the English city of Manchester during the late 1980s, closely associated with the indie dance movement. Indie dance (also referred to as indie rave) blended indie rock with elements of acid house, psychedelia, and 1960s pop.

The term &quot;Madchester&quot; was coined by Factory Records&#x27; Tony Wilson, and was popularised by the British music press in the early 1990s. However, the origin of the term can be traced to a script meeting between Factory Records video directors Philip Shotton and Keith Jobling, known as &quot;the Bailey Brothers.&quot; They coined &quot;Madchester&quot; while developing a script and later suggested it to Tony Wilson. Subsequently, Wilson instructed the band Happy Mondays to rename their EP from &quot;Rave On&quot; to &quot;Madchester Rave On.&quot; The Happy Mondays&#x27; lead vocalist, Shaun Ryder, recalled: &quot;It was our video directors, the Bailey Brothers, who came up with the term &#x27;Madchester,&#x27; but we said, &#x27;Great, yeah, go with it,&#x27; because Manchester was mad at the time.&quot;

The scene&#x27;s most famous groups include the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, the Charlatans, James, and 808 State. The movement was heavily influenced by the widespread use of drugs, particularly MDMA, also known as &quot;MD&quot; or &quot;Ecstasy.&quot;

A major catalyst for the distinctive musical ethos in the city was the Haçienda nightclub, co-owned by members of New Order, which played a pivotal role in the movement known as the Second Summer of Love.

==Pre-Madchester==
The music scene in Manchester immediately before the Madchester era was dominated by The Smiths, New Order, and The Fall, who became significant influences on the Madchester movement. The opening of The Haçienda nightclub in May 1982, an initiative by Factory Records, was also instrumental in shaping Manchester&#x27;s popular culture. During its early years, the club primarily featured club-oriented pop music and hosted gigs by artists such as New Order, Cabaret Voltaire, Culture Club, Thompson Twins, and The Smiths. DJs like Hewan Clarke and Greg Wilson contributed to the club&#x27;s prominence. By 1986, The Haçienda shifted its focus from being a live venue to a dance club.

The Festival of the Tenth Summer in July 1986, organised by Factory Records, reinforced Manchester&#x27;s reputation as a hub for alternative pop culture. The festival featured film screenings, a music seminar, art exhibitions, and performances by the city&#x27;s leading bands, including an all-day concert at Manchester G-Mex with A Certain Ratio, The Smiths, New Order, and The Fall. According to Dave Haslam, the festival showcased how &quot;the city had become synonymous with larger-than-life characters playing cutting-edge music. [...] Individuals were inspired and the city was energised; of its own accord, uncontrolled.&quot;

In addition to these venues and events, the warehouse parties organised by Steve Adge were crucial in the development of the scene. The Stone Roses&#x27; warehouse parties, first held in 1985, were significant, with DJ Dave Booth supporting the Stone Roses&#x27; live performances. These parties, including the notable &quot;Warehouse 1, The Flower Show&quot; event on 20 July 1985, played a vital role in establishing the band&#x27;s following and the burgeoning music scene in Manchester. Booth was an influential DJ in Manchester&#x27;s music landscape. He co-created the Playpen nights and the Blood Club and was a resident DJ at several key venues in Manchester&#x27;s alternative club network. He began his career at the Roxy Room in Pips and performed at other clubs like Devilles, Berlin, Cloud 9, and Legends, helping to create a network of venues that fostered the growth of Manchester&#x27;s alternative music scene. The city&#x27;s emerging bands, including the Stone Roses, frequented these clubs and drew inspiration from the diverse music played by DJs.

In 1987, the Haçienda began playing house music, with DJs Mike Pickering, Graeme Park, and &quot;Little&quot; Martin Prendergast hosting &quot;Nude Night&quot; on Fridays. The Haçienda transitioned from making a consistent loss to selling out by early 1987. During that year, it hosted performances by American house artists such as Frankie Knuckles and Adonis.

Other clubs in the Manchester area began embracing house music, including Devilles, Isadora&#x27;s, Konspiracy, House, Soundgardens, and Man Alive in the city centre, as well as Bugsy&#x27;s in Ashton-under-Lyne and the Osbourne Club in Miles Platting. Another key factor in the rise of Madchester was the sudden availability of the drug MDMA in the city, starting in 1987 and increasing in the following year. According to Haslam, &quot;[MDMA] use changed clubs forever; a night at the Haçienda went from being a great night out to an intense, life-changing experience&quot;.

The British music scene was such that &quot;The Guardian&quot; later stated, &quot;The &#x27;80s looked destined to end in musical &quot;. The Madchester movement flourished as its sound was fresh and innovative, quickly gaining popularity. Music by artists such as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays began to chart highly in 1989, with New Order releasing the acid house-influenced &quot;Technique&quot;, which topped the UK Albums Chart.

==Beginnings==
In October 1988, the Stone Roses released &quot;Elephant Stone&quot; as a single. Around the same time, the Happy Mondays released the single &quot;Wrote for Luck,&quot; followed by the &quot;Bummed&quot; album, produced by Martin Hannett. In November, A Guy Called Gerald released his first solo single, &quot;Voodoo Ray.&quot; Only &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; achieved commercial success; however, by December of that year, a sense had begun to emerge in the British music press that something was happening in the city. According to Sean O&#x27;Hagan, writing in the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;There is a particularly credible music biz rumour-come theory that certain Northern towns—Manchester being the prime example—have had their water supply treated with small doses of mind-expanding chemicals. [...] Everyone from Happy Mondays to the severely disoriented Morrissey conforms to the theory in some way. Enter A Guy Called Gerald, out of his box on the limitless possibilities of a bank of keyboards.&quot;

The Stone Roses&#x27; following grew as they toured the country and released the &quot;Made of Stone&quot; single in February 1989. Although this did not chart, enthusiasm for the band in the music press intensified when they released their debut album, &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; (produced by John Leckie) in March. Bob Stanley (later of Saint Etienne) reviewed the Stone Roses album in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, writing, &quot;This is simply the best debut LP I&#x27;ve heard in my record-buying lifetime. Forget everybody else. Forget work tomorrow.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; did not put it quite so strongly, but reported nonetheless that it was being talked of as &quot;the greatest album ever made.&quot; John Robb in &quot;Sounds&quot; gave the album 9/10 and stated that the Stone Roses &quot;revolutionised British pop.&quot;

The club scene in Manchester continued to grow during 1988 and 1989, with the Haçienda launching Ibiza-themed nights in the summer of 1988 and the &quot;Hot&quot; acid house night (hosted by Mike Pickering and Jon DaSilva) in November of the same year.

== Baggy ==

The &quot;baggy&quot; sound generally combines funk, psychedelia, guitar rock, and house music. In the Manchester context, the music is primarily influenced by the indie music that had dominated the city&#x27;s music scene during the 1980s, while also absorbing the various influences emerging from &quot;the Haçienda&quot; nightclub. Alongside the music, a distinctive style of dressing emerged that gave baggy its name. Baggy jeans (often flared, typically made by Shami Ahmed&#x27;s &#x27;Joe Bloggs&#x27; brand), along with brightly colored or tie-dye casual tops and a general 1960s style, became fashionable first in Manchester and then across the country. This look was often topped off with a fishing hat in the style worn by the Stone Roses&#x27; drummer Alan &quot;Reni&quot; Wren. The overall style was a mix of rave, retro, hippie, and football casual. Many Madchester bands had football casual fans, and several bands even wore football shirts.

==Growing success==
In mid-1989, media interest in the Manchester scene continued to grow. In September, the Happy Mondays released a Vince Clarke remix of &quot;Wrote for Luck&quot; as a single. In November, four significant singles were released: &quot;Move&quot; by the Inspiral Carpets, &quot;Pacific State&quot; by 808 State, the Happy Mondays EP &quot;Madchester Rave On&quot;, and &quot;Fools Gold&quot;/&quot;What the World is Waiting For&quot; by the Stone Roses. The Happy Mondays record, featuring the lead track &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;, popularized the term &quot;Madchester&quot; – a term that had originally been suggested by their video directors, the Bailey Brothers, as a potential T-shirt slogan, after they coined the word for their abandoned Factory film &quot;The Mad Fuckers&quot;.

In November, the Stone Roses performed a gig at London&#x27;s Alexandra Palace and were invited onto BBC Two&#x27;s high-brow &quot;Late Show&quot; (during their performance, the electricity was cut off by noise-limiting circuitry, and singer Ian Brown shouted, &quot;Amateurs, amateurs,&quot; as the presenter tried to link into the next item). On 23 November 1989, the Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays appeared on the same edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The &quot;Fools Gold&quot; single reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the biggest-selling indie single of the year.

Madchester became something of a bandwagon from this time. According to NME journalist Stuart Maconie, the British press had &quot;gone bonkers over Manchester bands&quot;. James were among the first beneficiaries of this. The local success of their self-financed singles &quot;Come Home&quot; and &quot;Sit Down&quot; led to a deal with Fontana, and they scored chart hits with &quot;How Was It for You&quot; and a re-recorded version of &quot;Come Home&quot; in the summer of 1990.

The Charlatans rose to prominence through appearances in Manchester, particularly as a support act to the Stone Roses, and became strongly associated with the scene. They released their debut single, &quot;Indian Rope,&quot; in October 1989, and their second single, &quot;The Only One I Know,&quot; made the UK top ten. A number of other Manchester bands gained the attention of the music press during 1990, including World of Twist, New Fast Automatic Daffodils, the High, Northside, the Paris Angels, and Intastella. These &quot;second wave&quot; bands, according to John Robb, &quot;copped the critical backlash, but were making great music&quot;. They also received a great deal of local support, with TV appearances on various Granada shows and local radio play.

==Commercial success==
Bands associated with the Madchester scene released material almost exclusively on indie record labels, with the significant exception of James, who signed to Fontana Records in 1989. Madchester was growing in popularity and was no longer just a local trend in Manchester, with an article entitled &quot;Stark Raving Madchester&quot; appearing in &quot;Newsweek Magazine&quot; in 1990, describing the Madchester scene. The main Madchester bands dominated the UK Indie Charts during late 1989 and much of 1990.

The success of several indie acts associated with the &quot;scene&quot; on the UK Singles and Albums charts was unprecedented at the time. &quot;Step On&quot; and &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; by the Happy Mondays both reached number 5 on the singles chart, while James scored the biggest Madchester hit, making number 2 in 1991 with a re-recording of &quot;Sit Down.&quot; On the albums chart, the Happy Mondays reached number 4 with &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot;, and the Inspiral Carpets peaked at number 2 with &quot;Life&quot;. The Charlatans were the only Madchester band to reach the number 1 spot, with the album &quot;Some Friendly&quot; in the autumn of 1990.

Outside the UK, the success of Madchester was limited, although some releases gained recognition in specialist charts around the world. In the U.S., the albums &quot;The Stone Roses&quot;, &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot;, and &quot;Some Friendly&quot; reached the lower echelons of the U.S. albums chart. Several singles by the Stone Roses, the Inspiral Carpets, the Happy Mondays, and the Charlatans performed well on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The Happy Mondays toured the U.S. in 1990 and charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;Step On&quot; reaching No. 57 in 1990. They also reached No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart with &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; in 1990. The only other Madchester artist to reach No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart was the Charlatans, whose single &quot;Weirdo&quot; was No. 1 for the week of 23 May 1992.

==Decline==
On 27 May 1990, the Stone Roses performed at Spike Island in Widnes, supported by DJs Frankie Bones, Dave Haslam, Alfonso Buller (MVITA), Himat &#x27;Chester&#x27; &#x27;The Guru&#x27; Singh (MVITA), and Dave Booth. The concert was described as a &quot;Woodstock for the E generation&quot;. A rapid succession of chart hits followed during the summer, including &quot;One Love&quot; by the Stone Roses, &quot;This Is How It Feels&quot; by the Inspiral Carpets, &quot;The Only One I Know&quot; by the Charlatans, and &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; by the Happy Mondays. The end of the year saw triumphant concerts by James and a double-header with the Happy Mondays and 808 State, both at Manchester G-Mex.

The Stone Roses cancelled their June 1990 tour of America and issued a press statement declaring, &quot;America doesn&#x27;t deserve us yet.&quot; Despite this, their debut album sold more than 350,000 copies in the U.S. that year. The band also canceled a gig in Spain and an appearance on the UK chat show &quot;Wogan&quot;. They did not appear in public again until the end of 1994, spending the intervening time in and out of studios in Wales, where they recorded the album &quot;Second Coming&quot;, while also battling in court to free themselves from their contract with Silvertone Records.

The creation of the next Happy Mondays album, &quot;Yes Please!&quot;, was also troubled, and it would not be released until October 1992. The band flew to Barbados to record it and went &quot;crack crazy,&quot; according to Paul Ryder. They made repeated requests to Factory Records for extra time and additional funds. This is believed to have been a major factor in the bankruptcy of the label in November 1992.

With the two bands considered most central to the scene out of action, media interest in Madchester began to wane. James, the Inspiral Carpets, the Charlatans, and 808 State continued to record with varying degrees of success throughout the 1990s, but they were no longer seen as part of a localized scene. Local bands catching the tail end of Madchester, such as the Mock Turtles, became part of a broader baggy movement. The music press in the UK shifted its focus to shoegazing bands from southern England and the U.S. grunge scene, which was eventually overtaken by Britpop acts like Manchester&#x27;s Oasis and London&#x27;s Blur.

==Legacy==
===Musical legacy===

The immediate influence of Madchester inspired the broader baggy movement in the UK, with bands from various regions of the country producing music in the early 1990s heavily influenced by the key Madchester acts. These bands included Flowered Up (from London), the Farm and the Real People (from Liverpool), the Bridewell Taxis (from Leeds), the Soup Dragons (from Glasgow) and Ocean Colour Scene (from Birmingham). Blur, from Colchester, adopted a baggy style early in their career, although in an interview with &quot;Select Magazine&quot; in 1991, they claimed to have &quot;killed&quot; the genre. Blur famously shared a rivalry throughout the 1990s with fellow Britpop band Oasis, who hailed from Manchester.

Bands formed in Manchester during the Madchester era included the Chemical Brothers, the Verve, Sub Sub (who would later become Doves) and Oasis (Noel Gallagher had been a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets). More broadly, the Madchester scene brought together electronic dance music and alternative rock, particularly the fusion of drumming styles from funk and disco music (and sampled in &#x27;80s hip-hop music) with jingle-jangle guitar. In the 1990s, this became a standard formula, frequently found even in the most commercial music.

Numerous polls have been conducted in the years following the Madchester movement to determine the best song of the era. In 2005, &quot;Voodoo Ray&quot; by A Guy Called Gerald was voted the best song from the Madchester scene. The song triumphed over &quot;Step On&quot; by the Happy Mondays and &quot;Waterfall&quot; by the Stone Roses for first place.

In 2010, a new nightclub managed by Peter Hook of New Order, FAC251, opened in Manchester, with a musical focus on Madchester music. Although the Madchester scene had faded by the mid-1990s, various bands have reformed for one-off concert tours. Notable bands that reformed in 2012 include the Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays and the Inspiral Carpets.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Penny Anderson looked unfavourably upon the scene, describing it as a &quot;breeding ground for aggressively marketed mediocrity&quot;.

The sound of the scene influenced the electronic and dance-influenced album by U2, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. Elysa Gardner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compared the layering of dance beats into guitar-heavy mixes of the album to songs by British bands Happy Mondays and Jesus Jones. &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; combines a funky guitar riff with a danceable, conga-laden beat, for what Bono described as &quot;U2 at our funkiest... Sly and the Family Stone meets Madchester baggy&quot;. It also influenced the Cure&#x27;s song &quot;Never Enough&quot;.

===Impact on Manchester===
The mushrooming of Manchester&#x27;s nightlife during the Madchester period has had a long-term impact, particularly with the subsequent development of the Gay Village and Northern Quarter. City centre living also began to catch on in Manchester in the wake of Madchester, a trend that continues to this day.

The attraction of the city was such that, at the height of Madchester, 

The scene also gave a boost to the city&#x27;s media and creative industries. Channel 4 had already found success with &quot;The Word&quot;, and in its wake, the BBC launched &quot;The 8:15 from Manchester&quot;, a Saturday morning kids&#x27; TV show (with a theme tune by the Inspiral Carpets, a re-write of &quot;Find out Why&quot;). Granada Television also jumped on the bandwagon with a cheaper version of &quot;The Word&quot;, called &quot;Juice&quot;, presented by John Bramwell and Joan Collins&#x27; daughter Tara Newley.

Organised crime became a consequence of Madchester, with the vibrancy of the clubbing scene in the city (and the popularity of illegal drugs, particularly ecstasy) creating a fertile environment for opportunist gangsterism. Violent incidents at the Haçienda led to a campaign against it by Greater Manchester Police, which contributed to its closure in 1997.

In the late 1990s, a Manchester musical walk of fame was commissioned for Oldham Street in the Northern Quarter of Manchester. The walk includes a triangular slab for each music group and pays homage to bands such as the Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, the Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, and James.

A blue plaque marks the site of The Boardwalk, another club central to the Madchester scene, where Oasis played their first gig and Dave Haslam hosted the Yellow club night until the club&#x27;s closure in 1999. It reads &quot;Madchester venue nightclub and rehearsal rooms&quot; and features a yellow smiley face beneath. Funkademia, a club night that began at the Boardwalk in 1995, is still held at the Mint Lounge in the Northern Quarter.

<doc id="226479" wikidata="Q13527031" url="?curid=226479" title="Shandy">
<text>Shandy is beer or cider mixed with a lemon flavoured beverage, often lemonade, usually half lemonade and half beer or cider, resulting in a lower ABV for the finished drink. Shandies are popular in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Caribbean, and Canada.

In some jurisdictions, the low alcohol content of shandies exempts them from laws governing the sale of alcoholic beverages.

== Etymology ==

The debated origin of the term (recorded first in 1888) is shortened from &quot;shandygaff&quot;, from Britain in 1853 and itself of obscure source.

&quot;Shandy&quot; is a popular drink in UK and is usually ordered as either &quot;bitter shandy&quot; (50/50 bitter beer and fizzy clear lemonade) or &quot;lager shandy&quot; in which lager is substituted for the ale.

== Variants by name ==

=== Radler ===

&quot;Radler&quot; (, lit. German for &#x27;cyclist&#x27;) has a long history in German-speaking regions. It commonly consists of a 50:50 mixture of beer and a lemon-flavoured soft drink.

The term &quot;Radler&quot; originates with a drink called &quot;Radlermass&quot; (&#x27;cyclist litre&#x27;) that was created by innkeeper Franz Kugler in the small town of Deisenhofen, just outside Munich. During the great cycling boom of the Roaring Twenties, Kugler created a bicycle trail from Munich through the woods that led directly to his drinking establishment.

While the term &quot;Radler&quot; has been widely attributed to Kugler, the combination of beer and soft drink is documented in texts dating from 1912. &quot;Radler&quot; is consumed not only in Bavaria, but also in other parts of Germany, Austria, Czechia, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Poland, Portugal, Netherlands, Norway, Bulgaria, the United States, Canada, and Romania.

In northern Germany, a half-and-half mix of Pilsner beer and soft drink is known as an &quot;Alster&quot; (short for &quot;Alsterwasser&quot;, , German for &#x27;water from the Alster&#x27;, a river in Hamburg). Regionally the &quot;Radler&quot; and &quot;Alster&quot; may refer to shandies made with either citrus or orange flavoured softdrinks, with the two terms either contrasting or referring to the same drink. In Austria, a &quot;saure Radler&quot; is a mix of lager and soda water.

In Austria, a variant, sometimes called Almradler, is popular, using Almdudler instead of lemonade. &quot;Radler&quot; is very popular during the summer months due to its low alcohol content and reputation for being a &quot;thirst-quencher&quot;.

In New Zealand, the word &quot;radler&quot; was trademarked by DB Breweries for their &quot;Monteith&#x27;s &quot;Radler&quot;&quot; beer, which is a citrus-flavoured, full-strength (5%) beer. This has led to some brewers to use the names &quot;reldar&quot; (&quot;Radler&quot; spelled backwards) and &quot;Cyclist&quot; (the literal meaning of &quot;Radler&quot;).

In the Netherlands, shandy and Radler are largely seen as two different drinks, shandy being a 0.5% alcohol drink popular as a children&#x27;s drink during the 70s, as beverages not exceeding 0.5% alcohol were officially seen as non-alcoholic. The classic German Radler, for a decade or so, has also been sold as a pre-mixed drink of increasing popularity by most large Dutch beer brewers in a growing number of varieties.

=== Russ ===

In Bavaria, the southeastern state of Germany, as well as in the countryside of Austria, a mix of 50% &quot;Weißbier&quot; and 50% lemonade is called a &quot;Russ&quot;. There are three different theories about the origin of this name:

* Due to a shortage of raw materials that occurred during the great inflation between 1921 and 1923, Weißbier became more popular. To further reduce material efforts, the Weißbier was thinned with lemonade. The name &quot;Russ&quot; may derive from the popularity of the drink among Russian workers in Germany at that time.
* Another theory of the name&#x27;s origin is that the drink initially was called &quot;Riesen-Maß&quot; &quot;(Riesen = giant)&quot;, as the drink mixture frothed heavily.
* The most popular theory is that the drink was first served in the Mathäser-Keller in Munich after the 1918 Revolution when Communists came together.

=== Shandygaff ===

A &quot;Shandygaff&quot; is an older British name for beer mixed with ginger beer or ginger ale; the earliest written record of the word dates back to 1853. In H. G. Wells’ comic novel &quot;The History of Mr Polly&quot;, Wells refers to Shandygaff as &quot;two bottles of beer mixed with ginger beer in a round-bellied jug&quot;.

=== Lager top ===

In England, Wales and Scotland, a lager top is a lager with a dash of lemonade on top, the latter of which reduces the lager&#x27;s hardness.

=== Panaché ===

In France, Switzerland and parts of Italy, a mix of beer and soda (Sprite) is called a Panaché. This name was also adopted in Portugal due to the influence of French culture in the area.

=== Monaco ===

In France, a 50/50 mix of lager and carbonated lemonade with a dash of Grenadine is called a Monaco.

=== Clara ===

In Spain, a &quot;clara&quot; is typically any mixture of beer with a sweet-tasting carbonated soft drink (in order to reduce the bitterness of the hops). The addition of soda lightens the color of the beer, hence its name (clara means &quot;clear&quot; in Spanish). It is usually served as a refreshment in the hot summer months, being a very popular drink. Other regions have different names for the mixture, and there is a debate over whether a clara refers to beer with lemon, or beer with a soft drink.

=== CARIB Shandy ===

On the Caribbean island(s) of Trinidad and Tobago, the CARIB brewery offers shandy lager in three flavors ... ginger, sorrel (hibiscus), and lime.

<text>This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1601.

==Events==
*January 1 – The &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boys&quot;, a children&#x27;s drama group, perform at the English royal court.
*January 6 – The Children of the Chapel give their first theatrical performance at the English court since 1584: &quot;Liberality and Prodigality&quot;, by an unknown dramatist. 
*January 21 – Tirso de Molina enters the monastery of San Antolín at Guadalajara, Spain.
*February 7 – The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men stage a performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; at the Globe Theatre in London. The performance is specially commissioned (at a 40-shilling bonus) by the plotters in the Earl of Essex&#x27;s rebellion of the following day. The plotters hope that the play, depicting the overthrow of a reigning monarch, will influence the public mood in their favour. The plot fails.
*February 17 – Actor Augustine Phillips, a member of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, is deposed by the Privy Council of England.
*Spring – Probable latest date for first performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The play is presented by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men at the Globe Theatre in London with Richard Burbage playing Prince Hamlet and (according to theatrical tradition) the dramatist playing the Ghost.
*May 31 – The authorities demand proof of the insanity of Tommaso Campanella, imprisoned in Italy for revolutionary plotting; Campanella is eventually judged insane and spared the death penalty and sentenced to life imprisonment, in the course of which he writes &quot;The City of the Sun&quot;.
*June (approximate) – Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Poetaster&quot; is performed on stage for the first time.
*July – Lancelot Andrewes becomes Dean of Westminster.
*&quot;unknown dates&quot;
**Thomas Overbury meets Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, and they become firm friends.
**Philemon Holland publishes his translation of the &quot;Natural History&quot; of Pliny the Elder. When he composes &quot;Othello&quot; in the next year or so, Shakespeare exploits the book for references, including the &quot;Anthropophagi&quot; and the &quot;Pontic Sea.&quot;

<doc id="226497" wikidata="Q1390959" url="?curid=226497" title="The Haçienda">
<text>The Haçienda was a nightclub and music venue in Manchester, England, which became famous during the Madchester years of the 1980s and early 1990s. It was run by the record label Factory Records.

The club opened in 1982, eventually fostering the Manchester acid house and rave scene in the late 1980s. The early success of Factory band New Order, particularly with their 1983 dance hit &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, helped to subsidise the club even as it lost considerable amounts of money (in part due to clubbers&#x27; embrace of the street drug ecstasy, which drove down traditional alcohol sales).

The club&#x27;s subculture was noted by the Chief Constables of Merseyside and Greater Manchester as reducing football hooliganism. Crime and financial troubles plagued its later years, and it finally closed in 1997. It was subsequently demolished and replaced by apartments.

== Creation ==

The former warehouse occupied by the club was at 11–13 Whitworth Street West on the south side of the Rochdale Canal: the frontage was curved and built of red Accrington brick. Before it was turned into a club, the Haçienda was a yacht builder&#x27;s shop and warehouse.

It was conceived by Rob Gretton, and largely financed by the record label Factory Records, the band New Order, and label boss Tony Wilson. It was on the corner of Whitworth Street West and Albion Street, close to Castlefield, on the edge of the city centre. FAC 51 was its official designation in the Factory catalogue. New Order, Tony Wilson and Howard (Ginger) Jones were directors of the club.

Designed by Ben Kelly, upon recommendation by Factory graphic designer Peter Saville, upstairs consisted of a stage, dance area, bar, cloakroom, cafeteria area and balcony with a DJ booth. Downstairs was a cocktail bar called &quot;The Gay Traitor&quot;, which referred to Anthony Blunt, a British art historian who spied for the Soviet Union. The two other bars, &quot;The Kim Philby&quot; and &quot;Hicks&quot;, were named after Blunt&#x27;s fellow spies. From 1995 onwards, the lower cellar areas of the venue were converted to create the 5th Man, a smaller music venue. Classics nights and private parties were held in the 5th man and local DJ Roy Baxter from Eccles was a resident warm up DJ handing over to the likes of Nipper and Jon Dasilva.

The sound and lighting design and installation for the Haçienda was done by Martin Disney Associates and later by Eddie Akka from Akwil Ltd.

===Name===
The name comes from a slogan of the radical group Situationist International: &quot;The Hacienda Must Be Built&quot;, from &quot;Formulary for a New Urbanism&quot; by Ivan Chtcheglov. A &quot;hacienda&quot; is a large homestead in a ranch or estate usually in places where Colonial Spanish culture has had architectural influence. Even though the cedilla is not used in Spanish, the spelling &quot;Haçienda&quot; was decided on for the club because the cedilla makes the &quot;çi&quot; resemble &quot;51&quot;, the club&#x27;s catalogue number.

==History==

The Haçienda was opened on 21 May 1982, when the comedian Bernard Manning remarked to the audience, &quot;I&#x27;ve played some shit-holes during my time, but this is really something&quot;. His jokes did not go down well with the crowd and he returned his fee.

A wide range of musical acts appeared at the club. One of the earliest was the German EBM band Liaisons Dangereuses, which played there on 7 July 1982. The Smiths performed there three times in 1983. It served as a venue for Madonna on her first performance in the United Kingdom, where the renowned music photographer Kevin Cummins took photos of the evening on 27 January 1984. She was invited to appear as part of a one-off, live television broadcast by Channel 4 music programme &quot;The Tube &quot;with then-resident Haçienda DJ Greg Wilson live mixing on the show&quot;.&quot; Madonna performed &quot;Holiday&quot; whilst at the Haçienda and the performance was described by Norman Cook (better known as Fatboy Slim) as one that &quot;mesmerised the crowd&quot;.

At one time, the venue also included a hairdressing salon. As well as club nights there were regular concerts, including one in which Einstürzende Neubauten drilled into the walls that surrounded the stage. The venue was instrumental in the careers of Happy Mondays, Oasis, the Stone Roses, 808 State, Chemical Brothers and Sub Sub.

In 1986, it became one of the first British clubs to start playing house music, with DJs Hewan Clarke, Greg Wilson and later Mike Pickering (of Quando Quango and M People) and Little Martin (later with Graeme Park) hosting the visionary &quot;Nude&quot; night on Fridays. This night quickly became legendary, and helped to turn around the reputation and fortunes of the Haçienda, which went from making a consistent loss to being full every night of the week by early 1987.

===Acid house and rave===
The growth of the &#x27;Madchester&#x27; scene had little to do with the healthy house music scene in Manchester at the time but it was boosted by the success of the Haçienda&#x27;s pioneering Ibiza night, &quot;Hot&quot;, an acid house night hosted by Pickering and Jon Dasilva in July 1988.

However, drug use became a problem. On 14 July 1989, the UK&#x27;s first ecstasy-related death occurred at the club; 16-year-old Clare Leighton collapsed and died after her boyfriend gave her an ecstasy tablet. The police clampdown that followed was opposed by Manchester City Council, which argued that the club contributed to an &quot;active use of the city centre core&quot; in line with the government&#x27;s policy of regenerating urban areas. The resulting problems caused the club to close for a short period in early 1991, before reopening with increased security later the same year.

Haçienda DJs made regular and guest appearances on radio and TV shows like Granada TV&#x27;s &quot;Juice&quot;, Sunset 102 and BBC Radio 1. Between 1994 and 1997, &quot;Hacienda FM&quot; was a weekly show on Manchester dance station Kiss 102.

Security was frequently a problem, particularly in the club&#x27;s latter years. There were several shootings inside and outside the club, and relations with the police and licensing authorities became troubled. When local magistrates and police visited the club in 1997, they witnessed a near-fatal assault on a man in the streets outside when 18-year-old Andrew Delahunty was hit over the head from behind with what looked like a metal bar before being pushed into the path of an oncoming car.

Although security failures at the club were one of the contributing factors to the club eventually closing, the most likely cause was its finances. The club simply did not make enough money from the sale of alcohol, and this was mainly because many patrons instead turned to drug use. As a result, the club rarely broke even as alcohol sales are the main source of income for nightclubs. Ultimately, the club&#x27;s long-term future was crippled and, with spiralling debts, the Haçienda eventually closed definitively in the summer of 1997. Peter Hook stated in 2009 that the Haçienda lost up to £18 million in its latter years.

==Legacy==

The Haçienda lost its entertainments licence in June 1997. The last night of the club was 28 June 1997, a club night called &quot;Freak&quot; featuring Elliot Eastwick and Dave Haslam (the final live performance was by Spiritualized on 15 June 1997). The club remained open for a short period as an art gallery before finally going bankrupt and closing for good. After the Haçienda officially closed, it was used as a venue for two free parties organised by the Manchester free party scene. One of the parties ended in a police siege of the building while the party continued inside. These parties resulted in considerable damage and the application of graffiti to the Ben Kelly-designed interior.

Following a number of years standing empty, the Whitworth Street West site was purchased from the receivers by Crosby Homes. They chose to demolish the nightclub, and reuse the site for the construction of apartments. The old name was kept for the new development, with the Haçienda name licensed from Peter Hook, who owns the name and trademark. The nightclub was demolished in 2002—Crosby Homes had acquired the property some time before that and, on 25 November 2000, had held a charity auction of the various fixtures and fittings from the nightclub. Clubgoers and enthusiasts from across the country attended to buy memorabilia ranging from the DJ booth box and radiators to emergency exit lights. The DJ booth was bought by Bobby Langley, ex-Haçienda DJ and Head of Merchandise for Sony Music London for an undisclosed fee.

Crosby Homes were widely criticised for using the Haçienda brand name—and featuring the strapline &quot;Now the party&#x27;s over...you can come home&quot; in the promotional material. Another controversial feature of the branding campaign was the appropriation of many of the themes which ran through the original building. One of these was the yellow and black hazard stripe motif which was a powerful element in the club&#x27;s original design, featuring as it did on the club&#x27;s dominant supporting pillars and later in much of the club&#x27;s literature and flyers.

Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; starring Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson, tells the story of the Haçienda. The film was shot in 2001, and required reconstructing the Haçienda as a temporary set in a Manchester factory, which was then opened to ticket holders for a night, acting as a full-scale nightclub (except with free bar) as the film shooting took place.

The Manchester exhibition centre Urbis hosted an exhibition celebrating the 25th anniversary of the club&#x27;s opening, which ran from mid-July 2007 until mid-February 2008. Peter Hook and many other of those originally involved contributed or loaned material.

The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry now holds a variety of Haçienda and Factory Records artefacts, including the main loading bay doors from the club, and a wide array of posters, fliers and props. Rob Gretton bequeathed his collection of Haçienda memorabilia to the museum.

In October 2009, Peter Hook published his book on his time as co-owner of the Haçienda, &quot;How Not to Run a Club&quot;. In 2010, Peter Hook had six bass guitars made using wood from the Haçienda&#x27;s dancefloor. The fretboards have been made from dance floor planks, so they have &quot;stiletto marks and cigarette burns&quot;.

<doc id="226498" wikidata="Q3312138" url="?curid=226498" title="Convection cell">
<text>In fluid dynamics, a convection cell is the phenomenon that occurs when density differences exist within a body of liquid or gas. These density differences result in rising and/or falling convection currents, which are the key characteristics of a convection cell. When a volume of fluid is heated, it expands and becomes less dense and thus more buoyant than the surrounding fluid. The colder, denser part of the fluid descends to settle below the warmer, less-dense fluid, and this causes the warmer fluid to rise. Such movement is called convection, and the moving body of liquid is referred to as a &quot;convection cell&quot;. This particular type of convection, where a horizontal layer of fluid is heated from below, is known as Rayleigh–Bénard convection. Convection usually requires a gravitational field, but in microgravity experiments, thermal convection has been observed without gravitational effects.

Fluids are generalized as materials that exhibit the property of flow; however, this behavior is not unique to liquids. Fluid properties can also be observed in gases and even in particulate solids (such as sand, gravel, and larger objects during rock slides).

A convection cell is most notable in the formation of clouds with its release and transportation of energy. As air moves along the ground it absorbs heat, loses density and moves up into the atmosphere. When it is forced into the atmosphere, which has a lower air pressure, it cannot contain as much fluid as at a lower altitude, so it releases its moist air, producing rain. In this process the warm air is cooled; it gains density and falls towards the earth and the cell repeats the cycle.

Convection cells can form in any fluid, including the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (where they are called Hadley cells), boiling water, soup (where the cells can be identified by the particles they transport, such as grains of rice), the ocean, or the surface of the Sun. The size of convection cells is largely determined by the fluid&#x27;s properties. Convection cells can even occur when the heating of a fluid is uniform.

==Process==
A rising body of fluid typically loses heat when it encounters a cold surface when it exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange, or in the example of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, when it radiates heat. At some point, the fluid becomes denser than the fluid beneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side. At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again through surface contact or conductivity and the cycle repeats.

==Within the Earth&#x27;s troposphere==

===Thunderstorms===
Warm air has a lower density than cool air, so warm air rises within cooler air, similar to hot air balloons. Clouds form as relatively warmer air carrying moisture rises within cooler air. As the moist air rises, it cools, causing some of the water vapor in the rising packet of air to condense. When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as the latent heat of vaporisation, which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than its surrounding air, continuing the cloud&#x27;s ascension. If enough instability is present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form, which support lightning and thunder. Generally, thunderstorms require three conditions to form: moisture, an unstable air mass, and a lifting force (heat).

All thunderstorms, regardless of type, go through three stages: a &#x27;developing stage&#x27;, a &#x27;mature stage&#x27;, and a &#x27;dissipating stage&#x27;. The average thunderstorm has a diameter. Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through.

===Adiabatic processes===
Heating caused by the compression of descending air is responsible for such winter phenomena as the chinook (as it is known in western North America) or the Föhn (in the Alps).
== Within the Sun ==
The Sun&#x27;s photosphere is composed of convection cells called &quot;granules&quot;, which are rising columns of superheated (5,800 °C) plasma averaging about 1,000 kilometres in diameter. The plasma cools as it rises and descends in the narrow spaces between the granules.

<text>Beaujolais ( , ) is a French &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) wine in the Burgundy region. Beaujolais wines are generally made of the Gamay grape, which has a thin skin and is low in tannin, but like most AOC wines they are not labeled varietally. Whites from the region, which make up only 1% of its production, are made mostly with Chardonnay grapes though Aligoté is also permitted until 2024 (on condition the vines were planted before 2004). Beaujolais tends to be a very light-bodied red wine, with relatively high amounts of acidity. In some vintages, Beaujolais produces more wine than the Burgundy wine regions of Chablis, Côte d&#x27;Or, Côte Chalonnaise and Mâconnais put together.

The wine takes its name from the historical Province of Beaujolais, a wine-producing region. It is located north of Lyon, and covers parts of the north of the department of Rhône, the Rhône-Alpes region and southern areas of the department of Saône-et-Loire, in Burgundy. While administratively considered part of the Burgundy wine region, the climate is closer to that of the Rhône, and the wine is sufficiently individual in character to be considered apart from Burgundy and Rhône. The region is known internationally for its long tradition of winemaking, for the use of carbonic maceration, and more recently for the popular Beaujolais nouveau.

==History==
The region of Beaujolais was first cultivated by the Romans who planted the areas along its trading route up the Saône valley. The most noticeable Roman vineyard was &quot;Brulliacus&quot; located on the hillside of Mont Brouilly. The Romans also planted vineyards in the area around Morgon. From the 7th century through the Middle Ages, most of the viticulture and winemaking was done by the Benedictine monks. In the 10th century, the region got its name from the town of Beaujeu, Rhône and was ruled by the Lords of Beaujeu until the 15th century when it was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy. The wines from Beaujolais were mostly confined to the markets along the Saône and Rhône, particularly in the town of Lyon. The expansion of the French railroad system in the 19th century opened up the lucrative Paris market. The first mention of Beaujolais wines in English followed soon after when Cyrus Redding described the wines of Moulin-à-Vent and Saint-Amour as being low-priced and best consumed young.

In the 1980s, Beaujolais hit a peak of popularity in the world&#x27;s wine market with its Beaujolais nouveau wine. Spurred on by the creative marketing from wine merchants such as Georges Duboeuf, demand outpaced supply for the easy-drinking, fruity wines. As more Beaujolais producers tried to capitalize on the &quot;Nouveau craze&quot;, production of regular Beaujolais dropped and an eventual backlash occurred in the late 1990s and early 21st century. By this point, the whole of Beaujolais wine had developed a negative reputation among consumers who associated Gamay based wines with the slightly sweet, simple light bodied wines that characterized Beaujolais Nouveau. Producers were left with a wine surplus that French authorities compelled them to reduce through mandatory distillation. In response, there has been renewed emphasis on the production of more complex wines that are aged longer in oak barrels prior to release. Recent years have seen a rise in the number of terroir driven estate-bottled wines made from single vineyards or in one of the Cru Beaujolais communes, where the name of the commune is allowed to be displayed on the label.

===Gamay grape===
Gamay noir is now known to be a cross of pinot noir and the ancient white variety Gouais, the latter a Central European variety that was probably introduced to northeastern France by the Romans. The grape brought relief to the village growers following the decline of the Black Death. In contrast to the pinot noir, Gamay ripened two weeks earlier and was less difficult to cultivate. It also produced a strong, fruitier wine in a much larger abundance. In July 1395, the Duke of Burgundy, Philippe the Bold, outlawed the cultivation of Gamay as being &quot;a very bad and disloyal plant&quot;, due in part to the variety occupying land that could be used for the more &quot;elegant&quot; pinot noir. Sixty years later, Philippe the Good issued another edict against Gamay, in which he stated that the reason for the ban was because &quot;[t]he Dukes of Burgundy are known as the lords of the best wines in Christendom. We will maintain our reputation&quot;. The edicts had the effect of pushing Gamay plantings southward, out of the main region of Burgundy and into the granite-based soils of Beaujolais, where the grape thrived.

===Scandals===
Following the 2001 vintage, over 1.1 million cases of Beaujolais wine (most of it Beaujolais Nouveau) had to be destroyed or distilled due to lackluster sales as part of a consumer backlash against the popularity of Beaujolais Nouveau. In an interview given to local newspaper &quot;Lyon Mag&quot;, French wine critic François Mauss claimed that the reason for the backlash was the poor quality of Beaujolais Nouveau that had flooded the market in recent decades. He claimed that Beaujolais producers had long ignored the warning signs that such a backlash was coming and continued to produce what Mauss termed &quot;vin de merde&quot; (&quot;shit wine&quot;). This triggered an outcry among Beaujolais producers, followed by an association of 56 cooperative producers filing a lawsuit against &quot;Lyon Mag&quot; for publishing Mauss&#x27;s comments.

Rather than sue for libel, the producers sued under an obscure French law that punishes the denigration of French products. In January 2003, the court in Villefranche-sur-Saône found in favor of the Beaujolais producers and awarded USD$350,000, which would have put the small employee-owned publication out of business. The bad publicity garnered from the &quot;shit wine case&quot; was extensive, with several publications such as &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; running critical or satirical articles in response to the court&#x27;s decision. In 2005, the highest court of appeal reversed the decision and found that there was no cause for action against the publication; the Beaujolais winemakers were ordered to pay €2,000 (US$2,442) in court costs to &quot;Lyon Mag&quot;.

In 2005, the &quot;Vins Georges Duboeuf&quot; company was charged with mixing low-grade wine with better vintages after a patchy 2004 harvest. Georges Duboeuf denied wrongdoing, blaming human error and pointing out that none of the affected wine was released to consumers. The production manager directly responsible admitted his actions and resigned, and a court found that both &quot;fraud and attempted fraud concerning the origin and quality of wines&quot; had been committed. Fewer than 200,000 liters of the company&#x27;s annual 270 million liter production were implicated, but &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Duboeuf&quot;, as it was called, was considered a serious scandal.

In December 2007, five people were arrested after reportedly selling nearly 600 tonnes of sugar to growers in Beaujolais. Up to 100 growers were accused of using the sugar for illegal chaptalization and also of exceeding volume quotas between 2004 and 2006.

==Climate and geography==

Beaujolais is a large wine-producing region, larger than any single district of Burgundy. There are over of vines planted in a stretch of land that is between 7 and wide (11 to 14 km). The historical capital of the province is Beaujeu (&quot;Bôjor&quot; / &quot;Biôjœr&quot; in Arpitan) and the economic capital of the area is Villefranche-sur-Saône (&quot;Velafranche&quot;). Many of Beaujolais vineyards are found in the hillside on the outskirt of Lyons in the eastern portion of the region along the Saône valley. The Massif Central is located to the west and has a tempering influence on Beaujolais&#x27; climate. The region is located south of the Burgundy wine region Mâconnais with nearly 100 &quot;communes&quot; in the northern region of Beaujolais overlapping between the AOC boundaries Beaujolais and the Maconnais region of Saint-Véran.

The climate of Beaujolais is semi-continental with some temperate influences. The proximity of the Mediterranean Sea does impart some Mediterranean influence on the climate. The region is overall, warmer than Burgundy with vines that consistently fully ripen grapes. By the time that the Beaujolais Nouveau is released in late November, the foothills in the western regions will have normally seen snow. A common viticultural hazard is spring time frost.

The soils of Beaujolais divide the region into a northern and southern half, with the town of Villefranche serving as a near dividing point. The northern half of Beaujolais, where most of the Cru Beaujolais communes are located, includes rolling hills of schist and granite based soils with some limestone. On hillsides, most of the granite and schist is found in the upper slopes with the lower slopes having more stone and clay composition. The southern half of the region, also known as the &quot;Bas Beaujolais&quot;, has flatter terrain with richer, sandstone and clay based soils with some limestone patches. The Gamay grape fares differently in both regions-producing more structured, complex wines in the north and lighter, fruitier wines in the south. The angle of the hillside vineyards in the north exposes the grapes to more sunshine which leads to harvest at an earlier time than the vineyards in the south.

==Appellations==

The new rules for Beaujolais appellations were issued by INAO in 2011
There are 12 main appellations of Beaujolais wines covering the production of more than 96 villages in the Beaujolais region. They were originally established in 1936, with additional crus being promoted in 1938 and 1946, plus Régnié in 1988. About half of all Beaujolais wine is sold under the basic Beaujolais AOC designation. The majority of this wine is produced in the southern &quot;Bas Beaujolais&quot; region located around the town of Belleville. The minimum natural alcohol level for the grapes is 10%, and the maximum yield is 60 hl/ha (65 hl/ha for a bumper crop) The wine may be labeled as &quot;Beaujolais Supérieur&quot; in case the minimum natural alcohol level for the grapes is 10,5%, and the maximum yield is 58 hl/ha (63 hl/ha for a bumper crop). Exactly the same limits are effective for &quot;Beaujolais-Villages&quot;. Maximum chaptalization levels are established at 3 g/L (glucose + fructose).

* is the most extended appellation allowed to be used in any of the 96 villages, but essentially covering 60 villages, and refers to all basic Beaujolais wines. A large portion of the wine produced under this appellation is sold as Beaujolais Nouveau. Annually, this appellation averages around 75 million bottles a year in production. Maximum level of sulfur dioxide in the Nouveau is limited at 100 mg/L.
*, the intermediate category in terms of classification, covers 39 communes/villages in the Haut Beaujolais, the northern part of the region accounting for a quarter of production. Some is sold as Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau, but it is not common. Most of the wines are released in the following March after the harvest. The terrain of this region is hillier with more schist and granite soil composition than what is found in the regions of the Beaujolais AOC and the wine has the potential to be of higher quality. If the grapes come from the area of a single vineyard or &quot;commune&quot;, producers can affix the name of their particular village to the Beaujolais-Villages designation. Since most of the villages of Beaujolais, outside of those classified as Cru Beaujolais, villages have little international name recognitions most producers choose to maintain the Beaujolais-Villages designation. The maximum permitted yields for this AOC is 58 hl/ha. These wines are meant to be consumed young, within two years of their harvest. Several of the communes in the Beaujolais-Villages AOC also qualify to produce their wines under the Mâconnais and Saint-Véran AOCs. The Beaujolais producers that produce a red wine under the Beaujolais-Villages appellation will often produce their white wine under the more internationally recognized names of Mâcon-Villages or Saint-Véran.
*Cru Beaujolais, the highest category of classification in Beaujolais, account for the production within ten villages/areas in the foothills of the Beaujolais mountains. Unlike Burgundy and Alsace, the phrase &quot;cru&quot; in Beaujolais refers to an entire wine-producing area rather than an individual vineyard. Seven of the Crus relate to actual villages while Brouilly and Côte de Brouilly refer to the vineyards areas around Mont Brouilly and Moulin-à-Vent is named for a local windmill. These wines do not usually show the word &quot;Beaujolais&quot; on the label, in an attempt to separate themselves from mass-produced Nouveau; in fact vineyards in the cru villages are not allowed to produce Nouveau. The maximum yields for Cru Beaujolais wine is 48 hl/ha. Their wines can be more full-bodied, darker in color, and significantly longer-lived. From north to south the Beaujolais crus are- Saint-Amour, Juliénas, Chénas, Moulin-à-Vent, Fleurie, Chiroubles, Morgon, Régnié, Brouilly and Côte de Brouilly.
*Beaujolais Blanc &amp; Beaujolais Rosé – A small amount of white wine made from Chardonnay is grown in the region and used to produce Beaujolais Blanc or Beaujolais-Villages Blanc. The vineyards to produces these wines are normally found in the limestone soils of the far northern extremities of the region. Part of the reason for the small production of these wines is that many of the vineyards overlap into the Mâconnais regions and producers will usually choose to label their wines under the more marketable and well known Mâcon Blanc designation. There is also regulations in several Beaujolais &quot;communes&quot; restricting growers to dedicating no more than 10% of their vineyard space to white wine grape varieties. Beaujolais Rosé made from Gamay is permitted in the Beaujolais AOC but is rarely produced.

===Beaujolais crus===
The 10 Beaujolais crus differ in character. The following three crus produce the lightest-bodied Beaujolais and are typically intended to be consumed within three years of the vintage.

* – The largest cru in Beaujolais, situated around Mont Brouilly and containing within its boundaries the sub-district of Côte de Brouilly. The wines are noted for their aromas of blueberries, cherries, raspberries and currants. Along with Côte de Brouilly, this is the only Cru Beaujolais region that permits grapes other than Gamay to be produced in the area with vineyards growing Chardonnay, Aligote and Melon de Bourgogne as well. The Brouilly cru also contains the famous &quot;Pisse Vieille&quot; vineyard (roughly translated as &quot;piss old woman!&quot;) which received its name from a local legend of a devout Catholic woman who misheard the local priest&#x27;s absolution to &quot;&quot;Allez! Et ne péchez plus.&quot; (Go! And sin no more.) as &quot;Allez! Et ne pissez plus.&quot;&quot; (Go! And piss no more). The vineyard name is the admonishment that her husband gave to her upon learning of the priest&#x27;s words.
* - The most recently recognized cru, graduating from a Beaujolais-Villages area to Cru Beaujolais in 1988. One of the more full-bodied crus in this category. It is noted for its redcurrant and raspberry flavors. Local lore in the region states that this cru was the site of the first vineyards planted in Beaujolais by the Romans.
* – This cru has vineyards at some of the highest altitudes among the Cru Beaujolais. Chiroubles cru are noted for their delicate perfume that often includes aromas of violets.

The next three crus produce more medium bodied Cru Beaujolais that Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan recommends needs at least a year aging in the bottle and to be consumed within four years of the vintage.

* – Located on the higher slopes of the extinct volcano Mont Brouilly within the Brouilly Cru Beaujolais. The wines from this region are more deeply concentrated with less earthiness than Brouilly wine.
* – One of the most widely exported Cru Beaujolais into the United States. These wines often have a velvet texture with fruity and floral bouquet. In ideal vintages, a &quot;vin de garde&quot; (wine for aging) is produced that is meant to age at least four years before consuming and can last up to 16 years.
* – Local lore suggest that this region was named after a Roman soldier (St. Amateur) who converted to Christianity after escaping death and established a mission near the area. The wines from Saint-Amour are noted for their spicy flavors with aromas of peaches. The &quot;vin de garde&quot; wines require at least four year aging and can last up to 12 years.

The last four crus produce the fullest bodied examples of Cru Beaujolais that need the most time ageing in the bottle and are usually meant to be consumed between four and 10 years after harvest.
* – Once contained many of the vineyards that are now sold under the Moulin-à-Vent designation. It is now the smallest Cru Beaujolais with wines that are noted for their aroma of wild roses. In ideal vintages, a &quot;vin de garde&quot; is produced that is meant to age at least five years before consuming and last up to 15. The area named is derived from the forest of French oak trees &quot;(chêne)&quot; that used to dot the hillside.
*Juliénas – This cru is centered on the village named after Julius Caesar. The wines made from this area are noted for their richness and spice with aromas reminiscent of peonies. In contrast to the claims of Régnié, Juliénas growers believe that this area was the site of the first vineyards planted in Beaujolais by the Romans during their conquest of Gaul.
* – Produces earthy wines that can take on a Burgundian character of silky texture after five years aging. These wines are generally the deepest color and most rich Cru Beaujolais with aromas of apricots and peaches. Within this cru there is a particular hillside, known as Côte du Py, in the center of Morgon that produces the most powerful examples of Morgon wines.
*Moulin-à-Vent – Wines are very similar to the nearby Chénas Cru Beaujolais. This region produces some of the longest-lasting examples of Beaujolais wine, with some wines lasting up to 10 years. Some producers will age their Moulin-à-Vent in oak which gives these wines more tannin and structure than other Beaujolais wines. The phrase &quot;fûts de chêne&quot; (oak casks) will sometimes appear on the wine label of these oak aged wines. The region is noted for the high level of manganese that is in the soil, which can be toxic to grape vines in high levels. The level of toxicity in Moulin-à-Vent does not kill the vine but is enough to cause chlorosis and alter the vine&#x27;s metabolism to reduce yields severely. The resulting wines from Moulin-à-Vent are the most full bodied and powerful examples in Beaujolais. The &quot;vin de garde&quot; styles require at least six years aging and can last up to 20 years.

===Beaujolais nouveau===
The early history of Beaujolais nouveau can trace its roots to 19th century when the first wines of the vintage were sent down the Saône to the early bistros of Lyon. Upon their arrival signs would be put out proclaiming &quot;Le Beaujolais Est Arrivé!&quot; and its consumption was seen as a celebration of another successful harvest. In the 1960s, this style of simple Beaujolais became increasingly popular worldwide with more than half a million cases of it being sold. In 1985 the &quot;Institut National des Appellations d&#x27;Origine&quot; (INAO) established the third Thursday of November to allow for a uniform release date for the wine. Wines are typically shipped a few days earlier to locations around the world where they must be held in a bonded warehouse till 12:01am, when the wines can be first opened and consumed.

Today, about a third of the region&#x27;s production is sold as Beaujolais nouveau, a marketing name created by Georges Duboeuf for the local &quot;vin de l&#x27;année&quot;. It is the lightest, fruitiest style of Beaujolais and meant for simple quaffing. Any Beaujolais or Beaujolais-Villages AOC vineyard can produce Beaujolais nouveau. The grapes are harvested between late August and early September. It is fermented for just a few days and released to the public on the third Thursday of November – &quot;Beaujolais Nouveau Day&quot;. It is the first French wine to be released for each vintage year. In 1992, at its peak, more than half of all Beaujolais wine was sold as &quot;Beaujolais nouveau&quot;. The wines are meant to be drunk as young as possible, when they are at their freshest and fruitiest. They can last up to one or two years but will have lost most of their characteristic flavors by that point.

==Viticulture and grape varieties==
The Beaujolais region has one of the highest vine density ratios of any major worldwide wine region, with anywhere from 9000 to 13,000 vines per hectare. Most vines are trained in the traditional gobelet style, where the spurs of the vines are pushed upwards and arranged in a circle, resembling a chalice. This method has its roots in the Roman style of vine training and has only recently begun to fall out of favor for the guyot method which involves taking a single or double spur and training it out horizontally. Harvest usually occurs in late September and is almost universally done by hand rather than with the use of mechanical harvesters. This is because the Beaujolais wine-making style of carbonic maceration utilizes whole bunches of grape clusters that normally get broken and separated by a mechanical harvester.

The Gamay grape, more accurately known as Gamay noir à Jus blanc to distinguish it from the Gamay teinturier grapes with red juice and different from the Napa Gamay and the Gamay Beaujolais grapes of California, is the most widely planted grape in Beaujolais, accounting for nearly 98% of all plantings. The remaining plantings are mostly Chardonnay. Aligote vines that were planted prior to 2004 are permitted in wine production, but the entire grape variety is being phased out of the region by 2024. According to AOC regulation, up to 15% of white wine grape varieties can be included in all Beaujolais red wines from the basic Beaujolais AOC to the Cru Beaujolais wines, but in practice the wines are almost always 100% Gamay. Pinot noir, which has very small plantings, is also permitted, but that grape is being phased out by 2015 as Beaujolais winemakers continue to focus their winemaking identity on the Gamay grape. The characteristics that the Gamay grapes adds to Beaujolais are a deep bluish-red color, high acidity, moderate tannins, and light to medium body. The aroma associated with the grape itself is typically red berries.

Since the 1960s, more focus has been placed on the choice of rootstocks and clonal selection, with six approved clones of Gamay for the wine region. In recent years the rootstock Vialla has gained popularity due to its propensity to produce well in granite soils. The SO4 and 3309 rootstocks also account for significant plantings. Clonal selection of the Gamay grape has shifted towards an emphasis on smaller, thicker-skinned berries.

==Winemaking and style==
Beaujolais wines are produced by the winemaking technique of semi-carbonic maceration. Whole grape clusters are put in cement or stainless steel tanks with capacities between . The bottom third of the grapes gets crushed under the weight of gravity and resulting must begins normal yeast fermentation with ambient yeasts found naturally on the skins of the grapes. Carbon dioxide is released as a byproduct of this fermentation and begins to saturate the individual intact grape berries that remain in the barrel. The carbon dioxide seeps into the skin of the grape and begin to stimulate fermentation at an intracellular level. This is caused, in part, by the absence of oxygen in the winemaking environment. This results in a fruity wine without much tannin. In the case of Beaujolais nouveau, this process is completed in as little as four days, with the other AOCs being allowed longer time to ferment. As the grapes ferment longer, they develop more tannins and a fuller body. Maximum length of the &quot;cuvaison&quot; for Nouveau wines is limited to 10 days.

After fermentation, the must is normally high in malic acid and producers will put the wine through malolactic fermentation to soften the wine. The process of chaptalization, adding sugar to the grape must to boost alcohol levels, has been a controversial issue for Beaujolais winemakers. Historically, Beaujolais producers would pick grapes at ripeness that were at minimum potential alcohol levels of 10–10.5% and then add sugar in order to artificially boost the alcohol levels to the near the maximum of 13–13.5%. This created wines lacking structure and balance to go with the high alcohol body and mouthfeel. The recent trend towards higher quality wine production has limited the use of chaptalization in the premium levels of Beaujolais wine. Filtering the wine in order to stabilize it is practiced to varying degrees by Beaujolais winemakers. Some producers who make Beaujolais on a large commercial scale will filter the wine aggressively to avoid any impurity or future chemical reactions. This can have the negative side effect of diminishing some of the wine&#x27;s unique fruit character and leave a flavor that critics have described as Jell-O-like.

Basic Beaujolais is the classic bistro wine of Paris; a fruity, easy-drinking red traditionally served in 1 pint glass bottles known as &quot;pots&quot;. This is epitomized in Beaujolais nouveau, which is fermented for just a few days and can be dominated by estery flavors such as bananas and pear drops. Basic Beaujolais and Beaujolais nouveau are meant to be drunk within a year of their harvest. Beaujolais-Villages are generally consumed within two to three years and Cru Beaujolais has the potential to age longer, some not even fully developing till at least three years after harvest. Premium examples from Chénas, Juliénas, Morgon and Moulin-à-Vent can spend up to 10 years continuing to develop in the bottle and in very good vintages can take on Burgundian qualities of structure and complexity.

==Wine industry==
The Beaujolais wine industry is dominated by the more than 30 &quot;négociants&quot; who produce nearly 90% of the wine sold outside the Beaujolais region. Many of these &quot;négociants&quot;, such as Maison Louis Jadot (which owns Moulin-à-Vent-based Château des Jacques) and Bouchard Père et Fils, are based in Burgundy. One of the most well known Beaujolais producers is the &quot;négociant&quot; Georges Duboeuf. There are more than 4000 vineyard owners in Beaujolais and the fractional amount that is not sold to &quot;négociants&quot; are bottled by the nearly 20 village co-operatives with a growing amount being estate bottled. Very little of the estate bottled Beaujolais wines are exported into the United States or United Kingdom though a few exporters specialize in this small niche—the most notable being Kermit Lynch and Alain Jugenet.

==Serving and food pairing==

Wine expert Karen MacNeil has described Beaujolais as &quot;the only white wine that happens to be red&quot;. Similarly, Beaujolais is often treated like a white wine and served slightly chilled to a lower temperature, the lighter the style. Beaujolais nouveau, being the lightest style, is served at about . Beaujolais AOC and Beaujolais-Villages are generally served between . Cru Beaujolais, especially the fuller bodied examples, can be treated like red Burgundy wine and served at . The wines rarely need to be decanted. In Beaujolais, it is traditional to soak the bottles in buckets of ice water and bring them out to the village&#x27;s center for picnics and games of boules.

Beaujolais wine can be paired with a variety of food according to the lightness and body of the wine. Beaujolais Nouveau is typically used as an apéritif with basic Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages doing well with light fare, like picnics and salads. The lighter Cru Beaujolais pair well with poultry and the heavier Crus pairing better with red meats and hearty dishes like stews. In Norway, Beaujolais is a favorite with cod and bacalhau dishes. According to Lyon chef Paul Bocuse, Beaujolais wine is used to make a traditional regional dessert involving a glass of sliced peaches, topped with blackcurrants and drenched in chilled Beaujolais wine.

<text>Pig is a simple, collecting card game of early 20th century American origin suitable for three to thirteen players that is played with a 52-card French-suited pack. It has two very similar and well known variants – donkey and spoons. It is often classed as a children&#x27;s game. It may be descended from an old game called vive l&#x27;amour.

== History ==
According to Richard L. Frey, the ancestor of pig was an old, four-player game called Vive l&#x27;Amour in which the aim was to be first to collect all 13 cards of one suit. The rules of vive l&#x27;amour first appear in 1821 and it continued to feature until the early 20th century. Despite the name it only ever appears in German literature. Later sources say that, on going out, the winner shouts &quot;Vive l&#x27;amour!&quot; which explains the story that when the Patriarch of Venice, Jacques Monico was playing cards, he called &quot;Vive Marie!&quot; whenever the rules required him to shout &quot;Vive l&#x27;amour!&quot;

Frey thus sees pig as a &quot;modern simplification&quot; of vive l&#x27;amour, its name being simply a &quot;bowdlerism&quot; of the earlier game. Pig is first recorded in 1911 where it is called &quot;a rather noisy game&quot; in which the first player to collect a quartet (four of a kind) laid their cards down &quot;either quietly or violently, as he may choose&quot; and the last one to put cards down became &quot;pig&quot;. The number of rounds was agreed in advance and the player who came last the fewest number of times was the winner or &quot;big pig.&quot;

Although intended for children, the game was also apparently played by adults with special cards in those parts of the US where standard playing cards were taboo. 

In 1957, a variant, donkey, is mentioned by Culbertson. The rules are identical; the main exception being that, whereas in pig players touch their noses when they acquire a quartet, in donkey, a number of objects – one fewer than the number of players – is placed in the middle and the first player with a quartet calls &quot;Donkey!&quot; and takes one. The subtle distinction between the two games is missed by some later authors. Gibson (1974) states that the games are &quot;practically identical&quot;, while Maguire describes pig but calls it donkey. Maguire introduces the rule that &#x27;donkeys&#x27; receive the letters of the word and the first to spell the whole word is the overall loser. He also records the game of Spoons for the first time, describing it as a variant in which, however, the player who stays to the end without spelling is the overall winner. Arnold equates pig and donkey, while Spadaccini and Bicycle Cards faithfully describe the original pig. Katz conflates pig with spoons and uses the whole pack instead of the selecting and shuffling 4 quartets per player, but adds some interesting variations. A good summary of the rules and variations for pig and spoons is at pagat.com.

== Rules ==

=== Vive l&#x27;amour ===
Vive l&#x27;amour is the earliest known game of this type. The following is a summary of its earliest rules (1821), which were reprinted until at least 1889.

The game is for four players and uses a full pack of 52 French-suited cards. After being well shuffled the cards are dealt around so that each player receives 13 cards. Forehand begins by exchanging a card, face down, with the player to his or her right. That player does the same and this continues around the circle. As soon as a player has 13 cards in the same suit, they show their hand and win the stake for that hand.

In the late 19th century, however, a modified version appeared in which cards were exchanged &quot;to the left and right&quot; and the winner shouted &quot;Vive l&#x27;amour!&quot; on going out. Ulmann adds that each player anted an agreed stake to a pot beforehand and that the dealer dealt the cards one by one.

=== Pig ===
The rules of pig have changed little over time. Frey&#x27;s are as follows:

Pig is suitable for six to ten-year olds. Three to thirteen may play, but four to seven is best. The aim is to be first to collect a quartet, i.e. four cards of the same rank, known as a &quot;book&quot;. The game requires as many quartets as there are players e.g. if five play, five quartets are used from a 52-card pack and the rest laid aside. Players are dealt four cards each which they pick up and view. Then all the players simultaneously discard one card face down to their left and, after doing so, they all pick up the card from the player to their right. A player who collects a &quot;book&quot; immediately touches the nose with a finger. As soon as they spot this, the other players do likewise. The last player to touch the nose is the pig and loses the deal.

According to Culbertson, the game is best for more than three players – &quot;the more the merrier&quot; – and is often played by adults at parties as an ice-breaker.

Variations:
* &quot;Go!&quot; or &quot;Start!&quot;: The dealer calls &quot;Go&quot; or &quot;Start&quot; to initiate the passing each time. Once all players have passed their cards to the left, if no-one has a quartet, play continues until any player has a quartet.
* &quot;P-I-G&quot;: Each player has three lives scored as . The first player to be assigned is the overall loser and, optionally, has to oink like a pig. Alternatively, whoever is assigned is eliminated from the game so that the last player standing is the overall winner.
* &quot;Pointing&quot;: Players point to their noses instead of touching them.
* &quot;Twin Pack&quot;: For more than 13 players, two packs may be used.
* &quot;Two Winners&quot;: The loser drops out after each deal, and the last two left in are joint winners.

=== Donkey ===
Having probably emerged by 1945, the rules of a variant called donkey are described in the 1957 &quot;Culbertson&#x27;s Hoyle&quot;. They are the same as in the early version of pig above, except that &quot;a number of chips, matches, or other tokens&quot; are used; always one fewer than the number of active players. These objects are placed in the middle. A player who collects four of a kind, calls &quot;donkey&quot; and takes a chip, etc. The others now also pick up a chip if they can and the player left without a chip is the donkey and loses the game.

In Mulac (1946), donkey only differs in that, instead of placing a finger on their noses, players put their hands either side of their head imitating donkey ears. She also gives a version using objects such as spoons or spools, which she calls &quot;spoof&quot;.

Maguire (1990) adds the requirement for a scorekeeper and introduces the rule that, each time a player becomes the donkey, that player is assigned a letter from that word. The first player to be assigned all the letters, i.e. , is the loser.

Variations: 
* &quot;Swap!&quot;: The dealer calls &quot;Swap&quot; each time to initiate the exchanging of cards.
* &quot;Prizes&quot;: For a party game, prizes are used as the objects.

=== Spoons ===

The name spoons first appears in 1990. It is essentially donkey using spoons as the objects to be picked up. However, a version of pig called &quot;spoof&quot; using &quot;empty thread spools or spoons or some other small article...&quot; is described by Mulac as early as 1946.

In spoons, the player left without a spoon in each deal is assigned a letter from the word &#x27;spoons&#x27;. The player who gets is eliminated from the game, and the game continues. The last player standing is the winner.

Variations:
* &quot;Stockpile&quot;: A whole 52-card pack is used, and so there is a stockpile from which the dealer draws each time and a discard pile to which the player on his or her right passes a card each time.
* &quot;Five Cards&quot;: Players are dealt five cards each, but still only need a four-of-a-kind to pick up a spoon.
* &quot;Extreme Spoons/Hidden Spoons&quot;: Instead of the middle of the play area as usual, the spoons are placed in some inconvenient location nearby.
* &quot;Series&quot;: As its name implies, it is a series of games with one player eliminated each time, and the last player standing is the overall winner.
* &quot;Two Winners&quot;: Similar to Series, but the last two players left in are joint winners.

=== Tongue ===
In the game of tongue, players quietly stick out their tongue when they have a quartet.

== Tactics ==
Tactics may include:

*&quot;Bluffing&quot;: Bluffing is allowed. Spoons may be reached at any time as long as they are not touched. This may distract the others or even cause players to grab a spoon prematurely which may result in their elimination.
*&quot;Eyes on the spoons&quot;: Players keep an eye on the number of spoons in case one has been taken without anyone noticing.
* &quot;Continuing to play&quot;. After sticking out a tongue or collecting a spoon, a player may continue to pass and pick up to confuse other players, but must keep the quartet intact. This is not possible with pig as one hand is needed to touch the nose.

<doc id="226505" wikidata="Q858223" url="?curid=226505" title="Accumulation point">
<text>In mathematics, a limit point, accumulation point, or cluster point of a set formula_1 in a topological space formula_2 is a point formula_3 that can be &quot;approximated&quot; by points of formula_1 in the sense that every neighbourhood of formula_3 contains a point of formula_1 other than formula_3 itself. A limit point of a set formula_1 does not itself have to be an element of formula_9 
There is also a closely related concept for sequences. A cluster point or accumulation point of a sequence formula_10 in a topological space formula_2 is a point formula_3 such that, for every neighbourhood formula_13 of formula_14 there are infinitely many natural numbers formula_15 such that formula_16 This definition of a cluster or accumulation point of a sequence generalizes to nets and filters. 

The similarly named notion of a (respectively, a limit point of a filter, a limit point of a net) by definition refers to a point that the sequence converges to (respectively, the filter converges to, the net converges to). Importantly, although &quot;limit point of a set&quot; is synonymous with &quot;cluster/accumulation point of a set&quot;, this is not true for sequences (nor nets or filters). That is, the term &quot;limit point of a sequence&quot; is synonymous with &quot;cluster/accumulation point of a sequence&quot;. 

The limit points of a set should not be confused with adherent points (also called ) for which every neighbourhood of formula_3 contains &quot;some&quot; point of formula_1. Unlike for limit points, an adherent point formula_3 of formula_1 may have a neighbourhood not containing points other than formula_3 itself. A limit point can be characterized as an adherent point that is not an isolated point.

Limit points of a set should also not be confused with boundary points. For example, formula_22 is a boundary point (but not a limit point) of the set formula_23 in formula_24 with standard topology. However, formula_25 is a limit point (though not a boundary point) of interval formula_26 in formula_24 with standard topology (for a less trivial example of a limit point, see the first caption).

This concept profitably generalizes the notion of a limit and is the underpinning of concepts such as closed set and topological closure. Indeed, a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points, and the topological closure operation can be thought of as an operation that enriches a set by uniting it with its limit points.

==Definition==

===Accumulation points of a set===
Let formula_1 be a subset of a topological space formula_29 
A point formula_3 in formula_2 is a limit point or cluster point or formula_1 if every neighbourhood of formula_3 contains at least one point of formula_1 different from formula_3 itself. 

It does not make a difference if we restrict the condition to open neighbourhoods only. It is often convenient to use the &quot;open neighbourhood&quot; form of the definition to show that a point is a limit point and to use the &quot;general neighbourhood&quot; form of the definition to derive facts from a known limit point. 

If formula_2 is a formula_37 space (such as a metric space), then formula_38 is a limit point of formula_1 if and only if every neighbourhood of formula_3 contains infinitely many points of formula_9 In fact, formula_37 spaces are characterized by this property. 

If formula_2 is a Fréchet–Urysohn space (which all metric spaces and first-countable spaces are), then formula_38 is a limit point of formula_1 if and only if there is a sequence of points in formula_46 whose limit is formula_47 In fact, Fréchet–Urysohn spaces are characterized by this property.

The set of limit points of formula_1 is called the derived set of formula_9

====Special types of accumulation point of a set====

If every neighbourhood of formula_3 contains infinitely many points of formula_51 then formula_3 is a specific type of limit point called an of formula_9 

If every neighbourhood of formula_3 contains uncountably many points of formula_51 then formula_3 is a specific type of limit point called a condensation point of formula_9 

If every neighbourhood formula_58 of formula_3 is such that the cardinality of
formula_60 equals the cardinality of formula_51 then formula_3 is a specific type of limit point called a of formula_9

===Accumulation points of sequences and nets===

In a topological space formula_64 a point formula_38 is said to be a &#x27; or &#x27; formula_66 if, for every neighbourhood formula_13 of formula_14 there are infinitely many formula_69 such that formula_16 
It is equivalent to say that for every neighbourhood formula_13 of formula_3 and every formula_73 there is some formula_74 such that formula_16 
If formula_2 is a metric space or a first-countable space (or, more generally, a Fréchet–Urysohn space), then formula_3 is a cluster point of formula_78 if and only if formula_3 is a limit of some subsequence of formula_80 
The set of all cluster points of a sequence is sometimes called the limit set. 

Note that there is already the notion of limit of a sequence to mean a point formula_3 to which the sequence converges (that is, every neighborhood of formula_3 contains all but finitely many elements of the sequence). That is why we do not use the term of a sequence as a synonym for accumulation point of the sequence.

The concept of a net generalizes the idea of a sequence. A net is a function formula_83 where formula_84 is a directed set and formula_2 is a topological space. A point formula_38 is said to be a &#x27; or &#x27; formula_87 if, for every neighbourhood formula_13 of formula_3 and every formula_90 there is some formula_91 such that formula_92 equivalently, if formula_87 has a subnet which converges to formula_47 Cluster points in nets encompass the idea of both condensation points and ω-accumulation points. Clustering and limit points are also defined for filters.

==Relation between accumulation point of a sequence and accumulation point of a set==

Every sequence formula_66 in formula_2 is by definition just a map formula_97 so that its image formula_98 can be defined in the usual way. 

* If there exists an element formula_38 that occurs infinitely many times in the sequence, formula_3 is an accumulation point of the sequence. But formula_3 need not be an accumulation point of the corresponding set formula_102 For example, if the sequence is the constant sequence with value formula_14 we have formula_104 and formula_3 is an isolated point of formula_106 and not an accumulation point of formula_102

* If no element occurs infinitely many times in the sequence, for example if all the elements are distinct, any accumulation point of the sequence is an formula_108-accumulation point of the associated set formula_102

Conversely, given a countable infinite set formula_110 in formula_64 we can enumerate all the elements of formula_112 in many ways, even with repeats, and thus associate with it many sequences formula_78 that will satisfy formula_114

* Any formula_108-accumulation point of formula_112 is an accumulation point of any of the corresponding sequences (because any neighborhood of the point will contain infinitely many elements of formula_112 and hence also infinitely many terms in any associated sequence).

* A point formula_38 that is an formula_108-accumulation point of formula_112 cannot be an accumulation point of any of the associated sequences without infinite repeats (because formula_3 has a neighborhood that contains only finitely many (possibly even none) points of formula_112 and that neighborhood can only contain finitely many terms of such sequences).

==Properties==

Every limit of a non-constant sequence is an accumulation point of the sequence.
And by definition, every limit point is an adherent point.

The closure formula_123 of a set formula_1 is a disjoint union of its limit points formula_125 and isolated points formula_126; that is,
formula_127

A point formula_38 is a limit point of formula_129 if and only if it is in the closure of formula_130
If we use formula_125 to denote the set of limit points of formula_51 then we have the following characterization of the closure of formula_1: The closure of formula_1 is equal to the union of formula_1 and formula_136 This fact is sometimes taken as the of closure.

A corollary of this result gives us a characterisation of closed sets: A set formula_1 is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points.

No isolated point is a limit point of any set.

A space formula_2 is discrete if and only if no subset of formula_2 has a limit point.

If a space formula_2 has the trivial topology and formula_1 is a subset of formula_2 with more than one element, then all elements of formula_2 are limit points of formula_9 If formula_1 is a singleton, then every point of formula_146 is a limit point of formula_9

<text>A cuirass ( ; ; ) is a piece of armour that covers the torso, formed of one or more pieces of metal or other rigid material. The word probably originates from the original material, leather, from the French &quot;&quot; and Latin word &quot;&quot;. The use of the term &quot;cuirass&quot; generally refers to both the breastplate and the backplate pieces; whereas a breastplate only protects the front, a cuirass protects both the front and the back of the wearer.

==Description==

In Hellenistic and Roman times, the musculature of the male torso was idealized in the form of the muscle cuirass or &quot;heroic cuirass&quot; (in French the &quot;cuirasse esthétique&quot;) sometimes further embellished with symbolic representation in relief, familiar in the Augustus of Prima Porta and other heroic representations in official Roman sculpture. As parts of the actual military equipment of classical antiquity, cuirasses and corsets of bronze, iron, or some other rigid substance were used. Secondary protection for the breast was worn in earlier times by men-at-arms in addition to mail hauberks and reinforced coats. It was not until the 14th century that the plate armour became an established part of medieval armour.

==History==

The Roman emperor Galba donned a cuirass just before he went to his death. Suetonius records in &quot;12 Caesars&quot; that, &quot;As [Galba] was offering sacrifice on the morning before he was killed, a soothsayer warned him again and again to look out for danger, since assassins were not far off. Not long after this he learned that Otho held possession of the camp, and when several advised him to proceed thither as soon as possible – for they said that he could win the day by his presence and prestige – he decided to do no more than hold his present position and strengthen it by getting together a guard of the legionaries, who were encamped in many different quarters of the city. He did however put on a linen cuirass, though he openly declared that it would afford little protection against so many swords.&quot;

The latter portion of the 14th century saw the cuirass gradually come into general use in connection with plate armour for the limbs until, at the close of the century, mail was phased out among the nobles (e.g., knights) except in the camail of the bascinet and at the edge of the hauberk. The cuirass was almost universally worn throughout its lifespan as a form of armour. The globule form of the breast-armour of the Black Prince, in his effigy in Canterbury Cathedral, 1376, intimates that a cuirass (as well as a hauberk) is to be considered to have been covered by the royalty-emblazoned jupon (surcoat) of the Prince.

Historical cuirass, contrary to many modern reproductions, did not rest on the hips. Historical cuirass usually stopped somewhere around the midriff or navel in order to allow a sufficient range of movement to the wearer. A cuirass ending at the waist would severely limit the ability of the wearer to lean forward, backward, or sideways. Thus, to protect the rest of the torso, mail, or fauld were used, depending on the time period.
Early in the 15th century, plate armour, including the cuirass, began to be worn without any surcoat; but in the concluding quarter of the century the short surcoat, with full short sleeves, known as a &quot;tabard&quot;, was in general use over the armour. While the surcoat was being phased out, small plates of various forms and sizes (and not always made in pairs, i.e., the plate for the sword-arm often being smaller and lighter than the one for the off-hand) were attached to the armour in front of the shoulders, to defend the otherwise vulnerable points where the plate defenses left a gap.

About the middle of the 15th century, the breastplate of the cuirass was made in two parts; the lower adjusted to overlap the upper, held together with a strap or sliding rivet in order to add flexibility to the advantages plate armour had over mail. In the second half of the 15th century, the cuirass was occasionally superseded by the brigandine jacket, the medieval forerunner of the flak jacket. In essence, the brigandine jacket was constructed of metal plates sewn into a fabric jacket. The fabric was generally a rich material, and was lined throughout with overlapping scales of metal which were attached to the jacket by rivets, having their heads, like studs, visible on the outside.
Around 1550, the breastplate piece of the cuirass was characterized by a vertical central ridge, called the &quot;tapul&quot;, having near its center a projecting point. Somewhat later, the &quot;tapul&quot; was moved lower on the breastplate. Eventually, the profile of the plate began to resemble a pea pod and, as such, was referred to as the peascod cuirass. During the English Civil War (1642–1651), only the wealthiest and physically strongest men could afford this type of armour.

Corslets, provided with both the breast and back pieces, were worn by foot-soldiers in the 17th century, while their mounted comrades were equipped with heavier and stronger cuirasses. These defenses continued in use longer than any other single piece of armour. Their use never altogether ceased and in modern armies mounted cuirassiers, armed with breast and back plates as in the earlier days, have, to some degree, emulated the martial splendour of the body armour of the era of medieval chivalry.

British, French, German, and Russian heavy cavalry wore cuirasses as part of their parade uniforms leading up to World War I. Although in the early part of the conflict, the French still wore their cuirasses into battle, for the most part they were covered with a cloth canvas for protection against the weather and to reduce enemy visibility, as well as their ornate neo-Roman style helmets. All other militaries had taken them out of combat use by World War II.

Some years after the Battle of Waterloo (1815), certain historical cuirasses were taken from their repose in the Tower of London and adapted for ceremonial service by the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals of the British Army&#x27;s Household Cavalry.

For parade purposes, the Prussian Gardes du Corps and other corps wore cuirasses of richly decorated leather. The Pontifical Swiss Guard still wear cuirasses for swearing-in ceremonies, Christmas and Easter.

===Japanese cuirass===
Cuirasses were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century. &quot;Tankō&quot;, worn by foot soldiers, and &quot;keikō&quot;, worn by horsemen, were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese cuirass constructed from iron plates connected by leather thongs. During the Heian period (794–1185), Japanese armourers started to use leather as a material and lacquer for weatherproofing.

By the end of the Heian period, the Japanese cuirass had arrived at the shape recognized as part of iconic samurai armour. Scales of iron and leather, bound together by silk lace, were used to construct samurai armour. The introduction of firearms to Japan in 1543 resulted in the development of a cuirass constructed of solid iron plates. The use of the samurai cuirass lasted until the 1860s, when the national army using conventional uniforms and weapons was established. Samurai armour was last worn into battle during the Satsuma Rebellion (1877).

<text>The Hambletonian Stakes is a major American harness race for three-year-old trotting horses, named in honor of Hambletonian 10, a foundation sire of the Standardbred horse breed, also known as the &quot;Father of the American Trotter.&quot; The first in the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters, the Hambletonian is currently held at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on the first Saturday in August.

==Sites==
The Hambletonian first took place at the New York State Fair in Syracuse in 1926. The race switched from Syracuse to Lexington, Kentucky for the 1927 and 1929 races, however, because of rainouts. Starting in 1930, Good Time Park in Goshen, New York hosted the race until 1956 with the exception of 1943. That year, The Hambletonian was raced at Empire City Race Track, which became Yonkers Raceway in 1950, because of wartime gas rationing. The Du Quoin State Fair in Du Quoin, Illinois gained the rights to host the race in 1957 and held on to it until 1980. Since 1981, the race has been at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

<text>Stephen Jay Greenblatt (born November 7, 1943) is an American literary historian and author. He has served as the John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University since 2000. Greenblatt is the general editor of &quot;The Norton Shakespeare&quot; (2015) and the general editor and a contributor to &quot;The Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot;.

Greenblatt is one of the founders of new historicism, a set of critical practices that he often refers to as &quot;cultural poetics&quot;; his works have been influential since the early 1980s when he introduced the term. Greenblatt has written and edited numerous books and articles relevant to new historicism, the study of culture, Renaissance studies and Shakespeare studies and is considered to be an expert in these fields. He is also co-founder of the literary-cultural journal &quot;Representations&quot;, which often publishes articles by new historicists. His most popular work is &quot;Will in the World&quot;, a biography of Shakespeare that was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for nine weeks. He won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 2012 and the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 2011 for &quot;The Swerve: How the World Became Modern&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Education and career===
Greenblatt was born in Boston and raised in Newton, Massachusetts. After graduating from Newton High School, he was educated at Yale University (BA 1964, PhD 1969) and Pembroke College, Cambridge (MPhil 1966). Greenblatt has since taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard University. He was Class of 1972 Professor at Berkeley (becoming a full professor in 1980) and taught there for 28 years before taking a position at Harvard University. He was named John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities in 2000. Greenblatt is considered &quot;a key figure in the shift from literary to cultural poetics and from textual to contextual interpretation in U.S. English departments in the 1980s and 1990s.&quot;

Greenblatt is the founder and faculty co-chair of Harvard&#x27;s branch of the Scholars at Risk (SAR) program. SAR is a U.S.-based international network of academic institutions organized to support and defend the principles of academic freedom and to defend the human rights of scholars around the world. Greenblatt was a long-term fellow of the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin. As a visiting professor and lecturer, Greenblatt has taught at institutions including the École des Hautes Études, the University of Florence, Kyoto University, the University of Oxford and Peking University. He was a resident fellow at the American Academy in Rome, and is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1987), the American Philosophical Society (2007), and the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2008); he has been president of the Modern Language Association.
In February 2022, Greenblatt was one of 38 Harvard faculty to sign a letter to &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; defending Professor John Comaroff, who had been found to have violated the university&#x27;s sexual and professional conduct policies. After students filed a lawsuit with detailed allegations of Comaroff&#x27;s actions and the university&#x27;s failure to respond, Greenblatt was one of several signatories to say that he wished to retract his name from the letter.

===Family===
Greenblatt is an Eastern European Jew, an Ashkenazi, and a Litvak. His observant Jewish grandparents were born in Lithuania; his paternal grandparents were from Kaunas and his maternal grandparents were from Vilnius. Greenblatt&#x27;s grandparents immigrated to the United States during the early 1890s in order to escape a Czarist Russification plan to conscript young Jewish men into the Russian army.

In 1998, he married literary critic Ramie Targoff, whom he has described as his soulmate.

==Work==
Greenblatt has written extensively on Shakespeare, the Renaissance, culture and New Historicism (which he often refers to as &quot;cultural poetics&quot;). Much of his work has been &quot;part of a collective project&quot;, such as his work as co-editor of the Berkeley-based literary-cultural journal &quot;Representations&quot; (which he co-founded in 1983), as editor of publications such as the &quot;Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot;, and as co-author of books such as &quot;Practicing New Historicism&quot; (2000), which he wrote with Catherine Gallagher. Greenblatt has also written on such subjects as travelling in Laos and China, story-telling, and miracles.

Greenblatt&#x27;s collaboration with Charles L. Mee, &quot;Cardenio&quot;, premiered on May 8, 2008, at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While the critical response to &quot;Cardenio&quot; was mixed, audiences responded quite positively. The American Repertory Theater has posted audience responses on the organization&#x27;s blog. &quot;Cardenio&quot; has been adapted for performance in ten countries, with additional international productions planned.

He wrote his 2018 book &quot;Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics&quot; out of anxiety over the 2016 US presidential election.

===New Historicism===

Greenblatt first used the term &quot;New Historicism&quot; in his 1982 introduction to &quot;The Power of Forms in the English Renaissance&quot; wherein he uses Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s &quot;bitter reaction to the revival of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; on the eve of the Essex rebellion&quot; to illustrate the &quot;mutual permeability of the literary and the historical&quot;. New Historicism is regarded by many to have influenced &quot;every traditional period of English literary history&quot;. Some critics have charged that it is &quot;antithetical to literary and aesthetic value, that it reduces the historical to the literary or the literary to the historical, that it denies human agency and creativity, that it is somehow out to subvert the politics of cultural and critical theory [and] that it is anti-theoretical&quot;. Scholars have observed that New Historicism is, in fact, &quot;neither new nor historical.&quot; Others praise New Historicism as &quot;a collection of practices&quot; employed by critics to gain a more comprehensive understanding of literature by considering it in historical context while treating history itself as &quot;historically contingent on the present in which [it is] constructed&quot;.

As stated by Shakespeare scholar Jonathan Bate, the approach of New Historicism has been &quot;the most influential strand of criticism over the last 25 years, with its view that literary creations are cultural formations shaped by &#x27;the circulation of social energy&#x27;.&quot; When told that several American job advertisements were requesting responses from experts in New Historicism, Greenblatt remembered thinking: &quot;&#x27;You&#x27;ve got to be kidding. You know it was just something we made up!&#x27; I began to see there were institutional consequences to what seemed like a not particularly deeply thought-out term.&quot;

He has also said that &quot;My deep, ongoing interest is in the relation between literature and history, the process through which certain remarkable works of art are at once embedded in a highly specific life-world and seem to pull free of that life-world. I am constantly struck by the strangeness of reading works that seem addressed, personally and intimately, to me, and yet were written by people who crumbled to dust long ago&quot;.

Greenblatt&#x27;s works on New Historicism and &quot;cultural poetics&quot; include &quot;Practicing New Historicism&quot; (2000) (with Catherine Gallagher), in which Greenblatt discusses how &quot;they anecdote ... appears as the &#x27;touch of the real&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Towards a Poetics of Culture&quot; (1987), in which Greenblatt asserts that the question of &quot;how art and society are interrelated,&quot; as posed by Jean-François Lyotard and Fredric Jameson, &quot;cannot be answered by appealing to a single theoretical stance&quot;. &quot;Renaissance Self-Fashioning&quot; and the introduction to the &quot;Norton Shakespeare&quot; are regarded as good examples of Greenblatt&#x27;s application of new historicist practices.

New Historicism acknowledges that any criticism of a work is colored by the critic&#x27;s beliefs, social status, and other factors. Many New Historicists begin a critical reading of a novel by explaining themselves, their backgrounds, and their prejudices. Both the work and the reader are affected by everything that has influenced them. New Historicism thus represents a significant change from previous critical theories like New Criticism, because its main focus is to look at many elements outside of the work, instead of reading the text in isolation.

===Shakespeare and Renaissance studies===
Greenblatt&#x27;s work contextualizes Shakespeare against the English Renaissance as a whole, believing &quot;that nothing comes of nothing, even in Shakespeare.&quot; In particular, as he states in &quot;&quot;King Lear&quot; and Harsnett&#x27;s &#x27;Devil-Fiction&#x27;,&quot; Greenblatt believes that &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s self-consciousness is in significant ways bound up with the institutions and the symbology of power it anatomizes&quot;. His work on Shakespeare has addressed such topics as ghosts, purgatory, anxiety, exorcists and revenge. He is also a general editor of the &quot;Norton Shakespeare&quot;. This New Historicism opposes the ways in which New Criticism consigns texts &quot;to an autonomous aesthetic realm that [dissociates] Renaissance writing from other forms of cultural production&quot; and the historicist notion that Renaissance texts mirror &quot;a coherent world-view that was held by a whole population,&quot; asserting instead &quot;that critics who [wish] to understand sixteenth- and seventeenth-century writing must delineate the ways the texts they [study] were linked to the network of institutions, practices, and beliefs that constituted Renaissance culture in its entirety&quot;. Greenblatt&#x27;s work in Renaissance studies includes &quot;Renaissance Self-Fashioning&quot; (1980), which &quot;had a transformative impact on Renaissance studies&quot;.

===&quot;Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot;===
Greenblatt joined M. H. Abrams as general editor of &quot;The Norton Anthology of English Literature&quot; published by W. W. Norton during the 1990s. He is also the co-editor of the anthology&#x27;s section on Renaissance literature and the general editor of the &quot;Norton Shakespeare&quot;, &quot;currently his most influential piece of public pedagogy.&quot;

===Political commentary===
Although it does not refer to Donald Trump directly, Greenblatt&#x27;s 2018 book, &quot;Tyrant: Shakespeare on Power&quot;, was considered by literary critics in leading newspapers as criticism of the Trump administration.

Shot in Eastman Color, the film was made in collaboration with stop-motion animation visual effects artist Ray Harryhausen and is known for its various legendary creatures, notably the iconic fight scene featuring seven skeleton warriors. Although it was a box-office disappointment during its initial release, the film was critically acclaimed and later considered a classic.

The film score was composed by Bernard Herrmann, who had partnered with Harryhausen on &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1958), &quot;The 3 Worlds of Gulliver&quot; (1960) and &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (1961).

==Plot==
Pelias usurps the throne of Thessaly, killing King Aristo. A prophecy states that one of Aristo&#x27;s children will avenge him. Aristo&#x27;s infant son Jason is spirited away by one of Aristo&#x27;s soldiers. Pelias slays one of Aristo&#x27;s daughters after she seeks sanctuary in the temple of the goddess Hera. Because the murder has profaned her temple, Hera becomes Jason&#x27;s protector. She warns Pelias to beware of &quot;a one-sandaled man&quot;.

Twenty years later, Jason saves Pelias from drowning in a river, an &quot;accident&quot; orchestrated by Hera, losing his sandal in the process. Pelias recognizes his enemy. Jason intends to seek the legendary Golden Fleece to rally support against Pelias. The king, who hopes Jason will die in the quest, encourages him to set forth.

Hermes takes Jason to Mount Olympus to speak with Zeus and Hera. Zeus decrees that Hera can help him only five times, the same number of times that Jason&#x27;s murdered sister called on her for protection. She directs him to search for the Fleece in the land of Colchis. Zeus offers aid, but Jason declines.

He sets out to build a ship and recruit a crew. Men from all over Greece compete for the honor of joining his quest. Because their ship is named the &quot;Argo&quot; after its builder, Argus, the crew are dubbed the Argonauts. Among them are Hercules, Hylas, and Acastus, who was secretly sent by his father Pelias to sabotage the voyage.

When Jason runs low on supplies, Hera guides him to the Isle of Bronze, warning him to take nothing but provisions. However, Hercules steals a brooch pin the size of a javelin from a building filled with treasure and surmounted by a gigantic bronze statue of Talos. The statue comes to life and attacks the Argonauts. Jason again turns to Hera, who tells him to open a large plug at the back of Talos&#x27;s heel to release the giant&#x27;s ichor. Talos falls to the ground, crushing Hylas and hiding his body. Hercules refuses to leave until he ascertains the fate of his friend. The other Argonauts are unwilling to abandon Hercules, so Jason calls upon Hera again. She informs them that Hylas is dead and that Zeus has other plans for Hercules.

She directs Jason to seek Phineus, who has been blinded and is tormented by harpies for misusing Zeus&#x27;s gift of prophesy. After the Argonauts capture and cage the harpies, Phineus tells them how to reach Colchis, by sailing between the Clashing Rocks. He also gives Jason an amulet of the sea god Triton. The Argonauts see another ship trying to pass through the other way, only to be crushed and sunk when the Clashing Rocks smash together. When the &quot;Argo&quot; tries to row through, the ship appears doomed as well. In despair, Jason throws Phineus&#x27;s amulet into the water, whereupon Triton rises and holds the rocks apart long enough for the &quot;Argo&quot; to pass. Upon clearing the rocks, the Argonauts rescue several survivors from the other ship, including Medea, high priestess of Colchis.

Finally nearing Colchis, Acastus challenges Jason&#x27;s authority and fights him. Disarmed, Acastus jumps into the sea and disappears. Jason and his men land and accept an invitation from King Aeëtes to a feast. Unknown to them, Acastus has warned Aeëtes of Jason&#x27;s quest for the Golden Fleece. Aeëtes has the unwary Argonauts imprisoned, but Medea, having fallen in love with Jason, helps him and his men escape.

Acastus tries to steal the Fleece first, but is killed by its guardian, the Hydra. Jason kills the beast and takes the Fleece. Medea is mortally wounded by an arrow, but Jason heals her with the Fleece. Aeëtes then sows the Hydra&#x27;s teeth and prays to the goddess, Hecate. Seven armed skeletons, the &quot;children of the Hydra&#x27;s teeth&quot;, emerge from the ground. Jason, Phalerus and Castor, hold them off, while Medea and Argus escape back to the &quot;Argo&quot; with the Fleece. After a prolonged battle, in which his companions are killed, Jason escapes by jumping into the sea. Jason, Medea, and the surviving Argonauts begin their voyage home to Thessaly. On Olympus, Zeus tells Hera that while he is impressed, he is not done with Jason. Hera looks on eagerly.

==Production==
===Film score===
The film is one of the mythically-themed fantasies scored by Bernard Herrmann. Apart from being the composer&#x27;s fourth collaboration with Ray Harryhausen (&quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, &quot;The 3 Worlds of Gulliver&quot;, and &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, made in 1958, 1960, and 1961 respectively), Herrmann also scored the science fiction films &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1959).

Contrasting with Herrmann&#x27;s all-string score for &quot;Psycho&quot;, the film&#x27;s soundtrack was made without a string section. This leaves the brass and percussion to perform the heroic fanfares, and the woodwinds along with additional instruments (such as the harp) to dominate in the more subtle and romantic parts.

In 1995, Intrada released a re-recording of the original score. The new version was conducted by American composer/conductor Bruce Broughton, and performed by the Sinfonia of London.

===Differences from classical mythology===

The film differs in some ways from the traditional telling in Greek mythology:
* Pelias does not kill his half-brother King Aristo (Aeson) but instead had him imprisoned. Eventually, it is Medea, and not Jason, who kills Pelias; she demonstrates to Pelias&#x27; daughters that she can rejuvenate an old ram into a young one by killing, chopping and boiling it in a pot. She promises to do the same for Pelias, so his daughters kill and chop him. However, Medea breaks her word and Pelias remains dead.
* Hera does not attempt to kill Pelias herself by drowning him in the river Anavros. Instead, in order to prove Jason&#x27;s virtuous heart to Zeus, she disguises herself as an old woman unable to cross on her own. Jason, feeling sympathy for the lady, ferries her across on his back but loses a sandal into its depths.
* In mythology, the Argonauts encountered Talos on their return journey after they had obtained the Golden Fleece. He was defeated not by Jason, but by Medea casting a spell on Talos, causing him to remove the bronze nail from his ankle which kept the ichor inside. The mythological Talos guarded Crete, not the &quot;Isle of Bronze&quot;, and was protecting not a treasure, but Queen Europa.
* In the film, Hylas was killed when the crumbling remains of Talos crushed him. However, in mythology, Hylas was actually kidnapped by a naiad who fell in love with him as he took a drink from a spring. When Hercules could not find him, he believed him to still be alive, and stayed behind on the island to look for him (as in the film).
* The harpies were not caught in a net or caged, but were chased away by the Boreads: Calaïs and Zetes (also Zethes)
* In the film, the god Triton saved the &quot;Argo&quot; from destruction passing through the Clashing Rocks: however; according to Apollonius of Rhodes, Phineus instructed Jason to release a dove and if the bird makes it through, row with all their might and the goddess Athena provided the extra push to the ship needed to clear them; &quot;the Argo darted from the rocks like a flying arrow&quot;. Another source is Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in which Circe tells Odysseus: &quot;One ship alone, one deep-sea craft sailed clear, the Argo, sung by the world, when heading home from Aeëtes shores. And she would have crashed against those giant rocks and sunk at once if Hera, for her love of Jason, had not sped her through.&quot;
* Jason was not betrayed by Acastus in the classical tale. Jason openly told King Aeëtes that he had come for the Fleece. The king promised Jason could have it if he performed three tasks, knowing full well they were impossible. However, Jason was able to complete the tasks with the help of Medea. It was not the Hydra that protected the Fleece but rather a dragon. Jason did not slay it, but instead, Medea cast a spell on it, causing it to fall asleep. Jason sowed the dragon&#x27;s teeth into the ground, not Aeëtes. Jason defeated the &quot;dragon&#x27;s offspring&quot; (the spartoi) by making them fight among themselves and destroy each other, rather than battling them with his colleagues.
* The Children of the Hydra&#x27;s Teeth were rotten corpses in the original legend, but because of the heavy censorship back then they were made as skeletons instead.
* One of the two Argonauts killed by the skeletons is Castor, who in Greek mythology would perish much later as the result of a feud with Idas and Lynceus. The other is Phalerus, who in mythology would also survive the adventures of the Argonauts.
* The film ultimately omits the story of Medea killing and butchering her own brother, Absyrtus, to help Jason and the Argonauts escape; and also the episodes with Cyzicus, the Gegeines and the Argonauts&#x27; stay on the isle of Lemnos.

==Reception==
The film had its world premiere on June 13, 1963, at the Texas Theatre in San Antonio, Texas. It saw a same-day release Wichita Falls, Texas, Honolulu, Hawaii, and Fort Worth, Texas.

It was also referenced in the 1989 song by They Might be Giants, &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul.&quot;

===Critical response===
The film received critical acclaim and is now considered a classic. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Don Chaffey&#x27;s &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; is an outlandish, transportive piece of nostalgia whose real star is the masterful stop-motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 69 based on 10 reviews.

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;The $3 million film has a workable scenario and has been directed resourcefully and spiritedly by Don Chaffey, under whose leadership a colorful cast performs with zeal.&quot;

Ray Harryhausen regarded the film as his best. Previous Harryhausen films had been generally shown as part of double features in &quot;B&quot; theatres. Columbia was able to book it as a single feature in many &quot;A&quot; theatres in the United States.

===Accolades===
At the special ceremony for the Academy Award for Technical Achievement held three weeks before the 1992 Academy Awards, Ray Harryhausen was honored with a lifetime-achievement award. The ceremony&#x27;s host, actor Tom Hanks, remarked: &quot;Some people say &quot;Casablanca&quot; or &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. I say &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; is the greatest film ever made&quot;.

In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated the film for its Top 10 Fantasy Films list.

In April 2004, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked Talos as the second-best film monster of all time, after &quot;King Kong&quot;.

==Home media==
Columbia released the film on Blu-ray (for regions A, B, and C) on 6 July 2010. The disc&#x27;s special features include two new audio commentaries, one by Peter Jackson and Randall William Cook, and the other by Harryhausen in conversation with his biographer Tony Dalton.

==Comic book adaptation==
The five-issue comic book miniseries &quot;Jason and the Argonauts: The Kingdom of Hades&quot; (2007) from TidalWave Productions&#x27; &quot;Ray Harryhausen Signature Series&quot;, continued the story. It was followed by &quot;Jason and the Argonauts: Final Chorus&quot; (2014).

<doc id="226519" wikidata="Q1545331" url="?curid=226519" title="The 7th Voyage of Sinbad">
<text>The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is a 1958 American Technicolor heroic fantasy adventure film directed by Nathan H. Juran and starring Kerwin Mathews, Kathryn Grant, Torin Thatcher, Richard Eyer, and Alec Mango. It was distributed by Columbia Pictures and produced by Charles H. Schneer.

It was the first of three Sinbad feature films from Columbia, the later two from the 1970s being &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1973) and &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot; (1977). All three Sinbad films were conceptualized by Ray Harryhausen using Dynamation, the full color widescreen stop-motion animation technique that he created.

While similarly named, the film does not follow the storyline of the tale &quot;The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor&quot; but instead has more in common with the Third and Fifth voyages of Sinbad.

&quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; was selected in 2008 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Sinbad the Sailor and his ship&#x27;s crew make landfall on the island of Colossa, where they encounter Sokurah the magician fleeing a giant cyclops. Though he escapes, Sokurah loses a magic lamp to the creature. Sinbad refuses his desperate pleas to return to Colossa because Parisa, Princess of Chandra, is aboard. Their coming marriage is meant to secure peace between her father&#x27;s realm and Sinbad&#x27;s homeland, Baghdad.

After reaching Baghdad, Sokurah performs magic at the pre-wedding festivities, temporarily turning Parisa&#x27;s handmaiden into a snake-like being. Despite his prowess and a dark prophecy about war between Baghdad and Chandra, the Caliph of Baghdad refuses to help the magician return to Colossa. Later that night, Sokurah secretly shrinks the princess, enraging her father, the Sultan of Chandra, who declares war on Baghdad. Sinbad and the Caliph give in to Sokurah, who explains that the eggshell of a Roc is needed for the potion that will restore Parisa, and it can be found only on Colossa. Sokurah provides Sinbad with the plans for a giant crossbow for protection against the island&#x27;s giant creatures.

Sinbad recruits additional crewmen from among the convicts in the Caliph&#x27;s prisons. Before they reach Colossa, the cutthroats are inspired to mutiny by the treacherous Karim and capture Sokurah, Sinbad, and his men. During a violent storm, the sounds of keening demons from a nearby island drives the crew nearly mad, endangering the ship. One of the men releases Sinbad so he can save them, after Karim falls to his death from the crow&#x27;s nest.

On Colossa, Sinbad, Sokurah, and six of his crew enter the valley of the cyclops, followed by Sinbad&#x27;s loyal aide Harufa. Sinbad and Sokurah split their forces. Sinbad and his men find the cyclops&#x27; treasure cave, but are captured by one of the creatures and locked in a wooden cage. Instead of helping them, Sokurah retrieves the magic lamp, but is chased by the cyclops, who kills three of the men. With Parisa&#x27;s aid, Sinbad manages to escape, then blinds the one-eyed creature and lures it off the edge of a cliff to its death. Sinbad decides to hold on to the lamp until Parisa is returned to normal size.

Sokurah leads Sinbad and his starving men to the nesting place of the giant Rocs. Out of hunger, Sinbad&#x27;s men try to break open a Roc egg, causing it to hatch, but the newborn chick is killed by the men and roasted for food. While the men are eating, Parisa enters the magic lamp and befriends Barani, the childlike genie inside, who tells her how to summon him in exchange for her promise of his freedom. The parent Roc returns and slays the men. Sinbad tries to summon the genie, but he is grabbed by the Roc, who takes flight, and drops him, unconscious, into its nearby nest. Sokurah kills Harufa and abducts the princess, taking her to his underground fortress.

Sinbad awakens and rubs the magic lamp, summoning Barani, who takes Sinbad to Sokurah&#x27;s fortress and helps him evade the chained dragon that stands guard. Sinbad reaches Sokurah, who restores the princess to normal. When Sinbad refuses to hand over the lamp, the magician animates a skeleton warrior, which Sinbad fights and destroys. With the help of the genie, Sinbad and Parisa make their way out of the cave, stopping to destroy the lamp by throwing it into a pool of lava, thus freeing Barani.

Leaving the cave, they encounter another cyclops. Sinbad releases the dragon, which fights and kills the creature. Sinbad and Parisa make their escape, but Sokurah orders the dragon to hunt them down. Sinbad heads to the beach, where his men have readied the giant crossbow, and they use it to kill the dragon. The dying dragon collapses on Sokurah, crushing him to death. Sinbad, Parisa, and the remaining crew depart for Baghdad. They are joined by Barani, now human, who has appointed himself Sinbad&#x27;s cabin boy. In a final act of magic as he was being freed, Barani filled the captain&#x27;s cabin with the treasure from the cyclops&#x27; cave, a wedding gift to Sinbad and Parisa.

==Cast==

==Production==

Schneer announced the production in June 1957. It was a co-production between his company, Morningstar, and Columbia Pictures.

The leads, Kerwin Mathews and Kathryn Grant were under contract to Columbia. Schneer left for Europe to scout locations on 15 July. Filming started the following month in Granada, Spain.

It took Ray Harryhausen 11 months to complete the full color, widescreen stop-motion animation sequences for &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;. Harryhausen&#x27;s &quot;Dynamation&quot; label was used for the first time on this film.

Harryhausen gave the cyclops a horn, goat legs, and cloven hooves, an idea based upon the concept of the Greek god Pan. He lifted much of the creature&#x27;s design (for example the torso, chest, arms, poise and style of movement) from his concept of the Ymir (the Venusian creature from his earlier &quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot;). He used the same armature for both figures; to do this, he had to cannibalize the Ymir, removing the latter&#x27;s latex body.

Harryhausen researched the cobra-woman sequence (when Sakourah entertains the Caliph and the Sultan) by watching a belly dancer in Beirut, Lebanon. During the performance, Harryhausen says, &quot;smoke was coming up my jacket. I thought I was on fire! It turned out the gentleman behind me was smoking a hookah!&quot; The cyclops is the film&#x27;s most popular character, but Harryhausen&#x27;s personal favorite was the cobra-woman, a combination of Princess Parisa&#x27;s maid, Sadi, and a cobra.
The film&#x27;s original script had a climax that involved two cyclops fighting. In the final version, however, the climactic battle featured a single cyclops versus a dragon. The model of the dragon was more than three feet long and was very difficult to animate; the fight sequence took nearly three weeks for Harryhausen to complete. Originally, it was planned to have the dragon breathing fire from its mouth during the entire sequence, but the cost was deemed too high. So the scenes where it does breathe fire, Harryhausen used a flamethrower, shooting out flames 30 to 40 feet against a night sky, then superimposed the filmed fire very near the dragon&#x27;s mouth. The dragon model used parts of the model of the Rhedosaurus from &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;.

The sword fight scene between Sinbad and the skeleton proved so popular with audiences that Harryhausen recreated and expanded the scene five years later, this time having a group of seven armed skeletons fight the Greek hero Jason and his men in 1963&#x27;s &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;.

The stop-motion cobra-woman figure used for the film was cannibalized 20 years later in order to make the Medusa figure in Harryhausen&#x27;s final film, &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;.

==Film score==
The music score for &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; was composed by Bernard Herrmann, better known at the time for his collaboration with the director Alfred Hitchcock, and composing the film score to Citizen Kane. Herrmann went on to write the scores for three other Harryhausen films: &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, &quot;The 3 Worlds of Gulliver&quot;, and &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;. Of the four, Harryhausen regarded the score for &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; as being the finest, due to the empathy Herrmann&#x27;s main title composition evoked for the subject matter.

The soundtrack producer Robert Townson, who re-recorded the score in 1998 with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, described the music as rich and vibrant, commenting: &quot;I would cite &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; as one of the scores which most validates film music as an art form and a forum where a great composer can write a great piece of music. As pure composition, I would place Sinbad beside anything else written this century and not worry about it being able to stand on its own&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; continues to be well-reviewed, with many critics holding the opinion that it is the best film of the &quot;Sinbad&quot; trilogy. The film carries a 100% approval rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 reviews with a weighted average score of 7.7/10, with several reviewers citing its nostalgic value. Mountain Xpress critic Ken Hanke, for example, calls it &quot;childhood memory stuff of the most compelling kind&quot;.

The film was released during Christmas 1958 to cash-in during the family holiday, but it continued to do well following the holiday period, becoming a sleeper hit. In its first three weeks the film grossed $3.5 million, including $500,000 at the Roxy Theatre in New York City. Its total rentals were more than $6 million worldwide.

Producer Edward Small, impressed with the film&#x27;s success, produced a fantasy film on his own in 1962, titled &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, reuniting the starring cast members of &quot;The 7th Voyage&quot;, Kerwin Mathews as Jack and Torin Thatcher as the evil sorcerer Pendragon.

<text>The Ben Day process is a printing and photoengraving technique for producing areas of gray or (with four-color printing) various colors by using fine patterns of ink on the paper. It was developed in 1879 by illustrator and printer Benjamin Henry Day Jr. (son of 19th-century publisher Benjamin Henry Day). The process is commonly described in terms of Ben Day dots, but other shapes can be used, such as parallel lines or textures.

Depending on the effect, color, or optical illusion needed, small colored dots are closely spaced, widely spaced, or overlapping. Magenta dots, for example, are widely spaced to create pink, or an interleaved pattern of cyan and yellow dots might be used to produce a medium green. The technique has been widely used in color comic books, especially in the mid 20th century, to inexpensively create shading and secondary colors.

The process differs from the halftone dots, which can vary continuously in size to produce gradations of shading or color, and are commonly produced from photographs. Ben Day dots are of equal size and distribution across a specific area, and are commonly applied to line art or graphic designs. To apply the dots, the artist would cut the appropriate shapes from transparent overlay sheets, which were available in a wide variety of dot size and distribution, to provide a range of tones to use. When photographically reproduced as a line cut for letterpress printing, the areas of Ben Day overlay provided the effect of tonal shading to the printing plate.

Ben Day dots have been used deliberately, usually to evoke their use in color comics. They were a hallmark of American artist Roy Lichtenstein, who enlarged and exaggerated them in many of his paintings and sculptures to evoke the printing technique used in the comic book illustrations he commonly copied. The animated trilogy &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; (2018–2024) uses a variety of visual styles, including illustrations with visible Ben Day dots.

<text>Benjamin Henry Day (April 10, 1810 – December 21, 1889) was an American newspaper publisher who founded the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, the first penny press newspaper in the United States, in 1833.

==Biography==
Day was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on April 10, 1810, to Henry Day, a hatter, and Mary Ely. Day started his printing career in 1824, at the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot;.

In 1835, Day&#x27;s &quot;Sun&quot; was responsible for publishing a story written by Richard Adams Locke about life on the Moon that was fictional, but was received by the general public as fact. The publicity of the article was widespread at the time and now is referred to as &quot;The Great Moon Hoax&quot;. Day is credited with stretching the truth that came to be known as sensationalism. Day is also credited for importing to the United States the London Plan, a system of newspaper distribution largely antiquated today in which the paper carriers buy newspapers in bulk from the publisher and sell the papers to the reading public for a profit.

Day sold the &quot;Sun&quot; to his brother-in-law Moses Yale Beach for $40,000 in 1838. Afterwards he started the &quot;True Sun&quot; in 1840, which had but a brief run. In 1842, he created the &quot;Brother Jonathan,&quot; the first illustrated weekly in the U.S., which he ran for twenty years.

Day constantly quarreled with George Wisner over the publication of abolitionist articles. Day considered himself democratic to Wisner&#x27;s extreme abolitionist standpoint.

From &quot;The New Yorker&quot;:

The American newspaper business as we know it was born on September 3, 1833, when a twenty-three-year-old publisher named Benjamin Day put out the first edition of the &quot;New York Sun&quot;. Whereas other papers sold for five or six cents, the &quot;Sun&quot; cost just a penny. For revenue, Day relied on advertising rather than on subscriptions. Above all, he revolutionized the way papers were distributed. He sold them to newsboys in lots of a hundred to hawk in the street. Before long, Day was the most important publisher in New York.
Day married Evelina Shepard (b. 1811) in 1831, and had four children: Henry (b. 1832), Mary Ely Day (1833–38), Benjamin Henry Day Jr. (1838–1916), the inventor of Ben-Day dots, and Clarence Shephard Day (1844–1927), a stockbroker (and father of author Clarence Shephard, Jr.).

<text>Magna is the brand name of an acrylic resin paint, developed by Leonard Bocour and sold by Bocour Artist Colors, Inc. in 1947. It is somewhat different from modern acrylic paint, as it is composed of pigments ground in an acrylic resin brought into emulsion through the use of solvents. Magna paint has more of a shine to it than most modern acrylic paint, a glossier finish. In 1960, Bocour Artist Colors developed a water-borne acrylic paint named Aqua-Tec. Modern acrylic paint is water-soluble, while Magna is miscible with turpentine or mineral spirits, though both can dry rapidly to a matte or glossy finish. It was used by artists such as Barnett Newman, Morris Louis, and Roy Lichtenstein. Roy Lichtenstein used magna with oil paints. 

==Modern Equivalent==
Golden Artist Colors produces Mineral Spirit Acrylics as a direct replacement for Magna. Any differences between the two are small, if any, and Roy Lichtenstein used them for that purpose. If anything, he thought the available color spectrum of MSA Conservation Color was better than Bocour&#x27;s Magna.

<text>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is a government agency within the United States Department of the Treasury that designs and produces a variety of security products for the United States government, most notable of which is Federal Reserve Notes (paper money) for the Federal Reserve, the nation&#x27;s central bank. In addition to paper currency, the BEP produces Treasury securities; military commissions and award certificates; invitations and admission cards; and many different types of identification cards, forms, and other special security documents for a variety of government agencies. The BEP&#x27;s role as printer of paper currency makes it one of two Treasury Department agencies involved in currency production. The other is the United States Mint, which mints coinage. With production facilities in Washington, D.C., and Fort Worth, Texas, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is the largest producer of government security documents in the United States.

== History ==

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has its origins in legislation enacted to help fund the Civil War. In July 1861, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue paper currency in lieu of coins due to the lack of funds needed to support the conflict. The paper notes were essentially government IOUs and were called Demand Notes because they were payable &quot;on demand&quot; in coin at certain Treasury facilities. At this time the government had no facility for the production of paper money so the American Bank Note Company and National Bank Note Company produced the Demand Notes in sheets of four. These sheets were then sent to the Treasury Department where dozens of clerks signed the notes and scores of workers cut the sheets and trimmed the notes by hand. The Second Legal Tender Act (July 11, 1862; ) authorized the Treasury Secretary to engrave and print notes at the Treasury Department; the design of which incorporates fine-line engraving, intricate geometric lathe work patterns, a Treasury seal, and engraved signatures to aid in counterfeit deterrence.

Initially, the currency processing operations in the Treasury were not formally organized. When Congress created the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and National Currency Bureau in 1863, currency-processing operations were nominally subordinated to that agency and designated the &quot;First Division, National Currency Bureau&quot;. For years, however, the currency operations were known by various semi-official labels, such as the &quot;Printing Bureau&quot;, &quot;Small Note Bureau&quot;, &quot;Currency Department&quot;, and &quot;Small Note Room&quot;. It was not until 1874 that the &quot;Bureau of Engraving and Printing&quot; was officially recognized in congressional legislation with a specific allocation of operating funds for the fiscal year of 1875.

From almost the very beginning of its operations, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing designed and printed a variety of products in addition to currency. As early as 1864, the offices which would later become the BEP made passports for the State Department and money orders for the Post Office Department. Passports are now produced by the Government Publishing Office. Other early items produced by the BEP included various government debt instruments, such as interest-bearing notes, refunding certificates, compound interest Treasury notes, and bonds. The production of postage stamps began in 1894, and for almost the next century the BEP was the sole producer of postage stamps in the country.

== Production ==

=== Postage stamp production ===
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing officially took over production of postage stamps for the United States government in July 1894. The first of the works printed by the BEP was placed on sale on July 18, 1894, and by the end of the first year of stamp production, the BEP had printed and delivered more than 2.1 billion stamps. The United States Postal Service switched purely to private postage stamp printers in 2005, ending 111 years of production by the Bureau. Starting in 2011 the United States Postal Service in-housed all postage stamp printing services.

=== Currency production ===
Plate capacity on power presses increased from four to eight notes per sheet in 1918 in order to meet the greatly expanded production requirements related to World War I.

With the redesign of currency in 1929, the first major change since paper currency was first issued in 1861, note design was not only standardized but note size was also significantly reduced. Due to this reduction in size, the Bureau was able to convert from eight-note printing plates to twelve-note plates. The redesign effort came about for several reasons, chief among them a reduction in paper costs and improved counterfeit deterrence through better public recognition of currency features.

A further increase in the number of notes per sheet was realized in 1952 after breakthrough developments in the production of non-offset inks. Beginning in 1943, the BEP experimented with new inks that dried faster, therefore obviating the need to place tissues between sheets to prevent ink from offsetting to other sheets. The faster drying ink also enabled printed sheets of backs to be kept damp until the faces were printed, thereby reducing distortion caused by wetting, drying, and re-wetting of the paper (sheets needed to be dampened before each printing).
By reducing the distortion that increases proportionally with the size of the sheet of paper, the Bureau was able to convert from 12-note printing plates to plates capable of printing 18 notes in 1952. Five years later in 1957, the Bureau began printing currency via the dry intaglio method that utilizes special paper and non-offset inks, enabling a further increase from 18 to 32 notes per sheet. Since 1968, all currency has been printed by means of the dry intaglio process, whereby wetting of the paper prior to printing is unnecessary. In this process, fine-line engravings are transferred to steel plates from which an impression is made on sheets of distinctive paper. Ink is applied to a plate containing 32 note impressions, which is then wiped clean, leaving ink in the engraved lines. The plate is pressed against the sheet of paper with such pressure as to actually press the paper into the lines of the plate to pick up the ink. Both faces and backs are printed in this manner – backs first. After the faces are printed, the sheets are then typographically overprinted with Treasury Seals and serial numbers.

During Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 10 cents per note.

== Locations ==
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has two locations: one in Washington, D.C., and another in Fort Worth, Texas.

=== District of Columbia location ===
The Washington facility consists of two adjacent buildings. The elder, considered the main building and located between 14th and 15th streets SW, was constructed in 1914. The architectural style of the main building is neoclassical. It has a steel superstructure with fireproof concrete, Indiana limestone, and granite trim exterior. The main façade of the building faces Raoul Wallenberg Place (15th St), the Tidal Basin, and the Jefferson Memorial, with stone columns spanning the length of the building&#x27;s front. The building is deep and high with four wings that extend back toward 14th Street. The building is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as Auditor&#x27;s Building Complex.

In May 1938, work was completed on an addition to the Washington, D.C., facility to accommodate increases in personnel and production. The annex building, as it is called, is located on 14th Street, between C and D streets SW, just opposite the main building. The building is long, wide, and made entirely of reinforced concrete with a limestone façade. The structure consists of a central backbone running from 14th Street to 13th Street with five wings extending north and south from the backbone.

The Washington, D.C., location offers a free 30-minute guided tour which features the various phases of currency production. Tours may be taken Monday through Friday. The Bureau is closed for all federal holidays and the week between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day.

=== Fort Worth location ===
In 1987, construction began on a second facility in Fort Worth, Texas. In addition to meeting increased production requirements, a western location was seen to serve as a contingency operation in case of emergencies in the DC metropolitan area; additionally, costs for transporting currency to Federal Reserve banks in San Francisco, Dallas, and Kansas City would be reduced. Currency production began in December 1990 at the Fort Worth facility, and the official dedication took place on April 26, 1991. Any currency printed at Fort Worth includes a small &quot;FW&quot;, usually located to the left of the bill&#x27;s face plate number, and most also have larger back plate numbers.

=== Historic locations ===
The Bureau moved into its own building in 1880 with the completion of a facility at 14th St. and Independence Ave. SW, now the Sidney Yates Building. An addition was built on the south side of the building in 1891. The Bureau relocated to its present Washington location, just south of the original building, in 1914.

=== Future locations ===
On April 27, 2022, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced that the BEP would move from their historic Washington, D.C. location to Beltsville, MD at the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC). The U.S. Department of Treasury was transferred ownership of 114 acres within BARC from the Department of Agriculture for a future facility estimated to be completed in early 2027.

== BEP Police ==

The Bureau operates a police department, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Police Force, that protects BEP personnel and facilities. The BEP Police are responsible for enforcing federal and local laws, Treasury Department rules and regulations, Washington, DC Criminal Code through a Memorandum of Understanding, and Texas Criminal Code. In 2004, 234 Police officers were employed.

<text>Immunotherapy or biological therapy is the treatment of disease by activating or suppressing the immune system. Immunotherapy is designed to elicit or amplify an immune response are classified as &quot;activation immunotherapies,&quot; while immunotherapies that reduce or suppress are classified as &quot;suppression immunotherapies&quot;. Immunotherapy is under preliminary research for its potential to treat various forms of cancer.

Cell-based immunotherapies are effective for some cancers. Immune effector cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes work together to defend the body against cancer by targeting abnormal antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Vaccine-induced immunity to COVID-19 relies mostly on an immunomodulatory T-cell response.

Therapies such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferons, imiquimod and cellular membrane fractions from bacteria are licensed for medical use. Others including IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, various chemokines, synthetic cytosine phosphate-guanosine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides and glucans are involved in clinical and preclinical studies.
==Immunomodulators==
Immunomodulators are the active agents of immunotherapy. They are a diverse array of recombinant, synthetic, and natural preparations.
==Activation immunotherapies==

===Cancer===
Cancer treatment used to be focused on killing or removing cancer cells and tumours, with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation. In 2018 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo &quot;for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.&quot; Cancer immunotherapy attempts to stimulate the immune system to destroy tumours. A variety of strategies are in use or are undergoing research and testing. Randomized controlled studies in different cancers resulting in significant increase in survival and disease free period have been reported and its efficacy is enhanced by 20–30% when cell-based immunotherapy is combined with conventional treatment methods.

One of the oldest forms of cancer immunotherapy is the use of BCG vaccine, which was originally to vaccinate against tuberculosis and later was found to be useful in the treatment of bladder cancer. BCG immunotherapy induces both local and systemic immune responses. The mechanisms by which BCG immunotherapy mediates tumor immunity have been widely studied, but they are still not completely understood.

The use of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy was first introduced in 1997 with rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody for treatment of B cell lymphoma. Since then several monoclonal antibodies have been approved for treatment of various haematological malignancies as well as for solid tumours.

The extraction of G-CSF lymphocytes from the blood and expanding in vitro against a tumour antigen before reinjecting the cells with appropriate stimulatory cytokines. The cells then destroy the tumour cells that express the antigen. Topical immunotherapy utilizes an immune enhancement cream (imiquimod) which produces interferon, causing the recipient&#x27;s killer T cells to destroy warts, actinic keratoses, basal cell cancer, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, squamous cell cancer, cutaneous lymphoma, and superficial malignant melanoma. Injection immunotherapy (&quot;intralesional&quot; or &quot;intratumoural&quot;) uses mumps, candida, the HPV vaccine or trichophytin antigen injections to treat warts (HPV induced tumours).

Adoptive cell transfer has been tested on lung and other cancers, with greatest success achieved in melanoma.

====Dendritic cell-based pump-priming or vaccination====

Dendritic cells (DC) can be stimulated to activate a cytotoxic response towards an antigen. Dendritic cells, a type of antigen-presenting cell, are harvested from the person needing the immunotherapy. These cells are then either pulsed with an antigen or tumour lysate or transfected with a viral vector, causing them to display the antigen. Upon transfusion into the person, these activated cells present the antigen to the effector lymphocytes (CD4+ helper T cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and B cells). This initiates a cytotoxic response against tumour cells expressing the antigen (against which the adaptive response has now been primed). The first FDA-approved cell-based immunotherapy, the cancer vaccine Sipuleucel-T is one example of this approach. The Immune Response Corporation (IRC) developed this immunotherapy and licensed the technology to Dendreon, which obtained FDA clearance.

The current approaches for DC-based vaccination are mainly based on antigen loading on &quot;in vitro&quot;-generated DCs from monocytes or CD34+ cells, activating them with different TLR ligands, cytokine combinations, and injecting them back to the patients. The &quot;in vivo&quot; targeting approaches comprise administering specific cytokines (e.g., Flt3L, GM-CSF) and targeting the DCs with antibodies to C-type lectin receptors or agonistic antibodies (e.g., anti-CD40) that are conjugated with antigen of interest. Multiple, next-generation anti-CD40 platforms are being actively developed. Future approach may target DC subsets based on their specifically expressed C-type lectin receptors or chemokine receptors. Another potential approach is the generation of genetically engineered DCs from induced pluripotent stem cells and use of neoantigen-loaded DCs for inducing better clinical outcome.

====T-cell adoptive transfer====
Adoptive cell transfer &quot;in vitro&quot; cultivates autologous, extracted T cells for later transfusion.

Alternatively, Genetically engineered T cells are created by harvesting T cells and then infecting the T cells with a retrovirus that contains a copy of a T cell receptor (TCR) gene that is specialised to recognise tumour antigens. The virus integrates the receptor into the T cells&#x27; genome. The cells are expanded non-specifically and/or stimulated. The cells are then reinfused and produce an immune response against the tumour cells. The technique has been tested on refractory stage IV metastatic melanomas and advanced skin cancer. The first FDA-approved CAR-T drug, Kymriah, used this approach. To obtain the clinical and commercial supply of this CAR-T, Novartis purchased the manufacturing plant, the distribution system and hired the production team that produced Sipuleucel-T developed by Dendreon and the Immune Response Corporation.

Whether T cells are genetically engineered or not, before re-infusion, lympho-depletion of the recipient is required to eliminate regulatory T cells as well as unmodified, endogenous lymphocytes that compete with the transferred cells for homeostatic cytokines. Lymphodepletion may be achieved by myeloablative chemotherapy, to which total body irradiation may be added for greater effect. Transferred cells multiplied &quot;in vivo&quot; and persisted in peripheral blood in many people, sometimes representing levels of 75% of all CD8+ T cells at 6–12 months after infusion. , clinical trials for metastatic melanoma were ongoing at multiple sites. Clinical responses to adoptive transfer of T cells were observed in patients with metastatic melanoma resistant to multiple immunotherapies.

==== Checkpoint inhibitors ====

Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies are the two types of checkpoint inhibitors currently available to patients. The approval of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies for human use has already resulted in significant improvements in disease outcomes for various cancers.

Although these molecules were originally discovered as molecules playing a role in T cell activation or apoptosis, subsequent preclinical research showed their important role in the maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are approved to treat some patients with a variety of cancer types, including melanoma, breast cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer head and neck cancer, or Hodgkin lymphoma.

These therapies have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy as they showed for the first time in many years of research in metastatic melanoma, which is considered one of the most immunogenic human cancers, an improvement in overall survival, with an increasing group of patients benefiting long-term from these treatments, although caution remains needed for specific subgroups.

The next generation of checkpoint inhibitors targets other receptors such as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3), and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT). Antibodies against these receptors have been evaluated in clinical studies, but have not yet been approved for widespread use.

==Immune enhancement therapy==
Autologous immune enhancement therapy use a person&#x27;s own peripheral blood-derived natural killer cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, epithelial cells and other relevant immune cells are expanded &quot;in vitro&quot; and then re-infused. The therapy has been tested against hepatitis C, chronic fatigue syndrome and HHV6 infection.

==Suppression immunotherapies==

Immune suppression dampens an abnormal immune response in autoimmune diseases or reduces a normal immune response to prevent rejection of transplanted organs or cells.

===Immunosuppressive drugs===
Immunosuppressive drugs can be used to control the immune system with organ transplantation and with autoimmune disease. Immune responses depend on lymphocyte proliferation. Lymphocyte proliferation is the multiplication of lymphocyte cells used to fight and remember foreign invaders. Cytostatic drugs are a type of immunosuppressive drug that aids in slowing down the growth of rapidly dividing cells. Another example of an immunosuppressive drug is Glucocorticoids which are more specific inhibitors of lymphocyte activation. Glucocorticoids work by emulating actions of natural actions of the body&#x27;s adrenal glands to help suppress the immune system, which is helpful with autoimmune diseases|, Alternatively, inhibitors of immunophilins more specifically target T lymphocyte activation, the process by which T-lymphocytes stimulate and begin to respond to a specific antigen, There is also Immunosuppressive antibodies which target steps in the immune response to prevent the body from attacking its tissues, which is a problem with autoimmune diseases, There are various other drugs that modulate immune responses and can be used to induce immune regulation. It was observed in a preclinical trial that regulation of the immune system by small immunosuppressive molecules such as vitamin D, dexamethasone, and curcumin could be helpful in preventing or treating chronic inflation. Given that the molecules are administered under a low-dose regimen and subcutaneously. A study provides a promising preclinical demonstration of the effectiveness and ease of preparation of Valrubicin-loaded immunoliposomes (Val-ILs) as a novel nanoparticle technology to target immunosuppressive cells. Val-ILs have the potential to be used as a precise and effective therapy based on targeted vesicle-mediated cell death of immunosuppressive cells. 

===Immune tolerance===

The body naturally does not launch an immune system attack on its own tissues. Models generally identify CD4+ T-cells at the centre of the autoimmune response. Loss of T-cell tolerance then unleashes B-cells and other immune effector cells on to the target tissue. The ideal tolerogenic therapy would target the specific T-cell clones co-ordinating the autoimmune attack.

Immune tolerance therapies seek to reset the immune system so that the body stops mistakenly attacking its own organs or cells in autoimmune disease or accepts foreign tissue in organ transplantation. A recent therapeutic approach is the infusion of regulatory immune cells into transplant recipients. The transfer of regulatory immune cells has the potential to inhibit the activity of effector.

Creating immune tolerance reduces or eliminates the need for lifelong immunosuppression and attendant side effects. It has been tested on transplantations, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune disorders.
=== Allergen immunotherapy ===
Immunotherapy can also be used to treat allergies. While allergy treatments (such as antihistamines or corticosteroids) treat allergic symptoms, immunotherapy can reduce sensitivity to allergens, lessening its severity. Allergen immunotherapy can also be referred to as allergen desensitization or hypo-sensitization. Immunotherapy may produce long-term benefits. Immunotherapy is partly effective in some people and ineffective in others, but it offers people with allergies a chance to reduce or stop their symptoms.

Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy was first introduced in 1911 through the hypothesis that people with hay fever were sensitive to pollen from grass. A process was developed to create an extract by drawing out timothy pollen in distilled water and then boiling it. This was injected into patients in increasing doses to help alleviate symptoms. 

Allergen Immunotherapy is indicated for people who are extremely allergic or who cannot avoid specific allergens and when there is evidence of an IgE-mediated reaction that correlates with allergen symptoms. These IgE-mediated reactions can be identified via a blood IgE test or skin testing. If a specific IgE antibody is negative, there is no evidence that allergen immunotherapy will be effective for that patient.

However, there are risks associated with allergen immunotherapy as it is the administration of an agent the patient is known to be highly allergic to. Patients are at increased risk of fatal anaphylaxis, local reaction at the site of injection, or life-threatening systemic allergic reactions.

A promising approach to treat food allergies is the use of oral immunotherapy (OIT). OIT consists in a gradual exposure to increasing amounts of allergen can lead to the majority of subjects tolerating doses of food sufficient to prevent reaction on accidental exposure. Dosages increase over time, as the person becomes desensitized. This technique has been tested on infants to prevent peanut allergies.

==Helminthic therapies==

Whipworm ova (&quot;Trichuris suis&quot;) and hookworm (&quot;Necator americanus&quot;) have been tested for immunological diseases and allergies, and have proved beneficial on multiple fronts, yet it is not entirely understood. Scientists have found that the immune response triggered by the burrowing of hookworm larvae to pass through the lungs and blood so the production of mast cells and specific antibodies are now present. They also reduce inflammation or responses ties to autoimmune diseases, but despite this, the hookworm&#x27;s effects are considered to be negative typically. Helminthic therapy has been investigated as a treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, Crohn&#x27;s, allergies and asthma. While there is much to be learned about this, many researchers think that the change in the immune response is thanks to the parasites shifting to a more anti-inflammatory or regulatory system, which would in turn decrease inflammation and self inflicted immune damage as seen in Crohn&#x27;s and multiple sclerosis. Specifically, MS patients saw lower relapse rates and calmer symptoms in some cases when experimenting with helminthic therapy. Hypothesized mechanisms include re-polarisation of the Th1 / Th2 response and modulation of dendritic cell function. The helminths downregulate the pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines, interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), while promoting the production of regulatory Th2 cytokines such as IL-10, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13.

Co-evolution with helminths has shaped some of the genes associated with interleukin expression and immunological disorders, such Crohn&#x27;s, ulcerative colitis and celiac disease. Helminths&#x27; relationship to humans as hosts should be classified as mutualistic or symbiotic. In some ways, the relationship is symbiotic because the worms themselves need the host (humans) for survival, because this body supplies them with nutrients and a home. From another perspective, it could be reasoned that it is mutualistic, being that the above information about benefits in autoimmune disorders continues to remain true and supported. Also, some say that the worms can regulate gut bacteria. Another possibility is one of this being a parasitic relationship, arguing that the possible risks of anemia and other disorders outweighs the benefits, yet this is significantly less supported, with the research alluding to the mutualistic and symbiotic approach being much more likely.

<doc id="226539" wikidata="Q3182436" url="?curid=226539" title="John Savage (Nova Scotia politician)">
<text>John Patrick Savage (May 28, 1932 – May 13, 2003) was a Welsh-born Canadian physician and politician. Savage was the 23rd premier of Nova Scotia between 1993 and 1997. He was born in Wales, and educated in both the United Kingdom and Ireland. He immigrated to Canada in 1967 and was a noted family physician in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. He became the mayor of Dartmouth in 1985, and won re-election twice. He then became the leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in 1992 and stepped down as mayor. In 1993, he defeated the incumbent provincial government and became premier. Savage was a controversial premier, bringing in many reforms in taxation, regional government, and government hiring practices. He resigned as premier in 1997 due to his low approval ratings in public polls. He died of cancer at the age of 70 in 2003. He was the father of Mike Savage, former mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality.

==Early life==
Born in Newport, Wales, he was the son of an Irish Roman Catholic doctor father and a Welsh Baptist housewife mother. He attended school at Prior Park College, Bath, before attending Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast to become a physician.

== Nova Scotia ==
He was generally unhappy with the United Kingdom&#x27;s government-run healthcare system known as the National Health Service. When he saw an advertisement for doctors in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, Savage decided to pack up his family and move across the ocean to continue his medical practice in 1967. He made a name for himself as the &quot;hippie doctor&quot; in the 1970s, due to his beard and progressive health stances. By setting up a detox centre — and a free clinic in the economically disadvantaged and mostly black community of North Preston — he assured his reputation as a left-winger.

He started his political life running for federal office in the Halifax area in the 1970s. He was defeated twice as a federal Liberal Party candidate. In 1985, he ran successfully to become the mayor of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, where he lived. He was re-elected as mayor in both 1988 and 1991.

== Premier of Nova Scotia==
The Nova Scotia Liberal Party had its annual general meeting in Dartmouth on February 29, 1992. Savage attended a session of the meeting to bring greetings from the City of Dartmouth, in his capacity as its mayor, but didn&#x27;t realize that the party&#x27;s rank and file were about to oust their long-time leader, Vince McLean. He was approached to run for the Liberal leadership and took a leave of absence from his mayoral duties. The election was held by computerized telephone balloting, and he won on the second ballot in June 1992.

On May 25, 1993, Savage defeated sitting Premier Donald Cameron and the governing Progressive Conservatives in the 1993 provincial election, winning 40 of the legislature&#x27;s 52 seats.

During his term as premier, and saddled with huge operating debts left by the previous government and declining equalization payments from the federal government of Jean Chrétien, he became a tough fiscal conservative, balancing the provincial budget in 1996 for the first time since 1978.

In doing so, he imposed 4 day layoff of thousands of civil servants. Other programs, such as constructing a toll highway, municipal amalgamations by creating the Cape Breton Regional Municipality and the Halifax Regional Municipality, and the implementation of the Harmonized Sales Tax were initiated under his watch.

His government also led the country in the creation of tougher anti-smoking legislation, consolidation of school boards and local health authorities, creation of the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, the establishment of one of the most modern emergency health services in North America along with province-wide emergency field communications systems, modernizing its vocational schools to form an independent NSCC, and he waged a tough and ultimately successful fight against an entrenched patronage system in the provincial Department of Transportation and Public Works, as well as within his own political party.

Savage&#x27;s detractors labelled him as inexperienced and stubborn. Faced with increasing discontent from within his own party over some of his anti-patronage policies, and after surviving a July 1995 leadership review vote, he resigned as premier in 1997. In its editorial page on March 22, 1997, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, after citing his list of reforms, called him &quot;the best premier in a generation,&quot; and berated both Liberal party members and the public for forcing him to resign.

== Later life and death ==
After Savage resigned, he and his wife Margaret traveled to Africa to perform missionary work. They worked in The Gambia, providing HIV/AIDS education to youth. 

In 2001, he acknowledged he had stomach cancer, which had metastasized. He died on May 13, 2003. Just three days before his death, he was made an officer of the Order of Canada. He died in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, about six weeks after his wife&#x27;s death, from bowel cancer. 

Savage and his wife had seven children, with their son Mike Savage following in his father&#x27;s footsteps and becoming the mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality in 2012.

<doc id="226540" wikidata="Q11181178" url="?curid=226540" title="Spherocytosis">
<text>Spherocytosis is the presence of spherocytes in the blood, i.e. erythrocytes (red blood cells) that are sphere-shaped rather than bi-concave disk shaped as normal. Spherocytes are found in all hemolytic anemias to some degree. Hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are characterized by having &quot;only&quot; spherocytes.

==Causes==
Spherocytes are found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis, but the former would have a positive direct Coombs test and the latter would not. The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply (auto-hemolysis). A complete blood count (CBC) may show increased reticulocytes, a sign of increased red blood cell production, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit.
The term &quot;non-hereditary spherocytosis&quot; is occasionally used, albeit rarely.

Lists of causes:
* Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia
* Cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia/paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria
* Acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions
* ABO hemolytic diseases of newborn/Rh hemolytic disease of newborn
* Hereditary spherocytosis
* Intravenous water infusion or drowning (fresh water)
* Hypophosphatemia
* Bartonellosis
* Snake bites
* Hyposplenism
* Rh-null phenotype

==Pathophysiology==
Spherocytosis most often refers to hereditary spherocytosis. This is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the proteins of the red blood cell cytoskeleton, including spectrin, ankyrin, Band 3, or Protein 4.2. Because the cell skeleton has a defect, the blood cell contracts to a sphere, which is its most surface tension efficient and least flexible configuration. Though the spherocytes have a smaller surface area through which oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged, they in themselves perform adequately to maintain healthy oxygen supplies. However, they have a high osmotic fragility—when placed into water, they are more likely to burst than normal red blood cells. These cells are more prone to physical degradation.

In short, spherocytosis has an attribute of decreased cell deformability.

==Diagnosis==

Spherocytosis can be diagnosed in Peripheral blood film by seeing spherical red blood cells rather than biconcave. Because spherical red blood cells are more prone to lysis in water (because they lack some proteins in their cytoskeleton) there will be increased osmotic fragility on acidified glycerol lysis test.

==Treatment==
Treatment may vary depending on the cause of the condition. In the case of hereditary spherocytosis, although research is ongoing, at this point there is no cure for the genetic defect that causes hereditary spherocytosis. Current management focuses on interventions that limit the severity of the disease. Treatment options for this type of spherocytosis include:
* Splenectomy: As in non-hereditary spherocytosis, acute symptoms of anemia and hyperbilirubinemia indicate treatment with blood transfusions or exchanges and chronic symptoms of anemia and an enlarged spleen indicate dietary supplementation of folic acid and splenectomy, the surgical removal of the spleen. Splenectomy is indicated for moderate to severe cases, but not mild cases. To decrease the risk of sepsis, post-splenectomy spherocytosis patients require immunization against the influenza virus, encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and meningococcus, and prophylactic antibiotic treatment. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, such as penicillin, remains controversial.
* Partial splenectomy: Since the spleen is important for protecting against encapsulated organisms, sepsis caused by encapsulated organisms is a possible complication of splenectomy. The option of partial splenectomy may be considered in the interest of preserving immune function. Research on outcomes is currently limited, but favorable.
* Surgical removal of the gallbladder may be necessary.

<doc id="226545" wikidata="Q4773900" url="?curid=226545" title="Anthropological theories of value">
<text>Anthropological theories of value attempt to expand on the traditional theories of value used by economists or ethicists. They are often broader in scope than the theories of value of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, etc. usually including sociological, political, institutional, and historical perspectives (transdisciplinarity). Some have influenced feminist economics.

The basic premise is that economic activities can only be fully understood in the context of the society that creates them. The concept of &quot;value&quot; is a social construct, and as such is defined by the culture using the concept. Yet we can gain some insights into modern patterns of exchange, value, and wealth by examining previous societies. An anthropological approach to economic processes allows us to critically examine the cultural biases inherent in the principles of modern economics. Anthropological linguistics is a related field that looks at the terms we use to describe economic relations and the ecologies they are set within. Many anthropological economists (or economic anthropologists) are reacting against what they see as the portrayal of modern society as an economic machine that merely produces and consumes.

Marcel Mauss and Bronisław Malinowski for example wrote about objects that circulate in society without being consumed. Georges Bataille wrote about objects that are destroyed, but not consumed. Bruce Owens talks about objects of value that are neither circulating nor consumed (e.g. gold reserves, warehoused paintings, family heirlooms).

== Value as meaning-making ==
David Graeber attempts to synthesize the insights of Karl Marx and Marcel Mauss. He sees value as a model for human meaning-making. Starting with Marxist definitions of consumption and production, he introduces Mauss&#x27;s idea of &quot;objects that are not consumed&quot; and posits that the majority of human behavior consists of activities that would not be properly categorized as either consumption or production.

=== List of things that are neither consumption nor production ===

A list of things that are neither consumption nor production in 2003 includes those human activities that are not consumption, in the narrow sense of simply purchasing something, and are not production, in the sense of creating or modifying something intended for sale or exchange, namely:
*cooking a meal
*extinguishing a fire
*dressing and undressing
*applying makeup
*watching television
*playing in a band
*falling in love
*reading
*listening to music
*going to a museum or gallery
*taking a photograph
*gardening
*writing
*conducting a coming of age ceremony
*going window shopping
*exercising
*acting
*turning around in a circle
*teaching
*having an argument
*playing games
*having sex
*attending a religious service
*looking at old photos
*critiquing art
== Criticisms ==
Some behaviors that do not appear to fall under the categories of consumption or production can be interpreted as complex or indirect examples of consumption or production. For example, writing might be treated as the production of material for someone to consume through reading, and might be performed for some return in value (such as prestige). Other behaviors may be usefully interpreted as analogous to consumption or production. For example, window shoppers can be seen as consuming a product by spending attention on shop displays, which are produced by marketers. In addition, some behaviors that do not appear to match the description of consumption can be understood as replacements for consumption. For example, a person that cooks a meal instead of purchasing it can be seen as having paid for that meal through labor instead of wages. Gary Becker&#x27;s household production functions and similar topics note that people often purchase goods and then combine them with time to produce something that has meaning or practicality to them (which produce utility).

<text>Brodick ( , (&quot;Castle Beach&quot;) or &quot;Breadhaig&quot;) is the main village on the Isle of Arran, in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland. It is halfway along the east coast of the island, in Brodick Bay below Goat Fell, the tallest mountain on Arran. The name is derived from the Norse &quot;breda-vick&quot; meaning &quot;Broad Bay&quot;.

The harbour receives the main ferry between Arran and the mainland via Ardrossan. Brodick Castle is a former residence of the Dukes of Hamilton.

Brodick is one of the largest villages on the island and is seen as the main hub due to the ferry terminal which connects the island to the mainland. It is host to many homes, hotels and shops, the health centre, nursing home, heritage museum, tourist information centre, Brodick Castle, public beach, park and an 18-hole golf course.

== Transport ==
Brodick is home to Arran&#x27;s main ferry terminus, which connects to Ardrossan and the national rail network. Operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, &amp; serves the island year-round. The crossing, which takes less than an hour, is one of the busiest on the CalMac network, and dolphins and basking sharks are occasionally spotted en route.
A second, smaller ferry – – sails from Lochranza to Claonaig on the Kintyre peninsula between March and October. During the winter period, the vessel operates to and from Tarbert instead.

The village has seen investment recently, with £30 million being spent on a new pier and passenger terminal capable of handling two vessels at once, increasing capacity.

In addition to the new ferry terminal, which was formally opened by Derek Mackay MSP on 12 April 2018, the island is expected to get two new dual-fuelled ferries. The first, , initially planned to enter service in summer 2018, but didn&#x27;t enter service in January 2025. A sister is expected to follow in late 2025. The problems around the delivery of these vessels has become a Scottish political scandal dubbed the Ferry Fiasco.

The village is connected to all parts of the island by road, including the villages of Lamlash and Whiting Bay to the south, Lochranza to the north and Blackwaterfoot to the west.

An upgraded bus terminal, opened at the ferry terminal in early 2017, is a hub for transport on the island, providing many bus services.

== Village ==
Brodick is a popular holiday destination and a base for hill-walking. Tourism provides much of the village&#x27;s economic base. There are many family-owned and independent businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, shops, bed and breakfast establishments, guest houses and outdoor activities. There is also a brewery (located in nearby Cladach), a sports and leisure complex, and an 18-hole golf course. 

The village of Brodick is the largest settlement on the island (although Lamlash has a larger population), and is seen as the centre of economic activity due to the many businesses that are located around the village. These include the 22 bedroom Douglas Hotel &amp; Bar, and the Auchrannie Spa and Resort, which comprises two 4-star hotels with 85 rooms and thirty 5-star self-catering lodges along with a spa, two leisure centres, and adventure company and more on site.

Brodick has a range of amenities, including a primary school, a village hall, a library, a church, a sports park, a health centre, and a beach. Brodick also has a large Co-op supermarket in the heart of the village, along with a smaller Co-op convenience store located at Invercloy.

Brodick has a variety of businesses, including hairdressers, estate agents, a post office, gift shops, a bakery, a chocolate shop, and a bike rental store. The village is home to numerous cafes, bars, and restaurants.

The high school, council offices, Highlands and Islands University Resource Centre and hospital can all be found in Lamlash, located to the south.

The largest peak on the island, Goat Fell, overlooks the village and Brodick Bay. Reaching above sea-level, it is one of the most popular hiking routes in Scotland.


== Brodick Castle ==

Brodick Castle was previously a seat of the Dukes of Hamilton, but is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland. A new Kids adventure section of the park opened in July 2017.

<doc id="226552" wikidata="Q578905" url="?curid=226552" title="Antinomianism">
<text>Antinomianism (Ancient Greek: ἀντί [&quot;anti&quot;] &quot;against&quot; and νόμος [&quot;nomos&quot;] &quot;law&quot;) is any view which rejects laws or legalism and argues against moral, religious or social norms (Latin: mores), or is at least considered to do so. The term has both religious and secular meanings.
In some Christian belief systems, an antinomian is one who takes the principle of salvation by faith and divine grace to the point of asserting that the saved are not bound to follow the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments. Antinomians believe that faith alone guarantees eternal security in heaven, regardless of one&#x27;s actions.

The distinction between antinomian and other Christian views on moral law is that antinomians believe that obedience to the law is motivated by an internal principle flowing from belief rather than from any external compulsion. Antinomianism has been considered to teach that believers have a &quot;license to sin&quot; and that future sins do not require repentance. Johannes Agricola, to whom Antinomianism was first attributed, stated &quot;If you sin, be happy, it should have no consequence.&quot;

Examples of antinomians being confronted by the religious establishment include Martin Luther&#x27;s critique of antinomianism, the Ranters of the English Civil War, and the Antinomian Controversy of the seventeenth-century Massachusetts Bay Colony. The charge of antinomianism has been levelled at Reformed, Baptist and some Nondenominational churches.
By extension, the word &quot;antinomian&quot; is used to describe views in religions other than Christianity:
* the 10th century Sufi mystic al-Hallaj was accused of antinomianism
* the term is also used to describe certain practices or traditions in Frankism
* aspects of Vajrayana and Tantra that include sexual rituals are sometimes described as &quot;antinomian&quot; for Buddhism and Hinduism.

==Christian views on antinomianism==
Antinomianism has been a point of doctrinal contention in the history of Christianity. At its root is an argument between salvation through faith alone and on the basis of good works or works of mercy.

The term &quot;antinomianism&quot; was coined by Martin Luther during the Reformation to criticize extreme interpretations of the new Lutheran soteriology. In the 18th century, John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist tradition, severely attacked antinomianism.

According to some Christian denominations, moral laws (as opposed to civil or ceremonial laws) are derivative of what St. Paul indirectly refers to as natural law (Rm 2.14–15). According to this point of view, the Mosaic law has authority only insofar as it reflects the commands of Christ and the natural law. Christian sects and theologians who believe that they are less constrained by laws than critics consider customary are often called &quot;antinomian&quot; by those critics. Thus, classic Methodist commentator Adam Clarke held, &quot;The Gospel proclaims liberty from the ceremonial law, but binds you still faster under the moral law. To be freed from the ceremonial law is the Gospel liberty; to pretend freedom from the moral law is Antinomianism.&quot;

===Antinomianism in Gnosticism===
The term &quot;antinomian&quot; came into use in the sixteenth century; however, the doctrine itself can be traced in the teaching of earlier beliefs. Early Gnostic sects were accused of failing to follow the Mosaic Law in a manner that suggests the modern term &quot;antinomian&quot;. Most Gnostic sects did not accept the Old Testament moral law. For example, the Manichaeans held that their spiritual being was unaffected by the action of matter and regarded carnal sins as being, at worst, forms of bodily disease.

Marcion of Sinope was the founder of Marcionism which rejected the Hebrew Bible in its entirety. Marcion considered the God portrayed in the Bible to be a lesser deity, a demiurge, and he claimed that the law of Moses was contrived.
Such deviations from the moral law were criticized by proto-orthodox rivals of the Gnostics, who ascribed various aberrant and licentious acts to them. A biblical example of such criticism can be found in , which criticizes the Nicolaitans, possibly an early Gnostic sect.

===Lutheran views===
The term &quot;antinomianism&quot; was coined by Martin Luther during the Reformation, to criticize extreme interpretations of the new Lutheran soteriology. The Lutheran Church benefited from early antinomian controversies by becoming more precise in distinguishing between law and gospel and justification and sanctification. Martin Luther developed 258 theses during his six antinomian disputations, which continue to provide doctrinal guidance to Lutherans today.

Upon hearing that he was being charged with the rejection of the Old Testament moral law, Luther responded: &quot;And truly, I wonder exceedingly, how it came to be imputed to me, that I should reject the Law or Ten Commandments, there being extant so many of my own expositions (and those of several sorts) upon the Commandments, which also are daily expounded, and used in our Churches, to say nothing of the Confession and Apology, and other books of ours.&quot; In his &quot;Introduction to Romans,&quot; Luther stated that saving faith is,
 The Lutheran Churches label antinomianism as a heresy.

====First antinomian controversy====
As early as 1525, Johannes Agricola advanced his idea, in his commentary on Luke, that the law was a futile attempt of God to work the restoration of mankind. He maintained that non-Christians were still held to the Mosaic law, while Christians were entirely free from it, being under the Gospel alone. He viewed sin as a malady or impurity rather than an offense that rendered the sinner guilty and damnable before God. The sinner was the subject of God&#x27;s pity rather than of his wrath. To Agricola, the purpose of repentance was to abstain from evil rather than the contrition of a guilty conscience. The law had no role in repentance, which came about after one came to faith, and repentance was caused by the knowledge of the love of God alone.

In contrast, Philipp Melanchthon urged that repentance must precede faith and that knowledge of the moral law is needed to produce repentance. He later wrote in the Augsburg Confession that repentance has two parts. &quot;One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that for Christ&#x27;s sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors.&quot;

Shortly after Melanchthon drew up the &quot;1527 Articles of Visitation&quot; in June, Agricola began to be verbally aggressive toward him, but Martin Luther succeeded in smoothing out the difficulty at Torgau in December 1527. However, Agricola did not change his ideas and later depicted Luther as disagreeing with him. After Agricola moved to Wittenberg, he maintained that the law must be used in the courthouse but it must not be used in the church. He said that repentance comes from hearing the good news only and does not precede but rather follows faith. He continued to disseminate this doctrine in books, despite receiving various warnings from Luther.

Luther, with reluctance, at last, believed that he had to make a public comment against antinomianism and its promoters in 1538 and 1539. Agricola apparently yielded, and Luther&#x27;s book &quot;Against the Antinomians&quot; (1539) was to serve as Agricola&#x27;s recantation. This was the first use of the term Antinomian. But the conflict flared up again, and Agricola sued Luther. He said that Luther had slandered him in his disputations, &quot;Against the Antinomians&quot;, and in his &quot;On the Councils and Churches&quot; (1539). But before the case could be brought to trial, Agricola left the city, even though he had bound himself to remain at Wittenberg, and moved to Berlin where he had been offered a position as preacher to the court. After his arrival there, he made peace with the Saxons, acknowledged his &quot;error&quot;, and gradually conformed his doctrine to that which he had before opposed and assailed. He still used such terms as gospel and repentance in a different manner from Luther&#x27;s.

====Second antinomian controversy====

The antinomian doctrine, however, was not eliminated from Lutheranism. Melanchthon and those who agreed with him, called Philippists, were checked by the Gnesio-Lutherans in the Second Antinomian Controversy during the Augsburg Interim. The Philippists ascribed to the Gospel alone the ability to work repentance, to the exclusion of the law. They blurred the distinction between Law and Gospel by considering the Gospel itself to be a moral law. They did not identify Christ&#x27;s fulfillment of the law with the commandments which humans are expected to follow.

As a result, the Book of Concord rejects antinomianism in the last confession of faith. The Formula of Concord rejects antinomianism in the fifth article, &quot;On the Law and the Gospel&quot; and in the sixth article, &quot;On the Third Use of the Law&quot;.

===Reformed views===
The &quot;Articles of the Church of England, Revised and altered by the Assembly of Divines, at Westminster, in the year 1643&quot; condemns antinomianism, teaching that &quot;no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral. By the moral law, we understand all the Ten Commandments taken to their full extent.&quot; The Westminster Confession, held by Presbyterian Churches, holds that the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments &quot;does forever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof&quot;. The Westminster Confession of Faith further states: &quot;Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and His righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification; yet it is not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but works by love.&quot;

However, a number of seventeenth-century English writers in the Reformed tradition held antinomian beliefs. None of these individuals argued that Christians would not obey the law. Instead, they believed that believers would spontaneously obey the law without external motivation. Antinomianism during this period is likely a reaction against Arminianism, as it emphasized free grace in salvation to the detriment of any participation on the part of the believer. John Eaton (&quot;fl.&quot; 1619) is often identified as the father of English antinomianism. Tobias Crisp (1600–1643), a Church of England priest who had been Arminian and was later accused of being an antinomian. He was a divisive figure for English Calvinists, with a serious controversy arising from the republication of his works in the 1690s. Also lesser known was John Saltmarsh (priest).

From the latter part of the 18th century, critics of Calvinists accused them of antinomianism. Such charges were frequently raised by Arminian Methodists, who subscribed to a synergistic soteriology that contrasted with Calvinism&#x27;s monergistic doctrine of justification. The controversy between Arminian and Calvinistic Methodists produced the notable Arminian critique of Calvinism: Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Five Checks to Antinomianism&quot; (1771–75).

===Methodist views===
John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist tradition, harshly criticized antinomianism, considering it the &quot;worst of all heresies&quot;. He taught that Christian believers are bound to follow the moral law and that they are to partake in the means of grace for their sanctification. Methodists teach the necessity of following the moral law as contained in the Ten Commandments, citing Jesus&#x27; teaching, &quot;If ye love me, keep my commandments&quot; (cf. John 14:15).

The Methodist Churches consider antinomianism to be a heresy.

===Quaker views===
Religious Society of Friends were charged with antinomianism due to their rejection of a graduate clergy and a clerical administrative structure, as well as their reliance on the Spirit (as revealed by the Inner Light of God within each person) rather than the Scriptures. They also rejected civil legal authorities and their laws (such as the paying of tithes to the State church and the swearing of oaths) when they were seen as inconsistent with the promptings of the Inner Light of God.

===Antinomian charges against other groups===
Other Protestant groups that have been accused of antinomianism include the Anabaptists and Mennonites. The Ranters of 17th century England were one of the most outright antinomian sects in the history of Christianity. New Covenant Theology has been accused of antinomianism for their belief that the Ten Commandments have been abrogated, but they point out that nine of these ten are renewed under the New Covenant&#x27;s Law of Christ. John Eaton, a leader in the antinomian underground during the 1630s, interpreted Revelation 12:1 with a quote recorded by Giles Firmin: &quot;I saw a Woman Clothed with the Sun&quot; [That is, the Church Clothed with the righteousness of Christ, to her Justification] &quot;and the Moon,&quot; [that is, Sanctification] &quot;under her Feet.&quot; Scholars have speculated that the &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;light&quot; may have been code-words used to surreptitiously reveal antinomian sympathies. Sects such as the Ranters and Christian Science were accused of teaching that sin was nonexistent while New England Theology was accused of teaching that sin was beneficial.

===Biblical law in Christianity===

The question of the obligation to follow the Mosaic Law was a point of contention in the Early Christian Church. Many early converts were Greek and thus had less interest in adherence to the Law of Moses than did the earliest Christians, who were primarily Jewish and already accustomed to the Law. Thus, as Christianity spread into new cultures, the early church was pressured by Judaizers and Pharisees to decide which laws were still required of Christians, and which were no longer required under the New Covenant. The New Testament, (especially the book of Acts) is interpreted by some as recording the church slowly abandoning the &quot;ritual laws&quot; of Judaism, such as circumcision, Sabbath and kosher law, while remaining in full agreement on adherence to the &quot;divine law&quot;, or Jewish laws on morality, such as the Ten Commandments. Thus, the early Christian church incorporated ideas sometimes seen as &quot;partially antinomian&quot; or parallel to Dual-covenant theology, while still upholding the traditional laws of moral behavior.
The apostles and elders met at Jerusalem, and after a spirited discussion, their conclusion, later called the &quot;Apostolic Decree&quot;, possibly a major act of differentiation of the Church from its Jewish roots (the first being the idea that Jesus was the messiah), was recorded in :

Beginning with Augustine of Hippo, many have seen a connection to Noahide Law, while some modern scholars reject the connection to &quot;Noahide Law&quot; and instead see Lev 17–18 as the basis.

James sets out a preliminary list of commands which Gentiles should obey. Gentiles were not required to be circumcised but were required to obey the four beginning requirements to be part of the larger congregation. This passage shows that the remainder of the commandments would follow as they studied &quot;Moses&quot; in the Synagogues. If Gentiles did not follow this reduced requirement, they risked being put out of the Synagogue and missing out on a Torah education (in and ). James&#x27;s list still includes some dietary commands, but many of those also passed out of some Christian traditions quite early. describes the following vision, which was used to excuse early gentile Christians from the Mosaic dietary laws.
Peter was perplexed about the vision in Acts 10. His subsequent explanation of the vision in Acts 11 gives no credence to antinomianism as it relates to the admission of Gentiles into covenant relationship with God.

Though the &quot;Apostolic Decree&quot; is no longer observed by many Christian denominations today, it is still observed in full by the Greek Orthodox. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church also preserves many Judaic customs.

In the Letter to the Hebrews (), it is written that under the Old Testament Law, priests had to be from the tribe of Levi, Aaron, and his sons:

It is pointed out that Jesus was from the tribe of Judah, and thus Jesus could not be a priest under the Old Testament Law, as Jesus is not a descendant of Aaron. It states that the Law had to change for Jesus to be the High Priest: &quot;For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.&quot; (Hebrews 7:12)

====Supporting Pauline passages====


The Apostle Paul, in his Letters, says that believers are saved by the unearned grace of God, not by good works, &quot;lest anyone should boast&quot;, and placed a priority on orthodoxy (right belief) before orthopraxy (right practice). The soteriology of Paul&#x27;s statements in this matter has long been a matter of dispute. In modern Protestant orthodoxy, this passage is interpreted as a reference to justification by trusting Christ.

Paul used the term &quot;freedom in Christ&quot;, for example, . Some understood this to mean &quot;lawlessness&quot; (i.e. not obeying Mosaic Law). For example, in , Paul is accused of &quot;persuading ... people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.&quot;

In James the Just explained his situation to Paul:
 is sometimes presented as proof of Paul&#x27;s antinomistic views. For example, the NIV translates these verses: &quot;... he forgave us all our sins, having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.&quot; But, the NRSV translates this same verse as: &quot;... he forgave us all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross.&quot; This latter translation makes it sound as though it is a &quot;record of trespasses&quot;, rather than &quot;the Law itself&quot;, that was &quot;nailed to the cross.&quot; The interpretation partly depends on the original Greek word which, according to Strong&#x27;s G5498, literally means &quot;something written by hand;&quot; it is variously translated as &quot;the bond&quot; (RSV, NAB), &quot;written code&quot; (NIV), or &quot;record&quot; (ESV, NRSV, CEB), as in a record of debt.

2 Corinthians 3:6–17 says,
&quot;Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious. Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ. But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.&quot; (KJV)

Some cite : &quot;And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.&quot; states twice that believers are not under the law: Romans 6:14 &quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.&quot; and Romans 6:15 &quot;What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.&quot;. KJV

 describes the Galatians as &quot;foolish&quot; for relying on being observant to the Law: &quot;(1) O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? (2) This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? (3) Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? (4) Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. (5) He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&quot; KJV

 says that the purpose of the Law was to lead people to Christ, once people believe in Christ, they are no longer under the Law:
&quot;(23) But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. (24) Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. (25) But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.&quot; KJV

In , Paul compares the Old Covenant with the New Covenant. In this comparison, he equates each covenant with a woman, using the wives of Abraham as examples. The old covenant is equated with the slave woman, Hagar, and the new covenant is equated with the free woman Sarah (). He concludes this example by saying that we are not children of the slave woman, but children of the free woman. In other words, we are not under the old covenant, we are under the new covenant.
&quot;(22) For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. (23) But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. (24) Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. (25) For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. (26) But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.&quot; KJV ()

 is sometimes translated: &quot;For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth&quot; (KJV), or &quot;Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes&quot; (NRSV). The key word here is &quot;telos&quot; (Strong&#x27;s G5056). Robert Badenas argues that &quot;telos&quot; is correctly translated as goal, not end, so that Christ is the &quot;goal&quot; of the Law. N. T. Wright in his &quot;New Testament for Everyone&quot; translates this verse as: &quot;The Messiah, you see, is the goal of the law, so that covenant membership may be available for all who believe.&quot; Andy Gaus&#x27; version of the New Testament translates this verse as: &quot;Christ is what the law aims at: for every believer to be on the right side of [God&#x27;s] justice.&quot;

Also cited is : &quot;He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace,&quot; NRSV. Another passage cited is , especially Romans 7:4 &quot;Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.&quot; and Romans 7:6 &quot;But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.&quot; KJV

The first covenant (made with Israel, as recorded in the Old Testament) is compared with the new covenant in . In Hebrews 8:6–7: &quot;But the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, and it is founded on better promises. For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.&quot; It goes on to say that the problem with the first covenant was with the people who were supposed to keep it and that in the new covenant: &quot;I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.&quot; 

The first covenant was said to be obsolete, and would soon disappear: &quot;By calling this covenant &quot;new,&quot; he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.&quot; . It identifies the first covenant which is disappearing in . Particularly the &quot;stone tablets of the covenant&quot; in Hebrews 9:4 referred directly to the Ten Commandments.
&quot;Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table, and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron&#x27;s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover.&quot; (Hebrews 9:1–5)

However, the notion that the Ten Commandments have been abrogated, as found in New Covenant Theology, is challenged by some.

Some scholars consider Jesus&#x27; Sermon on the Mount (particularly the Antitheses) to be an antitype of the proclamation of the Ten Commandments or Mosaic Covenant by Moses from the Biblical Mount Sinai.

====Opposing Pauline passages====
Those who oppose antinomianism invoke Paul as upholding obedience to the law:
* &quot;Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.&quot; KJV
* &quot;But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.&quot; KJV
* &quot;But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.&quot; KJV
* &quot;Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;&quot; KJV
* &quot;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.&quot; KJV
* &quot;For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.&quot; KJV
* &quot;For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. &quot; KJV
* &quot;Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.&quot; KJV
* &quot;Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.&quot; KJV
* &quot;Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry.&quot; KJV
* &quot;Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.&quot; KJV
* &quot;Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.&quot; KJV
* &quot;Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?&quot; KJV
* &quot;The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.&quot; KJV
* &quot;Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.&quot; KJV
* &quot;While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Cæsar, have I offended any thing at all.&quot; KJV

====Theology====
The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1910) article on &quot;Judaizers&quot; notes: &quot;Paul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the Mosaic Law, as long as it did not interfere with the liberty of the Gentiles, but he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required (). Thus he shortly after the Council of Jerusalem circumcised Timothy (), and he was in the very act of observing the Mosaic ritual when he was arrested at Jerusalem ( sqq.).&quot;

The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; article on &quot;Gentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah&quot; notes the following reconciliation: &quot;R. Emden, in a remarkable apology for Christianity contained in his appendix to &quot;Seder &#x27;Olam,&quot; gives it as his opinion that the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the Gentiles to the seven moral laws of Noah and to let the Jews follow the Mosaic law — this explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the laws of Moses and the Sabbath.&quot;

The Tübingen school of historians founded by F. C. Baur holds that in Early Christianity, there was a conflict between Pauline Christianity and the Jerusalem Church led by James the Just, Simon Peter, and John the Apostle, the so-called &quot;Jewish Christians&quot; or &quot;Pillars of the Church.&quot; In many places Paul writes that he was an observant Jew and that Christians should &quot;uphold the Law&quot; (). In , part of the Incident at Antioch, Paul publicly accused Peter of judaizing. Even so, he says sins remain sins and upholds by several examples the kind of behaviour that the church should not tolerate (e.g., , ). In he cites Jesus&#x27; teaching on divorce (&quot;not I but the Lord&quot;) and does not reject it, but goes on to proclaim his own teaching (&quot;I, not the Lord&quot;), an extended counsel regarding a specific situation which some interpret as conforming to what the Lord said. But, this may mean he received direct knowledge of what the Lord wanted him to teach through the Holy Ghost ().

====Paul versus James====

The Epistle of James, in contrast, states that we are to obey the Law of God and that &quot;a person is justified by works and not by faith alone&quot; (). Historically, this statement has been difficult for Protestants to reconcile with their belief in justification by faith alone as it appears to contradict Paul&#x27;s teaching that works don&#x27;t justify (Romans 4:1–8). Martin Luther, believing that his doctrines were refuted by James&#x27;s conclusion that works also justify, suggested that the Epistle might be a forgery, and relegated it to an appendix in his Bible. Literature which discusses this includes the article on &quot;James 2:20&quot; in &quot;Law and Gospel&quot;. , , and Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification.

James also wrote: &quot;For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said, &#x27;Do not commit adultery,&#x27; also said, &#x27;Do not murder.&#x27; If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.&quot; . One interpretation is that people who want to keep the Old Testament Law must perfectly keep all of the Law—&quot;an impossible task.&quot; James appeals to his readers to follow the &quot;Royal Law of Love&quot; instead of in the preceding verses (James 2:8–9). But the scholar Alister McGrath says that James was the leader of a Judaizing party that taught that Gentiles must obey the entire Mosaic Law.

Paul made a statement that appears to agree with James, saying that &quot;both&quot; faith produced as a result of repentance (the initial requirement for justification) &quot;and&quot; works (the evidence or proof of true faith) must exist together:
&quot;So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven. First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and &quot;prove their repentance by their deeds&quot;.&quot; Acts 26:19–20 (NIV)

====Jesus====

The Torah prescribes the death penalty for desecrating the Sabbath by working (). To avoid any &quot;possibility&quot; of breaking the simple and few original Torah commands, the Pharisees formulated and added several thousand strict laws and numerous traditions which they treated as laws. According to the Christians, Jesus criticized the Pharisees for adding to the law (). The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; article on Jesus notes:
&quot;Jesus, however, does not appear to have taken into account the fact that the Halakah was at this period just becoming crystallized, and that much variation existed as to its definite form; the disputes of Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai were occurring about the time of his maturity.&quot;

In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus&#x27; disciples were picking grain for food on the Sabbath (). This was against one of the Pharisaic laws that had been added to the original Torah law which prohibited work on the Sabbath day. When the Pharisees challenged Jesus over breaking their law, he pointed to Biblical precedent and declared that &quot;the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath&quot;. Some claim Jesus rejected complete adherence to the Torah. Most scholars hold that Jesus did not reject the law, but directed that it should be obeyed in context. E. P. Sanders notes, &quot;No substantial conflict existed between Jesus and the Pharisees with regard to Sabbath, food, and purity laws. ... The church took some while to come to the position that the Sabbath need not be kept, and it is hard to think that Jesus explicitly said so.&quot; There may be passages where the words of Jesus have been misinterpreted and were not really in contradiction with the Jewish law. Jesus never once broke the Torah, yet he did denounce the added Pharisaic rules and openly defied the Pharisees.

In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is sometimes said to refer to wicked people with the term &quot;ergazomenoi tēn anomian&quot; ()—e.g., , . Due to this negative context, the term has almost always been translated as &quot;evildoers&quot;, although it literally means &quot;workers of lawlessness&quot;. In Hebrew, lawlessness would imply &quot;Torahlessness&quot;. Matthew appears to present Jesus as equating wickedness with encouraging antinomianism. Scholars view Matthew as having been written by or for a Jewish audience, the so-called Jewish Christians. Several scholars argue that Matthew artificially lessened a claimed rejection of Jewish law so as not to alienate his intended audience. But, Jesus called for full adherence to the commandments () He declared: &quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.&quot; (). A parallel verse to is .

 states: &quot;Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.&quot;

==Islamic antinomianism==
In Islam, the law — which applies not only to religion, but also to areas such as politics, banking, and sexuality — is called &quot;sharīʿah&quot; (), and traditionally draws from four primary sources:
# the Quran, which is Islam&#x27;s central religious text;
# the Sunnah, which refers to actions practised during the time of the prophet Muḥammad, and is often thought to include the &quot;ḥadīth&quot;, or recorded words and deeds of Muḥammad;
# &quot;Ijmāʿ&quot;, which is the consensus of the &quot;ʿulamāʾ&quot;, or class of Islamic scholars, on points of practice;
# &quot;Qiyās&quot;, which—in Sunnī Islam—is a kind of analogical reasoning conducted by the ʿulamāʾ upon specific laws that have arisen through appeal to the first three sources; in Shia Islam, &quot;ʿaql&quot; (&quot;reason&quot;) is used in place of &quot;qiyās&quot;

Actions, behavior, or beliefs that are considered to violate any or all of these four sources — primarily in matters of religion — can be termed &quot;antinomian&quot;. Depending on the action, behavior, or belief in question, a number of different terms can be used to convey the sense of &quot;antinomian&quot;: &quot;shirk&quot; (&quot;association of another being with God&quot;); &quot;bidʻah&quot; (&quot;innovation&quot;); &quot;kufr&quot; (&quot;disbelief&quot;); &quot;ḥarām&quot; (&quot;forbidden&quot;); etc.

As an example, the 10th century Sufi mystic al-Hallaj was executed for &quot;shirk&quot; for, among other things, his statement &quot;ana al-Ḥaqq&quot; (), meaning &quot;I am the Truth&quot;. As &quot;al-Ḥaqq&quot; (&quot;the Truth&quot;) is one of the Names of God in Islam, this would imply he was saying: &quot;I am God.&quot; Expressions like these are known as &quot;šaṭḥiyyāt&quot;. Another individual who has often been termed antinomian is Ibn Arabi, a 12th and 13th-century scholar and mystic whose doctrine of &quot;waḥdat al-wujūd&quot; (&quot;unity of being&quot;) has sometimes been interpreted as being pantheistic, and thus &quot;shirk.&quot;

Apart from individuals, entire groups of Muslims have also been called antinomian. One of these groups is the Nizārī Ismāʿīlī Shīʿa, who have always had strong millenarian tendencies arising partly from persecution directed at them by Sunnīs. Influenced to a certain extent by Gnosticism, the Ismāʿīlīs developed a number of beliefs and practices—such as their belief in the &quot;imamatte&quot; and an esoteric exegesis of the Qurʾān—that orthodox Sunnī Muslims considered being &quot;shirk&quot; and, hence, to be seen as antinomian. Certain other groups that evolved out of Shīʿah belief, such as the Alawites and the Bektashi Order, have also been considered antinomian. The Bektashis, particularly, have practices that diverge from conventional Islamic practice, such as the consumption of alcoholic beverages, the non-wearing of the &quot;ḥijāb&quot; (&quot;veil&quot;) by women, and gathering in the &quot;cemevi&quot; in preference to the mosque.

==Nonreligious antinomianism==
George Orwell was a frequent user of &quot;antinomian&quot; in a secular (and always approving) sense. In his 1940 essay on Henry Miller, &quot;Inside the Whale&quot;, the word appears several times, including one in which he calls A. E. Housman a writer in &quot;a blasphemous, antinomian, &#x27;cynical&#x27; strain&quot;, meaning defiant of arbitrary societal rules.

The psychologist Nathan Adler defined the &quot;antinomian personality type&quot; as &quot;manifested by one whose frame of reference is threatened or has been disrupted. He suffers from a breakdown in the balance of his control and release mechanisms and from the permeability of his body boundaries.&quot;

In his study of late-20th-century western society the historian Eric Hobsbawm used the term in a sociological sense.

<doc id="226558" wikidata="Q667141" url="?curid=226558" title="Column (botany)">
<text>The column, or technically the gynostemium, is a reproductive structure that can be found in several plant families: Aristolochiaceae, Orchidaceae, and Stylidiaceae.

It is derived from the fusion of both male and female parts (stamens and pistil) into a single organ. The top part of the column is formed by the anther, which is covered by an anther cap. This means that the &quot;style&quot; and &quot;stigma&quot; of the pistil, with the filaments and one or more anthers, are all united.

== Orchidaceae ==

The stigma sits at the apex of the column in the front but is pointing downwards after resupination (the rotation by 180 degrees before unfolding of the flower).

This stigma has the form of a small bowl, the clinandrium, a viscous surface embedding the (generally) single anther. On top of it all is the anther cap. Sometimes there is a small extension or little beak to the median stigma lobe, called rostellum.

Column wings may project laterally from the stigma. The column foot is formed by the attachment of the lip to the basal protruding part of the column. One speaks of a mentum (chin) if the lateral sepals are also basally adnate (= attached to the foot of the column).

The column both releases pollen and also receives it (from another individual) for fertilization. In the family Orchidaceae, unlike almost all other flowering plants, the single male anther at the tip of the &quot;column&quot; produces pollen that is not free and powdery but held in waxy masses of two, four or six pellets called pollinia. The transfer of &quot;pollinia&quot; from one flower to another, though highly efficient, is often reliant upon one particular species of arthropods and it can be catastrophic for the population if its pollinator disappears from the community.

<doc id="226559" wikidata="Q3181686" url="?curid=226559" title="John Hamm">
<text>John Frederick Hamm (born April 8, 1938) is a Canadian physician and politician, who served as the 25th premier of Nova Scotia from 1999 to 2006.

==Education==
Hamm, a graduate of the University of King&#x27;s College and Dalhousie University, was a family doctor in his hometown of Stellarton, Nova Scotia, and the president of the Nova Scotia Medical Society.

==Provincial politics==
He entered politics in 1993, becoming the Member of the Legislative Assembly for the riding of Pictou Centre.

==Progressive Conservative Party==
Hamm was elected leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia in 1995, succeeding Terry Donahoe. His party won 14 seats in the 1998 provincial election and held the balance of power in a minority government where both the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party, led by Russell MacLellan and Robert Chisholm, respectively, held nineteen seats.

==Premier of Nova Scotia==
Hamm&#x27;s Tories defeated the Liberal minority government on a budget vote on June 17, 1999, and in the subsequent election on July 27, 1999, Hamm was elected Premier, winning 30 of the 52 seats in the provincial legislature.

After taking office, Hamm sold or closed government-owned industries such as Sydney Steel. He invested more in education and health care, and implemented some tax cuts. His government was the first to truly balance provincial finances in 25 years, following changes in public sector accounting practises.

In 2001, Hamm was at odds with the Nova Scotia Government Employees Union, trying to legislate nurses back to work after a legal strike.

In the 2003 election, Hamm&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives were reduced to a minority government. The main issue in that election was the increasing cost of car insurance and whether Nova Scotia should begin to allow general Sunday shopping. Despite the minority government, Hamm&#x27;s government was able to drop an NDP plan for government automobile insurance issue, and put the Sunday shopping issue to a province-wide plebiscite. Hamm is opposed to Sunday shopping and a public auto insurance system.

==Retirement==
On September 29, 2005, Hamm announced his intention to retire as Premier and PC Leader. In the 2006 Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia leadership election, Rodney MacDonald was elected his successor.

==After politics==
On December 21, 2006, Hamm was appointed Chairperson of Assisted Human Reproduction Canada, a federal agency created to protect and promote the health and safety, human dignity and human rights of Canadians who use or are born of assisted human reproduction technologies, and to foster ethical principles in relation to assisted human reproduction and other related matters.

In 2009, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions to the province of Nova Scotia as a former premier, family physician and community leader.&quot;

In 2010 he became the Chairman of the Board of the holding company for Northern Pulp mill of Abercrombie, whose board he had joined shortly after his resignation from politics prior to the 2006 provincial election.

In May 2014 he was awarded a Doctor of Civil Law (honoris causa) from University of King&#x27;s College, Halifax, Nova Scotia for his service to King&#x27;s, his community and the province.

October 2014, he was awarded an &quot;Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.&quot;

Also in October 2014, John Hamm was appointed the Honorary Colonel for the 1st Battalion Nova Scotia Highlanders (North) for the next three years.

==Atlantic Accord==
One of his most notable achievements was negotiating with the federal government to implement the Atlantic Accord, a multi-decade regional development program that had been approved in principle during the late 1980s to prevent provincial government offshore oil and gas royalties from being included in calculations for the federal equalization program. This resulted in an $830 million payment in 2005 from the federal government, which Hamm applied against the principal on the province&#x27;s long term debt, thereby reducing debt servicing payments by over $50 million annually.

<doc id="226562" wikidata="Q1092399" url="?curid=226562" title="Tin Cup">
<text>Tin Cup is a 1996 American romantic comedy and sports film co-written and directed by Ron Shelton, and starring Kevin Costner and Rene Russo with Cheech Marin and Don Johnson in major supporting roles. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and performed moderately at the box office, grossing $75.8 million against its $45 million budget. Costner received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

==Plot==
Roy &quot;Tin Cup&quot; McAvoy is a former golf prodigy who lost his chance to become a professional golfer when he attempted a risky shot for the final round of the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament rather than taking a safer shot. He owns a ramshackle driving range in West Texas, where he drinks and hangs out with his pal Romeo Posar and their friends.

One day Dr. Molly Griswold, a clinical psychologist, arrives looking for a golf lesson. She has been dating David Simms, a top professional golfer who played with Roy at the University of Houston. Roy is attracted to Molly.

The next day, Simms shows up at Roy&#x27;s trailer ahead of a local benefit tournament. Roy thinks he is being invited to play, but Simms actually wants to hire him as a caddie. During the round, Roy needles Simms about laying up instead of having the nerve to take a 230-yard shot over a water hazard. A bet among the other players is made, and Simms fires Roy after he makes the long shot.

To get even with Simms and prove his worth to Molly, Roy decides to try to qualify for the U.S. Open. He makes a play for Molly. She turns him down but offers to be his sports psychologist in exchange for golf lessons.

In the first qualifying round, with Romeo as his caddie, Roy&#x27;s game is excellent, but he insists on playing recklessly. They fight, and Romeo quits. Despite breaking most of his clubs in a tantrum, Roy advances to the final qualifying round. Without Romeo, he barely succeeds at the sectional qualifying round, earning a spot in the U.S. Open. Romeo returns and helps Roy with some swing problems.

On the first day of the U.S. Open, Roy, playing hungover, shoots a horrendous 83. Meanwhile, Molly sees Simms&#x27; unpleasant side and decides she wants to be with Roy. With renewed confidence, he shocks the golf world by making the cut with a round record at 10 under par. Roy&#x27;s third round is also excellent and moves him into contention.

On the last day of the tournament, Roy is in a three-way battle to win. For the fourth day in a row, he takes a shot that repeatedly fails to keep the ball out of the water hazard. On his twelfth and final shot, facing disqualification, he reaches the green and gets the ball into the hole. Roy has blown a shot at winning the U.S. Open, but Molly reassures him that people will always remember his amazing shot.

Back in Texas, Molly tells Roy that he automatically qualified for next year&#x27;s Open. They kiss passionately as the movie ends.

==Production==

&quot;Tin Cup&quot; was based on a story by Ron Shelton and Tim Norville inspired by the vulgar expression, &quot;He&#x27;s (She&#x27;s) not worth a fart in a tin cup.&quot; It was scripted by Norville and received a rewrite from Shelton. Costner joined the project in June 1995, having previously worked with Shelton on &quot;Bull Durham&quot;. Filming was due to start on September 15, 1995.

Janine Turner was reportedly the first choice for the role of Molly Griswold, but she turned it down. Michelle Pfeiffer was also approached before Rene Russo was then cast. Pierce Brosnan and Alec Baldwin were considered for the part of David Simms, before Don Johnson was placed in the film. John Leguizamo was offered the character of Romeo Posar until Cheech Marin stepped in to do the role.

Kevin Costner trained extensively with Gary McCord to learn how to play golf, as stated in the foreword Costner wrote for McCord&#x27;s book, &quot;Golf For Dummies&quot;. McCord helped Costner develop a swing and pre-shot routine, is listed in the end credits as a golf consultant and has a cameo appearance in the film.

The film&#x27;s climactic scenes take place at a fictional U.S. Open tournament set in North Carolina. Some of the film was shot in Kingwood, Texas, and some was shot at Tubac GC in Tubac, Arizona. The movie&#x27;s 18th hole is actually the 13th hole on Kingwood&#x27;s Deerwood course; the lake that guards the front of the green on this beautiful and difficult par-5, actually a par 4 in real life, was built by Ray Ramirez who played the course with friends while working for Friendswood Development Company in 1988. What is now a famous lake used to be an unsightly waste bunker distracting from the beautiful hole and course. He decided to implement the change not knowing almost a decade later it would play a role in one of the most iconic scenes in golf cinema history.

There are (credited) cameo appearances by pro golfers Phil Mickelson, Craig Stadler, John Cook, Johnny Miller, Lee Janzen, Billy Mayfair, Corey Pavin, Fred Couples and Peter Jacobsen—as well as TV golf broadcasters Jim Nantz, Ken Venturi, Gary McCord, Ben Wright, Frank Chirkinian, Lance Barrow, Peter Kostis, Jimmy Roberts, Brian Hammonds and George Michael—all playing themselves.

Many of the golf shots by Costner&#x27;s character Roy McAvoy were made by Costner himself.

The scene at the end of the movie in which Roy McAvoy repeatedly reaches the water hazard is based on a true incident. Gary McCord, an actual commentator and pro on the Champions Tour, needed a birdie to win. He kept reaching the hazard and it took him 15 strokes to reach the green, then just one putt, from 25 feet, to complete the par-4 hole. In the movie, McAvoy holes out the shot in 12.

The ball of Costner&#x27;s that knocked a pelican off its perch is also based upon a true incident involving McCord.

The film included product placement from Taylor Made. Don Johnson&#x27;s character David Simms uses a Taylor Made golf bag and clubs. Costner also used Taylor Made, but the prop department repainted and sanded the clubs to make them look suitably rough.

==Legacy==
An annual golf tournament located in Charlotte, NC that benefits the American Cancer Society is named the &quot;Tin Cup Tournament&quot;. It is the American Cancer Society&#x27;s largest single-day golf event in the Carolinas. Play is always on the second Monday of August. The 2004 REMAX World Long Drive Champion, David Mobley, is an annual celebrity guest. Most recently, the location is at Ballantyne Resort Golf Course. A yearly golf outing in Appleton, WI is called the Tin Cup Open and players are able to play with only a 7-iron club, inspired by McAvoy&#x27;s qualifying meltdown. The outing raises funds for the local Early Intervention Program of Outagamie and Winnebago Counties and is a yearly big draw.

In a 1998 tournament, members of the gallery watching John Daly started shouting “Tin Cup” as he hit ball after ball in the water on his way to scoring 18 on a par-5 hole.

After carding a quadruple bogey and a double bogey on the 17th and 18th holes of the 2013 Players Championship, &quot;Tin Cup&quot; became a nickname for professional golfer Sergio García.

Eddie Pepperell was disqualified from a tournament in 2019 after running out of balls in a moment that was compared to the movie.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The movie debuted at No. 1. In its opening weekend the film earned $10.1 million and went on to earn $54 million at the US box office, and a worldwide total of $75.8 million against a budget of $45 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 74% based on reviews from 53 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Breezy and predictable, &quot;Tin Cup&quot; is a likeable sports comedy that benefits greatly from Kevin Costner&#x27;s amiable lead performance.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on reviews from 19 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 and wrote: &quot;Well written. The dialogue is smart and fresh.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Amiable and constantly amusing rather than uproarious, this mangy tale of a ne&#x27;er-do-well&#x27;s fitful assault on personal and professional respectability benefits greatly from Kevin Costner&#x27;s ingratiatingly comic star turn, his most appealing work in years.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was released through Sony in 1996.

<text>Rene Marie Russo (born February 17, 1954) is an American actress and model. She began her career as a fashion model in the 1970s, appearing on magazine covers such as &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. She made her film debut in the 1989 comedy &quot;Major League&quot;, and rose to international prominence in a number of thrillers and action films throughout the 1990s, including &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; (1992), &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; (1993), &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995), &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995), &quot;Ransom&quot; (1996), &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1999).

After headlining the family comedy &quot;Yours, Mine &amp; Ours&quot; (2005), Russo took a five-year break from acting. She returned to the screen as Frigga, the mother of the titular hero, in the superhero film &quot;Thor&quot; (2011), a role she reprised in &quot;&quot; (2013) and &quot;&quot; (2019). In 2014, Russo starred in the acclaimed crime thriller &quot;Nightcrawler&quot;, for which she won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She has also appeared in &quot;The Intern&quot; (2015), &quot;Just Getting Started&quot; (2017), and &quot;Velvet Buzzsaw&quot; (2019).

== Early life and education ==
Russo was born in 1954 in Burbank, California, to Shirley (née Balocca), a factory worker and barmaid, and Nino Russo, a sculptor and car mechanic who left the family when Russo was two. Russo has Italian ancestry. Russo grew up with her mother and her sister, Toni (who was married to lyricist Bernie Taupin between 1979 and 1991), and attended Burroughs High School, where her classmates included director Ron Howard. She was afflicted with scoliosis and had to wear a full-torso brace. Her height also earned her the nickname &quot;Jolly Green Giant&quot; from her classmates. In a 2019 interview with &quot;Financial Times&quot;, she indeed described herself as a &quot;geek&quot;, and admitted that the bullying she endured during high school made her drop out in the tenth grade. Growing up, Russo did not have any &quot;ambitions&quot;, remarking that she &quot;was too busy just trying to survive, along with my sister and my mom —money was tight, my mom worked two jobs&quot;. She began taking a variety of part-time jobs to help her family, including working in an eyeglass factory and as a movie theater cashier. She eventually got scouted for modelling and went to New York City, which she described as a &quot;scary place compared to where I grew up&quot;.

== Modeling ==
After allegedly being spotted at a 1972 Rolling Stones concert by John Crosby, an agent from International Creative Management, Russo originally began her career as a model. With Crosby&#x27;s encouragement, Russo applied to, and was signed by, Ford Modeling Agency. She became one of the top models of the 1970s and early 1980s, appearing on magazine covers for &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, as well as advertisements for perfume and cosmetics. &quot;Vogue&quot; in a 2016 article, wrote: &quot;In the &#x27;70s, Russo stood for a sexiness that was both accessible and aspirational: She could vamp it up with the best of them, posing for Francesco Scavullo in decadent furs, or swathed in Versace for Richard Avedon, but Russo wasn&#x27;t your average pinup. The poise she brought to her images made her the first choice for editorial shoots that demanded models with tenacity, whether she was bound for the boardroom in a power suit or posing on a beach with Tony Spinelli&quot;.

== Acting ==
=== 1980s ===
Modeling assignments began to wane for Russo as she entered her 30s. She did a few more commercials and then turned her back on modeling for a period of time. She studied theater and acting, and began appearing in theater roles at small theaters in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California. At one point, she took acting lessons from veteran actor Allan Rich, whom she credits with introducing her to the craft of acting. Russo made her debut in a television series in 1987, with a supporting role in the short-lived ABC production &quot;Sable,&quot; based on the comic book, &quot;Jon Sable: Freelance&quot; by Mike Grell. She made her feature film debut as the girlfriend of a former baseball star in &quot;Major League&quot;, a comedy written and directed by David S. Ward. The film was a critical success.

===1990s===
In 1990, Russo appeared in the fantasy comedy film &quot;Mr. Destiny&quot;, with Jim Belushi, playing the wife in what was an alternate reality of an ordinary guy&#x27;s life. In 1991, she had her first leading film role in &quot;One Good Cop&quot;, as the wife of a New York City Police Department detective (played by Michael Keaton). In 1992, Russo achieved breakout success with her role as internal affairs detective Lorna Cole, opposite Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, in the action film &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;. The film made US$320 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 1992 and the highest-grossing film in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film series. Her other 1992 film release was the science fiction film &quot;Freejack&quot;, which despite an overall negative response, earned Russo a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Throughout the 1990s, Russo took on major roles in a number of commercially and critically successful films. In 1993, she starred with Clint Eastwood in the thriller film &quot;In the Line of Fire,&quot; directed by Wolfgang Petersen, playing a federal agent involved with the sole active-duty Secret Service agent remaining from the detail guarding John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, at the time of his assassination in 1963. The film made US$176.9 million globally, and received three Academy Awards nominations. In 1995, Petersen cast her as a medical doctor, who uncovers a newly discovered Ebola-like virus which came to the United States from Africa in an infected monkey, in the medical disaster film &quot;Outbreak&quot;, with Dustin Hoffman. The film grossed over US$189 million worldwide. She starred as a B movie actress, opposite John Travolta, in the crime comedy &quot;Get Shorty,&quot; directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Upon its release, &quot;Get Shorty&quot; opened atop at the North American box office and remained number one for three consecutive weeks.

In 1996, Russo played a clinical psychologist and the love interest of a former golf prodigy with little ambition in the romantic comedy &quot;Tin Cup&quot;, with Kevin Costner, and reunited with Mel Gibson to play his wife in the crime thriller &quot;Ransom,&quot; directed by Ron Howard. While &quot;Tin Cup&quot; was a moderate commercial success, &quot;Ransom&quot; was the 6th highest-grossing film of 1996, with a worldwide gross of US$309.5 million. In 1997, Russo portrayed exotic animal owner Gertrude Lintz in the little-seen comedy &quot;Buddy&quot;, and in 1998, reprised her role in &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;, the final film in the series, which made US$285.4 million. In 1999, she starred as an insurance investigator and the lover of a billionaire, alongside Pierce Brosnan, in the heist film &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; directed by John McTiernan. Critic Kenneth Turan, in his review for the film, wrote: &quot;[Her] smart, gritty performance is the best thing about this remake of the stylish caper movie &quot;Thomas Crown&quot;.&quot; The production grossed US$124.3 million worldwide.

===2000s===
In 2000, Russo obtained the role of villain Natasha Fatale, opposite Robert De Niro and Piper Perabo, in the adventure comedy &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, directed by Des McAnuff and based on the television cartoon of the same name by Jay Ward. The film received mixed reviews from critics and went largely unnoticed at the box office. For her portrayal, she received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and conversely, a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actress. She reunited with De Niro to play the producer of a reality police show in the comedy &quot;Showtime&quot; (2002), also starring Eddie Murphy. Budgeted at US$85 million, the film grossed US$77.7 million.

The comedy &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, which was based on the novel by Dave Barry and featured her as a devoted mother, was originally scheduled for release on September 21, 2001, and had a strong advertising push. The events of September 11 of that year cast a pall over the movie&#x27;s comedic smuggling of a nuclear device onto an airplane. Consequently, the film was pushed back until 2002, and the promotion campaign was toned down almost to the point of abandonment. The film came to theaters and left quickly afterwards, without generating much of an impact.

Russo starred in and produced the film &quot;Two for the Money&quot; (2005), with Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey, playing the wife of a sports gambling agent. In &quot;Yours, Mine &amp; Ours&quot; (also 2005), Russo starred with Dennis Quaid, as a widowed handbag designer with ten kids. &quot;Film Journal International&quot; felt that the &quot;secret to the film&#x27;s modest success can be summed up&quot; in Russo and Quaid&#x27;s performances, and &quot;Daily Radar&quot; wrote that &quot;the able-bodied actors fulfill the slapstick demands of this run-of-the-mill family comedy&quot;. Despite receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, the film made over US$72 million worldwide and marked her only commercial success in the decade. Following its release, Russo took a five-year hiatus from acting, opting to focus on her health and personal life.

===2010s===

In 2010, Russo returned to the screen in the superhero film &quot;Thor&quot;, released in 2011, after being persuaded by director Kenneth Branagh in December 2009, who asked her to portray Frigga, the mother of the titular hero. However, most of her scenes were removed in editing. She received more screen time in &quot;&quot; (2013). She credited those films, which made more than US$1 billion combined, with introducing her to a new generation of filmgoers. &quot;The funny thing is now I have kids coming up to me, and I&#x27;m thinking, &#x27;how do you know my movies?&#x27; And they say, &#x27;That&#x27;s &quot;Thor&quot;&#x27;s mummy&#x27;.&quot;

In 2014, Russo appeared as a morning news director, alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, in the crime thriller &quot;Nightcrawler&quot;, written and directed by her husband Dan Gilroy. The film was met with widespread praise and several critics listed it as one of the best films of 2014. &quot;Indiewire&quot; asserted: &quot;Russo is an integral part of the narrative and she gives as good as she gets. The role is easily her finest in several years and the rich material uncorks a wealth of inventiveness from the actress. There&#x27;s not a lot of imaginatively drawn roles for aging women, but Russo sinks her teeth into the role of a coldblooded vampiress protective of her own uncertain hold in the newsroom.&quot; Budgeted at US$8.5 million, the film grossed US$50.3 million.

Russo portrayed a groupie and the mother of director G.J. Echternkamp in his independent comedy &quot;Frank and Cindy&quot; (2015), based on the 2007 documentary of the same name. In 2015, she reunited once again with Robert De Niro, playing an in-house massage therapist and his love interest, in the comedy &quot;The Intern&quot;, directed by Nancy Meyers. Both &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;New York Post&quot; found her to be a highlight in her role, and the film grossed US$194.6 million globally. Russo starred with Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones in another comedy, &quot;Just Getting Started&quot; (2017), as the regional director of the luxury resort Villa Capri in Palm Springs, California. &quot;Variety&quot; felt that the three actors &quot;do little more than embarrass themselves here&quot;, as part of an overall negative response.

In &quot;Velvet Buzzsaw&quot; (2019), Russo worked again with Jake Gyllenhaal and Dan Gilroy, playing a tough art gallery owner haunted by the mysterious nature of a series of paintings by an unknown artist. The film was released by Netflix, to positive reviews. She briefly reprised her role of Frigga in &quot;&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Russo married screenwriter Dan Gilroy on March 14, 1992. They met while working on the film &quot;Freejack&quot; (1992). They have one daughter, Rose, who has ventured into modelling, and live in Brentwood, Los Angeles.

Russo revealed during a 2014 taping of &quot;The Queen Latifah Show&quot; that she has bipolar disorder. While the condition has plagued her since childhood, an emotionally turbulent time prompted her to start taking medication, despite initial apprehension.

<doc id="226573" wikidata="Q485825" url="?curid=226573" title="Simple Plan">
<text>Simple Plan is a Canadian rock band formed in Montreal, Quebec, in 1999. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of Pierre Bouvier (lead vocals, studio bass guitar), Chuck Comeau (drums), Jeff Stinco (lead guitar), and Sébastien Lefebvre (rhythm guitar, backing vocals). David Desrosiers (bass guitar, backing vocals) joined the band in early 2000 and left in July 2020.

The band has released six studio albums: &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; (2002), &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; (2004), &quot;Simple Plan&quot; (2008), &quot;Get Your Heart On!&quot; (2011), &quot;Taking One for the Team&quot; (2016), and &quot;Harder Than It Looks&quot; (2022). The band has also released an EP titled &quot;Get Your Heart On – The Second Coming!&quot; (2013), in addition to two live albums: &quot;Live in Japan 2002&quot; (2003) and &quot;MTV Hard Rock Live&quot; (2005).

The band performed at the Vans Warped Tour every year from 1999 to 2005, and in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018. The band also performed at the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony in Vancouver, along with &quot;The X Factor Australia&quot;. In December 2012, the band performed at Mood Indigo, the college festival of IIT Bombay in Mumbai, India. In 2004, the band appeared as themselves in the film &quot;New York Minute&quot;, starring the Olsen twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley. Simple Plan also performed &quot;O Canada&quot; at the 2016 NHL Winter Classic. Additionally, they performed the theme music for, and were featured on an episode of, &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot;.

==History==

===1999–2001: early years===
In 1993, lead vocalist Pierre Bouvier and drummer Chuck Comeau were in a band named Reset. In 1998, Comeau left the group to go to college. In mid 1999, he met with high school friends and guitarists Jeff Stinco and Sébastien Lefebvre who were in separate bands of their own. Comeau, Stinco, and Lefebvre formed a new band together, called Simple Plan. In late 1999, Bouvier and Comeau reacquainted at a Sugar Ray concert and Bouvier left Reset soon after to join Comeau in the band. Bassist and backing vocalist David Desrosiers replaced Bouvier in Reset, but he too left the band six months later to join Simple Plan. This allowed Bouvier, who had doubled as the band&#x27;s lead vocalist and bassist, to concentrate on singing, and Stinco, who had doubled as the band&#x27;s lead guitarist and backing vocalist, to concentrate on guitar. In 2001 the band performed at Edgefest II in Toronto.

Originally, the band did not have the name. At first, they considered naming the band Touchdown 999; later Bouvier&#x27;s friends chose the name Simple Plan, derived from the 1998 film of the same name.

=== 2002–2006: &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; and &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; ===

In 2002, Simple Plan released their debut studio album, &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot;, which featured the singles &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Kid&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;, &quot;Addicted&quot;, and &quot;Perfect&quot;. The band was aiming for a pure pop-punk record. The record was originally released in the United States with 12 tracks, ending with &quot;Perfect&quot;. Enhanced and foreign editions came in several different versions with up to two additional tracks in addition to the original 12. Two pop punk singers contributed on vocals: Mark Hoppus from Blink-182 on &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; and included vocals by Joel Madden from Good Charlotte on &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mean Anything.&quot; The years of 2002 and 2003 were formative for the band. MTV Networks featured &quot;Addicted&quot; on one of their top performing shows during the spring of 2003 in the United States and internationally; on MTV and MTVu, and was filmed at the University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo) in Western New York. &quot;Addicted&quot; was the theme song for &quot;Fraternity Life&quot;. While the show was taken off the air the following season the band continued to rise on the billboard charts in the United States and performances continued to be booked and reruns of the show played around the world.

In 2002, the band also performed and recorded the theme song for a rebooted installment of the Scooby-Doo franchise, &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot;. This show used the band&#x27;s intro throughout its entire run until its conclusion in 2006. It also featured many of the band&#x27;s songs within episodes of the show, including &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;.

In 2003, the band played as a headliner on the Vans Warped Tour — an appearance memorialized in the comedy slasher film, &quot;Punk Rock Holocaust&quot;, in which four of the five band members are killed. The band also played short stints on the Warped Tour in 2004 and 2005. That same year (2003) the band opened for Avril Lavigne on her &quot;Try To Shut Me Up&quot; Tour. In addition to several headlining tours, the band has also opened for Green Day and Good Charlotte. The album had sold one million copies in early 2003 then went on to sell over four million copies worldwide, making it the band&#x27;s best selling album to date.

In 2004, Simple Plan released its second album, &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; which was produced by Bob Rock and led to the subsequent singles, &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot;, &quot;Shut Up&quot;, &quot;Untitled (How Could This Happen to Me?)&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, and (in some markets) &quot;Perfect World&quot;.

According to the album&#x27;s bonus DVD, the band originally considered other names for it like &quot;Get Rich or Die Trying&quot;, &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, and &quot;In The Zone&quot; before deciding on &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot;. The name stemmed from the band&#x27;s belief that they were not getting any good reviews, with Bouvier once noting that the band only had one recent good review in &quot;Alternative Press&quot;. &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; was a musical departure from the group&#x27;s previous album: the band retained its style of downbeat lyrics matched to upbeat music, but managed to transcend from the standard pop punk genre. Although many of the tracks on this CD still carried the feeling of teen angst that is probably most noticeable in &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Kid&quot; from &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot;, the general slant of this album tends toward slightly deeper and more mature lyrical themes, as well as a more mainstream sound that edges away from the pure pop punk style of the group&#x27;s last album. Some critics have pointed towards the inclusion of &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;mainstream&quot; rock elements, claiming the album &quot;de-emphasizes punk-pop hyperactivity in favor of straightforward, well-crafted modern rock&quot;.

In 2005, their cover version of Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;Surrender&quot; was featured in the soundtrack album for the superhero film, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

===2006–2009: &quot;Simple Plan&quot;===

After nearly a year and a half in support of &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot;, the band ended most touring in February 2006. They were playing only a few shows, taking some time off, and beginning work on the third studio album. Bouvier headed to Miami as on about 21 March 2007 to work with Dave Fortman. The band entered the studio for pre-production in Los Angeles on 29 June. On 15 July the band returned to Montréal to record at Studio Piccolo, the same studio in which the band had recorded &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot;. The band finished recording and headed back to Miami and Los Angeles to mix the album. The final part of making the record was done in New York City, and it was officially completed on 21 October.

&quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, the first single from &quot;Simple Plan&quot;, was released on 29 October. This album was produced by both Dave Fortman and Max Martin. On 17 February 2008, the band achieved its highest-charting single in the U.K. After the first two albums just missed the UK top 40, &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; gave the band its best chart position in the UK, coming in at number 26.

Simple Plan held an extensive tour schedule in support of the album. After completing an around-the-world promotional tour, they played several holiday shows during December 2007. After they continued promotional tours in January, Simple Plan played a triple bill in Camden Town, London on 27 January 2008, with the first show featuring songs from the band&#x27;s first CD, the second from the second, and the third from the new release. The band played four U.S. shows in late February, and completed a European tour running until late April. The band played four Japan dates, followed by several European festivals and headlining dates. On 1 July 2008, the band gave a free concert on Québec City&#x27;s Plains of Abraham, attracting a crowd of 150,000 people to the Canada Day show. After a return to the Far East in late July and early August, the band played a Cross Canada Tour with Faber Drive, Cute is What We Aim For and Metro Station. After dates in Germany, Mexico, and Australia, the band played its second full European tour of the year from 28 October to 29 November, playing in Estonia and Poland for the first time. The band also played in Tel Aviv and Dubai in early December—shows at which the band played as a four-piece, with Desrosiers absent due to a family emergency and Lefebvre on bass.

===2010–2013: &quot;Get Your Heart On!&quot;===
The band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Get Your Heart On!&quot; was released on 21 June 2011. The album marks Simple Plan&#x27;s second time since &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; to feature collaborations with other artists, including Weezer&#x27;s Rivers Cuomo, Marie-Mai, Natasha Bedingfield, K&#x27;naan and Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low. In April, &quot;Jet Lag&quot; was released in English and French versions featuring singers Natasha Bedingfield and Marie-Mai respectively. The band was on the roster of Warped Tour 2011 for selected dates in June and July 2011.

In September and October 2011, Simple Plan performed four shows in Australia, on the &quot;Get Your Heart On&quot; tour, with supporting bands Tonight Alive and New Empire. During the Australian tour, Jenna McDougall from Tonight Alive featured in &quot;Jet Lag&quot;. We the Kings supported Simple Plan in Europe on a tour in spring 2012. The song &quot;Last One Standing&quot; was featured on the &quot;NASCAR The Game: Inside Line&quot; soundtrack. Simple Plan also performed live with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra at Montreal Symphony House in Montréal, Quebec, Canada on 20 September 2011, raising over $500,000 for sick children and young people in need.

An EP titled &quot;Get Your Heart On – The Second Coming!&quot; was released on 3 December. Consequently, Simple Plan uploaded the DVD, directed by Peter John from Epik Films and shot by Peter John for the official Simple Plan YouTube channel, in high quality for free as a gift to the fans.

In March 2014, when the band members started recording the first demos for the album, it was announced through My Chemical Romance rhythm guitarist Frank Iero&#x27;s Instagram that Iero is working with Simple Plan on the next album. This information was later confirmed by Comeau; the band estimated to release the album in the second half of 2015, plus the band discussed the band&#x27;s future projects. On 30 July 2014, the band formally stated that the music writing for the next album had begun. In December 2014, Simple Plan started to choose which songs would be included on the album. &quot;Saturday&quot;, was released on 21 June 2015, although the band stated this song would not be in the album.

On 28 August 2015, the band released &quot;Boom&quot;, a song from the upcoming fifth album. On the same day, a music video was released for the song, which contains footage from the 2015 Vans Warped Tour, The Alternative Press Music Awards, and a performance in Montreal at New City Gas; the video contains cameos from members of the bands MxPx, All Time Low, New Found Glory, PVRIS, Pierce the Veil, The Summer Set, Silverstein, Black Veil Brides, Parkway Drive and Issues.

On 18 September 2015, the band released a second song from the fifth studio album, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be Sad,&quot; and a third called &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go to Bed,&quot; featuring rapper Nelly on 16 October 2015. On 30 November 2015, the band revealed the title of the album would be &quot;Taking One for the Team&quot;. The group set the release date for 19 February 2016, along with the album cover and the first tour dates of the Taking One for the Team Tour, with shows scheduled in European countries.

In 2016, the band performed at the NHL Winter Classic at Gillette Stadium against the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins. They performed &quot;O Canada&quot; during the pregame and also performed during the second intermission.

Simple Plan released their third single &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; internationally on 12 April. The album was released on 19 February 2016. It was described as a &quot;pure, no-frills, feel-good fun, a start-to-finish crowd-pleaser for fans of that classic pop-punk sound.&quot; On 5 December, Simple Plan released &quot;Christmas Everyday&quot;, 15 years after their last Christmas song and first single, &quot;My Christmas List&quot;.

===2017–present: David Desrosiers&#x27; departure and &quot;Harder Than It Looks&quot;===
In 2017, the band embarked on a tour called No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls (15th Anniversary Tour Edition) in support of the album in question&#x27;s anniversary, during which they played the entire album front to back during each show. From May 2017 until June 2019, David Desrosiers had been on hiatus from touring with Simple Plan, while he was at home recovering from depression. During that time, a touring musician named Chady Awad had been performing bass with the band as a touring substitute for more than two years, while Bouvier and Lefebvre had divided Desrosiers&#x27; vocal parts. This marks the second time Desrosiers has been absent from the band; the first time was in December 2008, when Lefebvre temporarily switched to bass for 2 weeks during live performances.

In September 2017, while interviewed by Purdue University, Jeff Stinco revealed that the band would start working on their new album in early 2018.

On 5 September 2018, Music in Minnesota reported that members of Simple Plan spent a day in Owatonna, Minnesota, to appear in scenes of a punk rock musical titled &quot;Summertime Dropouts&quot;.

==Musical style==
Simple Plan&#x27;s musical style has been described as pop-punk, alternative rock, pop rock, power pop, emo, and punk rock. Atlantic Records marketing material has described the band&#x27;s style as having &quot;classic punk energy and modern pop sonics&quot;.

==Simple Plan Foundation==
The members of Simple Plan created the Simple Plan Foundation, which focuses on teen problems ranging from suicide to poverty to drug addiction. As of 9 December 2005, the Simple Plan Foundation had raised more than $100,000.

A fundraising event was held in September 2009 in Montréal. In October 2008, the band announced a special release on iTunes of the single &quot;Save You&quot;, to benefit the Foundation, with a special composite video featuring cancer survivors. The song was inspired by the struggle with cancer of Bouvier&#x27;s brother Jay.

On 15 March 2011, the Foundation stated it would donate $10,000 in aid after the 2011 earthquake that hit Japan.

In 2012, to mark the band&#x27;s 10th anniversary, the book &quot;Simple Plan: The Official Story&quot; was released, which was used as a fundraiser for the Simple Plan Foundation.

In March 2024, the foundation donated US$10,000 to help support residents of Rio Grande do Sul after a flood. They also sold a Brazil specific merch T-shirt, from which the proceeds will go towards the flood victims.
