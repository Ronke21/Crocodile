<text>Devonport ( ) is a harbourside suburb of Auckland, New Zealand. It is located on the North Shore, at the southern end of the Devonport Peninsula that runs southeast from near Lake Pupuke in Takapuna, forming the northern side of the Waitematā Harbour. East of Devonport lies North Head, the northern promontory guarding the mouth of the harbour.

The suburb hosts the Devonport Naval Base of the Royal New Zealand Navy, the main facility for the country&#x27;s naval vessels, but is also known for its harbourside dining and drinking establishments and its heritage charm. Devonport has been compared to Sausalito, California, US due to its setting and scenery.

== Etymology ==
Devonport is named after the English naval town of Devonport.

Eastern Devonport is known as Cheltenham, named after the English town of Cheltenham.

== Geography ==
Devonport is a peninsula at the mouth of the Waitematā Harbour on the North Shore of Auckland. It is surrounded by Ngataringa Bay to the northwest, the Waitematā Harbour mouth to the south, and the Rangitoto Channel of the Hauraki Gulf to the east.

The suburb of Stanley Point can be found to the west of Devonport, while the suburbs of Narrow Neck and Vauxhall are found to the north. The northwestern section of Devonport is located at Duders Point, a peninsula within Ngataringa Bay.

The suburb has three beaches: Devonport Beach and Duders Beach to the south, and Cheltenham Beach to the northeast.

Devonport is home to three volcanoes of the Auckland volcanic field: Takarunga / Mount Victoria, Maungauika / North Head and Takararo / Mount Cambria. Of these three volcanoes, Maungauika / North Head is the oldest, estimated to have last erupted around 87,500 years ago. Takaroro / Mount Cambria and Takarunga / Mount Victoria are estimated to have last erupted 42,300 and 34,800 years ago respectively. Takarunga / Mount Victoria is the taller of the volcanoes, reaching a height of , with Maungauika / North Head reaching a height of . Takararo / Mount Cambria formerly stood at a height of , but was quarried in the 1870s. Another scoria cone, the high Duders Hill, believed to be a section of Takarunga / Mount Victoria, was quarried in the early 20th century.

== History ==

Around 40,000 years ago Devonport consisted of three islands of volcanic origin, Mount Victoria, North Head and between them Mount Cambria (now largely quarried away).

The earliest evidence for Māori settlement dates from the mid-14th century (roughly the same time as the believed landing of the &quot;Tainui&quot; migration canoe, which is commemorated by a stone memorial on the foreshore). A significant Māori settlement on North Head was ended by attacks from rival tribes in the 1790s. About 50 Māori were still living in Torpedo Bay, with their meeting house just east of Cambridge Terrace, until they fled to the Waikato when the colonial government launched war on Waikato Māori in 1863.

Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville, a French explorer, is thought to have gone ashore in the area in 1827, possibly as the first European. The first European building on the foreshore was a gunpowder magazine built in 1840.

Devonport is one of the oldest colonial settlements in Auckland, and the first on the North Shore. The Royal Navy survivors of HMS &quot;Buffalo&quot; settled at Devonport. In 1841 a signal station for Auckland&#x27;s shipping was erected on Mount Victoria (Takarunga), and the signal master, Robert Snow, and his family became the first Europeans to live in the area permanently. From then until the 1860s, the settlement was called Flagstaff, because of the flagstaff at the signal station. Flagstaff was subdivided for town sections and farms in the early 1850s.

For the first half century or so of its existence Devonport was geographically isolated from the rest of the North Shore, and was sometimes called &quot;the island&quot; by the local inhabitants. Only a thin strip of land beside the beach at Narrow Neck connected Devonport to Belmont and the rest of the North Shore peninsula. In the late 19th century the mangrove swamp that stretched from Narrow Neck to Ngataringa Bay was filled in to form a racecourse, now a golf course. A new road was built along the western edge of the racecourse allowing more direct travel to the north.

On the southern shore, to the west of the centre of Devonport, a nearby deep water anchorage suitable for Royal Navy vessels, the Devonport Naval Base was established in 1841. William Hobson, then the Governor of New Zealand, considered the sandspit-protected area a better choice for a naval installation than the shallower waters on the southern side of the Waitematā Harbour. While some facilities have expanded and shifted in location over time, the area is still the primary base for the Royal New Zealand Navy. The Calliope Dock at Stanley Bay, part of the base, was opened on 16 February 1888 and at the time was the largest dock in the Southern hemisphere. The suburb also had one of the oldest New Zealand shipyards, now part of the Devonport Yacht Club area.

The main centre of the suburb slowly shifted west from Church Street and the original wharf at Torpedo Bay, to its current location around the ferry wharf. The settlement itself was renamed Devonport by 1859 after the English naval town of Devonport. Devonport achieved Borough status in 1886 and was incorporated into North Shore City in 1989.

Devonport played a special role in the nuclear free movement. In 1981 the Devonport Borough Council voted to declare Devonport a nuclear-free zone, the first local council in New Zealand to do so.

In July 2007, Devonport was given permission to be excluded from a list of local Auckland growth node centres. The Auckland Regional Council accepted that while it was encouraging intensified growth (such as higher-density housing) around transport nodes such as Devonport, the character and historical nature of the Devonport Wharf area would make such a designation inappropriate in this case.

=== Ferries ===

The first ferry services to Auckland city began in the 1840s. These were open sailing cutters operated by local seamen running passengers to the foot of Queen Street, Auckland&#x27;s main road. In 1860 the first paddlesteamer ferries began operation. These were in turn replaced by double-ended, screw-driven ferries in 1904. Both passenger and vehicle ferries operated on the Devonport run until the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959. Immediately after the opening of the bridge, passenger ferry services to other North Shore destinations (such as Northcote and Birkenhead) were cancelled, as were all vehicular ferries. The Devonport passenger ferry was retained on a much reduced timetable. The majority of the ferries were scrapped, only a handful being retained until being replaced by more modern vessels. The last of the old-style double-ended ferries, the diesel-engined &quot;Kestrel&quot; (built in 1905), was retired from the commuter run in 1988 and was then operated for cruises and sightseeing.

In 2002 the &quot;Kestrel&quot; was moved to Tauranga to serve as a floating restaurant. The &quot;Kestrel&quot; changed hands again in 2010 and moved back to Auckland. On 8 March 2016 the &quot;Kestrel&quot; broke up and sank while tethered in its Wynyard Quarter berth. She was refloated, but her future remains uncertain.

== Character ==
Devonport maintains many old villas some of which date back to the 19th century.

The navy base at Devonport features strongly in the local character, with the North Shore City Council having signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Navy which recognises the developing partnership between them. The Torpedo Bay Navy Museum is also located in Devonport.

== Local government ==

From 1876 until 1886, Devonport was a part of the Takapuna Riding administered by the Waitemata County, a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. In 1886, the area split from the council, forming the Devonport Borough Council. In 1989, the borough was merged into the North Shore City, and in 2010 incorporated into the single unitary council, run by Auckland Council.

Within the Auckland Council, Devonport is a part of the Devonport-Takapuna local government area governed by the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board. It is a part of the North Shore ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council.

<text>Only When I Laugh is a 1981 American comedy-drama film based on Neil Simon&#x27;s 1970 play &quot;The Gingerbread Lady&quot;.

The story is about an alcoholic Broadway actress who reenters society after a long stay in a rehab clinic. As she tries to stay sober there are the triple responsibilities of raising her estranged teenaged daughter, getting a new acting role and maintaining her co-dependent relations with two close friends; one a wealthy, vain woman who fears the loss of her looks and a gay actor relegated to small roles in third-rate shows.

Simon changed the main character&#x27;s name to Georgia Hines for the film adaptation; the character was named Evy Meara in the stage version. The main character went from being a cabaret singer to a Broadway stage actress.

The film, written by Simon and directed by Glenn Jordan, stars Marsha Mason, Joan Hackett, James Coco, and Kristy McNichol. It also features two short scenes with then-unknowns Kevin Bacon and John Vargas. Simon&#x27;s next release, &quot;I Ought to Be in Pictures&quot;, was released just six months later, and its plot was similar.

It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Marsha Mason), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (James Coco), and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Joan Hackett). &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot; proved to be very successful at the box office.

Coco was also nominated for Worst Supporting Actor in Golden Raspberry Awards for the same role.

==Plot==
Actress Georgia Hines is released from alcohol rehab and returns to her Manhattan apartment and her friends: Jimmy, a gay unemployed actor, and Toby, a sophisticated socialite. She says she will maintain her sobriety and slowly ease back into theatre work.

Georgia&#x27;s teenaged daughter Polly, who has been living with her father and her new stepmother, asks if she could move in with her mother. Georgia agrees.

Georgia receives a phonecall from her ex-lover, writer David Lowe, who asks if they can meet. At dinner, David presents his new script, based on their turbulent, alcohol-filled relationship. He wants Georgia to play the lead/herself. She eventually agrees.

Georgia shines in rehearsals. When she confuses art with life during a scene and loses her composure, David consoles her and says that she is the only one who can do this part, kissing her on the cheek as he exits.

Meanwhile, Jimmy is given a part in another play. At her own rehearsals, Georgia brings David a gift-wrapped present. David is taken aback, then introduces Georgia to his new girlfriend. Georgia realizes that David&#x27;s affections towards her were only as a friend. She then learns that Toby&#x27;s husband has just asked for a divorce. Devastated for Toby, the circle of friends agrees to meet at her place that evening.

Georgia is greeted at the door by an impeccably dressed Toby. Georgia keeps refilling Toby&#x27;s champagne glass while Toby reminisces about life as an enviable college beauty, an untalented actress, and then a perfect wife. Toby&#x27;s composure crumbles and when she excuses herself to retouch her makeup, Georgia answers the door to a shaking Jimmy. He starts downing champagne and reveals that he was fired from his play, three nights before the opening. Georgia retreats to the kitchen and proceeds to drink multiple glasses of champagne. She returns to the room tipsy and tries to rally her friends, who are shocked after realizing she has started drinking again.

Polly, unaware of events, arrives at Toby&#x27;s with her new boyfriend. The three friends form a plan to conceal their problems from Polly, but Georgia, now very drunk, has an over-the-top reaction to Polly and her date. Polly realizes that Georgia has relapsed, and that Toby and Jimmy are back to covering up for her. She scolds Georgia for her insensitive attitude towards everyone around her, then storms out with her boyfriend.

Jimmy gets Georgia home, where she insists that Jimmy can trust her to be by herself. After he leaves, Georgia goes out to buy cigarettes at a neighborhood bar, but then sits down to start drinking and strikes up a flirty conversation with a stranger. When Georgia leaves, the stranger follows, drags her into an alley and beats her up.

A battered Georgia makes it to Toby&#x27;s, but begs her not to call the police. While Toby tends to Georgia&#x27;s wounded face, Georgia continues to drink. When Toby tries to make her see how self-destructive she has become, Georgia lashes out and mocks her. A furious Toby expresses that she has had it covering for Georgia, telling her to do everyone a favor and stop being such an “astronomical pain in the ass”. The two friends share a laugh and reconcile.

The next morning, Polly tries to convince Georgia to meet for lunch at Tavern at the Green with the father to discuss divided parental responsibilities, but Georgia circumnavigates the subject using the injury as excuse and eventually refuses. Georgia admits to Polly that she is not ready to handle the responsibilities of caring for another person. Polly feels rejected, again, by her mother&#x27;s decision. After Polly moves out, Georgia starts to accept Jimmy&#x27;s consoling when she realizes that she uses her friends to enable her behavior. Georgia later meets Polly and Polly&#x27;s father for lunch.

==Cast==
==Reception==
Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four and wrote, &quot;The only genuine moments amid the phony landscapes of this film come from Kristy McNichol, who turns in a wonderful performance as Mason&#x27;s daughter. McNichol carries conviction. She suggests the real passions and hurts that her character must feel. The other people in the movie seem to be drawn from superficial medical advice columns, advice for the lovelorn, and the character insights of popular songs.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also awarded it one star out of four and wrote, &quot;The script by Neil Simon is as phony as can be, with only McNichol giving any credibility to her character. The film would like to be funny and poignant, and it is neither.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was positive, writing that &quot;Mr. Simon&#x27;s screenplay is also one of his best, and it&#x27;s been treated with care by Glenn Jordan, a television director whose first theatrical film this is.&quot; Canby found the performances &quot;excellent&quot; with the exception of McNichol, whom he faulted for playing her role &quot;in that triply unreal manner of an adult actress imitating an old-time Hollywood child actress imitating an adult actress.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised a &quot;bravura performance&quot; from McNichol and added, &quot;Glenn Jordan&#x27;s economic direction is sensitively tuned to the border-treading emotions that populate the film, and manages to almost completely skirt the danger of hackneyed treatment this hardly virgin territory might easily have provoked.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;sleekly entertaining, well-produced (in part by Simon himself, a first for him) and a worthy successor to &#x27;The Goodbye Girl&#x27; and &#x27;Chapter Two.&#x27; David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; stated, &quot;Functioning for the first time as his own film producer, Simon made a wise choice in TV director Glenn Jordan. The pathos and the wisecracks don&#x27;t come at you with the usual relentlessness. Jordan gives both the audience and his excellent cast room to breathe and neatly keeps things just off the brink of overbearing melodrama.&quot;

&quot;Only When I Laugh&quot; holds a 63% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on eight reviews.

==Awards and nominations==
James Coco became the first performer in history to be nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Raspberry Award (as of its 1980 inception) for the same performance, for Supporting Actor. Since then, Amy Irving and Glenn Close have also achieved this same feat for their performances in &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983) and &quot;Hillbilly Elegy&quot; (2020), respectively, each in Supporting Actress.

==Home media==
The film is available for streaming rental and digital download through Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store and Amazon Video. Originally released on Laserdisc, CED Videodisc, and both VHS and Betamax videocassettes, the film is now available on DVD through Amazon via Columbia/Sony&#x27;s manufacture-on-demand (MOD) business.

<text>Renault, a French automobile manufacturer, has been associated with Formula One as both team owner and engine manufacturer for various periods since 1977. In 1977, the company entered Formula One as a constructor, introducing the turbo engine to Formula One with its EF1 engine. In 1983, Renault began supplying engines to other teams. Although the Renault team had won races, it withdrew at the end of . Renault engines continued to be raced until 1986.

Renault returned to Formula One in 1989 as an engine manufacturer. It won five drivers&#x27; titles and six constructors&#x27; titles between 1992 and 1997 with Williams and Benetton, before ending its works involvement after 1997, though their engines continued to be used without works backing until 2000.

In 2000, Renault acquired the Enstone-based Benetton Formula team (formerly Toleman). Renault became a works engine manufacturer again in 2001, and in 2002 the Enstone-based team was re-branded as Renault. The team won the drivers&#x27; and constructors&#x27; championships in 2005 and 2006.

By 2011, Renault had sold its shares in the Enstone-based team, though it continued to use the Renault chassis name in 2011. Renault remained in the sport as an engine manufacturer, winning four drivers&#x27; and constructors&#x27; titles with Red Bull Racing between 2010 and 2013.

The company bought the Enstone-based team again in 2016 and re-branded it as Renault. The team did not win in the following five seasons and was re-branded as Alpine in 2021 with the Renault marque remaining as engine manufacturer.

As a team owner, Renault has won two constructors&#x27; and drivers&#x27; championships, while as an engine manufacturer it has 12 constructors&#x27; and 11 drivers&#x27; championships. It has collected over 160 wins as engine supplier, ranking fourth in Formula One history.

== Constructor ==

=== Équipe Renault (1977–1985) ===
==== 1977–1978: Laying a foundation for turbo revolution ====

Renault&#x27;s first involvement in Formula One was made by the Renault Sport subsidiary. Renault entered the last five races of with Jean-Pierre Jabouille in its only car. The Renault RS01 was well known for its Renault-Gordini V6 1.5 L turbocharged engine, the first regularly used turbo engine in Formula One history. Jabouille&#x27;s car and engine proved highly unreliable and became something of a joke during its first races, earning the nickname of &quot;Yellow Teapot&quot; and failing to finish any of its races despite being comparatively powerful.

The first race the team, under the name Équipe Renault Elf, entered was the 1977 French Grand Prix, the ninth round of the season, but the car was not yet ready. The team&#x27;s début was delayed until the following round, the . The car&#x27;s first qualifying session was not a success, and Jabouille qualified 21st out of the 30 runners and 26 starters, 1.62 seconds behind pole sitter James Hunt in the McLaren. Jabouille ran well in the race, running as high as 16th before the car&#x27;s turbo failed on lap 17. The team missed the German and Austrian Grands Prix as the car was being improved after its British disappointment. They returned for the , and the qualifying performance was much improved as Jabouille qualified tenth. He had a poor start but ran as high as sixth before the suspension failed on lap 40.

The team&#x27;s poor qualifying form returned in Italy, as Jabouille qualified 20th. He ran outside the top 10 until his engine failed on lap 24, continuing their awful run of reliability. Things improved at Watkins Glen for the as Jabouille qualified 14th, but the good pace from Zandvoort seemed to be gone as he once again ran outside the top 10 before retiring with yet another reliability problem, this time the alternator, on lap 31. Jabouille failed to qualify in Canada; as 27 drivers entered the race, only one would not qualify, and this was Jabouille as he ended up last, over 7.5 seconds behind the fastest qualifier Mario Andretti of Lotus, and almost two seconds behind his nearest rival, Rupert Keegan, in the Hesketh. After this, Renault did not travel to the season finale in Japan.

The following year was hardly better, characterised by four consecutive retirements caused by blown engines, but near the end of the year, the team showed signs of success. Twice, the RS01 qualified 3rd on the grid and while finishing was still something of an issue, it managed to finish its first race on the lead lap at Watkins Glen near the end of , giving the team a fourth-place finish and its first Formula One points.

The team did not enter the first two races of 1978, in Argentina and Brazil, but returned for the at Kyalami. Jabouille secured Renault&#x27;s best qualifying position to date, with sixth place, just 0.71 seconds behind polesitter Niki Lauda in the Brabham. He dropped out of the points early in the race before retiring with electrical problems on lap 39. At Long Beach, Jabouille qualified 13th but retired as the turbo failed again on lap 44. He was twelfth in qualifying for the team&#x27;s first Monaco Grand Prix, and gave the team their first finish in Formula One, finishing in tenth place four laps down on race-winner Tyrrell&#x27;s Patrick Depailler.

==== 1979 season: Win breakthrough ====

Expanding to two drivers with René Arnoux joining Jabouille, the team continued to struggle although Jabouille earned a pole position in South Africa. By mid-season, both drivers had a new ground-effect car, the RS10, and at Dijon for the French Grand Prix the team legitimised itself with a brilliant performance in a classic race. The two Renaults were on the front row in qualifying, and pole-sitter Jabouille won the race, the first driver in a turbocharged car to do so, while Arnoux and Gilles Villeneuve were involved in an extremely competitive duel for second, Arnoux narrowly getting beaten to the line. While Jabouille ran into hard times after that race, Arnoux finished second at Silverstone in the following race and then repeated that at the Glen, proving it was not a fluke.

==== 1980–1983 seasons: Becoming an established frontrunner ====

Arnoux furthered this in with consecutive wins in Brazil and South Africa, both on high altitude circuits where the Renaults were dominant. Jabouille continued to have problems with retirements, but in his only points finish he emerged victorious in Austria. At the end of the year, Jabouille crashed heavily at the Canadian GP and suffered serious leg injuries, which effectively ended his career as a Grand Prix driver. Alain Prost was signed up for . In his three years with the team, Prost showed the form that would make him a Formula One legend and the Renaults were among the best in Formula One, twice finishing third in the Constructors&#x27; Championships and once second. Prost won nine races with the team, while Arnoux added two more in . Arnoux left for rival Ferrari after 1982 and was replaced by American Eddie Cheever. In , Renault and Prost came very close to winning the drivers&#x27; title but were edged out by Nelson Piquet (Brabham-BMW) at the last race of the season in South Africa. After the end of the season, a rival fuel company said that the fuel used by the Brabham-BMWs in South Africa had exceeded the maximum Research Octane Number of 102 permitted under the Formula One regulations. BMW said that this was incorrect and FISA released a dossier supporting their stance. No action was taken.

==== 1984–1985 seasons: Post-Prost decline and works team exit ====
Prost was fired two days after the 1983 season following his public comments about the team&#x27;s lack of development of the Renault RE40 which resulted in his loss to Piquet and the team&#x27;s loss to Ferrari in the 1983 championship. He subsequently joined McLaren, while Cheever left to join Alfa Romeo. The team turned to Frenchman Patrick Tambay (who had left Ferrari) and Englishman Derek Warwick (formerly of Toleman) to bring them back to prominence. Despite a few good results, including Tambay giving the team its last pole position at the 1984 French Grand Prix at Dijon, the team was not as competitive in and as in the past, with other teams doing a better job with turbo engines, or more specifically Lotus and to a lesser extent Ligier. provided another F1 first, as the team ran a third car in Germany at the new Nürburgring that featured the first in-car camera which could be viewed live by a television audience. Driven by Frenchman François Hesnault, the car only lasted 8 laps before a clutch problem forced it to retire (the last race on which a team entered three cars for a race). In 1985, major financial problems emerged at Renault and the company could no longer justify the large expenses needed to maintain the racing team&#x27;s competitiveness. CEO Georges Besse pared down the company&#x27;s involvement in F1 from full-fledged racing team to engine supplier for the season before taking it entirely out of F1 at the end of that year.

=== Renault F1 Team and Lotus Renault GP (2002–2011): The rise and fall of the first Enstone era ===
==== Purchase of and transition from Benetton Formula (2000–2001) ====
On 16 March 2000, the Renault-Nissan Alliance through the Renault brand purchased Benetton Formula Limited for $120 million, to return to Formula One. The history of the team acquired by Renault started in 1981 as the Toleman Motorsport team, based in Witney, Oxfordshire, England. In 1986, the team was renamed to Benetton Formula, following its purchase in 1985 by the Benetton family. In 1992/3 the team moved a few miles to a new base in Enstone. Renault continued to use the Benetton constructor name for the and the seasons, with the Renault name returning in 2001 as an engine brand. When reporting the purchase the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; commented that &quot;the team will not race under the Renault name until it is ready to win and reap the marketing benefits&quot;. It was not until 2002 that this name change occurred.

==== A promising first year under a new name (2002) ====

In , Benetton was rebranded as Renault F1 and contested the season with drivers Jarno Trulli and Jenson Button who scored 23 points during the season. As a result of rebranding, Renault received a French nationality license instead of Italian.

==== Emerging frontrunner (2003) ====

Despite outscoring his teammate during 2002, Button was dropped by Renault in . His replacement was Spain&#x27;s Fernando Alonso, who had been considered impressive as a test driver the previous year. Alonso won the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix, the first time Renault had won a Grand Prix since the 1983 Austrian Grand Prix. Renault was innovative during this period producing non-standard designs such as the 111° 10-cylinder engine for the 2003 RS23 which was designed to effectively lower the centre of gravity of the engine and thus improve the car&#x27;s handling. This eventually proved too unreliable and heavy, so Renault returned to a more conventional development route.

==== Monaco glory and third in Constructors&#x27; Championship (2004) ====

In , the team were contenders for second place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Trulli won the Monaco Grand Prix, but his relationship with Renault (particularly with team principal and Trulli&#x27;s ex-manager Flavio Briatore) deteriorated after he was consistently off the pace in the latter half of the year, and made claims of favouritism in the team towards Alonso (though the two teammates themselves remained friendly).

Commentators regularly point to the French Grand Prix as the final straw for Briatore, where Trulli was overtaken by Rubens Barrichello in the final stages of the last lap, costing Renault a double podium finish at their home Grand Prix. He subsequently announced he was joining Toyota for the following year and in fact left Renault early, driving the Toyota in the last two races of the 2004 season. Hoping to secure second place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Renault replaced Trulli with World Champion Jacques Villeneuve for the final three races. However, Villeneuve – away from F1 racing for almost an entire season and struggling to acclimatise quickly to racing at the premier level – did not impress, and the team finished third behind Villeneuve&#x27;s former team BAR.

==== Back to back double championship success (2005–2006) ====

Giancarlo Fisichella was Trulli&#x27;s replacement for the season. He took advantage of a rain-affected qualifying session to win the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix. Fernando Alonso then won the next three races to build a considerable lead in the Drivers&#x27; World Championship, thereby doing the same for Renault in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Meanwhile, Fisichella failed to finish several races. After the San Marino Grand Prix, Renault and Alonso&#x27;s championship leads came under attack from a fast-but-fragile McLaren-Mercedes team and Kimi Räikkönen respectively for the Drivers&#x27; Championship. McLaren took the lead of the Constructors&#x27; World Championship by securing a one-two finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix, but that was to be the race in which Alonso secured the Drivers&#x27; title, becoming the youngest ever driver to do so. This achievement was followed by a win in China to secure the Constructors&#x27; World Championship for Renault after McLaren driver Juan Pablo Montoya&#x27;s car was badly damaged by a drain cover coming loose on the track. This broke Ferrari&#x27;s six-year stranglehold on that title. It was the first time Renault had won the title as a manufacturer, and Renault became only the second French constructor (after the triumph of Matra in ) and the first French-licensed team to win the title.

Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella were retained for 2006, while test driver Franck Montagny was replaced by Heikki Kovalainen. The team&#x27;s 2006 contender, the R26 – featuring a seven-speed gearbox made of titanium, was unveiled at a launch event on 31 January.

Alonso won the opening Bahrain Grand Prix as well as the Australian Grand Prix and finished second in Malaysia behind teammate Fisichella to claim Renault&#x27;s first one-two finish since René Arnoux and Alain Prost in 1982. Alonso took two more second places, and then wins at his home Grand Prix in Spain, and at the Monaco Grand Prix. Fisichella took 8th, 6th and 3rd-place finishes in the San Marino Grand Prix, European Grand Prix and the Spanish Grand Prix.

The team celebrated its 200th Grand Prix at Silverstone, which was won by Alonso. As the season progressed to its North American stint, Alonso won the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, Canada. At the U.S Grand Prix, Ferrari had a distinct performance advantage over the whole weekend. However, Renault were the fastest of all the Michelin runners. Fisichella finished 3rd, while Alonso finished 5th.

At the French Grand Prix, Renault was expected to be faster than Ferrari, but Ferrari again had the advantage. Alonso ran third for most of the race, unable to challenge the Ferraris of Schumacher and Massa. However, a tactical switch to a two-stop strategy enabled him to pass Massa and finish second.

On 21 July 2006, the FIA banned the use of mass damper systems, developed and first used by Renault and subsequently used by 7 other teams, including Ferrari. Flavio Briatore claimed that McLaren had raised the issue of the system&#x27;s legality with the FIA. The system used a spring-mounted mass in the nose cone to reduce the sensitivity of the car to vibration. This was particularly effective in corners and over kerbs to keep the tyres in closer contact to the track surface than they would otherwise be. However race stewards at the German Grand Prix deemed the system legal. The FIA announced its intention to appeal that decision and Renault announced they would not race with the system for fear of retrospective punishment if the appeal was upheld. Renault&#x27;s performance at the German Grand Prix was one of their worst of the season; however, the team blamed blistering of their Michelin tyres rather than the loss of the mass damper system. The FIA International Court of Appeal met in Paris on 22 August 2006, to examine the appeal made by the FIA against the decision of the German Grand Prix stewards. The Court ruled that the use of the device known as a Tuned Mass Damper is an infringement of Article 3.15 of the Formula One Technical Regulations.

Points scored in the Brazilian Grand Prix secured the Constructors&#x27; Championship for Renault in 2006.

On 16 October 2006, Renault announced that the Dutch banking giant ING would replace Mild Seven as title sponsor for three years starting in .

==== Decline in fortunes without Alonso (2007) ====

Renault confirmed Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen as their race drivers for 2007 with Nelson Piquet Jr. and Ricardo Zonta as test drivers. The car for 2007, the R27, was unveiled on 24 January 2007 in Amsterdam and bore a new yellow, blue, orange and white livery in deference to the corporate colours of ING, the Dutch financial group based in Amsterdam. Renault engines were also supplied to the Red Bull Racing team for the 2007 season.

Renault struggled in comparison to their form in previous seasons in Australia, with Giancarlo Fisichella finishing the race in 5th place. Rookie Heikki Kovalainen struggled even more than the Italian, spinning his car as he chased Toyota&#x27;s Ralf Schumacher and ending up in 10th place. Results did not improve until the start of the European season, although both drivers finished in the points in the next race at Malaysia. Heikki Kovalainen struggled in Bahrain too, although the gap between himself and Fisichella at the end of the race was not as great as was seen at Melbourne, with Fisichella finishing only 8th. The team&#x27;s pace began to pick up in Barcelona, with both drivers making it into Q3, setting competitive lap times in the race (4th fastest lap for Kovalainen) and looking set for 5th and 8th, only to be hampered by an identical problem on both fuel rigs, forcing both drivers to make extra pitstops which dropped them back to 7th and 9th.

On 8 November 2007, the FIA accused Renault F1 of having McLaren F1 technical information in their possession. According to the charge, the information in hand &quot;included the layout and critical dimensions of the McLaren car as well as details of McLaren&#x27;s fuelling system, gear assembly, hydraulic control system and suspension&quot;. The hearing on this matter took place in Monaco on 6 December 2007. The charge faced by Renault F1 – breaching of article 151c of the Sporting Regulations – was the same as that faced by McLaren earlier on in 2007 in the espionage controversy involving Ferrari &amp; McLaren. The FIA found Renault F1 in breach of article 151c but did not penalise the team.

==== A season of mixed form (2008) ====

It was announced on 10 December 2007 that Fernando Alonso had signed with Renault F1 for . Alonso drove alongside promoted test driver Nelson Piquet Jr. and was believed to have secured number one status within the team. The team similarly started in 2008 as the year before; Fernando Alonso managed to garner fourth at the opening Australian Grand Prix as a result of a mistake from a previous Renault employee Heikki Kovalainen. However, the form was still short of 2006 by a large degree over the first half of the 2008 season. The team brought new parts to the Spanish Grand Prix, including a new engine-cover, dubbed the &quot;Shark-fin&quot;, similar to the one introduced by Red Bull on their RB4. Alonso managed to qualify on the front row for that race on a light fuel-load, yet retired with an engine failure halfway through. Alonso&#x27;s front row qualifying performance in Spain was a rare moment of achievement from the former World Champion. Both cars retired at the Canadian Grand Prix and Nelson Piquet Jr., who retired from six of the first nine races, failed to score until the French Grand Prix.

The German Grand Prix heralded a change in the team&#x27;s fortune. Piquet Jr. benefited from the deployment of the safety car to secure Renault&#x27;s first podium of the year with a second. Both drivers scored at the Hungarian Grand Prix although they failed to pick up anything at Valencia two weeks later. Two fourth places for Alonso in Belgium and Italy were a prelude to the Singapore Grand Prix, in which Alonso profited from the early crash of his teammate (later revealed to be a deliberate crash to aid the Spaniard. See: Renault Formula One crash controversy) to claim his first victory of the season, and Renault&#x27;s first since the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix. This victory made Alonso and Renault the first-ever winners of a Formula One race held under floodlights. Renault underlined their return to the front at the subsequent Japanese Grand Prix, in which Alonso steered clear of Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s first-corner mistake to record another win. Piquet Jr. finished fourth in the team&#x27;s best performance of the season. Further double points finish in China was followed by Alonso&#x27;s second-place finish at the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix. The Renault R28 was believed by many insiders to have overtaken BMW Sauber by season&#x27;s end as the closest challenger to the domination of the sport by Ferrari and McLaren. 

==== A season of on-track mediocrity and off track scandal (2009) ====
Renault entered the season with high hopes of challenging both world titles. Although Alonso managed four points finishes in the first six races, it was soon clear that this target was unrealistic. By mid-season, it appeared as though Renault were making progress, with Alonso setting the fastest lap in Germany and securing pole position in Hungary, albeit on a light fuel load. However, Alonso was forced to retire early in Hungary due to a fuel pump failure, after a front wheel came loose as it was incorrectly fitted at his first pit stop. At Belgium Alonso again looked like scoring a podium for the team but had to retire with another problem with one of his wheels which was damaged as a result of a first-lap clash with Adrian Sutil. Piquet performed poorly in the first half of the season and was replaced by Romain Grosjean for the last third of the season. Neither Piquet nor Grosjean managed to score a point. A podium in Singapore was little consolation in what had been a frustrating and controversial season for the team.
Renault had been suspended for one race (the 2009 European Grand Prix) due to the incident involving Fernando Alonso&#x27;s wheel not being fitted properly in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, however, this has been overturned on appeal following a decision from the FIA on 17 August 2009.

On 4 August, Nelson Piquet Jr. was told by Renault he would not continue driving for them for the rest of the season. &quot;I have received notice from Renault of its intention to stop me from driving for them in the current F1 season&quot;, read a statement on Piquet&#x27;s website. Piquet had described the season as &quot;the worst period of my career&quot; and had criticised team boss Flavio Briatore. He was replaced by test driver Romain Grosjean as of the .

After his first podium of the year in Singapore, Fernando Alonso confirmed that he would be leaving Renault, moving to Ferrari in 2010.

;Race rigging allegations
During the 2009 season, the actions of Renault F1 during the 2008 season were examined over alleged race-fixing. The issue surrounded Nelson Piquet Jr.&#x27;s crash during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix which Renault teammate Fernando Alonso went on to win. At the time, Piquet Jr. had characterised the incident as a simple mistake. After Piquet Jr. left the Renault team in August 2009, allegations surfaced that this crash had been deliberate, to give an advantage to Alonso. Following a Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) investigation in which Piquet Jr. stated he had been asked by Renault team principal Flavio Briatore and engineer Pat Symonds to stage the crash, on 4 September 2009 Renault were charged with conspiracy and race-fixing and were due to face the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 21 September 2009. Initially, Renault and Briatore stated they would take legal action against Piquet Jr. for making false allegations, however, before the meeting, Renault announced they would not contest the charges, and that Briatore and Symonds had left the team. At the meeting, the Council banned Renault from Formula One, but suspended this sanction for two years, meaning Renault would have been thrown out of Formula One if a similar incident occurred before the end of the 2011 season. FIA stated that Renault would have likely been thrown out of Formula One if it had not taken swift action in pushing out Briatore and Symonds. At the same meeting, Briatore was banned from FIA events for life, while Symonds received a five-year ban. The bans on Briatore and Symonds were subsequently overturned by a French court in 2010. FIA, Briatore and Symonds reached a settlement that allowed Briatore and Symonds to return to FIA in 2011 and to Formula One in 2013.

==== Team sale amid Kubica promise (2010) ====

In 2010, Renault sold a majority stake in the team to Genii Capital, a Luxembourg based investment company. However Renault still retained a 25% share in the team and continued as an engine supplier. Red Bull Racing confirmed they would be using Renault engines for . Robert Kubica was signed as Alonso&#x27;s replacement on 7 October 2009, but following the shareholding deal, Kubica and his manager Daniel Morelli asked for clarification on the management structure before committing to the outfit. However, in the new year, clarification was sought and Kubica was ready to commit to the outfit. On 31 January, Vitaly Petrov was signed to be Kubica&#x27;s teammate, becoming Russia&#x27;s first Formula One driver.

On 5 January, Éric Boullier was announced as the new team principal at Renault, replacing Bob Bell, who would return to his former role as Technical Director.

At the opening round in Bahrain, Petrov retired with broken suspension while in the pit lane on lap 14, and Kubica finished in eleventh place.

Kubica took his first podium with the team, with a second-place finish in Australia. Petrov retired from the race, after spinning off the circuit.

Kubica finished the next 3 races in the points, a 4th place in Malaysia, 5th place in Shanghai, and 8th place in Barcelona. Petrov meanwhile scored his first points in Formula 1 in China with his 7th place, it could have been more, but he spun off whilst in fourth, yet he still recovered to bring some points home.

After setting fast times on Thursday and the fastest time in Saturday&#x27;s practice session, followed by 2nd place in qualifying, Kubica finished in 3rd place in Monaco, just 1.6 seconds behind the winner. Petrov retired in the closing laps of the race but was still classified 13th.

Vitaly Petrov was out-qualified and out-raced by Robert Kubica at almost every race. However, Petrov did find considerable form at the when he out-qualified Kubica for the first time and finished the race 5th. However, in Belgium, Petrov made a mistake that ended with a crash in the first session of qualifying when he explored the kerbs at Liege corner, claiming he was testing to see how wet they were and if they were usable on his flying lap. His failure to set a time placed him 24th on the grid, though a gearbox penalty to Sauber&#x27;s Pedro de la Rosa promoted him to 23rd. However, he went on to finish ninth, resulting in three consecutive points finishes in a row. In Singapore, Petrov was running seventh before being pushed off by Nico Hülkenberg, whilst Kubica was forced to make an unscheduled stop late in the race with a puncture, before going on to recover almost every place he had lost.

Rumours had tipped World Champion Kimi Räikkönen to replace Petrov for , but the Finn angrily rejected claims he would join the team, stating that he was upset Renault was using his name for their image and that their actions meant he would not race for them.

==== Lotus Renault GP: Renault steps back (2011) ====

On 5 November 2010, Autosport reported that Renault was poised to scale back its involvement in 2011 and become only an engine supplier, with the team closing in on a tie-up with Lotus Cars to buy its 25% stake in the team. The deal was finalised in early December 2010, with the team to be renamed Lotus Renault GP for 2011, under a sponsorship deal signed with Lotus Cars until 2017. Renault continued to support the team by supplying engines and its expertise and thus Red Bull Racing was promoted to Renault&#x27;s full-works partnership team. The Renault chassis name continued to be used, with Renault branding featuring in the new black and gold livery that was last used when Renault and Lotus joined forces in the 1980s, harking back to the John Player Special livery of the time. Despite being rebranded to Lotus, Renault still supplied free engines for the Lotus team until 2014.

During 2011, the team raced against another team that was using the Lotus name. The team which raced in the 2010 season as Lotus Racing (using a licence from Group Lotus which was later terminated by Group Lotus) rebranded itself as &quot;Team Lotus&quot; for the 2011 season after purchasing the privately owned rights to the historic name.

In January 2011, team principal Éric Boullier announced that the team would race under a British licence in , having raced as a French outfit since Renault took over in . This left the sport without any team racing under a French licence for the first time since the season. Group Lotus had yet to purchase a stake in the team, but had an option to do so by the end of . Along with the launch of their new car, Lotus Renault GP announced that they had hired Jean Alesi as an ambassador for the team and test driver for the T125 single-seater project.

On 6 February 2011, Robert Kubica was severely injured in an accident during a rally in Italy. It was unclear if he would be able to return to Formula One during the 2011 season. On 16 February, it was announced that Nick Heidfeld was signed as Kubica&#x27;s replacement, while Kubica still remained signed with the team for 2011.

At the , Petrov took his first and only podium in Formula One, finishing third, and Heidfeld finished twelfth with a damaged car. Heidfeld finished third in the next race in Malaysia, while Petrov retired late on; he hit a bump caused by a drainage gully which launched his car into the air and broke the car&#x27;s steering column on landing. In the Chinese Grand Prix, Petrov finished ninth having started tenth after a mechanical problem in qualifying, with Heidfeld finishing twelfth. Heidfeld and Petrov finished seventh and eighth in Turkey, as the team&#x27;s early-season performance began to fade. Heidfeld finished ninth in Spain after missing qualifying due to a fire in practice, while Petrov finished just outside the points in eleventh place. Heidfeld scored more points in Monaco with eighth place, while Petrov retired after being caught up in an accident involving several other cars. Petrov finished fifth in the rain-affected , with Heidfeld retiring after damaging his car&#x27;s front wing in a collision with Kamui Kobayashi. The team endured a difficult weekend in Valencia, as Heidfeld scored a single point for tenth place and Petrov finished 15th.

New restrictions over the use of off-throttle blown diffusers were introduced for the , and the team was badly affected having designed their car around the system. Heidfeld managed 8th place in the race, with Petrov 12th. Heidfeld was replaced by Bruno Senna for the in August.

On 29 November 2011, the team confirmed that they had hired Kimi Räikkönen to drive full-time in 2012. On 9 December 2011, the team also confirmed that Romain Grosjean would join Räikkönen in 2012. During the 2012 season, the team would be known as the Lotus F1 Team.

=== Renault Sport Formula One Team and Renault F1 Team (2016–2020): The second Enstone era ===
==== 2016 season: Struggles in first season back ====
On 28 September 2015, Renault Sport F1 announced that a letter of intent between Renault Group and Gravity Motorsports which is owned by Genii Capital had been signed and over the following weeks a takeover transaction would be discussed for the Lotus F1 Team (also known as Team Enstone which was previously owned by Renault until 2010) in hopes that the team would compete in the season as Renault Sport Formula One Team in response to the collapse of Renault&#x27;s relationship with Red Bull. It was speculated that F1 veteran Alain Prost, who drove for Renault from 1981 to 1983, could take a senior role in the team.

On 3 December 2015, Renault announced that they had purchased the Lotus F1 Team and were preparing for the 2016 season with further information to be released in early 2016. As Renault returned to Formula One as a full-works constructor team, Red Bull Racing was officially demoted to Renault&#x27;s customer team and thus received TAG Heuer rebadging sponsorship from 2016 to 2018 seasons.

On 3 February 2016, Renault unveiled the testing livery for their 2016 car, the Renault R.S.16, and confirmed Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer as its two race drivers, 2015 GP3 champion Esteban Ocon as its reserve driver, Carmen Jordá as its development driver, and that multiple drivers, including 2015 Formula Renault 3.5 champion Oliver Rowland, Jack Aitken, Louis Delétraz and Kevin Jorg are a part of its driver academy. Additionally, Bob Bell (formerly of Mercedes, Marussia and the previous incarnation of Renault) was confirmed as the team&#x27;s chief technical officer and Frédéric Vasseur (of ART Grand Prix) as the new racing director. Renault Sport F1 is mainly partnered with the Renault-Nissan Alliance. However it also has other sponsorships with partners including Bell &amp; Ross, Devialet, EMC, Genii Capital, Infiniti, Total, CD-adapco, Microsoft, Pirelli, OZ Racing and Jack &amp; Jones.

The team finished the season in ninth place with 8 points.

==== 2017 season: Improved results ====
On 11 January 2017, Frédéric Vasseur left the team after disagreements with team personnel, therefore the team was managed by president Jérôme Stoll and managing director Cyril Abiteboul.

On 14 October 2016, it was announced that Nico Hülkenberg would join the team for the season. Kevin Magnussen later chose to leave the team to join Haas, with Jolyon Palmer remaining at the team for a second season, but was replaced by Carlos Sainz Jr. from the onwards, after only one point scoring finish. Sainz had a good debut at the United States Grand Prix, finishing seventh and out qualifying his teammate who retired from the race. The team finished the season in sixth place with 57 points.

==== 2018 season: Best result in the Constructors&#x27; Championship ====
Nico Hülkenberg continued to drive for Renault in 2018 as he had signed a multi-year deal the year before. After joining the team mid-season in 2017, Carlos Sainz Jr. continued to drive for them in 2018. They finished 4th in the championship with 122 points.

==== 2019 season: Ricciardo-era starts ====
On 3 August 2018, it was announced that Red Bull Racing driver Daniel Ricciardo would be joining the team on a two-year deal to partner Hülkenberg.

Plagued by reliability issues at the start of the season, and aerodynamic poor performance, the team finished 5th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, failing to escape the midfield. Also of note was the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix, which the team was disqualified from as a result of their automatic brake balance changing system, which was deemed illegal.

At the end of the season, the team announced changes to the aerodynamic department of their team as a result of the R.S.19&#x27;s failures. Chassis Technical Director Nick Chester would leave the team, with former Ferrari and McLaren chassis engineer Pat Fry and former Williams and Ferrari aerodynamicist Dirk de Beer to join the team.

==== 2020 season: Return to podium and final year of Renault F1 Team ====
Former Racing Point Force India driver and Mercedes reserve driver Esteban Ocon joined Renault for the 2020 season, on a multiple-year contract, replacing Nico Hülkenberg. The start of the 2020 season was postponed until July in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Belgium, Renault finished 4th and 5th, scoring 23 points in one single race, their most in any race ever as a constructor and their first fastest lap for a decade. At the Eifel Grand Prix raced on the Nürburgring circuit, Ricciardo scored a third-place finish with his R.S.20, the team&#x27;s first podium since Malaysia 2011. Ricciardo also scored a third-place finish at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. Ocon also scored a second-place finish at the Sakhir Grand Prix, his first podium and Renault&#x27;s third of the season. Ricciardo finished 5th in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings, while Ocon finished 12th. Renault finished 5th in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship standings with 181 points.

Renault was rebranded as Alpine for the 2021 season.

== Engine supplier (1983–2025) ==

=== Original turbo era (1983–1986) ===

Renault began manufacturing engines at the Viry-Châtillon factory in 1976, after closing the former Alpine competition department, which was run in conjunction with the Formula One team under the Renault Sport division. It manufactured the first turbocharged engine seen on the category, the Renault-Gordini EF1 1.5 litres V6, at a time where the naturally aspirated 3-litre engines were predominant. Initially only supplying engines to the works team, Renault began a customer programme in 1983 when it became Team Lotus&#x27; engine supplier. Mecachrome, a precision engineering company, prepared the engines for the customer teams.

Though not competitive initially, with the recruitment of designer Gérard Ducarouge the marque gained competitiveness towards the later part of the 1983 season into 1984, with Nigel Mansell and Elio de Angelis scoring regular podiums. That year, Renault also began supplying engines to the Ligier team, which scored three points in 1984, an improvement over not being classified in the 1983 championship. Ayrton Senna joined Team Lotus in 1985 and the combination of his talent and the fast, but fuel-inefficient Lotus 97T gained eight pole positions and three wins (two to Senna, one to de Angelis), but unreliability prevented a sustained attempt at either title. The Tyrrell team started using the Renault engine from the seventh Grand Prix of the year, while Ligier gained three podiums in the Ligier JS25. In 1986, aristocrat Johnny Dumfries was chosen to be Senna&#x27;s new partner at Lotus after Senna vetoed the original choice of Derek Warwick. More pole positions and two wins for the Brazilian followed with the Lotus 98T, but the car followed similar problems as its predecessor with reliability problems and poor fuel consumption. This saw to it that Lotus could not sustain a season-long challenge to leading teams McLaren and Williams.

After the 1985 season, the Renault works team ended participation in Formula One but continued as an engine supplier for Ligier, Tyrrell and Lotus. 1986 saw the introduction of the EF15B engine, which included several innovations, like static ignition and pneumatic valve return. Renault Sport stopped its engine program at the end of the year, having scored 19 pole positions and 5 Grand Prix victories with customer teams.

=== Return to naturally aspirated engines (1989–2013) ===
==== Success with Williams and Benetton (1989–1997) ====
Renault returned as a Formula One engine supplier in 1989 with the banning of turbocharged engines, in partnership with the Williams team. The Viry factory produced the first pneumatic valved 3.5 V10 engine, the RS1, while other engine manufacturers supplied V8 (Ford, Judd and Yamaha), V10 (Honda), or V12 (Ferrari and Lamborghini) engines. The Williams-Renault combination scored its first victory at the wet 1989 Canadian Grand Prix, with Thierry Boutsen, and finished their initial season together with Boutsen winning the very wet 1989 Australian Grand Prix.

Williams had signs of promise for the next 2 years and by , with the aid of active suspension and better engines, the Williams-Renault was a World Championship-winning car, winning over half of the races during the season, as its driver Nigel Mansell won the drivers&#x27; title. Former customer team Ligier also resumed using the same works Renault engines as Williams in 1992. The championship was won again by Williams in , using the technologically advanced Williams FW15C car – the team had developed technology such as anti-lock brakes, traction control and power steering, along with using the RS5 engine with a redesigned intake and combustion. Alain Prost won the Drivers&#x27; Championship after winning 7 of the 16 rounds, and his teammate Damon Hill won another three Grands Prix.

 saw Williams driver Ayrton Senna killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, which left the Brazilian&#x27;s inexperienced teammate Damon Hill as team leader. Hill was 37 points behind Championship leader Michael Schumacher by the French Grand Prix, but had managed to close the gap down to 1 point before the last race in Adelaide. The two drivers collided controversially and retired from the race, making Schumacher the Drivers&#x27; Champion while Williams retained the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

In 1995 engine regulations reduced maximum engine displacement to three litres, with Renault adapting the RS7, making it lighter and featuring a fly-by-wire throttle. Benetton acquired Ligier&#x27;s Renault engines for and their driver, Michael Schumacher, managed to successfully defend his drivers&#x27; title by 33 points from his nearest rival, Damon Hill. Benetton won the constructors&#x27; title by 29 points, winning 11 races during the season. Williams won the next two seasons in both the drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championship with Damon Hill winning the title in and Jacques Villeneuve in . Schumacher and other Benetton staff left for Ferrari in 1996, and the team finished in the third position for both years.

==== Initial end of factory Renault engines, Mecachrome and Supertec (1998–2000) ====

Renault left the F1 again at the end of 1997, and evolutions of its last engine, the RS9, were still used by many teams during the following seasons. Renault continued working with Mecachrome, which paid for development of the engines, and supplied them to Williams under the Mecachrome name. Benetton continued to use the engines under the Playlife brand until 2000, although only achieved several podiums during this time. Flavio Briatore&#x27;s company Supertec distributed the engines from 1999, with Williams and BAR using them under the Supertec name that year, and the Arrows cars using them in 2000, while Benetton used them under the Playlife name in 1999 and 2000. Although on a few occasions points were scored, ultimately the engines were not successful under Supertec&#x27;s control, subsequently all but one team moved to another supplier after one season.

==== Return to customer supply with Red Bull Racing yields title success (2007–2010) ====
After Renault purchased the Benetton team, they did not supply customer engines until , when they signed an agreement with Red Bull Racing on 15 September 2006. Red Bull were a midfield team during the first two years of the partnership, before a change in regulations for the season allowed Red Bull to claim their first victory at the . Drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber took five further victories that year to allow the team to finish second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. In 2010, Vettel and Red Bull won both championships, making it the ninth title for a Renault engine, and the first for the RS27.

==== Further title successes as an engine supplier with Red Bull Racing (2011–2013) ====

At the end of 2010, when Renault sold their remaining stake in the Enstone-based Formula One team, the engine operations at Viry-Châtillon were formed into a subsidiary known as Renault Sport F1. Renault Sport F1 continued to supply engines to their former works team and Red Bull, and expanded their customers to Lotus Racing at the end of 2010. As a result of Renault&#x27;s full-constructor team being rebranded to Lotus Renault GP, Red Bull Racing was officially promoted to Renault&#x27;s full-works partnership team and thus received free engines from Renault and thanks to Infiniti sponsorship. Red Bull again won both titles in , the Red Bull RB7 being unmatched by their opponents, and gained 18 pole positions throughout the season. Vettel held the championship lead from the first race in Australia, and finished in first or second position in each Grand Prix until his home race at Germany, where he ended in fourth. He then resumed his podium run, with the exception of one retirement, until the end of the season, while Webber finished behind until the final two races. In 2012, the Red Bull team and Sebastian Vettel were able to achieve both championships for a third time, despite the fact the RB8 car did not enjoy the dominance of the previous season and suffered some reliability problems related to the RS27&#x27;s alternator. That year, Williams returned to its association with Renault, signing a deal to receive the RS27 engines until the end of 2013. Red Bull came back to a dominant pace in the 2013 season and both the team and Sebastian Vettel secured their fourth consecutive title at the 2013 Indian Grand Prix.

=== Struggles in the V6 turbo-hybrid era and the end of engine supply (2014–2025) ===

Renault developed a new 1.6-litre V6 turbocharged engine, the Renault Energy F1-2014, in line with the new regulations for with APC Pankl Turbosystems GmbH supplying hybrid turbocharger kits for Renault Formula One engines from 2014 until 2020 and BorgWarner supplying them from 2021 onwards. On 21 June 2013, Renault unveiled its new engine at the Paris Air Show. It was named Energy F1 after the Renault&#x27;s road car engines. Red Bull and Caterham (formerly Lotus Racing/Team Lotus) had deals to use Renault engines until 2016. At the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix, Scuderia Toro Rosso announced a customer engine supply contract with Renault for the original period 2014–2016.

During the early 2014 tests in Jerez the new Renault engines showed problems with both the turbo unit and the energy recovery systems. Partial fixes were introduced for the last pre-season tests in Bahrain, especially software upgrades. In the early part of the season, the Energy F1-2014 was the subject of various criticisms for its poor reliability and lack of top speed, including one by Red Bull&#x27;s boss Christian Horner which described the performance as &quot;unacceptable&quot; after an unsuccessful team&#x27;s home race in Austria. Renault introduced revised components and more software upgrades trying to reduce the gap with rivals.

In 2015, Red Bull unilaterally terminated their contract for 2016 with Renault, alleging a lack of performance from the Renault Energy F1-2015 compared to rivals. However, they later renegotiated their agreement, as plans from Red Bull to get a more competitive power unit failed. In 2016, the Renault power units used by Red Bull would be badged as TAG Heuer. Renault then terminated their 2016 engine supply agreement with Scuderia Toro Rosso, and the team returned to their former supplier Ferrari. During 2016, Red Bull GmbH renewed their contract for a further two years for Red Bull Racing. They also announced that Scuderia Toro Rosso would also return to Renault power from 2017. However, the contract still gave Red Bull the option to badge their engines as they wish, with Christian Horner stating that Red Bull Racing would continue with the TAG Heuer badging without Renault works support.

In September 2017, Renault and McLaren announced the latter would use customer Renault engines from 2018 to 2020 in order to aid the competitiveness of the Renault works team. Toro Rosso in turn switched to full-works Honda engines, terminating their 2018 customer deal with Renault. In June 2018, Red Bull announced they would also use full-works Honda engines from 2019 onwards. As McLaren ended its Renault customer partnership due to switching to Mercedes power units from 2021 season, Renault returned to single-team engine supply for the first time since the 2006 season.

The Enstone-based team was rebranded to Alpine from the 2021 season onwards while Renault was retained as the engine make, marking the first time since 2015 that the Renault brand would be in Formula One solely as an engine supplier.

However, despite the rebranding of the Enstone team and a win for Alpine driver Esteban Ocon at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix, the Renault power unit still continued to struggle overall relative to the competition from Honda, Ferrari and Mercedes. During 2023, Alpine – whose A523 car was on average 0.9 seconds slower than the pacesetting Honda-powered Red Bull RB19 – claimed their car had been cost half a second of performance versus its competitors purely because of the lacklustre Renault power unit. With a power unit more on par with its rivals, Alpine claimed the A523 would have been in performance terms about on par with the Mercedes W14.

Due to the lack of success and unreliability of their engines since the beginning of the V6 turbo-hybrid era in 2014, on 29 September 2024, Renault announced that it would be ending its works engine programme and would therefore cease to provide engines for Alpine after 2025, when revised engine regulations are set to be introduced in 2026. Groupe Renault CEO Luca de Meo has stated financial reasons as the main reason behind ending the programme, claiming that it would be cheaper to purchase a power unit from another manufacturer than continue to develop one in-house. Said manufacturer would be revealed by Alpine to be Mercedes, becoming a customer team by utilising their engines and gearboxes from the 2026 season onward.

<text>Brand equity, in marketing, is the worth of a brand in and of itself – i.e., the social value of a well-known brand name. The owner of a well-known brand name can generate more revenue simply from brand recognition, as consumers perceive the products of well-known brands as better than those of lesser-known brands.

In the research literature, brand equity has been studied from two different perspectives: cognitive psychology and information economics. According to cognitive psychology, brand equity lies in consumer&#x27;s awareness of brand features and associations, which drive attribute perceptions. According to information economics, a strong brand name works as a credible signal of product quality for imperfectly informed buyers and generates price premiums as a form of return to branding investments. It has been empirically demonstrated that brand equity plays an important role in the determination of price structure and, in particular, firms are able to charge price premiums that derive from brand equity after controlling for observed product differentiation.

==The brand equity concept==
It has been said that brand equity is &quot;the branding of a product name on an attention-deficit public.&quot;

While most brand equity research has taken place in consumer markets, the concept of brand equity is also important for understanding competitive dynamics and price structures of business-to-business markets. In industrial markets competition is often based on differences in product performance. It has been suggested however that firms may charge premiums that cannot be solely explained in terms of technological superiority and performance-related advantages. Such price premiums reflect the brand equity of reputable manufacturers. Three brand equity drivers were selected by researchers from numerous factors that have impact on a brand: brand awareness, brand perspective, and brand attachment.

Brand equity is strategically crucial, but famously difficult to quantify. Many experts have developed tools to analyze this asset, but there is no agreed way to measure it. As one of the serial challenges that marketing professionals and academics find with the concept of brand equity, the disconnect between and equity values is difficult to reconcile. Quantitative brand equity includes numerical values such as profit margins and market share, but fails to capture qualitative elements such as prestige and associations of interest. Overall, most marketing practitioners take a more qualitative approach to brand equity because of this challenge. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, only 26 percent responded that they found the &quot;brand equity&quot; metric very useful.

Some marketing researchers have concluded that brands are one of the most valuable assets a company has, as brand equity is one of the factors which can increase the financial value of a brand to the brand owner, although not the only one. Elements that can be included in the valuation of brand equity include (but not limited to): changing market share, profit margins, consumer recognition of logos and other visual elements, brand language associations made by consumers, consumers&#x27; perceptions of quality and other relevant brand values.

Consumers&#x27; knowledge about a brand also governs how manufacturers and advertisers market the brand. Brand equity is created through strategic investments in communication channels and market education and appreciates through economic growth in profit margins, market share, value, and critical associations. Generally, these strategic investments appreciate over time to deliver a return on investment. This is directly related to marketing ROI. Brand equity can also appreciate without strategic direction. A Stockholm University study in 2011 documents the case of Jerusalem&#x27;s city brand. The city organically developed a brand, which experienced tremendous brand equity appreciation over the course of centuries through non-strategic activities. A booming tourism industry in Jerusalem has been the most evident indicator of a strong ROI.

== Purpose ==

The purpose of brand equity metrics is to measure the value of a brand. A brand encompasses the name, logo, image, and perceptions that identify a product, service, or provider in the minds of customers. It takes shape in advertising, packaging, and other marketing communications, and becomes a focus of the relationship with consumers. In time, a brand comes to embody a promise about the goods it identifies—a promise about quality, performance, or other dimensions of value, which can influence consumers&#x27; choices among competing products. When consumers trust a brand and find it relevant, they may select the offerings associated with that brand over those of competitors, even at a premium price. When a brand&#x27;s promise extends beyond a particular product, its owner may leverage it to enter new markets. For all these reasons, a brand can hold tremendous value, which is known as &quot;brand equity&quot;.

Social media has changed the traditional communication between brands and consumers and enabled consumer to make positive as well as negative influence on brand equity.

Brand Equity is best managed with the development of brand equity goals, which are then used to track progress and performance.

== Construction ==

There are many ways to measure a brand. Some measurements approaches are at the firm level, some at the product level and still others are at the consumer level.

Firm Level: Firm level approaches measure the brand as a financial asset. In short, a calculation is made regarding how much the brand is worth as an intangible asset. For example, if you were to take the value of the firm, as derived by its market capitalization—and then subtract tangible assets and &quot;measurable&quot; intangible assets—the residual would be the brand equity. Measuring brand equity in this way is often referred to as brand valuation. The modeling is closely related to brand equity, and a number of models and approaches have been developed by different consultancies. Brand valuation models typically combine a brand equity measure (e.g.: the proportion of sales contributed by &quot;brand&quot;) with commercial metrics such as revenue or economic profit.

Product Level: The classic product level brand measurement example is to compare the price of a no-name or private label product to an &quot;equivalent&quot; branded product. The difference in price, assuming all things equal, is due to the brand. More recently a revenue premium approach has been advocated. Marketing mix modeling can isolate &quot;base&quot; and &quot;incremental&quot; sales, and it is sometimes argued that base sales approximate to a measure of brand equity. More sophisticated marketing mix models have a floating base that can capture changes in underlying brand equity for a product over time.

Consumer Level: This approach seeks to map the mind of the consumer to find out what associations with the brand the consumer has. This approach seeks to measure the awareness (recall and recognition) and brand image (the overall associations that the brand has). Free association tests and projective techniques are commonly used to uncover the tangible and intangible attributes, attitudes, and intentions about a brand. Brands with high levels of awareness and strong, favorable and unique associations are high equity brands.

All of these calculations are, at best, approximations. A more complete understanding of the brand can occur if multiple measures are used.

===Positive brand equity vs. negative brand equity===

Brand equity is the positive effect of the brand on the difference between the prices that the consumer accepts to pay when the brand is known compared to the value of the benefit received.

There are two schools of thought regarding the existence of negative brand equity. One perspective states brand equity cannot be negative, hypothesizing only positive brand equity is created by marketing activities such as advertising, PR, and promotion. A second perspective is that negative equity can exist, due to catastrophic events to the brand, such as a wide product recall or continued negative press attention (Blackwater or Halliburton, for example).

Colloquially, the term &quot;negative brand equity&quot; may be used to describe a product or service where a brand has a negligible effect on a product level when compared to a no-name or private label product.

===Family branding vs. individual branding strategies===

The greater a company&#x27;s brand equity, the greater the probability that the company will use a family branding strategy rather than an individual branding strategy. This is because family branding allows them to leverage the equity accumulated in the core brand. Aspects of brand equity include: brand loyalty, awareness, association and perception of quality.

===Automobile Industry===

One of Oldsmobile&#x27;s best known brands was &quot;Cutlass&quot;. First used in 1961, by the 1980s it was confusingly used on three different platforms, with the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera becoming Oldsmobile&#x27;s best selling model, which at different times would be sold alongside the smaller Cutlass Calais, and a newer Cutlass Supreme. The Aurora-inspired Intrigue introduced in 1988 retired the aging Cutlass nameplate with the intention to recast Oldsmobile into a future as in import fighter and its stodgy past as existing model names which had served in the past, including Cutlass, were phased out. But sales would continue to decline, as Cutlass briefly re-appeared as a rebadged Malibu in 1997. To reduce costs at General Motors by consolidating a profusion of divisions, the Oldsmobile division was entirely phased out in 2004.

Rival GM division Chevrolet re-entered the midsize market when the company resurrected the Malibu nameplate in 1997 (and later the Impala in 2000 as their answer to imports e.g. the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry including its stretched platform Avalon) which had been dormant since 1983 when the company phased out its remaining RWD midsize G platform. As of the 2018 model year, both nameplates are still in production. The Malibu, originally part of the mid-size Chevelle lineup until 1977 as the top trim level, GM promoted its trim level to full model status (at the time the Chevelle nameplate was retired (and has remained dormant since because of its association with the musclecar era) its trim level had brand recognition and better known), a practice first demonstrated in 1969 when the Chevy II lineup was rebadged (the Nova was the top trim level; it was one of the finalists for the official model name dating back to 1962 but Chevrolet management wanted its car nameplates beginning with a &quot;C&quot; – the promotion of the Nova from trim level to official model status broke the tradition of using C-word names by Chevrolet with its automobile and truck product lineup on a selective basis.

The Lincoln-Mercury division of the Ford Motor Company best known brand throughout the late 1960s to 2002 was the Mercury Cougar – first used as a twin to the Ford Mustang and later a personal luxury coupe sharing its platform with its midsize Torino lineup until 1977 when its entire midsize lineup (at the time branded as the Montego) was rebadged as part of the Cougar lineup which went viral (from a base coupe to a station wagon) until the early 1980s when L-M repositioned its midsized lineup by rebadging the Cougar under the Marquis nameplate.

In the early 2000s in North America, the Ford Motor Company made a strategic decision to brand all new or redesigned cars with names starting with &quot;F.&quot; This aligned with the previous tradition of naming all sport utility vehicles since the Ford Explorer with the letter &quot;E.&quot; The Toronto Star quoted an analyst who warned that changing the name of the well known Windstar to the Freestar would cause confusion and discard brand equity built up, while a marketing manager believed that a name change would highlight the new redesign. The aging Taurus, which became one of the most significant cars in American auto history, would be abandoned in favor of three entirely new names, all starting with &quot;F,&quot; the Five Hundred, Freestar, and Fusion. By 2007, the Freestar was discontinued without a replacement. The Five Hundred name was thrown out and Taurus was brought back for the next generation of that car in a surprise move by Alan Mulally.

In practice, brand equity is difficult to measure. Because brands are crucial assets, however, both marketers and academic researchers have devised means to contemplate their value. Some of these techniques are described below.

== Methodologies ==

===Brand Equity Ten (Aaker)===

David Aaker, a marketing professor and brand consultant, highlights ten attributes of a brand that can be used to assess its strength. These include Differentiation, Satisfaction or Loyalty, Perceived Quality, Leadership or Popularity, Perceived Value, Brand Personality, Organizational Associations, Brand Awareness, Market Share, and Market Price and Distribution Coverage. Aaker doesn&#x27;t weight the attributes or combine them in an overall score, as he believes any weighting would be arbitrary and would vary among brands and categories. Rather he recommends tracking each attribute separately.

===Brand Equity Index (Moran)===

Marketing executive Bill Moran has derived an index of brand equity as the product of three factors:
* &quot;Effective Market Share&quot; is a weighted average. It represents the sum of a brand&#x27;s market shares in all segments in which it competes, weighted by each segment&#x27;s proportion of that brand&#x27;s total sales.
* &quot;Relative Price&quot; is a ratio. It represents the price of goods sold under a given brand, divided by the average price of comparable goods in the market.
* &quot;Durability&quot; is a measure of customer retention or loyalty. It represents the percentage of a brand&#x27;s customers who will continue to buy goods under that brand in the following year.

===BrandAsset Valuator (Young &amp; Rubicam)===

Young &amp; Rubicam, a marketing communications agency, has developed the BrandAsset Valuator, BAV, a tool to diagnose the power and value of a brand. In using it, the agency surveys consumers&#x27; perspectives along four dimensions:
* &quot;Differentiation:&quot; The defining characteristics of the brand and its distinctiveness relative to competitors.
* &quot;Relevance:&quot; The appropriateness and connection of the brand to a given consumer.
* &quot;Esteem:&quot; Consumers&#x27; respect for and attraction to the brand.
* &quot;Knowledge:&quot; Consumers&#x27; awareness of the brand and understanding of what it represents.

===Brand Contribution to Market Cap Method (CoreBrand)===

CoreBrand – a research, brand strategy, communication, and design firm – utilizes the Brand Contribution to Market Cap method using the Corporate Branding Index® database composed of Familiarity and Favorability data as the quantitative basis of its system.

Familiarity and Favorability scores are analyzed in the context of a company&#x27;s size in market cap and revenue to determine a base expected level of Familiarity and Favorability for the brand&#x27;s value to be zero. Utilizing a statistical regression analysis of the factors driving the cash flow multiple and thus share price, the variance in Familiarity and Favorability above or below the base expected level is analyzed.&lt;br&gt;
As a point in time analysis, this method is used for brand equity valuation of a company based on its current Familiarity and Favorability, Revenue and Market Cap. The output of the analysis provides the end user with two pieces of data:
# The percentage of market cap that is attributable directly to its corporate brand (i.e., how hard the brand is working to create value for the company);
# The dollar value of the brand at a point in time, this is the asset value of the brand as a component of the company&#x27;s market valuation.
According to this analysis, the corporate brand is responsible for 5-7% of stock performance on average.

===Conjoint Analysis===

Marketers use conjoint analysis to measure consumers&#x27; preference for various attributes of a product, service, or provider, such as features, design, price, or location. By including brand and price as two of the attributes under consideration, they can gain insight into consumers&#x27; valuation of a brand—that is, their willingness to pay a premium for it.

Note: These customer satisfaction methodologies have not been independently validated by the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) according to MMAP (Marketing Metric Audit Protocol).

===Brand Equity with Time-Series Data (Event Study)===

While event study offer evidence that brand equity positively affects financial performance, many studies focus on customer mindset metrics to offer this relationship (Berger, Eechambadi, George, Lehmann, Rizley &amp; Venkatesan, 2006; Buil, Martinez &amp; de Chernatony, 2013).

Event method is applied to determine the stakeholder interest or value assessed in a brand before, during or after an event. As exemplified by Agrawal &amp; Kamakura&#x27;s (1995) research, the economic worth of celebrity endorsers, the authors demonstrate that an announcement of brand association of a product and celebrity creates a movement in stock value; whereby, shareholder interest is influenced by the endorsement as evidenced from the time-series data.

A similar time-series data analysis offered by Lane &amp; Jacobson (1995) also measured stock market reactions to announcements associated with a particular brand, which factored customer attitudes and the familiarity of the brand to determine financial outcomes. The result was that the stock market response was favorable to brand announcements when consumers were familiar with the brand and held the brand in high esteem. The same applied to low familiarity and low esteem brands, which as Keller (2002) explains, was &quot;because there was little to risk and much to gain …&quot;(p. 157).

Other researchers examine the antecedents of brand equity or brand value. For instance, Roy &amp; Cornwell (2003) showed that lesser known brands may benefit from event sponsorships as a brand-building exercise but customers may have associations with the event sponsors or brand associations that could determine affective attitudes. Ultimately, high equity counterparts will yield stronger results due to their market familiarity.

Simon &amp; Sullivan (1993) suggested long-term analysis of events, as determined by financial returns and market performance, better captures the effect of customer mindset brand equity. In the restaurant sector, for example, returns of branding are contemporaneous. The high-tech sector showed no contemporaneous effects and brand equity is realized in the future with significant delay. The distribution/retail sector included both contemporaneous and positive future profitability. Berger et al., (2006) acknowledge the long-term approach for considering customer lifetime value relevant to the shareholder value or financial performance of a brand. This perspective contributed to concepts like &quot;brand awareness&quot;, which Huang &amp; Sarigöllü (2012) apply to the commonly used marketing metrics to determine stock market performance.

== Managing brand equity ==
One of the challenges in managing brands is the many changes that occur in the marketing environment. The marketing environment evolves and changes, often in very significant ways. Shifts in consumer behavior, competitive strategies, government regulations, and other aspects of the marketing environment can profoundly affect the fortunes of a brand. Besides these external forces, the firm itself may engage in a variety of activities and changes in strategic focus or direction that may necessitate adjustments in the way that its brands are being marketed. Consequently, effective brand management requires proactive strategies designed to at least maintain – if not actually enhance – brand equity in the face of these different forces.

=== Brand reinforcement ===

As a company&#x27;s major enduring asset, a brand needs to be carefully managed so its value does not depreciate. Marketers can reinforce brand equity by consistently conveying the brand&#x27;s meaning in terms of

(1) what product it represents, what core benefits it supplies, and what needs it satisfies

(2) how the brand makes the product superior and which strong, favorable, and unique brand associations should exist in consumers&#x27; minds.

Both of these issues – brand meaning in terms of products, benefits, and needs as well as brand meaning in terms of product differentiation – depend on the firm&#x27;s general approach to product development, branding strategies, and other strategic concerns.

=== Brand re-genesis ===

Any new development in the marketing environment can affect a brand&#x27;s fortune. Nevertheless, a number of brands have managed to make impressive comebacks in recent years. Often, the first thing to do in revitalizing a brand is to understand what the sources of brand equity were to begin with. Are positive associations losing their strength or uniqueness? Have negative associations become linked to the brand? Then decide whether to retain the same positioning or create a new one, and if so, which new one.

=== Maintaining brand consistency ===

Without question, the most important consideration in reinforcing brands is the consistency of the marketing support that the brand receives – both in terms of the amount and nature of marketing support. Brand consistency is critical to maintaining the strength and favorability of brand associations. Brands that receive inadequate support, in terms of such things as shrinking research and development or marketing communication budgets, run the risk of becoming technologically disadvantaged or even obsolete. Consistency does not mean, however, that marketers should avoid making any changes in the marketing program. On the contrary, the opposite can be quite true – being consistent in managing brand equity may require numerous tactical shifts and changes in order to maintain the proper strategic thrust and direction of the brand. There are many ways that brand awareness and brand image can be created, maintained, or improved through carefully designed marketing programs. The tactics that may be most effective for a particular brand at any one time can certainly vary from those that may be most effective for the brand at another time. As a consequence, prices may move up or down, product features may be added or dropped, ad campaigns may employ different creative strategies and slogans, and different brand extensions may be introduced or withdrawn over time in order to create the same desired knowledge structures in consumers&#x27; minds.

<doc id="240384" wikidata="Q1268075" url="?curid=240384" title="The French Lieutenant's Woman">
<text>The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman is a 1969 postmodern historical fiction novel by John Fowles. The plot explores the fraught relationship of gentleman and amateur naturalist Charles Smithson and Sarah Woodruff, the former governess and independent woman with whom he falls in love. The novel builds on Fowles&#x27;s authority in Victorian literature, both following and critiquing many of the conventions of period novels.

The book was the author&#x27;s third, after &quot;The Collector&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Magus&quot; (1965). &quot;American Libraries&quot; magazine counted the novel among the &quot;Notable Books of 1969&quot;. Subsequent to its initial popularity, publishers produced numerous editions and translated the novel into many languages; soon after the initial publication, the novel was also treated extensively by scholars. The novel remains popular, figuring in both public and academic conversations. In 2005 &quot;Time&quot; chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels since the magazine began publication in 1923.

Part of the novel&#x27;s reputation concerns its postmodern literary qualities, with expressions of metafiction, historiography, , Marxist criticism, and feminism. Stylistically and thematically, the novel has been described as historiographic metafiction. The contrast between the independent Sarah Woodruff and the more stereotypical male characters often earns the novel attention for its treatment of gender issues. 

The novel was adapted into a film in 1981, with script by the playwright Harold Pinter, directed by Karel Reisz, starring Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons. The film received considerable critical acclaim, including several BAFTA and Golden Globe awards.

==Background==
Before Fowles published &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; in 1969, he had already established his literary reputation with the novels &quot;The Collector&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Magus&quot; (1965). While writing &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;, he was working on the screenplay for the film adaptation of &quot;The Magus&quot; (1968). Moreover, &quot;The Collector&quot; had already been adapted into a 1965 film which had gained Fowles further popular attention.

Fowles described his main inspiration for &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; to be a persistent image of a &quot;Victorian Woman&quot;, who later developed into the novel&#x27;s titular character Sarah Woodruff. In the 1969 essay &quot;Notes on an Unfinished Novel&quot;, Fowles reflected on his writing process. He said he had an image during the autumn of 1966 of: &quot;A woman [who] stands at the end of a deserted quay and stares out to sea.&quot; He determined that she belonged to a &quot;Victorian Age&quot; and had &quot;mysterious&quot; and &quot;vaguely romantic&quot; qualities. He made a note at the time about the function of the novel:
 In an appended comment, dated &quot;October 27, 1967&quot;, he writes that he finished the first draft of the novel at about 140,000 words.

Throughout the essay, Fowles describes multiple influences and issues important to the novel&#x27;s development, including his debt to other authors such as Thomas Hardy. In the essay, he describes surprise that the female character Sarah had taken the primary role in the novel. Later, Fowles described other influences shaping the characters’ development, noting that the characters and story of &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; were loosely derived from the Claire de Duras novel &quot;Ourika&quot; (1823), which features a tragic affair between an African woman and French military man. Fowles later published a 1977 translation of &quot;Ourika&quot; into English.

==Plot summary==

Set in the mid-nineteenth century, the narrator identifies the novel&#x27;s protagonist as Sarah Woodruff, the &quot;Woman&quot; of the title, also known as &quot;Tragedy&quot; and as &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Whore&quot;. She lives in the coastal town of Lyme Regis as a disgraced woman, supposedly abandoned by a French ship&#x27;s officer named Varguennes who had returned to France and married. Employed as a servant in the household of the very pious Mrs. Poulteney, she spends some of her limited free time on The Cobb, a stone jetty where she stares out to sea.

One day, Charles Smithson, an orphaned gentleman, and Ernestina Freeman, his fiancée and a daughter of a wealthy tradesman, see Sarah walking along the cliffside. Ernestina tells Charles something of Sarah&#x27;s story, and he becomes curious about her. Though continuing to court Ernestina, Charles has several more encounters with Sarah, meeting her clandestinely three times. During these meetings, Sarah tells Charles of her history, and asks for his emotional and social support. During the same period, he learns of the possible loss of his place as heir to his elderly uncle, who has become engaged to a woman young enough to bear a child. Meanwhile, Charles&#x27;s servant Sam falls in love with Mary, the maid of Ernestina&#x27;s aunt.

In fact, Charles has fallen in love with Sarah and advises her to leave Lyme for Exeter. Returning from a journey to warn Ernestina&#x27;s father about his uncertain inheritance, Charles stops in Exeter as if to visit Sarah. From there, the narrator, who intervenes throughout the novel and later becomes a character in it, offers three different ways in which the novel could end:

* First ending: Charles does not visit Sarah, but immediately returns to Lyme to reaffirm his love for Ernestina. They marry, though the marriage never becomes particularly happy, and Charles enters trade under Ernestina&#x27;s father, Mr. Freeman. The narrator pointedly notes the lack of knowledge about Sarah&#x27;s fate. Charles tells Ernestina about an encounter which he implies is with the &quot;French Lieutenant&#x27;s Whore&quot;, but elides the sordid details, and the matter is ended. The narrator dismisses this ending as a daydream by Charles, before the alternative events of the subsequent meeting with Ernestina are described. Critic Michelle Phillips Buchberger describes this first ending as &quot;a semblance of verisimilitude in the traditional &#x27;happy ending&#x27;&quot; found in actual Victorian novels.

Before the second and third endings, the narrator appears as a character sharing a railway compartment with Charles. He tosses a coin to determine the order in which he will portray the other two possible endings, emphasising their equal plausibility. They are as follows:

* Second ending: Charles and Sarah have a rash sexual encounter in which Charles realises that Sarah was a virgin. Reflecting on his emotions during this, Charles ends his engagement to Ernestina, and proposes to Sarah through a letter. Charles&#x27;s servant Sam fails to deliver the letter and, after Charles breaks his engagement, Ernestina&#x27;s father disgraces him. His uncle marries and his wife bears an heir, ensuring the loss of the expected inheritance. To escape the social suicide and depression caused by his broken engagement, Charles goes abroad to Europe and America. Ignorant of Charles&#x27; proposal, Sarah flees to London without telling her lover. During Charles&#x27; trips abroad, his lawyer searches for Sarah, finding her two years later living in the Chelsea house of the painter and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti at 16 Cheyne Walk, where she enjoys an artistic, creative life. Sarah shows Charles the child of their affair, leaving him in hope that the three may be reunited.
* Third ending: The narrator re-appears outside the Cheyne Walk house and turns back his pocket watch by fifteen minutes. Events are the same as in the second-ending version until Charles meets Sarah, when their reunion is sour. The new ending does not make clear the parentage of the child and Sarah expresses no interest in reviving the relationship. Charles leaves the house, intending to return to the United States, wondering whether Sarah is a manipulative, lying woman who exploited him.

==Characters==
*The Narrator – as in other works of metafiction, the narrator&#x27;s voice frequently intervenes in the story with a personality of its own. Though the voice appears to be that of Fowles, Magali Cornier Michael notes that chapter 13, which discusses the role of author and narrator within fiction, distinguishes between the author&#x27;s role in the text and the narrator&#x27;s. Alice Ferrebe describes the narrator as both a lens for critiquing traditional gender roles and a perpetuation of the perspectives on gendered identity perpetuated by the male gaze.
*Sarah Woodruff – the main protagonist according to the narrator. Formerly a governess, she becomes disgraced after an illicit, but unconsummated, liaison with an injured French naval lieutenant, who washed ashore. The feminist critic Magali Cornier Michael argues that she is more a plot device, not interpretable as a main character because her thoughts and motivations are only interpreted from the perspective of outside male characters. Sarah offers a representation of myth or symbol within a male perspective on women. 
*Charles Smithson – the main male character. Though born into a family with close ties to nobility, Smithson does not possess a title but has a sizable income and considerable education. Early in the novel he is described both as a casual naturalist and a Darwinist. Though trying to become an enlightened and forward-thinking individual, the narrator often emphasises, through commentary on Smithson&#x27;s actions and situation, that his identity is strongly rooted in the traditional social system. Moreover, conflicting identification with social forces, such as science and religion, lead Smithson to an existential crisis.
*Ernestina Freeman – Smithson&#x27;s fiancée and daughter to a London-based owner of department stores. Unlike Sarah, Ernestina&#x27;s temperament is much less complex, and much more simple-minded. 
*Sam Farrow – Charles&#x27;s Hackney servant with aspirations to become a haberdasher. Throughout the novel, Sam becomes the narrator&#x27;s model for the working class peoples of Victorian Britain, comparing Sam&#x27;s identity with Charles&#x27;s ignorance of that culture. According to critic David Landrum, the tension between Sam and Charles Smithson importantly demonstrates Marxist class struggle, though this aspect of the novel is often overlooked by criticism emphasizing Charles&#x27;s relationship to Sarah. 
*Dr Grogan – an Irish doctor in the town of Lyme Regis who both advises the various upper-class families in the town, and becomes an adviser to Charles. His education and interest in Darwin and other education make him a good companion for Charles.
*Mr Freeman – the father of Ernestina, he earned his wealth as an owner of a drapery and clothes sales chain of stores. He &quot;represents the rising entrepreneurial class in England&quot; which stands in stark contrast to the old money which Smithson comes from.
*Mrs Tranter – a prominent member of Lyme Regis society who is friends with Grogan and, as her maternal aunt, hosts Ernestina during her stay.
*Mrs Poulteney – a wealthy widow and, at the beginning of the novel, the employer of Sarah Woodruff. Hypocritical, and hypersensitive, her character fulfills the archetype of high-society villainess.
*Mary – stereotypical lower-class servant to Mrs Tranter and future wife to Sam Farrow.
*Montague - Charles Smithson&#x27;s family lawyer of a firm which has been around since the eighteenth century. 2–3 years older than Charles, he helps his client in search of Sarah towards the end of the novel.

==Style and structure==
Like many other postmodern novels, Fowles uses multiple different stylistic and structural techniques to highlight his thematic interests in &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;. When discussing these stylistic concerns, many literary critics comment on the importance of the narrator and the narration, the intertextual references to other literary works, and the multiple endings.

===Narration ===
Throughout the novel, the omniscient narrative voice, alongside a series of footnotes, reflect with an objective tone on a number of plot devices: the author&#x27;s difficulty controlling the characters; the conventions that are expected of a &quot;Victorian novel&quot;; and analyses of differences in 19th-century customs and class. The narrator often returns to topics of interest to literature and scholarship from the period, like the theories of Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell, the radical politics of Karl Marx, and the works of Matthew Arnold, Alfred Tennyson and Thomas Hardy.

Through a metafictional and voice, the contemporary, postmodern narrator questions the role of the author and the historian in thinking about the past. In her article discussing the use of paratext, or the contextualizing text printed in the book such as the footnotes and epigraphs, Deborah Bowen argues that the novel&#x27;s paratext forces the reader, as in other postmodern works, to rethink the importance of such peripheral material that in other contexts will get overlooked in light of preference for the main text. Instead of nicely complementing the main plot and adding meaning, these paratextual elements can distract from the effectiveness of the novel and challenge the authority of the narrative voice.

===Intertextuality===
Beyond the narrator intervening and emphasizing particular interpretations of the text, the book&#x27;s metafictional approach often relies on intertextual references to provide further commentary. In the epigraphs for each chapter, the book gestures towards a number of important 19th-century texts and ideas. Partially, references to other texts act in &quot;ironic play&quot;, parodied by how the novel emulates other Victorian conventions throughout the text. Linda Hutcheon describes the works of William Thackeray, George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Froude, and Thomas Hardy as direct inspirations for this parody.

In his discussion of science and religion in the novel, John Glendening notes that both character commentary on Darwin&#x27;s publications along with the epigraphs mentioning those works as direct contributors to the novel&#x27;s emphasis on science superseding religion. Similarly, by quoting Marx with the first epigraph, along with multiple subsequent epigraphs, the novel directs thematic attention towards the socio-economics issues within the novel. Deborah Bowen describes literary critics struggling to find readings of the epigraphs that explore the themes of the novel, and argues that the poor relationship between the epigraphs and the text &quot;disperses the authority of the narrative voice, thus destroying his power to speak as a moralist.&quot; For Bowen, the epigraphs support the satire of Victorian fiction conventions in the novel.

===Multiple endings===
Often critics will comment on the novel&#x27;s multiple endings. Each offers a possible ending for Charles&#x27;s pursuit of Sarah: the first ends with Charles married to Ernestina, the second with a successful reestablishment of a relationship with Sarah, and the third with Charles cast back into the world without a partner. Michelle Phillips Buchberger discusses these endings as a demonstration of &quot;Fowles&#x27;s rejection of a narrow mimesis&quot; of reality; rather Fowles presents this multiplicity of endings to highlight the role of the author in plot choices.

It is not enough to suggest that the novel with its multiple endings is a mere experiment with the narrative form. &quot;There is something more in it,&quot; as Mandal puts it, &quot;an impasse that resists any straight forward resolution to the story.&quot; After all, the form of a narrative is determined by its content. It is Sarah Woodruff &quot;the content of whose character produces multiple and contradictory possibilities&quot; for the narrative.

==Themes==
Though a bestseller, the novel has also received significant scrutiny by literary critics. Especially during the 1960s and 70s, a novel with great popularity and significant academic scrutiny is unusual; in literary study, the canon and its academic defenders often focused on &quot;high literary&quot; works that didn&#x27;t have large popular followings. In her study of postmodernism, Linda Hutcheon described &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;&#x27;s binary of popular and academic interest as a paradox similar to the postmodern thematic binaries produced within the novel&#x27;s content. Because of its prominence since publication, the novel has received a variety of different academic re-examinations in light of numerous critical and thematic approaches. Some of the most popular concerns for the novel are its discussion of gender, especially questioning claims by Fowles that it is a feminist novel, its engagement with metafictional and concepts, and its treatment of science and religion.

===Gender===
The novel creates a number of binaries between men and women. Michelle Phillips Buchberger argues that &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;, along with &quot;The Collector&quot; and &quot;The Magus&quot;, portrays a fundamental binary between the male and female characters: the female characters act as an elite set of &quot;creators&quot; or &quot;educated, visionary, and predominantly female&quot; characters who provide the facilitation for evolution &quot;in existential terms&quot; of the male &quot;&#x27;collectors&#x27;, whose traits are present in all of Fowles&#x27;s flawed male protagonists.&quot; Though acknowledging such binaries in the role of the characters, critic Alice Ferrebe does not treat these binaries as necessary thematic elements. Rather, the binaries demonstrate what she calls a gendered &quot;scopic politics&quot;, or a politics created by a gaze (not dissimilar from the &quot;male gaze&quot; noticed in cinema studies), that constructs an artificial gender binary within Fowles&#x27;s early novels (as opposed to a multiplicity of socially constructed genders). For Ferrebe, this binary creates a tension, especially with Sarah, who becomes a violently fetishised and objectified &quot;other&quot;, differentiated from the male characters like Charles.

====Feminist novel====
A number of critics have treated the work as a feminist novel, while others have debated whether it offers a sufficiently transformative perspective on women. The novel&#x27;s narrator demonstrates and proclaims a feminist approach to women: Sarah is presented as a more liberated and independently willed woman as compared to the other model female characters, such as Ernestina and her aunt. In a 1985 interview by Jan Relf, Fowles declared himself a &quot;feminist&quot;.

Magali Cornier Michael criticises this reading of the text, saying that the novel&#x27;s overwhelming reliance on male perspectives on women and feminism prevents the novel from meeting feminist objectives. Similarly, Michelle Phillips Buchberger argues that &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman,&quot; along with Fowles&#x27;s two earlier novels &quot;The Collector&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Magus&quot; (1965), proclaimed a &quot;pseudo-feminism&quot; while advocating some feminist ideas; but, she says, they are permeated by a &quot;fetishism [of women that] perpetuates the idea of woman as &#x27;other&#x27;&quot;. Alice Ferrebe also notes that, despite Fowles&#x27;s attempts to critique masculine values, his novels remain male fantasies demonstrative of the &quot;compromises and contradictions&quot; created by the gendered situation in which he was writing. Other literary critics, such as William Palmer, Peter Conradi, Bruce Woodcock and Pamela Cooper, have also critiqued Fowles&#x27;s claims to a feminist perspective and representation.

Fowles&#x27;s presentation of Sarah, one of the most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women. The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah&#x27;s deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.

===Metafiction, historiography and metahistory===
In her important study of postmodernity and its poetics in literature, Linda Hucheon describes this novel as definitive of a genre she calls &quot;historiographic metafiction&quot;. She defines this postmodern genre as &quot;well-known and popular novels which are both intensely self-reflexive yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages.&quot; Typically postmodern, this genre of fiction blends the creation of imagined narratives with critique on the various modes in which we create knowledge, such as history and literature. Important to her discussion of the genre&#x27;s post-modern style, &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;&#x27;s self-reflexive narration bridges different discourses that usually remain separated, such as academic history, literary criticism, philosophy and literature.

The text&#x27;s representations of the past introduce anachronistic perspectives on the time and the characters. For example, in her queer studies-based article, &quot;Historical Romance, Gender and Heterosexuality&quot;, Lisa Fletcher argues that &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;, by relying on a &quot;good love story&quot; as the central means of representing the past, projects a contemporary hetero-normative sexuality on the history of Victorian England. For Fletcher, Fowles&#x27;s paradoxical treatment of Sarah as both a Victorian character and as a desirable &quot;modern woman,&quot; through feminist gestures and sexual tension between Charles and Sarah, confines the historical set characters and their experience to stereotypical heterosexual romance. Fletcher believes that overall the text creates a stereotypical and limited perspective on the past, essentially &quot;heterosexualising the passage of (and relationship to) history&quot;.

===Science and religion===

Emphasis on a conflicted relationship between science and religion frequently occurs in both historical studies of Victorian history and Neo-Victorian novels. In his chapter on &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; in his book, &quot;Evolution and the Uncrucified Jesus&quot;, John Glendening argues that Fowles&#x27;s novel is one of the first neo-Victorian novels to handle the dynamic created between science and religion in Victorian identity. Glendening notes that more generally &quot;Christian ideas and conventions become appropriated in the service of a secularist and extensional version of truth.&quot;

Glendening says that Fowles uses commentary on Darwinism &quot;to comment on characters and their experience and to forward a view of natural and human reality opposed to Christian doctrine, and, within limits amenable to existentialist philosophy. &quot; In general, Glendening sees ideas of science and religion as central to the personal and social identities that develop within the novel, but creating symbolically conflictual binaries. He suggests that Fowles manoeuvres these conflictual forces to favour an existential self-revelation exhibited through the main character of Smithson, leading to a conclusion that &quot;the freedom implicit in accepting alienation should be exercised in overcoming it.&quot;

==Contemporary reception==
The novel received mixed critical attention at its initial publication. Critics focused both praise and critique on its style, plot and approach to metafiction and metahistory. The following samples those responses:

&quot;The New York Times&quot; November 1969 review by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt warned readers to &quot;be certain there&#x27;s only one log on the fire. If, unhappily, you lack the fireplace by which this book should be read, set an alarm clock.&quot; Lehmann-Haupt found the book to begin as &quot;irresistibly novelistic that he has disguised it as a Victorian romance,&quot; yet the metafictional construction by the end positively &quot;explodes all the assumptions of our Victorian sensibilities.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s November 1969 review described the novel as &quot;resourceful and penetrating talent at work on that archaic form.&quot; In March 1970, the magazine &quot;American Libraries&quot; named the novel as one of the &quot;Notable Books of 1969,&quot; calling it &quot;A successful blending of two worlds as the author writes in modern terminology of the Victorian era.&quot;

Not all of the reviews were positive; for example, Roger Sale in &quot;The Hudson Review&quot; largely criticized the novel, saying, &quot;At times it seems that the commentary is not so bad and the novel awful, but at others Fowles makes the novel almost work and the comments are embarrassingly vulgar.&quot; Ultimately, the reviewer concluded that the novel was &quot;stumbling and gauche and much much too long, but curiously attractive too.&quot;

==Publication history==
The novel has been reprinted in numerous editions and translated into many languages: Taiwanese, Danish, Dutch, Arabic, Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Chinese, German, Russian, Polish, and Spanish. The novel was originally published in 1969 by Little Brown and Company in both Boston and Toronto.

==Legacy==
The general popularity of &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; has inspired several responses to the novel, most notably other authors&#x27; work and adaptation into film and theatre.

===Literary response===

The most prominent response to the novel is A. S. Byatt&#x27;s 1990 Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;Possession&quot;. She describes her novel as deliberately responding to the model of postmodern metafiction that critics highlight in &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;. Byatt described her motivation for responding in her essays in &quot;On Histories and Stories&quot;, saying:
===Adaptation===
The novel was adapted as a 1981 film, written by playwright Harold Pinter and directed by Karel Reisz. The film starred Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay for Pinter. Pinter was nominated for a Golden Globe for best script and the work as a whole in the category Best Motion Picture – Drama.

During 2006, a stage version by Mark Healy toured the UK. Also in 2006, BBC Radio 4 produced an adaptation of two one-hour episodes, starring John Hurt as the narrator.

<doc id="240388" wikidata="Q660304" url="?curid=240388" title="Pacific Coast Ranges">
<text>The Pacific Coast Ranges (officially gazetted as the Pacific Mountain System in the United States; ; ) are the series of mountain ranges that stretch along the West Coast of North America from Alaska south to Northern and Central Mexico. Although they are commonly thought to be the westernmost mountain range of the continental United States and Canada, the geologically distinct Insular Mountains of Vancouver Island lie farther west.

The Pacific Coast Ranges are part of the North American Cordillera (sometimes known as the Western Cordillera, or in Canada, as the Pacific Cordillera and/or the Canadian Cordillera), which includes the Rocky Mountains, the Columbia Mountains, the Interior Mountains, the Interior Plateau, the Sierra Nevada, the Great Basin mountain ranges, and other ranges and various plateaus and basins.

The Pacific Coast Ranges designation, however, only applies to the Western System of the Western Cordillera, which comprises the Saint Elias Mountains, Coast Mountains, Insular Mountains, Olympic Mountains, Cascade Range, Oregon Coast Range, California Coast Ranges, Transverse Ranges, Peninsular Ranges, and the Sierra Madre Occidental.

==Other uses==
The term &quot;Coast Range&quot; is used by the United States Geological Survey to refer only to the ranges south of the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Washington to the California-Mexico border, and to those west of Puget Sound, the Willamette Valley, and the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys (the California Central Valley).
That definition excludes the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges, the Mojave &quot;(High)&quot;, and Sonoran &quot;(Low)&quot; Deserts, i.e. the Pacific Border province. The same term is used informally in Canada to refer to the Coast Mountains and adjoining inland ranges such as the Hazelton Mountains, and sometimes also the Saint Elias Mountains.

==Geography==
The character of the ranges varies considerably, from the record-setting tidewater glaciers in the ranges of Alaska, to the rugged Central and Southern California ranges, the Transverse Ranges and Peninsular Ranges, in the chaparral and woodlands eco-region with Oak Woodland, Chaparral shrub forest or Coastal sage scrub-covering them. The coastline is often seen dropping steeply into the sea with photogenic views. Along the British Columbia and Alaska coast, the mountains intermix with the sea in a complex maze of fjords, with thousands of islands. Off the Southern California coast the Channel Islands archipelago of the Santa Monica Mountains extends for .

There are coastal plains at the mouths of rivers that have punched through the mountains spreading sediments, most notably at the Copper River in Alaska, the Fraser River in British Columbia, and the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon. In California: the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers&#x27; San Francisco Bay, the Santa Clara River&#x27;s Oxnard Plain, the Los Angeles, San Gabriel, and Santa Ana Rivers&#x27; Los Angeles Basina coastal sediment-filled plain between the peninsular and transverse ranges with sediment in the basin up to 6 miles (10 km) deep, and the San Diego River&#x27;s Mission Bay.

From the vicinity of San Francisco Bay north, it is common in winter for cool unstable air masses from the Gulf of Alaska to make landfall in one of the Coast Ranges, resulting in heavy precipitation, both as rain and snow, especially on their western slopes. The same Winter weather occurs with less frequency and precipitation in Southern California, with the mountains&#x27; western faces and peaks causing an eastward rainshadow that produces the arid desert regions.

Omitted from the list below, but often included is the Sierra Nevada, a major mountain range of eastern California that is separated by the Central Valley over much of its length from the California Coast Ranges and the Transverse Ranges.

==Geology==
On the West coast of North America, the coast ranges and the coastal plain form the margin. Most of the land is made of terranes that have been accreted onto the margin. In the north, the insular belt is an accreted terrane, forming the margin. This belt extends from the Wrangellia Terrane in Alaska to the Chilliwack group of Canada.

A rupture in Rodinia 750 million years ago formed a passive margin in the eastern Pacific Northwest. The breakup of Pangea 200 million years ago began the westward movement of the North American plate, creating an active margin on the western continent. As the continent drifted West, terranes were accreted onto the west coast. The timing of the accretion of the insular belt is uncertain, although the closure did not occur until at least 115 million years ago. Other Mesozoic terranes that accreted onto the continent include the Klamath Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Guerrero super-terrane of western Mexico. 90–80 million years ago the subducting Farallon plate split and formed the Kula Plate to the North. This formed an area in what is now Northern California, where the plates converged forming a Mélange. North of this was the Columbia Embayment, where the continental margin was east of the surrounding areas. Many of the major batholiths date from the late Cretaceous. As the Laramide Orogeny ended around 48 million years ago, the accretion of the Siletzia terrane began in the Pacific Northwest. This began the volcanic activity in the Cascadia subduction zone, forming the modern Cascade Range, and lasted into the Miocene. Events here may relate to the ignimbrite flare-up of the southern Basin and Range. As extension in the Basin and Range Province slowed by a change in North American Plate movement circa 7 to 8 Million years ago, rifting began on the Gulf of California.

Although many of the ranges do share a common geologic history, the Pacific Coast Ranges province is not defined by geology, but rather by geography. Many of the various ranges are composed of distinct forms of rock from many different periods of geological time from the Precambrian in parts of the Little San Bernardino Mountains to 10,000-year-old rock in the Cascade Range. For one example, the Peninsular Ranges, composed of Mesozoic batholitic rock, are geologically extremely different from the San Bernardino Mountains, composed of a mix of Precambrian metamorphic rock and Cenozoic sedimentary rock. However, both are considered part of the Pacific Coast Ranges due to their proximity and similar economic and social impact on surrounding communities.

<text>Fernando Alonso Díaz (; born 29 July 1981) is a Spanish racing driver, who competes in Formula One for Aston Martin. Alonso has won two Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles, which he won in and with Renault, and has won Grands Prix across 21 seasons. In endurance racing, Alonso won the 2018–19 FIA World Endurance Championship and is a two-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Toyota, and remains the only driver to have won both the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship and the World Sportscar/World Endurance Drivers&#x27; Championship; he also won the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2019 with WTR.

Born in Oviedo, Asturias to a working-class family, Alonso began kart racing aged three and achieved success in local, national, and world championships. He progressed to junior formulae aged 17, winning the Euro Open by Nissan in 1999 and was fourth in the International Formula 3000 Championship of 2000. He debuted in Formula One with Minardi in before joining Renault as a test driver for . Promoted to a race seat in , Alonso won two drivers&#x27; championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest pole-sitter, youngest race winner, youngest world champion, and youngest two-time champion in the sport&#x27;s history at the time. After finishing just one point behind eventual champion Kimi Räikkönen with McLaren in , he returned to Renault for and and won two races in the former year for fifth overall. Alonso drove for Ferrari from to , finishing runner-up to Sebastian Vettel in 2010, , and with the title battles in 2010 and 2012 going down to the last race of the season. 

A second stint with McLaren (this time with Honda engines) from to resulted in no further success. Alonso retired from Formula One at the end of 2018, but would return to the sport in with the newly organized Alpine F1 Team. At the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix, Alonso scored his first podium in seven years. At the 2022 Singapore Grand Prix, he broke the record for most starts in Formula One. Alonso moved to Aston Martin for the 2023 season, where he saw great success at the beginning of the season, with six podium finishes in the first eight races. At the 2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Alonso scored his 100th podium by finishing third, becoming one of six drivers in the series&#x27; history to achieve that feat. At the 2024 Qatar Grand Prix, he set another milestone by competing in his 400th Formula One race, becoming the first driver ever to do so.

As of the , Alonso has achieved race wins, pole positions, fastest laps and podiums in Formula One. Alonso is contracted to remain at Aston Martin until at least the end of the 2026 season. Alonso won the 2001 Race of Champions Nations Cup with the rally driver Jesús Puras and the motorcyclist Rubén Xaus for Team Spain and thrice entered the Indianapolis 500 in 2017, 2019 and 2020. He has been awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Sports, the Premios Nacionales del Deporte Sportsman of the Year Award and the Gold Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit and has twice been inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame. Alonso runs an esports and junior racing team and is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.

==Early life and karting career==
Alonso was born on 29 July 1981 to a working-class family in Oviedo, Asturias, Northern Spain. He is the son of the mine shaft explosives factory mechanic and amateur kart driver José Luis Alonso, and his wife, the department store employee Ana Díaz. Alonso has an elder sister, Lorena, who is a doctor.

He was educated at the Holy Guardian Angel Primary School (&quot;Spanish&quot;: Santo Ángel de la Guarda) in Oviedo from 1985 to 1995 under the Basic Education System (&quot;Spanish&quot;: Educación General Básica). Alonso attended the Institute Leopoldo Alas Clarín of San Lazaro (&quot;Spanish&quot;: Instituto Leopoldo Alas Clarín de San Lázaro) until his career in motor racing caused him to leave during his Curso de Orientación Universitaria (&quot;English&quot;: University Orientation Course) in 2000. He was granted a permit to study away from school, after he disobeyed his mother&#x27;s orders and seldom attended classes. He achieved a good academic performance by asking his classmates for notes and was unproblematic.
Alonso&#x27;s father wanted a hobby to share with his children and built a go-kart for Lorena. She was uninterested in karting and a three-year-old Alonso received the kart. The kart&#x27;s pedals were modified for drive-ability, and the local racing federation granted him a mandatory kart racing license aged five; his father rejected an offer for his son to be a goalkeeper for the RC Celta de Vigo football club. The family lacked the finances required to develop him in karts; they could not purchase rain tyres and forced Alonso to adapt to a wet track on slick tyres. Alonso devised three timing sectors going to school to improve himself daily. His mother sewed his racing overalls and adjusted them as he grew; she also ensured Alonso was academically well off. His father steered the kart early on and was his accountant, counsellor, manager and mechanic.

Aged seven, Alonso won his first kart race in Pola de Laviana. He won the 1988 and 1989 children&#x27;s junior Championship of the Asturias and Galicia, and progressed to the Cadet class in 1990. Go-kart importer Genís Marcó was impressed by Alonso and mentored him; kart track owner José Luis Echevarria told him about Alonso. Marcó found personal and sponsorship money for Alonso&#x27;s family to defray financial concerns and allow him to enter European series. He spoke to the six-time Karting World Champion Mike Wilson, who gave Alonso a test session at a track in Parma. Marcó taught Alonso to be conservative and maintain the condition of a kart.

Alonso won the 1990 Asturias and the Basque Country Cadet Championship and finished second in the 1991 Spanish Cadet National Championship. The local karting federation allowed him to enter the 100cc class because he was deemed underage to drive more powerful machinery. At a Catalan Karting Championship meet in Móra d&#x27;Ebre, Marcó asked Alonso if he wanted to enter the Spanish Karting Championship. Wilson mentored Alonso; he joined the Italian American Motor Engineering works team in 1993. Alonso won three successive Spanish Junior National Championships from 1993 to 1995.

The results allowed him to progress to the world championships. Alonso was third at the 1995 Commission Internationale de Karting (CIK-FIA) Cadets&#x27; Rainbow Trophy. Alonso was a mechanic to younger kart drivers to earn money. He won his fourth Spanish Junior Karting Championship, the Trofeo Estival, the Marlboro Masters, and the CIK-FIA 5 Continents Juniors Cup at the Karting Genk in 1996. In 1997, he took the Italian and Spanish International A championships and was second in the European Championship with nine wins, the Masters Karting Paris Bercy and the Spanish Karting Championship.

==Motor racing career==
=== Junior racing career ===

Aged 17, Alonso made his car racing debut in the 1999 Euro Open by Nissan with Campos Motorsport, winning the title from Manuel Gião at the final race of the season with six wins and nine pole positions. For 2000, he progressed to the higher-tier International Formula 3000 Championship with the Minardi-backed Team Astromega, after a sponsorship agreement with driver Robert Lechner fell through. Alonso finished second at the Hungaroring and won the season-ending round at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps for fourth overall with 17 points.

===Formula One===
==== Minardi and Renault (2001–2006) ====
Cesare Fiorio, the sports director, gave Alonso a test in a Formula One (F1) car at the Circuito de Jerez in December 1999, as part of the Euro Open by Nissan&#x27;s organising company RPM&#x27;s agreement to give its series champion an opportunity to test at a higher level. He was Minardi&#x27;s test and reserve driver in before joining its race team in . In a non-competitive car, Alonso&#x27;s best result of the season was a tenth-place finish in the and scored no points for 23rd overall.
He signed as Renault&#x27;s test driver for per the orders of manager Flavio Briatore to familiarise himself with the team and improve himself for the future. Alonso worked with the engineering department to improve Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s and Jenson Button&#x27;s performance, and tested in Spain and the United Kingdom. He drove a Jaguar in an evaluation session against test drivers André Lotterer and James Courtney at the Silverstone Circuit in May 2002. Alonso was promoted to the Renault race team for . He went on to break the records of youngest driver to win a pole position at the season&#x27;s second race, the , and broke Bruce McLaren&#x27;s record as the youngest F1 race winner at the later in the year. He achieved four podium finishes in 2003 and was sixth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 55 points.

He remained with Renault for . Alonso had an improved season: he finished the season-opening in third position and took three more podium finishes that year. He took pole position for the but achieved no race victories en route to fourth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 59 points. Alonso stayed at Renault for . He duelled with McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen for the World Championship in 2005 due to regulation changes prohibiting teams from changing tyres during a race and requiring engines to last for two races before they could be changed. Alonso&#x27;s car was more reliable than Räikkönen&#x27;s albeit lacking in speed. Alonso eclipsed Emerson Fittipaldi as the youngest World Drivers&#x27; Champion, having won seven victories, six pole positions and fourteen podium finishes for 133 points altogether.
He signed a contract extension with Renault for in April 2005. Bookmakers installed Alonso as the favourite to retain the Drivers&#x27; Championship. His primary competition was Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher. Alonso won six of the first nine races and finished no lower than second to lead the championship with 84 out of a possible 90 points. An Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; F1&#x27;s governing body)-imposed ban on Renault&#x27;s tuned mass damper device to slow Alonso and an increase of development into Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari for competitiveness saw the two tied on points entering the season&#x27;s penultimate round, the . Alonso won the race as Schumacher retired due to an engine failure whilst leading. He needed to score one point at the season-ending for a second title. Alonso won the championship by finishing second and was Formula 1&#x27;s youngest double World Champion.

==== McLaren and second stint with Renault (2007–2009) ====
He and McLaren team owner Ron Dennis met secretly in Japan after Dennis talked to Alonso about driving for the team in the future and Alonso expressed interest in the idea. Both men agreed to a three-year contract for Alonso to drive for McLaren starting from . Alonso&#x27;s contract with Renault expired on 31 December 2006, and he was not granted an early release for sponsorship reasons. Renault allowed Alonso to make his first appearance for McLaren in a test session at the Circuito de Jerez in November 2006. His main competitors in 2007 were his teammate Lewis Hamilton and Räikkönen at Ferrari. Alonso achieved four Grand Prix victories in Malaysia, Monaco, Europe and Italy and led the championship until Hamilton overtook him. Prior to the season&#x27;s final round, the , he had 103 championship points to Räikkönen&#x27;s 100 and Hamilton&#x27;s 107, and needed to win the race and for his teammate to finish third or lower for his third title. Alonso finished the event third for third overall with 109 points. He had the same number of points as Hamilton; the tie was broken on count-back as Hamilton finished second more often than Alonso.

Throughout the season, Alonso and Hamilton were involved in a number of incidents, such as the espionage scandal and the flare-up during qualifying for the when Hamilton disobeyed a team instruction, thus disadvantaging Alonso, and Alonso responded by delaying Hamilton in the pit lane. The tensions culminated in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November. Alonso was forbidden from joining a team whom McLaren considered their primary challengers for . After rejecting offers from several teams, he signed a two-year contract to rejoin Renault from 2008 because of the manufacturer&#x27;s long-term commitment to F1 and on-track record. Alonso&#x27;s car lacked power early on due to an imposed moratorium in development and he scored nine points in the first seven races. He was thereafter able to improve his performance later due to aerodynamic developments to the car&#x27;s and won in Singapore and Japan; the former race saw Renault order his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. to crash deliberately and trigger the deployment of the safety car in what became known as &quot;crashgate&quot;. Alonso scored more points than any other driver in the final five races with 43. He scored 61 points for fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Alonso was due to become a free agent for if Renault were lower than third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. After offers from Red Bull Racing and Honda, he re-signed to Renault on a two-year contract. His car proved to be noncompetitive because it lacked a dual diffuser system and outright speed. Alonso eschewed an aerodynamic front wing mandated in an attempt to make overtaking more possible since he did not believe it would help him. He scored points in eight races and achieved one podium finish: a third-place at the . Alonso won pole position for the and led the first 12 laps before he retired following an incorrectly fitted right-front wheel. Alonso was ninth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 26 points, his lowest placing since he came sixth in 2003; he maintained his reputation as one of F1&#x27;s best drivers.

==== Ferrari (2010–2014) ====

Alonso agreed with Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo to drive for Ferrari in 2009, but team principal Jean Todt extended the contracts of both Felipe Massa and Räikkönen to . Alonso obtained a mid-2009 agreement to drive for Ferrari from on but it was moved to 2010 after Renault were investigated for race fixing in Singapore and Räikkönen was released from the team. McLaren&#x27;s Hamilton and Button and Red Bull&#x27;s of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber were Alonso&#x27;s main championship competition. He won five races that season and entered the season-ending leading by eight points after being 47 behind mid-season following errors. Alonso finished runner-up to Vettel after finishing seventh thereby losing 19 points to Vettel who won the race.

His 2011 season was mixed: his car was built conservatively and lacked aerodynamic grip and tyre handling in qualifying. He extracted additional pace from his car to claim ten podium finishes and win the after a strategy error from Red Bull. His best qualification of the year was a second at the and he out-qualified his teammate Massa fifteen times over the course of the season. Alonso was fourth overall with 257 points; he was in contention to finish second to eventual champion Vettel following a series of strong finishes until Webber won the season-ending .
Ahead of , Alonso extended his contract with Ferrari until . His main competition for the title in 2012 was Vettel. Wins in Malaysia, Valencia and Germany and consistent points-scoring finishes allowed him to build a 40-point lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Thereafter start-line collisions, a mechanical failure and an improved performance for Vettel eliminated Alonso&#x27;s points lead. Alonso entered the season-ending 13 points behind Vettel and needed to finish third and for Vettel not to score points for a third championship. He was second and Vettel finished fourth, despite spinning on the opening lap, resigning Alonso to be runner-up for the second time in his career on 278 points.

To begin , Alonso drove an aggressively designed car allowing him to win in China and Spain and consistently scored points. He was slower than Vettel after a change of tyre compound at the and front and rear bodywork components intended to improve his car&#x27;s performance were ineffective. With 242 points, Alonso was second for the third time in his career. His relationship with Ferrari cooled due to his perception the team could not construct a title-winning car.

Alonso&#x27;s 2014 season saw him achieve no race wins because his car was less powerful than the championship-winning Mercedes but took third in the and second in the . Alonso fell to sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 161 points. He qualified faster than his teammate Räikkönen 16 times by an average of more than second per lap in 2014.

==== Return to McLaren (2015–2019) ====
Alonso had severe disagreements with team principal Marco Mattiacci in 2014 and left Ferrari after contract negotiations to remain at the team fell through. He rejoined McLaren on a three-year contract from to with no opt-out clauses. An accident during a pre-season test session at Spain&#x27;s Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in February 2015 saw Alonso sustain a concussion and he was replaced by reserve driver Kevin Magnussen for the season-opening . He endured a difficult season: his car&#x27;s Honda engine was under-powered and overall speed leaving him vulnerable to being passed. Alonso scored points twice in 2015: a tenth in the and a fifth in the for 17th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 11 points. He was dissatisfied with a slow pace, which became evident after multiple radio complaints that year.
Despite the unreliable and noncompetitive car, Alonso remained with McLaren for . Injuries from a heavy crash with Esteban Gutiérrez at the season-opening caused him to miss the on medical grounds and was replaced by reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne. He qualified better than teammate Button fifteen times and scored points nine times, which included two fifth-place finishes in the and the . He was tenth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 54 points.

Alonso stayed at McLaren in , but poor reliability affected his season, particularly during the early rounds, and his best finish was a sixth place in the . After three consecutive top-ten finishes, Alonso finished 15th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 17 points.
Following contract negotiations with the McLaren CEO Zak Brown, Alonso signed a multi-year extension with McLaren on 19 October 2017. He finished fifth at the season-opening 2018 and took nine top-ten finishes. Alonso out-qualified his teammate Stoffel Vandoorne at every race and drove quickly and aggressively. He became increasingly annoyed with certain drivers and his commitment to F1 waned after McLaren stopped developing their car to focus on . Alonso was 11th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 50 points, and left the sport as a driver at the end of the 2018 season, citing a perceived lack of on-track racing, the predictability of results and felt discussions away from racing about the broadcast of radio transmissions and polemics harmed the series.

He remained at McLaren as a brand ambassador to aid and advise drivers and drove in select test sessions to develop their cars. Alonso drove the MCL34 during a two-day in-season post-race Bahrain test in April 2019 to develop tyres for Pirelli. No further runs were planned for him and McLaren focused on their current drivers. Alonso&#x27;s ambassador contract with McLaren expired at the end of 2019, and was not renewed for 2020.

==== Alpine (2021–2022) ====

Alonso was signed to drive for Alpine F1 Team for the season, alongside Esteban Ocon, with Renault having rebranded the team under its new name. In preparation for his F1 return, Alonso performed four testing days driving the Renault R.S.18 and was quickest in the post-2020 season young driver&#x27;s test driving the Renault R.S.20 for Renault. In his first race with Alpine at the 2021 Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso was forced to retire after plastic debris entered his brake duct. At the 2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix he finished in 11th after qualifying 15th, with teammate Ocon finishing ahead in tenth, but both were upgraded one position after Kimi Räikkönen was penalised, giving Alonso his first points of the season.

In Hungary, Alonso temporarily led the race before he made a pit stop and fell to fourth, ahead of Lewis Hamilton. Teammate Ocon credited Alonso&#x27;s defence against Hamilton with enabling him to achieve his first race victory. In August 2021, Alonso invoked an option to extend his contract for the season. Alonso scored points in multiple races following the summer break, finishing sixth in the Netherlands, eighth in Italy, sixth in Russia, having run in third in Russia before being forced to pit under wet conditions, and third in Qatar. His third-place finish at Qatar was his first podium finish since the 2014 Hungarian Grand Prix.

For the 2022 season, Alonso remained with Alpine. Alonso achieved his highest start driving for Alpine during wet qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix, starting in second, but had to endure questionable strategies and an engine issue that developed during the race. He dropped down to seventh, and furthermore, received a post-race time penalty that dropped him down to ninth.

==== Aston Martin (2023–) ====
Alonso joined Aston Martin on a multi-year deal in alongside Lance Stroll. He joined the team because he wanted a multi-year contract extension, and Alpine was only willing to give him one more year in F1.

On his Aston Martin debut at the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso, benefitting from the much-improved machinery of the Aston Martin AMR23, recovered from a first-lap contact with his teammate Lance Stroll without any damage and went on to finish in 3rd place, securing a podium finish and Aston&#x27;s first since Sebastian Vettel&#x27;s podium at the 2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix (the German would finish second at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix but would be disqualified due to insufficient fuel sample). Despite having to serve a penalty due to his car being off-position at the starting grid, he finished in third again at the following race at the 2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix; this marked his 100th podium, making him the sixth driver to have scored 100 podiums in his career. Following the race, he was issued another ten-second penalty due to serving the first one improperly at his pit stop, dropping him to fourth behind George Russell; however, the team&#x27;s appeal was accepted and the second penalty was reversed, keeping his podium.

Alonso finished in third once again after a chaotic Australian Grand Prix; the third and final restart of the session saw his car make contact with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz Jr., causing the latter driver to receive a five-second penalty; due to this, Sainz would be classified in last place out of the finishing cars. Alonso&#x27;s car was undamaged. Alonso agreed with Sainz&#x27;s criticisms of the penalty, stating that it was &quot;too harsh&quot;. The Aston Martins were plagued with DRS issues during qualification of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, going on to qualify eighth in the new &quot;sprint shootout&quot; qualification and sixth for the main qualification session; he would finish sixth in the sprint race, and fourth in the main race. It was at this point in time the car had dropped in performance, failing to secure podiums on a consistent basis, though he took two podium finishes at Zandvoort, where he recorded his first fastest lap since the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix, and São Paulo; the latter instance edging out Sergio Pérez by 0.053 seconds. After a seventh-place finish at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Alonso ended the season fourth in the standings, scoring 206 points against his teammate Stroll&#x27;s 74. Alonso&#x27;s fourth position in the standings was his highest finish since .

At the 2024 Mexico City Grand Prix, Alonso competed in his 400th Grand Prix weekend, becoming the first driver to reach this number of races.

===Endurance racing===
Alonso made his sports car endurance racing debut at the 1999 24 Hours of Barcelona. Paired with Antonio García, Salvi Delmuns and the journalist Pedro Fermín Flores, the quartet finished third in the M10 class and tenth overall in a Hyundai Accent. Alonso was due to enter the 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans with Porsche&#x27;s Le Mans Prototype 1 team before Honda blocked it.

====WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (2018–2019)====

Alonso drove a Ligier JS P217 entered by United Autosports in the 2018 24 Hours of Daytona as preparation for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Alonso, Philip Hanson and McLaren reserve driver Lando Norris qualified 13th and finished 38th after multiple mechanical issues affected the car during the race. Alonso returned to race in the 2019 24 Hours of Daytona with Wayne Taylor Racing. He shared a Cadillac DPi-V.R with Kamui Kobayashi, Renger van der Zande and Jordan Taylor. The quartet completed 593 laps to win the rain-shortened event.

====FIA World Endurance Championship (2018–2019)====
Brown discussed an entry for the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans with Alonso and was prepared to consent to a switch to another team if certain circumstances were met. Alonso and Toyota held talks and agreed to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. He visited Toyota&#x27;s factory in Cologne for a seat fitting in a TS050 Hybrid in November 2017. Toyota entered Alonso into a post-season rookie test at the Bahrain International Circuit later that month. In January 2018, McLaren and Toyota reached an agreement to allow Alonso to enter the full 2018–19 FIA World Endurance Championship. He joined Sébastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima in Toyota&#x27;s 8 TS050 Hybrid.

Alonso drove a 2018 TS050 Hybrid in a three-day test session at the Ciudad del Motor de Aragón in February and drove with no artificial lights in a 24-hour kart race as preparation. He, Buemi and Nakajima won the LMP1 Drivers&#x27; Championship with five victories including the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 2019 24 Hours of Le Mans over the eight round season, though this was enhanced by their teammates Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi and José María López suffering a sensor issue while leading the 2019 6 Hours of Spa and then suffering a puncture while comfortably leading the 2019 24 Hours of Le Mans with an hour remaining. Alonso left the series at the end of the season.

===IndyCar Series===
====McLaren Honda Andretti (2017)====
Before the 2017 Australian Grand Prix, Zak Brown said to Alonso they should enter the 2017 Indianapolis 500 to which Alonso suggested he was joking. The idea later re-emerged in a conversation in Los Angeles, when Alonso told Brown he was happy with the idea since McLaren had won it before. He and his manager Garcia Abad met Brown and Éric Boullier in China to talk more about the plan and said he would decide the next day. Alonso told Brown he wanted to race at Indianapolis and told him it was &quot;a good decision for everyone: a win, win for myself, for F1, the fans, everyone&#x27;.&quot; Brown then spoke to the IndyCar Series chief executive officer Mark Miles and discovered that there were no Honda-powered cars. Miles met the Andretti Autosport owner Michael Andretti, who got driver Stefan Wilson to agree to forego his planned entry in partnership with Michael Shank Racing and allow Alonso to drive instead.

Driving the No. 29 McLaren-Honda-Andretti Dallara DW12, he completed a three-stage rookie orientation programme at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on 3 May. Alonso advanced to the Fast Nine shootout in qualifying and set the fifth-fastest four-lap average speed; in the race, he led four times for a total of 27 laps before his engine failed with 21 laps to go. Alonso was classified 24th.

====McLaren Racing (2019)====

McLaren began planning an entry for him in the 2019 IndyCar Series in August 2018 and would be supported by the series. Alonso tested a 2018-specification Andretti Autosport-entered Dallara DW12-Honda at the Barber Motorsports Park on 5 September. McLaren opted to enter just the 2019 Indianapolis 500 due to its focus on Formula One and collaborated with Carlin Motorsport in a logistical and technical partnership and signed an engine supply deal with Chevrolet. Alonso ventured to the McLaren Technology Centre in early March 2019 for a seat fitting to become comfortable in the No. 66 Dallara IR18-Chevrolet and its brake pedal was shifted away from his feet since it is used less in IndyCar than in Formula One. Andy Brown was Alonso&#x27;s race engineer and his chief mechanic was Liam Dance. Alonso did not qualify after Juncos Racing&#x27;s Kyle Kaiser demoted him to 34th. Reasons included a dismantled spare car needed to assembled and flown from Carlin&#x27;s factory after Alonso crashed in practice. An error converting from the American imperial system to the British metric system caused his car to scrape along the tarmac surface and incorrect gear ratios slowed him.

====Arrow McLaren SP (2020)====
He entered the 2020 Indianapolis 500 with Arrow McLaren SP after an agreement with Andretti Autosports fell through.
Alonso had a crash during practice. He qualified 26th.
Alonso did manage to finish the race. He started 26th, was running 15th halfway through the race, and then ended up P21 and one lap down because of a clutch issue causing the team to manually start the car during every pit stop.

===Off-road racing===
Alonso entered the Dakar Rally with Toyota in 2020 following a five-month testing programme in Africa, Europe and the Middle East and driving a series of races to better himself. He raced in the Lichtenburg 400 in South Africa, the Rally du Maroc in Morocco and the Al Ula–Neom Rally in Saudi Arabia, with the five-time Dakar Rally bike class winner Marc Coma his co-driver. Alonso was third at the Al Ula-Neom Rally, which was his highest finish in three preparation events. With co-driver Coma, he finished the Dakar in 13th position with a best stage finish of second place. A stop for repairs on the second stage and a roll on the tenth lost him several hours in the general classification.

==Driving style==
Alonso is often regarded as one of the greatest F1 drivers in the history of the sport. Journalists and fellow drivers regarded Alonso as a fast and consistent driver who can extract additional pace from a car in all weathers and on all tracks. Fisichella said Alonso understands when to go faster and when to preserve his tyres in a race. Former racing driver and Sky Sports pundit Martin Brundle described Alonso as &quot;Senna-like in his intimate feel for where the grip is&quot; and cited the driver&#x27;s knowledge on how much grip to use for the entry to a turn. He drives aggressively and uses a braking area to put a car into a corner without losing speed exiting it. This allows Alonso to keep it &quot;on the edge of adhesion&quot; and it has been observed during a qualifying session and the first laps of a race. 1979 world champion Jody Scheckter has criticised Alonso for causing problems in teams. This opinion is shared by Christian Horner, who ruled out signing Alonso for Red Bull, as he caused chaos in previous teams.

Alonso&#x27;s experience increased his awareness of events around him and competitors in a race and adjusted his situation to focus on the drivers&#x27; championship. Alonso is an all-round driver who can mount an apex and correct a sliding car to go faster. He is careful in finding the ideal feeling with his brakes and can apply the maximum amount of force with a fast response time. Alonso&#x27;s physical strength contrasts his braking skill and regularly exceeded that limit without overdoing it on multiple conditions. According to Jonathan Noble of Motorsport.com, this allows Alonso to &quot;create a kind of natural ABS – fully exploiting tyre grip to achieve greater speeds while turning without locking the wheels.&quot;

==Helmet and career number==

Alonso&#x27;s helmet manufactured by Bieffe (2001), Arai (2003–2009, 2016), Schuberth (2010–2015)
Bell (2017–) sports the yellow and red colours of the flag of Spain with shades of blue from the Asturias flag and coupled with two silver thunderbolt arrows derived from a remote control car he received as a present in his childhood on top and a yellow Asturian cross (sometimes on the back, other times on the side). He changed its mainbase colour design when switching teams during his F1 career; in 2008 Alonso attached two pictures of a spade, ace and heart symbol to show he was a two-time world champion.

For three successive Monaco Grand Prix from 2011 to 2013 and at the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix, he wore a gold and white coloured helmet to replace the blue and yellow. At the following 2013 Indian Grand Prix, Alonso sported a white helmet to celebrate his total number of career points scored up to the preceding Japanese Grand Prix of 1571 and with the words &quot;F1 points World Record&quot; accompanied with a thank you message in English, French and Italian.

His final event for Ferrari at the 2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix saw him wear a helmet with a picture depicting a pit stop in that year in the colour red, signature of various team members and the flag of Italy in the centre. At the 2017 Indianapolis 500 and the 2017 United States Grand Prix, Alonso sported a black helmet with red, yellow and blue stripes around it and his race number. He revised the livery for the 2018 24 Hours of Daytona to white instead of black and had no stripes around the front. The back had the layout of the Daytona International Speedway and continued to have his usual blue, red and yellow colours.

In 2018 Alonso changed its front livery to be predominantly blue with the back top lighter blue and the rear red and yellow. His helmet for the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was divided equally between the flag of Spain on the right with a blue-checkered pattern around its side. The yellow on that area was replaced by gold between two horizontal stripes in red and a thick vertical strip was added with a list of Alonso&#x27;s 32 F1 race victories.

For the 2014 season, the FIA created a new regulation allowing drivers to select specific car numbers for use throughout their F1 career. Alonso requested the number 14 for it has been his lucky number since his world karting championship victory in a kart with number 14, at the age of 14, on 14 July 1996.

==Driver management==
Alonso operates a driver management company, A14 Management. A14 Management manages a portfolio of young drivers across several motorsport disciplines. For the 2023 season, this included Maximilian Günther, Clément Novalak, Nikola Tsolov, Gabriel Bortoleto, Pepe Martí, Han Cenyu, Andrés Cárdenas and Carl Bennett.

==Image and impact==
Nate Saunders of ESPN writes that Alonso &quot;is one of the most eloquent speakers in F1 and one of the best at interacting with the media&quot;. He occasionally uses press conferences with the press to cultivate particular narratives of a story, convey himself as controlling the F1 driver market or as the one with knowledge of facts of a situation. Alonso dislikes fame and prefers a private life, with Chris Jenkins of &quot;USA Today&quot; describing him as shy. He has been noted for refraining from expensive habits and possessions.

Alonso&#x27;s public persona has been noted as being different from his private personality. Fellow Spanish driver Carlos Sainz Jr. claimed &quot;there are two Fernandos&quot;, alluding to Alonso&#x27;s defensive nature when criticised because of his shyness, compared to his sense of humour, generosity and kind-nature when not racing. According to the &quot;Autosport&quot; journalist Ben Anderson, Alonso&#x27;s success in F1 required him to behave egotistically and selfishly and to have a self-confidence, in order to cope with the consequences of &quot;burst[ing] egotistical bubbles&quot; to improve himself. Alonso acknowledged the façade and told Anderson &quot;I know who I am outside of F1, but that remains a question mark for everybody because I like to separate my personal life from my professional life&quot; and his different personality traits in public and private. Alonso made a voice cameo appearance as an anthropomorphic version of himself in the Spanish dub of &quot;Cars 2&quot; (2011), and a voice command assistant in the Spanish dub of &quot;Cars 3&quot; (2017).

Journalist Nigel Roebuck calls Alonso &quot;the first world-class racing driver to come out of Spain&quot;, and is credited for popularising F1 in the country, where it was once considered a fringe sport and a lesser known form of motorsport than motorcycling and rallying. He was Personality Media&#x27;s favourite male athlete with a 99 per cent recognition rating amongst the Spanish public in 2015; in the latter part of his F1 career, Alonso was within the top two most popular drivers in the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association fan surveys of 2010, 2015 and 2017.

The Fernando Alonso Sports Complex in Oviedo was opened in June 2015 and features a CIK-FIA compliant karting track featuring 29 layouts. A museum dedicated to his racing career, the &#x27;Museo y Circuito Fernando Alonso&#x27;, opened in the same year, featuring Alonso&#x27;s race cars, helmets, overalls, and memorabilia.

===Endorsements and philanthropy===

Alonso has done business with Banco Santander, Cajastur, TAG Heuer, Europcar, Silestone, Liberbank, ING, Chandon, Adidas, and Bang &amp; Olufsen. He is the founder and brand ambassador of the fashion retailer Kimoa, and intended to establish the Fernando Alonso Cycling Team to compete in UCI events in 2015 before the project failed to materialise. As a result of Alonso&#x27;s endorsement money and F1 salary, he has been listed as one of the world&#x27;s highest-paid athletes by &quot;Forbes&quot; every year from 2012 to 2018. The magazine named him motorsport&#x27;s top-earning driver from June 2012 to June 2013, one of 2016&#x27;s top earning international stars, and one of 2017&#x27;s highest-paid international and European celebrities. Alonso also featured on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list in 2008 and 2017. In 2020, Alonso was sponsored by Ruoff Mortgage for his Indianapolis 500 attempt.

Alonso was appointed director of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (GPDA) along with Mark Webber and Ralf Schumacher. He held that post from 2006 to 2010.

In November 2017 Alonso established the FA Racing G2 Logitech G eSports racing team of which he is the team principal and competes in virtual online racing championships on multiple platforms. The team dissolved in 2018 and launched another in partnership with FA Racing and Veloce Esports in March 2019. Alonso&#x27;s team has also competed in the F4 Spanish Championship, Formula Renault Eurocup and karting. He is an investor and board member of the eSports multi-racing platform Motorsport Games.

The UNICEF Spanish Committee named Alonso a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in February 2005 to promote and defend children&#x27;s rights and awareness of UNICEF. Alonso promoted India&#x27;s efforts to eradicate polio in 2011 and handwashing with soap to school children in 2012, whilst he also supported UNICEF&#x27;s anti-cyberbullying campaign in November 2017. Alonso founded the Fundación Fernando Alonso () in 2007 to promote motor racing and road safety education.

===Awards===
Alonso received the 2003 &quot;Autosport&quot; Gregor Grant Award for winning the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix. He also won the Princess Cristina National Sports Award for sporting newcomer in that year. Alonso was named the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy&#x27;s recipient in April 2005. From October 2005 to May 2006 he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Sports, the Premios Nacionales del Deporte Sportsman of the Year Award and the Gold Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit for winning the 2005 F1 World Championship.

He was named the 2006 Autosport International Racing Driver of the Year. Alonso was voted the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year for his performance in the 2017 Indianapolis 500. He was inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame in 2017 for being a F1 World Champion and again as a FIA World Endurance Champion in 2019. This made Alonso the first driver to have been inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame twice.

==Personal life==

From November 2006 to December 2011, Alonso was married to Raquel del Rosario, the lead singer of the Spanish pop band El Sueño de Morfeo. He was engaged to Spanish television presenter Lara Álvarez from 2015 to 2016. Alonso dated Italian model Linda Morselli from 2016 to 2021.

Alonso supports the Real Madrid and Real Oviedo football teams, and is a cycling enthusiast. He is tall, and speaks English, French, Italian and Spanish. His personal garage includes such cars as the McLaren P1, Ferrari 458 Italia, Nissan GT-R, and Honda NSX.

<doc id="240391" wikidata="Q848370" url="?curid=240391" title="Fall line">
<text>A fall line (or fall zone) is the area where an upland region and a coastal plain meet and is noticeable especially the place rivers cross it, with resulting rapids or waterfalls. The uplands are relatively hard crystalline basement rock, and the coastal plain is softer sedimentary rock. A fall line often will recede upstream as a river cuts out the uphill dense material, forming &quot;c&quot;-shaped waterfalls and exposing bedrock shoals. Due to these features, riverboats typically cannot travel any further inland without portaging, unless locks are built. The rapid change of elevation of the water and resulting energy release make the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Seeking a head of navigation with a ready supply of water power, people have long made settlements where rivers cross a fall line.

==Geography==

The slope of rivers crossing fall zones affected settlement patterns. For example, the fall line represents the inland limit of navigation of many rivers. Numerous cities along a fall line grew as a result of demand for transferring people and goods between land-based and water-based transportation at that place.

===North American Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line===


The Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line, or Fall Zone, is a escarpment where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain meet in the eastern United States. Much of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line passes through areas where no evidence of faulting is present.

The fall line marks the geologic boundary of hard metamorphosed terrain—- the product of the Taconic orogeny—- and the sandy, relatively flat outwash plain of the upper continental shelf, formed of unconsolidated Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments. Examples of the Fall Zone include the Potomac River&#x27;s Little Falls and the rapids in Richmond, Virginia, where the James River falls across a series of rapids down to the tidal estuary of the James River. Columbia, South Carolina, is similar as well with the Congaree River.

Before navigation improvements such as locks, the fall line was often the of rivers due to rapids and waterfalls, like the Little Falls of the Potomac River. Numerous cities were founded at the intersection of rivers and the fall line. U.S. Route 1 links many of the fall line cities.

In the USA, Mid-Atlantic and Southern fall line cities include:
*Paterson, New Jersey, on the Passaic River
*Trenton, New Jersey, on the Delaware River
*Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the Schuylkill River
*Wilmington, Delaware, on Brandywine Creek
*Baltimore, Maryland, on the Jones Falls, Gunpowder Falls and Gwynns Falls
*Washington, D.C., on the Potomac River
*Fredericksburg, Virginia, on the Rappahannock River
*Hanover, Virginia, on the North Anna River
*Richmond, Virginia, on the James River
*Petersburg, Virginia, on the Appomattox River
*Weldon, North Carolina, and Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, on the Roanoke River
*Rocky Mount, North Carolina, on the Tar River
*Raleigh, North Carolina, on the Neuse River
*Fayetteville, North Carolina, on the Cape Fear River
*Camden, South Carolina, on the Wateree River
*Columbia, South Carolina, on the Congaree River
*Augusta, Georgia, on the Savannah River
*Milledgeville, Georgia, on the Oconee River
*Macon, Georgia, on the Ocmulgee River
*Columbus, Georgia, on the Chattahoochee River
*Tallassee, Alabama, on the Tallapoosa River
*Wetumpka, Alabama, on the Coosa River
*Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on the Black Warrior River

===Canada===
The Laurentian Upland forms a long scarp line where it meets the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands. Along this line, numerous rivers have carved falls and canyons (listed east to west):
*Saint Anne Falls and Canyon Sainte-Anne (River Sainte-Anne-du-Nord)
*Chaudron à Gaudreault (Rivière aux Chiens)
*Unnamed falls (Rivière du Sault à la Puce)
*Canyon of the River Cazeau
*Montmorency Falls (River Montmorency)
*Kabir Kouba Fall (River Saint-Charles)
*Chute Ford (River Sainte-Anne)
*Sainte-Ursule Falls (River Maskinongé)
*Chute à Magnan (Rivière du Loup)
*Chutes Émery and Chute du Moulin Coutu (Rivière Bayonne)
*Les sept chutes (River de L&#x27;Assomption)
*Dorwin Falls (River Ouareau)
*Wilson Falls (Rivière du Nord)
*Long Sault, now flooded by the Carillon hydroelectric generating station (Ottawa River)
**The Chaudière Falls run over the unrelated Eardley Escarpment of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben.
The River Jacques-Cartier and River Saint-Maurice lack such noticeable features because they cross the scarp through U-shaped valleys. The falls of the lower Saint-Maurice (as well as those of the River Beauport, in Quebec City) are due to the fluvial terraces of the Saint Lawrence river rather than the Laurentian Scarp.

<text>Palawan (, ), officially the Province of Palawan (; ), is an archipelagic province of the Philippines that is located in the region of Mimaropa. It is the largest province in the country in terms of total area of . The capital and largest city is Puerto Princesa which is geographically grouped with but administered independently from the province. Palawan is known as the Philippines&#x27; &quot;Last Frontier&quot; and as the Philippines&#x27; &quot;Best Island&quot;.
The islands of Palawan stretch between Mindoro island in the northeast and Borneo in the southwest. It lies between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. The province is named after its largest island, Palawan Island (), measuring long, and wide.

In 2019, it was proposed to divide Palawan into three separate provinces, though the proposal was rejected by the local population in a 2021 plebiscite.

==History==

===Pre-history===
The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Robert Bradford Fox. They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years. They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts.

Two articulated phalanx bones of a tiger, besides another phalanx piece, were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools in Ille Cave near the village of New Ibajay. The other animal fossils were ascribed to macaques, deer, bearded pigs, small mammals, lizards, snakes and turtles. From the stone tools, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones. Additionally, the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the Upper Paleolithic. The tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the cortical bone due to weathering, which suggests that they had post-mortem been exposed to light and air. Tiger parts were commonly used as amulets in South and Southeast Asia, so it may be that the tiger parts were imported from elsewhere, as is the case with tiger canine teeth, which were found in Ambangan sites dating to the 10th to 12th centuries in Butuan, Mindanao. On the other hand, the proximity of Borneo and Palawan also makes it likely that the tiger had colonized Palawan from Borneo before the Early Holocene.

Using the work of Von den Driesch, all chosen anatomical features of appendicular elements&#x27; anatomical features which were chosen, besides molars, were measured to distinguish between taxa that had close relationships, and see morphometric changes over ages, though not for pigs or deer. For the latter two, cranial and mandibular elements, besides teeth of deer from Ille Cave were compared with samples of the Philippine brown deer (&quot;Cervus mariannus&quot;), Calamian hog deer (&quot;Axis calamianensis&quot;), and Visayan spotted deer (&quot;Cervus alfredi&quot;), and thus two taxa of deer have been identified from the fossils: &quot;Axis&quot; and &quot;Cervus&quot;. Remains of pigs were compared with the Eurasian (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) and Palawanese wild boar (&quot;Sus ahoenobarbus&quot;). It is known that the Eurasian wild boar was imported as a domesticate to the islands from mainland Southeast Asia to the islands during the Terminal Holocene.

Palawan was a major site for the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world, operating for 3,000 years from 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.

===Early history===
Palawan is home to several Indigenous groups. The oldest inhabitants are the Palaw&#x27;an, Batak, Tagbanwa, and Tau&#x27;t Bato who are from the interiors and highlands of Palawan, as well as the Calamianes Islands. They traditionally practice animist &quot;anito&quot; religions. Palawan&#x27;s coastlines were also settled by later groups that are now collectively known as &quot;Palaweños&quot;. Prior to Islamization, the islands of Palawan, Calamian, and parts of Luzon were under the jurisdiction of the nation Sandao (In Chinese records at the 1200s). Sandao was a vassal-state to the more powerful Ma-i nation in Mindoro. Thereafter, groups like the Islamized Molbog people of southern Palawan (possibly originally from Sabah), and the Cuyonon and Agutaynon groups (from the nearby islands of Cuyo and Agutaya settled in.

Palawan was mentioned as &quot;Pulaoan&quot; or &quot;Polaoan&quot; by Antonio Pigafetta in 1521 during Magellan&#x27;s expedition. They called it (&quot;the land of promise&quot;) due to the fact that they were almost starving by the time they reached the island. The local &quot;datu&quot; made peace with the expedition through a blood compact. The ships&#x27; crews were welcomed to the island with rice cooked in bamboo tubes, rice wine, bananas, pigs, goats, chickens, coconuts, sugarcane, and other supplies. Pigafetta described the inhabitants as being farmers. Their primary weapons were blowguns with iron tips that could both shoot thick wooden or bamboo darts (some poisoned) and function as spears once their ammunition were exhausted. Pigafetta also described the islanders as keeping roosters for cockfighting.

Before the arrival of the Spanish in the late 15th century, Palawan broke free of the nation of Ma-i but would be conquered and ruled by Bruneian empire and their vassals the Sultanate of Sulu.

===Spanish colonial era===
The northern Calamianes Islands were the first to come under Spanish authority, and were later declared a province separate from the Palawan mainland. In the early 17th century, Spanish friars sent out missions in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay and Cagayancillo but they met resistance from Moro communities. Before the 18th century, Colonial Authorities began to build churches enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the towns of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan and Balabac. In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei ceded southern Palawan to Spain.

In 1818, the entire island of Palawan, or &quot;Paragua&quot; as it was called, was organized as a single province named &quot;Calamianes&quot;, with its capital in Taytay. By 1858, the province was divided into two provinces, namely, &quot;Castilla&quot;, covering the northern section with Taytay as capital and &quot;Asturias&quot; in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital. It was later divided into three districts, &quot;Calamianes&quot;, &quot;Paragua&quot; and &quot;Balabac&quot;, with Principe Alfonso town as its capital. During the Spanish colonial period, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.

===American colonial era===
In 1902, after the Philippine–American War, the United States established civil rule in northern Palawan, calling it the province of &quot;Paragua&quot;. In 1905, pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 1363, the province was reorganized to include the southern portions and renamed &quot;Palawan&quot;, and Puerto Princesa declared as its capital.

Many reforms and projects were later introduced in the province. Construction of school buildings, promotion of agriculture, and bringing people closer to the government were among the priority plans during this era.

===Japanese invasion era===

After the Japanese invasion, according to Stephen L. Moore, &quot;Pro-Allied sentiment was strong, and it was later estimated that during the war as many as 1,154 Filipino guerrillas worked against the Japanese on the island. Those in the underground network would proudly refer to themselves as &#x27;Palawan&#x27;s Fighting One Thousand&#x27;.&quot; Early resistance leaders included Dr. Higinio Acosta Mendoza, his wife Triny, Thomas F. Loudon, and his son-in-law Nazario Mayor. Capt. Mayor organized Company D in October 1943, and was responsible for the area encompassing Puerto Princesa south to Balabac Island. Capt. Mendoza covered the area north of Puerto Princesa to Caramay. Lt. Felipe Batul operated out of Danlig, while Capt. Carlos Amores operated out of Sibaltan. Overall command of the Palawan Special Battalion was under Major Pablo P. Muyco as part of the 6th Military District. The Palawan guerrillas helped any escaping American POWs, supported two coastwatcher groups sending regular radio broadcasts to General MacArthur on Japanese movements, and helped rescue downed airmen as well as survivors from the submarine USS &quot;Flier&quot;. Most importantly, they helped guide the 8th Army&#x27;s troop landings.

====Palawan Massacre====

During World War II, in order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war by the advancing allies, on December 14, 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army (under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita) herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war at Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline. Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down. Only 11 men escaped the slaughter.

====Liberation====

During the first phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, just off the coast of Palawan, two United States Navy submarines, and attacked a Japanese cruiser task force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his flagship (in which he survived) , and her sister ship . &quot;Darter&quot; later ran aground that afternoon and was scuttled by .

The island was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Forces from February 28 to April 22, 1945, during the Invasion of Palawan.

===Philippine independence ===
====Martial law era====
Like the other parts of the Philippines, Palawan felt the impact when Ferdinand Marcos placed the whole country under martial law in September 1972, and then held on to power for 14 more years, until he was ousted by the 1986 EDSA People Power revolution.

One incident was when Marcos evicted an estimated 254 families of Indigenous Tagbanwa people from the Calauit Island in order to create a game reserve full of animals imported from Africa.

In another incident, residents of Bugsuk Island were driven from their homes and communities so that Marcos crony Eduardo Cojuangco could establish a coconut plantation.

Among the leaders who helped organize the effort to prevent the eviction of the Bugsuk Island residents was United Methodist Reverend Magnifico Osorio. When the effort failed, Reverend Osorio relocated to Bataraza, a town on the southernmost tip of Palawan Island, where he continued to fight for the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Palawan. In March 1985 he successfully facilitated a meeting between Indigenous peoples and the provincial governor, who promised to respect Indigenous rights as long as he was governor. A few weeks later, however, Reverend Osorio was found dead out in his ricefields, having been clubbed in the head and shot dead. For his work to protect the Indigenous peoples of Palawan, and for the circumstances of his death, Reverend Osorio was honored by having his name inscribed on the Wall of Remembrance at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes who fought the abuses of the Marcos dictatorship.

===Contemporary===
In 2005, Palawan was briefly made politically part of Western Visayas or &quot;Region VI&quot; through Executive Order 429 signed by then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on May 23 as a political move to control the province and a response to getting more loans from China. This decree was later deferred on August 18 within the same year reportedly due to the opposition of the province&#x27;s Sangguniang Panlalawigan (Provincial Council).

On July 21, 2007, its capital city Puerto Princesa became a highly urbanized city.

====Proposed division====

In April 2019, a bill dividing Palawan into three provinces was passed into law. The proposed three new provinces were Palawan del Norte, Palawan Oriental, and Palawan del Sur. A plebiscite, originally scheduled in May 2020, was held on March 13, 2021, that decided whether Palawan would be divided into three provinces. Some civil society groups and Puerto Princesa residents opposed the proposed division, claiming that there was no extensive public consultation. The Comelec announced on March 16, 2021, that the majority of Palawan residents opposed the division and thus, it would not be carried out.

==Geography==

The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets. The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands. Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait. In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea. The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometers to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the &quot;Kalayaan Group of Islands&quot;.

Palawan&#x27;s almost of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges. The mountain heights average in altitude, with the highest peak rising to at Mount Mantalingahan. The vast mountain areas are the source of valuable timber. The terrain is a mix of coastal plain, craggy foothills, valley deltas, and heavy forest interspersed with riverine arteries that serve as irrigation.

The province has a total land area of . When Puerto Princesa City is included for geographical purposes, its land area is . The land area is distributed to its &quot;mainland municipalities&quot;, comprising , and the &quot;island municipalities&quot;, which altogether measure . In terms of archipelagic internal waters, Palawan has the biggest marine resources that covers almost half of the Sulu Sea and a big chunk of the South China Sea that is within the municipal waters of Kalayaan Municipality which was officially annexed to the Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of &quot;Presidential Decree 1596&quot; dated June 11, 1978.

===Climate===
The province has two types of climate. The first, which occurs in the northern and southern extremities and the entire western coast, has two distinct seasons – six months dry and six months wet. The other, which prevails in the eastern coast, has a short dry season of one to three months and no pronounced rainy period during the rest of the year. The southern part of the province is virtually free from tropical depressions but northern Palawan experiences torrential rains during the months of July and August. Summer months serve as peak season for Palawan. Sea voyages are most favorable from March to early June when the seas are calm. The average maximum temperature is with little variation all year.

The island ecosystem of Palawan is threatened by climate change. For example, though mangroves and barrier reefs protect Puerto Princesa&#x27;s coastlines from supertyphoons, these barriers are subject to degradation due to El Niño, rising sea temperatures, and other climate change-related phenomena. A study by the World Wide Fund for Nature revealed that a spike in ocean acidification in 2010 came from Palawan&#x27;s waters.

===Administrative divisions===
Palawan comprises 433 barangays in 23 municipalities and the capital City of Puerto Princesa. As an archipelago, Palawan has 13 mainland municipalities and 10 island towns. There are three congressional districts, namely: the first district comprising five northern mainland municipalities and nine island towns; the second district composed of six southern mainland towns and the island municipality of Balabac; and the third district covering the capital City of Puerto Princesa and the town of Aborlan. Thirteen municipalities are considered as &quot;mainland municipalities&quot;, namely Aborlan, Narra, Quezon, Sofronio Española, Brooke&#x27;s Point, Rizal, and Bataraza (located south); San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, El Nido, and Taytay (found in the north). The remaining &quot;island municipalities&quot; are: Busuanga, Coron, Linapacan and Culion (forming the Calamianes group of islands), Cuyo, Agutaya and Magsaysay (the Cuyo group of islands), Araceli, Cagayancillo, Balabac and Kalayaan (Spratly Islands). The capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly urbanized city that governs itself independently from the province, but it usually grouped with the province for statistical and geographic purposes.



===Proposals===
====Inclusion into other regions====
In 2001, the residents of Palawan voted in a plebiscite to reject inclusion into an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

On May 17, 2002, &quot;Executive Order No. 103&quot; divided &quot;Region IV&quot; into &quot;Region IV-A&quot; (Calabarzon) and &quot;Region IV-B&quot; (Mimaropa), placing the province of Palawan into Mimaropa.

On May 23, 2005, &quot;Executive Order No. 429&quot; directed that Palawan be transferred from &quot;Region IV-B&quot; to Region VI. However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, &quot;Administrative Order No. 129&quot; was issued on August 19, 2005, that the implementation of &quot;EO 429&quot; be held in abeyance pending approval by the President of its implementation Plan. The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results. , the abeyance was still in effect and Palawan remained a part of Mimaropa.

====Proposed division into three provinces====

A March 2021 plebiscite (originally scheduled for May 2020 but delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic) asked about whether to divided Palawan into three provinces: Palawan del Norte (including El Nido, Taytay, Coron, Linapacan, Culion, and Busuanga), Palawan Oriental (includes San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, Cuyo, Agutaya, Magsaysay, and Cagayancillo), and Palawan del Sur (includes Kalayaan, Aborlan, Narra, Sofronio Española, Brooke&#x27;s Point, Rizal, Quezon, Bataraza and Balabac). The division was rejected by a majority.

==Demographics==


The population of Palawan in the 2020 census was 939,594 people, with a density of . When Puerto Princesa is included for geographical purposes, the population is 1,104,585 people, with a density of .

The province is a melting pot of 87 cultural groups and races. Eighteen percent is composed of cultural minority groups such as the Tagbanwa, Palawano, Batak, and Molbog.

===Religion===
====Roman Catholicism====

 The predominant religion in Palawan is Roman Catholicism. In 2017, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Princesa had a 68.8% adherence while the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay (Northern Palawan) had a 91.6% adherence. One of the religious orders that had a significant mission in the islands is the Order of Augustinian Recollects.

The Catholics in the province are governed by a single apostolic vicariate until 2002 when it was divided into two: the Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Princesa in Southern Palawan and the Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay in Northern Palawan.

====Protestantism and other groups====
Several Baptist and other Protestant denominations have a strong presence in Palawan as do the Church of the Foursquare Gospel in the Philippines, and the Seventh-day Adventists. Charismatic groups such as Jesus is Lord (JIL), Jesus Touch Fellowship (JTF) and the Life Church (formerly known at the Life Renewal Center).

The Members Church of God International (MCGI) popularly called Ang Dating Daan established four church districts namely Calamian (Consisting of island municipalities in the North), Central (Consisting of Puerto Princesa City), North (Consisting of Northern municipalities) &amp; South (Consisting of Southern municipalities) which signifies strong membership in the province.

Other Christian denominations including the indigenous Iglesia ni Cristo has many local congregations in the province established three Ecclesiastical District (Calamian, Palawan North, and Palawan South) each town has a barangay chapels signifies the existence of INC Faith, 2-3% of the entire province belongs to INC. The United Church of Christ in the Philippines or (UCCP), the Jesus Miracle Crusade, the Pentecostal Missionary Church of Christ or PMCC (4th Watch) as well as the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Philippine Independent Church or Aglipayan Church) which is standing as one diocese (The Diocese of Palawan). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a growing membership in the island province. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have an active membership of 181,236 in the Philippines as of 2012. Special pioneers from the Witnesses have been preaching to prisoners at the Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm in Palawan, and were permitted to build a small Kingdom Hall right on the premises.

====Islam====
Around 75,000 to 100,000 Palawan residents (10% to 13%) identify as Muslims, these being mostly the native Molbog who are concentrated in Balabac and Bataraza of the southern part of the island. Large numbers of Jama Mapun (Mapun Island) and Tausug (Sulu) migrants have also settled in southern Palawan, as well as a smaller number of Sama Pangutaran (Tawi-Tawi), Maranao (Lanao del Sur), and Yakan (Basilan). Maranao traders are more widely scattered throughout urban centers in Palawan, while the Yakan are mostly centered in the Rio Tuba area of Bataraza.

====Animism====
Most of the ethnic minorities such as Batak and Tagbanwa are traditionally animists, many of which have continued to preserve their ancient traditions passed on by their ancestors and onto the next generations. However, Christian missionaries have been active in some communities, reducing the prevalence of historic beliefs.

====Other religions====
A notable Buddhist Temple in Palawan is Chùa Vạn Pháp. The temple was built by Vietnamese refugees. They were temporarily settled in Palawan during the Indochina refugee crisis, while they awaited permanent resettlement to third countries. Almost all of the refugees have moved on to other countries in 2005 and 2006.

===Language===

There are 52 languages and dialects in the province, with Tagalog being spoken by more than 50 percent of the people. Languages native to the islands are Cuyonon (26.27 percent) and Palawano (4.0 percent). Kinaray-a is also present in Palawan, spoken by 19 percent of inhabitants. Before mass immigration to Palawan by various groups of people from Southern Tagalog, Ilocandia, Central Luzon, and Panay, Cuyonon was an established lingua franca amongst many of Palawan&#x27;s native peoples, including the Agutaynen, Cagayanen, Tagbanua, Palawan, and others. The usage of Cuyonon significantly dropped during 1990s &amp; the approach of the new millennium, being replaced by the now-majority Tagalog language, the reason for making Palawan part of Southern Tagalog. Tagalog may be usually spoken with Batangas dialect due to its geographical contact with Batangas and Mindoro and Batangueño residents in the island. In the south of Palawan during the occupation of the Sulu Sultanate, Tausug was a lingua franca amongst the minority Islamified ethnic groups, i.e., the Molbog, the Tausug (a non-native ethnic group), the Muslim Palaw&#x27;an, and the migratory Sama. By the 19th century, Cuyonon had replaced Tausug as a lingua franca. Many local Muslims and barter traders can also speak Sabah Malay.

English is spoken by a majority of the younger (age 20–39) population of Puerto Princesa. It is spoken by a minority in every other area of the province.

==Economy==

Palawan&#x27;s economy is basically agricultural. The three major crops are palay, corn and coconut. Mineral resources include nickel, copper, manganese, and chromite. Logging is also a major industry. Palawan has one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. About 45% of Manila&#x27;s supply of fish comes from here. Having natural gas reserves of approximately 30,000 trillion cubic feet, the province is the only oil-producing province in the country. In addition, tourism is also a thriving sector, having received 1.8 million tourists in 2018, a 21% year-over-year increase from 2017.

Pearl diving used to be a significant economic activity for Palawan until the advent of plastics. The world&#x27;s largest pearl, the diameter Pearl of Lao Tzu, was found off Palawan in 1934.

The economic and agricultural business growth of province is at 20% per annum. Coconut, sugar, rice, lumber, and livestock are produced here.

==Biodiversity==

Unlike most of the Philippines, Palawan is biogeographically part of Sundaland, with a fauna and flora
related to that found in Borneo.

Palawan had of forests as of 2010 and has been called the Philippines&#x27; &quot;last biodiversity frontier.&quot;

Among the many endemic species are the Palawan peacock-pheasant, Philippine mouse-deer, Philippine pangolin, Palawan bearded pig, and Palawan birdwing. In the forests and grasslands, the air resonates with the songs of more than 200 kinds of birds. Over 600 species of butterflies flutter around the mountains and fields of Palawan, attracted to some 1500 hosts plants found here. Endangered sea turtles nest on white sand beaches. Sea turtles usually go to the nutrient-rich coastal waters of Palawan to rest and look for food. Dugong numbers have fallen seriously, although Palawan still has a larger population than any other part of the country, and organizations such as Community Centred Conservation (C3) are working to end the unsustainable use of marine resources in Palawan and in Philippines.

Total forest cover is about 56 percent of the total land area of the province while mangrove forest accounts for 3.35 percent based on the 1998 Landsat imagery. Grasslands dwindled from 19 percent in 1992 to 12.40 percent in 1998. This is an indication of improving soil condition as deteriorating soil is normally invaded by grass species. Brushlands increased to 25 percent of the total land area. Sprawled beneath the seas are nearly 11,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, representing more than 35% of the country&#x27;s coral reefs.

Palawan, the only Philippine island cited, is rated by the &quot;Condé Nast Traveler Readers&quot; as the most beautiful island in the world and is also rated by the &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; magazine as the best island destination in East and Southeast Asia region in 2007, and the equal 27th best island in the world having &quot;incredibly beautiful natural seascapes and landscapes. One of the most biodiverse (terrestrial and marine) islands in the Philippines.

==Attractions==

===Calauit Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary===

A game reserve and wildlife sanctuary of exotic African animals and endangered endemic animals of Palawan. It is on Calauit Island in Busuanga. The reserve was established on August 31, 1976, by virtue of the &quot;Presidential Proclamation No. 1578&quot;. The explanation the Ferdinand Marcos administration gave for establishing the park was that it was responding to the appeal of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to help save African wildlife. However, the IUCN, which has a policy against relocating animals outside of their natural range, bears no record of such a request.

Since 2009, management of the area has been the responsibility of the Office of the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development.

===Kayangan Lake===

Accessible by a steep 10-minute climb, the crystal-clear waters of Kayangan Lake are nestled into the mountain walls; underwater is like a moonscape.

Don&#x27;t expect privacy or quiet, though, as the lake, an Instagram favorite, is overwhelmed by the cellphone-wielding masses during peak hours. To avoid the crowds you&#x27;ll need to visit on a private tour early in the morning or late in the afternoon.

<text>The APCO phonetic alphabet, a.k.a. LAPD radio alphabet, is the term for an old competing spelling alphabet to the ICAO radiotelephony alphabet, defined by the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International from 1941 to 1974, that is used by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and other local and state law enforcement agencies across the state of California and elsewhere in the United States. It is the &quot;over the air&quot; communication used for properly understanding a broadcast of letters in the form of easily understood words. Despite often being called a &quot;phonetic alphabet&quot;, it is not a phonetic alphabet for transcribing phonetics.

In 1974, APCO adopted the ICAO Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, making the APCO alphabet officially obsolete; however, it is still widely used, and relatively few police departments in the U.S. use the ICAO alphabet.

==Development==
The APCO first suggested that its Procedure and Signals Committee work out a system for a &quot;standard set of words representing the alphabet should be used by all stations&quot; in its April 1940 newsletter. By this point, APCO President Herb Wareing &quot;came out in favor of a standard list of words for alphabet letters, preferably suitable for both radiophone and radiotelegraph use.&quot;

The list was based on the results of questionnaires sent out by the Procedures Committee to all zone and interzone police radio stations. The questionnaire solicited suggestions, but also included the existing Western Union and Bell Telephone word lists, plus another list then in general use by a number of police stations. Lists used by military services were excluded because of a lack of permission to reproduce. The resulting final list differs from the Bell Telephone word list by only five words, and from the Western Union word list by only eight words.

==Replacement with international spelling alphabet==
In 1974, APCO adopted the ICAO International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, replacing the Adam-Boy-Charlie alphabet APCO first published in 1940. However, most police departments nationwide have kept using the 1940 APCO spelling alphabet, with those using the 1974 APCO spelling alphabet being the exception, rather than the rule. A partial list of police departments using the modern APCO/ICAO spelling alphabet includes:
* Saint Paul, Minnesota Police Department

==LAPD usage history==
At some point in the early history of emergency service mobile radio systems, the LAPD adopted the APCO radio spelling alphabet for relaying precise information on individual letters. For example, the license plate &quot;8QXG518&quot; might be read by a civilian as &quot;eight cue ex gee five eighteen&quot; but with accuracy being paramount, the police dispatcher would say &quot;eight queen x-ray george five one eight.&quot; Despite the development in 1941 of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet and its replacement, circa 1956, by the NATO phonetic alphabet (currently used by all NATO armed forces, civil aviation, amateur radio, telecommunications, and some law enforcement agencies), the LAPD and other law enforcement and emergency service agencies throughout the United States continue to use their traditional system.

APCO&#x27;s Project 14 updated the definition of Ten-codes, and also adopted the international radiotelephony spelling alphabet for use by law enforcement nationwide.

==Comparison of U.S. law enforcement radiotelephony spelling alphabets==
The APCO radiotelephony spelling alphabet and its variations represent the letters of the English alphabet using words as follows:

There are several local variations of this system in use. The Metropolitan Police Department (Washington DC), uses the APCO alphabet, however the California Highway Patrol, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, San Jose Police Department, San Francisco Police Department, and other agencies across the West Coast and Southwestern United States, use versions that allocate &quot;Yellow&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; and other agencies&#x27; versions allocate &quot;Baker&quot; or &quot;Bravo&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, or use variations that include &quot;Nancy&quot; instead of &quot;Nora&quot; for &quot;N&quot;, &quot;Easy&quot; instead of &quot;Edward&quot; for &quot;E&quot;, or &quot;Yesterday&quot; for &quot;Y&quot;.

With the ultimate goal of clarity, especially in circumstances where signals can be garbled, the use of the word &quot;Ocean&quot; seems to be advantageous in the radio communication of the letter &quot;O&quot; because it begins with the long, clear vowel &quot;O&quot;. The phonetic words &quot;Ida&quot; and &quot;Union&quot; feature this same advantage. However, spelling alphabets seem to rarely use initial long vowels. With the exception of &quot;Uniform&quot;, none of the initial vowels in the NATO alphabet is like this. In an earlier U.S. military alphabet, &quot;A&quot; was indicated by &quot;Able&quot;, which does start with a long &quot;A&quot;, but has since been changed to &quot;Alpha&quot; (also spelled &quot;Alfa&quot;, particularly outside the English-speaking countries). In like manner, for clarity, the use of &quot;niner&quot; instead of &quot;nine&quot; for the numeral 9 prevents confusion with the numeral 5, which can sound similar, especially when communications are garbled.

==Popular culture==
The origin of the name Adam-12 from the television series of the same title comes from this alphabet. The LAPD still calls its basic two-man patrol car an &quot;A&quot; unit, and the letter &quot;A&quot; is spoken as &quot;Adam&quot; in the spelling alphabet. The entire callsign &quot;1-Adam-12&quot; translates to [Division] One (LAPD Central Division) Two Man Patrol Car (Adam unit) in patrol car 12. The 12 refers to what is called &quot;The Basic Car Plan&quot;. That is, the patrol area within the precinct. Specialized units use the last numbers as designating the officers. An example would be 6U2, Hollywood Division report writing unit. The patrol car, in LAPD jargon, is called a &quot;black-and-white&quot;, owing to the colors. The number that is on the car is called the shop number and is only used for identifying the vehicle.

In the American television series &quot;CHiPs&quot; from 1977 to 1983, motorcycle units are identified with the letter &quot;M&quot;, such as 7M4 (Seven Mary Four) for Officer Frank Poncherello (portrayed by Erik Estrada). His partner, Officer Jon Baker (portrayed by actor Larry Wilcox), is identified as 7M3 (Seven Mary Three). In these callsigns, &quot;7&quot; designates the patrol beat, &quot;M&quot; designates a motorcycle unit, and &quot;3&quot; is the unit number.

&quot;Hunter&quot; from 1984 to 1991 had actor Fred Dryer as Rick Hunter identify as &quot;1 William 1 Paul 156&quot; as his call sign where W is &quot;William&quot; and P is &quot;Paul&quot; when he was with the LAPD.

Also, since many police, fire department, and rescue squad TV programs and movies are set in Los Angeles, the words of the LAPD phonetic alphabet have become familiar in the United States, Canada and English-speaking countries around the world due to the wide reach of American entertainment media. When used by workers such as telephone operators speaking to &quot;civilians&quot; who may be unfamiliar with the use of a phonetic alphabet, both the everyday letter and its phonetic alphabet equivalent are spoken, such as &quot;B as in boy&quot;, &quot;V as in Victor&quot;, etc.

On early seasons of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, a close variant of the LAPD phonetic alphabet was used. Players would be encouraged to say things like &quot;I&#x27;ll have B as in boy&quot; when choosing letters.

<doc id="240400" wikidata="Q1309976" url="?curid=240400" title="Concentration of media ownership">
<text>Concentration of media ownership, also known as media consolidation or media convergence, is a process wherein fewer individuals or organizations control shares of the mass media. Research in the 1990s and early 2000s suggested then-increasing levels of consolidation, with many media industries already highly concentrated where a few companies own much of the market. However, since the proliferation of the Internet, smaller and more diverse new media companies maintain a larger share of the overall market.

Globally, some of the largest media conglomerates include Bertelsmann, National Amusements (Paramount Global), Sony Group Corporation, News Corp, Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Discovery, Fox Corporation, Hearst Communications, Amazon (Amazon MGM Studios), Grupo Globo (South America), and Lagardère Group.

As of 2022, the largest media conglomerates in terms of revenue are Comcast NBCUniversal, The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Paramount Global.

==Mergers==
Media mergers occur when one media company buys another. In 2008, Joseph Straubhaar, Robert LaRose and Lucinda Davenport described the landscape of corporate media ownership in the United States of America as an oligopoly.

=== Risks for media integrity ===
Some believe media integrity to be at risk when ownership of the media market is concentrated. Media integrity refers to the ability of a media outlet to serve the public interest and democratic process, making it resilient to institutional corruption within the media system, economy of influence, conflicting dependence and political clientelism.

=== Elimination of net neutrality ===
Net neutrality is also at stake when media mergers occur. Net neutrality involves a lack of restrictions on content on the internet, however, with big businesses supporting campaigns financially they tend to have influence over political issues, which can translate into their mediums. These big businesses, that also have control over internet usage or the airwaves, could possibly make the content available biased from their political stand point, or they could restrict usage for conflicting political views, therefore eliminating net neutrality.

==Issues==
Concentration of media ownership is very frequently seen as a problem of contemporary media and society.

=== Freedom of the press and editorial independence ===
Johannes von Dohnanyi, in a 2003 report published by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)&#x27;s Office of the Representative on Freedom of the Media, argued market concentration among media—whether driven by domestic or foreign investors—should be &quot;closely monitored&quot; because &quot;Horizontal concentration may cause dangers to media pluralism and diversity, while vertical concentration may result in entry barriers for new competitors.&quot; Von Dohnanyi argues that to &quot;safeguard free and independent print media and protect professional journalism as one of the cornerstones of constitutional democracy&quot; there should be standards for editorial independence, better labor protections for professional journalists, and independent institutions &quot;to monitor the implementation and observance of all laws and regulations regarding concentration processes, media pluralism, content diversity and journalistic freedoms.&quot;

=== Deregulation ===
Robert W. McChesney argues that the concentration of media ownership is caused by a shift to neoliberal deregulation policies, which is a market-driven approach. Deregulation effectively removes governmental barriers to allow for the commercial exploitation of media. Motivation for media firms to merge includes increased profit-margins, reduced risk and maintaining a competitive edge. In contrast to this, those who support deregulation have argued that cultural trade barriers and regulations harm consumers and domestic support in the form of subsidies hinders countries to develop their own strong media firms. The opening of borders is more beneficial to countries than maintaining protectionist regulations.

Critics of media deregulation and the resulting concentration of ownership fear that such trends will only continue to reduce the diversity of information provided, as well as to reduce the accountability of information providers to the public. The ultimate consequence of consolidation, critics argue, is a poorly informed public, restricted to a reduced array of media options that offer only information that does not harm the media oligopoly&#x27;s growing range of interests.

For those critics, media deregulation is a dangerous trend, facilitating an increase in concentration of media ownership, and subsequently reducing the overall quality and diversity of information communicated through major media channels. Increased concentration of media ownership can lead to corporate censorship affecting a wide range of critical thought.

== Media pluralism ==

The concentration of media ownership is commonly regarded as one of the crucial aspects reducing media pluralism. A high concentration of the media market increases the chances to reduce the plurality of political, cultural and social points of views.
Even if ownership of the media is one of the main concerns when it comes to assessing media pluralism, the concept of media pluralism is broader as it touches many aspects, from merger control rules to editorial freedom, the status of public service broadcasters, the working conditions of journalists, the relationship between media and politics, representation of local and regional communities and the inclusion of minorities&#x27; voices. Also, it embraces all measures guaranteeing citizens&#x27; access to diversified sources so to allow the formation of a plurality of opinions in the public sphere without undue influence of dominant powers.

Furthermore, media pluralism has a two-fold dimension, or rather internal and external. Internal pluralism concerns pluralism within a specific media organisation: in this regard, many countries request public broadcast services to account for a variety of views and opinions, including those of minority groups. External pluralism applies instead to the overall media landscape, for instance in terms of the number of media outlets operating in a given country.

Media ownership can pose serious challenges to pluralism when owners interfere with journalists&#x27; independence and editorial line. However, in a free market economy, owners must have the capacity to decide the strategy of their company to remain competitive in the market. Also, pluralism does not mean neutrality and lack of opinion, as having an editorial line is an integral part of the role of editors provided that this line is transparent and explicit to both the staff and audience.

=== Determinants of media pluralism ===

====Size and wealth of the market====
&quot;Within any free market economy, the level of resources available for the provision of media will be constrained principally by the size and wealth of that economy, and the propensity of its inhabitants to consume media.&quot; [Gillian Doyle; 2002:15] Those countries that have a relatively large market, like the United Kingdom, France or Spain have more financial background to support diversity of output and have the ability to keep more media companies in the market (as they are there to make profit). More diverse output and fragmented ownership will support pluralism. In contrast, small markets like Ireland or Hungary suffer from the absence of the diversity of output given in countries with bigger markets. It means that &quot;support for the media through direct payment&quot; and &quot;levels of consumers expenditure&quot;, furthermore &quot;the availability of advertising support&quot; [Gillian Doyle; 2002:15] are less in these countries, due to the low number of audience. Overall, the size and wealth of the market determine the diversity of both media output and media ownership.

====Consolidation of resources====
The consolidation of cost functions and cost-sharing. Cost-sharing is a common practice in monomedia and cross media. For example, &quot;for multi-product television or radio broadcasters, the more homogeneity possible between different services held in common ownership (or the more elements within a programme schedule which can be shared between &#x27;different&#x27; stations), the greater the opportunity to reap economies&quot;. Though the main concern of pluralism is that different organization under different ownership may buy the same e.g. news stories from the same news-supplier agency. In the UK, the biggest news-supplier is The Press Association (PA). Here is a quoted text from PA web site: &quot;The Press Association supplies services to every national and regional daily newspaper, major broadcasters, online publishers and a wide range of commercial organisations.&quot; Overall, in a system where all different media organizations gather their stories from the same source, we can&#x27;t really call that system pluralist. That is where diversity of output comes in.

=== Pluralism in media ownership ===
Media privatization and the lessening of state dominance over media content has continued since 2012. In the Arab region, the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ASBU) counted 1,230 television stations broadcasting via Arab and international satellites, of which 133 were state-owned and 1,097 private. According to the ASBU Report, these numbers serve as evidence of a decline in the percentage of state channels and a rise in national private and foreign public stations targeting the Arab region. The reduction of direct government ownership over the whole media sector is commonly registered as a positive trend, but this has paralleled by a growth in outlets with a sectarian agenda.

In Africa, some private media outlets have maintained close ties to governments or individual politicians, while media houses owned by politically non-aligned individuals have struggled to survive, often in the face of advertising boycotts by state agencies. In almost all regions, models of public service broadcasting have been struggling for funding. In Western, Central and Eastern Europe, funds directed to public service broadcasting have been stagnating or declining since 2012.

New types of cross-ownership have emerged in the past five years that have spurred new questions about where to draw the line between media and other industries. A notable case has been the acquisition of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; by the founder of online retailer Amazon. While the move initially raised concerns about the newspaper&#x27;s independence, the newspaper has significantly increased its standing in the online media—and print—and introduced significant innovations.

The community-centred media ownership model continues to survive in some areas, especially in isolated, rural or disadvantaged areas, and mostly pertaining to radio. Through this model, not-for-profit media outlets are run and managed by the communities they serve.

===Australia===
Controls over media ownership in Australia are laid down in the &quot;Broadcasting Services Act 1992&quot;, administered by the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority (ACMA). Even with laws in place Australia has a high concentration of media ownership. Ownership of national newspapers and those of each capital city are dominated by News Corp Australia and Nine Entertainment. Although much of the everyday mainstream news is drawn from the Australian Associated Press, all the privately owned media outlets still compete with each other for exclusive pop culture news.

Rural and regional media is dominated by Australian Community Media, with significant holdings in all states and territories.
Daily Mail &amp; General Trust operate the Nova Entertainment commercial radio networks in metropolitan and regional areas of Australia. Formed in 1996, it has since become one of the largest radio media companies in the country. The company currently own more than 60 radio stations across New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.

There are rules governing foreign ownership of Australian media and these rules were loosened by the Howard government.

&quot;Media Watch&quot; is an independent media watchdog televised on the public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which is one of two government-administered channels, the other being Special Broadcasting Service (SBS).

In late 2011, the Finkelstein Inquiry into media regulation was launched, and reported its findings back to the federal government in early 2012.

===New Zealand===

Independent Newspapers Limited (INL) formerly published the Wellington-based newspapers The Dominion and The Evening Post, in addition to purchasing a large shareholding in pay TV broadcaster Sky Media Limited in 1997. These two newspapers merged to form the Dominion Post in 2002, and in 2003, sold its entire print media division to Fairfax New Zealand. The remainder of the company officially merged with Sky Media Limited in 2005 to form Sky Network Television Limited.

When INL ceased publishing the &quot;Auckland Star&quot; in 1991, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; became the Auckland region&#x27;s sole daily newspaper. The &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; and the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot;, formerly privately held by the Wilson &amp; Horton families, was sold to APN News &amp; Media in 1996. The long-running news syndication agency NZPA announced that it would close down in 2011, with operations to be taken over by 3 separate agencies, APN&#x27;s APNZ, Fairfax&#x27;s FNZN and AAP&#x27;s NZN, all owned by Australian parent companies. In 2014, APN&#x27;s New Zealand division officially changed its name to NZME, in order to reflect the company&#x27;s convergence with its radio division The Radio Network. As of early 2015, Fairfax New Zealand and NZME have a near duopoly on newspapers and magazines in New Zealand. In May 2016, NZME and Fairfax NZ announced merger talks, pending Commerce Commission approval. The merger was abandoned in 2018 following a Court of Appeal ruling that judged that the &quot;detriments clearly outweigh benefits, and not by a small margin&quot;.

Commercial radio stations are largely divided up between MediaWorks New Zealand and NZME. MediaWorks&#x27; TV division, which includes TV3 and C4 (now The Edge TV), were purchased by Discovery Networks in 2020. Television New Zealand, although 100% state-owned, has been run on an almost entirely commercial basis since the late 1980s, in spite of previous attempts to steer it towards a more public service-oriented role. Its primary public-service outlet, TVNZ7, ceased broadcasting in 2012 due to non-renewal of funding, and the youth-oriented TVNZ6 was rebranded as the short-lived commercial channel TVNZ U. In addition, the now-defunct TVNZ channels Kidzone and TVNZ Heartland) were only available through Sky Network Television and not on the Freeview platform.

Sky Network Television has had an effective monopoly on pay TV in New Zealand since its nearest rival Saturn Communications (later part of TelstraClear and now Vodafone New Zealand) began wholesaling Sky content in 2002. However, in 2011, TelstraClear CEO Allan Freeth warned it would review its wholesale agreement with Sky unless it allowed TelstraClear to purchase non-Sky content.

===Canada===

Canada has the biggest concentrated TV ownership out of all the G8 countries and it comes in second place for the most concentrated television viewers.

Broadcasting and telecommunications in Canada are regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), an independent governing agency that aims to serve the needs and interests of citizens, industries, interest groups and the government. The CRTC does not regulate newspapers or magazines.

Apart from a relatively small number of community broadcasters, media in Canada are primarily owned by a small number of groups, including Bell Canada, the Shaw family (via Corus Entertainment and Shaw Communications), Rogers Communications, Quebecor, and the government-owned CBC/Radio-Canada. Each of these companies holds a diverse mix of television, specialty television, and radio operations. Bell, Rogers, Shaw, and Quebecor also engage in the telecommunications industry with their ownership of internet providers, television providers, and mobile carriers, while Rogers is also involved in publishing.

In 2007, CTVglobemedia, Rogers Media and Quebecor all expanded significantly through the acquisitions of CHUM Limited, CityTV and Osprey Media, respectively. In 2010, Canwest Global Communications, having filed for bankruptcy, sold its television assets to Shaw (through a new subsidiary, Shaw Media) and spun off its newspaper holdings into Postmedia Network, a new company founded by the &quot;National Post&quot;&#x27;s CEO Paul Godfrey. Later that year, Bell also announced that it would acquire the remaining shares of CTVglobemedia (which was originally majority owned by Bell when it was formed in 2001; Bell had reduced its stake in the following years), forming Bell Media.

Between 1990 and 2005 there were a number of media corporate mergers and takeovers in Canada. For example, in 1990, 17.3% of daily newspapers were independently owned; whereas in 2005, 1% were. These changes, among others, caused the Senate Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to launch a study of Canadian news media in March 2003. (This topic had been examined twice in the past, by the Davey Commission (1970) and the Kent Commission (1981), both of which produced recommendations that were never implemented in any meaningful way.)

The Senate Committee&#x27;s final report, released in June 2006, expressed concern about the effects of the current levels of news media ownership in Canada. Specifically, the committee discussed their concerns regarding the following trends: the potential of media ownership concentration to limit news diversity and reduce news quality; the CRTC and Competition Bureau&#x27;s ineffectiveness at stopping media ownership concentration; the lack of federal funding for the CBC and the broadcaster&#x27;s uncertain mandate and role; diminishing employment standards for journalists (including less job security, less journalistic freedom, and new contractual threats to intellectual property); a lack of Canadian training and research institutes; and difficulties with the federal government&#x27;s support for print media and the absence of funding for the internet-based news media.

The Senate report expressed particular concern about the concentration of ownership in the province of New Brunswick, where the Irving business empire owns all the English-language daily newspapers and most of the weeklies. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the report, stated, &quot;We didn&#x27;t find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick.&quot;

The report provided 40 recommendations and 10 suggestions (for areas outside of federal government jurisdiction), including legislation amendments that would trigger automatic reviews of a proposed media merger if certain thresholds are reached, and CRTC regulation revisions to ensure that access to the broadcasting system is encouraged and that a diversity of news and information programming is available through these services.

Public inquires into the concentration of ownership and its impact upon democracy. The Canadian regulatory framework imposes requirements upon the protection and enhancement of Canadian culture (through regulation, subsidies and the operation of the CBC). Increasing acceptance of media/news as commercial enterprise in 1990s driven by: hegemony of new-liberalism, role of commodified information technology in economic growth, commitment to private sector &quot;champions&quot; of Canadian culture.

===Brazil===

In Brazil, the concentration of media ownership seems to have manifested itself very early. Dr. Venício A. de Lima noted in 2003:

Lima points to other factors that would make media concentration easier, particularly in broadcasting: the failure of legal norms that limit the equity interest of the same economic group in various broadcasting organizations; a short period (five years) for resell broadcasting concessions, facilitating the concentration by the big media groups through the purchase of independent stations, and no restrictions to the formation of national broadcasting networks. He cites examples of horizontal, vertical, crossed and &quot;in cross&quot; concentration (a Brazilian peculiarity).
* Horizontal concentration: oligopoly or monopoly produced within an area or industry; television (pay or free) is the Brazilian classical model. In 2002 the cable networks Sky and NET dominated 61% of the Brazilian market. In the same year, 58.37% of all advertising budgets were invested in TV – and in this aspect, TV Globo and its affiliates received 78% of the amount.
* Vertical concentration: integration of the different phases of production and distribution, eliminating the work of independent producers. In Brazil, unlike the United States, it is common for a TV network to produce, advertise, market and distribute most of its programming. TV Globo is known for its soap operas exported to dozens of countries; it keeps under permanent contract the actors, authors, and the whole production staff. The final product is broadcast by a network of newspapers, magazines, radio stations and websites owned by Globo Organizations.
* Cross ownership: ownership of different kinds of media (TV, newspapers, magazines, etc.) by the same group. Initially, the phenomenon occurred in radio, television and print media, with emphasis on the group of &quot;Diários Associados.&quot; At a later stage appeared the RBS Group (affiliated to TV Globo), with operations in the markets of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Besides being the owner of radio and television stations, and of the main local newspapers, it has two Internet portals. The opinions of its commentators are thus replicated by a multimedia system that makes it extremely easy to spread the point of view advocated by the group.
* Monopoly &quot;in cross&quot;: reproduction into local level, of the particularities of cross ownership. Research carried out in the early 1990s, detected the presence of this singularity in 18 of the 26 Brazilian states. Manifests itself by the presence of a TV channel with a large audience, often linked to TV Globo and by the existence of two daily newspapers, in which the one with the largest circulation is linked to the major television channel and to a network of radio stations, that almost always reproduces articles and the editorial line of the newspaper &quot;O Globo&quot;. In 2002, another survey (which did not include pay TV), found the presence of the &quot;monopoly in cross&quot; in 13 major markets in Brazil.

The UNESCO office in Brasília has expressed its concern over the existence of an outdated code of telecommunications (1962), which no longer meets the expectations generated by the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 in the political and social fields, and the inability of the Brazilian government to establish an independent regulatory agency to manage the media. Attempts in this direction have been pointed by the mainstream media as attacks on freedom of expression, the trend of the political left in the entire Latin American continent.

===Europe===

====Council of Europe and European Union====

Since the 1980s, a significant debate has developed at the European level concerning the regulation of media ownership and the principles to be adopted to regulate media ownership concentration. Both the Council of Europe (CoE) and the European Union (EU) have tried to formulate a distinctive and comprehensive media policy, including on the issue of concentration. However, the emphasis of both the organisations was more on strengthening media diversity and pluralism than on limiting concentration, even though they have often expressed the need for common European media concentration regulations. However, the European Union enforces a common regulation for environmental protection, consumer protection and human rights, but it has none for media pluralism.

Although there is no specific media concentration legislation at the European level, a number of existing legal instruments such as the Amsterdam Protocol, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and actions programs contribute directly and indirectly to curbing media concentration at EU level.

When it comes to regulating media concentration at the common European level, there is a conflict between Member states and the European Commission (EC). Even if Member states do not publicly challenge the need for common regulation on media concentration, they push to incorporate their own regulatory approach at the EU level and are reluctant to give the European Union their regulatory power on the issue of media concentration.

The Council of Europe&#x27;s initiative promoting media pluralism and curbing media concentration dates back to the mid-1970s. Several resolutions, recommendations, declarations by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers and studies by experts&#x27; groups have addressed the issue since then. The council&#x27;s approach has been mainly addressed at defining and protecting media pluralism, defined in terms of pluralism of media content in order to allow a plurality of ideas and opinions.

Within the European Union, two main standpoints have emerged in the debate: on the one hand, the European Parliament has favoured the idea that, considering the crucial role that media play in the functioning of democratic systems, policies in this field should prevent excessive concentration in order to guarantee pluralism and diversity. On the other hand, the European Commission has privileged the understanding that the media sector should be regulated, as any other economic field, following the principles of market harmonization and liberalization.

Indeed, media concentration issues can be addressed both by general competition policies and by specific media sector rules. According to some scholars, given the vital importance of contemporary media, sector-specific competition rules in the media industries should be enhanced. Within the EU, the Council regulation 4064/89/EEC on the control of concentrations between undertakings as part of European competition legislation covered also media concentration cases. The need for sector-specific regulation has been widely supported by both media scholars and the European Parliament. In the 1980s, when preparing legislation on cross-border television many experts and MEPs argued for including provisions for media concentration in the EU directive but these efforts failed. In 1992, the Commission of the European Communities published a policy document named &quot;Pluralism and Media Concentration in the internal Market – an assessment of the need for Community action&quot; which outlined three options on the issue of media concentration regulation at the Community level, i.e. no specific action to be taken; action regulating transparency; and action to harmonize laws. Out of these options, the first one was chosen but the debate on this decision lasted for years. Council regulation as a tool for regulating media concentration was excluded and the two proposals on a media concentration directive advanced in the mid 1990s were not backed by the commission. As a consequence, efforts at legislating media concentration at Community level were phased out by the end of the 1990s.

Despite a wide consensus over the idea that the vital importance of contemporary media justifies to regulate media concentration through sector-specific concentration rules going beyond the general competition policy, the need for sector specific regulation has been challenged in recent years due to the peculiar evolution of the media industry in the digital environment and media convergence. In practice, sector-specific media concentration rules have been abolished in some European countries in recent years.

As a consequence, scholars Harcourt and Picard argue that &quot;the trend has been to remove ownership rules and restrictions on media ownership within Europe in order that &#x27;domestic champions&#x27; can bulk up to &#x27;fend off&#x27; the US threat. This has been a key argument for the loosening of ownership rules within Europe.&quot;

In 2002, the European Parliament tried to revitalize the efforts on regulating media concentration at the European level and adopted a resolution on media concentration which called on the European Commission to launch a broad and comprehensive consultation on media pluralism and media concentration and to prepare a Green Paper on the issue by the end of 2003. The European Commission failed to meet this deadline. In the following years, during the process of amending the Televisions Without Frontiers directive, which was adopted by the EP and the Council in 2007, the issue of media concentration was discussed, but it did not represent the core of the debate. In 2003, the European Commission issued a policy document named &quot;The future of European Regulatory Audiovisual Policy&quot; which stressed that, in order to ensure media pluralism, measures should aim at limiting the level of media concentration by establishing &quot;maximum holdings in media companies and prevent[ing] cumulative control or participation in several media companies at the same time&quot;.

In 2007, reacting to concerns on media concentration and its repercussion on pluralism and freedom of expression in the EU member states raised by the European Parliament and by NGOs, the European Commission launched a new three-phase plan on media pluralism

In October 2009, a European Union Directive was proposed to set for all member states common and higher standards for media pluralism and freedom of expression. The proposal was put to a vote in the European Parliament and rejected by just three votes. The directive was supported by the liberal-centrists, the progressives and the greens, and was opposed by the European People&#x27;s Party. Unexpectedly, the Irish liberals made an exception by voting against the directive, and later revealed that they had been pressured by the Irish right-wing government to do so.

Following this debate, the European Commission commissioned a large, in depth study published in 2009 aiming to identify the indicators to be adopted to assess media pluralism in Europe.

The &quot;Independent Study on Indicators for Media Pluralism in the Member States – Towards a Risk-Based Approach&quot; provided a prototype of indicators and country reports for 27 EU member states. After years of refining and preliminary testings, the study resulted in the Media Pluralism Monitor (MPM), a yearly monitoring carried out by the Centre for Media Pluralism and Freedom at the European University Institute in Florence on a variety of aspects affecting media pluralism, including also the concentration of media ownership is considered. To assess the risk that media ownership concentration in a given country may actually hinder media pluralism, the MPM takes into account three specific elements:
* Horizontal concentration, that is concentration of media ownership within a given media sector (press, audio-visual, etc.);
* Cross-media concentration across different media markets;
* Transparency of media ownership.

In 2015, the MPM was carried out in 19 European countries. The results of the monitoring activity in the field of media market concentration identify five countries as facing a high risk: Finland, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Poland and Spain. There are nine countries facing a medium risk: Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Sweden. Finally, only five countries face a low risk: Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia. In the monitoring carried out in 2014, 7 of 9 countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, the UK) scored a high risk in audience concentration.

====Pan-European groups====

A 2016 report based on data collected by MAVISE, a free online database on audiovisual services and companies in Europe, highlights the growing number of Pan-European media companies in the field of broadcasting and divides them into different categories: multi‐country media groups, controlling &quot;channels that play an important role in various national markets (for example Modern Times Group, CME, RTL, a Luxembourg-based media group operating in 10 countries, and Sanoma). These groups generally control a high market share in the countries in which they operate, and have gradually emerged through the acquisition of existing channels or by establishing new companies in countries in which they were not already present. The four groups RTL Group, CME, Modern Times Group and Sanoma are major players (in the top 4 regarding audience share) in 19 European countries (RTL Group, CME and Modern Times Group are major players in 17 countries). Pan‐European broadcasters operate with a unique identity and well recognized brands across Europe. Most of them are based in the United States and have progressively expanded their activities in the European market. In many cases, these groups evolved from being content creators to also deliver such contents through channels renamed after the original brands.

Examples of such pan-European groups include Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Global, and The Walt Disney Company, pan‐European distribution groups (cable and satellite operators), companies that operate at the European level in the distribution sector via cable, satellite or IPTV. The emergence of major actors operating in this field has been made possible mainly thanks to the process of digitalization and benefit of specific economies of scale.

====EU Member States====
=====Czech Republic=====
In the Czech Republic about 80% of the newspapers and magazines were owned by German and Swiss corporations in 2007, as the two main press groups Vltava Labe Media and Mafra were (completely or partly) controlled by the German group Rheinisch-Bergische Druckerei- und Verlagsgesellschaft (Mediengruppe Rheinische Post), but were both later purchased by Czech-owned conglomerates Penta Investments and Agrofert in 2015 and 2013 respectively. Several major media previously owned by Swiss company Ringier became Czech-owned through their acquisition by the Czech News Center in 2013.
* Vltava Labe Media, a subsidiary of Penta Investments, that owns the tabloids &quot;ŠÍP&quot; and &quot;ŠÍP EXTRA&quot;, 73 regional dailies &quot;Deník&quot; and other 26 weeklies and that is major shareholder of publishing houses &quot;Astrosat&quot; and &quot;Melinor&quot; and 100% owner of &quot;Metropol&quot; and also partly controls the distribution of all the prints through &quot;PNS, a.s.&quot; which was previously part of the German &quot;&quot; (that controls also the German &quot;Neue Presse Verlags&quot;, the Polish &quot;Polskapresse&quot; and the Slovak &quot;Petit Press&quot;).
* Mafra, a subsidiary of Kaprain Chemical (that owns the centre-right dailies &quot;Dnes&quot;, &quot;Lidové noviny&quot;, the local edition of the freesheet &quot;Metro&quot;, the periodical &quot;14dní&quot;, several monthly magazines, the TV music channel &quot;Óčko&quot;, the radio stations &quot;Expresradio&quot; and &quot;Rádio Classic FM&quot;, several web portals and partly controls, together with &quot;Vltava-Labe-Press&quot; and &quot;Czech News Center&quot;, the distribution company &quot;PNS&quot;) was previously owned by Agrofert, prior to its acquisition by Cyprus-registered Kaprain.
* Czech News Center controls 16 Czech daily tabloids and weeklies (such as &quot;24 hodin&quot;, &quot;Abc&quot;, &quot;Aha!&quot;, &quot;Blesk&quot;, &quot;Blesk TV Magazin&quot;, &quot;Blesk pro ženy&quot;, &quot;Blesk Hobby&quot;, &quot;Blesk Zdravi&quot;, &quot;Nedělní Blesk&quot;, &quot;Nedělní Sport&quot;, &quot;Reflex&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;Sport Magazin&quot;) as well as 7 web portals, reaching approximately 3.2 million readers.

Czech governments have defended foreign newspaper ownership as a manifestation of the principle of the free movement of capital.

The weekly &quot;Respekt&quot; is published by &quot;Respekt Media&quot;. The national television market is dominated by four terrestrial stations, two public (Czech TV1 and Czech TV2) and two private (NOVA TV and Prima TV), which draw 95% of audience share. Concerning the diversity of output, this is limited by a series of factors: the average low level of professional education among Czech journalists is compensated by &quot;informal professionalization&quot;, leading to a degree of conformity in approaches; political parties hold strong ties in Czech media, especially print, where more than 50% of Czech journalists identify with the Right, while only 16% express sympathy for the Left; and the process of commercialization and &quot;tabloidization&quot; has increased, lowering differentiation of content in Czech print media.

=====Germany=====
Axel Springer AG is one of the largest newspaper publishing companies in Europe, claiming to have over 150 newspapers and magazines in over 30 countries in Europe. In the 1960s and 1970s the company&#x27;s media followed an aggressive conservative policy (see Springerpresse). It publishes Germany&#x27;s only nationwide tabloid, &quot;Bild&quot;, and one of Germany&#x27;s most important broadsheets, &quot;Die Welt&quot;. Axel Springer also owns a number of regional newspapers, especially in Saxony and in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, giving the company a de facto monopoly in the latter case. An attempt to buy one of Germany&#x27;s two major private TV Groups, ProSiebenSat.1, in 2006, was withdrawn due to large concerns by regulation authorities as well as by parts of the public. The company is also active in Hungary, where it is the biggest publisher of regional newspapers, and in Poland, where it owns the best-selling tabloid &quot;Fakt&quot;, one of the nation&#x27;s most important broadsheets, &quot;Dziennik&quot;, and is one of the biggest shareholder in the second-ranked private TV company, Polsat.

Bertelsmann is one of the world&#x27;s largest media companies. It owns RTL Group, which is one of the two major private TV companies in both Germany and the Netherlands and also owning assets in Belgium, France, UK, Spain, Czech and Hungary. Bertelsmann also owns Gruner + Jahr, Germany&#x27;s biggest popular magazine publisher, including popular news magazine &quot;Stern&quot; and a 26% share in investigative news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. Bertelsmann also owns Random House, a book publisher, ranked first in the English-speaking world and second in Germany.

=====Greece=====

=====Ireland=====
In Ireland, the company Independent News &amp; Media owns many national newspapers: the &quot;Evening Herald&quot;, &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday World&quot; and &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot;. It also owns 29.9% of the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;. Broadcast media is divided between state owned RTÉ, which operates several radio stations and television channels and started digital radio and television services in the early 2010s, TG4, an Irish language broadcaster, and TV3, a commercial television operator. Denis O&#x27;Brien an Irish billionaire with a fortune partly accumulated through the Esat Digifone licence controversy, formed Communicorp Group Ltd in 1989, with the company currently owning 42 radio stations in 8 European countries, including Ireland&#x27;s Newstalk, Today FM, Dublin&#x27;s 98FM, SPIN 1038 and SPIN South West. In January 2006, O&#x27;Brien took a stake in Tony O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Independent News &amp; Media (IN&amp;M). As of May 2012, he holds a 29.9% stake in the company, making him the largest shareholder; the O&#x27;Reilly family&#x27;s stake is around 13%.

=====Italy=====

Silvio Berlusconi, the former Prime Minister of Italy, is the major shareholder of – by far – Italy&#x27;s biggest (and de facto only) private free TV company, Mediaset; Italy&#x27;s biggest publisher, Mondadori; and Italy&#x27;s biggest advertising company, . One of Italy&#x27;s nationwide dailies, &quot;Il Giornale&quot;, is owned by his brother, Paolo Berlusconi, and another, &quot;Il Foglio&quot;, by his former wife, Veronica Lario. Berlusconi has often been criticized for using the media assets he owns to advance his political career.
=====Latvia=====

====Belarus====
====Slovenia====

====United Kingdom====
In Britain and Ireland, Rupert Murdoch owns best-selling tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot; as well as the broadsheet &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, in addition having also owned 39% of satellite broadcasting network BSkyB. In March 2011, the United Kingdom provisionally approved Murdoch to buy the remaining 61% of BSkyB; however, subsequent events (&quot;News of the World&quot; hacking scandal and its closure in July 2011) leading to the Leveson Inquiry have halted this takeover. In 2019, despite the British government granting formal permission for a new take over of Sky (conditional on the divestiture of Sky News), Fox were outbid by American conglomerate Comcast.

Reach own five major national titles, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Sunday People&quot;, and the Scottish &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Record&quot; as well as over 100 regional newspapers. They claim to have a monthly digital reach of 73 million people. They also own &quot;OK! magazine&quot;, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Star&quot; 

after they were acquired by Reach from Richard Desmond Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) own the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, &quot;Ireland on Sunday&quot;, and free London daily &quot;Metro&quot;, and control a large proportion of regional media, including through subsidiary Northcliffe Media, in addition to large shares in ITN and formerly GCap Media before it became Global Radio.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; is owned by Guardian Media Group.

Richard Desmond used to own &quot;OK! magazine&quot;, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Star&quot;. They were sold to Reach plc in 2018. He used to own Channel 5; on 1 May 2014 the channel was acquired by Viacom for £450 million (US$759 million).

The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and former print publication &quot;The Independent&quot; are both partly owned by British-Russian media boss Evgeny Lebedev.

BBC News produces news for its television channels and radio stations.

Independent Television News produces news for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.

Independent Radio News, which has a contract with Sky News, produces news for the most popular commercial radio stations. However this has changed somewhat since the mid 2010s as many of the most popular commercial stations are owned by Global who produce their own news service, most notably for LBC and LBC News but also for Capital FM, Heart, Smooth, Gold, Radio X, Capital Xtra, Classic FM and others. National and local radio station ownership is dominated by the aforementioned Global Media &amp; Entertainment as well as Bauer Media, News Broadcasting and the UK&#x27;s only public service radio broadcaster the BBC

===India===

In India a few political parties also own media organizations, for example the proprietors of Kalaignar TV are close aides of Tamil Nadu&#x27;s former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. So is also the case with Sun TV. SRM university owner Pachamuthu, a member of Parliament, has stakes in Pudhiyathalaimurai News Channel. AMMK General Secretary TTV Dinakaran, MLA&#x27;s close aides run Jaya TV. 
Sakshi TV a Telugu channel in Andhra Pradesh is owned by ex-chief minister&#x27;s son and family.

===Israel===
In Israel, Arnon Mozes owns the most widespread Hebrew newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, the most widespread Russian newspaper Vesty, the most popular Hebrew news website Ynet, and 17% of the cable TV firm HOT. Moreover, Mozes owns the Reshet TV firm, which is one of the two operators of the most popular channel in Israel, Channel 2.

=== Mexico ===

In Mexico there are only two national broadcast television service companies, Televisa and Azteca. These two broadcasters together administer 434 of the 461 total commercial television stations in the country (94.14%).

Though concern about the existence of a duopoly had been around for some time, a press uproar sparked in 2006, when a controversial reform to the Federal Radio and Television Law, seriously hampered the entry of new competitors, like Cadena Tres.

Televisa also owns subscription TV enterprises and SKY, a publishing company , and the Televisa Radio broadcast radio network, creating a de facto media monopoly in many regions of the country.

===United States===
==== Recent media mergers in the United States ====
An infographic created by Jason at Frugal Dad states that in 1983, 90% of US media was controlled by 50 companies, and that in 2011, 90% was controlled by just 6 companies. One of the companies listed, News Corporation, was split into two separate companies on June 28, 2013, with publishing assets and Australian media assets going to News Corp and broadcasting and media assets going to 21st Century Fox.

==== Film industry ====
In the United States, movie production has been dominated by major studios since the early 20th century; before that, there was a period in which Edison&#x27;s Trust monopolized the industry. The music and television industries recently witnessed cases of media consolidation, with Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s parent company merging their music division with Bertelsmann AG&#x27;s BMG to form Sony BMG and Tribune&#x27;s The WB and CBS Corp.&#x27;s UPN merging to form The CW. In the case of Sony BMG, there existed a &quot;Big Five&quot; (now &quot;Big Four&quot;) of major record companies, while The CW&#x27;s creation was an attempt to consolidate ratings and stand up to the &quot;Big Four&quot; of American network (terrestrial) television (this despite the fact that the CW was, in fact, partially owned by one of the Big Four in CBS). In television, the vast majority of broadcast and basic cable networks, over a hundred in all, are controlled by seven corporations: Fox Corporation, The Walt Disney Company (which includes the ABC, ESPN, FX and Disney brands), National Amusements (which owns Paramount Global), Comcast (which owns NBCUniversal), Warner Bros. Discovery, the E. W. Scripps Company, Cablevision (now known as Altice USA), or some combination thereof.

There may also be some large-scale owners in an industry that are not the causes of monopoly or oligopoly. iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Communications), especially since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, acquired many radio stations across the United States, and came to own more than 1,200 stations. However, the radio broadcasting industry in the United States and elsewhere can be regarded as oligopolistic regardless of the existence of such a player. Because radio stations are local in reach, each licensing a specific part of spectrum from the FCC in a specific local area, any local market is served by a limited number of stations. In most countries, this system of licensing makes many markets local oligopolies. The similar market structure exists for television broadcasting, cable systems and newspaper industries, all of which are characterized by the existence of large-scale owners. Concentration of ownership is often found in these industries.

==== Effect of ownership on coverage ====
In a 2020 article, Herzog and Scerbinina argued that CNN&#x27;s coverage in 2017 of a potential merger between its parent company Time Warner and AT&amp;T was &quot;self-centered, self-promoting, and self-legitimizing.&quot;

=== Venezuela ===
About 70% of Venezuelan TV and radio stations are privately owned, while only about 5% or less of these stations are currently state-owned. The remaining stations are mostly community owned. VTV was the only state TV channel in Venezuela only about a decade ago. For the last decade, through the present day, the Venezuelan government operates and owns five more stations.

Commercial outlets completely rule over the radio sector. However, the Venezuelan government funds a good number of radio shows and TV stations. The primary newspapers of Venezuela are private companies that are frequently condemning of their government. These newspapers being produced in Venezuela do not have a large following.

<text>Romblon (, , ), officially the Province of Romblon, is an archipelagic province of the Philippines located in the Mimaropa region. Its main components include Romblon, an archipelagic municipality of the same name that also serves as the provincial capital; Tablas, the largest island, covering nine municipalities (including Odiongan, the largest municipality in the province); Sibuyan with its three towns; as well as the smaller island municipalities of Corcuera, Banton, Concepcion, and San Jose. The province lies south of Marinduque and Quezon, east of Oriental Mindoro, north of Aklan and Capiz, and west of Masbate. According to the 2020 census, it has a total population of 308,985.

Romblon was inhabited by aboriginal Filipinos prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1569. Archaeological artifacts recovered by the National Museum in 1936 indicate that the aborigines of Romblon have a rich and advanced culture. During the Spanish colonial rule, Romblon was initially administered under the province of Arevalo (Iloilo) until 1716, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly created province of Capiz. With arrival of the Americans in 1901, Romblon was declared a province and placed under civilian rule. It lost its provincial status for a short while between 1907 and 1945, but regained it in 1946, just after World War II.

The inhabitants of Romblon are divided into three ethnolinguistic groups: Romblomanon, Onhan and Asi. These groups occupy specific islands in the province and have their own language and customs. Romblomanon is mainly spoken in the town of Romblon, in all of three towns of Sibuyan Island, and the town of San Agustin in Tablas. Onhan is mainly spoken in the municipalities in the southern part of Tablas (Alcantara, Looc, Ferrol, Santa Fe, San Andres, and Santa Maria), as well as in the island municipality of San Jose. The northwestern part of Tablas Island (in Odiongan and Calatrava, as well as the islands municipalities of Corcuera, Banton, and Concepcion), speaks the Asi language.

The province relies on agriculture, particularly rice and copra farming as well as fishing, for its livelihood. It also has a lucrative marble industry due to an abundance of Italian-quality marble, hence, its moniker as the &quot;Marble Capital of the Philippines.&quot; The islands of the province have a number of white sand beaches, diving spots, mountains and rainforests that tourists visit. Sibuyan island is an ecotourism destination, having been dubbed by some as &quot;the Galápagos of Asia&quot; because it has remained in isolation from the rest of the world since its formation.

==Etymology==
According to legend, the name &quot;Romblon&quot; was derived from the Romblomanon word &quot;Nagalumyom&quot;, which pertains to a chicken in the act of sitting on its eggs on a nest. This eventually evolved to &quot;Lomlom&quot;, and later on to &quot;Donblon&quot;, the name reported by Spanish chronicler Miguel de Loarca in his book &quot;Relacion de las Islas Filipinas&quot; in 1582, before finally evolving to Romblon.

Meanwhile, local historians Roland Madeja and Evelyn Reyes relate the origin of the name &quot;Romblon&quot; to the shape of Romblon Island. Madeja claims that the name was derived from the Spanish word &quot;ronblon&quot;, another term for &quot;tornillo&quot;, meaning &quot;screw.&quot; According to him, the Spanish claimed to have observed the screw-like shape of Romblon Island. Meanwhile, Reyes claims Romblon originated from &quot;doubloon&quot;, which refers to the Spanish coin used by Moro pirates in paying dowries for their brides-to-be. The Spanish might have named the island after the shape of the coin.

==History==
===Early history===
Romblon&#x27;s aboriginal inhabitants were the Negritos from Panay and Mangyans from Mindoro, who settled in the islands during the precolonial period. Ancient wooden coffins discovered in the Guyangan Cave System of Banton Island in 1936 signify a rich ancient civilization and culture in the province before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1569. These artifacts are currently on display at the National Museum in Manila. Remnants of Negrito and Mangyan aborigines now live in the mountains of Tablas and Sibuyan after they were displaced by the influx of Hiligaynon, Aklanon, Bicolano and Tagalog migrants as early as 1870.

===Spanish colonial era===
According to historians Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, the Spanish arrived in Romblon in 1569 led by conquistador Martin de Goiti who was dispatched by Miguel López de Legazpi to explore the western and northern portion of the Visayas region including Romblon and Mindoro. The islands were later organized into three &quot;encomiendas&quot; and were administered from Arevalo. De Loarca visited Romblon in 1582 and conducted the first census of the islands.

In 1635, Augustinian Recollect missionaries arrived in Romblon to establish Catholic missions and settlements. They helped the Spanish authorities establish peace and order in the islands. In 1868, they established seven missionary centers at Romblon, Badajoz (San Agustin), Cajidiocan, Banton, Looc, Odiongan and Magallanes (Magdiwang). They also built massive forts, churches and watchtowers in the province, such as Fort San Jose in Banton and Fort San Andres in Romblon, following a Dutch attack in 1646 which destroyed the capital town and to repulse recurring Moro raids.

Romblon was separated from the jurisdiction of Arevalo and annexed to Capiz, when the province was created in 1716. More than a century later in 1850, the inhabitants of the province began using Spanish family names after governor-general Narciso Clavería decreed on 21 November 1849 the use of surnames from the &quot;Catálogo alfabético de apellidos&quot;. Asi-speaking natives were assigned the letter F, Romblomanon speakers were assigned the letter M, speakers of the Sibuyanon style of Romblomanon were assigned the letter R, while Onhan-speaking natives were assigned the letter G.

In 1853, the islands were organized into a politico-military &quot;comandancia&quot; (&quot;sub-province&quot; in English) administered from Capiz and continued to be so until the end of the Spanish rule in 1898. As a sub-province, Romblon was under an army officer with the rank of captain. The town of Romblon was its capital and the other municipalities were Azagra, Badajos (now San Agustin), Banton, Cajidiocan, Corcuera, Looc, Magallanes (now Magdiwang), Odiongan, Despujols (now San Andres) and Santa Fe.

====Philippine revolution====
In 1898, amid the Philippine Revolution, Katipunan leader Emilio Aguinaldo sent his generals to several provinces in the Visayas to expand the recognition of his revolutionary government in the central and southern Philippines. The Katipunan general Mariano Riego de Dios and his forces liberated Romblon, while generals Ananias Diocno and Leandro Fullon proceeded to Panay. On 25 July the same year, Riego de Dios took the Romblon capital and captured Spanish officials. Four days later, the Spanish politico-military governor Don Carlos Mendoza formally signed the surrender of Romblon&#x27;s district government, ending more than three hundred years of Spanish rule in the archipelagic province.

Later, Don Wenceslao Molo, a local from Romblon town, was appointed governor and became responsible for the collection of a total amount of , Romblon&#x27;s share to the war expenditures of the Revolutionary Government from 31 May 1898 to 28 February 1899. A local election was also held in Romblon town for its ministers of justice and barrio officials. However, Molo&#x27;s term was a brief transition to another era as the Americans arrived in the province a few months later.

===American colonial era===

Upon the restoration of peace and order in the province following the Philippine–American War, the Americans established civilian government in the islands on 16 March 1901. Romblon was created as a regular province in the same year but due to insufficient income, it became a sub-province of Capiz again from 15 July 1907 until 22 February 1918, when Act No. 2724 reestablished the province. Under Commonwealth Act No. 581, enacted without executive approval on 8 June 1940, the province was reorganized with four towns or municipalities, namely: Tablas (composed of Odiongan, Looc, and Badajoz), Romblon (including the islands of Logbon, Cobrador and Alad), Maghali (comprising Banton, Corcuera, and Concepcion), and Sibuyan (composed of the towns of Cajidiocan, Magdiwang and San Fernando).

===Japanese occupation era===
During World War II, the Japanese Imperial Forces established a garrison in Romblon on 21 March 1942 which they maintained until the end of the war. The islands became one of the centers of resistance movement against the Japanese. The movement was led by the Free Panay Guerilla Forces composed of members from the 6th Military District under the direction of Col. Macario Peralta, Jr. One of the major naval engagements during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Battle of Sibuyan Sea, happened off the waters of Romblon on 23–24 October 1944 between Japanese Admiral Kurita’s fleet from Singapore and Admiral Halsey&#x27;s carrier planes from the US Third Fleet then stationed east of the Philippines. Units from Company C of the 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division landed on Sawang, Romblon on the night 11 March 1945. By 18 March, the province was liberated from Japanese forces.

===Philippine independence===
On July 4, 1946, the United States relinquished sovereignty over the Philippines and recognized the Republic of the Philippines as a sovereign and independent nation with the signing of the &quot;Treaty of General Relations and Protocol&quot; by representatives of the United States and Republic of the Philippines.

On 1 October 1946, Congress passed Republic Act No. 38, sponsored by Cong. Modesto Formilleza, which abolished the four special municipalities and restored Romblon and its municipalities to its pre-war status. In the decades that followed, the province saw the creation of new municipalities, such as Alcantara (1961) from Looc, Calatrava (1969) from San Agustin, Ferrol (1978) from Odiongan, and Santa Maria (1984) from San Agustin.

Romblon, which is historically and geographically part of the Western Visayas Region, is made politically part of the Southern Tagalog Region (Region IV) in the gerrymandering of the Philippines by Ferdinand Marcos on 1972. When Southern Tagalog was divided into Calabarzon and Mimaropa, upon the issuance of &quot;Executive Order No. 103&quot; by then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo dated May 17, 2002, Romblon was made part of Mimaropa, officially Southwestern Tagalog Region.

==Geography==

Romblon is strategically situated at the center of the Philippine archipelago. Geographically part of the Visayas, it is composed of three major islands (Tablas, Sibuyan and Romblon) and 17 smaller islands. It is surrounded by deep waters, and is bounded by Masbate in the east, Mindoro in the west, Marinduque in the north and Panay in the south. It is approximately and south of Manila. The islands are dispersed and accessible only via sea transportation except for Tablas Island where a domestic airport is located in the municipality of Alcantara.

===Topography===
The province has a total land area of approximately representing about 5.3 percent of the total land area of Region IV-B Mimaropa. It is generally mountainous with about 40 percent of its land area having an inclination of more than 50 percent. Only four percent of the total area has an inclination of three to eight percent, while a sparse 10 percent has an inclination of three to zero percent. Narrow strips of coastal lowlands, low hills and plains typify the topography of some of the islands.

Romblon Island is hilly with a maximum elevation of about above sea level. Tablas Island shows varied relief characteristics. The western coastal areas are level to undulating while the eastern coastal areas are rough to rugged. The southern section covering Santa Fe and the mid-western portion may be described as having rolling to rough terrain. Extremely rugged areas can be found in the central section of the island. The highest elevation is almost above sea level. Sibuyan Island is a thickly forested mountain mass. The western portion of the island may be characterized as extensively rugged, having ascents of 60 percent or more while the eastern section is relatively undulating to rolling. The highest elevation, the peak of Mt. Guiting-Guiting, reaches about 2,058 meters (6,750 feet) above sea level.

The major areas that are highly productive and buildable are basically in Tablas and Sibuyan. These include Odiongan, San Andres, Looc and Santa Fe in Tablas Island. All three municipalities in Sibuyan Island, on the other hand, have substantial level to gently sloping lands. Overall, good developable lands represent about 13 percent of the province&#x27;s total area.

===Flora and fauna===
Romblon, particularly Sibuyan Island, is among the few places in the Philippines with a well-preserved natural environment. Uninterrupted rainforest covers 75 percent of the island. It is also home to the country&#x27;s cleanest inland body of water, the Cantigas River, as well as 34 waterfalls. Sibuyan is commonly known the country as the &quot;Galapagos of Asia&quot; because of its many endemic plant and animal species, some of which have just been discovered recently. Among these endemic species are nine mammals, seven lizards, two amphibians, three birds and 112 vascular plants, such as the &quot;Nepenthes argentii&quot;, &quot;Nepenthes sibuyanensis&quot;, &quot;Nepenthes armin&quot;, Sibuyan striped shrew rat, Sibuyan shrew, Philippine tube-nosed fruit bat, indigo-banded kingfisher, and the Romblon hawk-owl. In Tablas Island, at least two endemic bird species can be found: the Tablas drongo and Tablas fantail.

===Administrative divisions===
Romblon comprises 17 municipalities. Of these, nine are located in Tablas Island (San Agustin, Calatrava, San Andres, Odiongan, Ferrol, Santa Fe, Looc, Alcantara and Santa Maria), three in Sibuyan Island (Magdiwang, Cajidiocan and San Fernando) and five (Romblon, San Jose, Banton, Concepcion and Corcuera) are island municipalities.


===Climate===
Romblon falls under Type III of the Corona climatic classification system which was devised in 1920. It is characterized by no pronounced wet and dry seasons. Generally, the wet season is from June to November and sometimes extends up to December when the southwest monsoon is predominant. The dry season is from January to May but is sometimes interrupted by erratic rainfall. The annual mean temperature is , with February as the coldest month with temperatures dropping to , and May as the warmest month with temperatures reaching up to . &quot;Habagat&quot; monsoon winds pass through the province from June to October while northeasterly winds or &quot;Amihan&quot; blows through the islands from December to February.

==Demographics==
The population of Romblon in the 2020 census was 308,985 people, with a density of , ranking it fourth among the five provinces of Mimaropa in terms of population with 9.9 percent of the region&#x27;s population.

San Jose and Romblon are the two most-densely populated municipalities in the province at 490/km2 and 450/km2, respectively. Cajidiocan is the least densely populated municipality at 110/km2.

Males outnumber females in the province with a sex ratio of 102:100 according to the 2010 census. Of the province&#x27;s 283,482 household population, males accounted for 144,091 or 50.8 percent while females made up 139,391 or 49.2 percent. The voting-age population (18 years old and over) accounted for 56.6 percent of the household population of the province in 2010, up from 52.7 percent in 2000. There were more females (50.2 percent) than males (49.8 percent) among the voting age population.

===Language===


The languages of Romblon, as well as all languages native to the Philippines, belong to the Austronesian language family, the second largest language family in the world with 1,257 known languages, second only to the Niger–Congo family&#x27;s 1,538 languages. All of the languages of the Philippines, except Samalan, are classified as Philippine languages under the Western Malayo-Polynesian branch of Austronesian. The Philippine language group has three main branches: Northern, Southern and Central, the latter of which is composed of the Bisayan, Bikol and Tagalog languages.

Unlike other islands or provinces in the Philippines where all local languages are classifiable under the same subgroup of languages, each of the three languages of Romblon — Romblomanon, Onhan and Asi — actually belongs to a different subgroup of the Visayan language group. Romblomanon belongs to the Central Visayan subgroup, which spans from Waray-Waray in Samar and Leyte, through Masbatenyo and Sorsoganon, and as far west as Hiligaynon and Capiznon on Panay. It is spoken in Romblon and Sibuyan Islands, as well as in the municipality of San Agustin in Tablas Island.

Onhan, on the other hand, belongs to the Western Visayan subgroup, which includes Kinaray-a and Aklanon, as well as several minor languages spoken on Mindoro, Palawan, and some small islands in between. Its speakers are mainly from the southern portion of Tablas Island, in the municipalities of San Andres, Santa Maria, Alcantara, Ferrol, Looc, and Santa Fe, as well as in the municipality of San Jose in Carabao Island. Finally, Asi is not classified under any specific subgroup of Visayan, and instead makes up its own immediate branch of Visayan. David Paul Zorc, a linguist from the Australian National University whose expertise is on Philippine languages, notes that Asi speakers may have been the first Visayan speakers in the region. He also suggests that Asi may have a Cebuano substratum and that many of its words may have been influenced by the later influx of other languages such as Romblomanon. It is spoken in the island municipalities of Banton, Corcuera and Concepcion, as well as in Odiongan and Calatrava in Tablas. Hiligaynon is spoken in municipalities near Capiz and Aklan. As Romblon is part of Mimaropa which is also known as Southwestern Tagalog Region, provincial settlers speak Tagalog/Filipino as &quot;lingua franca&quot; between different Visayan languages.

===Religion===

The people of the province are predominantly Roman Catholic. In 2012, the UP School of Economics reported that 75 percent of households were Catholic (Roman Catholic and &quot;Iglesia Filipina Independiente&quot; combined), 9 percent were Muslim and 3-5 percent belonged to Iglesia ni Cristo. Another governmental source reported in 2011 that Mainline Protestants and Evangelicals then formed a significant minority of up to 8% of the population.

==Economy==
Romblon used to be one of the poorest provinces in the Philippines until 2015 when it recorded lower poverty incidence of 38.63 percent, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority. Poverty incidence in the province further declined to 28.28 percent in 2018. The provincial economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, tourism and mineral extraction which can be greatly affected by typhoons the frequently pass through the province yearly.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is the main industry in Romblon. Coconut is the most cultivated crop with a total planted area of . San Agustin has the most extensive area with coconut plants followed by Romblon and Cajidiocan. Rice is the next crop, cultivated particularly in Odiongan, Looc, Cajidiocan and Santa Fe. Other crops grown include root crops, vegetables and fruits. Odiongan, Banton and Magdiwang have the greatest areas planted with root crops and correspondingly, have the highest volume of production. Vegetable production is mostly for home consumption and grown in small scale.

Livestock development and poultry production is a viable small scale enterprise for farmers in the province. The provincial government maintains breeding facilities in strategic locations province-wide to encourage farmers to engage in livestock and poultry production to augment their income. Livestock and poultry management training and seminars is provided to interested clients.

Due to the geographical condition of the province, crops and livestock production is generally deficient as compared to the food requirements of Romblon population. To meet the rice requirements, Romblon relies on imports from the neighboring provinces while vegetables, poultry meat, vegetables and fruits are supplied mostly by Luzon.

===Marine resources===
Fishing industry is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides. The fishing grounds of Romblon are a migratory path of fish from Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait, Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass. The waters also abound with demersal fish due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.

Because the province has a great potential for aqua-marine development, the province implemented a coastal and resource management program. Each municipality established a fish sanctuary and passed laws on fishery. The use of air compressors in the municipal waters was regulated and banned altogether in some municipalities.

===Mineral resources===
Marble is the most significant mineral deposit of Romblon and is the most renowned product of the province. Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.

Marble quarrying and processing are major activities in Romblon. Among the most common marble products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, marble chips). Other mineral resources with considerable quantity include nickel ore and gold mostly to be found in Sibuyan Island. Gold panning and small-scale mining is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang.

==Tourism==


===Natural attractions===
Being an archipelago, Romblon has numerous beaches and dive sites. Among its best white sand beaches are Bonbon, Cobrador and Tiamban Beach in Romblon, Macat-ang, Tabunan and Tambak Beach in Banton, Lunas and Bignay Beach in San Jose, and Cresta del Gallo in San Fernando. The sea surrounding Cresta del Gallo is a famous diving site teeming with marine life. Romblon is also home to the Tablas Island Blue Hole, the only known blue hole in the Philippines, located in the town of San Agustin. The entrance to the blue hole is a wide volcanic chimney, which drops for before opening up into the massive chamber below with a total depth of .

Mount Guiting-Guiting in Sibuyan, the province&#x27;s tallest mountain, is considered one of the most difficult climbs in the Philippines, and is thus a major destination of local mountain climbers because of its steep and jagged summit. Another a suitable place for hiking and trekking is Mount Payaopao is Tablas. Meanwhile, Banton&#x27;s Guyangan Cave System, an Important Cultural Treasure, is where the Banton Cloth — the earliest known warp &quot;ikat&quot; textile in Southeast Asia — was found in 1936.

===Heritage sites===
Aside from the precolonial Guyangan Cave System in Banton, the province also has several heritage sites built during the Spanish colonial period. In Romblon town, the forts of San Andres and Santiago served as fortifications against Muslim pirates in the 17th century, while the St. Joseph Cathedral and Belfry houses a centuries-old image of the Santo Niño de Cebú or the Holy Child. Both heritage sites were declared National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum. The town also has colonial-era bridges that were declared Important Cultural Treasures. A similar fort in Banton, the centuries-old Fort San Jose and Banton Church, were built in the 1600s and was also used as defenses against Muslim pirates.

===Festivals===
Every second week of January, Romblon town celebrates the feast of the Santo Niño de Cebú, also known as the Biniray Festival. In that week, a fluvial parade featuring the image of the Santo Niño goes around Romblon Bay in order to bring good luck to the villages. A Mardi Gras is also held in the town with various street dancing, food, drinks and music. A similar Biniray Festival also occurs in Banton every 10 September in commemoration of the island&#x27;s patron, San Nicolas de Tolentino. Other festivals include the Saginyogan Festival in Alcantara, the Sanrokan Festival in Banton, and Looc&#x27;s Talabukon Festival, which honors the giant genie-like epic hero, Talabukon, who saved the people from pirates.

=== Scuba diving ===
In recent years Romblon Island has attracted more scuba divers. It has pristine and untouched reefs with almost undisturbed hard and soft corals around the islands of Romblon, Logbon, Alad and Cobrador. With multiple marine sanctuaries and private associations most of the marine life around Romblon is protected. In addition to the reefs, Romblon has been becoming famous for its rare and unique macro habitat, such as the &quot;Melibe colemani&quot;, the &quot;Cyerce nigra&quot; and the &quot;Cyerce bourbonica&quot;.

==Government==

===Executive===


Just like any other province in the Philippines, Romblon&#x27;s chief executive and head is the provincial governor. Elected to a term of three years and limited to three consecutive terms, he or she appoints the directors of each provincial department, which include the office of administration, engineering office, information office, legal office, and treasury office. As of 30 June 2019, the incumbent governor of Romblon is Jose &quot;Otik&quot; Riano, from the PDPLBN. He was elected in 2013 as vice-governor and reelected in 2016.

The provincial vice governor also convenes the Provincial Board or &quot;Sangguniang Panlalawigan&quot;, the provincial legislative body. The incumbent provincial vice governor of Romblon is Felix Ylagan from the LAKAS. He is a grandson of the late governor of the same province, Perpetuo Ylagan.

===Legislative===
The province, which is a lone congressional district, is represented in the Philippine House of Representatives by longtime Representative Eleandro Jesus &quot;Budoy&quot; Madrona from the Nacionalista Party. He first assumed office from 1992 to 2001, serving three terms. Following two terms wherein Perpetuo Ylagan and Eduardo Firmalo respectively represented the district in Congress, Madrona ran and won again in 2007. His third and last term will expire in 2016.

Within the province, the Provincial Board or &quot;Sangguniang Panlalawigan&quot; crafts all provincial ordinances, performs appropriation of provincial funds, issues franchises and permits, impose fees on provincial services, and exercise other duties and powers as stipulated by the Local Government Code of 1991.

===Provincial seal===

Romblon&#x27;s provincial seal is composed of two concentric circles: A smaller blue circle over a larger white circle. The white circle forms a band, with the words &quot;Lalawigan ng Romblon&quot; (Province of Romblon) on top and &quot;Pilipinas&quot; (Philippines) on the bottom each written in semi-circular fashion. The blue circle symbolizes Romblon&#x27;s geography as an archipelago surrounded by sea. On the middle of the blue circle is the province&#x27;s designated five-sided white shield. At the center of the shield are 17 green human figures that appear to be linking arms. These symbolize the 17 municipalities that make up the province. Its green color represents the island&#x27;s ecological and agricultural resources.

The human figures form a circle surrounding five figures: A marble craftsman and a marble &quot;almirez&quot; (mortar and pestle), representing the province&#x27;s marble industry. On its left side is the image of a fish, representing the province&#x27;s fishing industry, and on its right side is a coconut, representing the province&#x27;s copra industry. Behind the craftsman is a green outline of a mountain, representing Mount Guiting-Guiting National Park, a protected nature reserve where the province&#x27;s tallest mountain is located. Behind the mountain is a rising sun, similar to the sun found on the Philippine flag, representing the Divine Providence of abundant natural resources.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Romblon province is connected by a network of national and provincial roads. National roads form much of this network, with a total length of . Provincial roads, meanwhile, total in length.

<text>In marketing, a product is an object, or system, or service made available for consumer use as of the consumer demand; it is anything that can be offered to a domestic or an international market to satisfy the desire or need of a customer. In retailing, products are often referred to as merchandise, and in manufacturing, products are bought as raw materials and then sold as finished goods. A service is also regarded as a type of product.

In project management, products are the formal definition of the project deliverables that make up or contribute to delivering the objectives of the project.

A related concept is that of a sub-product, a secondary but useful result of a production process.

Dangerous products, particularly physical ones, that cause injuries to consumers or bystanders may be subject to product liability.

==Product classification==

A product can be classified as tangible or intangible. A tangible product is an actual physical object that can be perceived by touch such as a building, vehicle, gadget, or clothing. An intangible product is a product that can only be perceived indirectly such as an insurance policy. These services can be broadly classified under intangible products, which can be durable or nondurable.

===By use===
In its online product catalog, retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company divides its products into &quot;departments&quot;, then presents products to potential shoppers according to (1) function or (2) brand. Each product has a Sears item number and a manufacturer&#x27;s model number. Sears uses the departments and product groupings with the intention of helping customers browse products by function or brand within a traditional department-store structure.

===By association===
A product line is &quot;a group of products that are closely related, either because they function in a similar manner, are sold to the same customer groups, are marketed through the same types of outlets, or fall within given price ranges.&quot;
Many businesses offer a range of product lines which may be unique to a single organisation or may be common across the business&#x27;s industry. In 2002 the US Census compiled revenue figures for the finance and insurance industry by various product lines such as &quot;accident, health and medical insurance premiums&quot; and &quot;income from secured consumer loans&quot;. Within the insurance industry, product lines are indicated by the type of risk coverage, such as auto insurance, commercial insurance and life insurance.

===National and international product classifications===
Various classification systems for products have been developed for economic statistical purposes. The NAFTA signatories are working on a system that classifies products called NAPCS as a companion to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The European Union uses a &quot;Classification of Products by Activity&quot; among other product classifications. The United Nations also classifies products for international economic activity reporting.

The Aspinwall Classification System classifies and rates products based on five variables:
# Replacement rate (How frequently is the product repurchased?)
# Gross margin (How much profit is obtained from each product?)
# Buyer goal adjustment (How flexible are the buyers&#x27; purchasing habits with regard to this product?)
# Duration of product satisfaction (How long will the product produce benefits for the user?)
# Duration of buyer search behavior (How long will consumers shop for the product?)

The National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP) developed a commodity and services classification system for use by state and local governments, the NIGP Code. The NIGP Code is used by 33 states within the United States as well as thousands of cities, counties and political subdivisions. The NIGP Code is a hierarchical schema consisting of a 3 digit class, 5 digit class-item, 7 digit class-item-group, and an 11 digit class-item-group-detail. Applications of the NIGP Code include vendor registration, inventory item identification, contract item management, spend analysis, and strategic sourcing.

== Product model ==

A manufacturer usually provides an identifier for each particular design of product they make, known as a model, model variant, or model number (often abbreviated as MN, M/N or model no., and sometimes as M- or Mk). For example, Dyson Ltd, a manufacturer of appliances (mainly vacuum cleaners), requires customers to identify their model in the support section of the website. Brand and model can be used together to identify products in the market. The model number is not necessarily the same as the manufacturer part number (MPN).

Because of the huge amount of similar products in the automotive industry, there is a special kind of defining a car with options (marks, attributes) that represent the characteristics features of the vehicle. A model of a car is defined by some basic options like body, engine, gearbox, and axles. The variants of a model (often called the trim levels) are built by some additional options like color, seats, wheels, mirrors, other trims, entertainment and assistant systems, etc. Options, that exclude each other (pairwise) build an option family. That means that you can choose only one option for each family and you have to choose exactly one option.

In addition, a specific unit of a product is often (and in some contexts must be) identified by a serial number, which is necessary to distinguish products with the same product definition. In the case of automotive products, it is called the vehicle identification number (VIN), an internationally standardised format.

==Product information==

Product information, beyond currency price information, can include:

Many of these types of product information are regulated to some degree, such as to some degree prohibiting false or misleading product information or requiring sellers or manufacturers to specify various information such as ingredients of food-, pharmaceutical- and hygiene-products. There also is standardization. Marketing to entice the shopper is often prioritized over accurate, high-quality or extensive and relevant information.

Product information is often a key element in the buyer decision process. Relevant factors include trust in the accuracy of the information and social normative pressure. Easily accessible and up-to-date medicinal product information can contribute to the health literacy. Online shopping is usually more informationally rich than shopping at physical stores traveled to and usually has higher comparability and customizability.

Production information-related developments can be useful for enabling, facilitating, or shifting towards sustainable consumption and support more sustainable products. Environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely used for to assess environmental impacts across the life cycle of products. There are LCA datasets that assess all products in some supermarkets in a standardized way. Consumers may seek reliable information to evaluate relevant characteristics of products such as durability and reliability. Development of &#x27;transparency by design&#x27; scenarios have been suggested to &quot;complement the physical product with layers of digital information&quot;, improving transparency and traceability (T&amp;T). The app CodeCheck gives some smartphone users some capability to scan products for assessed ingredients. Many labels are considered to be flawed and few have the time to &quot;study the true environmental impact of every purchase&quot;. Full product transparency is a concept of making the full life-cycle impacts public. An important element that is required for various product information is supply chain transparency, which relates to human rights and supply chain sustainability.

===Produce traceability===
===Product passports===
In the EU, under the renewed Sustainable Product Policy Initiative, the inclusion of a Digital Product Passport has been proposed. A material passport is a document consisting of all the materials that are included in a product or construction. It consists of a set of data describing defined characteristics of materials in products, useful for recovery, recycling, re-use and various evaluations. They may contribute to a more circular economy.

<text>Arthur Hoffmann (19 June 1857 in St. Gallen – 23 July 1927 in St. Gallen) was a Swiss politician and member of the Swiss Federal Council (1911–1917).

Hoffmann was the son of Karl Hoffmann (1820–1895), who declined his election to the Swiss Federal Council in 1881.

Arthur Hoffmann was elected to the Federal Council on 4 April 1911 and resigned on 19 June 1917 as a result of the Grimm–Hoffmann Affair which seriously questioned Switzerland&#x27;s neutrality during World War I.

He was affiliated to the Free Democratic Party.

During Hoffmann&#x27;s office time he held the following departments:
* Department of Justice and Police (1911)
* Military Department (1912–1913)
* Political Department (1914–1917)
Hoffmann was President of the Confederation in 1914.

<text>Emil Johann Rudolf Frey (24 October 1838 – 24 December 1922) was a Swiss politician, Union Army soldier in the American Civil War and member of the Swiss Federal Council (1890–1897). He served as President of the Swiss Confederation in 1894.

==Early life==
Frey was born in Arlesheim, in the Canton of Basel-Landschaft, to Emil Remigius Frey and Emma Kloss. His father was a liberal separatist politician.

Frey&#x27;s family provided refuge for Friedrich Hecker when he fled the repression following the revolution in Germany in 1848. After attending &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Basel, Frey went to study in an agronomical institute in Jena. In 1860 he emigrated to the United States, arriving in Belleville, Illinois, an area with many Forty-Eighters, veterans of the 1848 revolutions in Europe. For a while he worked for Hecker, but they had a falling-out.

== Military career ==

=== American Civil War ===

Frey enlisted in the Union Army&#x27;s 24th Illinois Infantry Regiment as a private. He wrote in his essay &quot;My American Experiences&quot; that &quot;on 17th of June [1861] I enlisted in the 24th at Chicago. On that same day I was appointed by Colonel Hecker to be the colorbearer of the regiment, and in the evening we left Chicago for Alton, Ill.&quot; Hecker was his commander, and they became friends again, with Frey sharing a tent with Hecker&#x27;s son. Frey was later promoted to first lieutenant but resigned on 17 June 1862.

Frey raised the 82nd Illinois Infantry Regiment (known as &quot;Second Hecker Regiment&quot;) and was the regiment&#x27;s acting colonel at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. He was taken prisoner on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg, and following held in Libby Prison for eighteen months before being exchanged for Captain Gordon, a Confederate prisoner who had been sentenced to death. Frey held the rank of major at the end of the war . He rescinded his Swiss citizenship on 14 July 1864, and took on the American. 

=== Swiss Army ===
He didn&#x27;t count with the mandatory military service in Switzerland, but on his return from the United States, in view of his experience from the American civil war, he was made a major of the Swiss Army from the beginning. When he assumed as a Federal Councillor, he had the rank of a Colonel.

==Political career==
After the Civil War, Frey returned to Switzerland. From 1866 to 1872, he was a member of the cantonal government of Basel-Country. Not satisfied with the salary as politician he shortly was an editor for the journal Basler Nachrichten in 1872. The same year, Frey was elected to the Swiss National Council, council he presided in 1875/1876.

From 1882 to 1888, Frey was the first ambassador (&quot;Minister&quot;) of Switzerland to the United States in Washington. The US President Chester A. Arthur saw him as the representative for both states. During his tenure as ambassador, he always stayed the summers in Arlesheim, his hometown.

He was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 11 December 1890 and handed over office on 31 March 1897. He was affiliated to the Free Democratic Party. During his office time he held the Military Department. During his tenure he tried to introduce a military reform, but in a referendum the people voted against it. He was confirmed as a Federal Councillor in December 1896, but he resigned from office in 1897.

He was President of the Confederation in 1894.

==International Telegraph Union==

In 1897, following his retirement from his second period as a member of Switzerland’s National Council, Frey was nominated as Director of the ITU Bureau at the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference to replace Timotheus Rothen. He held the post for almost a quarter of a century and took part in the International Telegraph Conferences of 1903 in London and 1908 Lisbon. 

After leaving ITU in August 1921, Frey died, two months after his eighty-fifth birthday, on Christmas Eve 1922.

== Personal life ==
In 1870, he married Emma Kloss (born 1848) from Liestal, with whom he had five children: Hans (1871–1913), Emil (1872–1913), Carl (1873–1934), Anna (1874–1893) and Helene (1876–1944). In 1877 Emma died from pulmonary tuberculosis, aged just 28 years.

<text>Myllokunmingia is a genus of basal chordate from the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China 518 mya and is thought to be a vertebrate, although this is not conclusively proven. The type species M. fengjiaoa is 28 mm long and 6 mm high. It is among the oldest possible craniates, found in the lower Cambrian Chengjiang (). It appears to have a skull and skeletal structures made of cartilage. There is no sign of biomineralization of the skeletal elements. The holotype was found in the Yuanshan member of the Qiongzhusi Formation in the Eoredlichia Zone near Haikou at Ercaicun, Kunming City, Yunnan, China. Some researchers have considered the other primitive chordate &quot;Haikouichthys&quot; to be synonymous with this taxon, but subsequent studies led by the British paleontologist Simon Conway Morris identified both genera to be distinct, separate taxa on the basis of different gill arrangement, the absence of branchial rays in &quot;Myllokunmingia&quot; and the myomeres having a more acute shape in &quot;Haikouichthys&quot;.

The animal has a distinct head and trunk with a forward sail-like (1.5 mm) dorsal fin and a ventral finfold (probably paired) further back. The maximum height of &quot;M. fengjiaoa&quot; is at 6mm. The maximum height point is located around 11mm from the anterior. The head has five or six gill pouches with hemibranchs. In the trunk there are 25 segments (myomeres) with rearward-facing chevrons. There is a notochord, a pharynx and a digestive tract that may run all the way to the rear tip of the animal. The mouth cannot be clearly identified. There may be a pericardial cavity. There are no fin radials on M. fengjiaoa. There is only one specimen, which has the tip of the tail buried in sediment.

<doc id="240416" wikidata="Q370750" url="?curid=240416" title="Savannah River">
<text>The Savannah River is a major river in the Southeastern United States, forming most of the border between the states of Georgia and South Carolina. The river flows from the Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, for a total distance of about . The Savannah was formed by the confluence of the Tugaloo River and the Seneca River. Today this confluence is part of Lake Hartwell, a man-made reservoir constructed between 1955 and 1964.

Two tributaries of the Savannah, the Tugaloo River and the Chattooga River, form Georgia&#x27;s northernmost border with South Carolina. A tributary of the Tugaloo, the Tallulah River, forms the northwest branch of the Savannah and features the two-mile-long (3 km) and almost 1,000-foot-deep (300 m) Tallulah Gorge. The Savannah River&#x27;s drainage basin extends into the southeastern Appalachian Mountains and the state of North Carolina, and is bounded by the Eastern Continental Divide.

Two major cities in Georgia are located along the Savannah River: Savannah and Augusta. Founded in 1733 and 1736, respectively, they were nuclei of early English settlements during the colonial period of American history.

The Savannah River is tidal at the city of Savannah. Downstream from the city, the river broadens into an estuary before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. The area where the river&#x27;s estuary meets the ocean is known as Tybee Roads. The U.S. Intracoastal Waterway flows through a section of the Savannah River near the city proper.

==Name==
The name &quot;Savannah&quot; comes from a group of Shawnee who migrated to the Piedmont region in the 1680s. They destroyed the Westo and occupied established Westo lands at the Savannah River&#x27;s head of navigation on the Fall Line. Present-day Augusta developed near there. These Shawnee were called by several variant names, which all derive from their native name, &quot;Ša·wano·ki&quot; (literally, &quot;southerners&quot;). The local variants included Shawano, Savano, Savana, and Savannah.

Another theory is that the name was derived from the English term &quot;savanna&quot;, a kind of tropical grassland, which was borrowed by the English from Spanish &quot;sabana&quot; and used in the colonial southeast. The Spanish word was borrowed from the Taino word &quot;zabana&quot;. Other theories interpret the name Savannah to have come from Atlantic coastal tribes, who spoke Algonquian languages. These have similar terms meaning &quot;southerner&quot; or perhaps &quot;salt&quot;.

Historical and variant names of the Savannah River, as listed by the U.S. Geological Survey, include May River, Westobou River (for the Westo tribe), Kosalu River, Isundiga River, and Girande River, among others.
==History==
=== Early history ===
The Westo were thought to have migrated from the northeast, pushed out by the more powerful tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, who had acquired firearms through trade. This migration, beginning in the late 16th century, resulted in the Westo Indians reaching the present area of Augusta, Georgia, in the late 17th century.

The Westo used the river for fishing and water supplies, for transportation, and for trade. They were strong enough to hold off the Spanish colonists making incursions from Spanish Florida. The Carolina Colony needed the Westo alliance during its early years. When Carolinians desired to expand their trade to Charleston, they viewed the Westo tribe as an obstacle. In order to remove the tribe, they sent a group called the Goose Creek Men to arm the Savanna (also known as the Savannah) Indians, a Shawnee tribe, who defeated the Westo in 1680.

Following this, the English colonists renamed the river as the Savannah; it was integral to early development. They founded two major cities on the river during the colonial era: Savannah was established in 1733 as a seaport on the Atlantic Ocean, and Augusta is located where the river crosses the Fall Line of the Piedmont, at the headwaters of the navigable portion of the river downstream to the ocean. The two cities on the Savannah served as Georgia&#x27;s first two state capitals. In the 19th century, the sandy river channel changed frequently, causing numerous steamboat accidents.

During the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a blockade around the Confederate States of America, forcing merchantmen to use specific ports along the coast best suited for this purpose. The harbor at Savannah became one of the busiest ports for blockade runners bringing in supplies for the Confederacy until it was cut off by the reduction of Fort Pulaski and Union capture of Cockspur Island.

The South Carolina-Georgia border was originally defined in the Treaty of Beaufort in 1787, which, among other things, &quot;[reserved] all islands in [the river] to Georgia&quot;. Over time, new islands were created. Some, namely the Barnwell islands, are on the South Carolina side of the original line. In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the new islands on the South Carolina side of the border belong to South Carolina.

===20th century to present===
Between 1946 and 1985, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built three major dams on the Savannah for hydroelectricity, flood control, and navigation. The J. Strom Thurmond Dam (1954), the Hartwell Dam (1962), and the Richard B. Russell Dam (1985) and their reservoirs combine in order to form over of lakes. In December 1986, an oil spill caused by an oil tanker docked at the port of Savannah resulted in approximately of fuel oil leaking into the river.

During the 1950s, the Savannah River Plant was constructed across 310 square miles of land on the South Carolina bank of the river northeast of Augusta, Georgia, displacing the residents of several small towns near the Savannah River. The site produced plutonium, tritium, and heavy water for the United States Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s nuclear weapons program. The facility, now called the Savannah River Site and operated by the U.S. Department of Energy, still plays an important role in the economy of the Augusta metropolitan area. Three of the site&#x27;s five production reactors as well as its coal power plant discharged waste heat to the Savannah River via Pen Branch, Steel Creek, and Beaver Creek while two reactors discharged heat to the man made PAR Pond on Lower Three Runs Creek. The Savannah River Plant also produced the majority of the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s heavy water supply by processing water from the Savannah River via the Girdler sulfide process. Heavy water was used as the moderator for the site&#x27;s production reactors. In 1956 Clyde L. Cowan and Frederick Reines first detected neutrinos with an experiment carried out at the Savannah River Plant P-Reactor.

During their operating lifetimes, the Savannah River Plant&#x27;s reactors significantly elevated the temperatures of several Savannah River tributaries. Since these reactors predate nuclear power generation and were some of the earliest large reactors in the world, this offered unique opportunities for the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory to study the impact of large-scale thermal discharge and other effects of the site&#x27;s operation. Efforts to remediate the thermal discharge directly to the river, such as the construction of a lake to receive the discharge of L-Reactor and cooling tower to dissipate the discharge of K-Reactor had been recently implemented by the time the reactors were shut down at the end of the Cold War. The Savannah River Site now extracts tritium, but using targets irradiated at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Tennessee, so the heat discharge associated with tritium production is no longer in the Savannah River basin.

The Vogtle Electric Generating Plant was constructed across the river from the Savannah River Plant, with units 1 and 2 completed in mid 1980s and units 3 and 4 completed in the early 2020s. This plant also requires water from the river, but all four units use large natural draft cooling towers to avoid large scale withdrawals or discharge. The McIntosh Combined Cycle Power Plant and Jasper Generating Station are situated further down the Savannah River which provides feed water for the mechanical draft cooling towers for their combined cycle natural gas plants.

==Course==
The Savannah River flows through a variety of climates and ecosystems during its course. It is considered an alluvial river, draining a drainage basin and carrying large amounts of sediment to the ocean. At its headwaters in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the climate is quite temperate. The river&#x27;s tributaries receive a small amount of snow-melt runoff in the winter. The majority of the river&#x27;s flow through the Piedmont region is dominated by large reservoirs. Below the Fall Line, the river slows and is surrounded by large blackwater bald cypress swamps. Numerous oxbow lakes mark the locations of old river channels, which have shifted course because of earthquakes and silting.

Another prominent feature are the numerous large bluffs that line the river in some locations. Most notable of these is Yamacraw Bluff, the location selected to build the city of Savannah. The river becomes a large estuary at the coast, where fresh- and saltwater mix. River dredging operations to maintain the Port of Savannah have caused the estuary zone to move further upstream than its historical home. This is causing the rare freshwater marshland to be taken over by saltwater spartina marsh.

Tributaries include:

*Black Creek
*Brier Creek
*Broad River
*Chattooga River
*Ebenezer Creek
*Knoxboro Creek
*Little River
*Rocky River
*Seneca River
*Tugaloo River

==Ecology==
The Savannah River Basin in the Southeast region of the U.S. has been experiencing environmental change from anthropocentric activities. The Savannah River has the fourth-highest toxic discharge in the country, according to a 2009 report by Environment America. The conversion of the vegetation cover, including the urban growth, agriculture expansion, and deforestation and reforestation take place throughout the basin, especially near the lakes and tributary waters in the middle and lower Savannah Basin. The continuous change of land use such as the conversion of forest areas to other types of land cover and vice versa can significantly lead to increasing threats to the environmental systems of the region.

The river supports a large variety of native and introduced aquatic species:

*Upper section - yellow perch, brook trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, crappie, striped bass, hybrid striped bass, white bass, bluegill, North American river otter, American mink, North American beaver, catfish

The river is one of only four in the southeast with significant populations of &quot;Hymenocallis coronaria&quot;, the shoals spider-lily. It has three populations in the primary river basin and one each in the tributaries of Stevens Creek in South Carolina and the Broad River in Georgia.

==Navigation==
Through the building of several locks and dams in the first half of the 20th century (such as the New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam, completed in 1937 during the Great Depression), and upstream reservoirs like Lake Hartwell, the Savannah River was once navigable by freight barges between Augusta, Georgia (on the Fall Line) and the Atlantic Ocean. Maintenance of this channel for commercial shipping ended in 1979, and the one lock below Augusta has been deactivated.

When a large piece of equipment (a deaerator) needed to be delivered to the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant construction site in 2013, the barge travelled upstream from the Port of Savannah only to the Georgia Power&#x27;s Plant McIntosh site, near Rincon, Georgia; from there, the cargo was moved by a road transporter.

He was born in Neuchâtel to François-Victor and Louise Borel. He was educated at the humanistic high school in Neuchâtel and then studied the law in Munich and Heidelberg. After finishing his studies he worked as a lawyer in Neuchâtel. In 1861 he married Marie Gullaume.

Borel became an auditor and translator in the National Council of Switzerland in 1860. In 1870 he was elected inquisitor for western Switzerland by the federal court.

== Politics ==
In 1857 he was elected into the legislative branch (Generalrat) of the city of Neuchâtel for the radical party, which is now the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland. He was elected to the city council in 1864, to the Grand Council of the canton of Neuchâtel and in 1865 he became a member of the State Council (Staatsrat) where he headed the military department from 1865 to 1870 and the department of justice from 1870 to 1872.

In 1865 he was elected to the Swiss Council of States which he presided in 1869. He was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 7 December 1872 with 37 years. During his office time he held the Department of Posts and Telegraph. He was a key player in the founding of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) with the Treaty of Bern in 1874. Borel became the first directory of the UPU and therefore resigned from his job as a federal councillor and handed over office on 31 December 1875 to his successor.

In 1889 there was a big unrest in Ticino. Borel was sent there and, together with troops from Zürich, he managed to restore order.

Borel headed the UPU until his death in 1892.

&quot;Quai Eugène-Borel&quot; in Neuchâtel is named for him.

<text>Stefano Franscini (23 October 1796 – 19 July 1857) was a Swiss politician and statistician. He was one of the initial members of the Swiss Federal Council elected in 1848 and Switzerland&#x27;s first native Italian speaking federal councillor. Franscini was affiliated to the Liberal Radical Party of Switzerland. During his office tenure he held the Department of Home Affairs. Important elements of his political legacy include political reforms in the Ticino during the 1830s and 1840s, Switzerland&#x27;s first federal population census in 1850, and the creation of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 1854/1855.

==Early life and education (1796–1824)==
Franscini was born in the village of Bodio, to a farmer&#x27;s family with humble backgrounds. Until the age of eleven, he visited a winter school run by a priest in the neighbouring village Personico. From 1808 to 1814, he attended the priests&#x27; seminary in Pollegio, from where he was sent to continue his education and training at the archiepiscopal seminary for priests in Milan. In 1819, he abandoned his religious classes for the sake of studying history, law, political economics, and pedagogy, financing his studies by working as a teacher and author of textbooks. He became friends with Carlo Cattaneo, who was a member of the liberal Carboneria at the time, and who introduced Franscini to Milan&#x27;s liberal political circles as well as to the works of political economist Melchiorre Gioia, sparking Franscini&#x27;s lifelong interest in economical statistics. In 1823, he married Teresa Massari, with whom he had two children before she died in 1831.

==Political career (1824–1848)==
Franscini returned to Bodio in 1824, where he continued his work as a teacher and author, also writing articles on history, economics, and statistics for the &quot;Gazzetta Ticinese&quot;. He and his wife founded a girls&#x27; school in Lugano based on the popular but controversial Bell-Lancaster method of mutual instruction.
In 1827, Franscini published Switzerland&#x27;s first comparative statistical analysis ever in &quot;Statistica della Svizzera&quot; (&quot;Statistics of Switzerland&quot;). The explicitly liberal text and interpretation were also translated to German, and helped build Franscini&#x27;s reputation in the political scene. One year later, he wrote &quot;Della pubblica istruzione nel Cantone Ticino&quot; (&quot;On public education in the canton of Ticino&quot;), in which he strongly criticized the backwardness of the cantonal government&#x27;s education policy. Another political text of his was published in Zürich in 1829, this time anonymously: &quot;Della riforma della Costituzione ticinese&quot; (&quot;On the reform of the Ticino&#x27;s constitution&quot;), a call for reform, including an outline of how a liberal constitution should be drafted, and a strong criticism of the canton&#x27;s restorative and conservative institutions. Franscini continued to write for liberal journals such as &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore del Ceresio&quot; and &quot;Il Repubblicano della Svizzera italiana&quot; and between 1837 and 1840 published &quot;La Svizzera italiana&quot;, a reform program for the canton of Ticino, based on a comprehensive statistical analysis of its political and economic condition.

His writings were not well received by the authoritarian cantonal government under Landamano Giovanni Battista Quadri
, but his ideas were shared by a majority of the Ticino&#x27;s legislative body, and they helped effectuate a constitutional reform and change of government. In the following years of reform, Franscini held several cantonal political offices: As a state secretary, from 1830 to 1837 and from 1845 to 1847, he prepared resolutions and laws for the cantonal government. He himself was an elected member of this government between 1837 and 1845, and again between 1847 and 1848. Franscini also represented the canton of Ticino at the Tagsatzung in 1841, 1843, 1845, and 1846. During his various tenures of office, Franscini was frequently sent on extraordinary missions, such as relief and calming missions in the Mendrisiotto during a cholera epidemic in 1836, and again during the famine of 1847. That same year he helped establish the armed defense in the Ticino to meet an unruly retreat of the Sonderbund&#x27;s troops who were losing the War of the Sonderbund. On a national level, he attended intercantonal conferences on trade, customs, and postal services, and, in 1847, received a mandate to mitigate a peaceful change to liberal order in the Valais after its defeat in the War of the Sonderbund. The &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; also sent him on a fact-finding mission to Naples, where Swiss mercenaries had been accused of atrocious behavior while suppressing uprisings preceding the revolutions of 1848.

==Federal council and death (1848–1857)==
Franscini was the fifth candidate proposed during the Swiss Federal Council&#x27;s first election which was held by the newborn Federal Assembly on 16 November 1848. He was elected in the third round, receiving 68 out of 135 valid votes – only one vote above the required absolute majority and the weakest result among the first seven members of the Federal Council.
For his entire tenure of eight years, Franscini supervised the Federal Department of Home Affairs. The constitution of 1848 granted the cantons far more autonomy than later revisions after 1874 would ever allow again, and the department&#x27;s defined scope of responsibility was very small in comparison to what it would become later. Its primary focus was to organize the federal chancellory and federal archive. Other official duties included the collection of statistical data, supervision of religious rights and peace between confessions, sanitary measures in case of epidemic disease, and the standardization of weights and measurement.

One of the department&#x27;s most important accomplishments under Franscini&#x27;s supervision was the realization of a federal polytechnical institute. Franscini originally wished to create a national university, built on ideals of patriotic identity, but rivalries among cantons forced him to abandon this plan for the sake of a school of technology. The Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule in Zürich held its first lectures in the autumn of 1855.

Franscini&#x27;s was able to apply his interest in statistics to his work in 1850, when the distribution of seats in the National Council by canton needed to be calculated, and he was commissioned to organize Switzerland&#x27;s first federal population census. Despite his strong belief in the value of collecting and evaluating statistical data – he saw it as one of a &quot;socially progressive nation&quot;&#x27;s duties – he wasn&#x27;t able to convince federal or cantonal politicians of its importance. With the aid of a private secretary, he was forced to evaluate the data of the census all by himself after Parliament failed to provide the necessary funds. His evaluations were published in a series of five volumes between 1851 and 1858, titled &quot;Beiträge zur Statistik der schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft&quot; (&quot;Contributions to the Statistics of the Swiss Confederation&quot;). The Federal Statistical Office was not introduced until 1860, after Franscini&#x27;s death, along with a law on federal population censuses, which were to be held every ten years henceforth.

Though the federal council was always only elected by the Federal Assembly, there was an unwritten rule at the time, relinquished since the 1870s, that federal councillors should be confirmed in their home canton&#x27;s election for the National Council as well. Franscini passed the test in 1851, but failed three years later, during the national elections of 1854, due to rivalries between the fractions of the Ticino&#x27;s liberals. He was obliged to run in delayed elections held in the canton of Schaffhausen where he finally managed to obtain the desired percentage of votes. The official election for Federal Council held by the Federal Assembly in 1854 proved to be a struggle as well; Franscini did not receive the absolute majority of votes until the third round, and many members of the assembly had given their vote to his Ticinese friend Giovanni Battista Pioda.

Fatigued by the lack of appreciation for his hard work, and apprehensive of another political embarrassment during the upcoming national elections, Franscini decided to resign from office in 1857. He planned on working in the Ticino&#x27;s cantonal archive, but died unexpectedly in Bern, while still in office, on 19 July 1857 aged 60. Eleven days later, Pioda was elected as his successor.

<text>Percival Noel James Patterson, (born 10 April 1935), popularly known as P.J. Patterson, is a Jamaican former politician who served as the sixth Prime Minister of Jamaica from 1992 to 2006. He served in office for 14 years, making him the longest-serving prime minister in Jamaica&#x27;s history. He was the leader of the People&#x27;s National Party from 1992 to 2006.

Patterson served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Westmoreland South Eastern from 1970 to 1980 (when he lost to Euphemia Williams of the Jamaica Labour Party) and again from 1989 to 1993. Following a constituency reorganization, he served as the MP for Westmoreland Eastern from 1993 to 2006. He retired from all of these positions in January 2006.

Cabinet positions he held during his political career include Minister of Industry and Tourism; Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade; Minister of Development, Planning and Production; Minister of Finance and Planning.

==Early life and education==

Patterson&#x27;s parents were Henry Patterson, a farmer, and Ina James, a primary school teacher, who both hailed from the Hanover Parish in western Jamaica. He received his secondary education at Kingston&#x27;s Calabar High School, and pursued higher studies at the University College of West Indies and later the London School of Economics.

As an undergraduate at the University of the West Indies (UWI), he served as Chairman of UWI&#x27;S External Affairs Commission, where he gained exposure to world leaders and international political thought through attendance at a number of international student fora. It was also at UWI that he became committed to Caribbean regionalism and to the causes of countries of the developing world. In 1958, he graduated with a B.A. (Honours) in English.

His time as a Law student of the London School of Economics consolidated his foundation in international politics and was awarded the Leverhume Scholarship, and the Sir Hughes Parry prize for Excellence in the Law of Contracts. While enrolled at the Inns of Court (Middle Temple), he and several of his fellow students were to become future leaders of the countries of the developing world.

==Early political life==

Patterson joined the organising staff of the People&#x27;s National Party (PNP) in 1958, and he became a member of the party&#x27;s National and Executive Councils in 1964. Patterson entered the Parliament of Jamaica as an Opposition Senator in 1969, appointed by Opposition Leader Norman Manley. He was elected the youngest ever Vice President of the PNP later that year at age 33.

When in 1969 his predecessor as Prime Minister of Jamaica, Michael Manley, launched his campaign for the Presidency of the PNP, he turned to P. J. Patterson, youngest of the highest-ranking segment of the party executive, to lead his campaign. This was the beginning of a partnership which endured over the next 23 years, and allowed for an exchange of political ideas and perspectives that proved beneficial to both.

Patterson was elected the Member of Parliament for Westmoreland South Eastern in the constituency&#x27;s by-election of 1970. The constituency borders were reorganized prior to the general election of 1993 and he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Westmoreland Eastern in that election, a seat he held until his retirement in 2006.

He was a campaign manager for the PNP&#x27;s bid for power in the General Elections of 1972, demonstrating skill as a political organizer that played a significant role in the party&#x27;s victory at the polls that year. This led to his first appointment to the Jamaican Cabinet as Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism. From 1978 to 1980, Patterson served as deputy prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade.

The PNP were voted out of power in 1980, and Patterson lost his seat to Euphemia Williams. However, in 1983, he was elected party chairman, and the PNP won by a landslide in 1989, and Patterson was back as deputy prime minister. From 1989 to 1990, Patterson was also Minister of Development, Planning and Production, and from 1990 to 1991, he was Minister of Finance and Planning.

==Premiership==

He assumed office as Prime Minister after Michael Manley retired in 1992, at a time when the Caribbean island nation was facing the formidable challenge of securing a place in a new global order of economic liberalization and deregulation. In the 1993 Jamaican general election, held on March 30, Patterson led the PNP to a second consecutive victory in the polls, winning 52 of the 60 seats up for grabs, defeating former prime minister Edward Seaga of the Jamaica Labour Party.

Patterson led efforts to strengthen the country&#x27;s social protection and security systems—a critical element of his economic and social policy agenda to mitigate, reduce poverty and social deprivation.

In the 1997 Jamaican general election, Patterson led the PNP to a third consecutive victory, breaking the &quot;third-term barrier&quot;. The PNP won 50 of the 60 seats available.

His massive investments in modernization of Jamaica&#x27;s infrastructure and restructuring of the country&#x27;s financial sector are widely credited with having led to Jamaica&#x27;s greatest period of investment in tourism, mining, ICT and energy since the 1960s. He also ended Jamaica&#x27;s 18-year borrowing relationship with the International Monetary Fund, allowing the country greater latitude in pursuit of its economic policies. In 2002, when Patterson led the PNP to another general election victory, but with a much-reduced majority of 34 out of 60 seats. He became the first Jamaican prime minister to be sworn in for a fourth consecutive term.

In September 2003, Patterson told a party conference that he wanted Jamaica to be a republic by the time he left office in 2007, saying &quot;The majority of people in Jamaica are ready to consign to history the last vestiges of colonialism&quot;. Patterson had long supported moves to make Jamaica a republic, but he was unsuccessful in this aim, as Jamaica is still a monarchy. In 2012, he expressed his frustration that a republic had still not come into being

He made international headlines in 2004 when, as Chairman of CARICOM, he led the regional organization in the decision to refuse recognition of the Gérard Latortue government in Haiti following the removal of the democratically elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide from office. Patterson arranged for Aristide to take up temporary residence in Jamaica during Aristide&#x27;s lawsuit against the United States and France accusing the countries of kidnapping him.

In one of his final initiatives as Prime Minister, he launched a program of radical transformation of the island&#x27;s education system aimed at development of quality human capital equipped to succeed in the competitive global economy. In addition, Patterson presided over a significant decline in poverty during his time in office.

Patterson retired as prime minister on 30 January 2006, and he was succeeded as PM by Portia Simpson-Miller. He was succeeded as MP by Luther Buchanan.

==Post-premiership==

Following his premiership, from 2006 to 2007, he chaired the Committee on Commonwealth Membership, which presented its report on potential changes in membership criteria for the Commonwealth of Nations at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2007 in Kampala, Uganda.

==International service==

Patterson is a member of the Club of Madrid, a group that consists of more than 100 former presidents and prime ministers of democratic countries, which works to strengthen democracy and democratic leadership worldwide.

Patterson has contributed to numerous Conventions and Statements in the international arena including the Valletta Statement on Multilateral Trade and the Gozo Statement on Vulnerable Small States. These have helped to shape north–south relationship and influence the negotiating position of developing countries.

He is a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an NGO composed of a number of former statesmen, ex-presidents and prime ministers founded in 2004 by former State President of South Africa and Nobel Prize laureate, the late F. W. de Klerk. The Global Leadership Foundation is an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

He played a seminal role in the process that marked the transition from the first steps in integration of the Caribbean region to the founding of CARIFTA and its evolution into CARICOM. He drew upon his expertise in law and trade, to steer the regional body toward the development of a Caribbean jurisprudence through the Caribbean Court of Justice, and a borderless regional economy through the CARICOM Single Market, which came to fruition in 2005 and 2006 respectively.

During his tenure as Jamaica&#x27;s foreign minister he served as president of the ACP/EU Ministerial Council and led negotiations for the ACP group of countries with the European Community. As chairman of the ACP/EEC Ministerial Conference, he played a pivotal role in forging an agreement on the basic framework for the original Lomé Convention, which influenced the outcome of subsequent negotiations that led to the Convention signed in 1975. He has served as president and spokesman of the ACP Ministerial Council on a number of occasions.

A passionate opponent of apartheid, he was an ardent proponent of South Africa&#x27;s liberation movement.

==Memberships and awards==

Upon becoming the prime minister of Jamaica in 1992, Patterson was invested with the Order of the Nation, allowing him to be known as &quot;The Most Honourable&quot; and to use the post-nominal letters &quot;ON&quot;.

In 2006, he was invested with the Order of Excellence of Guyana, allowing him to use the post-nominal letters &quot;OE&quot;. On 2 July 2009 he invested with the Order of the Caribbean Community allowing him to use the post-nominal letters &quot;OCC&quot;.

On 13 April 2022, Patterson resigned as a Privy Council member.

<doc id="240428" wikidata="Q5919478" url="?curid=240428" title="Invasion of the Waikato">
<text>The invasion of the Waikato became the largest and most important campaign of the 19th-century New Zealand Wars. Hostilities took place in the North Island of New Zealand between the military forces of the colonial government and a federation of Māori tribes known as the Kingitanga Movement. The Waikato is a territorial region with a northern boundary somewhat south of the present-day city of Auckland. The campaign lasted for nine months, from July 1863 to April 1864. The invasion was aimed at crushing Kingite power (which European settlers saw as a threat to colonial authority) and also at driving Waikato Māori from their territory in readiness for occupation and settlement by European colonists.
The campaign was fought by a peak of about 14,000 Imperial and colonial troops and about 4,000 Māori warriors drawn from more than half the major North Island tribal groups.

Plans for the invasion were drawn up at the close of the First Taranaki War in 1861 but the Colonial Office and New Zealand General Assembly opposed action, and the incoming Governor Sir George Grey (second term 1861–1868) suspended execution in December of that year. Grey reactivated the invasion plans in June 1863 amid mounting tension between Kingites and the colonial government and fears of a violent raid on Auckland by Kingite Māori. Grey used, as the trigger for the invasion, the Kingite rejection of his ultimatum on 9 July 1863 that all Māori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the Waikato River. Government troops crossed into Waikato territory three days later and launched their first attack on 17 July at Koheroa, but were unable to advance for another 14 weeks.

The subsequent war included the Battle of Rangiriri (November 1863)—which cost both sides more men than any other engagement of the New Zealand Wars—and the three-day-long Battle of Ōrākau (March–April 1864), which became arguably the best-known engagement of the New Zealand Wars and which inspired two films called &quot;Rewi&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;. The campaign ended with the retreat of the Kingitanga Māori into the rugged interior of the North Island and the colonial government confiscating about 12,000 km2 of Māori land.

The defeat and confiscations left the King Movement tribes with a legacy of poverty and bitterness that was partly assuaged in 1995 when the government conceded that the 1863 invasion and confiscation was wrongful and apologised for its actions. The Waikato–Tainui tribe accepted compensation in the form of cash and some government-controlled lands totalling about $171 million and later that year Queen Elizabeth II personally signed the Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995.
(The Governor-General normally gives Royal Assent to legislation by signing on the monarch&#x27;s behalf.)

==Background and origins of the invasion==
The First Taranaki War had ended in March 1861 as an uneasy truce between the government and Māori forces, with both sides recognising they had reached a stalemate. The lack of a clear victory by imperial forces led Governor Thomas Gore Browne to turn his attention to the Waikato, the centre of the Kīngitanga movement, where king Tāwhiao was attracting the allegiance of increasing numbers of Māori across the North Island. Browne concluded that members of the Kīngitanga movement would have to be compelled to submit to British rule. After attempting to achieve a peace settlement through &quot;kingmaker&quot; Wiremu Tamihana, in mid-1861 he sent an ultimatum to the movement&#x27;s leaders, demanding submission to Queen Victoria and the return of plunder taken from Taranaki; when it was rejected he began drawing up plans to invade the Waikato and depose the king—a plan opposed by both the Colonial Office and the New Zealand General Assembly. According to Browne, in response to his belligerence, Kingite leaders formed plans to launch a raid on Auckland on 1 September and burn the town and slaughter most of its residents. This has since been dismissed by such historians as James Belich as being fear-mongering from Browne in order to try and gain military support.

Browne&#x27;s invasion plan was suspended when he was replaced by Sir George Grey in September that year, and the Kingites in turn abandoned their plan for their uprising. Grey instead instituted a peace policy that included a system of Māori local administration in which they could participate, hoping it would encourage Māori to abandon the Kingite movement and &quot;reduce the number of our enemies&quot;. At the same time, however, Grey began planning for war, using troops from the newly formed Commissariat Transport Corps to start construction work on a road from Drury that would run about 18 km south through forest to the Kingite border at the Mangatāwhiri Stream—a tributary of the Waikato River—near Pokeno. The so-called Great South Road would provide quick access to troops in the event of an invasion. Using what historian James Belich describes as a campaign of misinformation, Grey retained the Taranaki army and began appealing to the colonial office for more troops to avert &quot;some great disaster&quot;, claiming tensions remained high, with a high likelihood of Māori aggression. In November 1862 he ordered a gunboat steamer from Sydney and purchased another in Lyttelton to supplement the supply system. By early 1863 the imperial government had provided Grey with 3000 men for the expected war.

Events in early 1863 brought tensions to a head. In March Kingites obstructed the construction of a police station at Te Kohekohe, near Meremere. Rewi Maniapoto, accompanied by Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke, led 80 armed Ngāti Maniapoto warriors in a raid on the 80 hectare property at Te Awamutu occupied by magistrate and Commissioner John Gorst to seize the printing press on which he published a newspaper and take it to Kihikihi. The raiders sent a message to Gorst—who was absent at the time—to quit the property or risk death; Grey recalled Gorst to Auckland soon after. On 4 April Grey arranged for a 300-strong Imperial force to evict Māori from the contested Tataramaika block in Taranaki and reoccupy it. Māori viewed the reoccupation as an act of war and on 4 May a party of about 40 Ngati Ruanui warriors carried out a revenge attack, ambushing a small military party on a coastal road at nearby Ōakura, killing all but one of the 10 soldiers. The ambush, ordered by Rewi, may have been planned as an assassination attempt on Grey, who regularly rode the track between New Plymouth and the Tataraimaka military post.

Imperial troops were moved back to Taranaki as hostilities resumed and on 4 June the new British commander, Lieutenant-General Duncan Cameron, led 870 troops to attack a party of about 50 Māori on the Tataraimaka block, killing 24. Concerned by the renewed aggression, some Kingites began resurrecting their plan to raid Auckland and its frontier settlements. The colonial ministry remained unconvinced Auckland or Wellington were in any danger and had refused to call out the Auckland militia following the Ōakura ambush, and missionaries and even Gorst dismissed the likelihood of an attack. But in correspondence to London Grey cited that incident as further proof of the imminent danger to New Zealand settlers.
On 9 July 1863 Grey issued a new ultimatum, ordering that all Māori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the river. As many young men retreated into the bush with their weapons, officials began seizing others—including the ill and aged—who declined to swear the oath, imprisoning them without charge. Two days later Grey issued a proclamation directed to the &quot;Chiefs of Waikato&quot;, which read:

Within a day—before the proclamation had even reached the Waikato—Grey ordered the invasion of the Kingite territory, claiming he was making a punitive expedition against Rewi over the Ōakura ambush and a pre-emptive strike to thwart a &quot;determined and bloodthirsty&quot; plot to attack Auckland. Though Grey claimed it was a defensive action, historian B. J. Dalton claimed his reports to London had been &quot;a deliberate and transparent falsehood&quot; and that the invasion was an act of &quot;calculated aggression&quot;. On 12 July Duncan Cameron and the first echelon of the invading army crossed the Mangatāwhiri Stream.

==First engagements==
Cameron, a Crimean War veteran who had replaced Major-General Thomas Pratt as commander-in-chief of the British troops, began the invasion with fewer than 4000 effective troops in Auckland at his disposal. But the continuous arrival of regiments from overseas rapidly swelled the force. (Total troop numbers reached 10,000 in January 1864 before peaking at about 14,000 in March 1864—9000 imperial troops, more than 4000 colonial and a few hundred &quot;kūpapa&quot;, or pro-British Māori.)

Cameron&#x27;s initial invasion force set up camp on the site of an old &quot;pā&quot; on a hill above the stream. Reinforcements continued to arrive and within days he had 500 troops. On the morning of 17 July Cameron led 553 men on a raid on a new and unfinished entrenchment at Koheroa, near Mercer. Cameron ran ahead of his force after they took early fire from Māori outposts and the Māori fighters fled. According to Belich, the Māori force numbered between 100 and 150 and about 15 were killed, some of them by bayonet. Among the dead were their leader Te Huirama, a relative of King Tāwhiao. British casualties totalled one dead and 12 wounded. But the same day a Māori war party ambushed a convoy of six carts and its 50-man escort well behind British lines, at Martin&#x27;s Farm near Ramarama on the Great South Road. A third of the British force were cut down—five soldiers killed and 11 wounded—while Māori losses were limited to two. The attack prompted the establishment of five new redoubts on the route, taking 510 of Cameron&#x27;s men.

The bush raid was the beginning of a new Māori strategy that would drain Cameron&#x27;s resources and halt his advance for another 14 weeks. On 22 July a group of about 40 Māori fatally shot a settler cutting timber at Pukekiwiriki near Papakura and were pursued into the forest by the Auckland militia. Seven Māori were killed. When two more settlers were killed at isolated farms near Drury on 24 July, the government formed a special corps of bush fighters named the &quot;Forest Rangers&quot;, who began a series of bush reconnaissance missions and pursuits of armed Māori bands. Cameron wrote: &quot;The bush is now so infested with these natives that I have been obliged to establish strong posts along our line of communication, which absorbs so large a portion of the force that until I receive reinforcements it is impossible for me to advance further up the Waikato.&quot;

By the end of August Cameron&#x27;s forces had grown to 6000 effectives. He had the armoured 40-ton paddle-steamer &quot;Avon&quot;—20m long, drawing one metre of water and armed with a 12-pounder Armstrong in the bows—as well as boats, barges and canoes. But Māori defences had also grown: the so-called Meremere Line—a 22 km-long line of fortifications that spread from Pukekawa to Meremere and Paparata—had been built, commanding about 2000 square kilometres of bush and manned by a force of up to 1500. The Meremere Line allowed bands of between 20 and 200 Māori warriors to freely cross the Waikato River and harass troops and kill settlers towards Auckland. On 25 August a party of Māori snatched up the rifles and ammunition from a group of 25 soldiers who were timber-felling beside the Great South Road—part of an effort to destroy cover for Māori raiders intent on mounting further ambushes—and killed two soldiers. On 2 September a British party of 62 men was fired on from the rear during a march on the village of Pokeno, but managed to pursue their attackers and inflict some casualties.

In mid-August the British established an alternative supply line to the Great South Road, using a combination of steamers from Onehunga to the Waikato Heads and canoes paddled up the Waikato by friendly Māori to Queen&#x27;s Redoubt at Pokeno. But on 7 September a Ngāti Maniapoto war party launched an attack on that supply line, killing resident magistrate James Armitage—who was supervising a shipment of stores—and burning a stores depot with 40 tons of supplies at Camerontown on the north bank of the Waikato River near Tuakau. The Ngāti Maniapoto then attacked a British redoubt overlooking Pokeno, from which they were driven off. The attack on the supply line, said Belich, &quot;was easily the most important single action of the first phase of the war&quot;.

Cameron responded by creating a series of about 20 stockades and redoubts all over the district, designed to protect the supply line and impede the ability of Māori to attack further north. Each stockade needed its own garrison—from 25 to 55 men—and supply line, eventually accounting for almost 6000 of his men, further draining him of frontline manpower. But Māori raids continued: almost 200 Ngāti Maniapoto surrounded a militia stockade at a Pukekohe East church on 14 September, losing about 40 men, and the same day a 20-man Ngāti Pou force attacked a homestead at Paerata, midway between Pukekohe and Drury, but were driven off by neighbours. The turning point for Cameron came in late October when hundreds of Waikato militia replaced regulars at the outposts, another 500 imperial troops arrived from Australia—now giving him a striking force of almost 2000 and a total of 8000 effectives—and a second river steamer, HMS &quot;Curacoa&quot;, was brought to the front. On 31 October a river flotilla including &quot;Avon&quot;, the gunboats &quot;Curacoa&quot; and &quot;Pioneer&quot; and armoured barges steamed past Meremere—drawing fire from rifle pits and batteries of ships guns, some of them firing pieces of iron chain and pound weights—and landed 600 men at Takapau, 15 km upriver, ready to attack the heart of the defensive line from the rear. The flotilla returned downstream, intending to bring up another 600 men the next day for the attack, but the plan was dropped when the Māori force evacuated the Meremere fortifications the following day and escaped eastwards across flooded lagoons by canoe, falling back to their next defensive system at Rangiriri.

==Rangiriri==

Three weeks later, on 20 November, Cameron, commanding a battle force of more than 1400 men, launched an attack on Rangiriri, further up the Waikato River. The battle cost both sides more than any other engagement of the land wars and also resulted in the capture of 180 Māori combatants, which impacted on their subsequent ability to oppose the far bigger British force.

The Rangiriri line, engineered by Te Wharepu, a leading Waikato chief, was a one kilometre-long system of deep trenches and high parapets that ran between the Waikato River and Lake Waikare. The front line ran east–west, while another line of defences ran south from the main line, facing the river. In the centre of the main line lay a small but well-protected north-facing redoubt with several lines of concealed rifle pits at its southern side. The defences consisted solely of earthworks, with no palisading; a redoubt midway along the main line, had a low profile and was deceptively strong.

Cameron arrived at Rangiriri with about 850 men, chiefly of the 65th, 14th and 12th regiments, to make the frontal assault. A second division of 320 men of the 40th Regiment under Lieut-Colonel Arthur Leslie with additional naval backup, were transported by barge further south with the aim of gaining possession of a ridge 500 metres behind the main entrenchment and cutting off any escape. The assault force, armed with three Armstrong guns, revolvers, Enfield rifles with fixed bayonets and hand grenades, faced a Māori force of about 500 men, mostly armed with double-barreled shotguns and muskets.

About 3pm Cameron launched a two-hour bombardment from artillery and gunboats. Without waiting for Leslie&#x27;s division, which was delayed by adverse conditions on the river, he began his frontal attack, storming the Māori positions across a 600m gap under heavy fire and immediately suffering casualties. Members of the 12th and 14th regiments who tried to climb the earthworks near the centre of the line with the aid of ladders were shot down and within a short time 40 of the British were dead or wounded. Members of the 65th Regiment, however, were more successful in reaching the trenches at the river side of the fortification, bridging them with planks and penetrating the Māori line. They killed about 30 Māori, with the surviving defenders fleeing south or towards the main redoubt. But when Cameron ordered an attack on the redoubt from the river side, his men began to come under heavy fire. Cameron ordered two more unsuccessful assaults on the central redoubt, which lifted British casualties to about 110.

As night fell, the British, dispirited by the scale of losses, slept on the wet ground, ready to renew the combat in the morning. But about 5am the Rangiriri garrison—still with arms and ammunition and with an escape route open to the east—raised a white flag, expecting to talk terms with Cameron. British soldiers advanced on the redoubt and entered, shook hands with their combatants, then surprised the Māori by demanding they surrender all their arms and taking them prisoner.

Belich wrote: &quot;The capture of Rangiriri was not the result of assault or encirclement, but of the British misuse of a flag of truce. The Māoris might conceivably have eventually decided to surrender unconditionally anyway, but they might also have repelled further assaults and escaped across the lake.&quot; He said they might have also been gaining time waiting for reinforcements who were almost on the scene. About 35 of the Māori force were killed, along with six women and children. Probably an equal number of injured were evacuated by canoe across Lake Waikare. With the capture of more than 180 warriors, the battle became the most costly Māori defeat in the Waikato wars. The 183 prisoners were held without trial on an old coal hulk in Waitematā Harbour before being moved to Kawau Island, north of Auckland, but in September 1864 they escaped and eventually made their way back to the Waikato.

Cameron attracted both praise for his &quot;skilful measures&quot; in the capture of Rangiriri and severe criticism over the high number of British losses. Yet the battle had highlighted the rapidly growing disparity between British and Māori forces and the inability of Waikato Māori to maintain their manpower continuously. Several Waikato chiefs including Te Wharepu expressed a willingness to negotiate and on 8 December the Kingite capital at Ngāruawāhia was abandoned and then taken by Cameron&#x27;s troops. But Māori were still opposed to the British demands of submitting to the Queen and surrendering all arms and lands and began building further defences south of Ngāruawāhia.

==Pāterangi and Rangiaowhia==

Construction of a new and even more formidable defence line began 25 km south of Ngāruawāhia, soon after the fall of Rangiriri. The line included fortifications at Pikopiko and Rangiatea and was centred on Paterangi, its largest &quot;pā&quot;, and was designed to block the main approaches to the agriculturally rich Rangiaowhia district, east of Te Awamutu, a major economic base, trading with Auckland, San Francisco and Melbourne, and a supply centre of the Kingite tribes. By the end of January 1864 the line had become the largest system of Māori fortifications of the land wars, consisting of at least four large &quot;pā&quot; spaced about 8 km apart, each of which included complex sets of entrenchments and parapets. The defence system, which included two cannons, was manned by a force of between 1200 and 2000 men from a dozen major Waikato &quot;iwi&quot;.

Two weeks after capturing Ngāruawāhia, Cameron&#x27;s 3000-strong striking force, protected by another 4000 men, began slowly and cautiously advancing south. In late January Cameron moved his army headquarters to Te Rore, about 5 km from Paterangi, with an advance camp for 600 men positioned just 1.2 km from the &quot;pā&quot;, from where they judged the defences were &quot;immensely strong&quot;. Cameron, whose men continued to be targeted daily by sniper fire and attacks on short reconnaissance missions, decided that rather than a frontal attack, the more prudent approach would be to outflank the Paterangi line. He gained the help of two Māori guides, Himi Manuao (James Edwards) and John Gage, who had previously lived in the area, who revealed a route that bypassed it to the west and south to reach Te Awamutu. A new supply line was established from Auckland, using boats to Raglan and packhorses across the ranges to meet steamers on the Waipā River. But a further advance into the heart of Kingitanga territory was delayed when the &quot;Avon&quot;—one of the most important components of the transport and supply system—accidentally sank in the Waipa on 8 February.

A significant engagement took place on 11 February when an assault party from Paterangi ambushed a group of soldiers bathing in a loop of the Mangapiki Stream at Waiari, near the British forward position. Two hundred of Cameron&#x27;s troops, with the Forest Rangers, became involved in a running battle with the attackers and killed an estimated 41 Māori, losing six of their own men.

Bishop George Selwyn, as garrison chaplain, had been told on 12 February that women, children and elderly would be taking refuge at unfortified and undefended Rangiaowhia, and had been asked to communicate that with Cameron. Kingitanga leaders understood they would be unharmed. There were about 200 Ngati-Apakura and Ngati-Hinetu people at Rangiaowhia, supplying food to the garrisons at Paterangi &quot;pā&quot;.

Cameron, meanwhile, was attracting sharp criticism from both the colonist press and Grey himself about the lack of progress in the eight weeks since Ngāruawāhia&#x27;s capture. On the night of 20 February, he set out on the narrow bush track to bypass Paterangi with 1230 men led by one of his guides and the Forest Rangers, leaving a large masking force in front of Paterangi. The force marched through rough bush in silence and complete darkness, passing within 1500 metres of the Paterangi &quot;pā&quot; without detection and arriving in Te Awamutu at dawn. They advanced to the village of Rangiaowhia, where they attacked about 100 mostly elderly men, and about 100 women and children. Most terrified villagers fled, a few shot at the troops, some sheltered in the churches, at least seven were burnt to death in their houses and at least one attempted to surrender, but was murdered by troops ignoring their orders. Women were raped and killed in front of children. About a dozen houses were burned down. The British claimed they killed 12 Māori, including two chiefs, and took 30 prisoners. Their own losses totaled five, including several officers. Some unofficial estimates suggest there were more than 100 Māori deaths. As the village was largely occupied by women, children and older men, the deaths have been regarded as murder, rather than an act of war.

When Cameron&#x27;s forces returned to Te Awamutu, the men of Rangiaowhia abandoned Paterangi, Pikopiko, and Rangiatea &quot;pā&quot; to defend their families and began rapidly digging a new trench on the crest of a ridge at Hairini, cutting the route between Te Awamutu and Rangiaowhia. The trench, fortified with a parapet and stakes, ended in swamp at one end and thick bush at the other. A thousand of Cameron&#x27;s men, supported by three Armstrong guns, advanced on an estimated 100 Māori manning the frontline on the morning of 22 February. With the Armstrong guns firing over their heads, the infantry, cavalry and Forest Rangers moved towards the defensive line before finally charging with bayonets, revolvers and sabres, driving out the Māori. The British forces pursued the Kingites to Rangiaowhia, where they looted the village and later built a redoubt. Belich claims the so-called &quot;Battle of Hairini&quot; was simply a delaying tactic by the Māori, allowing them to move as many supplies as they could from Rangiaowhia and the Paterangi line. He says the Kingites, by abandoning the Paterangi line, managed to save their army which otherwise would have been destroyed in an all-out pitched battle; Cameron&#x27;s decision to outflank the Paterangi line, meanwhile, was described as a &quot;brilliant&quot; strategy that forced his enemy out of one of its richest economic centres with minimal British losses, becoming the greatest British victory of the Waikato invasion. For Kingitanga supporters, who after the Rangiriri battle had been urged to fight in a &quot;civilised&quot; manner by the British, and had moved their families away from their fortifications to an undefended, open village, the assault on Rangiaowhia was an almost &quot;incomprehensible act of savagery&quot;.

The role of Bishop Selwyn in the Rangiaowhia attack is unclear. He came with the invading forces, but also helped with Māori burials. The wife and two daughters of Kereopa Te Rau were killed in the attack, and his sister was killed in defence of the Hairini line a few days later. Colonel Marmaduke Nixon, who had led the Rangiaowhia cavalry charge, was mortally wounded. His remains are buried at the Nixon memorial in Ōtāhuhu, Auckland. There were no memorials to the victims of Rangiaowhia until the 150th anniversary was commemorated in 2014 with the unveiling of a plaque. Historian Vincent O&#x27;Malley has noted that Cameron would later become disillusioned with the war, suggesting that his role in ordering the attack on non-combatants may have been the beginnings of his &quot;first pangs of remorse&quot;.

==Ōrākau==


Following the fall of the Paterangi line, Wiremu Tamihana, leading one of the two major Kingite divisions, retreated east to Maungatautari to block a British advance up the Waikato River into Ngāti Raukawa territory and Matamata beyond. Cameron remained at Rangiaowhia, preparing to pursue him. Rewi Maniapoto, with the other main division, moved south into the Hangitiki Valley to defend Ngati Maniapoto bases. Ngati Maniapoto fighters and their allies remained determined to continue the war, but were divided over their strategy: whether to guard the hinterland with large defensive systems on the fringes, or to challenge the nearby occupying forces with a new &quot;pā&quot;. Rewi deferred a decision until he could consult with Tamihana, the kingmaker, and set out with a small group to Tamihana&#x27;s stronghold near present-day Cambridge on the upper Waikato. On the way he encountered a group of about 140 of the dispersed Paterangi army, mainly warriors from distant Tūhoe and Ngāti Raukawa &quot;iwi&quot;. The Tūhoe chiefs urged Rewi to build a &quot;pā&quot; at the agricultural village of Ōrākau, near Kihikihi, to challenge the troops, explaining that their guns and ammunition had been carried a long distance and were &quot;too heavy to carry all this way for nothing&quot;. Although he strongly opposed the plan, convinced it would result in their defeat, Rewi relented—possibly in return for the loyalty they had shown in crossing the North Island to join the fight for his territory—and accompanied them back to Ōrākau, arriving about 28 March.

For Rewi, a skilled strategist and warrior, the major concerns about Ōrākau were that it had no immediate water supply and, sited on a low hill, overlooked by the nearby &quot;California&quot; ridge, 850m to the southwest, could also be easily encircled. The land immediately to the south of the pa was a series of low undulating hillocks leading to swamp. For two days the villagers, as well as Rewi&#x27;s forces and the new reinforcements, labored in shifts to strengthen the defences of the &quot;pā&quot;, located on a slight rise of land in the midst of peach groves. Measuring about 30 metres by 12 metres, the &quot;pā&quot; was enclosed within a rectangular redoubt and contained interior bunkers, trenches, firing apertures. The main parapet was just 1.2 metres high, the outer trench a metre deep and the entire system was surrounded by a post and three-rail fence. The &quot;pā&quot; was defended by between 200 and 250 warriors—mainly Tūhoe and Ngāti Raukawa—drawn from at least nine tribes, as well as about 50 women and children.

Early on 30 March two surveyors working at Kihikihi observed through a telescope construction of entrenchments at the Ōrākau pā and immediately passed the information to Brigadier General G. J. Carey, who had been left in charge of the British forces. Carey, keen to surprise the Kingites, immediately began organising an expedition and at midnight the first of three separate columns, comprising members of the 40th, 65th and 18th Royal Irish Regiments, as well as Forest Rangers and Waikato Militia, set out for Ōrākau with two Armstrong six-pounders, arriving before daybreak. The total force for the mission was 1120 men. The two cannons were set up on a small plateau 350m to the west and about the same height above the &quot;pā&quot;. They were shooting across the front of the 40th Regiment who were situated 250 m south of the &quot;pā&quot; behind a small hill.

===31 March – 1 April, days one and two===
Early on 31 March the first attack was made on Ōrākau, whose parapets and exterior fence was still incomplete. The Ōrākau garrison spotted the attacking force to their west just minutes before the bugle was sounded to charge and warriors were ordered by Rewi into the outer trenches. The Kingites held their fire until the attackers were within 50 metres, then fired in two volleys, halting the advance. Two more waves of attack were similarly repulsed, with several casualties, including officers.

Realising the strength of Ōrākau, Carey decided to encircle the &quot;pā&quot; and began shelling it from about 350 metres, though the design and construction methods of the bunkers neutralised the force of the bombardment. He then ordered a start on a shallow sap that zig-zagged towards its western face from a distance of about 120 metres. A party of Māori reinforcements appeared about 2 km to the east, but retreated, unable to break through the British lines. Sporadic shooting continued through the night, with the besieged occupants of Ōrākau chanting and singing.

By dawn the second day—with fog so thick the combatants could not see one another—the Ōrākau garrison realised they had exhausted their water supplies and most of their ammunition. Ngāti Maniapoto chief Winitana Tupotahi suggested at a &quot;runanga&quot;, or council of chiefs, that they abandon the &quot;pā&quot;, but Rewi rejected the proposal. At midday many attempted to break out of the &quot;pā&quot; through the cordon at the east, but were driven back twice, suffering the loss of one of their chiefs. One Kingite told Cowan: &quot;We were in better spirits after our fight in the open; nevertheless we realized that our position was hopeless, short of food and water, short of lead, and surrounded by soldiers many times outnumbering our garrison, and with big guns throwing shells into our defences.&quot; Further British reinforcements arrived, including a second company of Forest Rangers, taking the British strength to almost 1500. Shelling continued as the sap approached the &quot;pā&quot;, its progress slowed by accurate fire from the Kingites.

That night, Tupotahi suggested they make a breakout under cover of dark. Rewi supported the plan, but the &quot;runanga&quot; decided they should stay and fight. With ammunition now running very short, the Kingites—so parched they could not swallow their remaining food—began firing peach stones, 5 cm-long sections of apple tree branches and pieces of metal.

===2 April: day three===
Another &quot;runanga&quot; was held before dawn on 2 April and again Tupotahi urged them to break out. Though many of the chiefs remained steadfast in their refusal to retreat, Rewi insisted the effect of the water shortage was now so severe they had to break out, but urged they go out fighting. The plan was aborted when dawn broke and the fog lifted, removing their cover. Through the morning the British sap advanced close enough to the outer trenches of Ōrākau for hand-grenades to be thrown over the ramparts. At noon Cameron arrived with more men, bringing the besieging imperial and colonial force to 1800. One of the Armstrong guns was moved to the head of the sap and fired at the outwork of the &quot;pā&quot; about 30 metres away, breaching the wall. Under the combination of shells, hand grenades and rifle fire, Māori casualties began to climb rapidly.

Soon after arriving, Cameron, impressed by the courage of the garrison, decided to give them the opportunity to surrender. Two interpreters were sent to the head of the sap with a white flag and Major William Mair called out the offer in Māori, which was passed to Rewi, within the &quot;pā&quot;. Although there are several versions of Rewi&#x27;s reply, he is reputed to have declared through his messenger, &quot;Ka whawhai tonu ahau ki a koe, ake, ake&quot; (&quot;I shall fight you forever, and ever, and ever&quot;) When a shot was fired at Mair as he withdrew, grazing his shoulder, the British forces responded with a heavier hail of grenades, artillery and gunfire. The Ōrākau garrison repulsed two more attempts by the Waikato militia to rush the north-west outworks, but at 4:00 pm the chiefs, realising the end was near, decided to break out. Placing women and children in the middle of the group and their best warriors in front, the Māori broke through the earthworks at the south-east corner of the &quot;pā&quot; and ran downhill without opposition 200 metres towards a ridge to the south, behind which the some men of the 40th were sheltering. They then dropped down a sloping 10-metre bank, surprising members of the 40th Regiment, who formed the south eastern edge of the cordon before running for cover in a nearby swamp. The group, many of them holding empty shotguns or tomahawks, was pursued by sword-bearing cavalry and hundreds of soldiers who fired on and bayoneted the fleeing Māori; Forest Rangers kept up the chase until dusk. Back at Ōrākau, meanwhile, soldiers stormed the &quot;pā&quot; as the garrison fled, bayoneting and shooting many of the wounded, including women and children. One of the women was Hine-i-turama Ngatiki.

Sixteen of the British forces died in the three-day battle and 53 were wounded, some of them mortally; while estimates of Māori fatalities range from 80 to 160, with half of the casualties coming from the Urewera contingent. Another 26 wounded were taken prisoner. The bodies of the Māori were buried in mass graves in the trenches of Ōrākau (just to the north of the road opposite the existing memorial) and beside the nearby swamp to the south. Rewi escaped through the swamp, unharmed, escorted by a 12-man bodyguard.

The Māori saw Ōrākau as a defeat, but both Cameron and Grey were angered by the failure of the 40th Regiment to halt the Ōrākau breakout and kill Rewi, which deprived them of the crushing victory over the Kingites they desperately sought.

The general site of the battle is today marked by a memorial on Arapuni Road, 4 km east of Kihikihi, with the road running through the middle of what were the defences. The site of the &quot;pā&quot; is on private farmland and no traces of it are now visible. Plans have been proposed to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the battle in 2014, with a call made for a new memorial.

==Commissariat==
Belich has described the Waikato campaign as one of the best-prepared and best organised ever undertaken by the British Army, proving that many lessons had been learned from the logistical fiasco of the Crimean War. He said the Commissariat Transport Corps (CTC), established in mid-1861, almost two years before the invasion began, was the &quot;vital kernel&quot; because of its efforts in building the southern road and being a separate military supply train. Commissariat sourced much of its food from England and Australia and sent it along with other supplies up to 160 km into the interior via a combination of steamers, barges, bullocks and pack horses. The CTC had found the Otago pack saddle, devised in the Otago goldfields to prevent injury and ruin to horses carrying heavy loads, to be the best suited to their needs. In a report to the War Office, Commissary General Humphrey Stanley Herbert Jones described the CTC as &quot;the foundation of the whole service&quot;. The work of the commissariat helped ensure the sick rate of soldiers never rose above 5 percent—a rate far below that of the Crimean War a decade earlier, when 14 percent of the force was incapacitated.

==Aftermath==

Ōrākau was the last major battle of Cameron&#x27;s Waikato campaign. Leaving his captured territory occupied by troops, he resumed his preparations to assault one of the strongest of Tamihana&#x27;s &quot;pā&quot;, Te Tiki o te Ihingarangi, about 25 km northeast of Ōrākau near modern-day Lake Karapiro. The &quot;pā&quot; formed part of a long line of &quot;pā&quot; the Kingites called &quot;aukati&quot;, or boundary. Cameron assessed the &quot;pā&quot; as too strong to assault and incapable of outflanking. On 2 April he settled his troops in front of it, and prepared to shell it. After three days the Kingites abandoned the &quot;pā&quot;, but Cameron decided further effort in the region would be fruitless and withdrew, switching his focus to Tauranga. Land behind the &quot;aukati&quot; remained native territory, with Europeans warned they crossed it under threat of death. The area subsequently came to be known as the King Country.

In mid-1863 the New Zealand government began planning legislation designed to punish armed Māori resistance and aggression by widespread confiscation of their land, which would be given to colonial settlers. The New Zealand Settlements Act was passed in December 1863 and in 1865 Governor Grey confiscated more than 480,000 hectares of land from the Waikato–Tainui &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe) in the Waikato as punishment for their earlier &quot;rebellion&quot;.

Proclamations under the act were issued on 30 January 1865 for the seizure of the East Wairoa and West Pukekohe blocks for settlement and colonisation, followed by the Central Waikato district and the Māngere, Pukaki, Ihumata and Kerikeri blocks (16 May 1865). As the occupants were evicted from their land, their belongings were looted by colonial forces and neighbouring settlers, with houses ransacked, cattle seized and horses transported for sale in Auckland.

The war and confiscation of land caused heavy economic, social and cultural damage to Waikato-Tainui. King Tāwhiao and his people were forced to retreat into the heartland of Ngāti Maniapoto. The Maniapoto, by contrast, had been more zealous for war than the Waikato, yet suffered no loss of land because its territory was too remote to be of use to white settlers. The 1927 Royal Commission on Confiscated Land, chaired by senior supreme court judge Sir William Sim, concluded that although the government restored a quarter of the 1,202,172 acres (486,500 hectares) originally seized and paid almost £23,000 compensation, the Waikato confiscations had been &quot;excessive&quot;. The Waitangi Tribunal in 1985 declared the Tainui people of the Waikato had never rebelled, but had been forced into a defensive war.

In the early 1990s Tainui opted to bypass the Waitangi Tribunal and concluded a treaty claims settlement with the Crown through direct negotiation. In May 1995 the Crown signed a deed of settlement with Waikato–Tainui that included cash and land valued at $170 million. The settlement included an admission by the Crown that it had &quot;unjustly confiscated&quot; the land. It formally and publicly apologised to Waikato–Tainui and the Kingitanga for unjustly invading Waikato–Tainui lands, for sending imperial forces across the Mangataawhiri, and for the loss of life and the devastation of property that ensued. The Crown expressed profound regret and apologised unreservedly for the invasion and the crippling effects it had on the welfare of the Waikato-Tainui people. Queen Elizabeth II affirmed the apology of the Crown by signing the Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995 in the presences of the head of the Kingitanga, Māori Queen Dame Te Atairangikaahu. As a result of this settlement the Crown agreed to return as much land as possible to Waikato and to pay compensation, and said that it sought on behalf of all New Zealanders to atone for these acknowledged injustices, and to begin the process of healing and to enter a new age of co-operation with the Kingitanga and Waikato.

<text>Argentina has 23 provinces (, singular ) and one autonomous city, Buenos Aires, which serves as the federal capital, as determined by Congress.

The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions and exist under a federal system.

== History ==
During the War of Independence, cities and their surrounding areas became provinces through local councils (cabildos). This process was finalized during the Anarchy of the Year XX, forming the first 13 provinces.

Jujuy seceded from Salta in 1834, and the thirteen provinces became fourteen. After seceding for a decade, Buenos Aires Province accepted the 1853 Constitution of Argentina in 1861, and its capital city was made a federal territory in 1880.

A law from 1862 designated as national territories those territories under federal control but outside the frontiers of the provinces. In 1884 they served as bases for the establishment of the governorates of Misiones, Formosa, Chaco, La Pampa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego. The agreement about a frontier dispute with Chile in 1900 created the National Territory of Los Andes; its lands were incorporated into Jujuy, Salta and Catamarca in 1943. La Pampa and Chaco became provinces in 1951. Misiones did so in 1953, and Formosa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, in 1955. The last national territory, Tierra del Fuego, became the Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur Province in 1990. This province nominally includes Argentina&#x27;s claims to the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and to a segment of Antarctica that overlaps with the British and Chilean claims on that continent.

== Political organization ==

Argentina is a federation of twenty-three provinces and one autonomous city, Buenos Aires. Provinces are divided for administration purposes into departments and municipalities, except for Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into partidos and &quot;localidades&quot;. Buenos Aires City itself is divided into communes (&quot;comuna&quot;) and non-official neighbourhoods (&quot;barrios&quot;).

Provinces hold all the power that they chose not to delegate to the federal government; they must be representative commonwealths and must not contradict the Constitution. Beyond this, they are fully autonomous: they enact their own constitutions, freely organize their local governments, and own and manage their natural and financial resources. Thus, each province has its own set of provincial laws and justice system, a supreme court, a governor, an autonomous police force, and a congress; in eight provinces, the legislature is bicameral, comprising an upper chamber (the Senate) and a lower chamber (the House of Deputies), while in the remaining fifteen provinces and in Buenos Aires City, it is unicameral.

In case of sedition, insurrection, territorial invasion, or any other emerging threats against the laws of the nation on any province or the federal capital, the Congress has the authority to declare a federal intervention on the compromised district, even in the absence of a formal request by the affected part. When Congress is in recess and thus unable to intervene, the President is entitled to decree such intervention, but this executive order is subject to Congressional override upon the Houses&#x27; immediate reassembly. Once the intervention is declared the compromised district&#x27;s government is immediately dissolved—in whole or in part depending on Congressional decision—and the President appoints a representative or intervenor, who will serve for a short time until the emergency is solved. Since 1983 four provinces were intervened, namely Catamarca, Corrientes (twice), Santiago del Estero (twice), and Tucumán.

During the 20th century, some provinces have had governments that were traditionally controlled by a single family (i.e. the Saadi family in Catamarca, or the Sapag family in Neuquén); in one case, it is still the same situation as of 2009: the province of San Luis was ruled almost without a break by the Rodríguez Saá family since December 1983.

Article 61 of the Constitution of the city of Buenos Aires states that &quot;&quot;Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and not accumulative. The foreign residents enjoy this right, with the correlative obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in this district, in the terms established by the law&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Alaska Highway (; also known as the Alaskan Highway, Alaska-Canadian Highway, or ALCAN Highway) was constructed during World War II to connect the contiguous United States to Alaska across Canada. It begins at the junction with a few Canadian highways in Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and runs to Delta Junction, Alaska, via Whitehorse, Yukon. When it was completed in 1942, it was about long, but in 2012, it was only . This is due to the realignments of the highway over the years, which has rerouted and straightened many sections. The highway opened to the public in 1948. Once legendary for being a rough, challenging drive, the highway is now paved over its entire length. Its component highways are British Columbia Highway 97, Yukon Highway 1, and Alaska Route 2.

An informal system of historic mileposts developed over the years to denote major stopping points. Delta Junction, at the end of the highway, makes reference to its location at &quot;Historic Milepost 1422&quot;. It is at this point that the Alaska Highway meets the Richardson Highway, which continues to the city of Fairbanks. This is often regarded, though unofficially, as the northwestern portion of the Alaska Highway, with Fairbanks at Historic Milepost 1520. Mileposts on this stretch of highway are measured from the port of Valdez on Prince William Sound, rather than the Alaska Highway. The Alaska Highway is popularly (but unofficially) considered part of the Pan-American Highway, which extends south (despite its discontinuity in Panama) to Argentina.

==History==

===Proposal===

Proposals for a highway to Alaska originated in the 1920s. Thomas MacDonald, director of the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads, dreamed of an international highway spanning the United States and Canada. In order to promote the highway, in 1933 Slim Williams originally traveled the proposed route by dogsled. Since much of the route would pass through Canada, support from the Canadian government was crucial. However, the Canadian government perceived no value in putting up the required funds to build the road, since the only part of Canada that would benefit was not more than a few thousand people in Yukon.

In 1929, the British Columbia government proposed a highway to Alaska to encourage economic development and tourism. American President Herbert Hoover appointed a board with American and three Canadian members to evaluate the idea. Its 1931 report supported the idea for economic reasons, but both American and Canadian members recognized that a highway would benefit the American military in Alaska. In 1933, the joint commission proposed the U.S. government contribute $2 million of the capital cost, with the $12 million balance borne by the Canadian and BC governments. The Great Depression and the Canadian government&#x27;s lack of support caused the project to not proceed.

When the United States approached Canada again in February 1936, the Canadian government refused to commit to spending money on a road connecting the United States. The Canadians also worried about the military implications, fearing that in a war between Japan and North America, the United States would use the road to prevent Canadian neutrality. During a June 1936 visit to Canada, President Franklin D. Roosevelt told Prime Minister W. L. M. King that a highway to Alaska through Canada could be important in quickly reinforcing the American territory during a foreign crisis. Roosevelt became the first American to publicly discuss the military benefits of a highway in an August speech in Chautauqua, New York. He again mentioned the idea during King&#x27;s visit to Washington in March 1937, suggesting that a $30 million highway would be helpful as part of a larger defense against Japan that would include, the Americans hoped, a larger Canadian military presence on the Pacific coast. Roosevelt remained a supporter of the highway, telling Cordell Hull in August 1937 that he wanted a road built as soon as possible. By 1938, Duff Pattullo, the BC premier, favored a route through Prince George. The U.S. offered either a $15 million interest-free loan, or to cover half the construction costs.

The December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and beginning of the Pacific Theater in World War II, coupled with Japanese threats to the west coast of North America and the Aleutian Islands, changed the priorities for both nations. On February 6, 1942, the construction of the Alaska Highway was approved by the United States Army and the project received the authorization from the U.S. Congress and Roosevelt to proceed five days later. The Northwest Service Command was created in September 1942. It was responsible for the construction and maintenance of the Alaska Highway, the operation of the railway between Skagway, Alaska and Whitehorse, and the Canol Project. Canada agreed to allow construction as long as the United States bore the full cost, and that the road and other facilities in Canada be turned over to Canadian authority after the war ended. It proved unimportant for the military because 99 percent of the supplies to Alaska during the war were sent by sea from San Francisco, Seattle, and Prince Rupert.


====Routing====
The Americans preferred Route A which, starting at Prince George, went northwest to 
Hazelton, along the Stikine River, by 
Atlin, Teslin and Tagish Lakes, and from Whitehorse, Yukon, to Fairbanks, Alaska, via the Tanana Valley. However, the route was vulnerable to possible enemy attack from the sea, experienced steep grades and heavy snowfall, and had no airbases along the way.

The Canadians favored Route B. This also started at Prince George, but followed the Rocky Mountain Trench up the valleys of the Parsnip and Finlay Rivers to Finlay Forks and Sifton Pass, then north to Frances Lake and the Pelly River in the Yukon. From there it went to Dawson City and down the Yukon Valley to connect the Richardson Highway to Fairbanks. The advantages of this inland route was the safe distance from enemy planes, and shorter with lower elevations enabling lower construction and maintenance costs. The disadvantages were the bypassing of respective airbases, and Whitehorse, the principal town in the Yukon. Optional variations in the southern portion of this route were via Vanderhoof to the west or Monkman Pass to the east.

Route C, the Prairie option, advocated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, was the only practical one. It was far enough inland from enemy planes and it linked the airfields of the Northwest Staging Route that conveyed lend-lease aircraft from the United States to the Soviet Union. This option encountered more level terrain, not ascending a pass over . There was also a railhead at Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and a winter trail from there to 
Fort Nelson, to the northwest. It followed the Rocky Mountain Trench toward Dawson City before turning west to Fairbanks.

===Construction===
The road was originally built mostly by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a supply route during World War II. In 1942, the Army Corps of Engineers assigned more than 10,000 men, about a third of whom were black soldiers, members of three newly formed African-American segregated regiments. There were four main thrusts in building the route: southeast from Delta Junction, Alaska, toward a linkup at Beaver Creek, Yukon; north then west from Dawson Creek (an advance group started from Fort Nelson, British Columbia, after traveling on winter roads on frozen marshland from railway stations on the Northern Alberta Railways); both east and west from Whitehorse after being ferried in via the White Pass and Yukon Route railway. The Army commandeered equipment of all kinds, including local riverboats, railway locomotives, and housing originally meant for use in southern California.

The official start of construction took place on March 9, 1942, after hundreds of pieces of construction equipment were moved on priority trains by the Northern Alberta Railways to the northeastern part of British Columbia near Mile 0 at Dawson Creek. Construction accelerated through the spring as the winter weather faded away and crews were able to work from both the northern and southern ends; they were spurred on after reports of the Japanese invasion of Kiska Island and Attu Island in the Aleutians. During construction the road was nicknamed the &quot;oil can highway&quot; by the work crews due to the large number of discarded oil cans and fuel drums that marked the road&#x27;s progress. The construction crew had also passed through an Indigenous village known as Champagne (Shadhala-ra) which they used to set up camp. Unfortunately, disease spread and nearly wiped out the indigenous population of the village. After the war, the survivors left the village to find work, leaving the location a ghost town.
On September 24, 1942, crews from both directions met at Mile 588 at what became named Contact Creek, at the British Columbia-Yukon border at the 60th parallel; the entire route was completed October 28, 1942, with the northern linkup at Mile 1202, Beaver Creek, and the highway was dedicated on November 20, 1942, at Soldier&#x27;s Summit.

Although it was completed on October 28, 1942, and its completion was celebrated at Soldier&#x27;s Summit on November 21 (and broadcast by radio, the exact outdoor temperature censored due to wartime concerns), the &quot;highway&quot; was not usable by general vehicles until 1943. Even then there were many steep grades, a poor surface, switchbacks to gain and descend hills, and few guardrails. Bridges, which progressed during 1942 from pontoon bridges to temporary log bridges, were replaced with steel bridges where necessary.

A replica log bridge, the Canyon Creek bridge, can be seen at the Aishihik River crossing; the bridge was rebuilt in 1987 and refurbished in 2005 by the Yukon government where it functions as a popular tourist attraction. The easing of the Japanese invasion threat resulted in no more contracts being given to private contractors for upgrading of specific sections.

Some of route between Burwash Landing and Koidern, Yukon, became nearly impassable in May and June 1943 due to permafrost thawing under the road and destroying the layer of delicate vegetation that held the road together. A corduroy road was built to restore the route, and corduroy still underlies old sections of highway in the area. Modern construction methods do not allow the permafrost to thaw, either by building a gravel berm on top or replacing the vegetation and soil immediately with gravel. The Burwash-Koidern section, however, is still a problem as the new highway built there in the late 1990s continues to experience frost heave.

&quot;Pincers on Japan&quot; and &quot;Look to the North&quot;, both 1944 productions, were National Film Board of Canada documentaries that depicted the construction of the Alaska Highway.

===Post war===
The original agreement between Canada and the United States regarding construction of the highway stipulated that its Canadian portion be turned over to Canada six months after the end of the war. This took place on April 1, 1946, when the U.S. Army transferred control of the road through Yukon and British Columbia to the Canadian Army, Northwest Highway System. The Alaskan section was completely paved during the 1960s. The lower 50 miles of the Canadian portion were paved in 1959, but the remainder was largely gravel. While the entire route is now completely paved (mostly with bituminous surface treatment), as late as the mid-1980s the highway still included sections of winding dusty road sandwiched between high quality reconstructed paved segments.

&quot;The Milepost&quot;, an extensive guide book to the Alaska Highway and other highways in Alaska and Northwest Canada, was first published in 1949 and continues to be published annually as the foremost guide to travelling the highway.

The British Columbia government owns the first of the highway, the only portion paved during the late 1960s and 1970s. Public Works Canada manages the highway from Mile 82.6 (km 133) to Historic Mile 630. The Yukon government owns the highway from Historic Mile 630 to Historic Mile 1016 (from near Watson Lake to Haines Junction), and manages the remainder to the U.S. border at Historic Mile 1221. The State of Alaska owns the highway within that state (Mile 1221 to Mile 1422).

The Alaska Highway was built for military purposes and its route was not ideal for postwar development of northern Canada. Rerouting in Canada has shortened the highway by about since 1947, mostly by eliminating winding sections and sometimes by bypassing residential areas. The historic milepost markings are therefore no longer accurate but are still important as local location references. Some old sections of the highway are in use as local roads, while others are left to deteriorate and still others are plowed up. Four sections form local residential streets in Whitehorse and Fort Nelson, and others form country residential roadways outside of Whitehorse. Although Champagne, Yukon was bypassed in 2002, the old highway is still completely in service for that community until a new direct access road is built.

Rerouting continues, expected to continue in the Yukon through 2009, with the Haines Junction-Beaver Creek section covered by the Canada-U.S. Shakwak Agreement. The new Donjek River bridge was opened September 26, 2007, replacing a 1952 bridge. Under Shakwak, U.S. federal highway money is spent for work done by Canadian contractors who win tenders issued by the Yukon government. The Shakwak Project completed the Haines Highway upgrades in the 1980s between Haines Junction and the Alaska Panhandle, then funding was stalled by Congress for several years.

&quot;The Milepost&quot; shows the Canadian section of the highway now to be about , but the first milepost inside Alaska is 1222. The actual length of the highway inside Alaska is no longer clear because rerouting, as in Canada, has shortened the route, but unlike Canada, mileposts in Alaska are not recalibrated. The BC and Yukon governments and Public Works Canada have recalibrated kilometre posts. The latest BC recalibration was carried out in 1990; using its end-point at the border at Historic Mile 630, the Yukon government has recalibrated in three stages: in 2002, from Mile 630 to the west end of the Champagne revision; in fall 2005, to a point just at the southeast shore of Kluane Lake, and in fall 2008, to the border with Alaska.

There are historical mileposts along the B.C. and Yukon sections of the highway, installed in 1992, that note specific locations, although the posts no longer represent accurate driving distance. There are 80 mileposts in B.C., 70 in Yukon and 16 in Alaska with a simple number marker of the original mile distance. There are 31 &quot;historic signs&quot; in B.C., 22 in Yukon and 5 in Alaska, identifying the significance of the location. There are 18 interpretive panels in B.C., 14 in Yukon and 5 in Alaska which give detailed text information at a turn-off parking area.

The portion of the Alaska Highway in Alaska is designated Alaska Route 2. In Yukon, it is Highway 1 (designated in 1968) and in British Columbia, Highway 97. The portion of the Alaska Highway in Alaska is also unsigned Interstate A-1 and unsigned Interstate A-2.

===Route markings===
The Canadian section of the road was delineated with mileposts, based on the road as it was in 1947, but over the years, reconstruction steadily shortened the distance between some of those mileposts. In 1978, metric signs were placed on the highway, and the mileposts were replaced with kilometre posts at the approximate locations of a historic mileage of equal value, e.g. km post 1000 was posted about where historical Mile 621 would have been posted.

As reconstruction continues to shorten the highway, the kilometre posts, at intervals, were recalibrated along the B.C. section of road to reflect the driving distances in 1990. The section of highway covered by the 1990 recalibration has since been rendered shorter by further realignments, such as near Summit Pass and between Muncho Lake and Iron Creek.
Based on where those values left off, new Yukon kilometre posts were erected in fall 2002 between the B.C. border and the west end of the new bypass around Champagne, Yukon; in 2005, additional recalibrated posts continued from there to the east shore of Kluane Lake near Silver City; and in fall 2008, from Silver City to the boundary with Alaska. Old kilometre posts, based on the historic miles, remained on the highway, after the first two recalibrations, from those points around Kluane Lake to the Alaska border. The B.C. and Yukon sections also have a small number of historic mileposts, printed on oval-shaped signs, at locations of historic significance; these special signs were erected in 1992 on the occasion of the highway&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

The Alaska portion of the highway is still marked by mileposts at intervals, although they no longer represent accurate driving distance, due to reconstruction.
The historic mileposts are still used by residents and businesses along the highway to refer to their location, and in some cases are also used as postal addresses.
The community Wonowon, British Columbia, is named by its location at mile 101, spoken &quot;one-oh-one&quot;.

Residents and travelers, and the government of the Yukon, do not use &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; to refer to direction of travel on the Yukon section, even though this is the predominant bearing of the Yukon portion of the highway; &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; are used, referring to the south (Dawson Creek) and north (Delta Junction) termini of the highway. This is an important consideration for travelers who may otherwise be confused, particularly when a westbound travel routes southwestward or even due south to circumvent a natural obstacle such as Kluane Lake.

Some B.C. sections west of Fort Nelson also route more east-to-west, with southwest bearings in some section; again, &quot;north&quot; is used in preference to &quot;west&quot;.

Since 1949 &quot;The Milepost&quot;, an exhaustive guide to the Alaska Highway and all other routes through the region, has been published each year.

===Proposed U.S. Route 97 designation===
The portion of the Alaska Highway in Alaska was planned to become part of the United States Numbered Highway System and to be signed as part of U.S. Route 97 (US 97). In 1953, the British Columbia government renumbered a series of highways to Highway 97 between the U.S. border at Osoyoos, US 97&#x27;s northern terminus, and Dawson Creek. The Alaska International Rail and Highway Commission lobbied for the designation of Highway 97 from Fairbanks to Mexico City in the late 1950s. Certain prior editions of United States Geological Survey topographic maps, mostly published during the 1950s, bore the US 97 highway shield along or near portions of the current AK-2. In 1964, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved an extension of US 97 from the Yukon border to Fairbanks along AK-2, conditional to Yukon renumbering its portion of the Alaska Highway; the Yukon government declined to renumber its portion of the highway and approval was withdrawn in 1968.

==Route description==


The pioneer road completed in 1942 was about from Dawson Creek to Delta Junction. The Army then turned the road over to the Public Roads Administration (PRA), which then began putting out section contracts to private road contractors to upgrade selected sections of the road. These sections were upgraded, with removal of excess bends and steep grades; often, a traveler could identify upgraded sections by seeing the telephone line along the PRA-approved route alignment. When the Japanese invasion threat eased, the PRA stopped putting out new contracts. Upon hand-off to Canada in 1946, the route was from Dawson Creek to Delta Junction.
The route follows a northwest then northward course from Dawson Creek to Fort Nelson. On October 16, 1957, a suspension bridge crossing the Peace River just south of Fort St. John collapsed. A new bridge was built a few years later. At Fort Nelson, the road turns west and crosses the Rocky Mountains, before resuming a westward course at Coal River. The highway crossed the Yukon-BC border nine times from Mile 590 to Mile 773, six of those crossings were from Mile 590 to Mile 596. After passing the south end of Kluane Lake, the highway follows a north-northwest course to the Alaska border, then northwest to the terminus at Delta Junction.

Postwar rebuilding has not shifted the highway more than from the original alignment, and in most cases, by less than . It is not clear if it still crosses the Yukon-BC border six times from Mile 590 to Mile 596.

===Interstate Highway System===
The Alaska portion of the Alaska Highway is an unsigned part of the Interstate Highway System east of Fairbanks. The entire length of Interstate A-2 follows Route 2 from the George Parks Highway (Interstate A-4) junction in Fairbanks to Tok, east of which Route 2 carries Interstate A-1 off the Tok Cut-Off Highway to the international border. Only a short piece of the Richardson Highway in Fairbanks is built to freeway standards.

<text>The Milepost is an extensive guide book covering Alaska, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and British Columbia. It was first published in 1949 as a guide about traveling along the Alaska Highway, often locally referred to as &quot;The ALCAN&quot;. It has since expanded to cover all major highways in the northwest corner of North America, including the Alaska Marine Highway. It is updated annually.

==History==
&quot;The Milepost&quot; is packaged and distributed like a book (2008 edition: ), but like the Yellow Pages it includes paid advertising. The original 1949 edition was a mere 72 pages, by 2014 it had expanded to 752 pages, detailing every place a traveler might eat, sleep, or just pull off the road for a moment on all of the highways of northwestern North America. In addition to the paid ads, descriptions are provided of interesting hikes or side trip drives near the highways, campgrounds, and other public facilities, as well as short histories of most of the settlements on the highways. Newer additions include special sections on selected areas popular with tourists, such as the Kenai Peninsula. It is also exhaustively cross-indexed and maps and charts are provided so that travelers can determine the total driving distance between any two points covered by the guide.

==Publishing==
Since 1997 &quot;The Milepost&quot; has been published by Morris Communications and currently shares publishing offices with &quot;Alaska&quot; magazine. Beginning in 2009, The Milepost is also available in an interactive digital format or download.

<text>Klaus Sperber (January 24, 1944 – August 6, 1983), known professionally as Klaus Nomi, was a German countertenor noted for his wide vocal range and an unusual, otherworldly stage persona.

In the 1970s, Nomi immersed himself in the East Village art scene. He was known for his bizarre and visionary theatrical live performances, heavy make-up, unusual costumes, and a highly stylized signature hairdo that flaunted a receding hairline. His songs were equally unusual, ranging from synthesizer-laden interpretations of classical opera to post-punk covers of 1960s pop standards like Chubby Checker&#x27;s &quot;The Twist&quot; and Lou Christie&#x27;s &quot;Lightnin&#x27; Strikes&quot;. Nomi was one of David Bowie&#x27;s backing singers for a 1979 performance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==Biography==

=== Early life and career ===
Klaus Nomi was born Klaus Sperber in Immenstadt, Bavaria, on January 24, 1944. He was raised by his single mother, Bettina Sperber, who had fled Essen, Rhine Province, for the Allgäu due to Allied bombing during World War II. His father was a soldier in the German Army with whom Bettina had a brief relationship during his furlough; he died from influenza before Nomi&#x27;s birth. At age four, he and his mother moved back to the Ruhr, first to Fröndenberg before returning to Essen. Nomi grew up listening to classical music, gaining an interest in opera from listening to soprano Maria Callas over the radio, but also became fascinated with pop rock, buying Elvis Presley records with money he stole from his mother. Inspired by Callas, he developed a six octave vocal range and in the mid-1960s, he moved to West Berlin to study at Berlin University of the Arts, but as the school did not offer countertenor courses at the time, he trained to be a baritone. As he did not believe that earning a living on a musical career alone was feasible, Nomi took an apprenticeship as a pastry chef and worked as an usher at the Deutsche Oper, where he sang for the other ushers and maintenance crew on stage in front of the fire curtain after performances. He also sang opera arias at the Berlin gay discothèque , under the stage name &quot;Renata Castrata&quot;.

Nomi emigrated to New York City in 1972. He did some off-Broadway theater work and operated a pastry shop as a day job. In 1977, Nomi appeared in a satirical camp production of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; at Charles Ludlam&#x27;s Ridiculous Theater Company as the Rheinmaidens and the Wood Bird. In October 1978, he took the artistic name &quot;NOMI&quot;, initially as a mononym before rendering it as &quot;Nomi&quot; and adopting it as a last name. It stood as an anagram for &quot;omni&quot; (&quot;all&quot; or &quot;every&quot;), after the then-newly released science fiction magazine Omni.

=== Music career ===
Nomi came to the attention of the East Village art scene on November 2, 1978 with his performance in &quot;New Wave Vaudeville&quot;, a four-night event at Irving Plaza MC&#x27;d by artist David McDermott. Dressed in a skin-tight spacesuit with a clear plastic cape, Nomi sang the aria &quot;Mon cœur s&#x27;ouvre à ta voix&quot; (&quot;My heart opens to your voice&quot;) from Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; opera &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;. The performance ended with a chaotic crash of strobe lights, smoke bombs, and loud electronic sound effects as Nomi backed away into the smoke. Joey Arias recalled: &quot;I still get goose pimples when I think about it ... It was like he was from a different planet and his parents were calling him home. When the smoke cleared, he was gone.&quot; After that performance Nomi was invited to perform at clubs all over New York City.

At the New Wave Vaudeville show Nomi met Kristian Hoffman, a songwriter for the Mumps. Hoffman was a performer and MC in the second incarnation of New Wave Vaudeville and a close friend of Susan Hannaford and Tom Scully, who produced the show, and Ann Magnuson, who directed it. Anya Phillips, then manager of James Chance and the Contortions, suggested Nomi and Hoffman form a band. Hoffman became Nomi&#x27;s de facto musical director, assembling a band that included Page Wood from another New Wave vaudeville act, Come On, and Joe Katz, who was concurrently in The Student Teachers, the Accidents, and The Mumps.

Hoffman helped Nomi choose his pop covers, including the Lou Christie song &quot;Lightnin&#x27; Strikes&quot;. Hoffman wrote several pop songs with which Nomi is closely identified: &quot;The Nomi Song&quot;, &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, &quot;After The Fall&quot;, and &quot;Simple Man&quot;, the title song of Nomi&#x27;s second RCA French LP. This configuration of the Klaus Nomi band performed at Manhattan clubs, including several performances at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, Danceteria, Hurrah and the Mudd Club. He also appeared on Manhattan Cable&#x27;s TV Party.

Disagreements with the management Nomi engaged led to the dissolution of this band, and Nomi continued without them. In the late 1970s, while performing at Club 57, The Mudd Club, the Pyramid Club, and other venues, Nomi assembled various up-and-coming models, singers, artists, and musicians to perform live with him, including Joey Arias, Keith Haring, John Sex and Kenny Scharf. He was briefly involved with Jean-Michel Basquiat, then known for his graffiti art as SAMO.

Nomi and Arias were at the Mudd Club when they were introduced to David Bowie, who hired them as performers and backing singers for his appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on December 15, 1979. They performed &quot;TVC 15&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, and &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;. During the performance of &quot;TVC 15&quot;, Nomi and Arias dragged around a large prop pink poodle with a television screen in its mouth. Nomi was so impressed with the plastic quasi-tuxedo suit that Bowie wore during &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; that he commissioned one for himself. He wore the suit on the cover of his self-titled album, as well as during a number of his music videos. Nomi wore his variant of the outfit, in monochromatic black-and-white with spandex and makeup to match, until the last few months of his life.

Nomi played a supporting role as a Nazi official in Anders Grafstrom&#x27;s 1980 underground film &quot;The Long Island Four&quot;.

The 1981 rock documentary film &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot; features Nomi&#x27;s live performance of &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;. His performance of &quot;Mon cœur s&#x27;ouvre à ta voix&quot; was used for the closing credits. In the liner notes of Nomi&#x27;s 1981 self-titled record, 666 Fifth Avenue was listed as the contact address.

He released his second album, &quot;Simple Man&quot;, in November 1982. He also collaborated with producer Man Parrish, appearing on Parrish&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Man Parrish&quot; as a backup vocalist on the track &quot;Six Simple Synthesizers&quot;.

In the last several months of his life, Nomi changed his focus to operatic pieces and adopted a Baroque era operatic outfit complete with full collar as his typical onstage attire. The collar helped cover the outbreaks of Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma on his neck, one of the numerous AIDS-related diseases Nomi developed toward the end of his life.

&quot;Za Bakdaz&quot;, a suite of home-studio recordings circa 1979 restored by Page Wood and George Elliott, was released posthumously in 2007.

=== Illness and death ===
Nomi died at the Sloan Kettering Hospital Center in New York City on August 6, 1983, as a result of complications from AIDS. He was one of the earliest known figures from the arts community to die from the illness. Nomi&#x27;s close friend Joey Arias was executor of his estate. Nomi&#x27;s ashes were scattered in New York City.

==Legacy==
Filmmaker Andrew Horn and writer Jim Fouratt consider Nomi an important part of the 1980s East Village scene, which was a hotbed of development for punk rock music, the visual arts, and the avant-garde. Although Nomi&#x27;s work had not yet met with national commercial success at the time of his death, he garnered a cult following, mainly in New York and in France. Andrew Horn&#x27;s 2004 feature documentary about Nomi&#x27;s life, &quot;The Nomi Song&quot;, which was released by Palm Pictures, helped spur renewed interest in the singer, including an art exhibit in San Francisco at the New Langton Arts gallery and one in Milan at the Res Pira Lab, which subsequently moved to Berlin&#x27;s Strychnin Gallery, called &quot;Do You Nomi?&quot; New music pieces inspired by Nomi were commissioned by the gallery for a variety of European musicians, including Ernesto Tomasini.

===In popular culture===

In 2001, German pop duo Rosenstolz and English singer Marc Almond recorded a cover version of &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;. Garbage used his &quot;Valentine’s Day&quot; song as the basis for their 2012 &quot;Beloved Freak&quot;.

Nomi makes an appearance in Derf Backderf&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Punk Rock and Trailer Parks,&quot; released in 2008.

Rush Limbaugh would degrade LGBTQ+ people with his Gay Community Update. During that portion of the show, Nomi&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot; would play in the background. 

Timur and the Dime Museum covered Nomi on their &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; audition. In 2023, Timur and Matthew Setzer premiered a musical &quot;Klaus from Space&quot; curated by composer of Nomi&#x27;s hits, Kristian Hoffman at in Rotterdam, described by Theaterkrant critic as &quot;This reincarnation of Klaus Nomi shows serious feelings beneath the glitz and kitsch.&quot;

In the film &quot;Suspiria&quot; (2018), Nomi singing &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; can be heard in the background on the radio in the room of another dancer.

Nomi makes an appearance in the Adult Swim cartoon &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; in the 2006 season 2 closing episode &quot;Showdown at Cremation Creek.&quot; He is portrayed as one of two bodyguard henchmen of the leader of the villainous organization the Guild of Calamitous Intent, The Sovereign (shown to be David Bowie in the episode, or at least taking his form). The henchmen (the other being Iggy Pop) seemingly assassinate The Sovereign (Nomi shown to have flight and a sonic scream as superpowers), only to be duped and later killed by him.

He made an appearance on &quot;The Special Without Brett Davis&quot;&#x27; &quot;TV Party&quot; homage.

The Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin staged a mixture of drama, opera and performance about Klaus Nomi&#x27;s life and death under the title “Don&#x27;t You Nomi?” in the 2023/2024 season. Various songs by Klaus Nomi were interpreted by the German countertenor Nils Wanderer.

<text>The 1964 Alaska earthquake, also known as the Great Alaska earthquake and Good Friday earthquake, occurred at 5:36 PM AKST on Good Friday, March 27, 1964. Across south-central Alaska, ground fissures, collapsing structures, and tsunamis resulting from the earthquake caused about 139 deaths.

Lasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds, the magnitude 9.2–9.3 megathrust earthquake remains the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in North America, and the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900. of fault ruptured at once and moved up to , releasing about 500 years of stress buildup. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by . Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as , requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.

In Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there. The survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from Florida and Texas.

==Geology==

On March 27, 1964, at 5:36 p.m. AKST (March 28, at 3:36 a.m. UTC), a fault between the Pacific and North American plates ruptured near College Fjord in Prince William Sound. The epicenter of the earthquake was north of Prince William Sound, east of Anchorage and west of Valdez. The focus occurred at a depth of approximately . Ocean floor shifts created large tsunamis (up to in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage. Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage. Vertical displacement of up to occurred, affecting an area of within Alaska.

Studies of ground motion have led to a peak ground acceleration estimate of 0.14–0.18 &quot;g&quot;. The earthquake was assigned a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of X (&quot;Extreme&quot;). Shaking was felt across much of Alaska and parts of western Yukon and British Columbia in Canada.

The Alaska earthquake was a subduction zone (megathrust) earthquake, caused by an oceanic plate sinking under a continental plate. The fault responsible was the Aleutian Megathrust, a reverse fault caused by a compressional force. This caused much of the uneven ground which is the result of ground shifted to the opposite elevation. Uplift occurred across from southern Kodiak to Prince William Sound and further east of the sound. The maximum uplift was in Montague Island, where the ground was raised relative to sea level. The uplift also affected Kodiak, Sitkalidak, and Sitkinak islands. Subsidence was observed for from north and west of the sound, in Chugach Mountains, most of Kenai Peninsula, and almost all the Kodiak Island group.

==Tsunami==

Two types of tsunami were produced by this subduction zone earthquake. There was a tectonic tsunami produced in addition to about 20 smaller and local tsunamis. These smaller tsunamis were produced by submarine and subaerial landslides and were responsible for the majority of the tsunami damage. Tsunami waves were noted in over 20 countries, including Peru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan, Mexico, and in the continent of Antarctica. The largest tsunami wave was recorded in Shoup Bay, Alaska, with a height of about .

==Death toll, damage, and casualties==


As a result of the earthquake, 139 people are believed to have died: Fifteen died as a result of the earthquake itself and another 124 died from the subsequent tsunamis in Alaska, Oregon, and California. Five died from the tsunami in Oregon, and 13 died from the tsunami in California, mostly in or near Crescent City. Property damage was estimated at $116 million ($ million in dollars).

===Anchorage area===
Most damage occurred in Anchorage, northwest of the epicenter. Anchorage was not hit by tsunamis, but downtown Anchorage was heavily damaged, and parts of the city built on sandy bluffs overlying &quot;Bootlegger Cove clay&quot; near Cook Inlet, most notably the Turnagain neighborhood, suffered landslide damage. The neighborhood lost 75 houses in the landslide, and the destroyed area has since been turned into Earthquake Park. The Government Hill school suffered from the Government Hill landslide, leaving it in two jagged, broken pieces. Land overlooking the Ship Creek valley near the Alaska Railroad yards also slid, destroying many acres of buildings and city blocks in downtown Anchorage. Most other areas of the city were only moderately damaged. The concrete control tower at Anchorage International Airport collapsed, killing the controller on the top floor, as well as trapping two cooks on the first floor, who were later rescued.

One house on W. 10th Avenue suffered peripheral damage, but only one block away the recently completed (and still unoccupied) Four Seasons Building on Ninth Avenue collapsed completely, with the concrete elevator shafts sticking up out of the rubble like a seesaw.

The hamlets of Girdwood and Portage, located southeast of central Anchorage on the Turnagain Arm, were destroyed by subsidence and subsequent tidal action. Girdwood was relocated inland and Portage was abandoned. About of the Seward Highway sank below the high-water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised and rebuilt in 1964–66.

===Elsewhere in Alaska===
Most coastal towns in the Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, and Kodiak Island areas, especially the major ports of Seward, Whittier and Kodiak were heavily damaged by a combination of seismic activity, subsidence, post-quake tsunamis and/or earthquake-caused fires. Valdez with 32 dead was not totally destroyed, but after three years, the town relocated to higher ground west of its original site. Some Alaska Native villages, including Chenega and Afognak, were destroyed or damaged. The earthquake caused the ballistic missile detection radar of Clear Air Force Station to go offline for six minutes, the only unscheduled interruption in its operational history. Near Cordova, the Million Dollar Bridge crossing the Copper River also suffered damage, with Span #4 slipping off its pylon and collapsing. The community of Girdwood was also confined to the southern side of the Seward Highway when water rushed into Turnagain Arm and flooded or destroyed any buildings left standing to the north of the highway. Only the ground immediately along the highway and that on the north side of the road dropped, prompting geologists to speculate that Girdwood may rest upon an ancient cliff face covered by thousands of years of sediment and glacial deposits.

===Canada===
A wave reached Prince Rupert, British Columbia, just south of the Alaska Panhandle, about three hours after the earthquake. The tsunami then reached Tofino, on the exposed west coast of Vancouver Island, and traveled up a fjord to hit Port Alberni twice, washing away 55 homes and damaging 375 others. The towns of Hot Springs Cove, Zeballos, and Amai also saw damage. The damage in British Columbia was estimated at CA$10 million ($ in Canadian dollars or $ in US dollars).

===Elsewhere===
Ten people were killed by the tsunami in Crescent City, California, and one other man was killed near Requa, California after being swept out to sea while fishing in the Klamath River. Four children were killed while camping with their parents on the Oregon coast at Beverly Beach State Park. An additional death that is sometimes attributed to the tsunami took place in Bolinas, California; a fisherman wading into a seaside channel at Duxbury Point was swept into the ocean by a strong surge that took place 13 hours after the initial tidal surge. Crescent City was particularly hard-hit, with 30 blocks destroyed, representing half of the city&#x27;s waterfront business district. The total damage to Crescent City was estimated at $7.4 million ($76 million in 2025 dollars). Other coastal towns and harbors in the Pacific Northwest, California, and Hawaii were damaged, often extensively. Damage to harbors and boats occurred as far south as Long Beach. Effects of the earthquake were even noted as far east as Freeport, Texas, where tide gauges recorded waves similar to seismic surface waves. Seiches were detected in wells in countries around the world, including England, Namibia, and Australia.

==Aftershocks==
There were hundreds of aftershocks in the first weeks following the main shock. In the first day alone, eleven major aftershocks were recorded with a magnitude greater than 6.0. Nine more struck over the next three weeks. In all, thousands of aftershocks occurred in the months following the quake, and smaller aftershocks continued to strike the region for more than a year.
==Recovery efforts==
Alaska had never experienced a major disaster in a highly populated area before, and had very limited resources for dealing with the effects of such an event. In Anchorage, at the urging of geologist Lidia Selkregg, the City of Anchorage and the Alaska State Housing Authority appointed a team of 40 scientists, including geologists, soil scientists, and engineers, to assess the damage done by the earthquake to the city. The team, called the Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group, was headed by Dr. Ruth A. M. Schmidt, a geology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The team of scientists came into conflict with local developers and downtown business owners who wanted to immediately rebuild; the scientists wanted to identify future dangers to ensure that rebuilt infrastructure would be safe. The team produced a report on May 8, 1964, just a little more than a month after the earthquake.

The United States military, which has a large active presence in Alaska, also stepped in to assist within moments of the end of the quake. The U.S. Army rapidly re-established communications with the lower 48 states, deployed troops to assist the citizens of Anchorage, and dispatched a convoy to Valdez. On the advice of military and civilian leaders, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared all of Alaska a major disaster area the day after the quake.

The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard deployed ships to isolated coastal communities to assist with immediate needs. Bad weather and poor visibility hampered air rescue and observation efforts the day after the quake, but on Sunday the 29th the situation improved and rescue helicopters and observation aircraft were deployed. A military airlift immediately began shipping relief supplies to Alaska, eventually delivering of food and other supplies.

Broadcast journalist Genie Chance assisted in recovery and relief efforts, staying on the KENI air waves over Anchorage for more than 24 continuous hours as the voice of calm from her temporary post within the Anchorage Public Safety Building. She was effectively designated as the public safety officer by the city&#x27;s police chief. Chance provided breaking news of the catastrophic events that continued to develop following the magnitude 9.2 earthquake, and she served as the voice of the public safety office, coordinating response efforts, connecting available resources to needs around the community, disseminating information about shelters and prepared food rations, passing messages of well-being between loved ones, and helping to reunite families.

In the longer term, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led the effort to rebuild roads, clear debris, and establish new townsites for communities that had been completely destroyed, at a cost of $110 million. The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center was formed as a direct response to the disaster. Federal disaster relief funds paid for reconstruction as well as financially supporting the devastated infrastructure of Alaska&#x27;s government, spending hundreds of millions of dollars that helped keep Alaska financially solvent until the discovery of massive oil deposits at Prudhoe Bay. At the order of the U.S. Defense Department, the Alaska National Guard founded the Alaska Division of Emergency Services to respond to any future disasters.

<text>Numa Droz (27 January 1844 – 15 December 1899) was a Swiss politician and member of the Swiss Federal Council (1875–1892). Born in La Chaux-de-Fonds, he was elected to cantonal government of Neuchâtel in 1871 and to the Swiss Council of States in 1872.

On 18 December 1875, he was elected to the Swiss Federal Council (becoming the youngest Federal Councillor ever at age 31) and handed over office on 31 December 1892. He was affiliated to the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland. He was elected President of Switzerland in 1881 and 1887. In 1887, he was considered as a potential civil governor of Crete but he declined. 

During his office time he held the following departments:
*Department of Home Affairs (1876–1878)
*Department of Trade and Agriculture (1879–1880)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1881)
*Department of Trade and Agriculture (1882–1886)
*Political Department as President of the Confederation (1887)
*Department of Foreign Affairs (1888–1892)

Droz has been described as a &quot;man of progress&quot; and &quot;one of Switzerland&#x27;s major political figures&quot;. 
He was appointed by Swiss Government for presiding the ALAI conferences following of which the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works was concluded in 1886. &quot;Numa Droz was an admirable choice for this role from the point of view of authors, as he had a strong interest in copyright matters, and had, in an article ... declared himself in favour of an international convention on literary and artistic property.&quot; He was to play a crucial role in the realization of the final convention. In 1898, he suggested a railway over the Bernina Pass which eventually was to be completed after his death. 

He was a radical democrat who clashed with Bismarck over a police spying case, the Wohlgemuth Affair, in 1889. He died in Bern in 1899. 

In La Chaux-de-Fonds a street (&quot;rue Numa-Droz&quot;, the longest in the town) and in Neuchâtel a square (&quot;place Numa-Droz&quot;) are named after him. A statue by Charles l&#x27;Eplattenier which was erected by the station is at present being renovated and will be placed on Rue Numa-Droz in the autumn of 2012.

He was also the chairman of the Military Court of Cassation. In 1880 Lachenal was elected to the Grand Council (Grand Conseil), to which he belonged until 1892. Soon he was one of the most influential politicians of the radical faction. Over time, he turned to a policy of reconciliation. His commitment to social policy finally led to the formation of an alliance with the socialists. In 1881, the Grand Council elected Lachenal into the Council of States. there he spoke in particular on topics such as military, customs and finance. After the parliamentary elections in 1884, he moved to the National Council where he was the President in 1885 and 1891.

He was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 15 December 1892 and handed over office on 31 December 1899. In 1896 he was elected President of the Swiss Confederation.

During his time in office he held the following departments:
* Department of Foreign Affairs (1893–1895)
* Political Department as President of the Confederation (1896)
* Department of Trade, Industry and Agriculture (1897)
* Department of Home Affairs (1898–1899)

&quot;Rue Adrien-Lachenal&quot; in Geneva and &quot;Avenue Adrien-Lachenal&quot; in Versoix are named after him.

<text>MUSCULAR (DS-200B), located in the United Kingdom, is the name of a surveillance program jointly operated by Britain&#x27;s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) that was revealed by documents released by Edward Snowden and interviews with knowledgeable officials. GCHQ is the primary operator of the program. GCHQ and the NSA have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect the data centers of Yahoo! and Google. Substantive information about the program was made public at the end of October 2013.

== Overview ==

The programme is jointly run by:
* – Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) (United Kingdom)
* – U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)

MUSCULAR is one of at least four other similar programs that rely on a trusted 2nd party, programs which together are known as WINDSTOP. In a 30-day period from December 2012 to January 2013, MUSCULAR was responsible for collecting 181 million records. It was however dwarfed by another WINDSTOP program known (insofar) only by its code DS-300 and codename INCENSER, which collected over 14 billion records in the same period.

== Operational details ==

According to the leaked document the NSA&#x27;s acquisitions directorate sends millions of records every day from internal Yahoo! and Google networks to data warehouses at the agency&#x27;s headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland. The program operates via an access point known as DS-200B, which is outside the United States, and it relies on an unnamed telecommunications operator to provide secret access for the NSA and the GCHQ.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the MUSCULAR program collects more than twice as many data points (&quot;selectors&quot; in NSA jargon) compared to the better known PRISM. Unlike PRISM, the MUSCULAR program requires no (FISA or other type of) warrants.

Because of the huge amount of data involved, MUSCULAR has presented a special challenge to NSA&#x27;s Special Source Operations. For example, when Yahoo! decided to migrate a large amount of mailboxes between its data centers, the NSA&#x27;s PINWALE database (their primary analytical database for the Internet) was quickly overwhelmed with the data coming from MUSCULAR.

Closely related programmes are called INCENSER and TURMOIL. TURMOIL, belonging to the NSA, is a system for processing the data collected from MUSCULAR.

According to a post-it style note from the presentation, the exploitation relied on the fact that (at the time at least) data was transmitted unencrypted inside Google&#x27;s private cloud, with &quot;Google Front End Servers&quot; stripping and respectively adding back SSL from/to external connections. After the information about MUSCULAR was published by the press, Google announced that it was working on deploying encrypted communication between its datacenters.

== Reactions and countermeasures ==

In early November 2013, Google announced that it was encrypting traffic between its data centers. In mid-November, Yahoo! announced similar plans.

In December 2013, Microsoft announced similar plans and used the expression &quot;advanced persistent threat&quot; in their press release (signed-off by their top legal representative), which the press immediately interpreted as comparison of the NSA with the Chinese government-sponsored hackers.

Google engineer Brandon Downey stated the following on Google+:

<text>Product life-cycle management (PLM) is the succession of strategies by business management as a product goes through its life-cycle. The conditions in which a product is sold (advertising, saturation) changes over time and must be managed as it moves through its succession of stages.

==Goals==
The goals of product life cycle management (PLM) are to reduce time to market, improve product quality, reduce prototyping costs, identify potential sales opportunities and revenue contributions, maintain and sustain operational serviceability, and reduce environmental impacts at end-of-life. To create successful new products the company must understand its customers, markets and competitors. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) integrates people, data, processes and business systems. It provides product information for companies and their extended supply chain enterprise. PLM solutions help organizations overcome the increased complexity and engineering challenges of developing new products for the global competitive markets.

==Product life cycle==
The concept of product life cycle (PLC) concerns the life of a product in the market with respect to business/commercial costs and sales measures. The product life cycle proceeds through multiple phases, involves many professional disciplines, and requires many skills, tools and processes. PLC management makes the following three assumptions:
* Products have a limited life and thus every product has a life cycle.
* Product sales pass through distinct stages, each posing different challenges, opportunities, and problems to the seller.
* Products require different marketing, financing, manufacturing, purchasing, and human resource strategies in each life cycle stage.
Once the product is designed and put into the market, the offering should be managed efficiently for the buyers to get value from it. Before entering into any market complete analysis is carried out by the industry for both external and internal factors including the laws and regulations, environment, economics, cultural values and market needs. From the business perspective, as a good business, the product needs to be sold before it finishes its life. In terms of profitability, expiry may jolt the overall profitability of the business therefore there are few strategies, which are practiced to ensure that the product is sold within the defined period of maturity.

=== Extending the product life cycle===

Extending the product life cycle by improving sales, can be done through

* Advertising: Its purpose is to get additional audience and potential customers.
* Exploring and expanding to new markets: By conducting market research and offering the product (or some adapted form of it) to new markets, it is possible to get more customers.
* Price reduction: Many customers are attracted by price cuts and discount tags.
* Adding new features: Adding value to the product to enhance its usability or to attract the attention of a wider customer base.
* Packaging: New, attractive, useful or eco-friendly packaging influence the target customers.
* Changing customer consumption habits: Promoting new trends of consumption can increase the number of customers.
* Special promotions: Raising interest by offering Jackpot and other offers.
* Heightening interest: Many of the following things attract many customers who match certain profiles: Eco-friendly production processes, good work conditions, funding the efforts of non-profit organizations (cancer cure, anti-war efforts, refugees, GLTBI, environment and animal protection, etc.) and the like.

Something important to notice is that all these techniques rely on advertising to become known. Advertising needs the others to target other potential customers and not the same over and over again.

===Characteristics of PLC stages===
There are the following major product life cycle stages:
===Identifying PLC stages===
Identifying the stage of a product is an art more than a science, but it&#x27;s possible to find patterns in some of the general product features at each stage. Identifying product stages when the product is in transition is very difficult. More recently, it has been shown that user-generated contents (UGC) (e.g., in the form of online product reviews) has the potential to reveal buyer personality characteristics that can in turn be used to identify product life cycle stage.

<doc id="240454" wikidata="Q26416" url="?curid=240454" title="Snow bunting">
<text>The snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) is a passerine bird in the family Calcariidae. It is an Arctic specialist, with a circumpolar Arctic breeding range throughout the northern hemisphere. There are small isolated populations on a few high mountain tops south of the Arctic region, including the Cairngorms in central Scotland and the Saint Elias Mountains on the southern Alaska-Yukon border, as well as the Cape Breton Highlands. The snow bunting is the most northerly recorded passerine in the world.

==Taxonomy==
The snow bunting was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the buntings in the genus &quot;Emberiza&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Emberiza nivalis&quot;. He specified the locality as Lapland. It is now placed in the genus &quot;Plectrophenax&quot;, described in 1882 by the Norwegian born zoologist Leonhard Stejneger with the snow bunting as the type species. The genus name &quot;Plectrophenax&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;plektron&quot;, &quot;cock&#x27;s spur&quot;, and &quot;phenax&quot; &quot;imposter&quot;, and the specific &quot;nivalis&quot; is Latin for &quot;snow-white&quot;.

The snow bunting was formerly classified in the family Emberizidae, which included American sparrows, buntings, towhees and finches. All these species came into existence after a broad geologically recent radiation of passerine birds. However, it is now part of the narrower family Calcariidae, which also contains the longspurs. Despite the wide distribution of this species there are only very small differences between different phenotypes.

Four subspecies are accepted, which differ slightly in the plumage pattern of breeding males:
*&quot;P. n. nivalis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Arctic Europe, Arctic North America. Head white, rump mostly black with a small area of white.
*&quot;P. n. insulae&quot; Salomonsen, 1931 – Iceland, Faroe Islands, Scotland. Head white with a blackish collar, rump black.
*&quot;P. n. vlasowae&quot; Portenko, 1937 – Arctic Asia. Head white, rump mostly white.
*&quot;P. n. townsendi&quot; Ridgway, 1887 – Aleutian Islands, Kamchatka, coastal far eastern Siberia. As &quot;vlasowae&quot;, but slightly larger.

It is very closely related to the Beringian McKay&#x27;s bunting (&quot;Plectrophenax hyperboreus&quot;), which differs in having even more white in the plumage. Hybrids between the two occur in Alaska, and they have been considered conspecific by some authors, though they are currently generally treated as separate species.

A hybrid with a Lapland longspur was photographed at St. Lewis Inlet, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, during spring migration in April 2011.

==Description==
The snow bunting is a sexually dimorphic, medium-sized passerine bird. It is ground-dwelling, and walks, runs and can hop if needed. It is fairly large and long-winged for a bunting. It measures 15 cm with a wingspan of and weights 30 to 40 grams. The bill is normally yellow with a black tip, however in males, the bill is all black in the summer. The plumage is white underneath and the wings and back have black and white on them. The female and male have different plumage; during the breeding season, the male is white with black wingtips and a black back, while the female has black wingtips and the black feathers on the back fringed with brown. During the winter, they both have broad orangey-brown fringes on the back feathers. In the spring, the buntings do not moult as many other passerines do; instead the breeding colours come with the wearing and abrasion of the brown fringes to show just the black centres of the feathers. Unlike most passerines, it has feathered tarsi, an adaptation to its harsh cold environment. No other passerine can winter as far north as this species, apart from the common raven.

This species is easily confused with McKay&#x27;s bunting due to the similarity of their plumage and the occurrence of hybrids. It can also be confused with the Lapland longspur, which differs mainly in having minimal white in the wing; their calls are similar, but the snow bunting has more &#x27;liquid&#x27; rippling tone, while Lapland longspur has a drier, more rattling tone. Another species that it may occur with is the horned lark, although that has a conspicuous black-and-yellow head pattern, a longer, partly black tail and no white on the wings.

=== Vocalizations ===
The call is a distinctive rippling whistle, &quot;per,r,r,rit&quot;, and the song is a brief but loud warble &quot;hudidi feet feet feew hudidi&quot;.

Snow buntings use vocalizations to communicate among each other and males will have a song to attract the female. The communication calls are done by both the male and the female and they tend to be emitted in flight or in the ground, while the males will often emit the song from a perching position or in a flight display. The males will start singing as soon as they will reach the breeding grounds, and will stop once they find a mate. Studies have shown that the quality and the rate at which a song is emitted affect the reproductive success of a male. The rate of a song measured by the number of strophes per minute is limited by the foraging needs of the male; therefore, a male that is able to sing more frequently shows that he is more successful and effective in his foraging behaviour. The song becomes an indicator of the parental care qualities of the male, since having an effective foraging behaviour will provide a better probability of survival of the nestlings. Females will then choose their mates based on their song rate.
Within snow buntings, vocalizations in males are unique to each individual, although there is certain syllable sharing between one another. The uniqueness of each song reveals a capacity of recognition between individuals and has an effect in the individual fitness and reproductive success. The songs have duration of 2 seconds and have a frequency of 2 to 6 kHz. Each song is composed of similar and dissimilar figures that create different motifs that will alternate and repeat, resulting in a unique pattern for every male individual.

==Distribution and habitat==
The snow bunting lives in very high latitudes in the Arctic tundra. There is no apparent limit to its northern range, while the southern range is limited by the duration of daylight, which influences their reproductive activity. This species is found in the high Arctic tundra of North America, Ellesmere Island, Iceland, higher mountains of Scotland, Norway, Russia, North Greenland, Siberia, Novaya Zemlya, and Franz Josef Land. During the winter, this bird migrates to the circumglobal northern temperate zone including the south of Canada, the northern United States, the coasts and plains of northern Europe in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, and east to central Asia. During the last ice age, the snow bunting was widespread throughout continental Europe.
During the breeding period, the snow bunting looks for rocky habitats in the Arctic. Since the vegetation in the tundra is low growing, this bird and its nestlings are exposed to predators, and in order to ensure the survival of its offspring, the snow bunting nests in cavities in order to protect the nestlings from any threat. During this period, buntings also look for a habitat rich in vegetation such as wet sedge meadows and areas rich in dryas and lichens. In the winter, they seek open habitats such as farms, barren fields, and lakeshores, where they feed on seeds in the ground.

=== Migration ===
The snow buntings migrate to the Arctic to breed and they are the first migrant species that arrives in these territories. The males will arrive first at the beginning of April, when the temperature can reach as low as −30 °C. This early migration could be explained by the fact that this species is highly territorial and the quality of the nesting area is crucial to their reproductive success. Females will arrive four to six weeks later, when the snow starts to melt. They tend to migrate in small flocks and have an undulating flight at a moderate height.

The birds overwinter in northern temperate zones in open fields and forms moving flocks that can number into the hundreds. They will leave the Arctic at the middle and end of September, although some will start the migration at the beginning of November. The female leaves first and tends to winter in more southern territories than the male, while the juveniles will leave the Arctic even later than the adults. Once the snow bunting migrates south, they are able to lose the weight they had gained for breeding.

The migration is nocturnal and the birds are able to detect the geomagnetic field of the Earth in order to guide themselves to their breeding and overwinter territory. The orientation of the snow bunting during migration is independent of any type of visual cue. Furthermore, studies have shown that only those individuals with adequate energy storage will be able to select seasonally appropriate directions during their migration.

=== Physiological adaptations ===
Right before the breeding season, snow buntings undergo significant physiological changes to prepare for their journey to higher Arctic regions. One of the most obvious changes is an increase in body weight. They undergo the process of hyperphagia, or increased food take, which builds up their fat reserves. Their overall fat mass increases by 30%, while their lean mass decreases by 15%. The size of their pectoralis muscle also increases so that they can increase shivering thermogenesis through muscle contractions. As they reach the Arctic, snow buntings must be ready to engage in breeding and courtship. Their fat reserves also provide energy for reproduction during this time. Once the breeding season is over, snow buntings lose most of their extra fat to fly back to the southern regions where they continue to live until next season.

== Behaviour ==
=== Food and feeding ===
From the fall to the spring the snow bunting eats a variety of weeds such as knotweed, ragweed, amaranth, goosefoot, aster, and goldenrod and also eats various types of grass seeds. During this season it will forage in the snow collecting seeds from lower stems. During the summer their diet includes seeds of crowberry, bilberry, bistort, dock, poppy, purple saxifrage and invertebrates such as butterflies, true bugs, flies, wasps and spiders. The nestlings are fed exclusively on invertebrates. Snow buntings also prey on basking spiders by throwing rocks around and less regularly they will try to catch invertebrates in flight.

===Breeding===
Snow buntings have a monogamous behaviour in which the males have a positive impact in the reproductive success of the female, although they are not essential to the survival of the nestling. The male will follow the female during her fertile period to make sure that she will not mate with any other male. The nest sites provide safety but bring other challenges to snow buntings, since in rock cracks and fissures the microclimate could be harsh, the incubation time might be longer for this species and there is a risk that the lower temperatures kill the embryo. To overcome this challenge, the male will bring food to the female during the incubation time, in this way she will be able to constantly control the temperatures of the nest microclimate improving the hatching success and reducing the incubation time.

It lays its eggs as soon as the ambient temperature is above 0 °C The eggs are blue-green, spotted brown, and hatch in 12–13 days, and the young are already ready to fly after a further 12–14 days.

==== Courtship behaviour ====
The courtship behaviour of snow buntings varies in different parts of the world. In Greenland, the male will have a threat display to defend his territory. This display will consist of very loud calls, the male will lower its head down and will turn completely to face the newcomer. The males will also have a ceremonial flight to attract the female, in which they will reach a height of , then they will glide, they will sing the song very loudly and will then keep on singing from a perching position.

== Effects of climate change on snow bunting populations ==
Several indices suggest that climate change could potentially have an important impact on the snow bunting&#x27;s populations. The Arctic oscillation index (AO) is a regional climate index that helps to predict ecological processes. In the Arctic, when the AO index is in a positive phase, there are higher winter temperatures and precipitation, followed by an earlier and warmer spring, and the summer is cloudy and humid with lower temperatures. Usually the AO index tends to oscillate from a positive to a negative phase, but during the last past 40 years, the AO index has remained in the positive phase. Studies have shown that warmer springs trigger an early breeding behaviour in the snow buntings that mismatches the peak of their food sources, leading to a lower success rate of the hatchlings. Even more, the higher temperatures will bring to the Arctic other species that will compete with the snow bunting. It is also thought that higher temperatures might allow greater survival of second broods in the snow bunting species.

<text>A spinal nerve is a mixed nerve, which carries motor, sensory, and autonomic signals between the spinal cord and the body. In the human body there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, one on each side of the vertebral column. These are grouped into the corresponding cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and coccygeal regions of the spine. There are eight pairs of cervical nerves, twelve pairs of thoracic nerves, five pairs of lumbar nerves, five pairs of sacral nerves, and one pair of coccygeal nerves. The spinal nerves are part of the peripheral nervous system.

== Structure ==

Each spinal nerve is a mixed nerve, formed from the combination of nerve root fibers from its dorsal and ventral roots. The dorsal root is the afferent sensory root and carries sensory information to the brain. The ventral root is the efferent motor root and carries motor information from the brain. The spinal nerve emerges from the spinal column through an opening (intervertebral foramen) between adjacent vertebrae. This is true for all spinal nerves except for the first spinal nerve pair (C1), which emerges between the occipital bone and the atlas (the first vertebra). Thus the cervical nerves are numbered by the vertebra below, except spinal nerve C8, which exists below vertebra C7 and above vertebra T1. The thoracic, lumbar, and sacral nerves are then numbered by the vertebra above. In the case of a lumbarized S1 vertebra (also known as L6) or a sacralized L5 vertebra, the nerves are typically still counted to L5 and the next nerve is S1.
Outside the vertebral column, the nerve divides into branches. The dorsal ramus contains nerves that serve the posterior portions of the trunk carrying visceral motor, somatic motor, and somatic sensory information to and from the skin and muscles of the back (epaxial muscles). The ventral ramus contains nerves that serve the remaining anterior parts of the trunk and the upper and lower limbs (hypaxial muscles) carrying visceral motor, somatic motor, and sensory information to and from the ventrolateral body surface, structures in the body wall, and the limbs. The meningeal branches (recurrent meningeal or sinuvertebral nerves) branch from the spinal nerve and re-enter the intervertebral foramen to serve the ligaments, dura, blood vessels, intervertebral discs, facet joints, and periosteum of the vertebrae. The rami communicantes contain autonomic nerves that serve visceral functions carrying visceral motor and sensory information to and from the visceral organs.

Some anterior rami merge with adjacent anterior rami to form a nerve plexus, a network of interconnecting nerves. Nerves emerging from a plexus contain fibers from various spinal nerves, which are now carried together to some target location. The spinal plexuses are the cervical plexus, brachial plexus, lumbar plexus, the sacral plexus and the much smaller coccygeal plexus.

== Regional nerves ==
=== Cervical nerves ===

The cervical nerves are the spinal nerves from the cervical vertebrae in the cervical segment of the spinal cord. Although there are seven cervical vertebrae (C1–C7), there are eight cervical nerves C1–C8. C1–C7 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while C8 emerges below the C7 vertebra. Everywhere else in the spine, the nerve emerges below the vertebra with the same name.

The posterior distribution includes the suboccipital nerve (C1), the greater occipital nerve (C2) and the third occipital nerve (C3). The anterior distribution includes the cervical plexus (C1–C4) and brachial plexus (C5–T1).

The cervical nerves innervate the sternohyoid, sternothyroid and omohyoid muscles.

A loop of nerves called ansa cervicalis is part of the cervical plexus.

=== Thoracic nerves ===

The thoracic nerves are the twelve spinal nerves emerging from the thoracic vertebrae. Each thoracic nerve T1–T12 originates from below each corresponding thoracic vertebra. Branches also exit the spine and go directly to the paravertebral ganglia of the autonomic nervous system where they are involved in the functions of organs and glands in the head, neck, thorax and abdomen.

==== Anterior divisions ====
The intercostal nerves come from thoracic nerves T1–T11, and run between the ribs. At T2 and T3, further branches form the intercostobrachial nerve. The subcostal nerve comes from nerve T12, and runs below the twelfth rib.

====Posterior divisions====
The medial branches (ramus medialis) of the posterior branches of the upper six thoracic nerves run between the semispinalis dorsi and multifidus, which they supply; they then pierce the rhomboid and trapezius muscles, and reach the skin by the sides of the spinous processes. This sensitive branch is called the medial cutaneous ramus.

The medial branches of the lower six are distributed chiefly to the multifidus and longissimus dorsi, occasionally they give off filaments to the skin near the middle line. This sensitive branch is called the posterior cutaneous ramus.

=== Lumbar nerves ===

The lumbar nerves are the five spinal nerves emerging from the lumbar vertebrae. They are divided into posterior and anterior divisions.

====Posterior divisions====
The medial branches of the posterior divisions of the lumbar nerves run close to the articular processes of the vertebrae and end in the multifidus muscle.

The laterals supply the erector spinae muscles.

The upper three give off cutaneous nerves which pierce the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi at the lateral border of the erector spinae muscles, and descend across the posterior part of the iliac crest to the skin of the buttock, some of their twigs running as far as the level of the greater trochanter.

==== Anterior divisions ====
The anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves (rami anteriores) increase in size from above downward. They are joined, near their origins, by gray rami communicantes from the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic trunk. These rami consist of long, slender branches which accompany the lumbar arteries around the sides of the vertebral bodies, beneath the psoas major. Their arrangement is somewhat irregular: one ganglion may give rami to two lumbar nerves, or one lumbar nerve may receive rami from two ganglia.

The first and second, and sometimes the third and fourth lumbar nerves are each connected with the lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk by a white ramus communicans.

The nerves pass obliquely outward behind the psoas major, or between its fasciculi, distributing filaments to it and the quadratus lumborum.

The first three and the greater part of the fourth are connected together in this situation by anastomotic loops, and form the lumbar plexus.

The smaller part of the fourth joins with the fifth to form the lumbosacral trunk, which assists in the formation of the sacral plexus. The fourth nerve is named the furcal nerve, from the fact that it is subdivided between the two plexuses.

=== Sacral nerves ===
The sacral nerves are the five pairs of spinal nerves which exit the sacrum at the lower end of the vertebral column. The roots of these nerves begin inside the vertebral column at the level of the L1 vertebra, where the cauda equina begins, and then descend into the sacrum.

There are five paired sacral nerves, half of them arising through the sacrum on the left side and the other half on the right side. Each nerve emerges in two divisions: one division through the anterior sacral foramina and the other division through the posterior sacral foramina.

The nerves divide into branches and the branches from different nerves join with one another, some of them also joining with lumbar or coccygeal nerve branches. These anastomoses of nerves form the sacral plexus and the lumbosacral plexus. The branches of these plexus give rise to nerves that supply much of the hip, thigh, leg and foot.

The sacral nerves have both afferent and efferent fibers, thus they are responsible for part of the sensory perception and the movements of the lower extremities of the human body. From the S2, S3 and S4 arise the pudendal nerve and parasympathetic fibers whose electrical potential supply the descending colon and rectum, urinary bladder and genital organs. These pathways have both afferent and efferent fibers and, this way, they are responsible for conduction of sensory information from these pelvic organs to the central nervous system (CNS) and motor impulses from the CNS to the pelvis that control the movements of these pelvic organs.

=== Coccygeal nerves ===

The bilateral coccygeal nerves, Co, are the 31st pair of spinal nerves. It arises from the conus medullaris, and its ventral ramus helps form the coccygeal plexus. It does not divide into a medial and lateral branch. Its fibers are distributed to the skin superficial and posterior to the coccyx bone via the anococcygeal nerve of the coccygeal nerve plexus.

== Function ==

==Spinal plexuses==

A spinal plexus is a weblike nerve plexus formed by the anterior nerve roots that branch and merge repeatedly. The only region that does not have a plexus is the thoracic region. The small cervical plexus is in the neck, the brachial plexus is in the shoulder, the lumbar plexus is in the lower back, beneath this is the sacral plexus, and next to the lower sacrum and coccyx is the very small coccygeal plexus.

== Clinical significance ==

The muscles that one particular spinal root supplies are that nerve&#x27;s myotome, and the dermatomes are the areas of sensory innervation on the skin for each spinal nerve. Lesions of one or more nerve roots result in typical patterns of neurologic defects (muscle weakness, abnormal sensation, changes in reflexes) that allow localization of the responsible lesion.

There are several procedures used in sacral nerve stimulation for the treatment of various related disorders.

Sciatica is generally caused by the compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself

<text>Tainui is a tribal waka confederation of New Zealand Māori iwi. The Tainui confederation comprises four principal related Māori iwi of the central North Island of New Zealand: Hauraki, Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Raukawa and Waikato.
There are other Tainui iwi whose tribal areas lay outside the traditional Tainui boundaries – Ngāi Tai in the Auckland area, Ngāti Raukawa ki Te Tonga and Ngāti Toa in the Horowhenua, Kāpiti region, and Ngāti Rārua and Ngāti Koata in the northern South Island.

== History==

===Early history===

The Tainui iwi share a common ancestry from Polynesian migrants who arrived in New Zealand on the &quot;Tainui&quot; waka, which voyaged across the Pacific Ocean from Hawaiki to Aotearoa (North Island) approximately 800 years ago. According to Pei Te Hurinui Jones, a Tainui historian, Tainui first entered the Waikato around the year 1400 bringing with them kumara plants. By the end of the seventeenth century, Tainui had conquered much of the Waikato region following the conclusion of the Siege of Pōhatu-roa.

===Contact with Europeans===
During the late 1840s and early 1850s European missionaries introduced Tainui to modern inventions such as the water mill and gave then instruction in how to raise various European crops: potatoes were particularly widely planted. They set up a trade school in Te Awamutu to educate young Tainui so they became literate and taught the basics of numeracy and farming skills. Two mills were built to grind the wheat into flour – one near Cambridge on a stream leading to the Waikato River, parts of the mill being still visible. Later in the 1850s, six others were built in the general area. Produce was exported as far as Victoria and California.

The relationship was far from one-sided. The Tainui tribe provided food to the European settlers, and &quot;the present European population…would have been literally starved out of the country but for the extraordinary exertions made by the aboriginal inhabitants to supply them with cheap provisions&quot;, as the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; newspaper reported in 1844. A year later, when the less than 4,000 settlers of Auckland were under threat from an attack by Ngāpuhi from the south, Tainui rangatira Te Wherowhero responded to a request to assist with the planned attack, &quot;You must fight me if you come on to Auckland; for these Europeans are under my protection&quot;, referring to Auckland as the &quot;hem of his cloak&quot; and placing it under his personal tapu.

During this time large numbers of new migrants came to Auckland and Te Wherowhero established a house in Māngere so he could oversee trade and get advice from the government. For a brief period until the mid-1850s, Tainui made a good return from selling food to the new settlers but this came to a sudden end when traders realised they could get food – especially flour – much cheaper from New South Wales. Tainui set up a bank at Cambridge to take the deposits of Māori traders; it was burnt down by the people when it was found that chiefs were using the money as their own.

Relationships between Europeans and Tainui soured as Europeans began to outnumber Māori (around 1858, across all of New Zealand), stopping them from being dependent on friendly tribes for food and protection. At the same time as respect for even high-ranking Māori waned, desire for land settled by them grew among Europeans. At the outbreak of the First Taranaki War, &quot;friendly Māori&quot; in Auckland had to be issued with arm badges to protect them from assault.

Tainui people were expelled from the Auckland area in 1863 because of their refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the Crown and hand in their weapons, which the governor thought posed a threat to Auckland and the new settlers as it had done in Taranaki.

===Kīngitanga===

Tainui were the tribe responsible for setting up the Kīngitanga in 1858 – a pan-Māori movement of mainly central North Island iwi who aimed at establishing a separate Māori nation with a Māori king. The key aim was the refusal of the Kingites to sell land to the government. The first Māori king was the Waikato warrior Te Wherowhero, who came from a line of prominent rangatira. Tainui, who had conquered much Taranaki land, sent warriors to help fight the settlers and British soldiers in Taranaki to prevent minor chiefs selling land to the government. Missionaries at Te Awamutu told the Kīngitanga they would be considered rebels by the government after they refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown. Te Awamutu was a missionary settlement built by the missionaries and Māori Christians in July 1839 after they observed Tainui cannibals who had been fighting at Rotorua return with 60 backpacks of human remains and proceed to cook and eat them in the Otawhao pa.

===British invasion of the Waikato===

The growith of the king movement led Governor Thomas Gore Browne to conclude that they would have to be compelled to submit to British rule. After attempting to achieve a peace settlement through &quot;kingmaker&quot; Wiremu Tamihana, in mid-1861 he sent an ultimatum to the movement&#x27;s leaders. When it was rejected he began drawing up plans to invade the Waikato and depose the king. After a pause, these plans were continued by his successor Governor George Grey, who used troops from the newly formed Commissariat Transport Corps to start construction work on the so-called Great South Road from Drury to the Kingite border at the Mangatāwhiri Stream near Pōkeno.

Events in early 1863 brought tensions to a head. In March Kingites obstructed the construction of a police station at Te Kohekohe, near Meremere. Rewi Maniapoto, accompanied by Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke, led a raid on the property at Te Awamutu occupied by magistrate and Commissioner John Gorst. The raiders sent a message to Gorst—who was absent at the time—to quit the property or risk death; Grey recalled Gorst to Auckland soon after. On 4 June, British troops attacked Tainui Māori at Tataraimaka.

On 9 July 1863 Grey issued a new ultimatum, ordering that all Māori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the river. British forces under Duncan Cameron crossed the Mangatāwhiri Stream and invaded the Waikato on 12 July 1863. The kingitangi forces were defeated at the Battle of Rangiriri on 20–21 November 1863 and on 8 December the Kingite capital at Ngāruawāhia was abandoned to Cameron&#x27;s troops. A new defensive line was built to the south, centered on Paterangi, the largest system of Māori fortifications built during the New Zealand Wars, which was designed to block the main approaches to the agriculturally rich Rangiaowhia district, east of Te Awamutu. On 20 February 1864, Cameron by-passed the fortress and attacked Te Awamutu directly, where he massacred civilians. The kingite forces withdrew; Wiremu Tamihana went east to Maungatautari to block a British advance up the Waikato River into Ngati Raukawa territory. Rewi Maniapoto moved south into the Hangitiki Valley to defend Ngati Maniapoto bases. He was encircled at Ōrākau on 30 March 1864 and forced to withdraw to the south on 1 April.

After their defeat at the hands of the British and kūpapa Māori, who fought alongside the troops, King Tāwhiao and his people were forced to retreat into the heartland of Ngāti Maniapoto, establishing a quasi-autonomous community based around the Kīngitanga, known as the King Country, south of a border known as the &quot;aukati&quot; (&#x27;boundary&#x27;). Under the New Zealand Settlements Act, which had been passed in December 1863, Governor Grey confiscated more than 480,000 hectares of land from the Tainui &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe) in the Waikato as punishment for their &quot;rebellion&quot;. The war and confiscation of land caused heavy economic, social and cultural damage to Waikato-Tainui. The Maniapoto, by contrast, had been more zealous for war than the Waikato, yet suffered no loss of land because its territory was too remote to be of use to white settlers. Some Tainui, such as Wiremu Te Wheoro of Ngati Naho, who was a magistrate for the Pokeno area and later became a Māori MP, fought with the British during the invasion.

===Living in the King Country===
They established their own press, police force, laws and governing body. Europeans who entered the Kīngitanga area were killed. However, because the country was unproductive and the people cut themselves off from European civilization they struggled to develop the Kīngitanga ideal. A number of Pākehā had lived with Ngāti Maniapoto since 1842 such as the French trader Louis Hetet. All of them married Māori women. Drunkenness became a problem among the Kingitanga supporters south of the Puniu, particularly after the arrival of Te Kooti, who had a long established drinking problem from his youth. Friction broke out between the Maniapoto hosts who wanted to engage with the European settlers and the conservative Kīngitanga adherents who wanted to retain power and remain isolated.

===Peace===
Over time the more forward thinking ideas of Maniapoto prevailed, land was sold to the government and work was given to Tainui men on roads and on the main trunk line railway. Māori men were given the vote and Māori were given four Members in Parliament who all argued strongly for modernisation and acceptance of the benefits of Pākehā civilization. Following this schools, stores and churches were built. Some of the Tainui leaders were employed by the government as advisors or given government pensions in recognition of their change of heart and willingness to engage with the government. Tainui continued to work behind the scenes to recover the remainder of the land they believed was wrongly confiscated ( was returned by 1873) from them after their defeat during the land wars. Some land or reserves were given back to Tainui but this act caused intra-tribal friction for many years because most of the land retained by the government was in the north and central Waikato. None of the Maniapoto land was confiscated, despite the fact they were the most actively hostile iwi in Taranaki and during the Waikato campaign, and this annoyed the other Tainui iwi.

===Return of confiscated land and compensation===
 of land was returned to the rebels a few months after the British victory. In 1926 a government commission agreed to pay an annual payment of £3000. Te Puea, the main force in Tainui leadership, indicated to the government that the tribe was prepared to accept money in compensation for the confiscated land. In April 1946 an additional payment of £5000 (later $15,000) per annum was made in perpetuity – this was considered a full and final payment by the Crown, but although accepted by the Kingitanga royalty some members remained discontented as they wanted land. This was a deal worked out directly between Tainui leadership and the Prime Minister Fraser after a hui at Turangawaewae. The deal was accepted by Roore Edwards speaking for Te Puea. Tainui have been actively seeking a resolution to their ongoing grievance over the 1863 confiscation of lands, water rights, and harbour rights. Tribal members were annoyed that the leadership appeared to be frittering away the large annual income on expensive hui. Most of the funds were spent on administration costs, grants to marae for functions such as tangi and entertaining visitors. In 1995 as part of the Treaty of Waitangi settlement the tribe received a second lot of compensation amounting to $195 million, made up of cash and parcels of land in and around Hamilton such as the former air force base at Te Rapa, now called The Base. The compensation is a little over 1 percent of the value of the lands taken as a result of the 1863 invasion.

==Tainui business==
At first many of the investments made were poor such as a fisheries deal, the purchase of the Auckland Warriors rugby league team and a hotel in Singapore, which all failed. A financial overhaul and the separation of the Kīngitanga from Tainui business enterprise has paid dividends. The construction of The Base shopping complex has been a winner for the iwi, drawing many retail customers from the Hamilton central business district. Tainui business supports the Kīngitanga financially, as well as fostering tertiary education for tribal members with grants. Tainui has very close links with Waikato University and each year the university closes down during major Tainui celebrations. From 2002 until 2008 Tainui was also the name of a Māori electorate in Parliament. It was replaced by the Hauraki-Waikato electorate.

In 2009 it was announced that Tainui Group Holdings was to develop farm land adjacent to the Ruakura Research Station and University of Waikato and plan to establish an inland hub for the redistribution and repackaging of containerized products complementing the ports of Auckland and Tauranga. Ruakura will be centered around the existing and planned infrastructure being the East Coast Main Trunk railway line and the proposed Waikato Expressway. Ruakura is intended to support more freight by rail versus road, thus reducing emissions and congestion around the ports of Auckland and Tauranga. Tainui have said that this may provide up to 12,000 jobs and will be a 30–50 year project. The project will include a 195ha Logistics precinct, 262ha Light Industrial precinct, 108ha Innovation precinct, 3 retail areas, 1,800 mixed density houses and over 60ha of public open space for walk and cycle ways, ecological and storm water functions.

The project has been approved by an independent Board of Inquiry, which will enable development to start in 2015 which will provide much needed employment and amenities to the eastern side of Hamilton.

In 2008 Tainui started work on developing a luxury $10 million resort at Lake Taupō. The business failed with the onset of the recession and the assets were valued by Jones, Lang, Lasalle registered valuers, at about $3 million. The failure of this venture under the direction of Mike Pohio Tainui Holdings CEO has raised questions about the ability of the iwi to develop the $3 billion inland port. Few details of the Taupō disaster have been made public. The Waikato Times in September 2014 reported internal friction in the tribe between those who see the Port development as risky and those favouring a higher risk model. After the failure of the Taupō venture the tribe is uneasy about risking its asset base on such a huge venture. In November 2014 a new marae based management structure was voted in designed to rein in risky development.

<text>This is an alphabetical list of common English-language idioms based on baseball, excluding the extended metaphor referring to sex, and including illustrative examples for each entry. Particularly American English has been enriched by expressions derived from the game of baseball.

&quot;See also the [[Glossary of baseball terms]] for the jargon of the game itself, as used by participants, fans, reporters, announcers, and analysts of the game.&quot;
==B==

=== ballpark ===
Ballpark, in the ballpark, ballpark figure, and out of the ballpark — &quot;Ballpark&quot; has been used to mean a broad area of approximation or similarity, or a range within which comparison is possible; this usage the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates to 1960. Another meaning, &quot;sphere of activity or influence&quot;, is cited in 1963. &quot;In the (right) ballpark&quot;, meaning &quot;within reasonable bounds&quot; dates to 1968. A &quot;ballpark figure&quot; or &quot;ballpark estimate&quot;, one that is reasonably accurate, dates to at least 1957. The meaning of &quot;out of the ball park&quot; is to hit a home run; its non-baseball equivalent is to do something well or exactly as it should be done.
&quot;&#x27;They said Itanium would never be their fastest 32-bit processor, but it would be in the ballpark. The original x86 hardware execution mechanism was not in the ballpark. It was barely in the parking lot around the ballpark,&#x27; Brookwood said.&#x27; – Nathan Brookwood, quoted by Stephen Shankland&quot;, CNET&quot;, 23 April 2003.
&quot;Patrick Wiles, a vice president of First Pioneer Farm Credit in Riverhead, said the &#x27;ballpark figure&#x27; for prime vineyard land on the North Fork is $50,000 to $60,000 an acre, &#x27;assuming the development rights have been sold.&#x27;&quot; – Howard G. Goldberg, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 18 July 2004.
MSNBC said Hillary knocked it &quot;out of the park&quot;. – Randy Stelly and Carol Forsloff, &quot;New America Media&quot;, 27 August 2008.

===batting 1000===
Also batting a thousand. Getting everything in a series of items right. In baseball, someone with a batting average of one thousand (written as 1.000) has had a hit for every at bat in the relevant time period (e.g., in a game). &quot;AHDI&quot; dates its non-baseball usage to the 1920s. May also be used sarcastically when someone is getting everything wrong.
&quot;&#x27;But Boston Scientific also needs to hope that a rare event does not become magnified,&#x27; he said. &#x27;It has to be pretty much batting a thousand for a time,&#x27; he said&quot;. — Reed Abelson, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 27 July 2004. 

=== beanball, or throw a beanball ===
To attack an opponent by aiming at their head. In baseball, a beanball is a pitch intentionally thrown at a batter&#x27;s head. In politics, it can be a verbal assault or a policy that is targeted to seriously hurt a particular opponent or group.
headline: &quot;Senator Jim Bunning Throws Beanball at America&#x27;s Unemployed&quot; – Mason Lerner, &quot;The Faster Times,&quot; 26 February 2010.
:::[Note: Then-Sen. Bunning had an established career as a Major League Baseball pitcher prior to running for public office.]
&quot;But Brown and Whitman didn&#x27;t swing at the questions, instead choosing to stick to a game of political beanball — trading jabs on Whitman&#x27;s housekeeper, a Brown aide&#x27;s &quot;whore&quot; remark and even verbal miscues. – Steven Luo, &quot;California Beat,&quot; 13 October 2010.

===big hitter(s)===
At the highest level; used as a noun (&quot;He is a big hitter&quot;).

===big league(s)===
At the highest level; used as a noun (&quot;You&#x27;re in the big leagues now&quot;) or an adjective (&quot;big-league lawyer&quot;). &quot;OED&quot; cites &quot;big league&quot; as specifically American Major League Baseball, and cites its first use in 1899; the non-baseball use appears in 1947. Synonym: major league. Contrast bush league, below.
&quot;For a listener who last heard the New Haven Symphony in the mid-60&#x27;s, in a game but scrappy performance of Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem,&quot; its concert on Friday evening was a happy surprise. Under its music director, Michael Palmer, it sounded for the most part like a big-league band, at home in a big-league setting&quot;. — James Oestreich, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 25 January 1994.

===brand new ballgame===
In baseball, when a team that has been behind in runs ties up the game, it is sometimes said to be a brand new ballgame. This does not mean that the game starts over from the first inning; it only means that neither team is ahead, and the game continues. In other realms, the term is used to connote a change in tactics or who is ahead in a competition.
&quot;It&#x27;s a Brand New Ballgame for Outsourcing Real Estate&quot; — John C. Maher, &quot;National Real Estate Investor&quot;, 1 July 2005.
&quot;Brand new ball game: New peanut program brings change&quot; — Paul L. Hollis, &quot;Southwest Farm Press,&quot; 21 March 2002.

=== brush back ===
To subvert or threaten verbally. In baseball, a brushback pitch is any pitch intended to establish a pitcher&#x27;s command of the inside portion of the strike zone, usually involving throwing a pitch at or near a hitter who may be covering that portion of the strike zone. Its baseball usage is cited in many dictionaries, but its transition to the vernacular has yet to be dated.
&quot;&quot;The Washington Times&#x27; &quot; George Archibald reports that Gerald A. Reynolds, assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education, has sent a long overdue brush-back letter to college and university officials concerning their odious and oppressive campus speech codes&quot;. — David Limbaugh,&quot;The Washington Times,&quot; August 19, 2003.
&quot;One spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, has been throwing brushback pitches at reporters who write about Romney&#x27;s faith, asking if they would write similar stories about Jews&quot;. – Jeffrey Goldberg, &quot;Bloomberg News,&quot; June 18, 2012.

=== bush league ===
Amateur, unsophisticated, unprofessional. From the baseball term &quot;bush league&quot; for a second-rate baseball league and therefore its players (as in &quot;bush-league pitcher&quot; etc.). &quot;OED&quot; cites its first baseball use as 1906 (although there are uses as early as 1896), non-baseball in 1914. Contrast big league, above.
&quot;Kinsley, who does come off as the stereotypical Los Angeles-hating East Coast wonk, said recently that because L.A. is the second biggest city in the country, &#x27;it&#x27;s really bush league to care about where the writers are from.&#x27;&quot;— Catherine Seipp, &quot;National Review&quot;, March 24, 2005.

==C==

=== Charley horse ===
Sudden stiffness or a cramp in the leg. The etymology of &quot;charley horse&quot; is unknown; &quot;CDS&quot; cites its first use c. 1887 as baseball slang; &quot;OED&quot; states such cramps occur &quot;especially in baseball players&quot; and cites this usage to 1888.
&quot;Tried on more than 1,400 patients for almost two years, it has proved effective for many kinds of pain in the muscles and around joints — charley horse, tennis elbow, stiff neck, torticollis (&#x27;wryneck&#x27;), whiplash injury, muscular rheumatism, and muscle pain resulting from slipped disks&quot;. — &quot;Time&quot;, 8 June 1959

=== cleanup hitter ===
Someone who comes in to solve a problem or lead a team. In baseball a cleanup hitter is the fourth man in the batting order, typically a slugger who is expected to clear the bases by driving other runners home to score runs. The &quot;OED&quot; first attributes &quot;cleanup hitter&quot; or &quot;cleanup man&quot; in its modern baseball usage to 1922.
Under the headline &quot;Merrill&#x27;s cleanup hitter: new position focuses on quality of research,&quot; it is stated that &quot;at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., the &quot;buy,&quot; &quot;sell&quot; and &quot;hold&quot; buck stops with William J. Genco&quot;.
Under the headline &quot;Trimeris Gets a Cleanup Hitter,&quot; it is stated that &quot;Yesterday, tiny drug developer Trimeris (Nasdaq: TRMS) announced that it finally found a permanent CEO to help get itself in order following the resignation of its former leader a year ago.
Referring to President George W. Bush: &quot;There is a reason he is the current president and it is not just because of his Daddy or money — I think he makes a pretty solid cleanup hitter for the Republican Party and brought home the points made during the previous 4 days of the convention&quot;.

=== closer ===
In baseball, a &quot;closing pitcher&quot; or &quot;closer&quot; is brought in to finish the game. In business, the person brought in to close the deal, get things done.

===cover one&#x27;s bases===
Also cover all the bases. To ensure safety; to take all relevant details, problems, or exigencies into account, even unlikely ones. In baseball, a defensive player covers a base by standing close to it, ensuring a runner cannot reach it safely. In business, covering one&#x27;s bases means being prepared for every contingency. Mentioned but not dated by Oxford University Press.
&quot;Arson investigators sifted through the rubble of an Airdrie Stud barn today, but failed to determine the cause of a fire that killed 15 thoroughbred broodmares and yearlings Saturday night. The horses were worth more than $1 million, according to Brereton Jones, owner of the stud farm. &#x27;We do not have any reason to believe it was arson, but you just want to be sure you cover all the bases,&#x27; he said&quot;. — Associated Press, in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; 7 January 1985.&quot;Cisco&#x27;s FastHub 400 series has the bases covered&quot;.

=== curveball, curve ===
As in &quot;He really threw me a curveball&quot;. A surprise, often completely and totally unexpected, and usually unpleasant. The curveball is a pitch in baseball designed to fool the batter by curving unexpectedly. &quot;AHDI&quot; dates this usage to the mid-20th century.
&quot;Because of my personal story, I&#x27;m very interested in illness. One thing we discovered as a family is that when you&#x27;re thrown a curveball like cancer or multiple sclerosis, often people do not know what to do first&quot;. – Meredith Vieira, quoted by Jeff Chu, &quot;Time&quot;, 27 August 2006.
&quot;Desormeaux chalked up the latest loss, his second so close to the Triple Crown, to another twist in a life so full of them. &#x27;Life throws curves,&#x27; he said, &#x27;Some of us hit it, and some of us will sulk around. We&#x27;ve continued to hit the curveball&#x27;&quot;. – &quot;The New York Times,&quot; 8 June 2008.

==D==

=== doubleheader ===
A &quot;doubleheader&quot; is two contests (or similar events) held on the same day with the same participants.
&quot;The city&#x27;s three mayoral candidates finished Wednesday&#x27;s political double header with a debate at First Congregational United Church for Christ. ...The evening debate did not differ greatly from the luncheon forum that local Rotarians and Kiwanians hosted earlier in the day&quot; — Andrew Edwards, &quot;Contra Costa Times,&quot; 21 October 2009

===down to the last out===
To be near the end of a competition and have just one last chance to succeed. Also sometimes expressed as &quot;down to the last strike.&quot;
&quot;Hillary Clinton is now down to her last out&quot;.

=== ducks on the pond ===
In baseball, &quot;ducks on the pond&quot; occurs when having runners in scoring position, ready for a batter to drive them home. In business, &quot;a situation with a good chance to succeed&quot;.

==E==

===extra innings===
To extend the original time allotted in order to break a tie or settle an issue. In baseball, this means going beyond the standard nine-inning length of a game.

===first base===
In baseball, a batter hopes to reach first base and then continue around second and third bases before reaching home and scoring a run. In interpersonal relations, an individual who cannot get to first base with another person is unable to achieve some initial goal or to establish a relationship. A kiss might be first base in a romantic relationship. (See Baseball metaphors for sex.) Getting an appointment with a potential customer might be first base in a business transaction or negotiation.
Under the headline, &quot;Getting Past First Base,&quot; a writer asks: &quot;How do you turn an initial contact with a prospect into a fully-fledged business relationship? It&#x27;s the essence of sales – but it&#x27;s an area where many people really struggle&quot;. — Ian Brodie, 8 November 2008.

===first inning or early innings===
The early stages of a competition. A game of baseball typically lasts nine innings, so the first inning or the early innings (the first three innings) often do not determine the outcome. Also see &quot;Ninth inning&quot; (below).

===foot in the bucket===
To act in a timid or cowardly fashion. A batter who steps away from home plate with his leading foot (usually in fear of being struck by a pitched ball) instead of a straight-ahead stride is said to &quot;step in the bucket&quot;.
&quot;Even if you haven&#x27;t stepped in the bucket yet, you may one day. So here are Be Better Guys&#x27; Tips for Handling a Screw Up at Work&quot; – &quot;Be Better Guys: A Guy&#x27;s Guide to Getting a Life&quot;, 17 June 2009.

===four-bagger===
A complete success; compare home run, below. In baseball, &quot;four-bagger&quot; is another term for a home run, since the batter who hits a home run touches all four bags or bases, including home plate. A &quot;four-bagger&quot; in baseball may also mean any combination of hits and errors in one at-bat where the batter touches all four bases (a triple and an error, for example, a double and a two-base error, a single and a three-base error, or four-base error).
Referring to the prospects of a high-tech company, a headline reads, &quot;Is Netflix a Four-Bagger in the Making&quot;?

==G==

===grand slam===
Any sudden, sweeping victory. A batter who hits a home run with bases loaded has hit a four-run &quot;grand slam,&quot; a term originally borrowed from contract bridge for winning thirteen tricks. Aside from baseball, the term now refers to a situation which may or may not end badly for the protagonist but from which they emerge as an obvious winner. The term also can refer to anything good which comes in four parts, such as a &quot;grand slam breakfast.&quot;

===grandstanding===
In baseball, a player who shows off or showboats to win the favor of the fans (in the grandstand) is said to be grandstanding. In other contexts, including politics, playing to the crowd, the audience, or the media might be described as grandstanding.
&quot;Tellem weighed in with a thoughtful back-page article in this Sunday&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; regarding the recent Congressional and mainstream media grandstanding over steroids&quot;. — Jay Jaffe, &quot;Futility Infielder,&quot; 5 April 2005.

&quot;Opinions were varied and passionate, but there was no sniping, no partisan grandstanding.&quot; — Alex Williams, &quot;The New York Times,&quot; June 22, 2012.

===ground ball===
A prosaic or ordinary accomplishment, beneath higher hopes or expectations. In baseball, a ground ball is a batted ball that bounces or rolls on the ground, perhaps for a base hit, perhaps for an out.
&quot;Sony once hit home runs, but now it&#x27;s lost its touch,&quot; said Akihiko Jojima, an analyst and author of the book &quot;Sony&#x27;s Sickness&quot;. &quot;Sony still makes competent products but they&#x27;re all just boring ground balls.&quot; — Hiroko Tabuchi, &quot;New York Times,&quot; 28 March 2010.

==H==

===hardball, play hardball===
To be or act tough or aggressive. Refers to the comparison between balls in baseball and softball. As a synonym for baseball, &quot;OED&quot; dates this use of &quot;hardball&quot; to 1883; its non-baseball use appears in 1973.
&quot;Hauser would like to extend its three-year contract with Bristol-Myers, becoming a supplier of the material for semi-synthetic Taxol. &#x27;I think this is just tough bargaining,&#x27; said Deborah Wardwell of Dain Bosworth Securities. &#x27;It seems to suggest hardball tactics.&#x27;&quot; — Milt Freudenheim, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 10 January 2007.

===heavy hitter===
A powerful or commanding person, a leader. In baseball a heavy hitter is a slugger, someone who hits a lot of extra-base hits or home runs. In business, the heavy hitters may be those who draw the most clients or make the most sales, or who lead the organization. In politics a heavy hitter draws crowds or has a lot of power or influence.

headline: &quot;UW Adds Heavy Hitters from High Tech and Biotech to Turn More Ideas Into Companies&quot;.

===hit it out of the park===
Also knock it out of the park. To achieve complete or even a spectacular success; compare home run, below. A home run is automatically scored when a batter strikes the ball with such force as to hit it out of the stadium or playing field.
&quot;11:55 AM: Kerry stumbled over the question of whether God is on America&#x27;s side. But Edwards hit it out of the park with his anecdote about Abraham Lincoln saying America is on God&#x27;s side. He is the more nimble debater and conversationalist&quot;. — Katherine Q. Seelye, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 29 February 2004.

===hit or miss===
To either achieve success or completely fail. In baseball, when a batter swings their bat at a pitched ball, they may either hit the ball or miss it.

===home run===
A complete success (opposite of strike out); often used in the verb phrase &quot;hit a home run&quot;. &quot;OED&quot; cites this usage to 1965.

&quot;HGTV caught on quickly, and is now carried in 90 million homes. The Food Network has been a home run as well, luring viewers interested in cooking&quot;. — Geraldine Fabrikant, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 14 August 2006.

==I==

===inside baseball===

Within the sport, &quot;inside baseball&quot; refers to the stratagems that managers use to get their team to score runs, perhaps not as obvious as simply getting players to hit home runs or to catch the ball, but to do the little things that move runners towards home plate. Akin to the idea of small ball. Outside the game, &quot;inside baseball&quot; may refer to the behind-the-scenes machinations of politicians, bankers, or other professionals.
under the headline &quot;Dana Milbank&#x27;s Inside Baseball,&quot; a news story begins: &quot;With a few deft strokes and in fewer than 25 inches, Dana Milbank draws behind-the-scenes portraits of Washington power with such dexterity and hilarity that his Washington Sketch column is a must-read for anyone who wants to know how politics in this city really works&quot;. – Brigid Schulte, The Washington Post, 2 March 2010.
&quot;I once had to hire a writer to create my firm&#x27;s brochure, because what I did was far too &quot;inside baseball.&quot; Meaning, too focused on the details only an insider could love and not enough on what the audience wanted to know&quot;.

===&quot;It ain&#x27;t over till it&#x27;s over!&quot;===
A famous quotation from baseball player and manager Yogi Berra; one of many yogiisms. Berra used it in 1973, while managing the New York Mets, to mean a team is not out of the pennant race until they are mathematically eliminated. In sports, it is usually used to mean that a game is not officially over until time expires or the final out is registered, and that the players need to stay mentally focused until that point, particularly when their team has a large lead but there is sufficient time for the opposing team to come back and win. The original and self-evident adage, misstated by Berra, is &quot;The game is not over until the last man is out.&quot; In non-sports contexts, the quotation means that one should not assume a dangerous or disadvantageous situation has ended or passed until this has been confirmed by other events. 
&quot;In spite of last winter&#x27;s nice snowpack and a wet summer, here&#x27;s the bad news about New Mexico&#x27;s drought: It ain&#x27;t over till it&#x27;s over, and it ain&#x27;t over&quot;. — Staci Matlock, &quot;The New Mexican&quot;, 9 October 2005.

===&quot;It&#x27;s like déjà vu all over again!&quot;===
Another famous (attributed) yogiism; a redundant way of saying &quot;Here we go again!&quot; It has come into general usage to describe any situation that seems to be observably repeating itself.
&quot;Kay told CNN he is worried because he&#x27;s hearing some of the same signals about Iran and its nuclear program that were heard as the Bush administration made its case for the war in Iraq. &#x27;It&#x27;s déjà vu all over again,&#x27; Kay said&quot;. — David Kay, former U.S. chief weapons inspector (quote).

==K==

===knock it out of the park===
See hit it out of the park.

===knock the cover off the ball===
To succeed beyond expectation. Derived from the act of hitting the ball exceptionally hard, so as to make the leather covering come off. Tearing the cover off the ball was possible in the early days of baseball, since a single ball was often used for the entire game (as is the case in the game of cricket). The phrase was used in a newspaper account of a baseball game as early as 1866.
&quot;In the last two quarters, we knocked the cover off the ball. . . . We exceeded analysts&#x27; expectations on Wall Street and our own guidance in both quarters&quot;.

==L==

===late innings===
See &quot;ninth inning&quot;.

===leadoff hitter===
In baseball, a leadoff hitter is the player who bats first in the lineup. It can also refer to any batter who bats first in an inning. In other fields of endeavor, the leadoff hitter is the one who goes first in a series.
headline: &quot;The American Patriot Program announces August leadoff hitters for its national campaign&quot;.
&quot;The decision to place Ms. Obama centre stage in Denver is something of a gamble; rarely have the spouses of presidential candidates played leadoff hitter in such a high-stakes political exercise&quot;.

===left field===
As in &quot;come out of left field&quot;. Unusual, unexpected, or irrational. In baseball, the fielders are focused on home plate, which is the place from which they expect balls to be hit to them. If a ball (e.g., one that was previously hit into the stands) or some other object is thrown at the fielder or onto the field from the outfield seats behind them, it is unexpected and surprising. This may be the origin of the expression &quot;out of left field.&quot; First used in the idiomatic sense in the early 20th century by song pluggers working in the American music industry to indicate an unexpectedly successful song.
&quot;Depp&#x27;s performance came out of left field in &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;; nobody had ever thought of channeling Keith Richards and Pepé Le Pew before&quot;. — Kent Williams, &quot;Isthmus: The Daily Page&quot;.

==M==

===major league===
At the highest level. Synonym: big league.
&quot;When you&#x27;ve landed a tenure-track position at that university, you&#x27;re playing in the major leagues.&quot;

===Mendoza line===
A line marking a very poor performance or the threshold for barely competent performance, referring to the Mendoza line of a .200 batting average in baseball.
&quot;Over the last five years, Wall Street analysts have only been right once. They&#x27;re below the Mendoza line, batting just 200. And they&#x27;re misleading investors again&quot; — Brit Ryle, &quot;Taipan Financial News,&quot; 13 December 2005.

===Murderers&#x27; Row===
A large group of talented individuals or valuable assets. Most notably used to describe the 1927 New York Yankees, who had fearsome hitters throughout their line-up, although it was used to describe other baseball teams as early as 1905.
&quot;He was the unexpected underdog who comes out of nowhere and starts landing one uppercut after another into the chins of a murderer&#x27;s [sic] row of 800-pound gorillas.&quot; — Andrew Leonard, &quot;Salon.com,&quot; 10 March 2008.

==N==

===ninth inning===
An expression that an event or process is near the end – in the last of a nine-inning game. Referring to a trend in market expansion, a financial analyst may say &quot;We&#x27;re in the eighth or ninth inning&quot;. During a seemingly never-ending crisis, an analyst might remark &quot;No Ninth Inning for Credit Crisis&quot;. The president of an academic association may title his farewell column to the members &quot;A Ninth-Inning Farewell&quot;.
&quot;&#x27;We&#x27;re in the late innings for U.S. small-cap stocks,&#x27;&quot; said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.&quot; – &quot;Wall Street Journal,&quot; 31 December 2007.

==O==

===o-fer===
Also oh-fer. If a baseball batter gets 0 hits in any number of at-bats in a game, he&#x27;s said to go &quot;oh for&quot; that number (as in 0-3, said as &quot;Oh for three&quot;), or perhaps even more colloquially, to &quot;have an o-fer&quot;. In business, an example of an &quot;o-fer&quot; would be to try repeatedly and fail to make any sales.
Under the headline &quot;Senate Dems go O-fer,&quot; it is reported: &quot;The Senate just voted on whether to proceed with four budgets: the House 2012 budget, the Toomey budget, the Paul budget, and President Obama&#x27;s 2012 proposal. All were voted down&quot;.

===off base===
Unawares or by surprise, usually in the phrase &quot;caught off base&quot;; &quot;OED&quot; dates to 1935. Can also mean misguided, mistaken, or working on faulty assumptions; this usage dates to 1940. Both of these uses derive from the situation of a runner being away from a base and thus in a position to being put out (1872).
&quot;The absence of any sharp new angle, any strong new drive in Mr. Roosevelt&#x27;s messages reflected the fact that he and his Cabinet (only Messrs. Hull, Murphy, Woodring, Edison and Ickes were at hand) had been caught off-base with the rest of the world by the Hitler-Stalin deal, the sudden push for Poland&quot;. — &quot;Time&quot;, 3 September 1939.
&quot;Lotte Ulbricht replied that Madame Yang was way off base. No one was demanding that oppressed nations live happily with their oppressors, she said, and added that Russia was, as always, &#x27;wholeheartedly behind the revolutionary struggles of colonial peoples.&#x27;&quot; — &quot;Time&quot;, 5 July 1963.

===on deck===
Next in line to face a particular challenge. In baseball, a batter emerges from the dugout and loosens up &quot;on-deck&quot; just before his turn to face the pitcher. &quot;OED&quot; mentions usage of &quot;on deck&quot; first in 1867 in the context of baseball (&quot;on deck fig. [orig. U.S.]: at hand; ready for action; alive; in Baseball, next at the bat, with the right or privilege of batting next&quot;.)
headline: &quot;Barletta, 0-2, back on deck&quot; – Roderick Random, &quot;Scranton Times,&quot; 30 May 2009.lede: &quot;With no one else as formidable, Republicans are pressuring the Hazleton mayor [Barletta] to run against the longtime Democratic congressman next year&quot;. – &quot;Scranton Times&quot;, 30 May 2009.headline: &quot;Loren French is On Deck to Speak to Us at EntConnect 2007!&quot; – &quot;A Better Blogsite,&quot; 1 February 2007

===one base at a time===
In baseball, a manager may adopt a strategy of moving runners along one base at a time rather than emphasizing power hitting and high-scoring innings. In other walks of life, such a step-by-step approach may also be referred to as a &quot;one base at a time&quot; approach.
&quot;Organizations instead need a deep bench of players with varying capabilities and a clear strategy for advancing ideas one base at a time. That&#x27;s what puts runs on the scoreboard and delivers value to members or customers&quot;.
headline: &quot;For RNA polymerase, it&#x27;s one base at a time&quot;.

===out of left field===
See left field.

===out of one&#x27;s league===
Above someone&#x27;s status, talents, or capabilities. In baseball, professional leagues are classified according to their level of play and quality of talent, with Major League Baseball being the highest level of play and the various leagues comprising Minor League Baseball ranked below. If a player is competing in a league above their level of ability, they are said to be &quot;out of their league&quot;. This idiom is particularly applied to dating and romantic relationships, in which a person is attempting to date someone who is more accomplished, better-looking, or wealthier than themselves. &quot;He (or she) is too tall, too attractive, too smart, too funny, too ambitious or just too plain awesome to be interested in you, right? Wrong. I&#x27;ve come to the realization that no one is truly &quot;out of my league,&quot; and here&#x27;s why.&quot;

==P==

===pinch hit===
To act as a substitute or stand-in for someone when in a &quot;pinch&quot;, especially in an emergency. In baseball, sometimes a substitute batter would be brought in, especially at a crucial point in the game. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives the first non-baseball use in 1918, from sports columnist and short-story writer Ring Lardner:
&quot;He had the thing running, with a piece of common binding twine pinch-hitting for the cord.&quot; — Ring Lardner, &quot;My Four Weeks In France&quot;, viii.179 (1918).

===pitch a shutout===
To not allow an opponent any wins. In baseball, a shutout occurs when a pitcher does not allow the opponent any runs.&quot;The Republican Party pitched a shutout in the South in 2000 and 2004&quot;.

===play ball===
To get going, or to start. Before every baseball game, and after a dead ball situation such as a foul ball or a time-out, the umpire traditionally shouts &quot;play ball&quot; in order to (re-)start the game. &quot;AHDI&quot; dates this usage to the late 19th century. An alternative meaning, &quot;to cooperate&quot;, is not explicitly connected to baseball by &quot;ADHI&quot;, but is so derived by the &quot;Cambridge Dictionary of American Idioms&quot;.
&quot;&#x27;Eight U.S. attorneys who did not play ball with the political agenda of this administration were dropped from the team,&#x27; said Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois&quot;.

===play softball===
To ask easy questions. Perhaps the opposite of playing hardball (baseball) or throwing difficult or probing questions at a respondent.

===in a pickle===
To be caught in a tough spot. See rundown.

==R==

===rain-check (rain-cheque) ===
Originally, a ticket given to a spectator at an outdoor event providing for admission at a later date (in lieu of a refund of entrance money), should the event be interrupted by rain.

Figuratively, an assurance of a deferral or extension of an offer, especially an assurance that a customer can take advantage of a deal or sale later because the item or service offered is temporarily not available (as by being sold out); or a (sometimes vague) promise to reissue or accept a social offer at an unnamed later date. The two latter meanings derive from the first, which dates at least to 1877 – see rain check (baseball) – and metaphorical usage dates to at least 1896 – see .
&quot;To deal with frustration among holiday shoppers hunting for its Wii game console, Nintendo Co. and retailer GameStop Corp. are launching a rain check program&quot;. — Tribune wires, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, 19 December 2007.
&quot;Another scheduled member of the party, Pat McKenna, White House doorkeeper for thirty-five years, was prevented from making the trip due to an illness in his immediate family, but the President said at his press conference today that he had given McKenna a rain check on the next cruise.&quot; — &quot;Roosevelt starts for ocean cruise.&quot; &quot;The New York Times,&quot; April 30, 1938.
===rally cap===
In baseball, a rally cap is a baseball cap worn while inside-out and/or backwards or in another unconventional manner by players or fans, in order to will a team into a come-from-behind rally late in the game. The rally cap is primarily a baseball superstition. The term may also be used by other groups, such as stock market traders.
headline: &quot;Muni Market Traders Keep Their Rally Caps On&quot; – Patrick McGee, &quot;The Bond Buyer,&quot; 15 April 2011.

===relief pitcher===
In baseball a relief pitcher comes in as a replacement for the starting pitcher or another relief pitcher. A relief pitcher in other realms of activity also comes in as a substitute or replacement for the initial or regular occupant of a role.
&quot;Vincent B. Orange doesn&#x27;t see himself as an opportunist. Rather, he&#x27;s more of a &#x27;relief pitcher&#x27; with the chops to push the District&#x27;s business goals, he said, after council member Harry Thomas Jr. relinquished control of the Committee on Economic Development while he fights a lawsuit accusing him of taking public funds for personal use&quot;.—&quot;The Washington Times,&quot; 9 June 2011.

===rhubarb===
A heated argument or noisy dispute; especially, between players on a playing field. Originally the word traditionally muttered by actors in a play to provide background noise. Online Etymology Dictionary attributes the &quot;loud squabble on the field&quot; usage to broadcaster Garry Schumacher in 1938, while &quot;OED&quot; and &quot;CDS&quot; both credit sportscaster Red Barber at a baseball game in 1943. &quot;OED&#x27;s&quot; first non-baseball cite is 1949.
&quot;If the theater people won their point, it was not much of a point to win. The entire rhubarb, after all, was about nothing but money&quot;. — &quot;Time&quot;, 7 June 1963.
===right off the bat===
From the very first; immediately; without any delay. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates this term to 1914 in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, a Canadian magazine. An older term, &quot;hot from the bat&quot;, dates to the 1888 play &quot;Meisterschaft&quot; by Mark Twain.
&quot;&#x27;It was very clear right off the bat that the loss of Cdk5 made them have a much stronger associative memory,&#x27; Professor Bibb said&quot;. — Reuters, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 29 May 2007.

==S==

===&quot;Say it ain&#x27;t so, Joe!&quot;===
An expression of disbelief. A reference to the Black Sox scandal, in which several members of the Chicago White Sox conspired with gamblers to lose the 1919 World Series on purpose. According to an apocryphal story, when Shoeless Joe Jackson was implicated in the scandal, a young fan approached him and said, &quot;Say it ain&#x27;t so, Joe!&quot;

===screwball===
Eccentric, zany, or crazy; &quot;OED&quot; dates this usage to 1933. The screwball is a rarely used pitch (because of its effect on the arm) that is intended to behave erratically — it &quot;breaks&quot; in the opposite direction a curveball would break.
&quot;And now, as we enter not only the best season for stocks in the calendar year, but also the very best three quarters in the four-year election cycle, you&#x27;d think you should just sit back and enjoy the ride, right? But I&#x27;m worried the market may be getting ready to throw us a screwball&quot;. – &quot;MarketWatch,&quot; 16 October 2010.

===shutout===
See &quot;pitch a shutout&quot;.

===singles or hit singles===
To seek modest, or step-by-step gains instead of large ones. In baseball, hitting singles or playing small ball instead of seeking to hit home runs is sometimes a good strategy for teams that do not have many power hitters.
&quot;With the duration [of bonds] tailwind on the wane, investors must literally scour the globe for opportunities, seeking coins and jewels rather than treasure chests. In baseball vernacular, investors must now aim to hit singles rather than swinging for the fences&quot;. – Anthony J. Crescenzi, Morningstar.com, 22 December 2010.

===small ball===
In modern baseball play and analysis (sabermetrics), small ball refers to a strategy that focuses on gaining a small or step-by-step edge on the opponent not by trying to knock the ball out of the ballpark but instead by getting singles, stealing bases, and moving runners along one base at a time. In other endeavors, a similar focus on the details, winning a few points at a time rather than trying for large gains, may also be described as small ball.
headline: &quot;The president plays small ball&quot; – Charles Krauthammer, &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; 26 January 2012.

===softball===
See &quot;play softball&quot;.

===spitball===
To propose ideas without prejudice.

===step up to the plate===
Often shortened to step up. To rise to an occasion in life. Refers to when a player must approach home plate to take a turn at batting. &quot;OED&quot; cites baseball usage in 1875, general usage in 1919.
headline: &quot;First Responders Stepped Up to the Plate&quot;.
headline: &quot;Pig Farmers Have Stepped Up to the Plate&quot;.

===strike===
As in &quot;strike out&quot;, &quot;three strikes, you&#x27;re out&quot;, &quot;a strike against you&quot;, &quot;He was born with two strikes against him&quot;. In baseball, a strike occurs when the batter swings at and misses a pitch, or when a pitch crosses the strike zone without the batter swinging. A batter with three strikes is out and must stop batting.

The word &quot;strike&quot; has crept into common English usage to mean a failure, shortcoming, disadvantage, or loss. When a person has &quot;gotten three strikes&quot; or &quot;struck out&quot;, they have failed completely. Three-strikes laws are those which require the imposition of a more severe punishment for a criminal with a third conviction. Someone seeking a job, or romance with another person, may &quot;strike out&quot; and fail to impress on a first meeting. Also a swing and a miss.
Headline: &quot;Everybody Struck Out in Marietta Teen Drinking Incident&quot; – &quot;Atlanta Journal and Constitution,&quot; 25 February 2010.
Having &quot;two strikes against you&quot; means that you have just one remaining chance to succeed at something, or that you are given little chance to succeed, perhaps because you have been prejudged.
&quot;The British bank Barclays has announced its next CEO. But Bob Diamond already seemingly has two strikes against him going in. One thing, he&#x27;s an American. And number two, he&#x27;s head of the company&#x27;s investment banking arm&quot;. – &quot;American Public Media, &quot;Marketplace&quot;,&quot; 7 September 2010.

===strike out swinging===
To fail while giving it your best effort.

===strike out looking===
To fail by being passive, without even making an effort.

===swing and miss===
To try but fail, like swinging a bat and missing the ball. Also see &quot;whiff.&quot;&quot;I&#x27;ve swung and missed a lot in my hunt for vintage Levis&quot;.
Referring to the disappointing purchase of a living-room couch, &quot;Todd: Hey batter, hey batter, sometimes when you&#x27;re looking for the rainbow curve away, you get the heater down the middle. Maybe that&#x27;s why you swung and missed&quot;.
&quot;The 1988-2000 employment projections: how accurate were they? In the late 1980s, we projected future employment in scores of occupations for the 1988-2000 period. That future is now the past. See where we scored a hit, landed in the ballpark, and – now and then – swung and missed.

===swing for the fences===
To try for a substantial gain; to make a big score. In baseball, to swing for the fences is to try to hit a home run, rather than trying to hit singles or play small ball.
&quot;These are opportunities that traders look for every day. That many of them noticed it and swung for the fences all at once is not collusion, it&#x27;s just the sign of a huge softball coming right down the line&quot;.

===switch hitter===
Refers to baseball players who are capable of hitting as a left-handed or right-handed batter (&quot;OED&quot;, 1948). Colloquially, a switch hitter is a bisexual. More broadly, &quot;switch-hitting&quot; can refer to an ability to perform double functions or roles.
An article titled &quot;Hatteras Plans Switch-Hitting Ethernet&quot; discusses a network switch that can operate either on fiber optic or copper wiring.

===take cuts at someone===
In baseball, a batter swinging the bat at a ball is sometimes said to &quot;take cuts&quot; at the ball. A person who &quot;takes cuts&quot; at somebody else may be taking a verbal swing or striking a blow at the person&#x27;s reputation.

headline: &quot;Opponents Sure to Take Cuts at Stadium Votes in Anaheim Political Game&quot;

===three strikes law===
See Strike.

===took the collar===
From the phrase for failing to get any hits, it can be used to indicate failure at something. Referring to the competition between two newspapers, the &quot;Denver Post&quot; and the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;:
&quot;The &quot;News&quot;, you recall, took the collar as the &#x27;failing newspaper&#x27; when the two sought Justice Department approval in 2000 to merge their business operations&quot;.

===touch base(s)===
As in &quot;we will touch base(s) at the meeting&quot;. To make contact with someone, to inform someone of one&#x27;s plans or activities, perhaps in anticipation of an event. In baseball, a player who is touching a base is not in danger of being put out. Another explanation is that a player must briefly touch each of the bases in order after hitting a home run. It may also refer to the fact that after a fly ball has been caught for an out, a runner on base who has taken a lead, or is standing off his base towards the next base, must go back to touch or tag that base (&quot;tag up&quot;) before he can advance to the next one.
&quot;Trevor, it&#x27;s been a while. I&#x27;d like to touch bases with you next week to discuss our quarterly sales targets.&quot;
&quot;We&#x27;ll touch base again before we leave.&quot;

===triple play===
In baseball a triple play is the rare act of making three outs during the same continuous play. The &quot;OED&quot; attributes the original usage of &quot;triple play&quot; to the American game of baseball as early as 1869.
headline: &quot;President Obama&#x27;s Wednesday NYC Triple Play.&quot; – Celeste Katz, &quot;New York Daily News,&quot; 26 April 2011.lede on same story: &quot;Brace yourself, New York City! President Obama is returning tomorrow for his third visit in less than a month, bringing the increasingly familiar swirl of traffic – and buckraking – that surrounds presidential campaigns&quot;.headline: &quot;Cosmic Triple-Play: Asteroid Flyby, Fireball over Utah, Meteor Shower&quot; – Charles Q. Choi, &quot;SPACE.com,&quot; 18 November 2009.

===wheelhouse===
From the term for a batter&#x27;s power zone, usually waist high and over the middle of the plate. Etymology attributed to Peter Tamony who suggested that batters &quot;wheel&quot; at the ball and &quot;take good, level &#x27;roundhouse&#x27; swings.&quot;
&quot;Carville also said he had not spoken with Hillary Clinton about Richardson&#x27;s endorsement, but that he was outraged. &#x27;I doubt if Gov. Richardson and I will be terribly close in the future,&#x27; he said, but &#x27;I&#x27;ve had my say. . . . I got one in the wheelhouse and I tagged him.&#x27;&quot;

===whiff===
In general usage, the word &quot;whiff&quot; may refer to the movement or sound of air or wind, perhaps as an object moves through it. In baseball a whiff is when a batter swings and misses a pitch. Such usage in baseball is attributed by the &quot;OED&quot; to 1913. Perhaps derived from this, the term &quot;whiff&quot; has also come to mean trying and failing at something. Also see &quot;swing and miss&quot;.
&quot;After Richardson whiffed on the question, Joe Biden parked it&quot;. 
&quot;Yahoo and MSN each whiffed on six questions. There was only one question that baffled all the search engines&quot;.

===whole new ball game===
Also brand-new ball game; whole &#x27;nother ball game. In common usage, a &quot;whole new ball game&quot; or &quot;brand-new ball game&quot; signifies a drastic turn of events, a completely altered situation. In baseball, an announcer says &quot;it&#x27;s a whole new ball game&quot; when the trailing team ties the score or takes the lead, usually after being behind by several runs. &quot;AHDI&quot; traces this to the 1960s. A &quot;whole &#x27;nother ball game&quot; signifies something completely unrelated, different, or irrelevant. Also said extensively and out of context in the world of selling ads for trade mags.
Under the headline &quot;It&#x27;s a Whole New Ballgame for Obama,&quot; it is stated, &quot;Barack Obama, we all know by now, is not an ideologue. But where his roots are planted is also nowhere near the progressive pendulum, particularly on domestic issues. Now he&#x27;s got a playing field that suits his natural political conservatism&quot;. – Taylor Marsh, &quot;Huffington Post,&quot; 7 January 2011.
&quot;In fact, on-demand applications are a whole &#x27;nother ballgame — which is why personally I try to avoid the popular phrase software as a service (SaaS) since I feel it&#x27;s a phrase that&#x27;s born of the &#x27;nothing changes&#x27; mindset&quot;. – Phil Wainewright, &quot;ZDNet,&quot; 16 March 2006.
