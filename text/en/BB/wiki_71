<text>The timeline of meteorology contains events of scientific and technological advancements in the area of atmospheric sciences. The most notable advancements in observational meteorology, weather forecasting, climatology, atmospheric chemistry, and atmospheric physics are listed chronologically. Some historical weather events are included that mark time periods where advancements were made, or even that sparked policy change.

==Antiquity==
* 3000 BC – Meteorology in India can be traced back to around 3000 BC, with writings such as the Upanishads, containing discussions about the processes of cloud formation and rain and the seasonal cycles caused by the movement of the Earth around the Sun.
* 600 BC – Thales may qualify as the first Greek meteorologist. He reputedly issues the first seasonal crop forecast.
* 400 BC – There is some evidence that Democritus predicted changes in the weather, and that he used this ability to convince people that he could predict other future events.
* 400 BC – Hippocrates writes a treatise called &quot;Airs, Waters and Places&quot;, the earliest known work to include a discussion of weather. More generally, he wrote about common diseases that occur in particular locations, seasons, winds and air.
* 350 BC – The Greek philosopher Aristotle writes &quot;Meteorology&quot;, a work which represents the sum of knowledge of the time about Earth sciences, including weather and climate. It is the first known work that attempts to treat a broad range of meteorological topics. For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation falls are called meteors, which originate from the Greek word &quot;meteoros&quot;, meaning &#x27;high in the sky&#x27;. From that word comes the modern term meteorology, the study of clouds and weather. 
:Although the term &quot;meteorology&quot; is used today to describe a subdiscipline of the atmospheric sciences, Aristotle&#x27;s work is more general. Meteorologica is based on intuition and simple observation, but not on what is now considered the scientific method. In his own words:
::&quot;...all the affections we may call common to air and water, and the kinds and parts of the earth and the affections of its parts.&quot;

::The magazine &quot;De Mundo&quot; (attributed to Pseudo-Aristotle) notes: 
::&quot;Cloud is a vaporous mass, concentrated and producing water. Rain is produced from the compression of a closely condensed cloud, varying according to the pressure exerted on the cloud; when the pressure is slight it scatters gentle drops; when it is great it produces a more violent fall, and we call this a shower, being heavier than ordinary rain, and forming continuous masses of water falling over earth. Snow is produced by the breaking up of condensed clouds, the cleavage taking place before the change into water; it is the process of cleavage which causes its resemblance to foam and its intense whiteness, while the cause of its coldness is the congelation of the moisture in it before it is dispersed or rarefied. When snow is violent and falls heavily we call it a blizzard. Hail is produced when snow becomes densified and acquires impetus for a swifter fall from its close mass; the weight becomes greater and the fall more violent in proportion to the size of the broken fragments of cloud. Such then are the phenomena which occur as the result of moist exhalation.&quot;
:One of the most impressive achievements in &quot;Meteorology&quot; is his description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle:
::&quot;Now the sun, moving as it does, sets up processes of change and becoming and decay, and by its agency the finest and sweetest water is every day carried up and is dissolved into vapour and rises to the upper region, where it is condensed again by the cold and so returns to the earth.&quot;

*Several years after Aristotle&#x27;s book, his pupil Theophrastus puts together a book on weather forecasting called &quot;The Book of Signs&quot;. Various indicators such as solar and lunar halos formed by high clouds are presented as ways to forecast the weather. The combined works of Aristotle and Theophrastus have such authority they become the main influence in the study of clouds, weather and weather forecasting for nearly 2000 years.
* 250 BC – Archimedes studies the concepts of buoyancy and the hydrostatic principle. Positive buoyancy is necessary for the formation of convective clouds (cumulus, cumulus congestus and cumulonimbus).
* 25 AD – Pomponius Mela, a geographer for the Roman Empire, formalizes the climatic zone system.
* c. 80 AD – In his &quot;Lunheng&quot; (論衡; Critical Essays), the Han dynasty Chinese philosopher Wang Chong (27–97 AD) dispels the Chinese myth of rain coming from the heavens, and states that rain is evaporated from water on the earth into the air and forms clouds, stating that clouds condense into rain and also form dew, and says when the clothes of people in high mountains are moistened, this is because of the air-suspended rain water. However, Wang Chong supports his theory by quoting a similar one of Gongyang Gao&#x27;s, the latter&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, the Gongyang Zhuan, compiled in the 2nd century BC, showing that the Chinese conception of rain evaporating and rising to form clouds goes back much farther than Wang Chong. Wang Chong wrote:
::&quot;As to this coming of rain from the mountains, some hold that the clouds carry the rain with them, dispersing as it is precipitated (and they are right). Clouds and rain are really the same thing. Water evaporating upwards becomes clouds, which condense into rain, or still further into dew.&quot;

==Middle Ages==
* 500 AD – In around 500 AD, the Indian astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer: Varāhamihira published his work Brihat-Samhita&#x27;s, which provides clear evidence that a deep knowledge of atmospheric processes existed in the Indian region.
* 7th century – The poet Kalidasa in his epic Meghaduta, mentions the date of onset of the south-west Monsoon over central India and traces the path of the monsoon clouds.
* 7th century – St. Isidore of Seville,in his work &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot;, writes about astronomy, cosmology and meteorology. In the chapter dedicated to Meteorology, he discusses the thunder, clouds, rainbows and wind.
* 9th century – Al-Kindi (Alkindus), an Arab naturalist, writes a treatise on meteorology entitled &quot;Risala fi l-Illa al-Failali l-Madd wa l-Fazr&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Efficient Cause of the Flow and Ebb&quot;), in which he presents an argument on tides which &quot;depends on the changes which take place in bodies owing to the rise and fall of temperature.&quot;
* 9th century – Al-Dinawari, a Kurdish naturalist, writes the &quot;Kitab al-Nabat&quot; (&quot;Book of Plants&quot;), in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the Muslim Agricultural Revolution. He describes the meteorological character of the sky, the planets and constellations, the Sun and Moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, the &quot;anwa&quot; (heavenly bodies of rain), and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes, wells and other sources of water.
* 10th century – Ibn Wahshiyya&#x27;s &quot;Nabatean Agriculture&quot; discusses the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations; signs of rain based on observation of the lunar phases, nature of thunder and lightning, direction of sunrise, behaviour of certain plants and animals, and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds; pollenized air and winds; and formation of winds and vapours.
* 1021 – Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) writes on the atmospheric refraction of light, the cause of morning and evening twilight. He endeavored by use of hyperbola and geometric optics to chart and formulate basic laws on atmospheric refraction. He provides the first correct definition of the twilight, discusses atmospheric refraction, shows that the twilight is due to atmospheric refraction and only begins when the Sun is 19 degrees below the horizon, and uses a complex geometric demonstration to measure the height of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere as 52,000 &quot;passuum&quot; (49 miles), which is very close to the modern measurement of 50 miles. 
* 1020s – Ibn al-Haytham publishes his &quot;Risala fi l-Daw’&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Light&quot;) as a supplement to his &quot;Book of Optics&quot;. He discusses the meteorology of the rainbow, the density of the atmosphere, and various celestial phenomena, including the eclipse, twilight and moonlight.
* 1027 – Avicenna publishes &quot;The Book of Healing&quot;, in which Part 2, Section 5, contains his essay on mineralogy and meteorology in six chapters: formation of mountains; the advantages of mountains in the formation of clouds; sources of water; origin of earthquakes; formation of minerals; and the diversity of earth&#x27;s terrain. He also describes the structure of a meteor, and his theory on the formation of metals combined the alchemical sulfur-mercury theory of metals (although he was critical of alchemy) with the mineralogical theories of Aristotle and Theophrastus. His scientific methodology of field observation was also original in the Earth sciences.
* Late 11th century – Abu &#x27;Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ma&#x27;udh, who lived in Al-Andalus, wrote a work on optics later translated into Latin as &quot;Liber de crepisculis&quot;, which was mistakenly attributed to Alhazen. This was a short work containing an estimation of the angle of depression of the sun at the beginning of the morning twilight and at the end of the evening twilight, and an attempt to calculate on the basis of this and other data the height of the atmospheric moisture responsible for the refraction of the sun&#x27;s rays. Through his experiments, he obtained the accurate value of 18°, which comes close to the modern value.
* 1088 – In his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; (夢溪筆談), the Chinese scientist Shen Kuo wrote vivid descriptions of tornadoes, that rainbows were formed by the shadow of the sun in rain, occurring when the sun would shine upon it, and the curious common phenomena of the effect of lightning that, when striking a house, would merely scorch the walls a bit but completely melt to liquid all metal objects inside.
* 1121 – Al-Khazini, a Muslim scientist of Byzantine Greek descent, publishes &quot;The Book of the Balance of Wisdom&quot;, the first study on the hydrostatic balance.
*13th century – St. Albert the Great is the first to propose that each drop of falling rain had the form of a small sphere, and that this form meant that the rainbow was produced by light interacting with each raindrop.

* 1547 − Antonio Mizauld publishes &quot;Le miroueer du temps, autrement dit, éphémérides perpétuelles de l&#x27;air par lesquelles sont tous les jours donez vrais signes de touts changements de temps, seulement par choses qui à tous apparoissent au cien, en l&#x27;air, sur terre &amp; en l&#x27;eau. Le tout par petits aphorismes, &amp; breves sentences diligemment compris&quot; in Paris, with detail on forecasting weather, comets and earthquakes.

==17th century==

* 1607 – Galileo Galilei constructs a thermoscope. Not only did this device measure temperature, but it represented a paradigm shift. Up to this point, heat and cold were believed to be qualities of Aristotle&#x27;s elements (fire, water, air, and earth). &quot;Note: There is some controversy about who actually built this first thermoscope. There is some evidence for this device being independently built at several different times.&quot; This is the era of the first recorded meteorological observations. As there was no standard measurement, they were of little use until the work of Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit and Anders Celsius in the 18th century.

* 1783 – In Lavoisier&#x27;s article &quot;Reflexions sur le phlogistique&quot;, he deprecates the phlogiston theory and proposes a caloric theory of heat.
:: – First hair hygrometer demonstrated. The inventor was Horace-Bénédict de Saussure.

==19th century==

* 1800 – The Voltaic pile was the first modern electric battery, invented by Alessandro Volta, which led to later inventions like the telegraph.
* 1802–1803 – Luke Howard writes &quot;On the Modification of Clouds&quot; in which he assigns cloud types Latin names. Howard&#x27;s system establishes three physical categories or &quot;forms&quot; based on appearance and process of formation: &quot;cirriform&quot; (mainly detached and wispy), &quot;cumuliform&quot; or convective (mostly detached and heaped, rolled, or rippled), and non-convective &quot;stratiform&quot; (mainly continuous layers in sheets). These are cross-classified into &quot;lower&quot; and &quot;upper&quot; levels or étages. Cumuliform clouds forming in the lower level are given the genus name cumulus from the Latin word for &quot;heap&quot;, while low stratiform clouds are given the genus name stratus from the Latin word for a flattened or spread out &quot;sheet&quot;. Cirriform clouds are identified as always upper level and given the genus name cirrus from the Latin for &quot;hair&quot;. From this genus name, the prefix &quot;cirro-&quot; is derived and attached to the names of upper level cumulus and stratus, yielding the names cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus. In addition to these individual cloud types; Howard adds two names to designate cloud systems consisting of more than one form joined together or located in very close proximity. Cumulostratus describes large cumulus clouds blended with stratiform layers in the lower or upper levels. The term nimbus, taken from the Latin word for &quot;rain cloud&quot;, is given to complex systems of cirriform, cumuliform, and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation, and it comes to be identified as a distinct &quot;nimbiform&quot; physical category.

* 1822 – Joseph Fourier formally introduces the use of dimensions for physical quantities in his &quot;Theorie Analytique de la Chaleur&quot;.
* 1824 – Sadi Carnot analyzes the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory; he develops the notion of a reversible process and, in postulating that no such thing exists in nature, lays the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics.

* 1835 – Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis publishes theoretical discussions of machines with revolving parts and their efficiency, for example the efficiency of waterwheels. At the end of the 19th century, meteorologists recognized that the way the Earth&#x27;s rotation is taken into account in meteorology is analogous to what Coriolis discussed: an example of Coriolis Effect.
* 1836 – An American scientist, Dr. David Alter, invented the first known American electric telegraph in Elderton, Pennsylvania, one year before the much more popular Morse telegraph was invented.
* 1837 – Samuel Morse independently developed an electrical telegraph, an alternative design that was capable of transmitting over long distances using poor quality wire. His assistant, Alfred Vail, developed the Morse code signaling alphabet with Morse. The first electric telegram using this device was sent by Morse on May 24, 1844, from the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. to the B&amp;O Railroad &quot;outer depot&quot; in Baltimore and sent the message:
::&quot;What hath God wrought&quot;
* 1839 – The &quot;first commercial&quot; electrical telegraph was constructed by Sir William Fothergill Cooke and entered use on the Great Western Railway. Cooke and Wheatstone patented it in May 1837 as an alarm system.
* 1840 – Elias Loomis becomes the first person known to attempt to devise a theory on frontal zones. The idea of fronts do not catch on until expanded upon by the Norwegians in the years following World War I.
:: – German meteorologist Ludwig Kaemtz adds stratocumulus to Howard&#x27;s canon as a mostly detached low-étage genus of &quot;limited&quot; convection. It is defined as having cumuliform and stratiform characteristics integrated into a single layer (in contrast to cumulostratus which is deemed to be composite in nature and can be structured into more than one layer). This eventually leads to the formal recognition of a &quot;stratocumuliform&quot; physical category that includes rolled and rippled clouds classified separately from the more freely convective heaped cumuliform clouds.

* 1850 – Rankine uses his &quot;vortex&quot; theory to establish accurate relationships between the temperature, pressure, and density of gases, and expressions for the latent heat of evaporation of a liquid; he accurately predicts the surprising fact that the apparent specific heat of saturated steam will be negative.
:: – Rudolf Clausius gives the first clear joint statement of the first and second law of thermodynamics, abandoning the caloric theory, but preserving Carnot&#x27;s principle.
* 1852 – Joule and Thomson demonstrate that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the Joule-Thomson effect.
* 1853 – The first International Meteorological Conference was held in Brussels at the initiative of Matthew Fontaine Maury, U.S. Navy, recommending standard observing times, methods of observation and logging format for weather reports from ships at sea.
* 1854 – The French astronomer Leverrier showed that a storm in the Black Sea could be followed across Europe and would have been predictable if the telegraph had been used. A service of storm forecasts was established a year later by the Paris Observatory.
:: – Rankine introduces his &quot;thermodynamic function&quot;, later identified as entropy.
* Mid 1850s – Emilien Renou, director of the Parc Saint-Maur and Montsouris observatories, begins work on an elaboration of Howard&#x27;s classifications that would lead to the introduction during the 1870s of a newly defined &quot;middle&quot; étage . Clouds in this altitude range are given the prefix &quot;alto-&quot; derived from the Latin word &quot;altum&quot; pertaining to height above the low-level clouds. This resultes in the genus name altocumulus for mid-level cumuliform and stratocumuliform types and altostratus for stratiform types in the same altitude range.
* 1856 – William Ferrel publishes his .
* 1859 – James Clerk Maxwell discovers the distribution law of molecular velocities.

* 1876 – Josiah Willard Gibbs publishes the first of two papers (the second appears in 1878) which discuss phase equilibria, statistical ensembles, the free energy as the driving force behind chemical reactions, and chemical thermodynamics in general.
* 1880 – Philip Weilbach, secretary and librarian at the Art Academy in Copenhagen proposes and has accepted by the permanent committee of the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), a forerunner of the present-day World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the designation of a new free-convective vertical or multi-étage genus type, cumulonimbus (heaped rain cloud). It would be distinct from cumulus and nimbus and identifiable by its often very complex structure (frequently including a cirriform top and what are now recognized as multiple accessory clouds), and its ability to produce thunder. With this addition, a canon of ten tropospheric cloud &quot;genera&quot; is established that comes to be officially and universally accepted. Howard&#x27;s cumulostratus is not included as a distinct type, having effectively been reclassified into its component cumuliform and stratiform genus types already included in the new canon.
* 1881 – Finnish Meteorological Central Office was formed from part of Magnetic Observatory of Helsinki University.
* 1890 – US Weather Bureau is created as a civilian operation under the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
:: – Otto Jesse reveals the discovery and identification of the first clouds known to form above the troposphere. He proposes the name &quot;noctilucent&quot; which is Latin for &quot;night shining&quot;. Because of the extremely high altitudes of these clouds in what is now known to be the mesosphere, they can become illuminated by the sun&#x27;s rays when the sky is nearly dark after sunset and before sunrise.
* 1892 – William Henry Dines invented another kind of anemometer, called the pressure-tube (Dines) anemometer. His device measured the difference in pressure arising from wind blowing in a tube versus that blowing across the tube.
:: – The first mention of the term &quot;El Niño&quot; to refer to climate occurs when Captain Camilo Carrilo told the Geographical society congress in Lima that Peruvian sailors named the warm northerly current &quot;El Niño&quot; because it was most noticeable around Christmas.

:: – H.H. Clayton proposes formalizing the division of clouds by their physical structures into cirriform, stratiform, &quot;flocciform&quot; (stratocumuliform) and cumuliform. With the later addition of cumulonimbiform, the idea eventually finds favor as an aid in the analysis of satellite cloud images.
* 1898 – US Weather Bureau established a hurricane warning network at Kingston, Jamaica.

==20th century==

* 1919 – Norwegian cyclone model introduced for the first time in meteorological literature. Marks a revolution in the way the atmosphere is conceived and immediately starts leading to improved forecasts.
::- Sakuhei Fujiwhara is the first to note that hurricanes move with the larger scale flow, and later publishes a paper on the Fujiwhara effect in 1921.
* 1920 – Milutin Milanković proposes that long term climatic cycles may be due to changes in the eccentricity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit and changes in the Earth&#x27;s obliquity.

* 1930, January 30 – Pavel Molchanov invents and launches the first radiosonde. Named &quot;271120&quot;, it was released 13:44 Moscow Time in Pavlovsk, USSR from the Main Geophysical Observatory, reached a height of 7.8 kilometers measuring temperature there (−40.7 °C) and sent the first aerological message to the Leningrad Weather Bureau and Moscow Central Forecast Institute.
* 1932 – A further modification of Luke Howard&#x27;s cloud classification system comes when an IMC commission for the study of clouds puts forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus which is effectively reclassified as a stratiform cloud type. It is renamed nimbostratus (flattened or spread out rain cloud) and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the &quot;International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky&quot;. This leaves cumulonimbus as the only nimbiform type as indicated by its root-name.
* 1933 – Victor Schauberger publishes his theories on the carbon cycle and its relationship to the weather in &quot;Our Senseless Toil&quot;

:: – Hurricanes begin to be named alphabetically with the radio alphabet.
:: – WMO World Meteorological Organization replaces IMO under the auspice of the United Nations.
* 1953 – National Hurricane Center (NOAA) creates a system for naming hurricanes using alphabetical lists of women&#x27;s names.
* 1954 – First routine real-time numerical weather forecasting. The Royal Swedish Air Force Weather Service.
:: – A United States Navy rocket captures a picture of an inland tropical depression near the Texas/Mexico border, which leads to a surprise flood event in New Mexico. This convinces the government to set up a weather satellite program.
* 1955 – Norman Phillips at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, runs first Atmospheric General Circulation Model.
:: – NSSP National Severe Storms Project and NHRP National Hurricane Research Projects established. The Miami office of the United States Weather Bureau is designated the main hurricane warning center for the Atlantic Basin.
* 1957–1958 – International Geophysical Year coordinated research efforts in eleven sciences, focused on polar areas during the solar maximum.

* 1959 – The first weather satellite, Vanguard 2, was launched on February 17. It was designed to measure cloud cover, but a poor axis of rotation kept it from collecting a notable amount of useful data.
* 1960 – The first successful weather satellite, TIROS-1 (Television Infrared Observation Satellite), is launched on April 1 from Cape Canaveral, Florida by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with the participation of The US Army Signal Research and Development Lab, RCA, the US Weather Bureau, and the US Naval Photographic Center. During its 78-day mission, it relays thousands of pictures showing the structure of large-scale cloud regimes, and proves that satellites can provide useful surveillance of global weather conditions from space. TIROS paves the way for the Nimbus program, whose technology and findings are the heritage of most of the Earth-observing satellites NASA and NOAA have launched since then.
* 1961 – Edward Lorenz accidentally discovers Chaos theory when working on numerical weather prediction.
* 1962 – Keith Browning and Frank Ludlam publish first detailed study of a &quot;supercell&quot; storm (over Wokingham, UK). Project STORMFURY begins its 10-year project of seeding hurricanes with silver iodide, attempting to weaken the cyclones.
* 1968 – A hurricane database for Atlantic hurricanes is created for NASA by Charlie Newmann and John Hope, named HURDAT.
* 1969 – Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale created, used to describe hurricane strength on a category range of 1 to 5. Popularized during Hurricane Gloria of 1985 by media.
:: – Jacob Bjerknes described ENSO by suggesting that an anomalously warm spot in the eastern Pacific can weaken the east-west temperature difference, causing weakening in the Walker circulation and trade wind flows, which push warm water to the west.
* 1970s Weather radars are becoming more standardized and organized into networks. The number of scanned angles was increased to get a three-dimensional view of the precipitation, which allowed studies of thunderstorms. Experiments with the Doppler effect begin.
* 1970 – NOAA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration established. Weather Bureau is renamed the National Weather Service.
* 1971 – Ted Fujita introduces the Fujita scale for rating tornadoes.
* 1974 – AMeDAS network, developed by Japan Meteorological Agency used for gathering regional weather data and verifying forecast performance, begun operation on November 1, the system consists of about 1,300 stations with automatic observation equipment. These stations, of which more than 1,100 are unmanned, are located at an average interval of 17 km throughout Japan.
* 1975 – The first Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, GOES, was launched into orbit. Their role and design is to aid in hurricane tracking. Also this year, Vern Dvorak develops a scheme to estimate tropical cyclone intensity from satellite imagery.
:: – The first use of a General Circulation Model to study the effects of carbon dioxide doubling. Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald at Princeton University.
* 1976 – The United Kingdom Department of Industry publishes a modification of the international cloud classification system adapted for satellite cloud observations. It is co-sponsored by NASA and showes a division of clouds into stratiform, cirriform, stratocumuliform, cumuliform, and cumulonimbiform. The last of these constitutes a change in name of the earlier nimbiform type, although this earlier name and original meaning pertaining to all rain clouds can still be found in some classifications.

&quot;Major types shown here include the ten tropospheric genera that are detectable (but not always identifiable) by satellite, and several additional major types above the troposphere that were not included with the original modification. The cumulus genus includes four species that indicate vertical size and structure&quot;.

* 1980s onwards, networks of weather radars are further expanded in the developed world. Doppler weather radar is becoming gradually more common, adds velocity information.
* 1982 – The first Synoptic Flow experiment is flown around Hurricane Debby to help define the large scale atmospheric winds that steer the storm.
* 1988 – WSR-88D type weather radar implemented in the United States. Weather surveillance radar that uses several modes to detect severe weather conditions.
* 1992 – Computers first used in the United States to draw surface analyses.
* 1997 – The Pacific Decadal Oscillation was discovered by a team studying salmon production patterns at the University of Washington.
* 1998 – Improving technology and software finally allows for the digital underlying of satellite imagery, radar imagery, model data, and surface observations improving the quality of United States Surface Analyses.
:: – CAMEX3, a NASA experiment run in conjunction with NOAA&#x27;s Hurricane Field Program collects detailed data sets on Hurricanes Bonnie, Danielle, and Georges.
* 1999 – Hurricane Floyd induces &quot;fright factor&quot; in some coastal States and causes a massive evacuation from coastal zones from northern Florida to the Carolinas. It comes ashore in North Carolina and results in nearly 80 dead and $4.5 billion in damages mostly due to extensive flooding.

==21st century==

* 2004 – A record number of hurricanes strike Florida in one year, Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne.
* 2005 – A record 27 named storms occur in the Atlantic. National Hurricane Center runs out of names from its standard list and uses Greek alphabet for the first time.
* 2006 – Weather radar improved by adding common precipitation to it such as freezing rain, rain and snow mixed, and snow for the first time.
* 2007 – The Fujita scale is replaced with the Enhanced Fujita scale for National Weather Service tornado assessments.
* 2010s – Weather radar dramatically advances with more detailed options.
* 2018 — Multiple European government meteorological agencies along with the European Severe Storms Laboratory draft the International Fujita scale.

<text>The gens Rabiria was a minor plebeian family at Ancient Rome. Although of senatorial rank, few members of this gens appear in history, and the only one known to have held any of the higher offices of the Roman state was Gaius Rabirius Postumus, who was praetor &quot;circa&quot; 48 or 47 BC.

==Origin==
The great majority of Rabirii known from inscriptions lived in Italy, and a large family of this name seems to have lived at Tusculum, an ancient city of Latium not far from Rome. Another of the Rabirii bears the cognomen &quot;Tiburtinus&quot;, indicating that he or his ancestors probably came from Tibur, another city of northern Latium, not far from Rome and Tusculum, and strongly suggesting that the Rabirii were Latins.

==Praenomina==
The chief praenomina of the Rabirii are &quot;Gaius&quot; and &quot;Publius&quot;, both of which were among the most common names throughout Roman history. Other praenomina appear sporadically, including &quot;Gnaeus&quot;, &quot;Lucius&quot;, &quot;Marcus&quot;, &quot;Numerius&quot;, &quot;Quintus&quot;, and &quot;Sextus&quot;.

==Members==
* Gaius Rabirius, an elderly senator brought to trial in 63 BC on a charge of &quot;perduellio&quot;, based on his association with the mob that killed the tribune of the plebs Lucius Appuleius Saturninus nearly forty years earlier. Rabirius was defended by Cicero to no avail, but escaped death when the trial was interrupted by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer.
* Rabiria, sister of the senator Rabirius, married Gaius Curius, a publican, and was the mother of Gaius Rabirius Postumus.
* Gaius Rabirius C. f. Postumus, born Gaius Curius, was adopted by his uncle, the senator Gaius Rabirius. He earned his fortune as a money-lender, and his chief client was Ptolemy Auletes, the exiled King of Egypt. He was subsequently tried and banished for &quot;repetundae&quot;, or extortion, despite Cicero&#x27;s defense in 54 BC, but was recalled by Caesar, under whom he served during the Civil War.
* Rabirius, an Epicurean philosopher.
* Gaius Rabirius, an epic poet of the early first century. He seems to have written about the civil wars that attended the end of the Republic.
* Rabirius, a physician and author on medical topics, mentioned by Pliny.
* Rabirius, an architect active during the reign of Domitian, whose palace has been attributed to Rabirius. His artistic skill and virtuous life are described by Martial.
* Rabiria, apparently the wife of a certain &quot;Cossus&quot;, presumably one of the Cornelii Lentuli, although which is uncertain.

<doc id="236582" wikidata="Q127349" url="?curid=236582" title="José Echegaray">
<text>José Echegaray y Eizaguirre (19 April 183214 September 1916) was a Spanish civil engineer, mathematician, , and one of the leading Spanish dramatists of the last quarter of the 19th century. He was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;in recognition of the numerous and brilliant compositions which, in an individual and original manner, have revived the great traditions of the Spanish drama&quot;.

== Early life ==
He was born in Madrid on 19 April 1832. His father, a doctor and institute professor of Greek, was from Aragon and his mother was from Navarra. He spent his childhood in Murcia, where he finished his elementary school education. It was there, at the Murcia Institute, where he first gained his love for mathematics. While still a child he read Goethe, Homer, and Balzac, readings that alternated with those of mathematicians like Gauss, Legendre, and Lagrange.

In order to earn enough money to attend the (Engineering School of Roads, Channels and Ports), he moved at the age of fourteen to Madrid. At the age of twenty, he left the Madrid School with a Civil Engineering degree, which he had obtained as first in his class, and he had to move to Almeria and Granada to begin working at his first job.

== Professor and scientist ==
In 1854 he began teaching a class at the Engineering School, working as a secretary there also. He taught mathematics, stereotomy, hydraulics, descriptive geometry, and differential and physical calculus from that year until 1868. From 1858 to 1860 he was also a professor at the Assistants&#x27; School of Public Works.

His (1865) and (1867) were held in some regard. He became a member of the Society of Political Economy, helped to found the magazine , and took a prominent part in propagating free trade doctrines in the press and on the platform.

He was clearly marked out for office, and when the revolution of 1868 overthrew the monarchy, he resigned his post for a place in the revolutionary cabinet.

==Government service==
Echegaray also entered politics later in his life. As a founding member of the republican Radical Democratic Party, he enjoyed a career in the government sector, being appointed Minister of Education, of Public Works and Finance Minister successively between 1867 and 1874. He retired from politics after the Bourbon restoration in 1874.

==Literary career==
Theater had always been the love of José Echegaray&#x27;s life. Although he had written earlier plays (&quot;La Hija natural&quot; and &quot;La Última Noche&quot;, both in 1867), he truly became a dramatist in 1874. His plays reflected his sense of duty, which had made him famous during his time in the governmental offices. Dilemmas centered on duty and morality are the motif of his plays. He replicated the achievements of his predecessors of the Spanish Golden Age, remaining a prolific playwright.

His most famous play is &quot;El gran Galeoto&quot;, a drama written in the grand nineteenth century manner of melodrama. It is about the poisonous effect that unfounded gossip has on a middle-aged man&#x27;s happiness. Echegaray filled it with elaborate stage instructions that illuminate what we would now consider a hammy style of acting popular in the 19th century. Paramount Pictures filmed it as a silent with the title changed to &quot;The World and His Wife&quot;, and it was the basis for a later film The Great Galeoto. His most remarkable plays are &quot;O locura o santidad&quot; (Saint or Madman?, 1877); &quot;Mariana&quot; (1892); &quot;El estigma&quot; (1895); &quot;La duda&quot;, 1898; and &quot;El loco Dios&quot; (God, the fool, 1900).

Among his other famous plays are &quot;La esposa del vengador&quot; (1874) (The Avenger&#x27;s Wife); &quot;En el puño de la espada&quot; (1875) (In the Sword&#x27;s Handle); &quot;En el pilar y en la cruz&quot; (1878) (On the Stake and on the Cross); and &quot;Conflicto entre dos deberes&quot; (1882) (Conflict of Two Duties).

Along with the Provençal poet Frédéric Mistral, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904, after having been nominated that year by a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, making him the first Spaniard to win the prize.

José Echegaray maintained constant activity until his death on 14 September 1916 in Madrid. His extensive work did not stop growing in his old age: in the final stage of his life he wrote 25 or 30 mathematical physics volumes. At the age of 83 he commented: I cannot die, because if I am going to write my mathematical physics encyclopedia, I need at least 25 more years.

==Honors==
Several streets in Spain are named after José Echegaray. &quot;Calle Echegaray&quot; in Madrid&#x27;s &quot;Barrio de las Letras&quot; is especially noteworthy. In 1971 the Bank of Spain issued a 1000-peseta banknote in his honor.

<doc id="236584" wikidata="Q620413" url="?curid=236584" title="Paralegal">
<text>A paralegal, also known as a legal assistant or paralegal specialist, is a legal professional who performs tasks that require knowledge of legal concepts but not the full expertise of a lawyer with an admission to practice law. The market for paralegals is broad, including consultancies, companies that have legal departments or that perform legislative and regulatory compliance activities in areas such as environment, labor, intellectual property, zoning, and tax. Legal offices and public bodies also have many paralegals in support activities using other titles outside of the standard titles used in the profession. There is a diverse array of work experiences attainable within the paralegal (legal assistance) field, ranging between internship, entry-level, associate, junior, mid-senior, and senior level positions.

In the United States in 1967, the American Bar Association (ABA) endorsed the concept of the paralegal and, in 1968, established its first committee on legal assistants. In 2018, the ABA amended their definition of paralegal removing the reference to legal assistants. The current definition reads as follows, &quot;A paralegal is a person, qualified by education, training, or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.&quot;

The exact nature of their work and limitations that the law places on the tasks that they are allowed to perform vary between nations and jurisdictions. Paralegals generally are not allowed to offer legal services independently in most jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, paralegals can conduct their own business and provide services such as settlements, court filings, legal research and other auxiliary legal services; these tasks often have instructions from a solicitor attached. 

Recently, some US and Canadian jurisdictions have begun creating a new profession where experienced paralegals are being licensed, with or without attorney supervision, to allow limited scope of practice in high need practice areas such as family law, bankruptcy and landlord-tenant law in an effort to combat the access to justice crisis. The education, experience, testing, and scope of practice requirements vary widely across the various jurisdictions. So too are the number of titles jurisdictions are using for these new practitioners, including Limited License Legal Technician, Licensed Paralegals, Licensed Paraprofessionals, Limited Licensed Paralegals, Limited License Paraprofessionals, Allied Legal Professionals, etc. 

In the United States, a paralegal is protected from some forms of professional liability under the theory that paralegals are working as an enhancement of an attorney, who takes ultimate responsibility for the supervision of the paralegal&#x27;s work and work product. Paralegals often have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes. Paralegals may analyze and summarize depositions, prepare and answer interrogatories, draft procedural motions and other routine briefs, perform legal research and analysis, legislative assistance (legislative research), draft research memos, and perform some quasi-secretarial or legal secretarial duties, as well as perform case and project management. Paralegals often handle drafting much of the paperwork in probate cases, divorce actions, bankruptcies, and investigations. Consumers of legal services are typically billed for the time paralegals spend on their cases. In the United States, they are not authorized by the government or other agency to offer legal services (including legal advice) except in some cases in Washington State (through LLLT designation) in the same way as lawyers, nor are they officers of the court, nor are they usually subject to government-sanctioned or court-sanctioned rules of conduct. In some jurisdictions (Ontario, Canada, for example) paralegals are licensed and regulated the same way that lawyers are and these licensed professionals may be permitted to provide legal services to the public and appear before certain lower courts and administrative tribunals.

== Official definitions ==
Various professional organizations offer varying definitions of a paralegal.

* From the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (NFPA) [US]: &quot;A paralegal is a person, qualified through education, training or work experience to perform substantive legal work that requires knowledge of legal concepts and is customarily, but not exclusively, performed by a lawyer. This person may be retained or employed by a lawyer, law office, governmental agency or other entity or may be authorized by administrative, statutory or court authority to perform this work. Substantive shall mean work requiring recognition, evaluation, organization, analysis, and communication of relevant facts and legal concepts.&quot;
* From the National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) [US]: &quot;Legal Assistants (also known as paralegals) are a distinguishable group of persons who assist attorneys in the delivery of legal services. Through formal education, training and experience, Legal Assistants have knowledge and expertise regarding the legal system and substantive and procedural law which qualify them to do work of a legal nature under the supervision of an attorney.&quot; This is the NALA&#x27;s former 1984 definition. In 2001, the organization adopted the American Bar Association&#x27;s (ABA) definition of a paralegal/Legal Assistant.
* From National Association of Legal Secretaries (NALS) [US]: &quot;A Legal Assistant, qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.&quot;
* From the American Association for Paralegal Education (AAfPE) [USA]: &quot;Paralegals perform substantive and procedural legal work as authorized by law, which work, in the absence of the paralegal, would be performed by an attorney. Paralegals have knowledge of the law gained through education, or education and work experience, which qualifies them to perform legal work. Paralegals adhere to recognized ethical standards and rules of professional responsibility.&quot;
* From the Institute of Paralegals [United Kingdom]: &quot;A paralegal is a non-lawyer who does legal work that previously would have been done by a lawyer, or if done by a lawyer, would be charged for.&quot;
* From the Paralegal Society of Ontario [Canada]: &quot;A paralegal is an individual qualified through education or experience licensed to provide legal services to the general public in areas authorized by the Law Society of Upper Canada.&quot;
* From the National Association of Licensed Paralegals [United Kingdom]: &quot;A person who is educated and trained to perform legal tasks but who is not a qualified solicitor or barrister.&quot;

== Difference from legal secretaries ==
A legal secretary is generally a secretary who has a basic understanding of legal terminology and the specific formatting required by a particular court or government agency. Legal secretaries are also typically responsible for keeping case files organized and indexed, often taking on the duties of a file clerk. Although legal secretaries may be trained to prepare some basic legal papers and letters, they generally have little or no knowledge of particular legal doctrines, statutes or regulations, and typically have no training or experience in conducting legal research or drafting legal documents, pleadings, motions, briefs or other court papers. On the other hand, a typical paralegal in the United States can perform all of these tasks under an attorney or law office. Paralegals bill for their time at a higher rate than legal secretaries.
In Canada the title Legal Secretary is outdated. The recognized title of that position is Legal Administrative Assistant, or Legal Assistant.

== Education, training, and certification ==

Though not required in most jurisdictions, many paralegals have completed a formal paralegal education program. Formal paralegal education programs may result in a diploma, higher diploma, advanced diploma, vocational education, associate degree, bachelor&#x27;s degree, master&#x27;s degree, or graduate certificate programs in the academic discipline of legal management and paralegal studies, or a paralegal professional certificate of continuing education. Others may enter through adjacent fields of study such as bachelor&#x27;s, academic minors, master&#x27;s, or graduate certificate degree programs in criminology and the sociology of law, political science, public administration, legal studies, sociology, literature and creative writing, history, philosophy, other fields in the social sciences, humanities, and liberal arts, or proof of higher education in any field of study or academic discipline. Many paralegals have completed all of their training or obtained a higher education degree in an adjacent field before entering the profession, while some, mostly those of the Baby Boomers Generation and some older Gen Xers unlike many Millennials, Gen Zers, and younger Gen Xers, have only on-the-job training entering only with a high school diploma and no formal higher education which was a common phenomenon during that time, with others later on completing their education while working their way up from some administrative assistance or secretarial positions in law firms, in-house legal departments, or government agencies where depending on the type of work completed may or may not have required a bachelor&#x27;s degree level of specialized knowledge in a given field. Many paralegals take Continuing Legal Education (CLE), Continuing Education Unit (CEU), or Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses to fulfill the requirements of their firm, employer, government-appointed regulatory body, association, or to obtain and maintain a professional certificate or license to practice.

== Economics ==

Paralegals exist precisely because they are not lawyers and thus can do the work more cheaply. Other than expertise, the main constraint on what work a paralegal can or cannot do tends to be local rules that reserve particular activities to lawyers. Some jurisdictions have a reserved activities list.

According to United States law, there are five specific acts which only a licensed attorney can perform:

# Establish the attorney–client relationship
# Give legal advice
# Sign legal papers and pleadings on behalf of a party
# Appear in court on behalf of another (i.e. the client)
# Set and collect fees for legal services

Beyond the five acts above, the paralegal can perform practically any other task, including legal research, legal writing, factual investigation, preparation of exhibits, and the day-to-day tasks of case management. The key is that attorneys are entirely responsible for the actions of their paralegals and, by signing and filing court documents drafted by paralegals (or law clerks), attorneys make those documents their own.

=== Trends in use ===
In the United States, the need for accredited qualifications and bar licensure limits the number of licensed attorneys. There are some tasks for which a bar license is unnecessary but some amount of legal training is helpful. To lower costs, businesses may choose to employ paralegals to undertake such tasks. Paralegal time is typically billed at only a fraction of what a lawyer charges, and thus to the paralegal has fallen those substantive and procedural tasks which are too complex for legal secretaries (whose time is not billed) but for which lawyers can no longer bill. This in turn makes lawyers more efficient by allowing them to concentrate solely on the substantive legal issues of the case, while paralegals have become the &quot;case managers&quot;.

The growing demand of paralegal professionals at a rapid rate has resulted in schools and colleges catering to such education being established in many places. It has been found through a survey that currently 50,000 students are enrolled in paralegal education courses. The American Association for Paralegal Education (AAPE) itself has more than 450 members; 260 of them are ABA-approved. Seminars and events are being held by various institutes to help broaden the knowledge base of the paralegal service providers and the importance associated with it. Although the nation is experiencing a recession, the paralegal profession continues to grow. Law firms and legal departments are cutting costs and increasing access to legal services by hiring paralegals.

The United Kingdom has gone one step further. Much legal work by lawyers for the poorer elements of society is legally aided, or paid for by the state. As overall costs have risen due to more people than ever engaging with the law, the government has reduced such legal aid. As a result, the work has become uneconomic for many and they have ceased doing it. Paralegal advisory firms are stepping in to fill the gap.

The increased use of paralegals has slowed the rising cost of legal services and serves in some small measure (in combination with contingency fees and insurance) to keep the cost of legal services within the reach of the regular population. However, one commentator has warned that &quot;our profession makes a serious error if it uses legal assistants only as economic tools.&quot;

== Paralegal medical consultants ==
Some attorneys who practice in fields involving medical care have only a limited knowledge of healthcare and medical concepts and terminology. Therefore, legal medical consultants which are professional physicians, physician assistants, paramedics, nurses and respiratory therapists, have become fully trained as paralegals in the manner described above and assist behind the scenes on these cases, in addition to serving as expert witnesses from time to time.

== By country ==
=== Australia ===
Australia has a distinct regime for the utilization of paralegals. According to one paralegal studies scholar:

Furthermore, Australian paralegals have &quot;little formal recognition of, or status accorded&quot; them, yet they &quot;require specialist education.&quot;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, paralegals are typically trained assistants who work under the supervision of lawyers and are not regulated as independent professionals, except in the Canadian province of Ontario. In Ontario, paralegals are licensed professionals regulated by legislation. 

Some provinces, like British Columbia, allow lawyers to designate certain paralegals to provide additional services to clients. However, in most cases, lawyers remain fully responsible for all action or omission of the designated paralegals.

====Ontario====
In Ontario, paralegals are licensed by the Law Society of Ontario. Ontario is with Washington State the only jurisdiction in the western hemisphere where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court. Licensed paralegals operate within a defined scope of practice, representing clients in matters such as provincial offenses (traffic tickets, etc.), immigration, landlord and tenant disputes, labor law, small claims court (up to $35,000), and specific criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates. By virtue of their office, licensed paralegals are commissioners for taking affidavits (swearing oaths).

In the province of Ontario paralegals are a regulated body within the legal system. Paralegals become commissioners upon licensing, and may become non-lawyer notaries, Crown prosecutor, municipal prosecutor or a justice of the peace if appointed.

Ontario recently became the first jurisdiction in North America to provide for the licensing of independent paralegals. This task will be the responsibility of the Law Society of Ontario (founded in 1797), which already regulates Ontario&#x27;s 40,000 or so lawyers. Aspiring paralegals must complete an accredited educational program and complete a licensing exam. The Society will also be responsible for disciplining paralegals who do not conform to rules of professional conduct, known as the Paralegal Rules of Conduct.

In Ontario, as of December 2017, licensed paralegals are now endorsed and recognized as officers of the court.

The Law Society began issuing the first paralegal licenses to grandparent applicants who fulfilled all the necessary licensing requirements (including insurance) in April 2008. Paralegals who provide legal services to the public must carry professional liability insurance in accordance with By-Law 6, Part II, section 12 (1). Licensees must provide written proof of their compliance with this requirement to carry mandatory insurance before they begin providing legal services, as well as on an annual basis. Paralegal services may be provided via a sole proprietorship, partnership or professional corporation. Licensees are strongly encouraged to seek professional advice on the best business structure for their particular situations. A paralegal license allows a paralegal to independently represent clients in provincial offences court, summary conviction criminal court, small claims court and administrative tribunals such as the Financial Services Commission of Ontario or the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. The role that a paralegal has in the United States is similar to the role of a law clerk or legal assistant in Ontario. Many paralegals in Ontario work in the areas of permitted practice for paralegals and also work alongside lawyers in areas of practice that are only permitted to be practiced by lawyers. It is illegal for paralegals in Ontario to independently practice in an area of law that is permitted only for lawyers. An example of this is family law, or an indictable offence in criminal law.

All lawyers and paralegals who practice law and provide legal services in Ontario, are required to complete the CPD program. Continuing professional development (CPD) is the maintenance and enhancement of a lawyer or paralegal&#x27;s professional knowledge, skills, attitudes and professionalism throughout the individual&#x27;s career. It is a positive tool that benefits lawyers and paralegals and is an essential component of the commitment they make to the public to practice law or provide legal services competently and ethically.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, the institution of exists, and functions similarly to paralegals. Scriveners perform legal work, above the level of secretary but below the level of attorney, and may be attached to an attorney&#x27;s office or operate independently. Scriveners may represent clients in some low-level matters, but not in more advanced stages of litigation. As with lawyers in Japan, scriveners are regulated and must pass an exam.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, legal assistants or paralegals must have extensive knowledge of the law and the administration of justice. Their duties may include: liaising with clients of their employers to assist in solving legal problems, legal research, preparing cases for court and liaising with the public. This programme is uniquely designed to impart a comprehensive overview of all aspects of paralegal specialisation and an understanding of individual rights and the rights of others. Paralegal offers the use and application of skills and competencies related to criminal law and procedure, civil litigation, wills and estates, dispute resolution, legal advice, property law and conveyancing as well as legal office practice management and debt collecting/counselling.

Paralegals in South Africa are hired mostly by Legal Aid South Africa, big corporations, Patent law firms, legal firms, Estate agents, Government Departments etc. to provide legal support to those corporate world. Legal support may be by legal research, investigation/inspectors, legal advice or legal assistance. Certification may be acquired at: Tshwane University of Technology National Diploma in Legal Assistance/Paralegal, University of Johannesburg Diploma in Paralegal, UNISA National Diploma in Law, South African School of Paralegals, Intec College Diploma in Paralegal, South African Law School Qualification in Paralegal, Damelin College Paralegal, Boston City Campus Paralegal certificate. Salaries range from R60,000 to R450,000 per year depending on experience.
Newly established law firms in South Africa are likely to hire qualified Paralegals with 3 year qualification in Legal Studies to provide Legal assistance. Though the South African Law Society and The Minister of Justice do want to come with regulation to guide paralegals in South Africa just like Canada and the US, many practicing attorneys and Advocates did disprove in many instances however the new legislation is pending.

=== South Korea ===
Paralegals are not regulated and work as assistants to lawyers in law offices. There is a role of Judicial Scrivener, but it is a different legal role in South Korea
In South Korea a similar system to the Japanese exists, and is known as beopmusa (Hangul: , Hanja: ), but they cannot be compared to the role of a paralegal, as beopmusa&#x27;s can open their own offices and take on tasks of lawyers similar to notaries

=== United Kingdom ===
==== England and Wales ====
The original concept of paralegals in the UK started with the Paralegal Association in the mid-1980s (now the National Association of Licensed Paralegals). However the oldest incorporated professional body for paralegals in the UK who set the competency standards for paralegals and legal secretaries, issue legal qualifications, and support, represent and promote paralegals is the Institute Of Paralegals.

Both the Association and Institute have similar roles in recognizing and registering Paralegals but do not always agree on all the principles of practice.

However, it is only recently that paralegals have begun to be seen as more than merely assistants to qualified lawyers. They are now a newly emergent, and increasingly distinct, group of legal professionals.

Due to a lack of metrics it is unclear exactly how many paralegals there are in the United Kingdom. The Office of National Statistics and the register of Standard Occupational Classification estimate that there are currently 76,000 mid-skilled &quot;legal associate professionals&quot;. Research published in 2014 by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) predicts that this figure is set to grow by 17% within the next decade. Moreover, it is estimated that there are now almost 4,000 government registered/regulated paralegal advisory firms offering services that would previously have been offered only by lawyers.This is because most legal work in the United Kingdom is deregulated and therefore there is nothing to stop anyone from opening their own paralegal law firm.

As the term &#x27;paralegal&#x27; is not protected like the term &#x27;solicitor&#x27; anyone may call himself/herself a paralegal without any qualification or registrations. Professional bodies are lobbying for this to change and the term &#x27;paralegal&#x27; to become a protected title.

Paralegals in England and Wales may only offer limited legal advice, as may any person, with the following exceptions strictly forbidden:

# Undertaking the activities reserved to solicitors under the Solicitors Act 1974;
# Undertaking immigration work if not registered with the Office of the Immigrations Services Commissioner;
# Undertaking certain types of claims/compensation related work if not registered with the Ministry of Justice.

In the United Kingdom, the Solicitors Act 1974 reserves certain activities for solicitors. Broadly, these include:
* Preparing and lodging documents concerning the conveying or charging of land. Since repealed and now also conducted by Licensed Conveyancers
* Undertaking probate law.
* Undertaking litigation (except in the small claims court).

Paralegals technically have very limited rights to conduct litigation/rights of audience before courts/tribunals. In practice though many appear in courts and particularly tribunals at all levels as assistants.

Paralegals also act as Police Station Representatives if they are accredited, giving general advice to clients held in police custody.

==== Scotland ====
Scotland has separate legal jurisdiction from England and Wales. The term &quot;paralegal&quot; came into use from the 1980s. There have always been individuals undertaking legal work but not qualified as a solicitor but they would have had other titles such as &#x27;legal assistant&#x27;. From the early 1990s the term &quot;paralegal&quot; became more common. In 1993 Scottish Paralegals Association was founded. It is a voluntary body whose remit is to promote the interests of paralegals in Scotland. From 1991 Scotland&#x27;s colleges began to offer paralegal qualifications, awarded by the Scottish Qualification Authority, namely the Higher National Diploma and Certificate in Legal Services. They were offered by Central College of Commerce, Stevenson College and Dundee College. As a result of the efforts of the Scottish Paralegal Association and in particular its president Christine Lambie, in 2010 the Law Society of Scotland, the solicitors&#x27; professional body, instituted the Law Society of Scotland Registered Paralegal scheme. This was a voluntary scheme providing a professional status for high quality paralegals. Around 400 paralegals, mainly individuals who had come through the ranks in legal firms, joined the scheme. From 2010 Scottish Qualification Authority and Stirling University offered qualifications for individuals wishing to enter the Registered Paralegal profession. Paralegals qualify in particular legal domains, e.g., Domestic Conveyancing; and Wills &amp; Executries. In 2017 the name of the scheme was changed to Law Society of Scotland Accredited Paralegal scheme.

==== Professional societies ====
The largest number of paralegals in the UK are represented by the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEX). Unlike other paralegal bodies CILEX is an Approved Regulator, meaning all its members are independently regulated in the public interest and must comply with a code of conduct, including all its paralegal members. CILEX is also the only body that provides paralegals with a limited progression route to lawyer status.

CILEX provides a non-University route to qualification as lawyer, with the majority of its members learning on-the-job and working as paralegals. It is open to those with or without law degrees, and allows paralegals to progress through to ultimately become fully qualified lawyers, partners, advocates, coroners and judges, subject to achieving the correct level of qualifications, skills, and experience.

Since 1994 City and Guilds, in association with CILEX, has offered the UK&#x27;s leading range of nationally and internationally approved qualifications for paralegals and legal secretaries, which have been taken by over 20,000 people. They offer a Level 2 Award/Certificate/Diploma in Legal Studies qualification. This provides the underpinning knowledge which will help in day-to-day work and will also allows progression onto the CILEX route to becoming a lawyer. The qualification is divided into units and is assessed by way of assignments and a multiple-choice test. A Level 3 Diploma in Vocational Paralegal Studies qualification is also available, and this is equivalent to A-level standard. The qualification is divided into units and again, is assessed by way of assignments. The qualifications are also recognized by the CILEX as a route into their membership grades.

The Institute of Paralegals (IOP) administer a Route to Qualification: the nationally recognized career path for professional paralegals. They also set and administer Competency Standards for paralegals and legal secretaries.
The Institute of Paralegals (IOP) are:
* an incorporated paralegal representative body in the United Kingdom whose application for institute status was supported by the Bar Council, Law Society, Crown Prosecution Service and Citizens Advice
* the only body for professional paralegals to have relied on state funding to help develop the paralegal profession
* an organisation which publishes a Paralegal Code of Conduct
* a member of LawCare
* an organisation which publishes Competency Standards for the paralegal profession (drafted with the assistance of law firms and (in part) by Her Majesty&#x27;s Land Registry and vetted for professional conduct requirements by the Solicitors Regulation Authority)
* an organisation which administers a paralegal career path – the Route to Qualification. The R2Q turns a job into a career, and an occupation into a profession. It is supported by scores of local law societies, university law schools, law firms and others

NALP (National Association of Licensed Paralegals) is an awarding body for paralegal qualifications, recognized as an awarding organisation by Ofqual, the regulator of qualifications in England and Wales. NALP offers self-regulation and Licensing for paralegals in England &amp; Wales. NALP&#x27;s objective is to raise the profile of paralegals in the UK and has dedicated itself to the promoting the status of paralegals and paralegal training in the United Kingdom and abroad. NALP offers training and qualifications at all levels. NALP is a not for profit company limited by guarantee.

There are various levels of certification and membership according to the level of training, qualification and experience. To become a Licensed Paralegal a person should have an acceptable qualification in law, e.g., the Association&#x27;s Diploma in Paralegal Studies, ILEX, Law Degree or HND (plus a procedural law qualification) or any other qualification deemed suitable, and who can satisfy the other criteria laid down by the Association namely: knowledge, competence, dedication, character requirements and continuous professional development.

The Institute of Paralegals (IOD) is an incorporated professional body for paralegals in the UK. A not-for-profit organisation, they set the competency standards for paralegals and legal secretaries, issue legal qualifications, and support, represent and promote paralegals.
The National Association of Licensed Paralegals(NALP) was established in 1987 and is the professional self-regulatory governing body for accredited paralegals. Access into the profession can either be with a law degree or without. Those who are already graduates can take The Post Graduate Diploma in Paralegal Practice (PPC) (similar to the LPC for solicitors). Those that have no previous qualification can do the Diploma in Paralegal Studies. The NALP is an awarding body regulated by OFQUAL and is also a member of the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (based in the US).

As a not-for-profit professional body incorporated by guarantee, they were formed in 2003. They were granted institute status by the UK government in 2005, with the support of, among others, The Law Society of England &amp; Wales, the Bar Council, Citizens Advice and the Crown Prosecution Service, all of whom recognized the need for the developing paralegal profession to have a representative body.

==== Salary ====
In the United Kingdom paralegal salaries in law firms can range from around £15,000 in some rural or suburban areas but may reach as high as £60,000 – £80,000 for the most senior in the larger city firms and some PLCs.
A paralegal can also work as a freelance offering their services to solicitors performing tasks such assisting Counsel at court and taking notes in court and presenting applications to District Judges in chambers. They can be paid on a daily or hourly rate earning up to £60 – £260 per day.

=== United States===

In the United States, paralegals originated as assistants to lawyers at a time when only lawyers offered legal services. In those jurisdictions where the local legal profession/judiciary is involved in paralegal recognition/accreditation, the profession of paralegal still basically refers to those people working under the direct supervision of a lawyer. The profession of paralegal varies greatly between the states, because some states do require paralegals to be licensed. In other jurisdictions however, such as the United Kingdom, the lack of local legal profession/judiciary oversight means that the definition of paralegal encompasses non-lawyers doing legal work, regardless of whom they do it for. Although most jurisdictions recognize paralegals to a greater or lesser extent, there is no international consistency as to definition, job-role, status, terms and conditions of employment, training, regulation or anything else and so each jurisdiction must be looked at individually.

In the United States, there is no such thing as a paralegal &quot;licensed&quot; by a government body; rather, paralegals can be &quot;registered,&quot; &quot;certified,&quot; or &quot;certificated&quot; by private organizations.

There are two major national organizations that offer professional certification to paralegals who meet voluntary regulation standards: the National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) established in 1976 and the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (NFPA) established in 1996.

Both NALA and the NFPA offer professional certification exams that should not be confused with a paralegal certificate offered by an officially accredited college or university.

NALA offers its Certified Legal Assistant or Certified Paralegal examination, a comprehensive two-day examination that covers the following subjects: Communications, Ethics, Legal Research, Judgment and Analytical Ability, American Legal System and four sub-sections selected by the applicants from a list of nine substantive areas of the law. These sub-section tests cover general knowledge of the following practice areas: Administrative Law, Bankruptcy, Business Organizations, Civil Litigation, Contracts, Criminal Law and Procedure, Estate, Planning and Probate, Family Law and Real Estate. After successful completion of the examination, NALA awards the paralegal the &quot;CLA&quot; (Certified Legal Assistant) or &quot;CP&quot; (Certified Paralegal) designation. Both the &quot;CLA&quot; and &quot;CP&quot; designations are proprietary trademarks owned by NALA. Paralegals who have attained further education and received a paralegal certificate are referred to as &quot;Certificated&quot; unless they have passed the examination and have been awarded the &quot;Certified&quot; designation. Additionally, those paralegals who receive the &quot;Certified Paralegal&quot; designation then have the opportunity to earn the &quot;Advanced Certified Paralegal&quot; designation. There is a 45 to 50 percent pass rate for persons taking the NALA exams.

The NFPA offers its non-accredited Paralegal Advanced Competency Exam, which is a four-hour exam on a variety of legal topics; those who pass that exam can call themselves PACE-Registered Paralegals and display the &quot;RP&quot; designation. NFPA&#x27;s core purpose is to advance the paralegal profession and is committed to the profession&#x27;s Code of Ethics.

Some states have considered the licensure of paralegals. Whether paralegals should be licensed or certified is one of the most important issues for paralegals today.

==== Difference from lawyers ====
The greatest differences between lawyers and paralegals are that lawyers give legal advice, can set fees, appear as counsel of record in court, and sign pleadings (and other court documents) in a representative capacity. A paralegal who attempts to do any of these acts will be in violation of the unauthorized practice of law statutes in most U.S. states. Paralegals are responsible for handling tasks such as legal writing, research, and other forms of documentation for the lawyers for whom they work.

==== Penalties for unauthorized practice ====
Paralegals are restrained from exercising independence and prohibited from providing even basic legal advice to consumers of legal advice. In her book, &quot;Access to Justice&quot;, Stanford law professor Deborah Rhode states: &quot;Over four-fifths of surveyed attorneys have supported prosecution of lay practitioners, and the profession has repeatedly blocked licensing proposals that would enable independent paralegals to offer routine services. Many local, state and national bar associations have recently launched initiatives to broaden the definition, raise the penalties, and increase the enforcement of unauthorized practice prohibitions.&quot;

In some areas, legal document assistants actually advertise themselves as paralegals. Many states, including Florida, have enacted laws or bar rules which require any person referring to himself or herself as a paralegal to work under the supervision of a licensed attorney. This rule would prohibit those individuals working as &quot;independent paralegals&quot; from using the title &quot;paralegal&quot;.

==== Salary ====
In the United States, as of May 2021, the median annual salary for a paralegal was US$56,230. Paralegals working for the U.S. federal government average around $73,580 per year while state and local government paralegals earn around $54,000 to $57,000.

===History===
Paralegals have been used in the United States for almost 50 years.

==== Paralegal Day ====
Several state governments have designated a &quot;Paralegal Day&quot;, which is not the same day everywhere, in particular New York&#x27;s governor David Paterson, Michigan&#x27;s governor Jennifer M. Granholm, South Carolina, Idaho&#x27;s governor James E. Risch and the Texas Legislature have designated Paralegal Day in their respective states. California, Connecticut, Ohio, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Utah also have a Paralegal Day.

==== Paralegal service or document preparers ====
There are a variety of services available to the general public depending on the State of residence. These companies have been known as Paralegal Services until they were required to change their names. These companies are now typically known to the general public as Court Document Preparers or Court Forms Providers. The State of Florida has numerous companies that prepare court documents for a variety of issues, such as Divorce, Bankruptcy, Paternity, Custody, Modification of Child Support, Name Change, Wills, Power of Attorney, Quit Claim Deeds, etc. If you do not have the ability to remedy your situation because of the high cost fees of any attorney a Court Document Preparer can save thousands of dollars. Such document preparers, however, frequently come under the scrutiny of various state bar organizations by overstepping the basic document preparation and engaging in what could be considered &quot;unauthorized practice of law.&quot; Such document preparation is indeed cost-saving for those who truly want to represent themselves in a legal matter, but want to pay someone to create the required documents. If problems arise in the legal case, however, the person who hired the paralegal service needs to understand that there is typically no legal liability on the part of the paralegal service and that such institutions cannot be sued for legal malpractice. Again, the philosophy is that the person utilizing such service is representing himself or herself in all legal matters and merely hiring a document preparer.

==== California ====

As of 2022, California &quot;is the only state in the nation that comprehensively regulates the paralegal profession.&quot;

In California, under Business and Professions Code § 6450, a paralegal must have at least one of the following:
# An ABA approved paralegal certificate.
# A certificate of completion of a paralegal program at, or a degree from, a post-secondary institution that requires the successful completion of a minimum of 24 semester, or equivalent, units in law-related courses and that has been accredited by a national or regional accrediting organization or approved by the Bureau for Private Post-secondary and Vocational Education.
# A bachelor&#x27;s degree or advanced degree in any subject and at least one year of experience performing legal tasks under the supervision of an attorney that has at least three years&#x27; legal experience in California himself. The attorney must sign a written declaration stating the paralegal is qualified to perform legal tasks.
# Before December 31, 2003, have completed a high school diploma or general equivalency diploma and a minimum of three years of law-related experience under the supervision of an attorney that has at least three years&#x27; legal experience in California himself. The attorney must sign a written declaration stating the paralegal is qualified to perform legal tasks.

Up until Business and Professions Code § 6450 was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis in 2000, there was little regulation of paralegals in California. One of the purposes of regulation under Business and Professions Code § 6450 was to shut down the paralegals who were providing self-help legal services to consumers. There had been relatively few consumer complaints against paralegals; instead most of the complaints were from lawyers who urged the California State Bar to police the unauthorized practice of law (UPL).

In response, the State Bar appointed a Public Protection Committee to look at the L.A. bar&#x27;s claim. Then, &quot;in 1988, the Public Protection Committee unanimously recommended that the California legislature completely abolish the state&#x27;s UPL laws. It further concluded that independent paralegals should be allowed to provide all types of legal services as long as they are registered with a state agency and disclose their non-lawyer status to all customers.&quot; After many local bar associations reacted in dismay, &quot;The California Bar then appointed a third group (The Commission on Legal Technicians) to restudy the issue. This commission largely agreed with the conclusions of its predecessors and recommended that non-lawyers be authorized by the California Supreme Court to deliver legal services in several major areas (bankruptcy, family, immigration, and landlord-tenant), under the terms of a licensing scheme that would be supervised by an independent state agency.&quot;

This development culminated in some paralegals being forced to give up the title paralegal for Legal Document Assistant (LDA) in order to administer legal services directly to the public in the allowed areas under California Bus &amp; Prof. Code § 6400. Paralegals who are members of professional associations are also bound by those associations&#x27; codes of ethics many of which include sections prescribing that members not offer legal services directly to the public without the supervision of an attorney or law firm.

<text>Romain Rolland (; 29 January 1866 – 30 December 1944) was a French dramatist, novelist, essayist, art historian and mystic who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1915 &quot;as a tribute to the lofty idealism of his literary production and to the sympathy and love of truth with which he has described different types of human beings&quot;.

He was an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore, wrote a still relevant biography of Gandhi, and is also noted for his correspondence with numerous writers and thinkers across the globe including Maxim Gorki, Rabindranath Tagore and Sigmund Freud.

==Biography==
Rolland was born in Clamecy, Nièvre into a family that had both wealthy townspeople and farmers in its lineage. Writing introspectively in his &quot;Voyage intérieur&quot; (1942), he sees himself as a representative of an &quot;antique species&quot;. He would cast these ancestors in &quot;Colas Breugnon&quot; (1919).

Accepted to the École normale supérieure in 1886, he first studied philosophy, but his independence of spirit led him to abandon that so as not to submit to the dominant ideology. He received his degree in history in 1889 and spent two years in Rome, where his encounter with Malwida von Meysenbug–who had been a friend of Nietzsche and of Wagner–and his discovery of Italian masterpieces were decisive for the development of his thought. When he returned to France in 1895, he received his doctoral degree with his thesis &quot;Les origines du théâtre lyrique moderne. Histoire de l’opéra en Europe avant Lulli et Scarlatti&quot; (&quot;The origins of modern lyric theatre. A History of Opera in Europe before Lully and Scarlatti&quot;). For the next two decades, he taught at various lycées in Paris before directing the newly established music school of the École des Hautes Études Sociales from 1902 to 1911. In 1903 he was appointed to the first chair of music history at the Sorbonne, he also directed briefly in 1911 the musical section at the French Institute in Florence.

His first book was published in 1902 when he was 36 years old. Through his advocacy for a &#x27;people&#x27;s theatre&#x27;, he made a significant contribution towards the democratization of the theatre. As a humanist, he embraced the work of the philosophers of India (&quot;Conversations with Rabindranath Tagore&quot; and Mohandas Gandhi). Rolland was strongly influenced by the Vedanta philosophy of India, primarily through the works of Swami Vivekananda.

A demanding, yet timid, young man, he did not like teaching. He was not indifferent to youth: Jean-Christophe, Olivier and their friends, the heroes of his novels, are young people. But with real-life persons, youths as well as adults, Rolland maintained only a distant relationship. He was first and foremost a writer. Assured that literature would provide him with a modest income, he resigned from the university in 1912. In 1920, Rolland used the phrase, &quot;Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will&quot; in a review, which Antonio Gramsci adopted from him as a formula for intellectual perseverance during hard times.

Romain Rolland was a lifelong pacifist. He was one of the few major French writers to retain his pacifist internationalist values; he moved to Switzerland. He protested against the first World War in &quot;&quot; (1915), &quot;Above the Battle&quot; (Chicago, 1916). In 1924, his book on Gandhi contributed to the Indian nonviolent leader&#x27;s reputation and the two men met in 1931. Rolland was a vegetarian.

In May 1922 he attended the International Congress of Progressive Artists and signed the &quot;Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists&quot;.

In 1928 Rolland and Hungarian scholar, philosopher and natural living experimenter Edmund Bordeaux Szekely founded the International Biogenic Society to promote and expand on their ideas of the integration of mind, body and spirit.
In 1932 Rolland was among the first members of the World Committee Against War and Fascism, organized by Willi Münzenberg. Rolland criticized the control Münzenberg assumed over the committee and was against it being based in Berlin.

Rolland moved to Villeneuve, on the shores of Lake Geneva to devote himself to writing. His life was interrupted by health problems, and by travels to art exhibitions. His visit to Moscow (1935), on the invitation of Maxim Gorky, was an opportunity to meet Joseph Stalin, whom he considered the greatest man of his time. Rolland served unofficially as ambassador of French artists to the Soviet Union. Although he admired Stalin, he attempted to intervene against the persecution of his friends. He attempted to discuss his concerns with Stalin, and was involved in the campaign for the release of the Left Opposition activist and writer Victor Serge and wrote to Stalin begging clemency for Nikolai Bukharin. During Serge&#x27;s imprisonment (1933–1936), Rolland had agreed to handle the publications of Serge&#x27;s writings in France, despite their political disagreements.

In 1937, he came back to live in Vézelay, which, in 1940, was occupied by the Germans. During the occupation, he isolated himself in complete solitude. Never stopping his work, in 1940, he finished his memoirs. He also placed the finishing touches on his musical research on the life of Ludwig van Beethoven. Shortly before his death, he wrote &quot;Péguy&quot; (1944), in which he examines religion and socialism through the context of his memories. He died on 30 December 1944 in Vézelay.

In 1921, his close friend the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig published his biography (in English &quot;Romain Rolland: The Man and His Works&quot;). Zweig profoundly admired Rolland, whom he once described as &quot;the moral consciousness of Europe&quot; during the years of turmoil and War in Europe. Zweig wrote at length about his friendship with Rolland in his own autobiography (in English &quot;The World of Yesterday&quot;), discussing, for example, their failed efforts to organize a conference of antiwar intellectuals from both warring camps in neutral Switzerland.

Victor Serge was appreciative of Rolland&#x27;s interventions on his behalf but ultimately thoroughly disappointed by Rolland&#x27;s refusal to break publicly with Stalin and the repressive Soviet regime. The entry for 4 May 1945, a few weeks after Rolland&#x27;s death, in Serge&#x27;s &quot;Notebooks: 1936-1947&quot; notes acidly that &quot;At age seventy the author of &quot;Jean-Christophe&quot; allowed himself to be covered with the blood spilled by a tyranny of which he was a faithful adulator.&quot; However, this is completely denied by Romain Rolland&#x27;s biographer Bernard Duchatelet in his French biography Romain Rolland: Tel qu&#x27;en lui-même. Duchatelet and other Rollandians believe that Rolland remained faithful to his own well-known integrity.

Rolland&#x27;s life was &#x27;the story of a conscience&#x27;, as mentioned in the title of the book on him by Alex Aronson.

Hermann Hesse dedicated &quot;Siddhartha&quot; to Romain Rolland &quot;my dear friend&quot;.

==People&#x27;s theatre==
Rolland&#x27;s most significant contribution to the theatre lies in his advocacy for a &quot;popular theatre&quot; in his essay &quot;The People&#x27;s Theatre&quot; (&quot;Le Théâtre du peuple&quot;, 1902). &quot;There is only one necessary condition for the emergence of a new theatre&quot;, he wrote, &quot;that the stage and auditorium should be open to the masses, should be able to contain a people and the actions of a people&quot;. The book was not published until 1913, but most of its contents had appeared in the &quot;Revue d&#x27;Art Dramatique&quot; between 1900 and 1903. Rolland attempted to put his theory into practice with his melodramatic dramas about the French Revolution, &quot;Danton&quot; (1900) and &quot;The Fourteenth of July&quot; (1902), but it was his ideas that formed a major reference point for subsequent practitioners.

The essay is part of a more general movement around the turn of that century towards the democratization of the theatre. The &quot;Revue&quot; had held a competition and tried to organize a &quot;World Congress on People&#x27;s Theatre&quot;, and a number of People&#x27;s Theatres had opened across Europe, including the Freie Volksbühne movement (&#x27;Free People&#x27;s Theatre&#x27;) in Germany and Maurice Pottecher&#x27;s Théâtre du Peuple in France. Rolland was a disciple of Pottecher and dedicated &quot;The People&#x27;s Theatre&quot; to him.

Rolland&#x27;s approach is more aggressive, though, than Pottecher&#x27;s poetic vision of theatre as a substitute &#x27;social religion&#x27; bringing unity to the nation. Rolland indicts the bourgeoisie for its appropriation of the theatre, causing it to slide into decadence, and the deleterious effects of its ideological dominance. In proposing a suitable repertoire for his people&#x27;s theatre, Rolland rejects classical drama in the belief that it is either too difficult or too static to be of interest to the masses. Drawing on the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, he proposes instead &quot;an epic historical theatre of &#x27;joy, force and intelligence&#x27; which will remind the people of its revolutionary heritage and revitalize the forces working for a new society&quot; (in the words of Bradby and McCormick, quoting Rolland). Rolland believed that the people would be improved by seeing heroic images of their past. Rousseau&#x27;s influence may be detected in Rolland&#x27;s conception of theatre-as-festivity, an emphasis that reveals a fundamental anti-theatrical prejudice: &quot;Theatre supposes lives that are poor and agitated, a people searching in dreams for a refuge from thought. If we were happier and freer we should not feel hungry for theatre. [...] A people that is happy and free has need of festivities more than of theatres; it will always see in itself the finest spectacle&quot;.

Rolland&#x27;s dramas have been staged by some of the most influential theatre directors of the twentieth century, including Max Reinhardt and Erwin Piscator. Piscator directed the world première of Rolland&#x27;s pacifist drama &quot;The Time Will Come&quot; (&quot;Le Temps viendra&quot;, written in 1903) at Berlin&#x27;s Central-Theater, which opened on 17 November 1922 with music by K Pringsheim and scenic design by O Schmalhausen and M Meier. The play addresses the connections between imperialism and capitalism, the treatment of enemy civilians, and the use of concentration camps, all of which are dramatised via an episode in the Boer War. Piscator described his treatment of the play as &quot;thoroughly naturalistic&quot;, whereby he sought &quot;to achieve the greatest possible realism in acting and decor&quot;. Despite the play&#x27;s overly-rhetorical style, the production was reviewed positively.

==Novels==
Rolland&#x27;s most famous novel is the 10-volume novel sequence &quot;Jean-Christophe&quot; (1904–1912), which brings &quot;together his interests and ideals in the story of a German musical genius who makes France his second home and becomes a vehicle for Rolland&#x27;s views on music, social matters and understanding between nations&quot;. His other novels are &quot;Colas Breugnon&quot; (1919), &quot;Clérambault&quot; (1920), &quot;Pierre et Luce&quot; (1920) and his second roman-fleuve, the 7-volume &quot;L&#x27;âme enchantée&quot; (1922–1933).

== Academic career ==
He became a history teacher at Lycée Henri IV, then at the Lycée Louis le Grand, and a member of the École française de Rome, then a professor of the History of Music at the Sorbonne, and History Professor at the École Normale Supérieure.

==Correspondence with Richard Strauss==
In 1899 Rolland started what became a voluminous correspondence with the German composer Richard Strauss (the English translation, edited by Rollo Myers, runs to 239 pages, including some diary entries). At the time, Strauss was a celebrated conductor of works by Wagner, Liszt, Mozart, and of his own tone poems. In 1905, Strauss completed his opera &quot;Salome&quot;, based on the verse play by Oscar Wilde, originally written in French. Strauss based his version of &quot;Salome&quot; on Hedwig Lachmann&#x27;s German translation which he had seen performed in Berlin in 1902. Out of respect for Wilde, Strauss wanted to create a parallel French version, to be as close as possible to Wilde&#x27;s original text, and he wrote to Rolland requesting his help on this project.

Rolland was initially reluctant, but a lengthy exchange ensued, occupying 50 pages of the Myers edition, and in the end Rolland made 191 suggestions for improving the Strauss/Wilde libretto. The resulting French version of &quot;Salome&quot; received its first performance in Paris in 1907, two years after the German premiere. Thereafter, Rolland&#x27;s letters regularly discussed Strauss&#x27;s operas, including the occasional criticism of Strauss&#x27;s librettist, Hugo von Hoffmannsthal: &quot;I only regret that the great writer who gives you such brilliant libretti too often lacks a sense of the theatre.&quot;

Rolland was a pacifist and concurred with Strauss when the latter refused to sign the Manifesto of German artists and intellectuals supporting the German role in World War I. Rolland noted Strauss&#x27;s response in his diary entry for October 1914: &quot;Declarations about war and politics are not fitting for an artist, who must give his attention to his creations and his works.&quot;(&quot;Myers p. 160&quot;)

==Correspondence with Freud==
1923 saw the beginning of a correspondence between psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and Rolland, who found that the admiration that he showed for Freud was reciprocated in equal measures (Freud proclaiming in a letter to him: &quot;That I have been allowed to exchange a greeting with you will remain a happy memory to the end of my days.&quot;). This correspondence introduced Freud to the concept of the &quot;oceanic feeling&quot; that Rolland had developed through his study of Eastern mysticism. Freud opened his next book &quot;Civilization and its Discontents&quot; (1929) with a debate on the nature of this feeling, which he mentioned had been noted to him by an anonymous &quot;friend&quot;. This friend was Rolland. Rolland would remain a major influence on Freud&#x27;s work, continuing their correspondence right up to Freud&#x27;s death in 1939.

<text>The viviparous eelpout (&quot;Zoarces viviparus&quot;), also known as the, viviparous blenny and European eelpout is species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Zoarcidae, the eelpouts. It is notable for being ovoviviparous and gives birth to live larvae (hence the description &quot;mother of eels&quot;). It is a common soup ingredient in Mediterranean countries. The bones are of greenish colour, due to a harmless pigment. Their skin is slimy and the colour is variable.

==Taxonomy==
The viviparous eelpout was first formally described as &quot;Blennius viviparus&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; with its type locality given as &quot;European seas&quot;. In 1829, the French zoologist Georges Cuvier proposed the genus &quot;Zoarces&quot; for the eelpouts and subsequently &quot;B, viviparus&quot; was descignated as the type species of &quot;Zoarces&quot;, possibly by David Starr Jordan in 1917/ The specific name &quot;viviparus&quot; means &quot;giving birth to live young&quot;, although the species is ovoviviparous.

==Description==
The viviparous eelpout has a slim, tapering body and resembles a small burbot (&quot;Lota lota&quot;), a wide head and mouth and protuberant lips. It has long, ribbon-like dorsal and anal fins which continue on to unite with the arrowhead-shaped caudal fin. This distinguishes this fish from the two similar slim-bodied bottom-dwelling fish of the area, the rock gunnel (&quot;Pholis gunnellus&quot;) and the snake blenny (&quot;Ophidion barbatum&quot;). The bones are green. The tiny scales are embedded in the slimy skin. There dorsal fin becomes lower as it nears the caudal fin with these shorter rays being short and spinous. The colour is highly variable, although they are commonly greyish brown on the upper body and yellowish ventrally. They are marked with eithaer a single or double series of blotches along the body and on the dorsal fin. The pectoral fins have yellow or yellowish orange edges. This species reaches a maximum published total length of , although is more typical, and may weigh up to .

==Distribution and habitat==
The viviparous eelpoutis found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean where its range extends from the English Channel north around the British Isles, although it is absent from the Atlantic coasts of Ireland, eastwards onto the Baltic Sea and northwards through the North Sea and along the coast of Norway to the White Sea and the Barents Sea. This species occurs in the intertidal zone where it can live in marine and brackish environments, avoiding drying out when exposed at low tide by sheltering beneath rocks or in fissures in the rock or by staying submerged in rock pools. This demersal fish is normally sedentary, hiding under rocks or among seaweed. Its can be found at depsth between , although it is normally found at depths of . 
==Biology==
The viviparous eelpout feeds on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as crustaceans, and fish eggs and fry.

Adults mate during the months of August and September using internal fertilisation. The fish are notably viviparous, giving birth to 30–400 live developed young. Unusually, it does so during winter when water temperatures are extremely cold. Among fish it has one of the longest known pregnancies, lasting approximately six months. It has been discovered that the eelpout suckles its young embryos while still within their mother&#x27;s body, making it the only fish species to suckle its offspring. The embryos actually suckle from ovarian follicles, ingesting nutrients and gases from these internal structures. After depleting the egg&#x27;s yolk reserves, the eelpouts attach their mouths to an ovarian follicle, which has a canal in its tip via which fluid and nutrients can flow. This follicle fluid is rich in proteins, fatty acids and glucose. It is also saturated in oxygen, which helps ventilate the gills of the developing fish. Each embryo latches onto a single follicle. This ensures an equal distribution of nutrients.

==Utilisation==
The viviparous eelpout is of minor commercial value to fisheries in some parts of its range.

<text>Titus Labienus (17 March 45 BC) was a high-ranking military officer in the late Roman Republic. He served as tribune of the Plebs in 63 BC. Although mostly remembered as one of Julius Caesar&#x27;s best lieutenants in Gaul and mentioned frequently in the accounts of his military campaigns, Labienus chose to oppose him during the Civil War and was killed at Munda. He was the father of Quintus Labienus.

==Biography==

===Early career===
As his praetorship was in 60 or 59 BC, Titus Labienus most likely was born around 100 BC. Many sources suggest that he came from the town of Cingulum in Picenum. His family was of equestrian status. He most likely had early ties with Pompey during his time as a patron for Picenum and his desire to rise in military rank. His early service was c. 78–75 BC in Cilicia under Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus fighting pirates and the Isaurian hill tribes.

===Tribune of the Plebs, Trial of Gaius Rabirius===
In 63 BC, Titus Labienus was a tribune of the Plebs with close ties to Pompey. Gaius Julius Caesar was also working closely with Pompey and therefore he and Labienus occasionally cooperated. These interactions were the seed that eventually developed into a friendship between Labienus and Caesar.

At Caesar&#x27;s instigation, Labienus accused Gaius Rabirius of high treason (perduellio) for the murder of the tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus and of his uncle Titus Labienus in 100 BC. The purpose of this trial was to discredit the so-called &quot;final decree of the Senate&quot; (senatus consultum ultimum), an emergency measure of the senate commonly used against the Populares and the Roman assemblies. Labienus used the antiquated procedure of the duumviri, used in the early republic, against Rabirius. The procedure bypassed normal criminal law and Rabirius would be tried without defense. Since tribunes were sacrosanct, it was seen as an act against the gods to kill one. Thus punishment of the culprit was seen as more of a cleansing to appease the gods. The killing was seen as a pollution so profound that a normal criminal trial was unnecessary and immediate cleansing was necessary to avoid the wrath of the gods. The duumviri were assigned to accuse under the pretense of obvious guilt and cleanse the culprit through scourging.

Rabirius appealed to the Centuriate Assembly and Cicero spoke in his defense. However, before the assembly could vote, Metellus Celer used his powers as an augur to claim the sightings of bad omens and take down the flag in Janiculum. That postponed the trial. Rabirius was ultimately sentenced to exile, as he was unable to pay an unreasonable fine.

In the same year, Labienus carried a plebiscite returning the elections of the pontifices to the people. That indirectly secured for Caesar the dignity of pontifex Maximus, by his act of supporting Labienus in this cause (Dio Cassius xxxvii. 37).

Labienus was more a soldier than politician and primarily used his office as a gateway to secure himself positions of high military command. After his term as tribune, Labienus served as Caesar&#x27;s legate (second-in-command) in Gaul and so he took Caesar&#x27;s place whenever he was out of Gaul.

===Lieutenant under Caesar in Gaul===
As Caesar&#x27;s senior legate during his campaign in Gaul, Labienus was the only legate mentioned by name in Caesar&#x27;s writings about his first campaign. He was a skilled cavalry commander.

Labienus commanded the winter quarters in Vesontio in 58 BC. He also had full command of the legions in Gaul during Caesar&#x27;s absence, as his &quot;legatus pro praetore&quot;. He had this privilege when Caesar was administering justice in Cisalpine Gaul as well as during Caesar&#x27;s second campaign in Britain (in 54 BC).

In 57 BC, during the Belgian campaign, in a battle against the Atrebates and Nervii near Sabis, Labienus, commanding the 9th and 10th legions, defeated the opposing Atrebates force and proceeded to take the enemy camp. From there he sent the 10th Legion against the rear of the Nervii line while they were engaged with the rest of Caesar&#x27;s army, single-handedly turning the tide of battle and securing Caesar the victory.

Labienus is also credited with the defeat of the Treviri under Indutiomarus. Labienus spent days with his army fortified in their camp, while Indutiomarus harassed him daily in an attempt at intimidation and demoralization. Labienus waited for the right moment, when Indutiomarus and his forces were returning to their camp disorganized, to send out his cavalry through two gates. He gave them the orders to first kill Indutiomarus, then his trailing forces on their return. Labienus&#x27;s men were successful, and with the death of their leader, the Treviri army scattered. The Treviri forces later regrouped under relatives of Indutiomarus and moved upon Labienus, setting up camp across the river from his legions, waiting for reinforcements from the Germans. Labienus feigned a withdrawal, enticing the Treviri to cross the river, after which he turned around and had his men attack. Being in such a disadvantageous position, the Treviri forces were shattered. After hearing this, the German reinforcements turned around.

Labienus&#x27;s victory over the Parisii at Lutetia in the Battle of Lutetia is another example of his tactical genius. Sending five cohorts back towards Agedincum, and himself crossing the Sequana River with three legions, he tricked the enemy into thinking that he had divided his army and was crossing the river in three places. The enemy army split into thirds and pursued Labienus. The main body met Labienus which he subsequently surrounded with the rest of his legions. He then annihilated the reinforcements with his cavalry.

In September, 51 BC, Caesar made Labienus governor of Cisalpine Gaul.

===Defection from Caesar, command under Pompey in Civil War===
After Caesar crossed the Rubicon, Labienus left his post in Cisalpine Gaul and joined Pompey. He was rapturously welcomed on the Pompeian side, bringing some Gallic and German cavalry with him. He also brought an account on Caesar&#x27;s military strength.

Pompey made Labienus commander of the cavalry (magister equitum). Labienus attempted to persuade Pompey to face Caesar in Italy and not retreat to Hispania (Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal) to regroup, insisting that Caesar&#x27;s army was thin and weakened after his campaign in Gaul.

But Labienus&#x27;s ill fortune under Pompey was as marked as his success had been under Caesar. From the defeat at the Battle of Pharsalus, where he commanded the cavalry, he fled to Corcyra, and after hearing of the death of Pompey then proceeded to Africa. He created confidence in the followers of Pompey by lying to them, claiming that Caesar had received a mortal wound at the Battle of Pharsalus. He was able through sheer force of numbers to inflict a slight check upon Caesar at the Battle of Ruspina in 46 BC. By arranging his troops into dense formations, he tricked Caesar into thinking he had only foot soldiers, and was able to rout Caesar&#x27;s cavalry and surround his army. However, Labienus was unable to defeat Caesar&#x27;s forces, and was compelled to leave the field. After the defeat at the Battle of Thapsus, he joined the younger Gnaeus Pompeius in Hispania.

Death came to Labienus in the Battle of Munda, an evenly matched conflict between the armies of Caesar and the sons of Pompey. King Bogud, an ally of Caesar, approached the Pompeians with his army from the rear. Labienus was commanding the Pompeians&#x27; cavalry unit at the time, and seeing this, took the cavalry from the front lines to meet him. The Pompeian legions misinterpreted this as a retreat, became disheartened and began to break. Pompeians suffered massive casualties during the rout, in which Labenius himself was killed. This defeat ended Caesar&#x27;s Civil War. According to Appian, (BC2.105), his head was brought to Caesar, who then dispatched men to locate the body of his old friend, and buried him with full honours.

== Fictional accounts ==
* Labienus is featured in &quot;The Gods of War&quot;, a novel by British author Conn Iggulden, though in a much reduced role, as his historical position as Caesar&#x27;s second-in-command is filled instead by Marcus Junius Brutus, whose relationship with Caesar is conversely greatly expanded. 
* Labienus was an important minor character in the earlier &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; novels by Australian author Colleen McCullough. In these, his first appearance is in the Trial of Rabirius, but this is placed rather later in the political year than it is usually stated as having been, orchestrated by Caesar as a reaction to Cicero&#x27;s decision to have several Catiline conspirators executed without trial while the &quot;Senatus Consultum Ultimum&quot; is in force – rather than as a prior warning against such an action before the decree was even in place. He then falls on hard times because he had drawn the disfavour of Pompey for having an affair with his wife Mucia Tertia, the daughter of Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex, the pontifex maximus and consul in 95 BC, and thus a member of Rome&#x27;s nobility that he moved to his vast estates in Picenum. He is portrayed latterly as a very capable but fierce and cruel soldier and commander, whose brilliance wins battles in Gaul, but whose brutality went some way towards alienating Caesar&#x27;s Gallic allies and thus causing the battles in the first place. McCullough takes a somewhat different interpretation of the events, and has Caesar shunning Labienus, instead of Labienus defecting to Pompey. In the novels, Caesar disowns Labienus when it comes to civil war, not wanting him on his side because he is too cruel and unpredictable.
* Labienus was also featured in the BBC One docudrama &quot;Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire&quot;.
* Labienus is a significant character in S.J.A. Turney&#x27;s series &quot;Marius&#x27; Mules&quot;.
* Labienus features in the campaign of the video game &quot;Praetorians&quot;. He is a playable character in several missions set in the Gallic Wars to finally re-emerge as the main antagonist in the last mission set at the end of the Civil War. In the game&#x27;s version of events, Labienus did not die in the Battle of Munda, but has managed to flee to the Pompeian encampment where he makes his final stand.
* In the 2021 series &quot;Dogmatix and the Indomatibles&quot;, based on the world-famous &quot;Asterix&quot; comics, Labienus is featured as the accomplished conquerer and de facto ruler of Lutetia, now known as Paris, in 52 B.C., similar to his real-life counterpart. In the show, Labienus owns a siamese cat named Monalisa, whom Dogmatix opposes.

<text>Impalement, as a method of torture and execution, is the penetration of a human by an object such as a stake, pole, spear, or hook, often by the complete or partial perforation of the torso. It was particularly used in response to &quot;crimes against the state&quot; and is regarded across a number of cultures as a very harsh form of capital punishment and recorded in myth and art. Impalement was also used during times of war to suppress rebellions, punish traitors or collaborators, and punish breaches of military discipline.

Offences where impalement was occasionally employed included contempt for the state&#x27;s responsibility for safe roads and trade routes by committing highway robbery or grave robbery, violating state policies or monopolies, or subverting standards for trade. Offenders have also been impaled for a variety of cultural, sexual, and religious reasons.

References to impalement in Babylonia and the Neo-Assyrian Empire are found as early as the 18th century BC.

==Methods==

===Longitudinal impalement===
Impaling an individual along the body length has been documented in several cases, and the merchant Jean de Thevenot provides an eyewitness account of this from 17th-century Egypt, in the case of a man condemned to death for the use of false weights: 
====Survival time====
The length of time which one managed to survive upon the stake is reported as quite varied, from a few seconds or minutes to a few hours or even a few days. The Dutch overlords at Batavia seem to have been particularly proficient in prolonging the lifetime of the impaled, one witnessing a man surviving six days on the stake, another hearing from local surgeons that some could survive eight days or more. A critical determinant for survival length seems to be precisely &quot;how&quot; the stake was inserted: If it went into the &quot;interior&quot; parts, vital organs could easily be damaged, leading to a swift death. However, by letting the stake follow the spine, the impalement procedure would not damage the vital organs, and the person could survive for several days.

Weather and seasons also affected duration of life after impalement. One example given of weather affecting death is noted by Stavorinus. A man was impaled following the spine. A light shower fell the next day. He died half an hour later. Stavorinus also mentions there having been instances of impalement during the dry season, in which people have survived for eight days or more with out food or drink. A guard would be stationed near the site of execution to prevent food or drink to be given. A surgeon also explained to Stavorinus, how rain and other wet weather caused a quicker death. Water enters the wound caused by impalement. The wound then &quot;mortifies&quot; and causes gangrene to attack more &quot;noble parts,&quot; causing &quot;death almost immediately.&quot;

===Transversal impalement===
Alternatively, the impalement could be transversely performed, as in the frontal-to-dorsal direction, that is, from front (through abdomen, chest or directly through the heart) to back or &quot;vice versa&quot;.

In the Holy Roman Empire (and elsewhere in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn babies were placed in open graves, and stakes were hammered into their hearts, particularly if their cases contained any implications of witchcraft. A detailed description of an execution that was carried out in this manner comes from 17th-century Kassa, Hungary (now Košice, eastern Slovakia). The case of a woman who was to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was then placed within it, her hands and feet were secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave on her heart in order to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth at the behest of the clerics, because to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner used a pair of tongs to grab a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman&#x27;s head. It is said that a scream was heard, and the earth moved upwards for a moment, before it was all over.

===Variations===

====Gaunching====
Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, travelling on botanical research in the Levant 1700–1702, observed both ordinary longitudinal impalement, but also a method called &quot;gaunching&quot;, in which the condemned is hoisted up by means of a rope over a row of sharp metal hooks. He is then released, and depending on how the hooks enter his body, he may survive in impaled condition for a few days.
Forty years earlier than de Tournefort, de Thévenot described much the same process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel. Some 80 years prior to de Thevenot, in 1579, Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed a variant of the gaunching ritual. A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross-bar of the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his back, so that he hung from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the cross bar, the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.

====Hooks in the city wall====
While gaunching as de Tournefort describes involves the erection of a scaffold, it seems that in the city of Algiers, hooks were embedded in the city walls, and on occasion, people were thrown upon them from the battlements.

Thomas Shaw, who was chaplain for the Levant Company stationed at Algiers during the 1720s, describes the various forms of executions practised as follows:

According to one source, these hooks in the wall as an execution method were introduced with the construction of the new city gate in 1573. Before that time, gaunching as described by de Tournefort was in use. As for the actual &quot;frequency&quot; of throwing persons on hooks in Algiers, Capt. Henry Boyde notes that in his own 20 years of captivity there, he knew of only one case where a Christian slave who had murdered his master had met that fate, and &quot;not above&quot; two or three Moors besides. Taken captive in 1596, the barber-surgeon William Davies relates something of the heights involved when thrown upon hooks (although it is somewhat unclear if this relates specifically to the city of Algiers, or elsewhere in the Barbary States): &quot;Their ganshing is after this manner: he sitteth upon a wall, being five fathoms [30 feet, or about 9m] high, within two fathoms [12 feet or about 3.6m] of the top of the wall; right under the place where he sits, is a strong iron hook fastened, being very sharp; then he is thrust off the wall upon this hook, with some part of his body, and there he hangeth, sometimes two or three days, before he dieth.&quot; Davies adds that &quot;these deaths are very seldom&quot;, but that he had personally witnessed it.

====Hanged by the ribs====
A slightly variant way of executing people by means of impalement was to force an iron meat hook beneath a person&#x27;s ribs and hang him up to die slowly. This technique was in 18th-century Ottoman-controlled Bosnia called the &quot;cengela&quot;, but the practice is also attested in 1770s Dutch Suriname as a punishment meted out to rebellious slaves.

====Bamboo Torture====

A recurring horror story on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim&#x27;s body, eventually emerging through the other side. However, no conclusive evidence exists that this form of impalement ever actually happened.

==History==

===Antiquity===

====Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East====

The earliest known use of impalement as a form of execution occurred in civilizations of the ancient Near East. The Code of Hammurabi, promulgated about 1772 BC by the Babylonian king Hammurabi specifies impaling for a woman who killed her husband for the sake of another man. In the late Isin/Larsa period, from about the same time, it seems that, in some city states, mere adultery on the wife&#x27;s part (without murder of her husband mentioned) could be punished by impalement. From the royal archives of the city of Mari, most of it also roughly contemporary to Hammurabi, it is known that soldiers taken captive in war were on occasion impaled. Roughly contemporary with Babylonia under Hammurabi, king Siwe-Palar-huhpak of Elam made official edicts in which he threatened the allies of his enemies with impalement, among other terrible fates. For acts of perceived great sacrilege, some individuals, in diverse cultures, have been impaled for their effrontery. For example, roughly 1200 BC, merchants of Ugarit express deep concern to each other that a fellow citizen is to be impaled in the Phoenician town Sidon, due to some &quot;great sin&quot; committed against the patron deity of Sidon.

====Pharaonic Egypt====
During Dynasty 19, Merneptah had Libu prisoners of war impaled (&quot;caused to be set upon a stake&quot;) to the south of Memphis, following an attempted invasion of Egypt during his Regnal Year 5. The relevant determinative for &quot;ḫt&quot; (&quot;stake&quot;) depicts an individual transfixed through the abdomen. Other Egyptian kings employing impalements include Sobekhotep II, Akhenaten, Seti, and Ramesses IX.

====Neo-Assyrian Empire====

Evidence by carvings and statues is found as well from the Neo-Assyrian empire (c. 934–609 BC). The image of the impaled Judeans is a detail from the public commemoration of the Assyrian victory in 701 BC after the siege of Lachish, under King Sennacherib (r. 705–681 BC), who proceeded similarly against the inhabitants of Ekron during the same campaign. From Sennacherib&#x27;s father Sargon II&#x27;s time (r. 722–705 BC), a relief from his palace at Khorsabad shows the impalement of 14 enemies during an attack on the city of Pazashi. A peculiarity about the &quot;Neo-Assyrian&quot; way of impaling was that the stake was &quot;driven into the body immediately under the ribs&quot;, rather than along the full body length. For the Neo-Assyrians, mass executions seem to have been not only designed to instill terror and to enforce obedience, but also, it can seem, as proofs of their &quot;might&quot; that they took pride in. Neo-Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC) was evidently proud enough of his bloody work that he committed it to monument and eternal memory as follows:

Paul Kern, in his (1999) &quot;Ancient Siege Warfare&quot;, provides some statistics on how different Neo-Assyrian kings from the times of Ashurnasirpal II commemorated their punishments of rebels.

Although impalement of rebels and enemies is particularly well-attested from Neo-Assyrian times, the 14th-century BC Mitanni king Shattiwaza charges his predecessor, the usurper Shuttarna III for having delivered unto the (Middle) Assyrians several nobles, who had them promptly impaled. Some scholars have said, though, that it is only with King Ashur-bel-kala (r. 1074–1056) that there is solid evidence that punishments like flaying and impaling came into use. From the Middle Assyrian period, there is evidence about impalement as a form of punishment relative to other types of perceived crimes as well. The law code discovered and deciphered by Otto Schroeder contains in its paragraph 51 the following injunction against abortion:

====Achaemenid Persia====

The Greek historian Herodotus recounts that, when Darius I, king of Persia, conquered Babylon, he impaled 3000 Babylonians. In the Behistun Inscription, Darius himself boasts of having impaled his enemies. Darius speaks proudly of the ruthlessness with which these revolts were put down. In Babylon Nidintu-Bel was impaled along with 49 of his companions:


In 522 BC Phraortes proclaimed that he was a descendant of the Median king Cyaxares and took the throne, he seized Ecbatana, the capital of Media and rebelled against the Achamenied yoke, this revolt was suppressed by Darius king of Persia and Phraortes was captured and impaled:

====Biblical evidence====
A Bible passage in the Book of Esther concerning the fate of the 5th-century BC Persian minister Haman and his ten sons has been treated differently by different translators, leading to an ambiguity as to whether they were impaled or hanged. The passage explains that Haman conspired to have all the Jews in the empire killed but his plan was thwarted, and he was given the punishment he had thought to mete out to Mordecai. The English Standard Version of Esther 5:14 describes this as &quot;hanging&quot;, whereas The New International Reader&#x27;s version opts for &quot;impalement&quot;.
The Assyriologist Paul Haupt opts for impalement in his 1908 essay &quot;Critical notes on Esther&quot;, while Benjamin Shaw has an extended discussion of the topic on the website ligonier.org from 2012.

Other passages in the Bible may allude to the practice of impalement, such as II Samuel 21:9 concerning the fate of the sons of Saul, where some English translations use the verb &quot;impale&quot;, but others use &quot;hang&quot;.

Although we lack conclusive evidence either way for whether Hebrew law allowed for impalement, or for hanging (whether as a mode of execution or for display of the corpse), the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement as seen in carvings could, perhaps, equally easily be seen as a form of &quot;hanging&quot; upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake&#x27;s actual &quot;penetration&quot; of the body.

====Rome====

From John Granger Cook, 2014: &quot;&quot;Stipes&quot; is Seneca&#x27;s term for the object used for impalement. This narrative and his &quot;Ep&quot;. 14.5 are the only two textually explicit references to impalement in Latin texts:&quot;

===Europe===

====Transversal impalement====
Within the Holy Roman Empire, in article 131 of the 1532 Constitutio Criminalis Carolina, the following punishment was stated for women found guilty of infanticide. Generally, they should be drowned, but the law code allowed for, in particularly severe cases, that the old punishment could be implemented. That is, the woman would be buried alive, and then a stake would be driven through her heart. Similarly, burial alive, combined with transversal impalement is attested as an early execution method for people found guilty of adultery. The 1348 statutes of Zwickau allowed punishment of an adulterous couple in the following way: They were to be placed on top of each other in a grave, with a layer of thorns between them. Then, a single stake was to be hammered through them. A similar punishment by impalement for a proven male adulterer is mentioned in a 13th-century ordinance for Moravian mining city Jihlava (then and German Iglau), whereas in a 1340 Vienna statute, the husband of a woman caught &quot;in flagrante&quot; in adultery could, if he wished to, demand that his wife and her lover be impaled, or alternatively demand a monetary restitution. Occasionally, women found guilty of witchcraft have been condemned to be impaled. In 1587 Kiel, 101-year-old Sunde Bohlen was, on being condemned as a witch, buried alive, and afterwards had a stake driven through her heart.

Rapists of virgins and children are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through them. In one such judicial tradition, the rapist was to be placed in an open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure. Serving as an example of the fate of a child molester, in August 1465 in Zurich, Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine. His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His arms and legs were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, people left him to die.

====Longitudinal impalement====
Cases of &quot;longitudinal&quot; impalement typically occur in the context of war or as a punishment for robbery, the latter being attested to as the practice in Central and Eastern Europe. During the Defenestration of Prague in 1419, the Hussites impaled councilors to the king on pikes.

Individuals accused of collaborating with the enemy have, on occasion, been impaled. In 1632 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the German officer Fuchs was impaled on suspicion of defecting to the Swedes, a Swedish corporal was likewise impaled for trying to defect to the Germans. The Swedes continued this practise during the Scanian War (1675-1679), especially in the case of deserters and those perceived as traitors. In 1654, under the Ottoman siege of the Venetian garrison at Crete, several peasants were impaled for supplying provisions to the besieged. Likewise in 1685, some Christians were impaled by the Hungarians for having provided supplies to the Turks.

In 1677, a particularly brutal German General Kops leading the forces of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I who wanted to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans, rather than allow it to become dominated by the Turks, began impaling and quartering his Hungarian subjects/opponents. An opposing general on the Hungarian side, , responded in kind, by flaying alive Imperial troops, and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls, upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled. Finally, Emperor Leopold I had enough of the mutual bloodshed, and banished Kops in order to establish a needed cessation of hostilities. After the Treaty of The Hague (1720), Sicily fell under Habsburg rule, but the locals deeply resented the German overlords. One parish priest (who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans) is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village, exclaiming that a whole eight days had gone by since he had last killed a German, and shot the soldier off his horse. The priest was later impaled. In the short-lived 1784 Horea Revolt against the Austrians and Hungarians, the rebels gained hold of two officers, whom they promptly impaled. On their side, the imperial troops got hold of Horea&#x27;s 13-year-old son, and impaled him. That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader&#x27;s determination, although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards. After the revolt was crushed by early 1785, some 150 rebels are said to have been impaled.

From 1748 onwards, German regiments organized manhunts on &quot;robbers&quot; in Hungary/Croatia, impaling those who were caught.

==== Heinous murderers ====
Occasionally, individual murderers were perceived to have been so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or being broken on the wheel were regarded as incommensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. An example is that of Pavel Vašanský (Paul Waschansky in German transcript), who was executed on 1 March 1570 in Ivančice in present-day Czech Republic, on account of 124 confessed murders (he was a roaming highwayman). He underwent a particularly gruelling execution procedure: first, his limbs were cut off and his nipples were ripped off with glowing pincers; he was then flayed, impaled and finally roasted alive. A pamphlet that purports to give Wasansky&#x27;s verbatim confession, does not record how he was apprehended, nor what means of torture was used to extract his confessions.

Other such accounts of &quot;heinous murderers&quot; in which impalement is a prominent element include cases in 1504 and 1519, the murderer nicknamed Puschpeter executed in 1575 for killing thirty people, including six pregnant women whose unborn children he ate in the hope of thereby acquiring invisibility, the head of the Pappenheimer family in 1600, and an unnamed murderer executed in Breslau in 1615, who under torture had confessed to 96 acts of murder by arson.

====Vlad the Impaler====
During the 15th century, Vlad III (&quot;Dracula&quot;), Prince of Wallachia, is credited as the first notable figure to prefer this method of execution during the late medieval period, and became so notorious for its liberal employment that among his several nicknames he was known as &quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot;. After being orphaned, betrayed, forced into exile and pursued by his enemies, he retook control of Wallachia in 1456. He dealt harshly with his enemies, especially those who had betrayed his family in the past, or had profited from the misfortunes of Wallachia. Though a variety of methods were employed, he has been most associated with his use of impalement. The liberal use of capital punishment was eventually extended to Saxon settlers, members of a rival clan, and criminals in his domain, whether they were members of the boyar nobility or peasants, and eventually to any among his subjects that displeased him. Following the multiple campaigns against the invading Ottoman Turks, Vlad would never show mercy to his prisoners of war. After The Night Attack of Vlad Țepeș in mid-June 1462 failed to assassinate the Ottoman sultan, the road to Târgoviște, the capital of Vlad&#x27;s principality of Wallachia, eventually became inundated in a &quot;forest&quot; of 20,000 impaled and decaying corpses, and it is reported that Mehmet II&#x27;s invading army of Turks turned back to Constantinople in 1462 after encountering thousands of impaled corpses along the Danube River. Woodblock prints from the era portray his victims impaled from either the frontal or the dorsal or the rectal impalement method which consisted of a wood or metal pole being inserted through the body either front to back, or vertically, through the rectum or vagina. The exit wound could be near the victim&#x27;s neck, shoulders or mouth.

====Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth====
The impalement was practiced on the south-eastern borders of the Republic of Poland. The punishment was applied to peasants who rebelled against their lords, but also to the nobility. Ukraine was the scene of many Cossack uprisings (for example that of Severyn Nalyvaiko) crushed by the Poles. They most often expressed discontent of a social nature (cf. social revolt of the &quot;Haïdamaks&quot;) such as the subjugation of the free Ukrainian peasants to the Polish lords who had carved out large estates for themselves. The most important uprising was that of Bohdan Chmielnicki-Khmelnitsky. The hatred of the Poles and the Jews was at the origin of the pogroms perpetrated during crossings of Cossack armies. The echoes of this disaster reached, through Jewish traders, Western Europe and are still present in Hasidic songs. We know the story of the small army of the great lord of Volhynia, &quot;kniaz&quot; (Prince) Jeremi Wiśniowiecki who, penetrating from the north, momentarily repelled the armies of Bohdan Khmelnytsky and enabled the numerous Jews to be saved. The prince, a poor strategist, as Paweł Jasienica writes, following the opinion of his contemporaries, made himself known for his cruelty towards the rebellious peasants, taken prisoner (beheadings, hangings and impalements in the squares of towns and villages) but it was only the answer to the exactions committed on the noble prisoners by the Cossack chief Maksym Kryvonis (Nez Crooked).
Aleksander Kostka-Napierski, the leader of the peasant uprising in Podhale, was impaled on a stake in 1651.

Colonel and ataman Sukharuka, a Cossack envoy in the novel and film &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot;, and Donets, a Cossack colonel, Horpyna&#x27;s brother, were sentenced to this penalty. This also happened to the Cossack bandurist Taras Weresaj, the hero of Jacek Komuda&#x27;s novel &quot;Bohun&quot;.

One of the most famous Polish films where the execution of this punishment can be seen is the film &quot;Pan Wołodyjowski&quot; (and the TV series &quot;Przygody pana Michała, Mr Michael&#x27;s adventures&quot;), whose script was based on the &quot;Trilogy&quot; by Henryk Sienkiewicz. Azja Tuhaj-bejowicz was subjected to this punishment for betraying the Commonwealth in Pan Wołodyjowski. The method of execution in Mr. Wołodyjowski was different from the description of Jędrzej Kitowicz; the convict was strung on his back, not on his stomach (as in Jędrzej Kitowicz).

===Ottoman Empire===
Longitudinal impalement is an execution method often attested within the Ottoman Empire, for a variety of offenses, it was done mostly as a warning to others or to terrify.

====Siege of Constantinople====
The Ottoman Empire used impalement during, and before, the last siege of Constantinople in 1453. During the buildup phase to the great siege the year before, in 1452, the sultan declared that all ships sailing up or down through the Bosphorus had to anchor at his fortress there, for inspection. One Venetian captain, Antonio Rizzo, sought to defy the ban, but his ship was hit by a cannonball. He and his crew were picked up from the waters, the crew members to be beheaded (or sawn asunder according to Niccolò Barbaro), whereas Rizzo was impaled. In the early days of the siege in May 1453, contingents of the Ottoman army made mop-up operations at minor fortifications like Therapia and Studium. The surrendered soldiers, some 40 individuals from each place, were impaled.

====Civil crimes====
Within the Ottoman Empire, some civil crimes (rather than rebel activity/treasonous behavior), such as highway robbery, might be punished by impalement. For some periods at least, executions for civil crimes were claimed to have been rather rare in the Ottoman Empire. Aubry de La Motraye lived in the realm for 14 years from 1699 to 1713 and claimed that he had not heard of twenty thieves in Constantinople during that time. As for highway robbers, who surely had been impaled, Aubry heard of only 6 such cases during his residence there. Staying at Aleppo from 1740 to 1754, Alexander Russell notes that in the 20 years gone by, there were no more than &quot;half a dozen&quot; public executions there. Jean de Thévenot, traveling in the Ottoman Empire and its territories like Egypt in the late 1650s, emphasizes the &quot;regional&quot; variations in impalement frequency. Of Constantinople and Turkey, de Thévenot writes that impalement was &quot;not much practised&quot; and &quot;very rarely put in practice.&quot; An exception he highlighted was the situation of Christians in Constantinople. If a Christian spoke or acted out against the &quot;Law of Mahomet&quot;, or consorted with a Turkish woman, or broke into a mosque, then he might face impalement unless he converted to Islam. In contrast, de Thévenot says that in Egypt impalement was a &quot;very ordinary punishment&quot; against the Arabs there, whereas Turks in Egypt were strangled in prison instead of being publicly executed like the natives. Thus, the actual frequency of impalement within the Ottoman Empire varied greatly, not only from time to time, but also from place to place, and between different population groups in the empire.

Highway robbers were still impaled into the 1830s, but one source says the practice was rare by then. Travelling to Smyrna and Constantinople in 1843, Stephen Massett was told by a man who witnessed the event that &quot;just a few years ago&quot;, a dozen or so robbers were impaled at Adrianople. All of them, however, had been strangled prior to impalement. Writing around 1850, the archaeologist Austen Henry Layard mentions that the latest case he was acquainted with happened &quot;about ten years ago&quot; in Baghdad, on four rebel Arab sheikhs.

Impalement of &quot;pirates&quot;, rather than highway robbers, is also occasionally recorded. In October 1767 Hassan Bey, who had preyed on Turkish ships in the Euxine Sea for a number of years, was captured and impaled, even though he had offered 500,000 ducats for his pardon.

====Klephts and rebels in Greece====
During the Ottoman rule of Greece, impalement became an important tool of psychological warfare, intended to inflict terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents (known as &quot;klephts&quot;) became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities. The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806, and were able to enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid the stake, in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen.

Impalement was, on occasion, aggravated with being set over a fire, the impaling stake acting as a spit, so that the impaled victim might be roasted alive. Among other severities, Ali Pasha, an Albanian-born Ottoman noble who ruled Ioannina, had rebels, criminals, and even the descendants of those who had wronged him or his family in the past, impaled and roasted alive. Thomas Smart Hughes, visiting Greece and Albania in 1812–13, says the following about his stay in Ioannina:

During the Greek War of Independence (1821–1832), Greek revolutionaries and civilians were tortured and executed by impalement. A German witness of the Constantinople massacre (April 1821) narrates the impalement of about 65 Greeks by a Turkish mob. In April 1821, thirty Greeks from the Ionian island of Zante (Zakynthos) had been impaled in Patras. This was recorded in the diary of the French consul Hughes Pouqueville and published by his brother François Pouqueville. 
Athanasios Diakos, a klepht and later a rebel military commander, was captured after the Battle of Alamana (1821), near Thermopylae, and after refusing to convert to Islam and join the Ottoman army, he was impaled. Diakos became a martyr for a Greek independence and was later honored as a national hero. Non-combatant Greeks (elders, monks, women etc.) were impaled around Athens during the first year of the revolution (1821).

====Rebels elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire====
Impaling perceived rebels was an attested practice in other parts of the empire as well, such as the 1809 quelling of a Bosnian revolt, and during the Serbian Revolution (1804–1835) against the Ottoman Empire, about 200 Serbs were impaled in Belgrade in 1814. Historian James J. Reid, in his &quot;Crisis of the Ottoman Empire: Prelude to Collapse 1839–1878&quot;, notes several instances of later use, in particular in times of crises, ordered by military commanders (if not, that is, directly ordered by the supreme authority possessed by the sultan). He notes late instances of impalement during rebellions (rather than cases of robbery) like the Bosnian revolt of 1852, during the Cretan insurrection of 1866–69, and during the insurrections in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1876–77. 
In the Nobel Prize-winning novel &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;, by Ivo Andrić, in the third chapter is described impalement of a Bosnian Serb, who was trying to sabotage the bridge&#x27;s construction.

====Armenian and Assyrian Genocide====

Aurora Mardiganian, a survivor of the Armenian genocide of 1915–1923, discussing the scene of crucifixion in the biographical film of her life, stated that the actual killings were by impalement.

A Russian clergyman who visited ravaged Christian villages in northwestern Persia claimed that he found the remains of several impaled people. He wrote: &quot;The bodies were so firmly fixed, in some instances, that the stakes could not be withdrawn; it was necessary to saw them off and bury the victims as they were.&quot;

<text>Cujo () is a 1981 horror novel by American writer Stephen King about a rabid Saint Bernard. The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1982 and was made into a film in 1983. Cujo&#x27;s name was based on the alias of Willie Wolfe, one of the men responsible for orchestrating Patty Hearst&#x27;s kidnapping and indoctrination into the Symbionese Liberation Army. King discusses &quot;Cujo&quot; in &quot;On Writing&quot;, referring to it as a novel he &quot;barely remembers writing at all.&quot; King wrote the book during the height of his struggle with alcohol addiction. King goes on to say he likes the book and wishes he could remember enjoying the good parts as he put them on the page.

==Background==

According to King, the novel was partly inspired by his trip to a mechanic during the spring of 1977. In a 2006 interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, King describes how issues with his motorcycle led him to visit an auto shop on the northern outskirts of Bridgton, Maine. He claims his motorcycle died when he arrived at the shop, and moments after, a Saint Bernard emerged from the garage, growling at him and eventually lunging for his hand. Although the mechanic stopped the dog from harming King by hitting the dog&#x27;s hindquarters with a wrench, King was still startled by the encounter. This incident, as well as a story published in a Portland, Maine, newspaper about a young child who was killed by a Saint Bernard, provided inspiration for the novel. King also owned a dysfunctional Ford Pinto at the time, which is the same car model the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Donna Trenton, drives to the auto garage where she encounters the rabid Cujo.

==Plot==
In 1977, the middle-class Trentons move from New York City to Castle Rock, Maine. In the summer of 1980, Vic learns that Donna has recently had an affair with local tennis player Steve Kemp. In the midst of this household tension, Vic&#x27;s advertising agency is failing due to a scandal over a cereal. Vic is forced to go on a business trip, leaving Donna and their son, four-year-old Tad, at home alone. 

Joe Camber is a blue-collar mechanic who abuses his wife, Charity, and their ten-year-old son, Brett. Charity wins a $5,000 () lottery prize and uses the proceeds to bargain with Joe to allow her to take Brett on a trip to visit Charity&#x27;s sister in Connecticut and show him the possibility of a better life. Joe acquiesces and secretly plans to take a pleasure trip to Boston with his friend Gary Pervier, an alcoholic war veteran. 

The Cambers&#x27; dog Cujo, a large, good-natured Saint Bernard, chases a rabbit in the nearby wilderness and inserts his head in a small cave. A bat bites him on the nose and infects him with rabies, against which Cujo has not been vaccinated. Cujo enters the prodromal phase, becoming lethargic and irritable. After Charity and Brett leave town, Cujo kills Joe and Gary. 

Donna, with Tad, takes their failing Ford Pinto to Joe&#x27;s house for repairs. The car breaks down in the Cambers&#x27; dooryard, and as Donna attempts to find Joe, Cujo attacks her. She gets back into the car but becomes trapped when Cujo continues to attack them. The interior of the car becomes increasingly hot in the summer sun. During one escape attempt, Donna is bitten in the stomach and leg but manages to escape back into the car. Tad becomes catatonic with fear and begins to have seizures.

Steve goes to the Trenton home to attack Donna after she ends their affair, and ransacks the empty house. Vic returns to Castle Rock after failed attempts to contact his wife. The police suspect Steve of kidnapping Donna and Tad. Sheriff George Bannerman is sent to the Cambers&#x27; house, but Cujo attacks and kills him. After witnessing the attack and realizing Tad is in danger of dying of dehydration, Donna battles the weakened Cujo and stabs him with a broken baseball bat. Vic arrives as the fight ends, but Tad has already died from dehydration and heatstroke. A veterinarian performs a necropsy on Cujo to check for rabies prior to the cremation of his remains. Charity receives a phone call speaking about the deaths of Tad and her husband due to Cujo&#x27;s rampage.

Several months later, the Trenton and Camber families are trying to move on. Donna completed her treatment for rabies and her injuries healed. The Trentons&#x27; marriage has survived, as well as Vic&#x27;s business, and they mourn Tad together. Charity, now working in order to support herself and Brett, gives her son a new, vaccinated puppy. In postscript, it is said that the hole Cujo chased the rabbit into was never discovered, and the bats abandoned it. It also reiterates to the reader that Cujo was a good dog who always tried to keep his owners happy, but the ravage of rabies drove him to violence.

==Critical reception==
Upon its initial release in 1981, the novel earned and maintained a high position on bestseller lists in the United States. Some critics have criticized the novel for its ending. The 1983 film adaptation of the novel featured a more optimistic conclusion. &quot;Cujo&quot; received the following accolades:

* Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (1982)
* Balrog Award Nominee for Best Novel (1982)

<doc id="236605" wikidata="Q352035" url="?curid=236605" title="Quintus Lutatius Catulus (consul 102 BC)">
<text>Quintus Lutatius Catulus (149–87 BC) was a consul of the Roman Republic in 102 BC. His consular colleague was Gaius Marius. During their consulship the Cimbri and Teutones marched south again and threatened the Republic. While Marius marched against the Teutones in Gaul, Catulus had to keep the Cimbri from invading Italy. In this he failed; the Cimbri succeeded in invading the Po Valley. In 101 BC Catulus, as proconsul, continued the war against the Cimbri. Marius, elected consul for the fifth time, joined him and together they campaigned against the Germanic invaders in the Po Valley. At the Battle of Vercellae Marius and Catulus decisively defeated the Cimbri and ended the Germanic invasion. After Vercellae the two feuded, and Catulus consequently committed suicide following Marius&#x27;s victory in the civil war of 87 BC.

==As a General==
During Catulus&#x27; consulship, the Romans found out the wandering Cimbri and Teutones were planning to invade Italy. Catulus, as junior consul, was sent to defend the passes through the Alps from Noricum against the Cimbri while the senior consul, Gaius Marius, campaigned against the Teutones and their allies the Ambrones in Gaul. While he was up in the Alps, Catulus pacified much of the territory&#x27;s tribes with the help of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who served Catulus as a legate. Catulus found his task impractical, because there were multiple passes and he would have to divide and weaken his army; he decided to retreat to a more defensible position. During the retreat Catulus became worried the Cimbri would corner his army; therefore he decide to attempt to score a minor victory in order to extricate his troops from the region. He led his army onto a mountain, which overlooked the Cimbri camp, and then ordered his men to remain ready for battle while he had a camp raised in view of the barbarians. When night fell Catulus attacked the Cimbri, then used the chaos this caused to cross a stream and continue his march southwards. Catulus marched until he reached the Atesis River; there he ordered his men to construct fortifications on both sides of the river with a bridge between them. When the Cimbri arrived, they made camp and investigated Catulus&#x27; defences. Their scouts reported they could not cross the river anywhere in the immediate area, so they decided to dam the Atesis by throwing earth, rocks, and trees into the stream creating a makeshift dam. Unnerved by the diminishing water flow the Romans started to break camp. Catulus unsuccessfully tried to get his troops back to their stations. When the Cimbri finally launched their assault, they found just one cohort defending the camp on the far side of the river. These men fought with courage and somehow managed to escape. Catulus had retreated in the face of the enemy twice, but he had kept his army intact. The following year (101) his command was prolonged and he was given proconsular powers. 

The Cimbri, who had advanced into the Po Valley, were eventually defeated on the Raudine plain, near Vercellae, by the combined armies of Catulus and Gaius Marius. Catulus commanded the Roman centre during the battle and redeemed himself by leading his men to victory. For his part in the victory over the Cimbri he was awarded a Triumph. Despite their joint success, the two commanders regarded each other as bitter rivals and after the war built competing temples to demonstrate divine favour.

When the chief honour for victory over the Cimbri was given to Marius, Catulus turned vehemently against his former co-commander and sided with Sulla to expel Marius, Cornelius Cinna and their supporters from Rome. When Cinna and Marius regained control of the city in 87 BC, Catulus was prosecuted by Marius&#x27;s nephew, Marcus Marius Gratidianus. Rather than accept the inevitable guilty verdict, he committed suicide.

==As an Author==
Catulus was a distinguished orator, poet and prose writer, and was well versed in Greek literature. He wrote a history of his consulship (&quot;De consulatu et de rebus gestis suis&quot;) in the manner of Xenophon. A non-extant epic on the Cimbrian War, sometimes attributed to him, was more likely written by Archias. Catulus&#x27;s contributions to Latin poetry are considered his most significant literary achievements. He is credited with introducing the Hellenistic epigram to Rome and fostering a taste for short, personal poems that comes to fruition with the lyric oeuvre of Valerius Catullus in the 50s BC. Among his circle of literary friends, who ranged widely in social position and political sympathies, were Valerius Aedituus, Aulus Furius, and Porcius Licinius.

Pliny lists him among distinguished men who wrote short poems that were less than austere (&quot;versiculi parum severi&quot;). Only two epigrams by Catulus have been preserved, both directed at men. Cicero preserves one of Catulus&#x27;s couplets on the celebrated actor Roscius, who is said to make an entrance like a sunrise: &quot;though he is human, he seems more beautiful than a god.&quot;

The other epigram, modelled directly after Callimachus, is quoted by Aulus Gellius and may be paraphrased in prose as follows:

&quot;The willingness of a member of the highest Roman aristocracy to toss off imitations of Hellenistic sentimental erotic poetry (homosexual at that),&quot; notes Edward Courtney, &quot;is a new phenomenon in Roman culture at this time.&quot;

==As a Builder==
Catulus was a man of great wealth, which he spent in beautifying Rome. Two buildings were known as &quot;Monumenta Catuli&quot;: the Temple of &quot;Fortuna Huiusce Diei&quot; (the &quot;Fortune of This Day&quot;), to commemorate the day of Vercellae, and the &quot;Porticus Catuli&quot;, built from the sale of the Cimbrian spoils.

==Family==
Catulus&#x27; mother Popillia later married a Lucius Julius Caesar and by him was mother to Lucius Julius Caesar and Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo. Cicero lauded Catulus for the panegyric he delivered on the death of his mother, describing it as the first time a Roman matron had been so honoured.

Three wives are attested for Catulus:
# Domitia of the Ahenobarbi, the mother of his son Quintus Lutatius Catulus Capitolinus (consul 78, censor 65 BC).
# Servilia of the Caepiones, who was mother of his daughter Lutatia, the wife of the great orator Quintus Hortensius (consul 69).
# Claudia, of uncertain family but probably of the Marian aligned branch of Marcelli, likely a daughter of Marius&#x27; friend and legate Marcus Claudius Marcellus. This was probably Catulus&#x27; longest marriage (c. 103-87 BC), if, as seems likely, he wed her to secure Marian support for his election as a consul, which he only belatedly achieved at the &quot;comitia&quot; in 103 for 102 BC. However, she is only attested as his wife at the time of his death at the end of 87 BC. There is no record of any children by this match.

An approximate chronology of the marital affairs of Catulus:
* c. 126 BC: Married Domitia
* 125 or 124 BC: Birth of Catulus Capitolinus
* c. 111 BC: Death or divorce of Domitia
* c. 109 BC: Praetor, married Servilia. She was probably the eldest daughter (born around 124 BC) of his coeval, and colleague as praetor, Quintus Servilius Caepio (cos. 106 BC). The latter&#x27;s apparently promiscuous daughters were harshly abused as whores by Timagenes of Alexandreia.
* c. 108 BC: Birth of Lutatia (mother of Hortensia Oratrix and Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, the poet and Caesarian)
* 105 BC: Arausio disaster, and disgrace and imprisonment of Quintus Servilius Caepio
* 104 BC: Caepio escaped into exile and Catulus divorces Caepio&#x27;s daughter Servilia
* 103 BC: Catulus married Claudia and is finally elected consul for 102 BC after three previous defeats.

==In fiction==
Catulus appears in Colleen McCullough&#x27;s &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; novels. Rather than a half brother to Caesar Strabo and Lucius Caesar, McCullough depicts Catulus as having been born a Caesar and adopted into the Lutatius Catulus family; she names him &quot;Catulus Caesar&quot; according to the custom of retaining the former name. 

This version of Catulus is a pompous aristocrat and an inept general during his consulship with Marius in &quot;The First Man in Rome&quot;. When fighting the Cimbri his senior legate, Sulla, forces him, on threat of mutiny, to retreat to a more defensible position.

<doc id="236606" wikidata="Q649056" url="?curid=236606" title="Diaphragm pump">
<text>A diaphragm pump (also known as a Membrane pump) is a positive displacement pump that uses a combination of the reciprocating action of a rubber, thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves on either side of the diaphragm
(check valve, butterfly valves, flap valves, or any other form of shut-off valves) to pump a fluid.

There are three main types of diaphragm pumps:
* Those in which the diaphragm is sealed with one side in the fluid to be pumped, and the other in air or hydraulic fluid. The diaphragm is flexed, causing the volume of the pump chamber to increase and decrease. A pair of non-return check valves prevent reverse flow of the fluid.
* Those employing volumetric positive displacement where the prime mover of the diaphragm is electro-mechanical, working through a crank or geared motor drive, or purely mechanical, such as with a lever or handle. This method flexes the diaphragm through simple mechanical action, and one side of the diaphragm is open to air.
* Those employing one or more unsealed diaphragms with the fluid to be pumped on both sides. The diaphragm(s) again are flexed, causing the volume to change.

When the volume of a chamber of either type of pump is increased (the diaphragm moving up), the pressure decreases, and fluid is drawn into the chamber. When the chamber pressure later increases from decreased volume (the diaphragm moving down), the fluid previously drawn in is forced out. Finally, the diaphragm moving up once again draws fluid into the chamber, completing the cycle. This action is similar to that of the cylinder in an internal combustion engine. Diaphragm Pumps deliver a hermetic seal between the drive mechanism and the compression chamber, allowing the pump to transfer, compress, and evacuate the medium without a lubricant.

An elastomeric diaphragm can be used as a versatile dynamic seal that removes many of the limitations found with other sealing methods. They do not leak, offer little friction, and can be constructed for low pressure sensitivity. With the right material consideration, diaphragms can seal over a wide range of pressures and temperatures without needing lubrication or maintenance.

== Characteristics ==
Diaphragm pump characteristics are:
* Self-regulated: The flow rate of an air-powered diaphragm pump can be easily set from zero to maximum just by adjusting the air inlet or the fluid outlet valve. No need to stop running the pump before closing the fluid outlet valve. The pump will just stop by itself and will not consume energy or overheat. Reopening the valve will make the pump restart to resume operation.
* Self priming and have good suction lift characteristics.
* Can be designed to handle abrasive sludges and slurries with a relatively high amount of grit and solid content.
* Have good dry running characteristics.
* Handle fluids smoothly and carefully, the diaphragm pump design avoids mechanical or chemical damages to the fluid during the transfer: No shear, no foam and no heating.
* Pump design separates pump fluids from potentially sensitive internal pump parts.
* A multitude of different diaphragm elastomers can be selected, allowing compatibility with very corrosive solutions.
* Can handle low to medium viscous liquids. A viscosity correction chart can be used as a tool to help prevent under-sizing AOD pumps.
* Can be effectively driven by compressed air or by electricity. Air driven versions typically achieve the safety requirements to operate in flammable or explosive atmospheres.
* Hydraulically driven versions are suitable for discharge pressure up to 1,200 bar.
* Internal pump parts can be suspended and isolated within oil, to promote pump longevity.
* Can be up to 97% efficient.
== Air compressors ==
Small mechanically activated diaphragm pumps are also used as air compressors and as a source of low-grade vacuum. Compared to other designs, diaphragm compressors are quiet, cheap, and have no moving parts in the air stream. This allows them to be used without added lubrication in contact with the air, so the compressed air produced can be guaranteed clean. An example is a typical aquarium air pump.

<doc id="236609" wikidata="Q1131847" url="?curid=236609" title="Coracle">
<text>A coracle is a small, rounded, lightweight boat of the sort traditionally used in Wales, and also in parts of the west of Ireland and also particularly on the River Boyne, and in Scotland, particularly the River Spey. The word is also used for similar boats found in India, Vietnam, Iraq, and Tibet. The word &quot;coracle&quot; is an English spelling of the original Welsh , cognate with Irish and Scottish Gaelic , and is recorded in English text as early as the sixteenth century. Other historical English spellings include &quot;corougle&quot;, &quot;corracle&quot;, &quot;curricle&quot; and &quot;coricle&quot;.

==Structure==
The structure is made of a framework of split and interwoven willow rods, tied with willow bark. The outer layer was originally an animal skin such as horse or bullock hide (corium), with a thin layer of tar to waterproof it; today replaced by tarred calico, canvas, or fibreglass. The Vietnamese/Asian version of the coracle is made of interwoven bamboo and made water proof by using resin and coconut oil. Oval in shape and very similar to half a walnut shell, the coracle has a keel-less flat bottom to evenly spread the load across the structure and to reduce the required depth of water; often to only a few inches. This structure helps to make the boat more maneuverable and less likely to snag when used on narrow and/or shallow slow-running waterways.
Each coracle is tailored to the local river conditions. In general there is one design per river, but this is not always the case. The Teifi coracle, for instance, is flat-bottomed, as it is designed to negotiate shallow rapids, common on the river in the summer, while the Carmarthen coracle is rounder and deeper, because it is used in tidal waters on the Tywi, where there are no rapids. Teifi coracles are made from locally harvested wood: willow for the laths (body of the boat), hazel for the weave ( in Welsh.) Tywi coracles have been made from sawn ash for a long time. The working boats tend to be made from fibreglass these days. Teifi coracles use no nails, relying on the interweaving of the laths for structural coherence, whilst the Carmarthen ones use copper nails and no interweaving.

They are an effective fishing vessel because, when powered by a skilled person, they hardly disturb the water or the fish, and they can be easily manoeuvred with one arm, while the other arm tends to the net; two coracles to a net. The coracle is propelled by means of a broad-bladed paddle, which traditionally varies in design between different rivers. It is used in a sculling action, the blade describing a figure-of-eight pattern in the water. The paddle is used towards the front of the coracle, pulling the boat forward, with the paddler facing in the direction of travel.

The Welsh Coracle is intended to be carried on the back; Welsh saying is (load of a man is his coracle).

==History==

Designed for use in swiftly flowing streams, the coracle has been in use in the British Isles for millennia, having been noted by Julius Caesar in his invasion of Britain in the mid first century BC, and used in his military campaigns in Spain. Remains interpreted as a possible coracle were found in an Early Bronze Age grave at Barns Farm near Dalgety Bay, and others have been described, from Corbridge and from near North Ferriby.

Where coracle fishing is performed by two coraclers the net is stretched across the river between the two coracles. The coraclers will paddle one handed, dragging the net in the other, and draw the net downstream. When a fish is caught, each hauls up an end of the net until the two boats are brought to touch, and the fish is then secured, using a priest (or knocker – a small block of wood) to stun the fish.

A new tax was introduced in 1863 on the commercial capture of migratory fish in Wales; this led to a decline in the number of coracles. During the 1930s, the government decided to begin revoking the licences of commercial fisher families on the death of the main licensees. It took some years for this plan to be completed but eventually led to a more significant decline in the number of craft. 

In the 1920s and 30s James Hornell visited hundreds of rivers in the British Isles to talk with remaining coracle makers and users. He documented the tradition in his book &quot;British Coracles and the Curraghs of Ireland&quot; (The Society for Nautical Research, 1938) containing drawings, diagrams and construction details gleaned from regular makers. 

===Current status===
Coracles are now seen regularly only in tourist areas of West Wales, and irregularly in Shropshire on the River Severn. A public house in Sundorne, Shrewsbury called &quot;The Coracle&quot; has a pub sign featuring a man using a coracle on a river. The Welsh rivers Teifi and Tywi are the most common places to find coracles in Wales. On the Teifi they are most frequently seen between Cenarth, and Cilgerran and the village of Llechryd.

In 1974, a Welsh coracle piloted by Bernard Thomas (c. 1923–2014) of Llechryd crossed the English Channel to France in hours. The journey was undertaken to support a claim that Bull Boats of the Mandan Indians of North Dakota in the US could have been copied from coracles introduced by Prince Madog in the 12th century.

For many years until 1979, Shrewsbury coracle maker Fred Davies achieved some notability amongst football fans; he would sit in his coracle during Shrewsbury Town FC home matches at Gay Meadow, and retrieve stray balls from the River Severn. Although Davies died in 1994, his story is still associated with the club.

==Safety==
The design of the coracle makes it an unstable craft. Because it sits &quot;on&quot; the water, rather than &quot;in&quot; it, the vessel can easily be carried by currents and the wind. The Coracle Society has published guidelines for safely using coracles.

==Similar craft==

The oldest instructions yet found for construction of a coracle are contained in precise directions on a four-thousand-year-old cuneiform tablet supposedly dictated by the Mesopotamian god Enki to Atra-Hasis on how to build a round &quot;ark&quot;. The tablet is about 2,250 years older than previously discovered accounts of flood myths, none of which contain such details. These instructions depict a vessel that is today known as a (), or Iraqi coracle.

Many scholars believe that the basket that baby Moses was cast adrift in on the Nile (in Exodus 2:3) was in fact a coracle or quffa, based on the similarity of that passage to Neo-Assyrian legends depicting infants cast adrift on rivers in .

The Irish (also or ) is a similar, but larger, vessel still in use today. Curachs were also used in the west of Scotland:

The currachs in the River Spey were particularly similar to Welsh coracles. Other related craft include:

* India – 
* Iraq – or 
* Native American societies – bull boat
* Tibet – &quot;ku-dru&quot; and &quot;kowas&quot;
* Vietnam – or 

=== Indian coracle ===
Indian coracles ( ; , , , , &#x27;crab&#x27;) are commonly found on the rivers Kaveri and Tungabhadra in Southern India. Coracles are light, bowl-shaped boats with a frame of woven grasses, reeds or saplings covered with hides. Indian coracles are considered to have been in existence since prehistoric times, and are a major tourist attraction at the Hogenakkal falls on the Kaveri river. Although these boats were originally designed for general transport, they have recently been used mostly for giving tourists rides.

====Types====
The coracles found in the Hogenakkal are of two types, which differ mainly in size. The smaller ones are about 6.2 feet (1.9 metres) in diameter, and are used primarily for fishing. The larger ones, which measure up to 8.4 feet (2.6 metres) in diameter, are used for tourists.

====Design====
Indian coracles are either saucer or bowl shaped and circular, with the greatest diameter across the mouth. The circular coracles in Iraq are very similar, but they have convexly curved sides, and thus the mouth is not the widest part. Indian coracles are on average about 7.3 feet (2.24 metres) in diameter, but can still hold eight people at a time. Other kinds of coracles usually can only hold one person. Indian coracles, and coracles in general, are made of bamboo and take about a day to build, given all the necessary materials. The bottoms of the boats are covered in hides, sometimes with sheets of plastic, or sometimes the bottom is tarred in order to make them waterproof. In modern times, a sheet of LDPE plastic is often embedded between two layers of bamboo. Coracles are steered and propelled using a single paddle from the front of the boat in the direction of travel, making them unique.

====Construction====
The boats are made primarily from bamboo. The first step in construction is a basic framework woven from bamboo sticks. Then the bottom is further reinforced with the addition of more bamboo sticks, making the boat&#x27;s base sturdy. Once the bottom is structurally sound, the lowest points of the sides are defined by a circumferential band of three flat strips of bamboo woven into the existing lattice. The sides of the boat are then made with 20 to 30 adjacent strips of bamboo. Finally this framework is again strengthened by lightweight bamboo, making sure that the sides are not heavier than the base.

The boats had earlier been waterproofed by using hides of animals, but these days plastic sheets are used for this purpose as they are cheaper as well as easily available. The waterproofing is further enhanced by a layer of tar, a feature which is common in most contemporary coracles.

====Local names====
* , sometimes spelt – Tamil
* or – Kannada
* in Telugu
* in Malayalam

===Iraqi coracle===

Iraqi coracles, called or (), have been used as ferries, lighters, fishing vessels, and water taxis on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers since at least the 9th century BC. They share details with the myriad types of coracle used across Eurasia. Modern can be up to 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter and carry four to five tons. Modern are of similar size and construction as their ancient counterparts, with both being made from woven bundles of reeds or basketry waterproofed with bitumen.

=== Vietnamese coracle ===
The Vietnamese battle coracle, called &#x27; or &#x27;, dated back to the 10th century, is traditionally believed to have been created by a general named Tran Ung Long to be used in battles. However, thuyen thung were probably strongly developed during the French colonial period when the colonialists imposed high taxes on seafaring, local fishermen built coracles to avoid the regulations on boats.

===Pelota===
The pelota of South and Central America was a hide vessel similar to a coracle, but it often lacked an internal wooden framework, relying entirely on the stiffness of the hide to stay afloat. Thus it could be carried about on horseback and deployed when there was a river to cross.

<doc id="236613" wikidata="Q172303" url="?curid=236613" title="Tyra Banks">
<text>Tyra Lynne Banks (born December 4, 1973), also known as BanX, is an American model, television personality, producer, writer, and actress. Born in Inglewood, California, she began her career as a model at the age of 15 and was the first Black American woman to be featured on the covers of &quot;GQ&quot; and the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;, on which she appeared three times. Banks was one of only a few Black models to achieve Supermodel status. She was a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel from 1997 to 2005. By the early 2000s, Banks was one of the world&#x27;s top-earning models.

Banks began acting on television in the sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (1993) and made her film debut in the drama &quot;Higher Learning&quot; (1995). In 2000, she had major film roles, such as Eve in Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Life-Size&quot; and Zoe in the box-office hit &quot;Coyote Ugly.&quot; Banks had small roles in the romantic sports film &quot;Love &amp; Basketball&quot; (2000), the horror film &quot;&quot; (2002), and in the television series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; (2009) and &quot;Glee&quot; (2013).

In 2003, Banks created the long-running reality television series &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, which she executive produced and presented for the first twenty-two seasons, until the series&#x27; cancellation in October 2015. She remained executive producer for the revival of the series in 2016 and enlisted Rita Ora as host for the twenty-third cycle before reassuming the duties herself for the twenty-fourth cycle. Banks was the co-creator of &quot;True Beauty&quot; (2009–2010), and had her own television talk show, &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot; (2005–2010), which aired on The CW and won two Daytime Emmy awards for Outstanding Talk Show Informative. In 2015, she co-hosted the talk show &quot;FABLife&quot; for two months. In 2017, Banks was the host of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; for its 12th season. In 2020, she was the host of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for its 29th season, also serving as an executive producer.

In 2010, Banks published a young adult novel titled &quot;Modelland&quot;, based on her life as a model, which topped &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in 2011. She also has her own production company, Bankable Productions, which produced &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, and the 2008 film &quot;The Clique&quot;. Banks is one of four African Americans and seven women to have repeatedly been ranked among the world&#x27;s most influential people by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. She is also one of only seventeen models to be ranked as a Legendary Supermodel by MODELS.com.

== Early life and education==
Tyra Lynne Banks was born in Inglewood, California, on December 4, 1973. Her mother, Carolyn London (now London-Johnson), is a medical photographer, and her father, Donald Banks, is a computer consultant. She has a brother, Devin, who is five years older. In 1979, when Banks was six years old, her parents divorced. Banks attended John Burroughs Middle School and graduated in 1991 from Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles. Banks has said that while growing up, she was teased for her appearance and considered an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;; when Banks was 11 years old, she grew three inches and lost 30 pounds in three months. On &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, Banks discussed the results of an Ancestry.com genealogical DNA test that gave her &quot;79% African, 14% British, and 6% Native American&quot; results. In an interview, she added that she is also &quot;1% Finnish&quot;, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m 14% British, 6% Native American, 1% Finnish, and all the rest African.&quot;
In February 2012, Banks completed a nine-week course at Harvard University&#x27;s Owner/President Management non-degree extension program.

==Modeling career==

When Banks was 15 years old, she started modeling while attending school in Los Angeles. She was rejected by four modeling agencies before she was signed by L.A. Models. She switched to Elite Model Management at age 16. When she got the opportunity to model in Europe, she moved to Milan. In her first runway season, she booked 25 shows in the 1991 Paris Fashion Week. Banks appeared in editorials for American, Italian, French, and Spanish &quot;Vogue&quot;; American, French, German, and Spanish &quot;Elle&quot;; American, German, and Malaysian &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;; &quot;V&quot;; &quot;W&quot; and Vanity Fair.

She appeared on the covers of magazines such as &quot;Elle&quot;; &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;; Spanish &quot;Vogue&quot;; &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;; &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;. She walked in fashion shows for Chanel, Oscar de la Renta, Yves Saint Laurent, Anna Sui, Christian Dior, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Perry Ellis, Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, Herve Leger, Valentino, Fendi, Isaac Mizrahi, Giorgio Armani, Sonia Rykiel, Michael Kors and others. She appeared in advertising campaigns for Yves Saint Laurent, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Escada, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Halston, H&amp;M, XOXO, Swatch, Versace, Christian Lacroix, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Got Milk?, Pepsi and Nike. In 1993, Banks signed a contract with CoverGirl cosmetics, launching advertising campaigns for the cosmetics company. She was one of only a few Black models to achieve Supermodel status. In the mid-1990s, Banks returned to America to do more commercial modeling.

Banks was the first Black woman on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; and the first African-American woman on the cover of &quot;GQ&quot;. In 1997, she received the VH1 award for &quot;Supermodel of the Year&quot;. That year, she was the first African American chosen for the cover of the Victoria&#x27;s Secret catalog, and became a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel. In 2010, Banks re-signed with her former modeling agency IMG Models. Banks is now a contributor of the &quot;Vogue Italia&quot; website. In 2013, Banks transformed herself into 15 supermodels, in collaboration with fashion photographer Udo Spreitzenbarth.

In 2019, Banks came out of her modeling retirement to pose for one of the three 2019 &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; covers; the other cover models being Camille Kostek and Alex Morgan. It marked her third cover for the publication, 22 years after her first. She also announced that she will now go by the modeling name BanX.

In 2024, Banks came out of her runway retirement to walk for the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show as the closing model. 

==Television and film career==
Banks&#x27;s television career began on the fourth season of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, in which she played lead character Will Smith&#x27;s old friend Jackie Ames. She made seven appearances in the series.

Smize &amp; Dream first sold package ice cream in California. It has subsequently opened pop-up ice cream shops in Los Angeles, Dubai, Washington, D.C., and Sydney.
==Personal life==

Banks dated Norwegian photographer Erik Asla during the 2010s. Banks struggled with infertility and her and Asla&#x27;s attempts to conceive through in vitro fertilisation were unsuccessful. January 2016, their son York Banks Asla was born via gestational surrogacy. Banks has stated that she tends to avoid drinking and has never used other recreational drugs.

Banks has spoken out about abusive relationships in her past. In 2005, when asked about her relationship history, she stated, &quot;I won&#x27;t be using a lot of names on the show, but a specific relationship had not just cheating but emotional abuse. It was really bad, but that made me strong.&quot; In 2009, she opened up about her past relationships when she made a guest appearance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show,&quot; hosting alongside Oprah Winfrey. The episode was dedicated to dating violence in response to the assault of Rihanna by Chris Brown.

In January 2025, Banks&#x27; home in Los Angeles was destroyed by a wildfire. She was in Australia at the time.

===Education===

In 2012, Banks completed Harvard Business School&#x27;s nine-week executive education Owner/President Management Program (OPM). After Banks mentioned that she was attending Harvard in an interview, many news publications published articles clarifying the difference between the OPM program and the more widely-known Harvard MBA program. As of 2012, Harvard professor Rohit Deshpande was preparing a case study on Banks&#x27;s company, Bankable Productions, for use in future coursework in the OPM program.

<text>Aulus Gabinius ( – 48 or 47 BC) was a politician and general of the Roman Republic. He had an important career, culminating with a consulship in 58 BC, mainly thanks to the patronage of Pompey. His name is mostly associated with the &quot;lex Gabinia&quot;, a law he passed as tribune of the plebs in 67 BC that granted Pompey an extraordinary command in the Mediterranean Sea to fight the pirates.

==Career==

In 67 BC, as a tribune of the plebs, Gabinius brought forward the law (&quot;Lex Gabinia&quot;) which gave Pompey the command in the war against Mediterranean pirates, with extensive powers that gave him absolute control over the sea and the coasts for 50 miles inland. Through Gabinius&#x27; two other measures, loans of money to foreign ambassadors in Rome were made actionable (as a check on the corruption of the Senate) and the Senate was ordered to give audiences to foreign envoys on certain fixed days (February 1 – March 1) each year.

From 66–62 BC, during the final phases of the Third Mithridatic War, Gabinius served Pompey as a legate. In 65 BC Pompey gave him command of a part of his army and sent him into Northern Mesopotamia to pressure the Parthian king, Phraates III into a treaty with Pompey. From Northern Mesopotamia Gabinius marched into Syria to help rid the region of pirates and brigands. Aristobulus, brother of the high priest and king of Judea Hyrcanus II, bribed him to support his [Aristobulus] claim to the Judean throne. When Pompey arrived in Antioch in Syria, Aristobulus sent an official deputation, fearing the fortune he had spent to persuade Pompey&#x27;s legates might be wasted, he accused Gabinius and Scaurus of accepting bribes. It is unknown if Pompey did anything with these accusations.

In 61 BC, as praetor, tried to win public favour by providing games on a scale of unusual splendour. In 59 BC, Gabinius ran for one of the consulships for 58 and managed to get himself elected, although not without the suspicion of bribery. He was elected consul alongside Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law. During his term of office he aided Publius Clodius Pulcher in bringing about the exile of Marcus Tullius Cicero. Gabinius also managed to secure Syria as his proconsular province.

In 57 BC Gabinius started his term as governor of Syria. Shortly after his arrival he marched his army south into Judaea, defeated the army of Alexander, Hyrcanus II&#x27;s nephew, in a battle near Jeruzalem, and reinstated Hyrcanus II as high-priest of Jerusalem, He suppressed revolts, introduced important changes in the government of Judaea and rebuilt several towns. He also supported Mithridates IV in his struggle against his brother Orodes but abandoned Mithridates when the more lucrative offer of restoring Ptolemy XII Auletes to the Egyptian throne reached him.

In 55 BC Pompey convinced Gabinius to march to Egypt to restore Ptolemy XII to his throne. Gabinius did so without the consent of the Senate. He succeeded after a short successful campaign, in which he was supported by the young cavalry officer Mark Antony. He left some of his troops, the so-called Gabiniani, in Egypt to protect Ptolemy XII. These Gabiniani fought against rebellious subjects of the king and later, after the king&#x27;s death, against Gaius Julius Caesar.

During Gabinius&#x27;s time in Egypt, Syria had been devastated by robbers, and Alexander, son of Aristobulus, had again taken up arms with the object of depriving Hyrcanus II of the high-priesthood. Gabinius marched into Judea and defeated Alexander near Mount Tabor killing 10,000 of Alexander&#x27;s men. With some difficulty Gabinius restored order in Syria, and in 54 BC handed over the province to his successor, Marcus Licinius Crassus. The Roman equites (knights), who as tax collectors had suffered heavy losses during the disturbances in Syria, were greatly embittered against Gabinius, and, when he appeared in the Senate to give an account of his governorship, he was brought to trial on three counts, all involving a capital offence.

On the charge of &quot;maiestas&quot; (high treason) incurred by having left his province for Egypt without the consent of the Senate and in defiance of the Sibylline Books, Gabinius was acquitted. It was said that the judges were bribed, and even Cicero, an enemy of Gabinius, was persuaded by Pompey to say as little as he could. On the second charge, that of &quot;repetundae&quot; (extortion during the administration of his province), with special reference to the 10,000 talents paid by Ptolemy XII for his restoration, he was found guilty, in spite of evidence offered on his behalf by Pompey and witnesses from Alexandria and the eloquence of Cicero, who had been induced to plead his cause. Nothing but Cicero&#x27;s wish to do a favour to Pompey could have induced him to take on the task. Commentators hint that the half-heartedness of Cicero&#x27;s defence contributed to Gabinius&#x27;s condemnation. The third charge, that of &quot;ambitus&quot; (illegalities committed during his canvassing for the consulship), was consequently dropped. Gabinius went into exile and his property was confiscated.

After the outbreak of Civil War in 49 BC, Gabinius was recalled by Gaius Julius Caesar and entered his service, but took no active part against his old patron, Pompey. After the Battle of Pharsalus, he was commissioned to transport some recently levied troops to Illyricum. On his way overland, he was attacked by the Dalmatians and with difficulty made his way to Salona. There Gabinius defended himself against the attacks of the Pompeian commander, Marcus Octavius, but a few months later died of illness (48 BC or the beginning of 47 BC).

==Marriage and children==
Gabinius married a Roman noblewoman called Lollia from the &quot;Lollia&quot; gens, perhaps a daughter of Marcus Lollius Palicanus, tribune of the plebs in 71 BC. Lollia bore him a son called Aulus Gabinius Sisenna.

<doc id="236617" wikidata="Q289168" url="?curid=236617" title="AC Cobra">
<text>The AC Cobra, sold in the United States as the Shelby Cobra and AC Shelby Cobra, is a sports car manufactured by British company AC Cars, with a Ford V8 engine. It was produced intermittently in both the United Kingdom and later the United States since 1962.

== History and development ==
Like many British manufacturers, AC Cars had been using the Bristol straight-6 engine in its small-volume production, including its AC Ace two-seater roadster. The Ace had a hand-built body with a steel tube frame, and aluminium body panels that were made using English wheeling machines. The engine was a pre-World War II design by BMW which by the 1960s was considered dated. In 1961 Bristol decided to cease production of its engine.

In September 1961, Ford provided Shelby with two engines.

== AC Ace 3.6 ==
In January 1962 mechanics at AC Cars in Thames Ditton, Surrey designed the &quot;AC Ace 3.6&quot; prototype with chassis number CSX2000.

AC had already made most of the modifications needed for the small-block V8 when they installed the inline-6 Ford Zephyr engine, including the extensive rework of the AC Ace&#x27;s front end bodywork. The only modification of the front end of the first Cobra from that of the &quot;AC Ace 2.6&quot; was the steering box, which had to be moved outward to clear the wider V8 engine.

The most important modification was the fitting of a stronger rear differential to handle the increased engine power. A Salisbury 4HU unit with inboard disc brakes to reduce unsprung weight was chosen instead of the old E.N.V. unit. It was the same unit used on the Jaguar E-Type.
After testing and modification, the engine and transmission were removed and the chassis was air-freighted to Shelby in Los Angeles on 2 February 1962, By this time the small-block&#x27;s displacement was increased to .

Shelby&#x27;s team paired this engine along with a transmission into CSX2000, in less than eight hours at Dean Moon&#x27;s shop in Santa Fe Springs, California, and began road-testing.

== Production ==
(CSX/CS 2001–2602)

A few changes were made to the production version:
* The inboard brakes were moved outboard to reduce cost.
* The fuel tank filler was relocated from the fender to the center of the trunk. The trunk lid had to be shortened to accommodate this change.

AC exported completed, painted, and trimmed cars (less engine and gearbox) to Shelby who then finished the cars in his workshop in Los Angeles by installing the engine and gearbox and correcting any bodywork flaws caused by the car&#x27;s passage by sea. A small number of cars were also completed on the East Coast of the US by Ed Hugus in Pennsylvania, including the first production car; CSX2001.

The first 75 Cobra Mk1 models (including the prototype) were fitted with the Windsor Ford V8 . The remaining 51 Mk1 models were fitted with the larger version of the engine. After the 289 became available, Shelby offered an upgrade to the earlier cars. Most accepted the upgrade so cars with the 260 CID engine are rare today.

In late 1962, Alan Turner, AC&#x27;s chief engineer, completed a major design change of the car&#x27;s front end to accommodate rack and pinion steering while still using transverse leaf spring suspension (with the leaf spring doubling as the upper suspension link). The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated &quot;Mark II&quot;. The steering rack was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle. About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced from 1963 to the summer of 1965 (the last US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).

== European model ==
(COB/COX 6001–6062)

In 1963 to keep production focused on producing cars for Shelby American Inc., the Ruddspeed Ace was discontinued. To supply cars to the European market, AC began to market and sell the Cobra in Europe. Advertisements from the time state that the Cobra was designed to meet the requirements of Shelby American Inc.

== 390 Big Block Cobra ==

Shelby experimented with a larger Ford FE engine, of in chassis number CSX2196. The car was not able to receive the development it needed, as resources were aimed at taking the crown from Ferrari in the GT class. Ken Miles drove and raced the FE-powered Mark II at Sebring and pronounced the car virtually undrivable, naming it &quot;The Turd&quot;. It failed to finish with the engine expiring due to damper failure.

CSX2196 was revised for the showdown at Nassau which allowed a more relaxed class division of racing. This allowed the Cobras to run with a prototype Ford GT40, GM Grand Sport Corvettes and a Lola Mk6. An aluminium engine was used. By the end of the first lap, the Cobra had a lead of the length of the start-finish straight. However, the car failed to finish due to brake problems.

== Cobra 427 ==
A new chassis was required, developed, and designated &quot;Mark III&quot;. The new car was designed in cooperation with Ford in Detroit. A new chassis was built using main chassis tubes, up from , and coil spring suspension all around (an especially significant change up front, where the previously-used transverse leaf spring had done double duty as the top link). The new car also had wide fenders and a larger radiator opening. It was powered by the &quot;side oiler&quot; Ford FE engine equipped with a single 4-barrel 780 CFM Holley carburetor rated at at 6000 rpm and at 3700 rpm of torque, which provided a top speed of in the standard model. The more powerful tune of with a top speed of in the semi-competition (S/C) model.

;Competition models (CSX/CSB 3001–3100)

Cobra Mark III production began on 1 January 1965; two prototypes had been sent to the United States in October 1964. Cars were sent to the US as unpainted rolling chassis, and they were finished in Shelby&#x27;s workshop.

Unfortunately, The MK III missed homologation for the 1965 racing season and was not raced by the Shelby team. Only 56 of the 100 planned cars were produced. Of those, 31 unsold competition models were detuned and fitted with windscreens for street use. Called S/C for semi-competition, an original example can currently sell for US$1.5 million, making it one of the most valuable Cobra variants.

;Production models (CSX/CSB 3101–3360)

Some Cobra 427s were fitted with Ford&#x27;s engine, a long stroke, smaller bore, lower cost engine, intended for road use rather than racing. The AC Cobra was a financial failure that led Ford and Carroll Shelby to discontinue importing cars from England in 1967.

== AC 289 Sports ==
(COB/COX 6101–6132)

AC Cars kept producing the coil-spring AC Roadster with narrow fenders and a small block Ford 289. It was built and sold in Europe until late 1969.

== Packages ==
===Dragon Snake===
Shelby offered a drag package, known as the Dragon Snake, which won several NHRA National events with Bruce Larson or Ed Hedrick at the wheel of CSX2093.

Only six 289 Dragon Snake Cobras were produced by the factory: &quot;2019&quot;, &quot;2357&quot; as factory team cars, and &quot;2248&quot;, &quot;2416&quot;, &quot;2427&quot;, &quot;2472&quot; as private team cars. One 427 Dragon Snake, 3198, was produced.
Cobras were also prepared by customers using the drag package. Examples include: &quot;2075&quot;, &quot;2093&quot;, &quot;2109&quot;, &quot;2353&quot;, and 3159 &quot;King Cobra.&quot;

===Slalom Snake===

Designed for auto-cross events, only two examples were produced, the CSX2522 &quot;Slalom Special&quot;, and the CSX2537 &quot;Slalom Snake&quot;. Both had white exterior paint (with red racing stripes) and red leather interiors.
Equipped almost identically to CSX2522, the second example had aluminum valve covers, a tuned air cleaner, a Smiths heater, seat belts, front and rear brake cooling ducts, a hood scoop, brake cooling scoops, side exhausts and a painted roll bar (2522&#x27;s roll bar was chromed). Suspension options included Koni shock absorbers, front and rear anti-sway bars, unpolished six-inch magnesium pin-drive wheels, and Goodyear Blue Streak Sports Car Special tires.

===Super Snake===

In 1966, CSX 3015 S/C was selected and converted into a special model called the Super Snake, the &quot;Cobra to End All Cobras.&quot; Originally part of a European promotional tour before its conversion. This conversion called for making the original racing model street legal with mufflers, a windshield and bumpers amongst other modifications. But some things were not modified, including the racing rear end, brakes and headers. The most notable modification is the addition of Twin Paxton Superchargers, TPS.

Shelby crafted a second model, CSX 3303, from a street version. CSX 3303 was given to comedian Bill Cosby, his close friend. When Cosby attempted to drive CSX3303, he found that it was very difficult to keep under control; he later recounted the experience on his 1968 stand-up comedy album &quot;200 M.P.H.&quot;. Cosby gave the car back to Shelby, who then shipped it out to one of his company&#x27;s dealers in San Francisco, S&amp;C Ford on Van Ness Avenue. S&amp;C Ford then sold it to customer Tony Maxey. Maxey, suffering the same issues as Cosby did with the car, had his throttle stick while leaving a traffic stop, lost control and drove it off a cliff, landing in the Pacific Ocean waters.

Shelby used his CSX 3015 as a personal car over the years, sometimes entering it into local races like the Turismos Visitadores Cannonball-Run race in Nevada, where he was &quot;waking [up] whole towns, blowing out windows, throwing belts and catching fire a couple of times, but finishing.&quot; CSX3015 was auctioned on 22 January 2007, at the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Event in Scottsdale, Arizona, for $5 million (~$ in ) plus commission (£2.8 million), a record for a vehicle made in the U.S.

== Adaptations ==
(CF/CFX 01–80)

AC also produced the AC 428 Frua on a stretched Cobra 427 MK III coil spring chassis. The steel body was designed and built by Pietro Frua until 1973.

(EF/EFX 501–509)

The American Electric Car Company used an even further modified chassis for their vehicles.A singular EFX chassis was supplied to the United Kingdom with an engine and gearbox fitted.

GHIA SPYDER

(CSX 5001–5002)

One prototype chassis (CSX 3063) was shipped to Ghia in Italy in 1965 for a body styling exercise. This vehicle was first displayed during a European car show with a Cobra license tag. An article about the car was written up in the Winter 65/66 edition of &quot;Style Quarterly&quot; magazine. Shelby American internal production records show that the car was shipped to Shelby American for Evaluation and review. AC Cars Ltd internal production records show that Shelby American placed an order for two 96-inch chassis (CSX 5001–5002) in 1966. AC labeled these chassis as &quot;GHIA CONVERTIBLE&quot; in their factory ledger.

FORD XD COBRA

(CSX 3001)

Shelby American internal production records show that the car was shipped to Shelby American for evaluation and review in early 1966. The vehicle was returned to Ford and now resides in the Detroit Historical Museum.

== AutoKraft ==
Autokraft manufactured an AC 289 continuation car called the Autokraft Mk IV, basically a Mk III with a Ford V8 and Borg Warner T5 Transmission. The Mk IV also received an independent suspension.

In 1986, Autokraft (as a joint venture with Ford joining in 1987) purchased AC Cars, and produced the AC Mk IV Cobra, with a at 4,200 rpm, Ford V8, which provided a top speed of and in 5.2 seconds.

At the 1990 Geneva Salon the Lightweight version was presented: weight was down to (compared to ) and power was up to at 5,750 rpm thanks to aluminum heads, a Holley four-barrel carburettor, and no catalytic converter. While the Lightweight did not meet US federal regulations, the Mk IV did, and 480 cars of all versions were built until 1996.

== AC Car Group ==
In 1996 the company was purchased by Pride Automotive. Two new &#x27;Cobra&#x27; style cars were launched in 1997, the &#x27;Superblower&#x27;, an aluminium-bodied car with a supercharged Ford V8 providing and the cheaper &#x27;Carbon Road Series&#x27; (CRS) with a carbonfibre body and a version of the Ford V8 engine. 22 Superblowers and 37 CRSs were built between 1997 and 2001.

In 1999, a limited edition run of 25 289 FIA Cobras were planned. Only 1 example was manufactured, chassis number COB 1001.

A further variant, &#x27;the 212 S/C&#x27; with a twin-turbocharged Lotus V8 engine was introduced in 2000, but only two examples were built.

In 2001, the company relocated its factory to Frimley, Surrey. By August 2002, the company was in a financial low and briefly acquired by Private Corp, who closed operations in October 2003. Only two models were produced, a FIA 289 (COX 2610), and a 427 Cobra (COX 3361). The cars were intended to be sold in the US market, through a new company, AC Cars USA, in Florida. Both cars were numbered following where the original ledger entries left off during the 1960s.

== AC Motor Holdings Ltd ==
On 8 July 2002, a new company was formed in Malta named AC Motor Holdings and was responsible for the branding of the company.

In late 2003, the Frimley factory was under the control of AC Motor Holdings.

On 4 December 2003, Shelby and AC announced a co-production of the CSX1000 and CSX 7500 series. Only 14 CSX1000, and 2 CSX 7500 cars were built by 2007.

Between 2004 and 2007, AC Motor Holdings produced the AC Mk V in their Malta factory. However, only 3 right-hand drive and 2 left-hand drive carbon-fibre AC Mk Vs powered by Ford V8 engines were built before the Maltese operation closed.

== Acedes Holdings Llc ==
On 20 April 2008, AC announced its Heritage Series, the UK operations were granted to Brooklands Motor Company, dba AC Heritage. The US operations were granted to AC AutoKraft, Llc, of Michigan.

Both companies are licensed to produce traditional aluminum-body models: Ruddspeed, 289, and 427 continuation Aces and Cobras.

In 2009, AC licensed Gullwing GmbH in Germany, dba AC-Automotive, to produce the AC MK VI, with an aluminium coated composite body and powered by a LS3 Chevrolet engine, or a supercharged version.

In 2012, the AC Mrk II Classic was released. Available in either aluminum or fiberglass bodies.

In 2017, the AC Mrk1 260 Legacy edition was released in a limited production of nine cars. Also released was the AC 378 a newer composite body version of the Cobra.

== Shelby Daytona Coupé ==
In an effort to improve top speed along the legendary Mulsanne Straight at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, a number of enclosed, coupé variations were constructed using the leafspring chassis and running gear of the AC/Shelby Cobra Mark II. The most famous and numerous of these were the official works Shelby Daytona Cobra Coupés. Six were constructed, each being subtly different from the rest.

AC Cars also produced a Le Mans coupé. The car was a one-off and was nearly destroyed after a high-speed tyre blow-out at the 1964 Le Mans race. The car was qualified conservatively second in GT. The race started well with the AC, chassis number A98, maintaining its position in the top two in GT and even leading the class for a time. This was not to last as an act of sabotage (newspaper in the fuel tank) began to block the fuel filter. The car lost time until this was diagnosed and cleaned out. The car proceeded on at the predetermined conservative lap time and for the next stint remained trouble free. The car was able to match the Shelby Daytona&#x27;s speed despite running a higher differential ratio (2.88 instead of 3.07) and a lower state of engine tune for reliability ( instead of the Daytona&#x27;s ).

The Willment race team became interested in Shelby&#x27;s Cobra-based coupé and inquired on purchasing one. Shelby turned down the offer, but supplied the drawings to Willment. Dubbed the Willment Cobra Coupé, this car was fully built by the JWA racing team and numbered 2131 on the frame.

== 427 Super Coupé ==

A prototype (CSX 3027) was to become 427 Coupé, but since the focus was shifted towards the GT program, this project received little attention. The bodywork and chassis were soon scrapped.

Two further chassis were ordered number CSX 3054 and CSX 3055. This project was also abandoned with just CSX 3054 receiving a body. CSX 3055 was sold to the Willment Race Team and was fitted with a Fiat body designed by Ghia.

== Argentine Manufacturing ==
In 2023, Argentine entrepreneur Federico Álvarez Castillo announced that he would manufacture Big Block 427 and Small Block 289 models under official license at his plant located in Pilar, Buenos Aires. The plan is to manufacture 12 units per year with the goal of exporting them to the Latin American market.

== Counterfeit Cobras ==
In 1993, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; exposed a scheme by Shelby to counterfeit the AC Cobra. With the price of an original Cobra skyrocketing, Shelby had requested the California Department of Motor Vehicles (the government agency responsible for titling vehicles and issuing operator permits) to issue 43 duplicate titles for vehicles that did not officially exist in company records. A letter from AC Cars confirmed the fact that the chassis numbers for which Shelby had obtained titles were never manufactured, at least not by AC Cars. Only 55 Cobras had been originally produced out of a block of serial numbers reserved for 100 vehicles. Shelby had taken advantage of a loophole in the California system that allowed one to obtain a duplicate title for a vehicle with only a written declaration, without the vehicle identification number appearing in the DMV&#x27;s database or the declarant ever presenting an actual vehicle for inspection. Shelby admitted that the chassis had been manufactured in 1991 and 1992 by McCluskey Ltd, an engineering firm in Torrance, California, and were not original AC chassis, however Shelby denied having misled anyone and said he was a victim of a campaign by Brian Angliss, a British competitor, who owned AC at the time and was also building Cobras from the original tooling and wished to enhance his sales by smearing Shelby&#x27;s car.

== Continuation Cars ==

Since the late 1980s onwards, various companies have built what are known in the hobby as &quot;Continuation Cars&quot;.

Shelby authorized continuations of the original AC-built Cobra series. Produced in Las Vegas, Nevada, these cars retain the general style and appearance of their original 1960s ancestors, but are fitted with modern amenities. The initial version for continuation was a 427 S/C model which was represented in the CSX4000 series. This was meant to continue where the last 427 S/C production left off, at approximately serial number CSX3360 in the 1960s.

The initial CSX4000 series cars were completed from the chassis built by Mike McCluskey with NOS and reconditioned parts. Based in Torrance, Calif., McCluskey had been Shelby’s personal mechanic since the 1960s and was a well-established restorer and fabricator. Given the value of the vehicle many &quot;extra&quot; cars have appeared over the years, even some sharing the same chassis number. Gradually as the vintage parts supply ran low, newly constructed frames and body panels were obtained from a variety of suppliers. The production of chassis numbers CSX4001 to CSX4999 took roughly 20 years and many different business relationships to complete.

In 2009, CSX4999 was produced, concluding the 4000 series. Production has continued with the CSX6000 serial numbers, featuring &quot;coil over&quot; suspension.

The 289 FIA &quot;leaf spring&quot; race version of the car is reproduced as CSX7000, and the original &quot;slab side&quot; leaf spring street car is the CSX8000 series. The Daytona Coupé is reproduced as the CSX 9000 series.

To date most continuations are produced in fiberglass, with some ordering cars with aluminium or carbon-fibre bodywork.

In 2004, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Ford unveiled a concept for a modernized AC Cobra. The Ford Shelby Cobra Concept was a continuation of Ford&#x27;s effort to bring back the retro sports cars that had been successful in the 1960s, including the Ford GT40 and the fifth generation Ford Mustang.

In 2014, Shelby American announced a limited edition production of 50 cars for the 50th anniversary of the original 427 Shelby Cobra.

During the continuation period, Kirkham Motorsports were contracted by Shelby to produce rolling Cobra body/chassis units but this did not end amicably. Pete Brock said in a Hot Rod magazine interview &quot;Like the Kirkhams, even when they were supplying most of Shelby’s Cobra parts. Shelby would go to them and say he would buy their entire year’s worth of production and sign a contract. They called me and asked if they should do it and I said, &quot;As long as you get the money up front, but if you let a car out the door, you&#x27;ll lose money.&quot; Shelby paid that way for two years and then finally [Kirkhams] got a great big order and Shelby&#x27;s truck driver said he forgot to bring the check. He went back with a bunch of cars on the transporter and Shelby told them he wasn&#x27;t going to pay them—that they owed it to him. That almost put [Kirkhams] out of business.&quot;

<doc id="236625" wikidata="Q131487" url="?curid=236625" title="Karl Adolph Gjellerup">
<text>Karl Adolph Gjellerup (; 2 June 1857 – 11 October 1919) was a Danish poet and novelist who together with his compatriot Henrik Pontoppidan won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1917. He is associated with the Modern Breakthrough period of Scandinavian literature. He occasionally used the pseudonym Epigonos.

==Biography==

===Youth and debut===
Gjellerup was the son of a vicar in Zealand who died when his son was three years. Karl Gjellerup was raised then by the uncle of Johannes Fibiger, he grew up in a national and romantic idealistic atmosphere. In the 1870s he broke with his background and at first he became an enthusiastic supporter of the naturalist movement and Georg Brandes, writing audacious novels about free love and atheism. Strongly influenced by his origin he gradually left the Brandes line and 1885 he broke totally with the naturalists, becoming a new romanticist. A central trace of his life was his Germanophile attitude, he felt himself strongly attracted to German culture (his wife was a German) and 1892 he finally settled in Germany, which made him unpopular in Denmark on both the right and left wing. As years passed he totally identified with the German Empire, including its war aims 1914–18.

Among the early works of Gjellerup must be mentioned his most important novel (1882, i.e. &quot;The Germans&#x27; Apprentice&quot;), a partly autobiographic tale of the development of a young man from being a conformist theologian to a pro-German atheist and intellectual, and (1889), on the surface, a love story but more of a study in woman&#x27;s psychology. Some Wagnerian dramas show his growing romanticist interests. An important work is the novel (1896, i. e. &quot;The Mill&quot;), a sinister melodrama of love and jealousy.

===Later years===
In his last years he was clearly influenced by Buddhism and Oriental culture. His critically acclaimed work / (1906, i.e. &quot;The Pilgrim Kamanita&quot;) has been called &#x27;one of the oddest novels written in Danish&#x27;. It features the journey of Kamanita, an Indian merchant&#x27;s son, from earthly prosperity and carnal romance, through the ups and downs of the world&#x27;s way, a chance meeting with a stranger monk (who, unbeknownst to Kamanita, was actually Gautama Buddha), death, and reincarnation towards nirvana. In Thailand, which is a Buddhist country, the Thai translation of &quot;The Pilgrim Kamanita&quot; co-translated by Phraya Anuman Rajadhon was formerly used as part of the school textbooks.

 (1907, i.e. &quot;The wife of the perfect&quot;) is a versified drama, inspired by Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, about Buddha&#x27;s earthly life as Siddharta, being inhibited in his spiritual efforts by his wife, Yasodhara. The giant novel (1910, i.e. &quot;The world roamers&quot;) takes its contemporary starting point in a German female academic on a study tour in India, but evolves across chronological levels, in which characters re-experience what has happened in former eons, thus featuring souls roaming from one incarnation to another.

 (1913, i.e. &quot;The country practice of [physician] Rudolph Sten&quot;) is set in the rural Zealand of Gjellerup&#x27;s youth. The main character develops from a liberal, superficial outlook on life, including youthful romantical conflicts, through years of reflection and ascetic devotion to duty towards a more mature standpoint, hinting at the author&#x27;s own course of life.

 (1919, i.e. &quot;The holiest animal&quot;) was Gjellerup&#x27;s last work. Having elements of self-parody, it is regarded as his only attempt at humour. It is a peculiar mythological satire in which animals arrive at their own Elysium after death. These include the snake that killed Cleopatra, Odysseus&#x27; dog Argos, Wisvamitra (the holy cow of India), the donkey of Jesus and the horses of various historical commanders in field. The assembly select, after discussion, Buddha&#x27;s horse Kantaka as the holiest of animals, but it has left without a trace to follow its master to nirvana.

==Aftermath==
In Denmark, Gjellerup&#x27;s Nobel award was received with little enthusiasm. He had long been regarded as a German writer. During various stages of his career, he had made himself unpopular with both the naturalist left surrounding Georg Brandes and the conservative right. Gjellerup&#x27;s nomination for the Nobel prize did nevertheless receive Danish support. Because Sweden was neutral during World War I, the divided prize did not arouse political speculations about partial decision, but showed on the other hand allegiance between the Nordic neighbors.

Today Gjellerup is almost forgotten in Denmark. In spite of this, however, literary historians normally regard him as an honest seeker after truth.

Gjellerup&#x27;s works have been translated into several languages, including German (often translated by himself), Swedish, English, Dutch, Polish, Thai and others. &quot;The Pilgrim Kamanita&quot; is his most widely translated book, having been published in several European countries and the United States. In Thailand, a Buddhist country, the first half of the Thai translation of &quot;Kamanita&quot; have been used in secondary school textbooks.

<text>Ta&#x27;xet is the Haida god of violent death. He is considered to be one half of a duality; his counterpart is Tia, the goddess of peaceful death.

==Folklore==
According to Haidan folklore, the raven stole the Moon from Ta&#x27;xet during Earth&#x27;s creation and placed it in the sky to nourish humanity. If humanity was to ever displease the raven by altering the Earth&#x27;s environment, he will return the Moon to Ta&#x27;xet and stop protecting humanity from Ta&#x27;xet&#x27;s wrath. In folklore, it is also said that the souls of those who meet a violent death go to Ta&#x27;xet&#x27;s house without a warning, while Tia leaves signs before she takes her victims.

<doc id="236629" wikidata="Q9364135" url="?curid=236629" title="USS Keokuk (1862)">
<text>USS &quot;Keokuk&quot; was an experimental ironclad screw steamer of the United States Navy named for the city of Keokuk, Iowa. She was laid down in New York City by designer Charles W. Whitney at J.S. Underhill Shipbuilders, at the head of 11th Street. She was originally named &quot;Moodna&quot; (sometimes incorrectly spelled &quot;Woodna&quot;), but was renamed while under construction, launched in December 1862 sponsored by Mrs. C. W. Whitney, wife of the builder, and commissioned in early March 1863 with Commander Alexander C. Rhind in command.

==Design==
&quot;Keokuk&quot; was one of the first warships to be of completely iron construction, with wood used only for deck planks and filler in the armor cladding. Her hull construction consisted of five iron box keelsons and one hundred 1-inch-thick (some sources report the thickness as 3/4 inch) by 4-inch-deep iron frames spaced 18 inches between centers. The frames included integral iron cross beams for the decks, with no transverse wood timbers as used on the &quot;Monitor&quot;. Her bow and stern sections were flooding spaces to allow raising and lowering her waterline.

Her two stationary, conical gun towers, each pierced with three gun ports, housed one 11-inch Dahlgren shell gun each on a shortened and rounded rotating wooden slide carriage (the tower shape often causing her to be mistaken for a double-turreted monitor). Her tower and casemate armor was made up from 1-inch-thick by 4-inch-deep horizontal iron bars alternating with planks of yellow pine of the same dimensions, sheathed with layers of overlapping, flush-bolted -inch rolled iron plates. A total thickness of this composite armor, including the hull skin proper, was 5.75 inches (146 mm). The deck was made of 5-inch wood planks overlaid with -inch-thick iron plate. She had two twin-cylinder main propulsion engines, each 250 hp. In total, &quot;Keokuk&quot; had nine steam engines providing power to various systems.

==Service history==

The new ironclad departed New York on March 11, 1863 and steamed south to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron for the attack on Charleston, South Carolina, and arrived at Newport News, Virginia, two days later. She got underway again on March 17 but returned to Hampton Roads for repairs when her port propeller became fouled in a buoy anchor line. She stood out of Hampton Roads again on March 22 and arrived at Port Royal, South Carolina on March 26. A soldier who saw the &quot;Keokuk&quot; wrote of her in a letter home: &quot;...The iron clad battery Keokuk steamed by me yesterday and I have heard that she was bound to Charleston S.C. It was a curious looking affair I assure you it had two turrets with two guns [sic] in each. It looked a little like this [reasonably accurate sketch in letter] but of course I am not an artist...&quot;

As the day of attack on Charleston approached, &quot;Keokuk&quot; and were busy laying buoys to guide Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont&#x27;s ironclad flotilla, which included , seven monitors (&quot;Weehawken&quot;, &quot;Passaic&quot;, &quot;Montauk&quot;, &quot;Patapsco&quot;, &quot;Catskill&quot;, &quot;Nantucket&quot;, and &quot;Nahant&quot;), and &quot;Keokuk&quot;, into the strongly fortified Confederate harbor. The Union ships crossed the Stono Bar on April 6 but were prevented from attacking that day by hazy weather which obscured targets and blinded pilots.

The First Battle of Charleston Harbor began at noon on April 7, but difficulties in clearing torpedoes from the path of Du Pont&#x27;s ironclads slowed their progress. Shortly after 3 p.m., they came within range of Fort Moultrie and Fort Sumter; and the battle began. Southern obstructions and a strong flood tide made the ironclads virtually unmanageable, while accurate fire from the forts played upon them at will. With the Union formation scrambled, &quot;Keokuk&quot; was compelled to run ahead of crippled to avoid her in the narrow channel after &quot;Nahant&quot;″s pilot was killed and helmsman wounded by a Confederate shot striking the pilothouse. This brought her less than 600 yards (550 m) from Fort Sumter, where she remained for half an hour receiving the undivided attention of the Confederate cannons.
&quot;Keokuk&quot; was struck by about ninety projectiles, many of which hit at or below her waterline. Commander Rhind reported his ship as being hit by a combination of solid shot, bolts, and possibly heated shot. As predicted by her chief engineer, her thin composite armor was completely inadequate to protect her from this onslaught and she was &quot;completely riddled&quot; in the words of Commander Rhind. However, she was able to withdraw under her own power and anchor out of range, thanks in part to the skills of her Black pilot, Robert Smalls, a former slave and pilot of CSS &quot;Planter&quot;. Her crew kept her afloat through the night, but when a breeze came up on the morning of April 8, 1863, &quot;Keokuk&quot; began taking on more water, filled rapidly, and sank off Morris Island. She had given one month of commissioned service. One of &quot;Keokuk&quot;&#x27;s sailors, Quartermaster Robert Anderson, was awarded the Medal of Honor in part for his actions during the battle. In all, 14 of &quot;Keokuk&quot;″s crew were injured in the battle, including Captain Rhind with a contusion to his leg. Acting Ensign Mackintosh, one of the gun captains, later died from his wounds.

== Salvage of &quot;Keokuk&quot; guns ==

A Federal survey of the wreck shortly after the battle determined that the &quot;Keokuk&quot; could not be refloated or destroyed, as she was almost completely filled with sand. The two 11-inch Dahlgren guns could be easily replaced from stockpiles and were abandoned as unsalvageable.

To Confederate forces, these two guns represented an opportunity to obtain badly needed artillery. The Confederacy possessed only 150 to 200 naval and coastal defense guns, none of them as large as the sunken Dahlgrens. P.G.T. Beauregard, commander of the Charleston defenses, authorized an immediate salvage operation led by a civilian, Adolphus W. LaCoste. A modified lightship, &quot;Rattlesnake Shoals&quot;, was towed into place as a salvage platform. To avoid attracting the attention of Union forces, work was done at night, during low tide, with the Confederate ironclads &quot;Palmetto State&quot; and &quot;Chicora&quot; providing protection. The Union did not suspect this activity until it was announced in the Charleston &quot;Mercury&quot; after the guns were recovered.

The &quot;Keokuk&quot; guns served the Confederacy for the remainder of the war. One was destroyed, probably during the evacuation of Charleston in 1865. The other gun tube can still be seen on the Charleston waterfront at White Point Garden, mounted on an incorrect iron fortress carriage. In the image, the &quot;Keokuk&quot; gun is in the background.

<text>Carl Friedrich Georg Spitteler (24 April 1845 – 29 December 1924) was a Swiss poet who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1919 &quot;in special appreciation of his epic &quot;Olympian Spring&quot;&quot;. His work includes both pessimistic and heroic poems.

==Biography==
Spitteler was born in Liestal. His father was an official of the government, being Federal Secretary of the Treasury from 1849 to 1856. Young Spitteler attended the gymnasium at Basel, having among his teachers philologist Wilhelm Wackernagel and historian Jacob Burckhardt. From 1863 he studied law at the University of Zurich. In 1865–1870 he studied theology in the same institution, at Heidelberg and Basel, though when a position as pastor was offered him, he felt that he must decline it. He had begun to realize his mission as an epic poet and therefore refused to work in the field for which he had prepared himself.

Later he worked in Russia as tutor, starting from August 1871, remaining there (with some periods in Finland) until 1879. Later he was elementary teacher in Bern and La Neuveville, as well as journalist for the &quot;Der Kunstwart&quot; and as editor for the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot;. In 1883 Spitteler married Marie op der Hoff, previously his pupil in Neuveville.

Under the pseudonym Carl Felix Tandem, Spitteler published the allegoric prose poem &quot;Prometheus and Epimetheus&quot; in 1881, contrasting between ideals and dogmas through the mythological figures of Prometheus and Epimetheus. This 1881 edition received an extended psychological exegesis by Carl Gustav Jung in his 1921 book &quot;Psychological Types&quot;. Spitteler later reworked the poem as &quot;Prometheus der Dulder&quot; (&quot;Prometheus the Sufferer&quot;), published in 1924 under his true name.

In 1882 he published his &quot;Extramundana&quot;, a collection of poems. He gave up teaching in 1885 and devoted himself to a journalistic career in Basel. Now his works began to come in rapid succession. In 1891 there appeared &quot;Friedli, der Kalderi&quot;, a collection of short stories, in which Spitteler, as he himself says, depicted Russian realism. &quot;Literarische Gleichnisse&quot; appeared in 1892, and &quot;Balladen&quot; in 1896.

In 1900–1905 Spitteler wrote the powerful allegoric-epic poem, in iambic hexameters, &quot;Olympischer Frühling&quot; (&quot;Olympic Spring&quot;). This work, mixing fantastic, naturalistic, religions and mythological themes, deals with human concern towards the universe. His prose works include &quot;Die Mädchenfeinde &quot;(&quot;Two Little Misogynists&quot;, 1907), about his autobiographical childhood experiences, the dramatic &quot;Conrad der Leutnant &quot;(1898), in which he show influence from the previously opposed Naturalism, and the autobiographical novella &quot;Imago&quot; (1906), examining the role of the unconscious in the conflict between a creative mind and the middle-class restrictions with internal monologue.

During World War I he opposed the pro-German attitude of the Swiss German-speaking majority, a position put forward in the essay &quot;Unser Schweizer Standpunkt&quot;. In 1919 he won the Nobel Prize. Spitteler died at Lucerne in 1924.

Carl Spitteler&#x27;s estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern, in the Zürich Central Library and in the Dichter- und Stadtmuseum in Liestal.

==In popular culture==
Carl Jung claimed his idea of the archetype of the Anima was based upon what Spitteler described as &#x27;My Lady Soul&#x27;. Musician David Bowie, who famously described himself as Jungian, wrote the 1973 song &quot;Lady Grinning Soul&quot;.

<doc id="236637" wikidata="Q207303" url="?curid=236637" title="Stefan Dušan">
<text>[[Stephen (honorific)|Stefan]] Uroš IV Dušan (), also known as Dušan the Mighty ( – 20 December 1355), was the King of Serbia from 8 September 1331 and Emperor of the Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians and Albanians from 16 April 1346 until his death in 1355. Dušan is considered one of the greatest medieval Balkan conquerors.

Dušan conquered a large part of southeast Europe, becoming one of the most powerful monarchs of the era. Under Dušan&#x27;s rule, Serbia was the most powerful state in Southeast Europe and one of the most powerful European states. It was an Eastern Orthodox, multi-ethnic, and multilingual empire that stretched from the Danube in the north to the Gulf of Corinth in the south, with its capital in Skopje. He enacted the constitution of the Serbian Empire, known as Dušan Code, perhaps the most important literary work of medieval Serbia. Dušan promoted the Serbian Church from an archbishopric to a patriarchate, finished the construction of the Visoki Dečani Monastery (now a UNESCO site), and founded the monastery of the Holy Archangels, among others. Under his rule, Serbia reached its territorial, political, economic, and cultural peak.

Stefan Dušan worked to forge a coalition with Venice to address the advancing threat of the Ottoman Turks into Europe. However, his efforts were interrupted by his sudden death in December 1355 at his court in Prizren. After his death, the Serbian Empire began to weaken significantly. With the death of Dušan&#x27;s successor, Emperor Stefan Uroš V, the empire was definitively divided into numerous independent Serbian states, marking what is historically referred to as the Fall of the Serbian Empire. He was originally buried in his foundation near Prizren, but his remains were later relocated to the Church of Saint Mark in Belgrade, where they rest to this day. 

==Background==
In 1314, Serbian King Stefan Milutin quarreled with his son, Stefan Dečanski. Milutin sent Dečanski to Constantinople to have him blinded, though he was never totally blinded. Dečanski wrote to Danilo, the bishop of Hum, asking him to intervene with his father. Danilo wrote to Archbishop Nicodemus of Serbia, who spoke with Milutin and persuaded him to recall his son. In 1320 Dečanski was permitted to return to Serbia and was given the appanage of &#x27;Budimlje&#x27; (modern Berane), while his half-brother, Stefan Konstantin, held the province of Zeta.

Milutin became ill and died on 29 October 1321, and Konstantin was crowned king. Civil war erupted immediately, as Dečanski and his cousin, Stefan Vladislav II, claimed the throne. Konstantin refused to submit to Dečanski, who then invaded Zeta, defeating and killing Konstantin. Dečanski was crowned king on 6 January 1322 by Nicodemus, and his son, Stefan Dušan, was crowned &quot;young king&quot;. Dečanski later granted Zeta to Dušan, indicating him as the intended heir. Since April 1326 Dušan appears in written sources as the &quot;young king&quot; and ruler in Zeta and Zahumlje. From that fact and the &quot;Old Serbian genealogies and annals&quot;, in recent works, some Serbian historians write that Dušan was 14 years old probably in March, or April 1326, and that he was born in 1312, not around 1308.

In the meantime, Vladislav II mobilized local support from Rudnik, the former appanage of his father, Stefan Dragutin. Vladislav proclaimed himself king, and he was supported by the Hungarians, consolidating control over his lands and preparing for battle with Dečanski. As was the case with their fathers, Serbia was divided by the two independent rulers; in 1322 and 1323 Ragusan merchants freely visited both lands.

In 1323, war broke out between Dečanski and Vladislav. Rudnik had fallen to Dečanski by the end of 1323, and Vladislav appeared to have fled north. Vladislav was defeated in battle in late 1324 and fled to Hungary, leaving the Serbian throne to Dečanski as undisputed &quot;king of All Serbian and Maritime lands&quot;.

==Biography==
===Youth and usurpation===
Dušan was the eldest son of King Stefan Dečanski and Theodora Smilets, the daughter of emperor Smilets of Bulgaria. He was born , or in 1312, in Serbia. In 1314 Dušan&#x27;s father was exiled, and the family lived in Constantinople until his recall in 1320. Dušan became acquainted with the Byzantine Empire during his stay in its capital, learning cultural customs and the Greek language. He was interested in the arts of war; in his youth he fought exceptionally in two battles, defeating Bosnian forces in 1329 during the War of Hum, and the Bulgarian emperor Michael III Shishman in the 1330 Battle of Velbužd. Dečanski appointed his nephew Ivan Stephen (through Anna Neda) to the throne of Bulgaria in August 1330.

Dečanski&#x27;s decision not to attack the Byzantines after the victory at Velbazhd, when he had an opportunity, resulted in the alienation of many nobles, who sought to expand to the south. By January or February 1331, Dušan was quarreling with his father, perhaps pressured by the nobility. According to contemporary pro-Dušan sources, advisors turned Dečanski against his son, and he decided to seize and exclude Dušan from his inheritance. Dečanski sent an army into Zeta against his son; the army ravaged Skadar, but Dušan had crossed the Bojana river. A brief period of anarchy took place in parts of Serbia before father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Dečanski ordered Dušan to meet him. Dušan feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Dušan marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where he besieged his father. Dečanski fled, and Dušan captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at Petrich. On 21 August 1331 Dečanski surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Dušan&#x27;s advisors, he was imprisoned. Dušan was crowned &quot;King of All Serbian and Maritime lands&quot; in the first week of September.

===Personal traits===
Contemporary writers described Dušan as unusually tall and strong, &quot;the tallest man of his time&quot;, very handsome, and a rare leader full of dynamism, quick intelligence, and strength, bearing &quot;a kingly presence&quot;. According to contemporary depictions, he had dark hair and brown eyes; in adult age he grew a beard and longer hair.

===Early reign===

Serbia made some raids into the Macedonia region in late 1331, but a planned major attack on Byzantium was delayed as Dušan had to suppress revolts in Zeta in 1332. Dušan&#x27;s ingratitude toward those who had aided his rise – the Zetan nobility may have been neglected their promised reward and greater influence – may have been the cause of the rebellion, which was suppressed in the course of the same year.

The struggle between Dušan and Stefan Dečanski prevented Serbian intervention in Bulgaria on behalf of Anna and Ivan Stephen and they were overthrown by Ivan Alexander in March 1331, however Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria was aware of future danger from Serbia and immediately sought peace with Dušan. The two rulers concluded peace and formed an alliance, sealed with Dušan&#x27;s marriage to Ivan Alexander&#x27;s sister Helen of Bulgaria. Good relations with Bulgaria continued during Dušan&#x27;s reign and though Bulgaria was weaker then Serbia, it did not suffer any legal dependence.

In 1333 after negotiations with Ragusa, Dušan sold Ston and its envisions, including the Pelješac peninsula and the coastland between Ston and Dubrovnik for eight thousand perpers and an annual tribute of five hundred perpers, the so-called tribute of Ston. Ragusa also had to guarantee freedom of worship for Orthodox believers in this territory.

Dušan began campaigning against the Byzantine Empire in late 1333, when Syrgiannes, a leading Byzantine general, requested Serbian assistance in his revolt against Andronikos III. The Serbs attacked Byzantine Macedonia in the spring of 1334; Syrgiannes contributed his strategic abilities and knowledge of Byzantine positions, and his allies surrendered fortresses to the invaders. Peace was concluded on 26 August 1334, with the Byzantines recognizing Serbian gains in Ohrid, Prilep, Strumitsa, Siderokastron, Chermen and Prosek. Meanwhile Charles I of Hungary, supported by Stephen II of Bosnia, mobilized to attack Serbia from the north. Knowing of Dušan&#x27;s involvement in the south and not expecting any serious resistance, they penetrated deep into Serbia, reaching the neighborhood of Žiča monastery. Dušan marched north to face the invaders, who quickly withdrew. Charles I was wounded by an arrow but survived. As a result, the Hungarians lost Mačva and Belgrade in 1335. Dušan then focused his attention on the internal affairs of his country, writing, in 1349, the first statute book of the Serbs.

Dušan exploited the civil war in the Byzantine Empire between the regent of the minor Emperor John V Palaiologos, Anna of Savoy, and his father&#x27;s general John Kantakouzenos. Dušan and Ivan Alexander picked opposite sides in the conflict but remained at peace with each other, taking advantage of the Byzantine civil war to secure gains for themselves.

Dušan&#x27;s systematic offensive began in 1342, and in the end he conquered all Byzantine territories in the western Balkans as far as Kavala, except for the Peloponnesus and Thessaloniki, which he could not besiege due to his small fleet. There has been speculation that Dušan&#x27;s ultimate goal was no less than to conquer Constantinople and replace the declining Byzantine Empire with a united Orthodox Greco-Serbian Empire under his control. In May 1344, his commander Preljub was stopped at Stephaniana by a Turkic force of 3,100. The Turks won the battle, but the victory was not enough to thwart the Serbian conquest of Macedonia. Faced with Dušan&#x27;s aggression, the Byzantines sought allies in the Ottoman Turks, whom they brought into Europe for the first time.

In 1343, Dušan added &quot;of Romans&quot; to his self-styled title &quot;King of Serbia, Albania and the coast&quot; (&quot;Romans&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Greeks&quot; in Serbian documents). In another instance, in a charter issued to the fortified city of Krujë, Dušan referred to himself as &quot;King of the Bulgarians&quot;. In 1345 he began calling himself &quot;tsar&quot;, equivalent of Emperor, as attested in charters to two athonite monasteries, one from November 1345 and the other from January 1346, and around Christmas 1345 at a council meeting in Serres, which had been conquered on 25 September 1345, he proclaimed himself &quot;Tsar of the Serbs and Romans&quot;.

===Imperial coronation and autocephaly of the Serbian church===

On 16 April 1346 (Easter), Dušan convoked a huge assembly at Skopje, attended by the Serbian Archbishop Joanikije II, the Archbishop of Ochrid Nikolas I, the Bulgarian Patriarch Simeon, and various religious leaders of Mount Athos. The assembly and clerics agreed upon, and then ceremonially performed, the raising of the autocephalous Serbian Archbishopric to the status of Serbian Patriarchate. The Archbishop from then on was titled Serbian Patriarch, although some documents called him &quot;Patriarch of Serbs and Romans&quot;, with the seat at the Monastery of Peć. The first Serbian Patriarch Joanikije II solemnly crowned Dušan as &quot;Emperor and autocrat of Serbs and Romans&quot; (Greek ). Dušan had his son Uroš crowned &quot;King of Serbs and Greeks&quot;, giving him nominal rule over the &quot;Serbian lands&quot;, and although Dušan was governing the whole state, he had special responsibility for the Eastern &quot;Roman&quot; lands.
A further increase in the Byzantinization of the Serbian court followed, particularly in court ceremonial and titles. As Emperor, Dušan could grant titles only possible as an Emperor. In the years that followed, Dušan&#x27;s half-brother Symeon Uroš and brother-in-law Jovan Asen became &quot;despotes&quot;. Jovan Oliver already had the despot title, granted to him by Andronikos III. His brother-in-law Dejan Dragaš and Branko Mladenović were granted the title of &quot;sebastocrator&quot;. The military commanders (&quot;voivodes&quot;) Preljub and Vojihna received the title of &quot;caesar&quot;. The raising of the Serbian Patriarch resulted in the same spirit as bishoprics became metropolitans, as for example the Metropolitanate of Skopje.

The Serbian Patriarchate took over sovereignty on Mt. Athos and the Greek eparchies under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, while the Archbishopric of Ohrid remained autocephalous. For those acts he was excommunicated by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in 1350.

===Epirus and Thessaly===
In 1347, Dušan conquered Epirus, Aetolia and Acarnania, appointing his half-brother, despot Simeon Uroš, as governor of those provinces. In 1348, Dušan also conquered Thessaly, appointing Preljub as governor. In eastern regions of Macedonia, he appointed Vojihna as governor of Drama. Once Dušan conquered Byzantine possessions in western regions, he sought to obtain Constantinople. To acquire the city, he needed a fleet. Knowing that fleets of southern Serbian Dalmatian towns were not strong enough to overcome Constantinople, he opened negotiations with Venice, with which he maintained fairly good relations. Venice feared a reduction of privileges in the Empire if Serbs became the masters of Constantinople over the weakened Byzantines. But had the Venetians allied with Serbia, Dušan would have examined existing privileges. Once he became master of all Byzantine lands (especially Thessalonika and Constantinople) the Venetians would have gained privileges. But Venice chose to avoid a military alliance. While Dušan sought Venetian aid against Byzantium, the Venetians sought Serbian support in the struggle against the Hungarians over Dalmatia. Sensing that Serbian aid would result in a Venetian obligation to Serbia, Venice politely turned down Dušan&#x27;s offers of help.
While Dušan launched the Bosnian campaign (with the troops previously based in Macedonia and Thessaly), Kantakouzenos tried to regain lands Byzantium had lost. In his support, the Constantinopolitan patriarch Kallistos excommunicated Dušan to discourage the Greek population in Dušan&#x27;s Greek provinces from supporting the Serbian administration and thereby assist the Kantakouzenos campaign. The excommunication did not stop Dušan&#x27;s relations with Mount Athos, which still addressed him as Emperor, though rather as &quot;Emperor of Serbs&quot; than &quot;Emperor of Serbs and Greeks&quot;.

Kantakouzenos raised a small army and took the Chalcidic peninsula, then Veria and Voden. Veria was the richest town in the Bottiaea region. Dušan had earlier replaced many Greeks with Serbs, including a Serb garrison. However, the remaining locals were able to open the gates for Kantakouzenos in 1350. Voden resisted Kantakouzenos but was taken by assault. Kantakouzenos then marched toward Thessaly, but was stopped at Servia by &quot;Caesar&quot; Preljub and his army of 500 men. The Byzantine force retired to Veria, and the aiding Turk contingent went off plundering, reaching Skopje. Once the news of the Byzantine campaign reached Dušan in Hum, he quickly reassembled his forces from Bosnia and Hum and marched for Thessaly.

When Stefan Dušan reached Macedonia, the Byzantine forces withdrew to Thrace. Dušan retook Voden after a short siege, soon retaking Veria and other territories that Kantakouzenos had taken.

===War with the Bosnian banate===

Dušan evidently wanted to expand his rule over the provinces that had earlier been in the hands of Serbia, such as Hum, which was annexed by Bosnian Ban Stephen II Kotromanić in 1326. In 1329, the Ban launched an attack on Lord Vitomir, who held Travunia and Konavle. The Bosnian army was defeated at Pribojska Banja by Dušan, still &quot;Young King&quot;. The Ban soon took over Nevesinje and the rest of Bosnia. Petar Toljenović, the Lord of &quot;seaside Hum&quot; and a distant relative of Dušan, sparked a rebellion against the new ruler, but he was soon captured and died in prison.

In 1350, Dušan attacked Bosnia, seeking to regain the previously lost land of Hum and stop raids on his tributaries at Konavle. Venice sought a settlement between the two, but failed. In October, he invaded Hum, with an army said to be of 80,000 men, and successfully occupied part of the disputed territory. According to Orbini, Dušan had secretly been in contact with various Bosnian nobles, offering them bribes for support. Many nobles, chiefly of Hum, were ready to betray the Ban, such as the Nikolić family, which was kin to the Nemanjić dynasty. The Ban avoided any major confrontation and did not meet Dušan in battle; he instead retired to the mountains and made small hit-and-run actions. Most of Bosnia&#x27;s fortresses held out, but some nobles submitted to Dušan. The Serbs ravaged much of the countryside. With one army they reached Duvno and Cetina; a second army reached Krka, on which lay Knin (modern Croatia); and a third army took Imotski and Novi, where they left garrisons and entered Hum. From this position of strength, Dušan tried to negotiate peace with the Ban, sealing it by the marriage of Dušan&#x27;s son Uroš with Stephen&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth, who would receive Hum as her dowry – restoring it to Serbia. The Ban was not willing to consider this proposal.

Dušan may have also launched the campaign to aid his sister, Jelena, who married Mladen III Šubić of Klis, Omiš and Skradin, in 1347. Mladen died from Black Death (bubonic plague) in 1348, and Jelena sought to maintain the rule of the cities for herself and her son. She was challenged by Hungary and Venice, so the dispatch of Serbian troops to western Hum and Croatia may have been for her aid, as operations in this region were unlikely to help Dušan conquer Hum. If Dušan had intended to aid Jelena, rising trouble in the East precluded this. In 1335, Pope Clement VI demanded that Dušan stop the persecution of Catholics and return monasteries, churches, islands and villages taken by his predecessors to the bishop of Kotor, responsible for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trebinje.

===Last years and Death===
In 1354, Dušan was attacked by the Hungarians. They occupied part of northern Serbia. At this point, Dušan began corresponding with the pope, stating that he was ready to recognize papal supremacy. Since there is no other evidence that Dušan was seriously attracted to Catholicism, this was most likely a diplomatic action to improve relations with papacy while Serbia was endangered by Hungary. Dušan successfully repelled the Hungarian invasion, preserving or even extending his original borders in the north. When the Hungarians retreated from Serbia, he did not continue the correspondence with the pope. Peace with Louis I of Hungary was concluded in May of 1355. Dušan had grand intentions to capture Constantinople, and to place himself at the head of a grand crusading army to drive the Muslim Turks from Europe. His premature death created a large power vacuum in the Balkans, that ultimately enabled Turkish invasion and their dominance over the Balkans until the early 20th century. While mounting a crusade against the Turks, he suddenly died on 20 December 1355. He was buried in his foundation, the Monastery of the Holy Archangels near Prizren.

His empire slowly crumbled. His son and successor Stefan Uroš V could not keep the integrity of the Empire intact for long, as several feudal families immensely increased their power, though nominally acknowledging Uroš V as Emperor. Simeon Uroš, Dušan&#x27;s half-brother, had proclaimed himself Emperor after the death of Dušan, ruling a large area of Thessaly and Epirus, which he had received from Dušan.

Today Dušan&#x27;s remains are located in the Church of Saint Mark in Belgrade. Dušan is the only monarch of the Nemanjić dynasty who has not been canonised as a saint.

==Religious activity==
Much like his ancestors, Dušan was very active in renovating churches and monasteries, and also in founding new ones. First, he cared for the monasteries in which his parents were buried. Both the Banjska monastery, built by King Milutin, where his mother was buried, and the monastery of Visoki Dečani, an endowment of his father, were generously looked after. The monastery was built for eight years and it is certain that Dušan&#x27;s role in the building process was huge. Between 1337 and 1339, Dušan became ill, and he gave his word that if he survived, he would build a church and monastery in Jerusalem. At the time, there was one Serbian monastery in Jerusalem, dedicated to Archangel Michael (believed to be founded by King Milutin), and a number of Serbian monks at the Sinai Peninsula.

His greatest endowment was the Saint Archangels Monastery, located near the town of Prizren, in which he was originally buried. Dušan gave many possessions to this monastery, including the forest of Prizren which was supposed to be a special property of the monastery where all precious goods and relics were to be stored.

His son, Stefan Uroš V, did not make peace with the Constantinopolitan Patriarch. The first initiative was made by &quot;despot&quot; Uglješa Mrnjavčević in 1368, which resulted in the areas under his rule being restored to Constantinople. The final initiative for reconciliation between the two churches came from Prince Lazar in 1375. There is no evidence of an existing cult of Emperor Dušan in the decades after his death. His charter to Ragusa (Dubrovnik) served as a statute in the future trade between Serbia and Ragusa, and its regulations were deemed inviolable. His legacy was esteemed in Ragusa. Later folk tradition in Serbia included various attitudes toward Dušan, mostly negative, made under the influence of the church.

===Church policy===
Dušan rejected Constantinople&#x27;s claims to authority over the Serbian Orthodox Church and contemplated a religious union with the Latin Church. In 1354, Dušan reached out to the Papal States, offering to recognise Pope Innocent VI as the &quot;father of all Christians&quot; and to solidify a union between the Catholic and Serbian Orthodox Church, in exchange for supporting Dušan in his plans for a military crusade against the Turks. Dušan&#x27;s plans were welcomed, however such plans never materialized due to his death in 1355.

With the raising of the Serbian Archbishopric to a Patriarchate, serious changes in the organization of the church followed. Joanikije II became Patriarch. Bishoprics (Eparchies) were raised to Metropolitanates, and new territories of the Ochrid Archbishopric and Ecumenical Constantinople were added to the jurisdiction of the Serbian church. The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople had Dušan excommunicated in 1350, although this did not affect the religious organization.

Under Serbian jurisdiction came one of the foremost centers of spirituality – Mount Athos. As of November 1345, Athonite monks accepted his supreme rule, and Dušan guaranteed autonomy, also giving a row of economic privileges, with tremendous gifts and endowments. The monks of Chilandar (the cradle of the Serbian church, founded by Saint Sava, Dušan&#x27;s ancestor) came at the front of the ecclesiastical community.

In his codex, Dušan accentuates his role as a protector of Christianity and points out the independence of the church. From the codex we can also see care that the parishes are equally arranged both in cities and villages. He also took care of the few churches and monasteries from Bari in the west to Jerusalem in the east.

Besides Orthodox Christians, there were many Catholics in the Empire, mostly in the coastal cities of Cattaro, Alessio (modern Lezhë) etc. Catholics were also present on his court (servants from Cattaro and Ragusa, mercenaries, guests etc.). In the central parts, Saxons were present in areas active in mining and trading. Serbia under Dušan claimed its identity through Orthodoxy and opposition to Catholicism. Catholics were persecuted, especially Catholic Albanians.

==Reign==
===Royal ideology===

Some historians consider that the goal of Emperor Dušan was to establish a new, Serbian-Greek Empire, replacing the Byzantine Empire. Ćirković considered his initial ideology as that of the previous Bulgarian emperors, who had envisioned co-rulership. However, starting in 1347, relations with John VI Kantakouzenos worsened, Dušan allied himself with rival John V Palaiologos.

Dušan was the first Serbian monarch who wrote most of his letters in Greek, also signing with the Imperial red ink. He was the first to publish prostagma, a kind of Byzantine document, characteristic for Byzantine rulers. In his royal title, &quot;Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks&quot;, his claim as Eastern Roman (Byzantine) successor is clear. He also gave Byzantine court titles to his nobility, something that would continue into the 16th century.

Dušan&#x27;s empire was multinational, with the three most important groups being Serbs, Greeks and Albanians. Different laws applied in the Serbian and Greek territories under Dušan&#x27;s control, but the Albanians were largely left to manage their lands under the leadership of their chiefs. His policies soon changed, and the laws against the Albanians became harsher with Albanian Catholics being forcibly converted into Orthodoxy and their churches were converted as well, while some of them migrated towards Greece, leaving empty villages behind, which were then taken by Slavic settlers. By allowing the Greeks to retain much of the landed property they held under the existing laws prior to Dušan&#x27;s conquest, Dušan was able to maintain order in the Greek territories and gain the loyalty of its inhabitants. In conquered Greek towns, local Greeks were given official administrative positions to better manage the settlement without upsetting the local populace, but a Serb governor would preside over the administration and command over a Serb garrison to ensure that the locals could not resist Dušan&#x27;s orders. As such, existing Byzantine laws continued to exist in the Greek territories, supplemented by specific edicts or charters issued by Dušan himself. Similarly, Dušan did not transform the Serbian and Albanian territories under his control by introducing a Byzantine administrative system.

===Lawmaker===

In Serbia itself, Dušan had initially retained the existing tax system and legal structure. Prior to Dušan&#x27;s reign, the Serbian state had functioned under its customary law. This customary law was supplemented by Saint Sava in the early 13th century, in which he added a Church canon law code that covered many matters of civil and family law. Aside from these standard laws, Serbian rulers could also issue edicts for a specific region or the nation as a whole, or grant charters and privileges to monasteries, noblemen, or merchant and miner communities. Dušan eventually decided to introduce a more general code, culminating in the introduction of Dušan Code in 1349.

For the purposes of Dušan Code, a wealth of charters were published, and some great foreign works of law were translated to Serbian; however, the third section of the Code was new and distinctively Serbian, albeit with Byzantine influence and attention to a long legal tradition in Serbia. Dušan explained the purpose of his Code in one of his charters; he intimated that its aims were spiritual and that the code would help his people to save themselves for the afterlife. The Code was proclaimed on 21 May 1349 in Skopje, and contained 155 clauses, while 66 further clauses were added at Serres in 1353 or 1354. The authors of the code are not known, but they were probably members of the court who specialised in law.

The Code proclaims on subjects both secular and ecclesiastic, the more so because Serbia had recently achieved full ecclesiastic autonomy as an independent Orthodox Church under a Patriarchate. The first 38 clauses relate to the church and they deal with issues that the Medieval Serbian Church faced, while the next 25 clauses relate to the nobility. Civil law is largely excluded, since it was covered in earlier documents, namely Saint Sava&#x27;s Nomokamon and in Corpus Juris Civilis. The Code originally dealt with criminal law, with heavy emphasis on the concept of lawfulness, which was mostly taken directly from Byzantine law.

The original manuscript of the Code has not survived. The Code remained a de facto constitution under the rule of Dušan&#x27;s son, Stefan Uroš V, and after the fall of the Serbian Empire in 1371, it was used in all the successor provinces. It was officially used in the successor state, Serbian Despotate, until its annexation by the Ottoman Empire in 1459. It was used as a reference for Serbian communities under Turkish rule, which exercised considerable legal autonomy in civil cases. It was also used in the Serbian autonomical areas under the Republic of Venice, like Grbalj and Paštrovići. It is the first recorded code of Serbian public law, and Dušan hoped that its introduction would bring uniformity in Serbian territories, which were the only portions of his empire where the code actually applied.

Dušan appointed Serbs to the highest military and civil positions within the empire for a number of reasons; not only did it allow him to maintain order by having loyal subjects hold positions of power, but it also appeased the Serb nobility, which demanded rewards such as land and positions of authority. This extended to the Church, in which Serbs were appointed to the highest episcopal positions, thereby replacing the Greeks.

===Military tactics===

Serbian tactics favored wedge shaped heavy cavalry attacks with horse archers on the flanks. Many foreign mercenaries were in the Serbian army in the 14th century, mostly German knights and Catalan halberdiers. Dušan had his personal mercenary guard on his disposal, consisting of German knights led by Palman, commander of the Serbian &quot;Alemannic Guard&quot;, who upon crossing Serbia to Jerusalem in 1331, became the leader of all mercenaries in the Serbian army. The main strength of the Serbian army were their heavy cavalry, feared for their ferocious charge and staying power. The imperial army of Stefan Dušan was built on existing military administration of Byzantium. Although the Vlach cavalry of Thessaly was disbanded, his army included Serbian feudal forces, Albanians and Greeks. Dušan recruited a light cavalry composed of 15,000 Albanians, armed with spears and swords.

The Serbian expansion in the former territory of the Byzantine Empire proceeded without a single major battle, as it was based on besieging Greek fortifications. The army Dušan used to conquer northern Greece consisted primarily of Albanians; German mercenaries were also used.

==Name, epithets and titles==
He was crowned &quot;Young King&quot; as heir apparent on 6 January 1322 but he was too young to really rule with his father 1322. and later in April 1326 Dušan appears as the co-ruler in Zeta and Zahumlje. He was entitled the rule of Zeta; thus he ruled as &quot;King of Zeta&quot;. In 1331 he succeeded his father as &quot;King of all Serbian and Maritime Lands&quot;. In 1343 his title was &quot;King of Serbia, Greeks, Albania and the coast&quot;. In 1345 he began calling himself &quot;tsar&quot;, Emperor, and in 1345 he proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor of Serbs and Eastern Romans&quot;. On 16 April 1346 he was crowned &quot;Emperor of Serbs and Greeks&quot;. This title was soon enlarged into &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of the Serbs and Greeks, the Bulgarians and Albanians&quot;.

His epithet &quot;Silni&quot; (Силни) is translated into &quot;the Mighty&quot;, but also &quot;the Great&quot;, &quot;the Powerful&quot; or &quot;the Strong&quot;.

==Legacy==
Stefan Dušan was the most powerful Serbian ruler in the Middle Ages and remains a folk hero to Serbs. Dušan, a contemporary of England&#x27;s Edward III, is regarded with the same reverence as the Bulgarians feel for Tsar Simeon I, the Poles for Sigismund I the Old, and the Czechs for Charles IV. According to Steven Runciman, he was &quot;perhaps the most powerful ruler in Europe&quot; during the 14th century. His state was a rival to the regional powers of Byzantium and Hungary, and it encompassed a large territory, which would also be his empire&#x27;s greatest weakness. By nature a soldier and a conqueror, Dušan also proved to be very able but nonetheless feared ruler. His empire however, slowly crumbled at the hands of his son, as regional aristocrats distanced from the central rule.

The aim of restoring Serbia as an Empire it once was, was one of the greatest ideals of Serbs, living both in the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian lands. In 1526, Jovan Nenad, in the style of Dušan, proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor&quot;, when ruling a short-lived state of Serbian provinces under the crown of Hungary.

&quot;The Realm of the Slavs&quot;, written by Ragusian historian Mavro Orbin (l. ca. 1550–1614), saw Emperor Dušan&#x27;s actions and works positively. The book served as the primary source about early history of South Slavs at the time and most of the western historians drew their information on the Slavs from it. Early Serbian historians, even though they wrote according to the sources, were influenced by the ideas of the time they lived in. They made efforts to harmonize with two different traditions: one from brevets and public documents and other from genealogies and narrative writings. Of early historians, most information came from Jovan Rajić (1726–1801), who wrote fifty pages about Dušan&#x27;s life. Rajić&#x27;s work had great influence on Serbian culture of that time, and for decades it was the main source of information about Serbian history.

After the restoration of Serbia in the 19th century, continuity with the Serbian Middle Ages was accentuated, particularly of its greatest moment – during Emperor Dušan. A political agenda, as with a restoration of his Empire, would find its place in the political programmes of the Principality of Serbia, notably the &quot;Načertanije&quot; by Ilija Garašanin.

==Family==
By his wife, Helena of Bulgaria, Emperor Dušan had at least a son, Stefan Uroš V, who succeeded his father as Emperor, r. 1355–1371. Dušan and Helena also had a daughter, Theodora, who in 1351, at twelve, married the Ottoman Sultan Orhan. Theodora most likely died between 1352 and 1354.

According to Nicephorus Gregoras, Dušan was negotiating a potential alliance with Orhan, which would have involved marrying off his daughter to Orhan himself or one of Orhan&#x27;s sons in 1351 with the aim of signing a truce between their kingdoms. However, after the Serbian emissaries were attacked by Nikephoros Orsini Serbia and the Ottoman Empire resumed hostilities.

Some historians speculate that the couple had another child, a daughter. J. Fine suggested that it might be &quot;Irina&quot; or &quot;Irene&quot;, the wife of &quot;caesar&quot; Preljub (governor of Thessaly, d. 1355–1356), mother of Thomas Preljubović (Ruler of Epirus, 1367–1384). In one theory, she married Radoslav Hlapen, Governor of Voden and Veria and Lord of Kastoria, after her first husband&#x27;s death in 1360. This hypothesis is not widely accepted.

<text>Median test (also Mood’s median-test, Westenberg-Mood median test or Brown-Mood median test) is a special case of Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test. It is a nonparametric test that tests the null hypothesis that the medians of the populations from which two or more samples are drawn are identical. The data in each sample are assigned to two groups, one consisting of data whose values are higher than the median value in the two groups combined, and the other consisting of data whose values are at the median or below. A Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test is then used to determine whether the observed frequencies in each sample differ from expected frequencies derived from a distribution combining the two groups.

==Relation to other tests==
The test has low power (efficiency) for moderate to large sample sizes. The Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney U two-sample test or its generalisation for more samples, the Kruskal–Wallis test, can often be considered instead. The relevant aspect of the median test is that it only considers the position of each observation relative to the overall median, whereas the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test takes the ranks of each observation into account. Thus the other mentioned tests are usually more powerful than the median test. Moreover, the median test can only be used for quantitative data.

However, the null hypothesis verified by the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney U (and so the Kruskal–Wallis test) is not about medians. The test is sensitive also to differences in scale parameters and symmetry. As a consequence, if the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney U test rejects the null hypothesis, one cannot say that the rejection was caused only by the shift in medians. It is easy to prove by simulations, where samples with equal medians, yet different scales and shapes, lead the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney U test to fail completely.

However, although the alternative Kruskal-Wallis test does not assume normal distributions, it does assume that the variance is approximately equal across samples. Hence, in situations where that assumption does not hold, the median test is an appropriate test. Moreover, Siegel &amp; Castellan (1988, p. 124) suggest that there is no alternative to the median test when one or more observations are &quot;off the scale.&quot;

<text>Erik Axel Karlfeldt (20 July 1864 – 8 April 1931) was a Swedish poet whose highly symbolist poetry masquerading as regionalism was popular and won him the 1931 Nobel Prize in Literature posthumously after he had been nominated by Nathan Söderblom, member of the Swedish Academy. Karlfeldt had been offered the award already in 1919 but refused to accept it, because of his position as permanent secretary to the Swedish Academy (1913–1931), which awards the prize.

==Biography==
Karlfeldt was born into a farmer&#x27;s family in Karlbo, in the province of Dalarna. Initially, his name was &quot;Erik Axel Eriksson&quot;, but he assumed his new name in 1889, wanting to distance himself from his father, who had suffered the disgrace of a criminal conviction. He studied at Uppsala University, simultaneously supporting himself by teaching school in several places, including Djursholms samskola in the Stockholm suburb of Djursholm and at a school for adults. After completing his studies, he held a position at the Royal Library of Sweden, in Stockholm, for five years.

In 1904, Karlfeldt was elected a member of the Swedish Academy and held chair number 11. In 1905, he was elected a member of the Nobel Institute of the academy, and, in 1907, of the Nobel Committee. In 1912, he was elected permanent secretary of the academy, a position he held until his death.

Uppsala University, Karlfeldt&#x27;s alma mater, awarded him the title of Doctor honoris causae in 1917.

Karlfeldt was a pantheist.

<text>A mountain man is an explorer who lives in the wilderness and makes his living from hunting and trapping. Mountain men were most common in the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the early 1840s). They were instrumental in opening up the various emigrant trails (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized wagon trains traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies, originally to serve the mule train-based inland fur trade.

Mountain men arose in a geographic and economic expansion that was driven by the lucrative earnings available in the North American fur trade, in the wake of the various 1806–1807 published accounts of the Lewis and Clark Expedition findings about the Rockies and the Oregon Country where they flourished economically for over three decades. By the time two new international treaties in early 1846 and early 1848 officially settled new western coastal territories in the United States and spurred a large upsurge in migration, the days of mountain men making a good living by fur trapping had largely ended. The fur industry was failing because of reduced demand and over trapping. With the rise of the silk trade and quick collapse of the North American beaver-based fur trade in the 1830s–1840s, many of the mountain men settled into jobs as Army scouts, wagon train guides or settled throughout the lands which they had helped open up. Others, like William Sublette, opened fort-trading posts along the Oregon Trail to serve the remnant fur trade and the settlers heading west.

==History==

Mountain men were most common in the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the 1830s). About 3,000 of them ranged the mountains between 1820 and 1840, the peak beaver-harvesting period. John Colter&#x27;s solo exploration of 1807-1808 made him one of the first Mountain men. While there were many free trappers, most mountain men were employed by major fur companies. The life of a company man was almost militarized. The men had mess groups, hunted and trapped in brigades, and always reported to the head of the trapping party. This man was called a &quot;boosway&quot;, a bastardization of the French term &quot;bourgeois&quot;. He was the leader of the brigade and the head trader.

Donald Mackenzie, representing the North West Company, held a rendezvous in the Boise River Valley in 1819. The rendezvous system was later implemented by William Henry Ashley of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, whose company representatives would haul supplies to specific mountain locations in the spring, engage in trading with trappers, and bring pelts back to communities on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, like St. Louis, in the fall. Ashley sold his business to the outfit of Smith, Jackson, and Sublette. He continued to earn revenue by selling that firm their supplies. This system of rendezvous with trappers continued when other firms, particularly the American Fur Company owned by John Jacob Astor, entered the field.

The annual rendezvous was often held at Horse Creek on the Green River, now called the Upper Green River Rendezvous Site, near present-day Pinedale, Wyoming. Another popular site in the same general area was Pierre&#x27;s Hole. By the mid-1830s, it attracted 450 to 500 men annually: essentially all the American trappers and traders working in the Rockies as well as numerous Native Americans. 

After achieving an American monopoly by 1830, Astor got out of the fur business before its decline. In the late 1830s, the Canadian-based Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) instituted several policies to undercut the American fur trade. During the same years, fashion in Europe shifted away from the formerly popular beaver hats; at the same time, the animal had become over-hunted. The HBC&#x27;s annual Snake River Expedition was transformed into a trading enterprise. Beginning in 1834, it visited the American rendezvous to buy furs at low prices. The HBC was able to offer manufactured trade goods at prices far below that with which American fur companies could compete. The last rendezvous was held in 1840, when the HBC, along with a decline in demand for and supply of beaver, had effectively put all American fur traders out of business. 

By 1841, the American Fur Company and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company were in ruins. By 1846, only some 50 American trappers still worked in the Snake River country, compared to 500 to 600 in 1826. Soon after the strategic victory by the HBC, the Snake River route was used by emigrants as the Oregon Trail, which brought a new form of competition. Former trappers earned money as guides or hunters for the emigrant parties.

A second fur trading and supply center grew up in Taos in what is today New Mexico. This trade attracted numerous French Americans from Louisiana and some French Canadian trappers, in addition to Anglo-Americans. Some New Mexican residents also pursued the beaver trade, as Mexican citizens initially had some legal advantages. Trappers and traders in the Southwest covered territory that was generally inaccessible to the large fur companies. It included parts of New Mexico, Nevada, California and central and southern Utah. After the decline in beaver and the fur trade, with some emigrants to the West using the Mormon Trail, former trappers found work as guides and hunters for the traveling parties.

After the short-lived Pacific Fur Company was liquidated, British-Canadian companies controlled the fur trade in the Pacific Northwest, first under the North West Company (NWC) and then the HBC. Both companies undertook numerous measures to prevent American fur traders from competing with them west of the Rocky Mountains, especially in the upper Snake River country. After the HBC took over operations in the Pacific Northwest in 1821, American fur traders in the Snake River country quickly went out business and moved on.

This halted American expansion into the region. After 1825, few American trappers worked west of the Rocky Mountains, and those who did generally found it unprofitable. According to historian Richard Mackie, this policy of the HBC forced American trappers to remain in the Rocky Mountains, which gave rise to the term &quot;mountain men&quot;.

Mountain men were instrumental in opening up the various emigrant trails (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized wagon trains traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies originally to serve the mule train based inland fur trade. By the time two new international treaties in early 1846 and early 1848 officially settled new western coastal territories on the United States and spurred a large upsurge in migration, the days of mountain men making a good living by fur trapping had largely ended. The fur industry was failing because of over-trapping. Fortuitously, America&#x27;s ongoing western migration by wagon trains with the goal of claiming cheap lands in the west was building rapidly from a trickle of settlers from 1841&#x27;s opening of the Oregon Trail to a flood of emigrants headed west by 1847–49 and thereafter well into the later 1880s.


By the time the fur trade began to collapse in the 1840s, motivating them to change jobs, the trails they had explored and turned into reliable mule trails and improved gradually into wagon-capable freight roads combined to allow them to work as guides and scouts. As the fur trade declined, mountain man Robert Newell told Jim Bridger: &quot;[W]e are done with this life in the mountainsdone with wading in beaver dams, and freezing or starving alternatelydone with Indian trading and Indian fighting. The fur trade is dead in the Rocky Mountains, and it is no place for us now if ever it was.&quot; At the same time the great push west along the newly opened Oregon Trail built up from a trickle of settlers in 1841 to a steady stream in 1844–46 and then became a flood as the highly organized Mormon migration exploited the road to the Great Salt Lake discovered by mountain man Jim Bridger in 1847–48. The migration would explode in 1849&#x27;s &quot;The Forty-Niners&quot; in response to the discovery of gold in California in 1848.

==Mode of living==
The life of a mountain man was rugged, and many did not last more than several years in the wilderness. They faced many hazards, especially when exploring unmapped areas: biting insects and other wildlife, bad weather, diseases of all kinds, injuries, and the opposition of Indigenous people who presented constant physical dangers. Grizzly bears were one of the mountain men&#x27;s greatest enemies. Winters could be brutal, with heavy snowstorms and low temperatures.

In order to stay alive, the men needed keen senses and knowledge of herbal remedies and first aid, among other skills. In summer, they could catch fish, build shelter, and hunt for food and skins. The mountain men dressed in suits made of deer skin that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time, which gave them some protection against the weapons of particular enemies. There were no doctors in the regions where mountain men worked, and they had to set their own broken bones, tend their wounds, and nurse themselves back to health.

===Fur trappers===
A fur trapper was a mountain man who, in today&#x27;s terms, would be called a free agent. He was independent and traded his pelts to whoever would pay him the best price. That contrasts with a &quot;company man&quot;, typically indebted to one fur company for the cost of his gear, who traded only with that company and was often under the direct command of company representatives. Some company men who paid off their debt could become free traders, using the gear they had earned. They might sell to the same company when the price was agreeable or convenient.

===Historical reenactment===
Historical reenactment of the dress and lifestyle of a mountain man, sometimes known as buckskinning, allows people to recreate aspects of this historical period. Today&#x27;s Rocky Mountain Rendezvous and other reenacted events are both history-oriented and social occasions. Some modern men choose a lifestyle similar to that of historical mountain men. They may live and roam in the mountains of the West or in the swamps of the southern United States.

==Notable mountain men==
* Jim Beckwourth (1798–1866) was born into slavery, arrived in Missouri with his parents and was freed by his father. He started working with the Ashley expedition, signed on with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, and became a well-known mountain man. He lived with the Crow for years and became a war chief. He was the only African American in the West to have his life story published (1856). He was credited with the discovery of Beckwourth Pass in the Sierra Nevada in 1850 and improved a Native American path creating what became known as the Beckwourth Trail through the mountains to Marysville, California.
* Jim Bridger (1804–1881) went west in 1822 at age 17 as a member of Ashley&#x27;s Hundred exploring the Upper Missouri River area. He was among the first non-natives to see the geysers and other natural wonders of the Yellowstone region. He is also considered one of the first men of European descent, along with Étienne Provost, to see the Great Salt Lake, which because of its salinity, he first believed was an arm of the Pacific Ocean. In 1830, Bridger purchased shares in the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. He established Fort Bridger in southwestern Wyoming and was well known as a teller of tall tales. Fort Bridger later figured in the history of the Donner Party.
* Francis Buzzacott (1861-1947), American hunter, trapper and explorer who wrote Buzzacott&#x27;s Masterpiece.
* Kit Carson (1809–1868) achieved notability for his later exploits, but he got his start and gained some early recognition as a trapper. Carson explored the west to California and north through the Rocky Mountains. He lived among and married into the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes. He was hired by John C. Frémont (&quot;the Pathfinder&quot;) as a guide and led him through much of California, Oregon, and the Great Basin area, and achieved national fame through Fremont. Stories of his life as a mountain man turned him into a frontier hero-figure, the prototypical mountain man of his time.
* Mansel Carter (1902–1987), a.k.a. &quot;Man of the Mountain&quot; was a businessman and gold prospector. In 1987, Phoenix Magazine named him one of &quot;Arizona Legends&quot;. His gravesite in the Gold Mountain of the San Tan Mountain Regional Park in Queen Creek, Arizona, is a tourist attraction.
* John Colter (1774–1812 or 1813), one of the first mountain men, was a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He later became the first European man to enter Yellowstone National Park and to see what is now Jackson Hole and the Teton Mountain Range. His description of the geothermal activity there seemed so outrageous to some that the area was mockingly referred to as Colter&#x27;s Hell. Colter&#x27;s narrow escape following capture by Blackfeet, leaving him naked and alone in the wilderness, became a legend known as &quot;Colter&#x27;s Run&quot;.
* George Drouillard (1774 or 1775–1810) was a hunter, interpreter, and sign-talker on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, often considered one of Lewis&#x27; two most appreciated members (with John Colter). Born to a French Canadian father and a Shawnee mother in Detroit, Drouillard proved to be the most skillful hunter on the expedition, notably during the harsh wintering in Fort Clatsop. He went on trapping in today&#x27;s Wyoming and Montana after the expedition, working for Manuel Lisa&#x27;s Missouri Fur Company, where he had signed on in 1807. Often venturing out alone like John Colter, notably to the headwaters of the Big Horn River from the Yellowstone and around the Three Forks of the Missouri, Drouillard was killed in May 1810 by Blackfoot Indians in the Three Forks area.
* Hugh Glass (1783–1833) was a frontiersman &amp; fur trapper best known for his survival from a grizzly bear attack near the Missouri River. The films &quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015) are fictionalized versions of Glass and the grizzly bear episode. 
* Sylvan &quot;Buckskin Bill&quot; Hart (1906–1980), known as the &quot;Last of the Mountain Men&quot;, lived along the Salmon River in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho from 1932 to 1980. 
* John &quot;Liver-Eating&quot; Johnson (1824–1900) was one of the more notable latter-day mountain men. Johnson worked in Wyoming and Montana, trapping for beaver, buffalo, and wolf hides. Unaffiliated with a company, Johnson bargained independently to sell his hides. Elements of his story were portrayed in the film &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;, and Dennis McLelland wrote a biography about him.
* Seth Kinman (1815–1888) was a legendary frontiersman best known for his settlement in California 
* Joseph Meek (1810–1875) was a trapper, law enforcement official, and politician in the Oregon Country and later Oregon Territory. A pioneer involved in the fur trade before settling in the Tualatin Valley, Meek played a prominent role at the Champoeg Meetings of 1843, where he was elected as a sheriff. Later he served in the Provisional Legislature of Oregon before being selected as the United States Marshal for the Oregon Territory.
* Jedediah Smith (1799–1831) was a hunter, trapper, and fur trader whose explorations were significant in opening the American West to settlement by Europeans and Americans. Smith is considered the first man of European descent to cross the future state of Nevada; the first to traverse Utah from north to south and from west to east; and the first American to enter California by an overland route. He was also first to scale the High Sierra and explore the area from San Diego to the banks of the Columbia River. He was a successful businessman and a full partner in the Rocky Mountain Fur Company after Ashley&#x27;s departure. Smith had notable facial scarring from a grizzly bear attack.
* William Sublette (1798–1845) was a fur trapper, pioneer, and mountain man who, with his brothers after 1823, became an agent of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company (and later one of its owners), exploiting the riches of the Oregon Country, which helped settle the best routes later improved into the Oregon Trail.
* Old Bill Williams (1787–1849) was a frontiersman &amp; furtrapper best known for his expeditions to the American west &amp; as an interpreter for the U.S. government

<text>Erotic massage is the use of massage techniques by one person on another person&#x27;s erogenous zones for their sexual pleasure. The process may achieve or enhance the recipient&#x27;s sexual excitation or arousal and sometimes achieve orgasm. The person providing the massage is called a masseur (male) or masseuse (female). Massages have been used for medical purposes for a very long time, and their use for erotic purposes also has a long history. In the case of women, the two focal areas are the abdomens and pubis, while in case of men, the focal areas are the male breast muscles and nipples, male genitals, the anus, and the prostate. When the massage is of a partner&#x27;s genitals (manual sex), the act is usually referred to as a handjob for penises and fingering for vulvas.

Today, erotic massage is used by some people on occasion as a part of sex, either as foreplay or as the final sex act, or as part of sex therapy. There is also a large commercial erotic massage industry in some countries and cities, which may call their establishments massage parlours, spas, or saunas.

==Commercial erotic and sexual massage==

An erotic and sexual massage may be provided by independent providers or providers of broader sexual services, through erotic massage agencies, or by organized massage parlors or brothels. It takes many forms, from massage techniques that aim to integrate the sexual, spiritual, and physical, to massage with the purpose of achieving orgasm through a handjob, oral sex, or sexual intercourse.

A &#x27;happy ending&#x27; is a colloquial term for the practice of a provider offering sexual release to a client. This is sometimes offered as an addition to any other type of massage, typically in the form of a handjob. The 2009 documentary &quot;Happy Endings?&quot; follows women who worked in Asian massage parlors in Rhode Island. The film focuses on &quot;full service&quot; massage parlors, although &quot;rub and tug&quot; massage parlors (where only handjobs are offered) are also covered. Prostitution in Rhode Island was legal at the time of filming.

==Legality==
In many jurisdictions, an erotic and sexual massage is regarded as a sexual service, the legality of which varies between jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, an erotic massage may be legal, while prostitution may not be.

==Sex therapy==
Erotic massage may be used in sex therapy as a means of stimulating the libido or increasing the ability of a person to respond positively to sensual stimulus. In some cases, erotic massage can be a form of foreplay without sexual gratification, intended to heighten the sensitivity of an individual prior to another engagement where sexual arousal and fulfillment is intended. In other cases, erotic massage may be used professionally to help men address issues of premature ejaculation.

==Use in medicine==
===Alleged practice by midwives===

According to Rachel P. Maines, in the Western medical tradition, genital massage of a woman to orgasm by a physician or midwife was a standard treatment for female hysteria, an ailment considered common and chronic in women. In 1653, Pieter van Foreest advised the technique of genital massage for a disease called &quot;womb disease&quot; to bring the woman into &quot;hysterical paroxysm&quot;. Such cases were quite profitable for physicians, since the patients were at no risk of death but needed constant treatment. However, the vaginal massage procedure (generally referred to as &quot;pelvic massage&quot;) was tedious and time-consuming for physicians. The technique was difficult for a physician to master and could take hours to achieve &quot;hysterical paroxysm&quot;. Referral to midwives, which had been common practice, meant a loss of business for the physician, and, at times, husbands were asked to assist.

However, Maines&#x27; depiction has been contested by other scholars, including Helen King, and Hallie Lieberman and Eric Schatzberg, claiming the idea is false. In reality, many practitioners of the pelvic massage were aware of the possibility of a sexual stimulation during the procedure and, like the Finnish physician Georg Asp (1834–1901), made it clear that the sexual excitation shall be circumvented and the clitoris studiously avoided.

===Development of the vibrator===

A solution was the invention of massage devices, which shortened the needed treatment from hours to minutes, removing the need for midwives and increasing a physician&#x27;s treatment capacity. Already at the turn of the century, hydrotherapy devices were available at Bath, and by the mid-19th century, they were popular at many high-profile bathing resorts across Europe and in America. By 1870, a clockwork-driven vibrator was available for physicians. In 1873, the first electromechanical vibrator was used at an asylum in France for the treatment of hysteria. While physicians of the period acknowledged that the disorder stemmed from sexual dissatisfaction, they seemed unaware of or unwilling to admit the sexual purposes of the devices used to treat it. In fact, the introduction of the speculum was far more controversial than that of the vibrator. By the turn of the 20th century, the spread of home electricity brought the vibrator to the consumer market. The appeal of cheaper treatment in the privacy of one&#x27;s own home understandably made the vibrator a popular early home appliance. In fact, the electric home vibrator was on the market before many other home appliance &quot;essentials&quot;: nine years before the electric vacuum cleaner and 10 years before the electric iron. A page from a Sears catalog of home electrical appliances from 1918 includes a portable vibrator with attachments, billed as &quot;very useful and satisfactory for home service&quot;.

<text>Sex work is &quot;the exchange of sexual services, performances, or products for material compensation. It includes activities of direct physical contact between buyers and sellers as well as indirect sexual stimulation&quot;. Sex work only refers to voluntary sexual transactions; thus, the term does not refer to human trafficking and other coerced or nonconsensual sexual transactions such as child prostitution. The transaction must take place between consenting adults of the legal age and mental capacity to consent and must take place without any methods of coercion, other than payment. The term emphasizes the labor and economic implications of this type of work. Furthermore, some prefer the use of the term because it grants more agency to the sellers of these services. 
==Types==
In 2004, a Medline search and review of 681 &quot;prostitution&quot; articles was conducted in order to create a global typology of types of sex work using arbitrary categories. Twenty-five types of sex work were identified in order to create a more systematic understanding of sex work as a whole. Prostitution varies by forms and social contexts, including different types of direct and indirect prostitution. This study was conducted in order to work towards improving the health and safety of sex workers.

Types of sex work include various consensual sexual services or erotic performances, involving varying degrees of physical contact with clients:
* Webcam modeling and pornographic modeling. The former is often done via a camming site, and the latter may or may not make use of an adult content-subscription service.
* Stripper
* Naked butler
* Pole dancing
* Phone sex operators: have sexually oriented conversations with clients, and may do verbal sexual roleplay
* Erotic dancing
* Erotic massage
* Pornographic film acting
* Peepshow performers
* Escort services / Girlfriend experience / Sugar baby
* Sexual surrogates: work with psychoanalysts to engage in sexual activity as part of therapy with their clients.
* Street prostitution
* Indoor prostitution (brothel work, massage parlor-related prostitution, bar or casino prostitution)
* Dominatrix

== Legal models ==
Full criminalization of sex work is the most widely practiced legal strategy for regulating transactional sex. Full criminalization is practiced in China, Russia, and the majority of countries in Africa. In the United States, in which each state has its own criminal code, full contact sex work is illegal everywhere, sex work using a condom is legal only in parts of Nevada; non-contact sex work is a gray and confused area. Under full criminalization the seller, buyer, and any third party involved is subject to criminal penalties. This includes anyone who profits from commercial sex in any location or physical setting. Criminalization has been linked to higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, partner violence, and police harassment. Fear of legal ramifications can deter sex workers from seeking proper sexual health care services and discourage them from reporting crimes of which they were the victim. According to research conducted by Human Rights Watch, criminalization has sex workers more vulnerable to rape, murder, and discrimination due to their marginalized position and ability to be prosecuted by the police even if they come forward as a victim.

Partial criminalization allows for the legalization of both the buying and selling of sex between two consenting parties but prohibits the commercial selling of sex within brothels or public settings such as street solicitation. This has the unintended consequence that it criminalizes the coalition of sex workers, forcing them to work alone and in less safe conditions. Partial criminalization ranges from a variety of legal models such as abolitionism, neo-abolitionism and the Swedish-Nordic Model.

Legalization is currently practiced in parts of South America, Australia, Europe, and in certain counties in the U.S. state of Nevada. The red light district in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is an example of full legalization, where all aspects of sex work are allowed as long as they are registered with the government. Since the registration process is often expensive and time-consuming, requires legal residence, and may involve regular medical exams, the most marginalized sex workers have to remain illegal, and usually charge less, because they cannot comply with the regulations. This is most common among minority groups, immigrants, and low-income workers.

Decriminalization is the most supported solution by sex workers themselves. The decriminalization of sex work is the only legal solution that offers no criminalization of any party involved in the sex work industry and additionally has no restrictions on who can legally participate in sex work. The decriminalization of sex work would not remove any legal penalties condemning human trafficking. There is no reliable evidence to suggest that decriminalization of sex work would encourage human trafficking. New Zealand was the first country to decriminalize sex work in 2003, with the passage of the &quot;Prostitution Reform Act&quot;. This is the most advocated for by sex workers because it allows them the most negotiating power with their clients. With full protection under the law, they have the ability to determine their wages, method of protection, and protect themselves from violent offenders. Sex work is one of the oldest professions in existence and even though sex work is criminalized in most places in order to regulate it, the profession has hardly changed at all over time. Those who work in sex trade are more likely to be exploited, trafficked, and victims of assault when sex work is criminalized. Starting in August 2015, Amnesty International, a global movement free of political, religious, or economic interests to protect people from abuse, introduced a policy that requested that all countries decriminalized sex work. Amnesty International stated in this policy that decriminalizing sex work would decrease human trafficking through promotion of the health and safety of sex workers by allowing them to be autonomous with protection of the government. This policy gained a large amount of support worldwide from the WHO, UNAIDS, GAATW, and several others, but has not been adopted universally yet.

==History==
Sex work, in many different forms, has been practiced since ancient times. It is reported that even in the most primitive societies, there was transactional sex. Prostitution was widespread in ancient Egypt and Greece, where it was practiced at various socioeconomic levels. Hetaera in Greece and geisha in Japan were seen as prestigious members of society for their high level of training in companionship. Attitudes towards prostitution have shifted through history.
During the Middle Ages prostitution was tolerated but not celebrated. It was not until the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century that attitudes turned against prostitution on a large scale and bodies began to be regulated more heavily. These moral reforms were to a large extent directed towards the restriction of women&#x27;s autonomy. Furthermore, enforcement of regulations regarding prostitution disproportionately impacted the poor.

Sex work has a long history in the United States, yet laws regulating the sale of sex are relatively new. In the 18th century, prostitution was deeply rooted from Louisiana to San Francisco. Despite its prevalence, attitudes towards prostitutes were negative and many times hostile. Although the law did not directly address prostitution at this time, law enforcement often targeted prostitutes. Laws against lewdness and sodomy were used in an attempt to regulate sex work. Red-light districts formed in the 19th century in major cities across the country in an attempt by sex workers to find spaces where they could work, isolated from outside society and corresponding stigma.

Ambiguity in the law allowed for prostitutes to challenge imprisonment in the courts. Through these cases prostitutes forced a popular recognition of their profession and defended their rights and property. Despite sex workers&#x27; efforts, social reformers looking to abolish prostitution outright began to gain traction in the early 20th century. New laws focused on the third-party businesses where prostitution took place, such as saloons and brothels, holding the owners culpable for the activities that happened within their premises. Red-light districts began to close. Finally, in 1910 the Mann Act, or &quot;White Slave Traffic Act&quot; made illegal the act of coercing a person into prostitution or other immoral activity, the first federal law addressing prostitution. This act was created to address the trafficking of young, European girls who were thought to have been kidnapped and transported to the United States to work in brothels but criminalized those participating in consensual sex work. Subsequently, at the start of the First World War, a Navy decree forced the closure of sex-related businesses in close proximity to military bases. Restrictions and outright violence led to the loss of the little control workers had over their work. In addition to this, in 1918, the Chamberlain–Kahn Act made it so that any woman found to have a sexually transmitted infection (STI) would be quarantined by the government. The original purpose of this act was to stop the spread of venereal diseases among U.S. soldiers. By 1915 under this act, prostitutes, or those perceived to be prostitutes could be stopped, inspected, and detained or sent to a rehabilitation facility if they were found to test positive for any venereal disease. During World War I, an estimated 3,000 women were detained and examined. The state had made sex workers into legal outcasts. During the Great Depression, black women in New York City accounted for more than 50% of arrests for prostitution.

Types of sex work expanded in the 21st century. Film and later the Internet provided new opportunities for sex work. In 1978, Carol Leigh, a sex worker and activist, coined the term &quot;sex work&quot; as it is now used. She looked to combat the anti-pornography movement by coining a term that reflected the labor and economic implications of the work. The term came into popular use in the 1980s. COYOTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics) and other similar groups formed in the 1970s and 80s to push for women&#x27;s sexual freedom and sex workers&#x27; rights. A rift formed within feminism that continues today, with some arguing for the abolishment of sex work and others working for acceptance and rights for sex works.

Stigmas are negative and often derogatory ideas and labels that are placed on one or more members of a community. A prevalent stigma of sex workers that is circulated through various media platforms is the &quot;whore&quot; stigma in which sex workers are labelled as &quot;whores&quot; due to the nature and abundance of client relationships.

A history of media narratives of sex workers was studied to yield the top three most common storylines shown in media about sex works. First, sex workers are shown as carriers and sources of disease. Second, sex work is shown as a social problem that varies in severity. And third, sex work is almost always portrayed in media to occur outdoors, which adds to negative social perceptions that associate sex work to be dirty or public. Across all of these narratives, we typically see a gendered hierarchy in which women of various ages are shown as the sex workers and men are portrayed as the authoritative role of pimps, clients, and law enforcers.

A study in 2006 from the University of Victoria found that when compared to media representations of sex work, firsthand experiences of sex workers were far from similar. It was found that even though inaccurate, media portrayals of sex work are formed from rigid social and cultural scripts that perpetuate stigma and provide influence to news coverage and negative perceptions of sex work.

The HIV/AIDS epidemic presented a new challenge to sex workers. The criminalization of exposing others to HIV/AIDS significantly impacted sex workers. Gay-related immune disorder, or GRID (later changed to AIDS), made headlines in 1985 and led to intermittent sex work. Sex workers were wrongfully held responsible for the transmission of the infection due to the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, which resulted in discrimination against them. Harm reduction strategies were organized providing testing, counseling, and supplies to stop the spread of the disease. This experience organizing helped facilitate future action for social justice. The threat of violence persists in many types of sex work. Unionization of legal types of sex work such as exotic dancers, lobbying of public health officials and labor officials, and human rights agencies has improved conditions for many sex workers. Nonetheless, the political ramifications of supporting a stigmatized population make organizing around sex work difficult. Despite these difficulties, actions against violence and for increased visibility and rights persist drawing hundreds of thousands of participants. Women in the sex trade are more susceptible to experiencing more stigma and discrimination than men. This stigma and discrimination is attributed to the negative social connotation of the job title &quot;sex worker&quot; and social perspective that sex workers have closer exposure to sexually transmitted infections like HIV and AIDS. These stigmas influence how society interacts with sex workers. In 2011, many sex workers in Hong Kong reported having a verbally or physically abusive interaction with a police officer or healthcare official, which prompted a negative impact on overall health and unequal access to healthcare.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, contact professions (which includes many forms of sex work, amongst others) had been banned (temporarily) in some countries. This has resulted in a reduction in Europe of certain forms of sex work. In addition, there has been a greater adoption of forms of sex work which do not require physical contact (virtual sexual services). Examples of sex work that do not require physical contact include webcam modelling and adult content-subscription services (e.g. OnlyFans).
Some sex workers have carried on regardless however, also because some virtual sexual services may require an official bank account (or other means of receiving money digitally) and an own private room. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened pre-existing marginalization, inequality, and criminalization of sex workers. With increased global health risks associated with the pandemic, sex workers&#x27; in-person services were suspended, posing more financial stressors to an already poverty-stricken population. COVID-19 regulations have specifically posed more threats to the physical and financial safety of socially disadvantaged sex workers who are undocumented, transgender, and of color.

== Sex work empowerment ==

=== International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers ===
Dr. Annie Sprinkle and the Sex Workers Outreach Project USA first observed the International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers on December 17, 2003, and has been continuously recognized for the last 17 years. Sprinkle and the Sex Workers Outreach Project USA first observed this day in memory of victims of the Green River Killer in Seattle Washington and has since evolved into an annual, international recognition for other cities who have lost many lives of sex workers, those who experience and have experienced violence, and to empower sex workers. During the week of December 17, the International Day to End Violence Against Sex workers calls attention to hate crimes around the world and social justice organizations work side-by-side with sex worker communities to hold memorials and stage actions to raise awareness of violence by focusing on condemnation of transphobia, xenophobia, racism, criminalization of drug use as well as stigma of sex work in order for sex work to be a safe, non criminalized practice.

=== Adult content-subscription services ===
In adult content-subscription services (e.g. OnlyFans) social media creators can be paid for their content. This content can include selfies, tips, information, tutorials, as well as sex work. OnlyFans creators make a lucrative profit from subscribers who purchase access to their exclusive account every month. OnlyFans has changed sex work in a way that has made it more powerful for the creator, and safer for them to control how they perform their sex work. Many OnlyFans creators that focus on sex work have reported that they receive more subscribers as they post more frequently. It is irrelevant if the posts are &quot;explicit&quot; or not. Several of the women who perform sex work on OnlyFans have regulars that they know everything about from their job description to family member names, to when their surgical procedures are. Although these creators are often paid for and may assist in their subscribers&#x27; orgasms, this act is not considered prostitution. Subscribers to OnlyFans sex work accounts have stated that they can get pornography for free anywhere, and that they are paying for a service catered to their personal needs. These subscribers are paying for people to be an online significant other who occasionally helps them achieve an orgasm.

==Emotional labor==
Emotional labor is an essential part of many service jobs, including many types of sex work. Through emotional labor sex workers engage in different levels of acting known as surface acting and deep acting. These levels reflect a sex worker&#x27;s engagement with the emotional labor. Surface acting occurs when the sex worker is aware of the dissonance between their authentic experience of emotion and their managed emotional display. In contrast deep acting occurs when the sex worker can no longer differentiate between what is authentic and what is acting; acting becomes authentic.
Sex workers engage in emotional labor for many different reasons. First, sex workers often engage in emotional labor to construct performances of gender and sexuality. These performances frequently reflect the desires of a clientele which is mostly composed of heterosexual men. In the majority of cases, clients value women who they perceive as normatively feminine. For women sex workers, achieving this perception necessitates a performance of gender and sexuality that involves deference to clients and affirmation of their masculinity, as well as physical embodiment of traditional femininity. The emotional labor involved in sex work may be of a greater significance when race differences are involved. For instance Mistress Velvet, a black, femme dominatrix, advertises herself using her most fetishized attributes. She makes her clients, who are mostly white heterosexual men, read Black feminist theory before their sessions. This allows the clients to see why their participation, as white heterosexual men, contributes to the fetishization of black women.

Both within sex work and in other types of work, emotional labor is gendered in that women are expected to use it to construct performances of normative femininity, whereas men are expected to use it to construct performances of normative masculinity. In both cases, these expectations are often met because this labor is necessary to maximizing monetary gain and potentially to job retention. Indeed, emotional labor is often used as a means to maximize income. It fosters a better experience for the client and protects the worker thus enabling the worker to make the most profit.

In addition, sex workers often engage in emotional labor as a self-protection strategy, distancing themselves from the sometimes emotionally volatile work. Finally, clients often value perceived authenticity in their transactions with sex workers; thus, sex workers may attempt to foster a sense of authentic intimacy.

== Health care for sex workers ==

=== Mental health care ===
Traumatic sexual events and violence put sex workers at a higher risk for mental health disorders. Women in sex work have a higher chance of suffering mental health disorders, and the chance is even greater for those who are women in minority groups including the LGBTQ+ community. A study performed in 2010 concluded that women in sex work were more likely to exhibit signs of PTSD (13%), anxiety (33.7%), and depression (24.4%). Women in sex work experience more obstacles and barriers to gaining mental health care despite their increased risk due to stigma, lack of access to insurance, lack of trust from health care professionals and misogyny. A study examining the institutionalized barriers to healthcare faced by female sex workers was conducted in Canada in 2016. The study yielded the finding that about 70% of female sex workers experience one or more institutional barriers to healthcare. These institutional barriers included long wait times, limited hours of operation, and biased treatment or discrimination on behalf of health care providers.

=== Primary health care ===
Sex workers are less likely to seek health care or be eligible to seek health care due to negative stigma. Women in sex work are disproportionally treated worse in health care settings. It is a minimal necessity that women in sex work have access to frequent STI testing and treatment, but it is essential that sex workers have the equal access for regular primary care for other ailments as non-sexworkers. UNAIDS researched the percentage rates of accessible prevention services for sex workers in 2010 around the world and concluded that 51% did not have access. Another obstacle for sex workers to gain health care services is that many are unable to, or unwilling to disclose their profession on required medical paperwork making them ineligible to receive medical care.

The population of sex workers has been targeted by the public health industry as a population that has a high risk of HIV infection. This concept is used to strategize marketing materials to sex workers about health resources, but it has been found to actually add to stigma and discrimination of sex workers, further delegitimize prostitution as a source of income, hinder effective health interventions, and perpetuate the idea that being a sex worker is a risk factor for disease. Public health care initiatives that prioritize HIV prevention among sex workers and portray sex workers as a vulnerable population overshadow the rights of sex workers and the legitimacy of sex work as a functional occupation. The title &quot;sex worker&quot; itself was introduced in an attempt to break the association by healthcare industries that links female prostitutes with dirty, immoral, and diseased identities.

====Factors in sex workers&#x27; health====
There is a possibility that sex work&#x27;s status as a criminal offense could lead sex workers to engage in practices that impact their own health and safety. In countries where sex work is classified as a crime, condoms can be used as a form of evidence. The Sex Workers Project is an organization that provides legal and social services for sex workers. In a study done regarding the impact of using condoms as evidence, the Brooklyn Defense Services provided data that showed that between 2008 and 2009 there were around 39 sex work-related cases in which condoms were used as evidence. There is a chance that in order to decrease the chance of arrest, sex workers are inclined to participate in unprotected sex. If this is the case, this would contribute to the higher risk of sexually transmitted infections these workers face, as aforementioned.

In Tangent with this, it is not uncommon for sex workers experiencing health difficulties to not take the appropriate steps with healthcare professionals due to fear or distrust in them. A survey done by STAR-STAR, a partner of the human rights organization UNFPA, concluded that almost a quarter of sex workers were denied healthcare services because of their occupation.

====Communication between health-care providers and sex workers====
In the interest of providing the best care for Sex Workers seeking health care, transparent communication can enhance the quality of services being provided. This can be practiced on both sides of this relationship. For example, a care provider could include questions in their sexual history questionnaire that pertain to the exchange of sex for money. Being prompted with these kinds of questions could mitigate the anxiety that if the patient is honest about what they do would cause their services to be declined. This might encourage the patient to be more honest about their entire experience and history, which would allow for a better decision to be made in regards to treatment.

== Intimate relationships ==
A study in Melbourne, Australia, found that sex workers typically experience relationship difficulties as a result of their line of work. This primarily stems from the issue of disclosure of their work in personal relationships. Some sex workers noted that dating ex-clients is helpful as they have had contact with sex workers, and they are aware of their employment.

Although a majority of women in sex work reported that their profession negatively affected them, those that stated a positive effect reported that they had increases sexual self-esteem and confidence. There is very little empirical evidence characterizing clients of sex workers, but they may share an analogous problem. A &quot;Scientific American&quot; article on sex buyers summarizes a limited field of research which indicates that Johns have a normal psychological profile matching the makeup of the wider male population but view themselves as mentally unwell.

Dolf Zillmann asserts that extensive viewing of pornographic material produces many sociological effects which he characterizes as unfavorable, including a decreased respect for long-term, monogamous relationships, and an attenuated desire for procreation. He claims that pornography can &quot;potentially undermine the traditional values that favor marriage, family, and children&quot; and that it depicts sexuality in a way which is not connected to &quot;emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities&quot;.

=== Commodified intimacy ===
In clients&#x27; encounters with prostitutes or exotic dancers (and potentially other sex workers as well), many seek more than sexual satisfaction. They often seek, via their interactions with sex workers, an affirmation of their masculinity, which they may feel is lacking in other aspects of their lives. This affirmation comes in the form of (a simulation of) affection and sexual desire, and &quot;smooth, intimate, affective space, wherein the way that time is managed is governed only by mutual desire and enjoyment.&quot; Partly because they are engaged in work during these interactions, prostitutes&#x27; experience and interpretation of time tends to be structured instead by desires to maximize income, avoid boredom, and/or avoid detriment to self-esteem.

For sex workers, commodified intimacy provides different benefits. In Brazil, sex workers prioritize foreign men over local men in terms of forming intimate relationships with sex workers. This is a result of local men regarding sex workers as having no worth beyond their occupation. In contrast, foreign men are often accompanied by wealth and status, which are factors that can help a sex worker become independent. Hence sex workers in Brazil are more likely to seek out &quot;ambiguous entanglements&quot; with the foreign men they provide services for, rather than the local men.

==Gender differences==
Interviews with men and women escorts illuminate gender differences in these escorts&#x27; experiences. On average, women escorts charged much more than men. Compared to traditional women escorts, women in niche markets charged lower rates. However, this disparity in rates did not exist for men escorts. Men escorts reported widespread acceptance in the gay community; they were much more likely than women to disclose their occupation. This community acceptance is fairly unusual to the gay community and not the experience of many women sex workers. Also, heterosexual men prostitutes are much more likely than heterosexual women prostitutes to entertain same-gender clients out of necessity, because the vast majority of clients are men. In general, there is a greater social expectation for women to engage in emotional labor than there is for men; there are also greater consequences if they do not.

==Risks==
The potential risks sex work poses to the worker vary greatly depending on the specific job they occupy. Compared to outdoor or street-based sex workers, indoor workers are less likely to face violence. Street sex workers may also more likely to use addictive drugs, to have unprotected sex, and to be the victim of sexual assault. HIV affects large numbers of sex workers, of all genders, who engage in prostitution globally. Rape and violence, poverty, stigma, and social exclusion are all common risks faced by sex workers in many different occupations. A study of violence against women engaged in street prostitution found that 68% reported having been raped. Sex workers are also at a high risk of murder. According to Salfati&#x27;s study, sex workers are 60 to 120 times more likely to be murdered than nonprostitute females. Although these features tend to apply more to sex workers who engage in full service sex work, stigma and safety risks are pervasive for all types of sex work, albeit to different extents. Because of the varied legal status of some forms of sex work, sex workers in some countries also face the risk of incarceration, flogging and even the death penalty.

==Feminist debate==

Feminist debates on sex work focus primarily on pornography and prostitution. Feminist arguments against these occupations tend to be founded in the notion that these types of work are inherently degrading to women, perpetuate the sexual objectification of women, and/or perpetuate male supremacy. In response, proponents of sex work argue that these claims deny women sex workers&#x27; agency, and that choosing to engage in this work can be empowering. They contend that the perspectives of anti-sex work feminists are based on notions of sexuality constructed by the patriarchy to regulate women&#x27;s expressions sexuality. In fact, many feminists who support the sex industry claim that criminalizing sex work causes more harm to women and their sexual autonomy. An article in the Touro Law Review 2014, focuses on the challenges faced by prostitutes in the U.S and the need for prostitution reform: &quot;[By criminalizing prostitution] women lose the choice to get paid for having consensual sex. A woman may have sex for free, but once she receives something of value for her services, the act becomes illegal&quot;. Those who see this as an attack on a women&#x27;s sexual autonomy also worry about the recent attacks on liberal social policy, such as same sex marriage and abortion on demand, in the U.S. Some liberals also argue that since a disproportionate share of those who choose sex work as a means of income are the poor and disadvantaged, public officials should focus on social policies improving the lives of those choosing to do so rather than condemnation of the &quot;private&quot; means which those victims of society employ. In an interview, Monica Jones, a Black transgender woman and activist, describes the need to address the conflation of sex work and human trafficking. 

=== Debates on sex worker agency ===
The topic of sexual labor is often contextualized within opposing abolitionist and sex-positive perspectives. The abolitionist perspective typically defines sex work as an oppressive form of labor. According to opponents of prostitution, it is not only the literal purchase of a person&#x27;s body for sexual exploitation, it also constitutes exertion of power over women both symbolically and materially. This perspective views prostitution and trafficking as directly and intimately connected and therefore calls for the abolition of prostitution in efforts to eliminate the overall sexual exploitation of women and children. Opponents also refute the idea of consent among sex workers by claiming that such consent is merely a submissive acceptance of the traditional exploitation of women. For these reasons, opponents believe that decriminalizing sex work would utterly harm women as a class by maintaining their sexual and economic exploitation while &quot;serving the interests of pimps, procurers and prostitutors&quot;. Some Marxist feminists argue sex work is not uniquely exploitative. Heather Berg writes, &quot;Commercial sex exchange is not exploitative because of anything unique to sex; it is exploitative because it is labor under capitalism.&quot;

Some sex-positive feminists recognize sex workers as situated within a modern Western sexual hierarchy where a married man and woman are respected while LGBT people, fetishists, and sex workers such as prostitutes and pornographic models are viewed as sexual deviants. According to sex positive feminists, sex law incorporates a prohibition against mixing sex and money in order to sustain this hierarchy. Therefore, the individuals who practice these &quot;deviant&quot; sexual acts are deemed as criminals and have limited institutional support and are subjected to economic sanctions. Sex-positive perspectives challenge this hierarchy by appreciating sexual diversity and rejecting any notion of &quot;normal&quot; sex. With this understanding, people who choose to engage in criminalized sex acts are seen as autonomous sexual beings rather than victims of the sex industry. For black women, agency is viewed as contextual due to historical considerations, and can be regarded as one facet of a complex system of ideals that encompass black women&#x27;s sexuality over time. One result of this is the way that race relations impact the mobility of black people in the sex industry.

Some liberal feminists believe that a &quot;democratic morality&quot; should judge sexual activity (as if the proclivities of the majority, as well as their proficiency in providing sexual pleasures, should determine the direction of a society&#x27;s moral compass) &quot;by the way partners treat one another, the presence or absence of coercion, and the quantity and quality of the pleasures they provide&quot;. They propound that it should not be an ethical concern whether sex acts are coupled or in groups, same or mixed sex, with or without consensual acts of violence or video, commercial or free.

<text>Mallrats is a 1995 American buddy comedy film written and directed by Kevin Smith and starring Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Claire Forlani, Priscilla Barnes and Michael Rooker. It is the second film in the View Askewniverse following 1994&#x27;s &quot;Clerks&quot;.

As in the other Askewniverse films, the characters Jay and Silent Bob feature prominently, and characters and events from other films are discussed. Several cast members, including Lee, Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams, have gone on to work in several other Smith films. Comic-book icon Stan Lee appeared, as did Brian O&#x27;Halloran, the star of Smith&#x27;s breakout feature &quot;Clerks&quot;.

Plans for a sequel film titled &quot;MallBrats&quot; were announced in March 2015. By the following year, the project was proposed to be a television miniseries, but by February 2017, Smith announced that he had not been able to sell the series to any network. In January 2020, Smith revealed that development on a sequel film had started again, this time under the title &quot;Twilight of the Mallrats&quot;.

&quot;Mallrats&quot; has had three versions released: the main version, an extended version, and a theatrical version. The theatrical release has a total of 100 differences between the extended and original version.

==Plot==
College student T.S. Quint is preparing for a trip to Universal Studios Florida in Orlando with Brandi Svenning, during which he plans to propose to her; however, Brandi tells him she cannot go due to having volunteered to fill in as a contestant on &quot;Truth or Date&quot;, her father&#x27;s dating game show, because the original contestant had died from an embolism bursting in her brain while swimming 700 laps at the local Y.M.C.A following T.S.&#x27;s comment regarding her weight. Brandi and T.S. argue over his responsibility and the two break up. T.S. turns to his best friend Brodie Bruce, who has been dumped by his girlfriend Rene, and Brodie suggests the two might find comfort at the local mall.

Brodie and T.S. discover &quot;Truth or Date&quot; is being filmed at the same mall, through their friend Willam, who throughout the film tries to see a sailboat in a Magic Eye poster. The two ask local slackers Jay and Silent Bob to destroy the show&#x27;s stage, a task for which they devise elaborate but ultimately unsuccessful plans. Brodie and T.S. run into Tricia Jones, a 15-year-old senior who is writing a book on the sex drive of men ages 14–30, for which she has sex with various men as research and films every encounter. She then reveals that the previous night she had sex with Shannon Hamilton, a 25-year-old clothing-store manager who hates Brodie because of his &quot;lack of a shopping agenda&quot;.

Brodie then learns that Rene has begun a relationship with Shannon. Brodie confronts Rene to find out more about the relationship, and the two have sex in an elevator. Brodie is later abducted and attacked by Shannon, who intends to have anal sex with Rene. As a result of this incident, Jay and Silent Bob assault the mall&#x27;s Easter Bunny, under the incorrect assumption that he attacked Brodie.

Brandi&#x27;s father Jared has Brodie and T.S. arrested on false charges of drug possession at the mall. Jay and Silent Bob are able to rescue Brodie and T.S., and they hide out at a local flea market. There, they encounter Ivannah, a topless fortune teller with three nipples, who offers advice on their relationship problems. While Brodie is visibly uncomfortable with the situation, T.S. pays close attention to Ivannah&#x27;s advice and decides to win Brandi back. Eventually, the two return to the mall.

Before the show begins, Brodie meets famed Marvel legend Stan Lee, who gives him advice on romance. After this, Brodie requests that his friend Tricia Jones retrieve footage of her having sex with Shannon. Meanwhile, T.S. also persuades Jay to get two of the game show contestants stoned, which allows him and Brodie to replace them on &quot;Truth or Date&quot;.

During the show, Brandi recognizes the voices of Brodie and T.S., leading to an on-air argument between them. Brodie eventually intervenes, explaining that T.S. has spent the entire day pining for Brandi. Subsequently, T.S. proposes to Brandi, who accepts. After the show concludes and as the police arrive to arrest T.S. and Brodie, Silent Bob broadcasts a sex tape featuring Shannon and Tricia. This leads to Shannon&#x27;s arrest for statutory rape. In the extended cut, Jared is arrested for 19 F.C.C. violations and broadcasting lewd or indecent images in a public forum. Consequently, Brodie and Rene rekindle their relationship.

The conclusion reveals that T.S. marries Brandi at Universal Studios while on a Jaws attraction, Tricia&#x27;s book is a bestseller, Shannon is imprisoned (and subsequently raped), Willam eventually does see the sailboat, Brodie becomes the host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (with Rene as his bandleader), and that Jay and Silent Bob get an orangutan named Susanne.

==Production==
After the success of the independent hit &quot;Clerks&quot;, writer/director Kevin Smith and his best friend/producer Scott Mosier began to make their second film. After a screening of &quot;Clerks&quot;, producer James Jacks approached them to do another film for Universal Studios. Smith soon finished the script for this new film, and casting began.

Jeremy London, an actor with a TV series and a few films to his credit, was cast as T.S.; Henry Thomas was the finalist of the role. Shannen Doherty was the most famous cast member after her appearances in several films and the hit TV show &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Jason Lee was cast with no prior acting experience; before the film, Lee was a professional skateboarder, and Adam Sandler and Steve Zahn were the finalists for the role of Brodie Bruce. Ben Affleck, who was a relative unknown at the time, was cast as Shannon Hamilton. Joey Lauren Adams was cast as Gwen Turner; she later dated Smith, and during that time, he wrote the main character in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; for her. Ethan Suplee was cast as Willam Black. Scott Mosier was supposed to reprise the role, but Smith and the film&#x27;s producers were so impressed with Suplee that they cast him, instead. The most troublesome role to cast was Jay, as Universal did not want Jason Mewes to have the role, despite the fact that he played it in &quot;Clerks&quot; and the character of Jay is based on him. Mewes had to audition for the part against actors such as Seth Green and Breckin Meyer. Smith also said that he wrote the role of Jared Svenning for William Atherton, but Atherton did not want to be typecast. 

Smith wanted to shoot the film in Seaview Square Mall in Ocean Township, New Jersey, but filmed it at Eden Prairie Center mall in Eden Prairie, Minnesota instead due to lower production costs.

==Reception==
The film grossed $400,000 on its Friday opening on 800 screens, $1.2 million on its opening weekend, and grossed an overall total of $2,122,561 at the box office.

&quot;Mallrats&quot; was the subject of much critical derision when it was released, with many critics comparing it unfavorably to Smith&#x27;s first film, &quot;Clerks&quot;. In his negative review of the film, critic Roger Ebert gave the film 1 1/2 stars out of 4 and said &quot;Before &quot;Mallrats&quot; was released, I chaired a panel that Smith participated in and Kevin Smith cheerfully said he&#x27;d be happy to do whatever the studios wanted, if they&#x27;d pay for his films. At the time, I thought he was joking.&quot; On their television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, Ebert&#x27;s colleague Gene Siskel said, &quot;I sat stonefaced throughout &quot;Mallrats&quot;, not laughing once. I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same talent involved that made &quot;Clerks&quot;.&quot; He deemed the jokes &quot;stale and recycled&quot; and recommended moviegoers rent &quot;Clerks&quot; instead of seeing &quot;Mallrats&quot;. 

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Mallrats&quot; colorfully expands the View Askewniverse, even if its snootchie has lost a few of the bootchies boasted by its beloved predecessor.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 41 based on 18 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

== Home media ==
In 1996 MCA/Universal Home Video released the movie on VHS and Laserdisc (the latter in widescreen format).

A DVD was released in 1999 including 1.85:1 Anamorphic widescreen picture &amp; 5.1 Dolby surround sound (both of which the movie was in for the Laserdisc release). Bonus features include:
* Audio commentary with director Kevin Smith, cast members Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, and Jason Mewes, and producers Scott Mosier &amp; Vincent Pereira
* Deleted scenes
* Featurette-&quot;View Askew&#x27;s Look Back At Mallrats&quot;
* Music Video-&quot;Build Me Up Buttercup&quot; by The Goops (Directed by Kevin Smith)
* Cast and Filmmaker Bios
* Theatrical trailer
The film was released on Blu-ray in 2014 and it used digital noise reduction and edge enhancement (as part of Universal&#x27;s 1990&#x27;s Best of the Decade collection); the menus were replaced with Universal-mandated menus, the Focus Features logo replaced the Universal logo at the start of the film, and some copies also included a code for a digital streaming version to be redeemed at Universal&#x27;s online UltraViolet service, and iTunes.

In 2005, a 10th anniversary double-sided DVD was released, containing the original version of the film, features from the previous DVD release, and an all new extended cut of the movie.

In 2020, Arrow Video released a 25th anniversary Blu-Ray that contains a third &quot;television cut&quot; of the film, with many scenes altered and re-dubbed to remove profanity.

===Extended cut===
The extended cut contains over 30 minutes of additional footage and subplots.
* An alternate opening scene, in which Mr. Svenning hosts a Ball for the Governor of New Jersey (played by Elizabeth Ashley). In this scene, T.S. (dressed as a colonial musketman), accidentally gets his musket tangled up in Brandi&#x27;s hair, then accidentally shoots at the Governor on the roof of a school, which ends up costing Mr. Svenning his reputation as well as a big pay raise. This explains the reason why Svenning shows an intense dislike for T.S. and why Brandi is so intent on breaking up with him. This scene also makes no mention of Julie Dwyer&#x27;s death, as the theatrical cut did. (That cut subplot was referenced in the final cut of the movie, where the TV execs mention to Svenning that they do not want a repeat of the Governor&#x27;s Ball.)
* Multiple lines throughout the movie are restored, related to T.S.&#x27;s &quot;attempted assassination&quot; of the governor. Many of these have wildly different reasons for having seen T.S. on the news, such as Shannon&#x27;s claim that he had tried to kidnap the President&#x27;s daughter.
* An extended sequence at Brodie&#x27;s house, where T.S. is hounded by the media as a result of his actions at the Governor&#x27;s Ball, including several TV movie offers.
* Included scenes where T.S. also makes it known to Brandi that he proposed to marry her.
* A scene in which Brodie and T.S. arrive outside of Mr. Svenning&#x27;s home, so T.S. can try and reconcile, and during the confusion, thanks to a news crew chasing T.S., then interviewing Brodie (who then implies that Mr. Svenning and Brandi take part in Satanic rituals), the news crew records footage of Svenning doing martial arts in a bath-towel. (Some of the footage of Mr. Svenning was re-edited in the theatrical release into the new intro.)
* A shot that shows the Quick Stop from &quot;Clerks&quot;.
* A new subplot of Brodie showing intentions of wanting to be on television, which explains his surprised look during his appearance on &quot;Truth or Date&quot;.
* The scene with Miss Ivannah has several restored lines.
* An extended arrest scene in which LaFours wants to put Brodie and T.S. into jail for an extended period of time, rather than &quot;overnight&quot; when the pair were initially arrested.
* An extended fight scene between Brodie and Shannon Hamilton, in which Hamilton tells Brodie to forget Rene.
* An extended rant from Mr. Svenning, a result of T.S. letting it slip that he intended to propose to Brandi.
* The scene where Mr. Svenning meets with Brodie before he has both Brodie and T.S. removed by LaFours has several restored lines and ends with more finger- and hand-licking of the melty pretzel chocolate by Mr. Svenning after the boys are removed.
* A scene after &quot;Truth or Date&quot; in which Mr. Svenning demands to have T.S. and Brodie arrested, but instead he is the one who is arrested. It turns out that since Svenning was the producer of the show, he faces multiple FCC fines for Brodie&#x27;s antics.
* An extended &quot;Where are they now?&quot; ending sequence, in which Mr. Svenning is shown at his job at the network as a janitor (along with his production assistant, still wearing his headset), and Shannon Hamilton is shown screaming after his rape in prison.
* A scene that showed Tricia flirting and having sex with LaFours in order to distract him from catching Jay and Silent Bob. This explains the final segment in the &#x27;where are they now&#x27; ending sequence, showing LaFours kissing Tricia during the book signing.

As explained by Kevin Smith in the introduction, most of the scenes were reworked because of the test audience&#x27;s negative reaction. Some of the dialogue had been re-dubbed in the theatrical release, but is restored in this version. (For example, the man who runs up to and is subsequently punched by T.S. outside the mall near the end originally asked if he had seen T.S. on CNN, whereas in the theatrical cut, he asks T.S. if he was the one who broke up with Brandi Svenning.) Other extended scenes have notable jump cuts.

The original DVD&#x27;s deleted scenes reel also featured the first draft opening sequence (in script form); here, T.S. is competing on a collegiate game show produced by Mr. Svenning; he accidentally mispronounces an answer (&quot;Bay of Bisquake&quot; instead of Bay of Biscay); his team loses, and in the confusion, T.S. accidentally damages a camera, and he must now pay Mr. Svenning for the damages. Brandi then breaks up with him, and a man on a bus mistakenly thinks that T.S. will kill him after seeing him in a news report. Several alternate openings, with different voiceover spiels from Brodie (including one which has him recounting the events up to him nearly getting assaulted by Hamilton on the &quot;Truth or Date&quot; stage) were also seen in that reel.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack album was released in October 1995. It features mainly alternative rock from the 90s along with dialogue from the film. The ordering of the songs on the soundtrack album is not the order they appear as in the film. For example, Squirtgun&#x27;s &quot;Social&quot; opens the film, while Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Susanne&quot; ends the film, with Wax&#x27;s &quot;Mallrats&quot; playing over the end credits. The song &quot;Boogie Shoes&quot; by KC and the Sunshine Band makes an appearance, when Brodie and T.S. drive to the flea market. However, it was excluded from the soundtrack album. A music video for The Goops&#x27; version of &quot;Build Me Up Buttercup&quot; was directed by Smith and featured both Smith and Mewes.

==Sequel==
On March 13, 2015, Smith confirmed that &quot;Mallrats 2&quot; was being written and was slated to begin shooting in summer 2016. In April 2015, Smith announced that &quot;Mallrats 2&quot; would be his next film, instead of &quot;Clerks III&quot; as originally intended, and would begin filming in 2015. From April 2015 to July 2016, Smith made a series of announcements regarding the proposed sequel, some regarding casting and some announcing delays in production. During this time, the planned film became a planned 10-episode television miniseries.

In February 2017, Smith announced that pitches to six different networks resulted in no one willing to produce the TV series, but expressed his hope that interest in the series would spike after the release of the film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot;.

In January 2020, Smith announced that development on a &quot;Mallrats&quot; sequel film had started up again, under a new title, &quot;Twilight of the Mallrats&quot;. On April 24, Smith stated that he had completed the first draft of the script and that the original cast would return. On May 12, 2020, Smith revealed that Aparna Brielle, who played Jihad in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot;, had been set to lead the film as Banner, the daughter of Brodie, and that Doherty would return to reprise her role of Rene Mosier. 

Doherty died on July 13, 2024. A few months later, however, Smith suggested that the sequel could still be made, reframed as a tribute to Doherty, with her friend Sarah Michelle Gellar—who had auditioned for a role in the original &quot;Mallrats&quot;—&quot;step[ping] in for&quot; her. In an Instagram comment, Gellar expressed support for the idea.

<doc id="236654" wikidata="Q14149" url="?curid=236654" title="Internet Group Management Protocol">
<text>The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is a communications protocol used by hosts and adjacent routers on IPv4 networks to establish multicast group memberships. IGMP is an integral part of IP multicast and allows the network to direct multicast transmissions only to hosts that have requested them.

IGMP can be used for one-to-many networking applications such as online streaming video and gaming, and allows more efficient use of resources when supporting these types of applications.

IGMP is used on IPv4 networks. Multicast management on IPv6 networks is handled by Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) which is a part of ICMPv6 in contrast to IGMP&#x27;s bare IP encapsulation.

==Architecture==
A network designed to deliver a multicast service using IGMP might use this basic architecture:

IGMP operates between a host and a local multicast router. Switches featuring IGMP snooping also derive useful information by observing these IGMP transactions. Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is then used between the local and remote multicast routers to direct multicast traffic from hosts sending multicasts to hosts that have registered through IGMP to receive them.

IGMP operates on the network layer (layer 3), just the same as other network management protocols like ICMP.

The IGMP protocol is implemented on hosts and within routers. A host requests membership to a group through its local router while a router listens for these requests and periodically sends out subscription queries. A single router per subnet is elected to perform this querying function. Some multilayer switches include an IGMP querier capability to allow their IGMP snooping features to work in the absence of an IGMP-capable router in the layer 2 network.

IGMP is vulnerable to some attacks, and firewalls commonly allow the user to disable it if not needed.

==Versions==
There are three versions of IGMP.
IGMPv1 was defined in 1989. IGMPv2, defined in 1997, improves IGMPv1 by adding the ability for a host to signal a desire to leave a multicast group.

In 2002, IGMPv3 improved IGMPv2 by supporting source-specific multicast and introduces membership report aggregation. The support for source-specific multicast was improved in 2006.

The three versions of IGMP are backward compatible. A router supporting IGMPv3 can support clients running IGMPv1, IGMPv2, and IGMPv3. IGMPv1 uses a query-response model. Queries are sent to . Membership reports are sent to the group&#x27;s multicast address. IGMPv2 accelerates the process of leaving a group and adjusts other timeouts. Leave-group messages are sent to . A group-specific query is introduced. Group-specific queries are sent to the group&#x27;s multicast address. A means for routers to select an IGMP querier for the network is introduced. IGMPv3 introduces source-specific multicast capability. Membership reports are sent to .

==Messages==
There are several types of IGMP messages: 
; General membership queries: Sent by multicast routers to determine which multicast addresses are of interest to systems attached to the network(s) they serve to refresh the group membership state for all systems on its network.
; Group-specific membership queries: Used for determining the reception state for a particular multicast address.
; Group-and-source-specific queries: Allow the router to determine if any systems desire reception of messages sent to a multicast group from a source address specified in a list of unicast addresses.
; Membership reports: Sent by multicast receivers in response to a membership query or asynchronously when first registering for a multicast group.
; Leave group messages: Sent by multicast receivers when specified multicast transmissions are no longer needed at the receiver.

IGMP messages are carried in bare IP packets with IP protocol number 2. Similar to the Internet Control Message Protocol, there is no transport layer used with IGMP messaging.

<doc id="236666" wikidata="Q62614" url="?curid=236666" title="Androgen">
<text>An androgen (from Greek &quot;andr-&quot;, the stem of the word meaning ) is any natural or synthetic steroid hormone that regulates the development and maintenance of male characteristics in vertebrates by binding to androgen receptors. This includes the embryological development of the primary male sex organs, and the development of male secondary sex characteristics at puberty. Androgens are synthesized in the testes, the ovaries, and the adrenal glands.

Androgens increase in both males and females during puberty. The major androgen in males is testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenedione are of equal importance in male development. DHT &quot;in utero&quot; causes differentiation of the penis, scrotum and prostate. In adulthood, DHT contributes to balding, prostate growth, and sebaceous gland activity.

Although androgens are commonly thought of only as male sex hormones, females also have them, but at lower levels: they function in libido and sexual arousal. Androgens are the precursors to estrogens in both men and women.

In addition to their role as natural hormones, androgens are used as medications; for information on androgens as medications, see the androgen replacement therapy and anabolic steroid articles.

==Types and examples==
The main subset of androgens, known as adrenal androgens, is composed of 19-carbon steroids synthesized in the zona reticularis, the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex. Adrenal androgens function as weak steroids (though some are precursors), and the subset includes dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione (A4), and androstenediol (A5).

Besides testosterone, other androgens include:
* Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal cortex from cholesterol. It is the primary precursor of both the androgen and estrogen sex hormones. DHEA is also called dehydroisoandrosterone or dehydroandrosterone.
* Androstenedione (A4) is an androgenic steroid produced by the testes, adrenal cortex, and ovaries. While androstenedione is converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgens, it is also the parent structure of estrone. Use of androstenedione as an athletic or bodybuilding supplement has been banned by the International Olympic Committee, as well as other sporting organizations.
* Androstenediol (A5) is a steroid metabolite of DHEA and the precursor to sex hormones testosterone and estradiol.
* Androsterone is a chemical byproduct created during the breakdown of androgens, or derived from progesterone, that also exerts minor masculinising effects, but with one-seventh the intensity of testosterone. It is found in approximately equal amounts in the plasma and urine of both males and females.
* Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a metabolite of testosterone, and a more potent androgen than testosterone in that it binds more strongly to androgen receptors. It is produced in the skin and reproductive tissue.
* A4 and testosterone can also have an extra hydroxyl (-OH) or keton (=O) group bound on position 11. In this case you can have 11-hydroxyandrostenedione, 11-ketoandrostenedione, 11-hydroxytestosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone. The latter has the same biological activity as testosterone and, therefore, these are also very important in healthy individuals and patients with diseases like, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, or premature adrenarche. 

Determined by consideration of all biological assay methods ():

=== Female ovarian and adrenal androgens ===

The ovaries and adrenal glands also produce androgens, but at much lower levels than the testes. Regarding the relative contributions of ovaries and adrenal glands to female androgen levels, in a study with six menstruating women the following observations have been made:
* Adrenal contribution to peripheral T, DHT, A, DHEA and DHEA-S is relatively constant throughout the menstrual cycle.
* Ovarian contribution of peripheral T, A and DHEA-S reaches maximum levels at mid-cycle, whereas ovarian contribution to peripheral DHT and DHEA does not seem to be influenced by the menstrual cycle.
* Ovary and adrenal cortex contribute equally to peripheral T, DHT and A, with the exception that at mid-cycle ovarian contribution of peripheral A is twice that of the adrenal.
* Peripheral DHEA and DHEA-S are produced mainly in the adrenal cortex which provides 80% of DHEA and over 90% of DHEA-S.

==Biological function==

===Male prenatal development===

====Testes formation====
During mammalian development, the gonads are at first capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. In humans, starting at about week 4, the gonadal rudiments are present within the intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the developing kidneys. At about week 6, epithelial sex cords develop within the forming testes and incorporate the germ cells as they migrate into the gonads. In males, certain Y chromosome genes, particularly SRY, control development of the male phenotype, including conversion of the early bipotential gonad into testes. In males, the sex cords fully invade the developing gonads.

====Androgen production====
The mesoderm-derived epithelial cells of the sex cords in developing testes become the Sertoli cells, which will function to support sperm cell formation. A minor population of nonepithelial cells appear between the tubules by week 8 of human fetal development. These are Leydig cells. Soon after they differentiate, Leydig cells begin to produce androgens.

====Androgen effects====
The androgens function as paracrine hormones required by the Sertoli cells to support sperm production. They are also required for the masculinization of the developing male fetus (including penis and scrotum formation). Under the influence of androgens, remnants of the mesonephron, the Wolffian ducts, develop into the epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicles. This action of androgens is supported by a hormone from Sertoli cells, Müllerian inhibitory hormone (MIH), which prevents the embryonic Müllerian ducts from developing into fallopian tubes and other female reproductive tract tissues in male embryos. MIH and androgens cooperate to allow for movement of testes into the scrotum.

====Early regulation====
Before the production of the pituitary hormone luteinizing hormone (LH) by the embryo starting at about weeks 11–12, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) promotes the differentiation of Leydig cells and their production of androgens at week 8. Androgen action in target tissues often involves conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

===Male pubertal development===
At the time of puberty, androgen levels increase dramatically in males, and androgens mediate the development of masculine secondary sexual characteristics as well as the activation of spermatogenesis and fertility and masculine behavioral changes such as increased sex drive. Masculine secondary sexual characteristics include androgenic hair, voice deepening, emergence of the Adam&#x27;s apple, broadening of the shoulders, increased muscle mass, and penile growth.

===Spermatogenesis===
During puberty, androgen, LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) production increase and the sex cords hollow out, forming the seminiferous tubules, and the germ cells start to differentiate into sperm. Throughout adulthood, androgens and FSH cooperatively act on Sertoli cells in the testes to support sperm production. Exogenous androgen supplements can be used as a male contraceptive. Elevated androgen levels caused by use of androgen supplements can inhibit production of LH and block production of endogenous androgens by Leydig cells. Without the locally high levels of androgens in testes due to androgen production by Leydig cells, the seminiferous tubules can degenerate, resulting in infertility. For this reason, many transdermal androgen patches are applied to the scrotum.

===Fat deposition===
Males typically have less body fat than females. Recent results indicate androgens inhibit the ability of some fat cells to store lipids by blocking a signal transduction pathway that normally supports adipocyte function. Also, androgens, but not estrogens, increase beta adrenergic receptors while decreasing alpha adrenergic receptors- which results in increased levels of epinephrine/ norepinephrine due to lack of alpha-2 receptor negative feedback and decreased fat accumulation due to epinephrine/ norepinephrine then acting on lipolysis-inducing beta receptors.

===Muscle mass===
Males typically have more skeletal muscle mass than females. Androgens promote the enlargement of skeletal muscle cells in a coordinated manner by acting on several cell types in skeletal muscle tissue. One cell type, called the myoblast, conveys androgen receptors for generating muscle. Fusion of myoblasts generates myotubes, in a process linked to androgen receptor levels. Higher androgen levels lead to increased expression of androgen receptor.

===Brain===
Circulating levels of androgens can influence human behavior because some neurons are sensitive to steroid hormones. Androgen levels have been implicated in the regulation of human aggression and libido. Indeed, androgens are capable of altering the structure of the brain in several species, including mice, rats, and primates, producing sex differences. Although more recent studies showing the general mood of transgender men, who have undergone transgender hormone replacement therapy replacing estrogens with androgens, do not show any substantial long-term behavioral changes.

Numerous reports have shown androgens alone are capable of altering the structure of the brain, but identification of which alterations in neuroanatomy stem from androgens or estrogens is difficult, because of their potential for conversion.

Evidence from neurogenesis (formation of new neurons) studies on male rats has shown that the hippocampus is a useful brain region to examine when determining the effects of androgens on behavior. To examine neurogenesis, wild-type male rats were compared with male rats that had androgen insensitivity syndrome, a genetic difference resulting in complete or partial insensitivity to androgens and a lack of external male genitalia.

Neural injections of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were applied to males of both groups to test for neurogenesis. Analysis showed that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone regulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, but not in the TMF male rats. To further test the role of activated androgen receptors on AHN, flutamide, an antiandrogen drug that competes with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for androgen receptors, and dihydrotestosterone were administered to normal male rats. Dihydrotestosterone increased the number of BrdU cells, while flutamide inhibited these cells.

Moreover, estrogens had no effect. This research demonstrates how androgens can increase AHN.

Researchers also examined how mild exercise affected androgen synthesis which in turn causes AHN activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.

NMDA induces a calcium flux that allows for synaptic plasticity which is crucial for AHN.

Researchers injected both orchidectomized (ORX) (castrated) and sham castrated male rats with BrdU to determine if the number of new cells was increased. They found that AHN in male rats is increased with mild exercise by boosting synthesis of dihydrotestosterone in the hippocampus.

Again it was noted that AHN was not increased via activation of the estrogen receptors.

Androgen regulation decreases the likelihood of depression in males. In preadolescent male rats, neonatal rats treated with flutamide developed more depression-like symptoms compared to control rats.

Again BrdU was injected into both groups of rats in order to see if cells were multiplying in the living tissue. These results demonstrate how the organization of androgens has a positive effect on preadolescent hippocampal neurogenesis that may be linked with lower depression-like symptoms.

Social isolation has a hindering effect in AHN whereas normal regulation of androgens increases AHN. A study using male rats showed that testosterone may block social isolation, which results in hippocampal neurogenesis reaching homeostasis—regulation that keeps internal conditions stable. A Brdu analysis showed that excess testosterone did not increase this blocking effect against social isolation; that is, the natural circulating levels of androgens cancel out the negative effects of social isolation on AHN.

===Female-specific effects===
Androgens have potential roles in relaxation of the myometrium via non-genomic, androgen receptor-independent pathways, preventing premature uterine contractions in pregnancy.

===Androgen insensitivity===

Reduced ability of an XY-karyotype fetus to respond to androgens can result in one of several conditions, including infertility and several forms of intersex conditions.

===Miscellaneous===
Yolk androgen levels in certain birds have been positively correlated to social dominance later in life. See American coot.

==Biological activity==
Androgens bind to and activate androgen receptors (ARs) to mediate most of their biological effects.

===Relative potency===
Determined by consideration of all biological assay methods ():

5α-Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was 2.4 times more potent than testosterone at maintaining normal prostate weight and duct lumen mass (this is a measure of epithelial cell function stimulation). Whereas DHT was equally potent as testosterone at preventing prostate cell death after castration.
One of the 11-oxygenated androgens, namely 11-ketotestosterone, has the same potency as testosterone. 

===Non-genomic actions===
Androgens have also been found to signal through membrane androgen receptors, which are distinct from the classical nuclear androgen receptor.

==Biochemistry==
===Biosynthesis===
Androgens are synthesized from cholesterol and are produced primarily in the gonads (testicles and ovaries) and also in the adrenal glands. The testicles produce a much higher quantity than the ovaries. Conversion of testosterone to the more potent DHT occurs in prostate gland, liver, brain and skin.

===Metabolism===
Androgens are metabolized mainly in the liver.

==Medical uses==
A low testosterone level (hypogonadism) in men may be treated with testosterone administration. Prostate cancer may be treated by removing the major source of testosterone: testicle removal (orchiectomy); or agents which block androgens from accessing their receptor: antiandrogens.

<text>Mona Font is both a Japanese proportional pixel font for the X Window System, derived from the Shinonome raster font family, and a TrueType font. It aims to represent Shift JIS art graphics properly, almost all of which require the MS PGothic font. Mona is named after Mona, a character-based mascot of 2channel.

Mona uses glyphs from Shinonome (東雲) version 0.9.9 (Gothic) for embedded bitmaps. In version 2.30-pre, it incorporated outlines from Kochi-Gothic. However, it was changed to Kochi-substitute in 2.30-pre2 after discovering that Kochi font violates copyright. After this, the glyphs in Mona resemble those in MS PGothic.

Mona supports the following code pages: 1252 (Latin 1), 1250 (Latin 2: East Europe), 1251 (Cyrillic), 1253 (Greek), 932 (JIS/Japan), 737 (Greek; former 437G), 437 (US).

==mona-outline==
mona-outline version 2.30pre2 is included with the source code for the Mona Font source package, which consists of a subset of glyphs found in Mona. The OpenType layout table supports standard ligatures in the default language. When the font is viewed under Windows Font Viewer, a horizontal stroke overlays the glyph.

mona-outline supports the following code pages: 932 (JIS/Japan), 437 (US).

==IPA monafont==
IPA monafont is an extension of , , , created by Jun Kobayashi, which consists of a family of fonts:

The IPA monafont family supports the following code pages: 1252 (Latin 1), 1251 (Cyrillic), 932 (JIS/Japan), 950 (Big-5), Macintosh Character Set (US Roman), Windows OEM Character Set, 866 (MS-DOS Russian), 865 (MS-DOS Nordic), 863 (MS-DOS Canadian French), 861 (MS-DOS Icelandic), 860 (MS-DOS Portuguese), 855 (IBM Cyrillic; primary Russian), 437 (US).

Glyphs for CJK ideographs are reworked to look more like Arial Unicode MS, while sub-glyphs for these characters are repositioned and rescaled. Similar to the MS Gothic and MS Mincho font families, its reverse solidus glyph uses a yen sign instead of a backslash. A similar non-standard substitution can be found in the Gulim and Dotum font families.

<text>Ayurveda (; ) is an alternative medicine system with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent. It is heavily practiced throughout India and Nepal, where as much as 80% of the population report using ayurveda. The theory and practice of ayurveda is pseudoscientific and toxic metals including lead and mercury are used as ingredients in many ayurvedic medicines. 

Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia. Therapies include herbal medicines, special diets, meditation, yoga, massage, laxatives, enemas, and medical oils. Ayurvedic preparations are typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals, and metal substances (perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or &quot;rasashastra&quot;). Ancient ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques, including rhinoplasty, lithotomy, sutures, cataract surgery, and the extraction of foreign objects.

Historical evidence for ayurvedic texts, terminology and concepts appears from the middle of the first millennium BCE onwards. The main classical ayurveda texts begin with accounts of the transmission of medical knowledge from the gods to sages, and then to human physicians. Printed editions of the &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; (&quot;Sushruta&#x27;s Compendium&quot;), frame the work as the teachings of Dhanvantari, the Hindu deity of ayurveda, incarnated as King Divodāsa of Varanasi, to a group of physicians, including Sushruta. The oldest manuscripts of the work, however, omit this frame, ascribing the work directly to King Divodāsa. 

In ayurveda texts, &quot;dosha&quot; balance is emphasized, and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy and claimed to lead to illness. Ayurveda treatises describe three elemental &quot;doshas&quot;: &quot;vāta&quot;, &quot;pitta&quot; and &quot;kapha&quot;, and state that balance (Skt. &quot;sāmyatva&quot;) of the &quot;doshas&quot; results in health, while imbalance (&quot;viṣamatva&quot;) results in disease. Ayurveda treatises divide medicine into eight canonical components. Ayurveda practitioners had developed various medicinal preparations and surgical procedures from at least the beginning of the common era.

Ayurveda has been adapted for Western consumption, notably by Baba Hari Dass in the 1970s and Maharishi ayurveda in the 1980s.

Although some Ayurvedic treatments can help relieve some symptoms of cancer, there is no good evidence that the disease can be treated or cured through ayurveda.

Several ayurvedic preparations have been found to contain lead, mercury, and arsenic, substances known to be harmful to humans. A 2008 study found the three substances in close to 21% of U.S. and Indian-manufactured patent ayurvedic medicines sold through the Internet. The public health implications of such metallic contaminants in India are unknown.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;āyurveda&quot; () is composed of two words, &quot;āyus&quot;, , &quot;life&quot; or &quot;longevity&quot;, and &quot;veda&quot;, , &quot;knowledge&quot;, translated as &quot;knowledge of longevity&quot; or &quot;knowledge of life and longevity&quot;.

== Eight components ==
The earliest classical Sanskrit works on ayurveda describe medicine as being divided into eight components (Skt. &quot;aṅga&quot;). This characterization of the physician&#x27;s art, &quot;the medicine that has eight components&quot; (), is first found in the Sanskrit epic the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, c. 4th century BCE. The components are:
* &quot;Kāyachikitsā&quot;: general medicine, medicine of the body
* &quot;Kaumāra-bhṛtya&quot; (Pediatrics): Discussions about prenatal and postnatal care of baby and mother; methods of conception; choosing the child&#x27;s sex, intelligence, and constitution; childhood diseases; and midwifery
* &quot;Śalyatantra&quot;: surgical techniques and the extraction of foreign objects
* &quot;Śhālākyatantra:&quot; treatment of ailments affecting openings or cavities in the upper body: ears, eyes, nose, mouth, etc.
* &quot;Bhūtavidyā&quot;: pacification of possessing spirits, and the people whose minds are affected by such possession
* &quot;Agadatantra&quot;/&quot;Vishagara-vairodh Tantra&quot; (Toxicology): includes epidemics; toxins in animals, vegetables and minerals; and keys for recognizing those anomalies and their antidotes
* &quot;Rasāyantantra&quot;: rejuvenation and tonics for increasing lifespan, intellect and strength
* &quot;Vājīkaraṇatantra&quot;: aphrodisiacs; treatments for increasing the volume and viability of semen and sexual pleasure; infertility problems; and spiritual development (transmutation of sexual energy into spiritual energy)

== Principles and terminology ==

The central theoretical ideas of ayurveda show parallels with Samkhya and Vaisheshika philosophies, as well as with Buddhism and Jainism. Balance is emphasized, and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy and claimed to lead to illness. For example, to suppress sneezing is said to potentially give rise to shoulder pain. However, people are also cautioned to stay within the limits of reasonable balance and measure when following nature&#x27;s urges. For example, emphasis is placed on moderation of food intake, sleep, and sexual intercourse.
According to ayurveda, the human body is composed of tissues (&quot;dhatus&quot;), waste (&quot;malas&quot;), and humeral biomaterials (&quot;doshas&quot;). The seven &quot;dhatus&quot; are chyle (&quot;rasa&quot;), blood (&quot;rakta&quot;), muscles (&quot;māmsa&quot;), fat (&quot;meda&quot;), bone (&quot;asthi&quot;), marrow (&quot;majja&quot;), and semen (&quot;shukra&quot;). Like the medicine of classical antiquity, the classic treatises of ayurveda divided bodily substances into five classical elements (&quot;panchamahabhuta&quot;) viz. earth, water, fire, air and ether. There are also twenty gunas (qualities or characteristics) which are considered to be inherent in all matter. These are organized in ten pairs: heavy/light, cold/hot, unctuous/dry, dull/sharp, stable/mobile, soft/hard, non-slimy/slimy, smooth/coarse, minute/gross, and viscous/liquid.

The three postulated elemental bodily humours, the &quot;doshas&quot; or &quot;tridosha&quot;, are &quot;vata&quot; (air, which some modern authors equate with the nervous system), &quot;pitta&quot; (bile, fire, equated by some with enzymes), and &quot;kapha&quot; (phlegm, or earth and water, equated by some with mucus). Contemporary critics assert that &quot;doshas&quot; are not real, but are a fictional concept. The humours (&quot;doshas&quot;) may also affect mental health. Each &quot;dosha&quot; has particular attributes and roles within the body and mind; the natural predominance of one or more &quot;doshas&quot; thus explains a person&#x27;s physical constitution (&quot;prakriti&quot;) and personality. Ayurvedic tradition holds that imbalance among the bodily and mental &quot;doshas&quot; is a major etiologic component of disease. One ayurvedic view is that the &quot;doshas&quot; are balanced when they are equal to each other, while another view is that each human possesses a unique combination of the &quot;doshas&quot; which define this person&#x27;s temperament and characteristics. In either case, it says that each person should modulate their behavior or environment to increase or decrease the &quot;doshas&quot; and maintain their natural state. Practitioners of ayurveda must determine an individual&#x27;s bodily and mental &quot;dosha&quot; makeup, as certain &quot;prakriti&quot; are said to predispose one to particular diseases. For example, a person who is thin, shy, excitable, has a pronounced Adam&#x27;s apple, and enjoys esoteric knowledge is likely &quot;vata prakriti&quot; and therefore more susceptible to conditions such as flatulence, stuttering, and rheumatism. Deranged &quot;vata&quot; is also associated with certain mental disorders due to excited or excess &quot;vayu&quot; (gas), although the ayurvedic text &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot; also attributes &quot;insanity&quot; (&quot;unmada&quot;) to cold food and possession by the ghost of a sinful Brahman (&quot;brahmarakshasa&quot;).

Ama (a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;uncooked&quot; or &quot;undigested&quot;) is used to refer to the concept of anything that exists in a state of incomplete transformation. With regards to oral hygiene, it is claimed to be a toxic byproduct generated by improper or incomplete digestion. The concept has no equivalent in standard medicine.

In medieval taxonomies of the Sanskrit knowledge systems, ayurveda is assigned a place as a subsidiary Veda (upaveda). Some medicinal plant names from the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; and other Vedas can be found in subsequent ayurveda literature. Some other school of thoughts considers &#x27;ayurveda&#x27; as the &#x27;Fifth Veda&#x27;. The earliest recorded theoretical statements about the canonical models of disease in ayurveda occur in the earliest Buddhist Canon.

== Practice ==

Ayurvedic practitioners regard physical existence, mental existence, and personality as three separate elements of a whole person with each element being able to influence the others. This holistic approach used during diagnosis and healing is a fundamental aspect of ayurveda. Another part of ayurvedic treatment says that there are channels (&quot;srotas&quot;) which transport fluids, and that the channels can be opened up by massage treatment using oils and Swedana (fomentation). Unhealthy, or blocked, channels are thought to cause disease.

=== Diagnosis ===

Ayurveda has eight ways to diagnose illness, called &quot;nadi&quot; (pulse), &quot;mootra&quot; (urine), &quot;mala&quot; (stool), &quot;jihva&quot; (tongue), &quot;shabda&quot; (speech), &quot;sparsha&quot; (touch), &quot;druk&quot; (vision), and &quot;aakruti&quot; (appearance). Ayurvedic practitioners approach diagnosis by using the five senses. For example, hearing is used to observe the condition of breathing and speech. The study of vulnerable points, or &quot;marma&quot;, is particular to ayurvedic medicine.
=== Treatment and prevention ===
Two of the eight branches of classical ayurveda deal with surgery (&quot;Śalya-cikitsā&quot; and &quot;Śālākya-tantra&quot;), but contemporary ayurveda tends to stress attaining vitality by building a healthy metabolic system and maintaining good digestion and excretion. Ayurveda also focuses on exercise, yoga, and meditation. One type of prescription is a Sattvic diet.

Ayurveda follows the concept of Dinacharya, which says that natural cycles (waking, sleeping, working, meditation etc.) are important for health. Hygiene, including regular bathing, cleaning of teeth, oil pulling, tongue scraping, skin care, and eye washing, is also a central practice.

=== Substances used ===
The vast majority (90%) of ayurvedic remedies are plant based. Plant-based treatments in ayurveda may be derived from roots, leaves, fruits, bark, or seeds; some examples of plant-based substances include cardamom and cinnamon. In the 19th century, William Dymock and co-authors summarized hundreds of plant-derived medicines along with the uses, microscopic structure, chemical composition, toxicology, prevalent myths and stories, and relation to commerce in British India. Triphala, an herbal formulation of three fruits, Amalaki, Bibhitaki, and Haritaki, is one of the most commonly used Ayurvedic remedies. The herbs &quot;Withania somnifera&quot; (Ashwagandha) and &quot;Ocimum tenuiflorum&quot; (Tulsi) are also routinely used in ayurveda.

Animal products used in ayurveda include milk, bones, and gallstones. In addition, fats are prescribed both for consumption and for external use. Consumption of minerals, including sulphur, arsenic, lead, copper sulfate and gold, are also prescribed. The addition of minerals to herbal medicine is called &quot;rasashastra&quot;.

Ayurveda uses alcoholic beverages called &quot;Madya&quot;, which are said to adjust the &quot;doshas&quot; by increasing &quot;pitta&quot; and reducing &quot;vatta&quot; and &quot;kapha&quot;. Madya are classified by the raw material and fermentation process, and the categories include: sugar-based, fruit-based, cereal-based, cereal-based with herbs, fermentated with vinegar, and tonic wines. The intended outcomes can include causing purgation, improving digestion or taste, creating dryness, or loosening joints. Ayurvedic texts describe Madya as non-viscid and fast-acting, and say that it enters and cleans minute pores in the body.

Purified opium is used in eight ayurvedic preparations and is said to balance the &quot;vata&quot; and &quot;kapha&quot; &quot;doshas&quot; and increase the &quot;pitta&quot; &quot;dosha&quot;. It is prescribed for diarrhea and dysentery, for increasing the sexual and muscular ability, and for affecting the brain. The sedative and pain-relieving properties of opium are considered in ayurveda. The use of opium is found in the ancient ayurvedic texts, and is first mentioned in the &quot;Sarngadhara Samhita&quot; (1300–1400 CE), a book on pharmacy used in Rajasthan in Western India, as an ingredient of an aphrodisiac to delay male ejaculation. It is possible that opium was brought to India along with or before Muslim conquests. The book &quot;Yoga Ratnakara&quot; (1700–1800 CE, unknown author), which is popular in Maharashtra, uses opium in a herbal-mineral composition prescribed for diarrhea. In the &quot;Bhaisajya Ratnavali&quot;, opium and camphor are used for acute gastroenteritis. In this drug, the respiratory depressant action of opium is counteracted by the respiratory stimulant property of camphor. Later books have included the narcotic property for use as analgesic pain reliever.

&quot;Cannabis indica&quot; is also mentioned in the ancient ayurveda books, and is first mentioned in the &quot;Sarngadhara Samhita&quot; as a treatment for diarrhea. In the &quot;Bhaisajya Ratnavali&quot; it is named as an ingredient in an aphrodisiac.

Ayurveda says that both oil and tar can be used to stop bleeding, and that traumatic bleeding can be stopped by four different methods: ligation of the blood vessel, cauterisation by heat, use of preparations to facilitate clotting, and use of preparations to constrict the blood vessels.

Massage with oil is commonly prescribed by ayurvedic practitioners. Oils are used in a number of ways, including regular consumption, anointing, smearing, head massage, application to affected areas, and oil pulling. Liquids may also be poured on the patient&#x27;s forehead, a technique called shirodhara.

=== Panchakarma ===

According to ayurveda, panchakarma are techniques to eliminate toxic elements from the body. Panchakarma refers to five actions, which are meant to be performed in a designated sequence with the stated aim of restoring balance in the body through a process of purgation.

== Current status ==
Ayurveda is widely practiced in India and Nepal where public institutions offer formal study in the form of a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) degree. In certain parts of the world, the legal standing of practitioners is equivalent to that of conventional medicine. Several scholars have described the contemporary Indian application of ayurvedic practice as being &quot;biomedicalized&quot; relative to the more &quot;spiritualized&quot; emphasis to practice found in variants in the West.

Exposure to European developments in medicine from the nineteenth century onwards, through European colonization of India and the subsequent institutionalized support for European forms of medicine amongst European heritage settlers in India were challenging to ayurveda, with the entire epistemology called into question. From the twentieth century, ayurveda became politically, conceptually, and commercially dominated by modern biomedicine, resulting in &quot;modern ayurveda&quot; and &quot;global ayurveda&quot;. Modern ayurveda is geographically located in the Indian subcontinent and tends towards secularization through minimization of the magic and mythic aspects of ayurveda. Global ayurveda encompasses multiple forms of practice that developed through dispersal to a wide geographical area outside of India. Smith and Wujastyk further delineate that global ayurveda includes those primarily interested in the ayurveda pharmacopeia, and also the practitioners of New Age ayurveda (which may link ayurveda to yoga and Indian spirituality and/or emphasize preventative practice, mind body medicine, or Maharishi ayurveda).

Since the 1980s, ayurveda has also become the subject of interdisciplinary studies in ethnomedicine which seeks to integrate the biomedical sciences and humanities to improve the pharmacopeia of ayurveda. According to industry research, the global ayurveda market was worth US$4.5 billion in 2017.

=== The Indian subcontinent ===
==== India ====

It was reported in 2008 and again in 2018 that 80 percent of people in India used ayurveda exclusively or combined with conventional Western medicine. A 2014 national health survey found that, in general, forms of the Indian system of medicine or AYUSH (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha, and homeopathy) were used by about 3.5% of patients who were seeking outpatient care over a two-week reference period.

In 1970, the Parliament of India passed the Indian Medical Central Council Act which aimed to standardise qualifications for ayurveda practitioners and provide accredited institutions for its study and research. In 1971, the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) was established under the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha medicine and Homoeopathy (AYUSH), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to monitor higher education in ayurveda in India. The Indian government supports research and teaching in ayurveda through many channels at both the national and state levels, and helps institutionalise traditional medicine so that it can be studied in major towns and cities. The state-sponsored Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) is designed to do research on ayurveda. Many clinics in urban and rural areas are run by professionals who qualify from these institutes. , India had over 180 training centers that offered degrees in traditional ayurvedic medicine.

To fight biopiracy and unethical patents, the government of India set up the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library in 2001 to serve as a repository for formulations from systems of Indian medicine, such as ayurveda, unani and siddha medicine. The formulations come from over 100 traditional ayurveda books.
An Indian Academy of Sciences document quoting a 2003–04 report states that India had 432,625 registered medical practitioners, 13,925 dispensaries, 2,253 hospitals and a bed strength of 43,803. 209 undergraduate teaching institutions and 16 postgraduate institutions. In 2012, it was reported that insurance companies covered expenses for ayurvedic treatments in case of conditions such as spinal cord disorders, bone disorder, arthritis and cancer. Such claims constituted 5–10 percent of the country&#x27;s health insurance claims.

Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, an organisation dedicated to fighting superstition in India, considers ayurveda to be pseudoscience.

On 9 November 2014, India formed the Ministry of AYUSH. National Ayurveda Day is also observed in India on the birth of Dhanvantari that is Dhanteras.

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a report titled &quot;The Health Workforce in India&quot; which found that 31 percent of those who claimed to be doctors in India in 2001 were educated only up to the secondary school level and 57 percent went without any medical qualification. The WHO study found that the situation was worse in rural India with only 18.8 percent of doctors holding a medical qualification. Overall, the study revealed that nationally the density of all doctors (mainstream, ayurvedic, homeopathic and unani) was 8 doctors per 10,000 people compared to 13 per 10,000 people in China.

==== Nepal ====
About 75% to 80% of the population of Nepal use ayurveda. As of 2009, ayurveda was considered to be the most common and popular form of medicine in Nepal.

==== Sri Lanka ====
The Sri Lankan tradition of ayurveda is similar to the Indian tradition. Practitioners of ayurveda in Sri Lanka refer to Sanskrit texts which are common to both countries. However, they do differ in some aspects, particularly in the herbs used.

In 1980, the Sri Lankan government established a Ministry of Indigenous Medicine to revive and regulate ayurveda. The Institute of Indigenous Medicine (affiliated to the University of Colombo) offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and MD degrees in ayurveda medicine and surgery, and similar degrees in unani medicine. In 2010, the public system had 62 ayurvedic hospitals and 208 central dispensaries, which served about 3 million people (about 11% of Sri Lanka&#x27;s population). There are an estimated 20,000 registered practitioners of ayurveda in Sri Lanka.

According to the Mahavamsa, an ancient chronicle of Sinhalese royalty from the sixth century CE, King Pandukabhaya (reigned 437 BCE to 367 BCE) had lying-in-homes and ayurvedic hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country. This is the earliest documented evidence available of institutions dedicated specifically to the care of the sick anywhere in the world. The hospital at Mihintale is the oldest in the world.

=== Outside the Indian subcontinent ===

Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine developed during antiquity and the medieval period, and as such is comparable to pre-modern Chinese and European systems of medicine. In the 1960s, ayurveda began to be advertised as alternative medicine in the Western world. Due to different laws and medical regulations around the globe, the expanding practice and commercialisation of ayurveda raised ethical and legal issues. Ayurveda was adapted for Western consumption, particularly by Baba Hari Dass in the 1970s and by Maharishi Ayurveda in the 1980s. In some cases, this involved active fraud on the part of proponents of ayurveda in an attempt to falsely represent the system as equal to the standards of modern medical research.

==== United States ====
Baba Hari Dass was an early proponent who helped bring ayurveda to the United States in the early 1970s. His teachings led to the establishment of the Mount Madonna Institute. He invited several notable ayurvedic teachers, including Vasant Lad, Sarita Shrestha, and Ram Harsh Singh. The ayurvedic practitioner Michael Tierra wrote that the &quot;history of Ayurveda in North America will always owe a debt to the selfless contributions of Baba Hari Dass&quot;.

In the United States, the practice of ayurveda is not licensed or regulated by any state. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) stated that &quot;Few well-designed clinical trials and systematic research reviews suggest that Ayurvedic approaches are effective&quot;. The NCCIH warned against the issue of heavy metal poisoning, and emphasised the use of conventional health providers first. As of 2018, the NCCIH reported that 240,000 Americans were using ayurvedic medicine.

==== Europe ====
The first ayurvedic clinic in Switzerland was opened in 1987 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In 2015, the government of Switzerland introduced a federally recognized diploma in ayurveda.

== Classification and efficacy ==
Ayurvedic medicine is considered pseudoscientific because its premises are not based on science. Both the lack of scientific soundness in the theoretical foundations of ayurveda and the quality of research have been criticized.

Although laboratory experiments suggest that some herbs and substances in ayurveda might be developed into effective treatments, there is no evidence that any are effective in themselves. There is no good evidence that ayurvedic medicine is effective to treat or cure cancer in people. Although ayurveda may help &quot;improve quality of life&quot; and Cancer Research UK also acknowledges that &quot;researchers have found that some Ayurvedic treatments can help relieve cancer symptoms&quot;, the organization warns that some ayurvedic drugs contain toxic substances or may interact with legitimate cancer drugs in a harmful way.

Ethnologist Johannes Quack writes that although the rationalist movement Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti officially labels ayurveda a pseudoscience akin to astrology, these practices are in fact embraced by many of the movement&#x27;s members.

A review of the use of ayurveda for cardiovascular disease concluded that the evidence is not convincing for the use of any ayurvedic herbal treatment for heart disease or hypertension, but that many herbs used by ayurvedic practitioners could be appropriate for further research.

=== Research ===

In India, research in ayurveda is undertaken by the Ministry of AYUSH through a national network of research institutes.

In Nepal, the National Ayurvedic Training and Research Centre (NATRC) researches medicinal herbs in the country.

In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine looks after the research in ayurveda through various national research institutes.

==== Use of toxic metals ====
&quot;Rasashastra&quot;, the practice of adding metals, minerals or gems to herbal preparations, may include toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic. The public health implications of metals in &quot;rasashastra&quot; in India is unknown. Adverse reactions to herbs are described in traditional ayurvedic texts, but practitioners are reluctant to admit that herbs could be toxic and that reliable information on herbal toxicity is not readily available. There is a communication gap between practitioners of medicine and ayurveda.
Traditional Indian herbal medicinal products have been found to contain harmful levels of heavy metals, including lead. For example, ghasard, a product commonly given to infants for digestive issues, has been found to have up to 1.6% lead concentration by weight, leading to lead encephalopathy. A 1990 study on ayurvedic medicines in India found that 41% of the products tested contained arsenic, and that 64% contained lead and mercury. A 2004 study found toxic levels of heavy metals in 20% of ayurvedic preparations made in South Asia and sold in the Boston area, and concluded that ayurvedic products posed serious health risks and should be tested for heavy-metal contamination. A 2008 study of more than 230 products found that approximately 20% of remedies (and 40% of &quot;rasashastra&quot; medicines) purchased over the Internet from U.S. and Indian suppliers contained lead, mercury or arsenic. A 2015 study of users in the United States found elevated blood lead levels in 40% of those tested, leading physician and former U.S. Air Force flight surgeon Harriet Hall to say that &quot;Ayurveda is basically superstition mixed with a soupçon of practical health advice. And it can be dangerous.&quot; A 2022 study found that ayurvedic preparations purchased over-the-counter in Chandigarh, India, had levels of zinc, mercury, arsenic and lead over the limits set by the Food and Agriculture Organisation / World Health Organisation. 83% exceeded the limit for zinc, 69% for mercury, 14% for arsenic and 5% for lead. In 2023, the Victorian Department of Health issued a health advisory warning that unregulated ayurvedic products sold in the state may contain unsafe levels of lead, mercury and arsenic, as well as harmful compounds from the plants &quot;Azadirachta indica&quot; and &quot;Acorus calamus&quot;.

Heavy metals are thought of as active ingredients by advocates of Indian herbal medicinal products. According to ancient ayurvedic texts, certain physico-chemical purification processes such as &quot;samskaras&quot; or &quot;shodhanas&quot; (for metals) &#x27;detoxify&#x27; the heavy metals in it. These are similar to the Chinese &quot;pao zhi&quot;, although the ayurvedic techniques are more complex and may involve physical pharmacy techniques as well as mantras. However, these products have nonetheless caused severe lead poisoning and other toxic effects. Between 1978 and 2008, &quot;more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with Ayurvedic medicine use [were] reported worldwide&quot;. In 2012, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) linked ayurvedic drugs to lead poisoning, based on cases where toxic materials were found in the blood of pregnant women who had taken ayurvedic drugs.

Ayurvedic practitioners argue that the toxicity of bhasmas (ash products) comes from improper manufacturing processes, contaminants, improper use of ayurvedic medicine, quality of raw materials and that the end products and improper procedures are used by charlatans.

In India, the government ruled that ayurvedic products must be labelled with their metallic content. However, in &quot;Current Science&quot;, a publication of the Indian Academy of Sciences, M. S. Valiathan said that &quot;the absence of post-market surveillance and the paucity of test laboratory facilities [in India] make the quality control of Ayurvedic medicines exceedingly difficult at this time&quot;. In the United States, most ayurvedic products are marketed without having been reviewed or approved by the FDA. Since 2007, the FDA has placed an import alert on some ayurvedic products in order to prevent them from entering the United States. A 2012 toxicological review of mercury-based traditional herbo-metallic preparations concluded that the long-term pharmacotherapeutic and in-depth toxicity studies of these preparations are lacking.

== History ==

Some scholars assert that the concepts of traditional ayurvedic medicine have existed since the times of the Indus Valley civilisation but since the Indus script has not been deciphered, such assertions are moot. The Atharvaveda contains hymns and prayers aimed at curing disease. There are various legendary accounts of the origin of ayurveda, such as that it was received by Dhanvantari (or Divodasa) from Brahma. Tradition also holds that the writings of ayurveda were influenced by a lost text by the sage Agnivesha.

Ayurveda is one of the few systems of medicine developed in ancient times that is still widely practised in modern times. As such, it is open to the criticism that its conceptual basis is obsolete and that its contemporary practitioners have not taken account of the developments in medicine. Responses to this situation led to an impassioned debate in India during the early decades of the twentieth century, between proponents of unchanging tradition (&quot;śuddha&quot; &quot;pure&quot; ayurveda) and those who thought ayurveda should modernize and syncretize (&quot;aśuddha&quot; &quot;impure, tainted&quot; ayurveda). The political debate about the place of ayurveda in contemporary India has continued to the present, both in the public arena and in government. Debate about the place of ayurvedic medicine in the contemporary internationalized world also continues today.

=== Main texts ===
Many ancient works on ayurvedic medicine are lost to posterity, but manuscripts of three principal early texts on ayurveda have survived to the present day. These works are the Charaka Samhita, the Sushruta Samhita and the Bhela Samhita. The dating of these works is historically complicated since they each internally present themselves as composite works compiled by several editors. All past scholarship on their dating has been evaluated by Meulenbeld in volumes IA and IB of his &quot;History of Indian Medical Literature&quot;. After considering the evidence and arguments concerning the &quot;Suśrutasaṃhitā&quot;, Meulenbeld stated (IA, 348), The &quot;Suśrutasaṃhitā&quot; is most probably the work of an unknown author who drew much of the material he incorporated in his treatise from a multiplicity of earlier sources from various periods. This may explain that many scholars yield to the temptation to recognize a number of distinct layers and, consequently, try to identify elements belonging to them. As we have seen, the identification of features thought to belong to a particular stratum is in many cases determined by preconceived ideas on the age of the strata and their supposed authors. The dating of this work to 600 BCE was first proposed by Hoernle over a century ago, but has long since been overturned by subsequent historical research. The current consensus amongst medical historians of South Asia is that the &quot;Suśrutasaṃhitā&quot; was compiled over a period of time starting with a kernel of medical ideas from the century or two BCE and then being revised by several hands into its present form by about 500 CE. The view that the text was updated by the Buddhist scholar Nagarjuna in the 2nd century CE has been disproved, although the last chapter of the work, the Uttaratantra, was added by an unknown later author before 500 CE.

Similar arguments apply to the Charaka Samhita, written by Charaka, and the Bhela Samhita, attributed to Atreya Punarvasu, that are also dated to the 6th century BCE by non-specialist scholars but are in fact, in their present form, datable to a period between the second and fifth centuries CE. The Charaka Samhita was also updated by Dridhabala during the early centuries of the Common Era.

The Bower Manuscript (dated to the early 6th century CE) includes of excerpts from the &quot;Bheda Samhita&quot; and its description of concepts in Central Asian Buddhism. In 1987, A. F. R. Hoernle identified the scribe of the medical portions of the manuscript to be a native of India using a northern variant of the Gupta script, who had migrated and become a Buddhist monk in a monastery in Kucha. The Chinese pilgrim Fa Hsien (c. 337–422 CE) wrote about the healthcare system of the Gupta empire (320–550) and described the institutional approach of Indian medicine. This is also visible in the works of Charaka, who describes hospitals and how they should be equipped.

Some dictionaries of materia medica include &quot;Astanga nighantu&quot; (8th century) by Vagbhata, &quot;Paryaya ratnamala&quot; (9th century) by Madhava, &quot;Siddhasara nighantu&quot; (9th century) by Ravi Gupta, &quot;Dravyavali &quot;(10th century), and &quot;Dravyaguna sangraha&quot; (11th century) by Chakrapani Datta, among others.

=== Illnesses portrayed ===
Underwood and Rhodes state that the early forms of traditional Indian medicine identified fever, cough, consumption, diarrhea, dropsy, abscesses, seizures, tumours, and leprosy, and that treatments included plastic surgery, lithotomy, tonsillectomy, couching (a form of cataract surgery), puncturing to release fluids in the abdomen, extraction of foreign bodies, treatment of anal fistulas, treating fractures, amputations, cesarean sections, and stitching of wounds. The use of herbs and surgical instruments became widespread. During this period, treatments were also prescribed for complex ailments, including angina pectoris, diabetes, hypertension, and stones.

=== Further development and spread ===

Ayurveda flourished throughout the Indian Middle Ages. Dalhana (fl. 1200), Sarngadhara (fl. 1300) and Bhavamisra (fl. 1500) compiled works on Indian medicine. The medical works of both Sushruta and Charaka were also translated into the Chinese language in the 5th century, and during the 8th century, they were translated into the Arabic and Persian language. The 9th-century Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi was familiar with the text. The Arabic works derived from the ayurvedic texts eventually also reached Europe by the 12th century. In Renaissance Italy, the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi (Bologna) were influenced by the Arabic reception of the Sushruta&#x27;s surgical techniques.

British physicians traveled to India to observe rhinoplasty being performed using Indian methods, and reports on their rhinoplasty methods were published in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1794. Instruments described in the &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; were further modified in Europe. Joseph Constantine Carpue studied plastic surgery methods in India for 20 years and, in 1815, was able to perform the first major rhinoplasty surgery in the western world, using the &quot;Indian&quot; method of nose reconstruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lock651/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840 Brett published an article about this technique.

The British had shown some interest in understanding local medicinal practices in the early nineteenth century. A Native Medical Institution was setup in 1822 where both indigenous and European medicine were taught. After the English Education Act 1835, their policy changed to champion European medicine and disparage local practices. After Indian independence, there was more focus on ayurveda and other traditional medical systems. Ayurveda became a part of the Indian National healthcare system, with state hospitals for ayurveda established across the country. However, the treatments of traditional medicines were not always integrated with others.

<text>James McDonald Vicary (April 30, 1915 – November 7, 1977) was an American market researcher who pioneered the concept of subliminal advertising with an experiment in 1957, later determined to have been fraudulent. Vicary was unable to ever reproduce the results of his experiments. In 1962, Vicary finally admitted that his subliminal &quot;experiment&quot; had been concocted as a gimmick to attract customers to his failing marketing business.

==Biography==
Born in Detroit, and trained at the University of Michigan (A.B 1940), he pioneered the use of eye-blink analysis to obtain clues about subjects&#x27; levels of emotional tension when exposed to various stimuli. He also studied the phenomena of impulse buying and word association.

He was also known to have a childhood fascination with snakes, and was called Detroit&#x27;s youngest snake charmer by &quot;The Detroit News&quot;.

Vicary became famous for perpetrating a fraudulent subliminal advertising study in 1957. In it, he claimed that an experiment in which moviegoers were repeatedly shown 1/3000-second advertisements for Coca-Cola and popcorn significantly increased product sales. Based on his claims the CIA produced a report &quot;The operational potential of subliminal perception&quot; in 1958 that led to subliminal cuts being banned in the US. It suggested that &quot;Certain individuals can at certain times and under certain circumstances be influenced to act abnormally without awareness of the influence&quot;.

When challenged later to replicate the study, Vicary failed to produce significant results. He provided no explanations for his results or any other details about his study to the public, claiming that it was part of a confidential patent. When Stuart Rogers interviewed people from the theater that supposedly conducted this experiment, the manager declared that no such test was ever done (Rogers 1992)
In a television interview with Fred Danzig in 1962 for &quot;Advertising Age&quot;, Vicary admitted that the original study was &quot;a gimmick&quot; and that the amount of data was &quot;too small to be meaningful&quot;. He shied away from media attention after the disclosure. Numerous commentaries have appeared on this affair since 1957.

Vicary&#x27;s papers are held by the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut in Storrs.

==Popcorn experiment==

One of the most commonly known examples of subliminal messaging is Vicary&#x27;s claimed movie theater experiment in 1957, purportedly in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In his press release, he claimed that 45,699 people were exposed to subliminal projections telling them to &quot;Eat Popcorn&quot; and &quot;Drink Coca-Cola&quot;, causing a 57.5 percent sales increase for popcorn and an 18.1 percent increase in Coca-Cola sales. Vicary provided no explanations for his results, making it impossible to reproduce them. Taken together with evidence that no experiment even took place, Vicary&#x27;s results can be considered completely fraudulent. Vicary later retracted his claims in a television interview, but his original claims spread rapidly, and led to widespread and continuing belief that subliminal messaging is real.

<doc id="236680" wikidata="Q51549" url="?curid=236680" title="Jacques Tati">
<text>Jacques Tati (; born Jacques Tatischeff, ; 9 October 1907 – 5 November 1982) was a French mime, filmmaker, actor and screenwriter. In an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; poll of the Greatest Movie Directors, he was voted the 46th greatest of all time (out of 50), although he directed only six feature-length films.

Tati is perhaps best known for his character Monsieur Hulot, featured in &quot;Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot&quot; (1953), &quot;Mon Oncle&quot; (1958), &quot;Playtime&quot; (1967) and &quot;Trafic&quot; (1971). &quot;Playtime&quot; ranked 23rd in the 2022 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the greatest films ever made.

As David Bellos puts it, &quot;Tati, from &quot;l&#x27;École des facteurs&quot; to &quot;Playtime&quot;, is the epitome of what an &quot;auteur&quot; is (in film theory) supposed to be: the controlling mind behind a vision of the world on film&quot;.

==Family origins==
Tati was of Russian, Dutch, and Italian ancestry. His father, Georges-Emmanuel Tatischeff (1875-1957), was born in Paris, the son of Dmitry Tatishcheff (Дмитрий Татищев; also spelled Tatishchev), General of the Imperial Russian Army and military attaché to the Russian embassy in Paris. The Tatischeffs were a Russian noble family of patrilineal Rurikid descent. Whilst stationed in Paris, Dmitri Tatischeff married a French woman, Rose Anathalie Alinquant (Russian sources indicate that Alinquant was a circus performer and that the couple were never actually married).

Dmitri Tatischeff died under suspicious circumstances from injuries sustained in a horse-riding accident, shortly after the birth of Georges-Emmanuel. As a child, Georges-Emmanuel experienced turbulent times, such as being forcibly removed from France and taken to live in Russia. In 1883, his mother brought him back to France, where they settled on the estate of Le Pecq, near Saint-Germain-en-Laye, on the outskirts of Paris. In 1903, Georges-Emmanuel Tatischeff married the Dutch-Italian Marcelle Claire van Hoof (died 1968). Together, they had two children, Natalie (born 1905) and Jacques. Claire&#x27;s Dutch father, a friend of van Gogh, whose clients included Toulouse-Lautrec, was the owner of a prestigious picture-framing company near the Place Vendôme in Paris, and he brought Georges-Emmanuel into the family business. Subsequently, Georges-Emmanuel became the director of the company Cadres Van Hoof, and the Tatischeff family enjoyed a relatively high standard of living.

==Early life==
Tati seems to have been an indifferent student, yet excelled in tennis and horse riding. He left school in 1923, at the age of 16, and his grandfather trained him as a picture framer in the family business. Between 1927 and 1928, he completed his national military service at Saint-Germain-en-Laye with the Cavalry&#x27;s 16th Regiment of Dragoons. On leaving the military, he took on an apprenticeship in London, where he was first introduced to rugby. Returning to Paris, he joined the semi-professional rugby team Racing Club de France, captained by Alfred Sauvy, and whose supporters included Tristan Bernard. It was there that he first discovered his comic talents, entertaining his teammates during intervals with impersonations of their sporting endeavours. He also first met Jacques Broido, with whom he became lifelong friends.

The global economic crisis reached France in 1931–32. Tati left both the Racing Club de France, and to his family&#x27;s disapproval, his apprenticeship at Cadres Van Hoof. Giving up a relatively comfortable middle-class lifestyle to be a struggling performing artist during hard economic times, he developed a collection of highly physical mime routines that would become his &quot;Impressions Sportives&quot; (&quot;Sporting Impressions&quot;). Each year from 1931 to 1934, he participated in an amateur show organised by Alfred Sauvy.

==Career==
===Early work===
Although he had likely played music hall engagements before, his act was first mentioned in 1935, when he performed at the gala for the newspaper &quot;Le Journal&quot;, celebrating the French victory in setting the transatlantic crossing record from Normandy. Among the honourable spectators was the influential writer Colette. Tati&#x27;s act also caught the attention of Max Trebor, who offered him an engagement at the Theatre-Michel, where he quickly became the star act. After his success there, Tati tried to make it in London, playing a short season at the Finsbury Park Empire in March 1936. Upon his return to Paris in the same year, he was immediately hired as top billing at the ABC Théâtre, alongside the singer Marie Dubas, where he would work uninterrupted until the outbreak of the Second World War. It was for Tati&#x27;s performances of his now-finely tuned &quot;Impressions Sportives&quot; at the ABC that the previously impressed Colette wrote,

&quot;From now on no celebration, no artistic or acrobatic spectacle can do without this amazing performer, who has invented something quite his own ... His act is partly ballet and partly sport, partly satire and partly a charade. He has devised a way of being both the player, the ball and the tennis racquet, of being simultaneously the football and the goalkeeper, the boxer and his opponent, the bicycle and the cyclist. Without any props, he conjures up his accessories and his partners. He has suggestive powers of all great artists. How gratifying it was to see the audience&#x27;s warm reaction! Tati&#x27;s success says a lot about the sophistication of the allegedly &quot;uncouth&quot; public, about its taste for novelty and its appreciation of style. Jacques Tati, the horse and rider conjured, will show all of Paris the living image of that legendary creature, the centaur.&quot;

From 1937 to 1938, he performed at the (former ) in Berlin.

During the 1930s, he began to experiment with film, acting in the following shorts:

*&quot;Oscar, champion de tennis&quot; (1932). Directed by Jack Forrester; written by and starring Jacques Tati (film lost).
*&quot;On demande une brute&quot; (1934). Directed by Charles Barrois; featuring Jacques Tati as &quot;Roger&quot; and Enrico Sprocani as &quot;le clown Rhum (Enrico)&quot;.
*&quot;Gai dimanche&quot; (1935). Directed by Jacques Berr; written by and starring Jacques Tati, and featuring Enrico Sprocani.
*&quot;Soigne ton gauche&quot; (1936). Directed by René Clément; starring Jacques Tati as &quot;Roger&quot;, with Jacques Broido as &quot;Sparring Partner&quot;, and Max Martel as &quot;The Postman&quot;.

===World War II and postwar employment===
In September 1939, Tati was conscripted back into his 16th Regiment of Dragoons, which was then incorporated into the 3rd Division Legere de Cavalerie (DLC). He saw action in the Battle of Sedan in May 1940, when the German Army marched through the Ardennes into northern France. The 3rd DLC retreated from Meuse to Mussidan, in the Dordogne, where the division was demobilised after the Armistice was declared on 22 June 1940.

Returning to Paris, Tati resumed his civilian profession as a cabaret performer, finding employment by at Le Lido, where he performed his &quot;Sporting Impressions&quot; from 1940 to 1942.

Considered as a possible substitute for Jean-Louis Barrault in &quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot;, Tati played the ghost in &quot;Sylvie and the Ghost&quot;, alongside Odette Joyeux as Sylvie, and also appeared as The Devil in the same film. Here, he met Fred Orain, studio director of St. Maurice and the Victorine in Nice.

===Tati as director===
In early 1946, Jacques Tati and Fred Orain founded the production company Cady-Films, which would produce Tati&#x27;s first three films.

With the exception of his first and last films, Tati played the gauche and socially inept lead character, Monsieur Hulot. With his trademark raincoat, umbrella and pipe, Hulot is among the most memorable comic characters in cinema. Several themes recur in Tati&#x27;s work, most notably in &quot;Mon Oncle&quot;, &quot;Playtime&quot;, and &quot;Trafic&quot;. They include Western society&#x27;s obsession with material goods, particularly American-style consumerism, the pressure-cooker environment of modern society, the superficiality of relationships among France&#x27;s various social classes, and the cold and often impractical nature of space-age technology and design.

===&quot;L&#x27;École des facteurs&quot; (&quot;The School for Postmen&quot;)===
René Clément was first approached to direct &quot;L&#x27;École des facteurs&quot; (1947), but as he was preoccupied directing &quot;La Bataille du rail&quot; (1946), directing duties fell to Tati, who also starred in this short comedy about rural life. Encouragingly, &quot;L&#x27;École des facteurs&quot; was enthusiastically well-received upon release, winning the Max Linder Prize for film comedy in 1947.

===&quot;Jour de fête&quot; (&quot;The Big Day&quot;)===
Tati&#x27;s first major feature, &quot;Jour de fête&quot; (&quot;The Big Day&quot;), is about an inept rural village postman who interrupts his duties to inspect the traveling fair that has come to town. Influenced by too much wine and a documentary on the rapidity of the American postal service, he goes to hilarious lengths to speed his mail deliveries aboard his bicycle. Tati filmed it in 1947 in the village of Sainte-Sévère-sur-Indre, where he had found refuge during the war. Due to the reluctance of French distributors, &quot;Jour de fête&quot; was first successfully released in London in March 1949, before obtaining a French release on 4 July 1949, where it became a great public success, receiving the 1950 Le Grand prix du cinéma français. The film was intended to be the first French feature film shot in colour; Tati simultaneously shot the film in black and white as an insurance policy. The newly developed Thomson colour system proved impractical, as it could not deliver colour prints. &quot;Jour de fête&quot; was therefore released only in black and white. Unlike his later films, it has many scenes with dialogue, and offers a droll, affectionate view of life in rural France. The colour version was restored by his daughter, film editor and director Sophie Tatischeff, and released in 1995. The film won the Prize for Best Original Script at the Venice Film Festival.

===&quot;Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot&quot; (&quot;Monsieur Hulot&#x27;s Holiday&quot;)===
Tati&#x27;s second film, &quot;Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot&quot; (&quot;Monsieur Hulot&#x27;s Holiday&quot;), was released in 1953. &quot;Les Vacances&quot; introduced the character of Mr. Hulot and follows his adventures in France during the mandatory August vacation at a beach resort, lampooning several hidebound elements of French political and social classes. It was shot almost entirely in the tiny west coast seaside village of Saint-Marc-sur-Mer, in the Loire Atlantique region. The hotel in which Mr. Hulot stays (l&#x27;Hôtel de la Plage) is still there, and a statue memorialising the director has been erected on the beach. Tati had fallen in love with the coast while staying in nearby Port Charlotte with his friends, Mr. and Mrs. Lemoine, before the war, and resolved to return one day to make a film there. The film was widely praised by critics, and earned Tati an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, which was shared with Henri Marquet. Production of the movie also reintroduced Jacques Lagrange into Tati&#x27;s life, beginning a lifelong working partnership with the painter, who would become his set designer. &quot;Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot&quot; remains one of the best-loved French films of that period. The film&#x27;s comic influence has extended well beyond France and can be found as recently as 2007 in the Rowan Atkinson comic vehicle &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot;.

André Bazin, founder of the influential journal &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, wrote in his 1957 essay, &quot;Fifteen Years of French Cinema&quot;:

&quot;Tati could easily have made lots of money with sequels featuring his comic character of the little rural mailman. He chose instead to wait for four years, and, after much reflection, he revised his formula completely. The result this time was an extraordinary masterpiece about which one can say, I think, that it is the most radical innovation in comic cinema since the Marx Brothers: I am referring, of course, to &quot;Les Vacances de M. Hulot&quot;.&quot;

Various problems delayed the release of Tati&#x27;s follow-up to his international hit. In 1955, he suffered a serious car accident that physically impaired his left hand. Then, a dispute with Fred Orain ensued, and Tati broke away from Cady Films to create his own production company, Spectra Films, in 1956.

===&quot;Mon Oncle&quot; (&quot;My Uncle&quot;)===
Tati&#x27;s next film, 1958&#x27;s &quot;Mon Oncle&quot; (&quot;My Uncle&quot;), was his first film to be released in colour. The plot centers on Mr. Hulot&#x27;s comedic, quixotic, and childlike struggle with postwar France&#x27;s obsession with modernity and American-style consumerism, entwined with the relationship he has with his nine-year-old nephew, Gérard. &quot;Mon Oncle&quot; quickly became an international success, and won that year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, a Special Prize at Cannes, as well as the New York Film Critics Award. In Place de la Pelouse (Saint-Maur-des-Fossés), there stands a bronze statue of Tati as Monsieur Hulot talking to a boy, in a pose echoing the movie&#x27;s poster, which was designed by Pierre Étaix.

On receiving his Oscar, Tati was offered any treat that the Academy could bestow on him. To their surprise, Tati simply requested the opportunity to visit Stan Laurel, Mack Sennett, and Buster Keaton. Keaton reportedly said that Tati&#x27;s work with sound had carried on the true tradition of silent cinema.

As guest artistic director at AFI Fest 2010, David Lynch selected Tati&#x27;s &quot;Mon Oncle&quot;, alongside &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot; (dir. Ingmar Bergman, 1968), &quot;Lolita&quot; (dir. Stanley Kubrick, 1962), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (dir. Alfred Hitchcock, 1954) and &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (dir. Billy Wilder, 1950) to be screened in his sidebar program, explaining:

&quot;I picked these particular films because they are the ones that have inspired me most. I think each is a masterpiece.&quot;

===&quot;Playtime&quot;===
&quot;Playtime&quot; (1967), shot in 70mm, was to be the most ambitious yet risky and expensive work of Tati&#x27;s career.

In an essay for the Criterion Collection, Kent Jones wrote:

&quot;Playtime&quot; took nine years to make, and Tati had to borrow heavily from his own resources to complete the picture. At the time of its making, &quot;Playtime&quot; (1967) was the most expensive film in French history. Of the film, Tati said: &quot;&quot;Play Time&quot; [sic] is the big leap, the big screen. I&#x27;m putting myself on the line. Either it comes off or it doesn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s no safety net.&quot; Tati famously built an entire glass and steel mini-city (nicknamed Tativille) on the outskirts of Paris for the film, which took years to build and left him mired in debt.

In the film, Hulot and a group of American tourists lose themselves in the futuristic glass and steel of the commercially globalised modern Parisian suburbs, where only human nature and a few reflective views of the old city of Paris itself still emerge to breathe life into the sterile new metropolis. &quot;Playtime&quot; had even less of a plot than Tati&#x27;s earlier films, and he endeavored to make his characters, including Hulot, almost incidental to his portrayal of a modernist and robotic Paris.

&quot;Playtime&quot; was originally 155 minutes in length, but Tati soon released an edited version of 126 minutes; this is the version that was generally released to theatres in 1967. Later versions appeared in 35mm format. In 1979, a copy of the film was revised again to 108 minutes, and this re-edited version was released on VHS video in 1984. Though &quot;Playtime&quot; was a critical success (François Truffaut praised it as &quot;a film that comes from another planet, where they make films differently&quot;), it was a massive and expensive commercial failure, eventually resulting in Tati&#x27;s bankruptcy.

Tati biographer David Bellos noted that Tati had approached everybody from Darryl F. Zanuck to French prime minister Georges Pompidou in a bid to get the film completed. &quot;His personal overdrafts began to mount, and long before &quot;Play Time&quot; was finished, Tati was in substantial debt to the least forgiving of all creditors, the Collectors of Taxes.&quot; When Tati failed to pay off his loans, his films were impounded by the banks. Tati was forced to sell the family house of Saint-Germain shortly after the death of his mother, Claire van Hoof, and move back into Paris. Spectra Films was placed into administration, concluding in the liquidation of the company in 1974, with an auction of all film rights held by the company for little more than 120,000 francs.

In 1969, with reduced means, Tati created a new production company, CEPEC, to oversee his opportunities in film and TV production.

====Spin-offs of &quot;Playtime&quot;====
While on the set of &quot;Playtime&quot;, Tati made a short film about his comedic and cinematic technique, &quot;Cours du soir&quot; (&quot;Evening Classes&quot;, 1967), in which he gives a lesson in the art of comedy to a class of would-be actors.

In 1971, Tati made an advertisement for England&#x27;s Lloyds Bank, in which he depicted a dehumanized bank of the future, with money dispensed by a computerized counter. &quot;The message of the advert was that however modern Lloyds are, technology isn&#x27;t everything and you&#x27;ll always be able to speak to a &quot;friendly member of staff or understanding manager&quot; in their branches&quot;.

====Reception====
In August 2012, the British Film Institute polled 846 critics, programmers, academics, and distributors to find &quot;The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time&quot;; &quot;Playtime&quot; was voted 42nd. In the corresponding &quot;Directors Poll&quot; by the BFI, &quot;Playtime&quot; was awarded the accolade of being seen as the 37th greatest film of all time by his fellow directors.

Steven Spielberg has said he was paying a &quot;very slight homage&quot; to &quot;Playtime&quot; in his 2004 film &quot;The Terminal&quot;, adding, &quot;I thought of two directors when I made [&quot;The Terminal&quot;]. I thought this was a tribute to Frank Capra and his honest sentiment, and it was a tribute to Jacques Tati and the way he allowed his scenes to go on and on and on. The character he played in &quot;Monsieur Hulot&#x27;s Holiday&quot; and &quot;Mon Oncle&quot; was all about resourcefulness and using what&#x27;s around him to make us laugh&quot;.

===&quot;Trafic&quot; (&quot;Traffic&quot;)===
The Dutch-funded &quot;Trafic&quot; (&quot;Traffic&quot;), although originally designed to be a TV film, received a theatrical release in 1971, and placed Monsieur Hulot back at the centre of the action. It was the last Hulot film, and followed the vein of earlier works that lampooned modern society. In the film, Hulot is a bumbling automobile inventor, who is traveling to an exhibition in a gadget-filled recreational vehicle.

===&quot;Parade&quot;===
Tati&#x27;s last completed film, &quot;Parade&quot;, a film produced for Swedish television in 1973, is more or less a filmed circus performance, featuring Tati&#x27;s mime acts and other performers.

===&quot;Forza Bastia&quot;===
In 1978, Tati began filming &quot;Forza Bastia&quot;, a short documentary focusing on a football match between the Corsican team SC Bastia and the Dutch team PSV Eindhoven during the UEFA Cup Final, which he did not complete. Tati undertook the project at the request of his friend Gilberto Trigano, who was the president of the Bastia club at the time. His younger daughter, Sophie Tatischeff, later edited the remaining footage, which was posthumously released in 2002; Sophie died of lung cancer in 2001.

===Unmade films===
====&quot;Confusion&quot;====
Tati had plans for at least one more film. &quot;Confusion&quot;, a planned collaboration with pop duo Sparks, was a story about a futuristic Paris where activity is centered around television, communication, advertising, and modern society&#x27;s infatuation with visual imagery.

In the original script, an aging Mr. Hulot was slated to be accidentally killed on-air. Ron Mael and Russell Mael would have played two American TV studio employees brought in by a rural French TV company to help them out with some American technical expertise and input into how TV is really done. While the script still exists, &quot;Confusion&quot; was never filmed. What would have been its title track, &quot;Confusion&quot;, appears on Sparks&#x27; 1976 &quot;Big Beat&quot; album, with the internal sleeve of its 2006 re-mastered CD featuring a letter announcing the pending collaboration, as well as a photo of the Mael brothers in conversation with Tati.

====&quot;Film Tati No. 4&quot; (&quot;The Illusionist&quot;)====
Catalogued in the CNC (Centre National de la Cinématographie) archives under the title &#x27;Film Tati Nº 4&#x27;, and written in the late 1950s, the treatment was to have been the follow-up to Tati&#x27;s internationally successful &quot;Mon Oncle&quot;. It tells the bittersweet tale of a modestly talented magician – referred to only as the Illusionist – who, during a tour of decaying music halls in Eastern Europe, protectively takes an impoverished young woman under his wing.

The semi-autobiographical script that Tati wrote in 1956 was released internationally as an animated film, &quot;The Illusionist&quot;, in 2010. Directed by Sylvain Chomet, known for &quot;The Triplets of Belleville&quot;, (aka Belleville Rendezvous), the main character is an animated caricature of Tati himself.

Controversy dogged the release of Chomet&#x27;s version of &quot;The Illusionist&quot;, &quot;with The Guardian&quot; reporting:
In 2000, the screenplay was handed over to Chomet by Tati&#x27;s daughter, Sophie, two years before her death. Now, however, the family of Tati&#x27;s illegitimate and estranged eldest child, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel, who lives in the north-east of England, are calling for the French director to give her credit as the true inspiration for the film. The script of &quot;L&#x27;illusionniste&quot;, they say, was Tati&#x27;s response to the shame of having abandoned his first child [Schiel] and it remains the only public recognition of her existence. They accuse Chomet of attempting to airbrush out their painful family legacy again.

Tati&#x27;s grandson, Richard Tatischeff Schiel McDonald, wrote a long letter to film critic Roger Ebert in 2010, openly criticising the production&#x27;s interpretation of Tati&#x27;s intent for the script and explaining the family&#x27;s understanding of its origins with respect to Tati&#x27;s having abandoned his eldest child.

==Personal life, illness and death==
At the Lido de Paris, Tati met and fell in love with the young Czech-Austrian dancer Herta Schiel, who had fled Vienna with her sister Molly at the time of the Anschluss. In the summer of 1942, Herta gave birth to their daughter, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel. Tati refused to recognise the child, reportedly due to pressure from his sister, Nathalie. As a result, he was forced by Leon Volterra to depart from the Lido at the end of the 1942 season.

In 1943, after a short engagement at the ABC, where Édith Piaf was headlining, Tati, having been shunned by his former colleagues at the Lido de Paris for his behaviour, left Paris under a cloud, with his friend Henri Marquet, and they settled in the Village of Sainte-Sévère-sur-Indre. While residing there, they completed the script for &quot;L&#x27;École des facteurs&quot; (&quot;The School for Postmen&quot;), which later provided material for his first hugely successful feature, &quot;Jour de fête&quot;.

Herta Schiel remained in Paris throughout the war, where she met physician Jacques Weil, after he was called upon to treat her sister Molly for the then-incurable disease of tuberculosis. Through Weil, both sisters were recruited into the French Resistance.

In 1944, Tati returned to Paris, and after a brief courtship, married Micheline Winter.

According to Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel&#x27;s son, Richard Tatischeff Schiel McDonald, &quot;As a refugee Helga Marie-Jeanne [was] trapped in Marrakech during the Moroccan 1955 uprising for independence against its French protectorate. Having been at the centre of the Christmas Eve bombing of the main Marrakech market in which she witnessed the massacre of a number of her boarding school friends, Helga Marie-Jeanne was actively encouraged by the French Consulate to flee Morocco for her own safety. Holding only a French passport she wrote to her father in hope that he would show compassion towards her plight and help her escape the hostilities that had built up in Morocco by offering her safe passage back to her home city of Paris. He was never forthcoming with help.&quot;

On 23 October 1946, Tati&#x27;s second child, Sophie Catherine Tatischeff, was born. Tati&#x27;s son, Pierre-François Tatischeff, also known as Pierre Tati, was born in 1949. Both Pierre and Sophie worked in the French film industry in various capacities, beginning in the early 1970s. Notably, they both worked on Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s &quot;Un flic&quot; (1972).

Weakened by serious health problems, Tati died on 5 November 1982, aged 75, of a pulmonary embolism, leaving a final scenario, &quot;Confusion&quot;, which he had completed with Jacques Lagrange.

Philippe Labro reported Tati&#x27;s death in &quot;Paris Match&quot;, under the heading &quot;Adieu Monsieur Hulot. On le pleure mort, il aurait fallu l&#x27;aider vivant!&quot; (&quot;Farewell, Monsieur Hulot. We mourn him in his death, but we should have aided him while he was still alive!&quot;)

==Legacy==
===Les Films de Mon Oncle===
During the 1980s, concerned that their father&#x27;s legacy would be permanently lost, Pierre and Sophie Tatischeff tracked the rights to their father&#x27;s oeuvre to a bank in Switzerland. The bank, unable to trace the owner who had made the deposit, eventually returned the rights to Pierre and Sophie as heirs to their father&#x27;s estate.

In 1995, after a year of meticulous work, Sophie, with the aid of film technician François Ede, was able for the first time to release a colour print of &quot;Jour de fête&quot;, as Tati had originally intended.

Having lost her brother Pierre to a traffic accident, and having herself been diagnosed terminally ill, Sophie Tatischeff took the initiative to set up Les Films de Mon Oncle in 2001 to preserve, restore, and circulate her father&#x27;s work. Enlisting the services of Jérôme Deschamps, the artistic and cultural mission of Les Films de Mon Oncle is to allow audiences as well as researchers to (re-)discover the work of Tati the filmmaker, his archives, and to ensure its influence around the world.

The restoration of &quot;Playtime&quot; began in 1998, when Sophie Tatischeff made the acquaintance of Jean-Rene Failot, technical director of the Gulliver Arane, the only remaining large-format film laboratory in Europe. Because of difficulties acquiring appropriate funding, the restored version of &quot;Playtime&quot; was not presented until 2002, at the 55th Cannes Film Festival, eight months after the death of Sophie Tatischeff. In 2004, Les Films de Mon Oncle completed the restoration of &quot;My Uncle&quot;, the English version of &quot;Mon Oncle&quot;. This was followed by demanding editorial work for the DVDs of these films, including original bonuses and a double CD, &quot;Tati Sonorama!&quot;, with the complete collection of film scores and soundtrack clips.

In 2014, Les Films de Mon Oncle became part of Vivendi, in partnership with StudioCanal, which now oversees international distribution of Jacques Tati&#x27;s oeuvre, having released digitally restored versions of all his short and long films as boxsets in both DVD and Blu-ray.

===Recognition and influence===
On 3 June 1995, the rebuilt L&#x27;Idéal Cinéma in Aniche opened as the L&#x27;Idéal Cinéma Jacques Tati.

In 2009, Macha Makeïeff, the partner of Deschamps, designed and co-curated (along with Stephane Goudet) the exhibition &quot;&quot; at the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, and installed the full-scale mythical Villa Arpel, the set of &quot;Mon Oncle&quot; created by Jacques Tati and his friend Jacques Lagrange, at the 104 (Paris, 19th arrondissement).

Rowan Atkinson cited Tati as an inspiration for the physical comedy approach of his internationally renowned character Mr Bean. When asked about what influenced him, Atkinson claimed: &quot;I think it was particularly a French comedian called Jacques Tati. I loved his movies, and you know, &quot;Mr. Hulot&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, I remember seeing when I was 17—that was a major inspiration. He opened a window to a world that I&#x27;d never looked out on before, and I thought, &#x27;God, that&#x27;s interesting,&#x27; how a comic situation can be developed as purely visual and yet it&#x27;s not under-cranked, it&#x27;s not speeded-up, Benny Hill comedy—it&#x27;s more deliberate; it takes its time. And I enjoyed that&quot;.

On an interview at &quot;The 11&quot;, independent animation director Bill Plympton labeled Tati as a major influence on his work. According to Plympton, &quot;his jokes are very visual, there is not a lot of verbal interplay and talking, which I like. He&#x27;s such a great character. [His films] are surreal, they are very dry, it&#x27;s not slapstick where you trip on a rake and fall on the ground, its very subtle humor, very sensitive humor, and very ironic humor. I love the irony in his works. He&#x27;s a very good example of one of my influences.&quot;

<text>In computer science, amortized analysis is a method for analyzing a given algorithm&#x27;s complexity, or how much of a resource, especially time or memory, it takes to execute. The motivation for amortized analysis is that looking at the worst-case run time can be too pessimistic. Instead, amortized analysis averages the running times of operations in a sequence over that sequence.
As a conclusion: &quot;Amortized analysis is a useful tool that complements other techniques such as worst-case and average-case analysis.&quot;

For a given operation of an algorithm, certain situations (e.g., input parametrizations or data structure contents) may imply a significant cost in resources, whereas other situations may not be as costly. The amortized analysis considers both the costly and less costly operations together over the whole sequence of operations. This may include accounting for different types of input, length of the input, and other factors that affect its performance.

==History==
Amortized analysis initially emerged from a method called aggregate analysis, which is now subsumed by amortized analysis. The technique was first formally introduced by Robert Tarjan in his 1985 paper &quot;Amortized Computational Complexity&quot;, which addressed the need for a more useful form of analysis than the common probabilistic methods used. Amortization was initially used for very specific types of algorithms, particularly those involving binary trees and union operations. However, it is now ubiquitous and comes into play when analyzing many other algorithms as well.

==Method==

Amortized analysis requires knowledge of which series of operations are possible. This is most commonly the case with data structures, which have state that persists between operations. The basic idea is that a worst-case operation can alter the state in such a way that the worst case cannot occur again for a long time, thus &quot;amortizing&quot; its cost.

There are generally three methods for performing amortized analysis: the aggregate method, the accounting method, and the potential method. All of these give correct answers; the choice of which to use depends on which is most convenient for a particular situation.

*Aggregate analysis determines the upper bound &quot;T&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) on the total cost of a sequence of &quot;n&quot; operations, then calculates the amortized cost to be &quot;T&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) / &quot;n&quot;.
*The accounting method is a form of aggregate analysis which assigns to each operation an &quot;amortized cost&quot; which may differ from its actual cost. Early operations have an amortized cost higher than their actual cost, which accumulates a saved &quot;credit&quot; that pays for later operations having an amortized cost lower than their actual cost. Because the credit begins at zero, the actual cost of a sequence of operations equals the amortized cost minus the accumulated credit. Because the credit is required to be non-negative, the amortized cost is an upper bound on the actual cost. Usually, many short-running operations accumulate such credit in small increments, while rare long-running operations decrease it drastically.
*The potential method is a form of the accounting method where the saved credit is computed as a function (the &quot;potential&quot;) of the state of the data structure. The amortized cost is the immediate cost plus the change in potential.

==Examples==
===Dynamic array===

Consider a dynamic array that grows in size as more elements are added to it, such as in Java or in C++. If we started out with a dynamic array of size 4, we could push 4 elements onto it, and each operation would take constant time. Yet pushing a fifth element onto that array would take longer as the array would have to create a new array of double the current size (8), copy the old elements onto the new array, and then add the new element. The next three push operations would similarly take constant time, and then the subsequent addition would require another slow doubling of the array size.

In general, for an arbitrary number formula_1 of pushes to an array of any initial size, the times for steps that double the array add in a geometric series to formula_2, while the constant times for each remaining push also add to formula_2. Therefore the average time per push operation is formula_4. This reasoning can be formalized and generalized to more complicated data structures using amortized analysis.

===Queue===
Shown is a Python3 implementation of a queue, a FIFO data structure:

class Queue:
 # Initialize the queue with two empty lists
 def __init__(self):
 self.input = [] # Stores elements that are enqueued
 self.output = [] # Stores elements that are dequeued

 def enqueue(self, element):
 self.input.append(element) # Append the element to the input list

 def dequeue(self):
 if not self.output: # If the output list is empty
 # Transfer all elements from the input list to the output list, reversing the order
 while self.input: # While the input list is not empty
 self.output.append(
 self.input.pop()
 ) # Pop the last element from the input list and append it to the output list

 return self.output.pop() # Pop and return the last element from the output list
The enqueue operation just pushes an element onto the input array; this operation does not depend on the lengths of either input or output and therefore runs in constant time.

However the dequeue operation is more complicated. If the output array already has some elements in it, then dequeue runs in constant time; otherwise, dequeue takes time to add all the elements onto the output array from the input array, where &quot;n&quot; is the current length of the input array. After copying &quot;n&quot; elements from input, we can perform &quot;n&quot; dequeue operations, each taking constant time, before the output array is empty again. Thus, we can perform a sequence of &quot;n&quot; dequeue operations in only time, which implies that the amortized time of each dequeue operation is .

Alternatively, we can charge the cost of copying any item from the input array to the output array to the earlier enqueue operation for that item. This charging scheme doubles the amortized time for enqueue but reduces the amortized time for dequeue to .

<doc id="236685" wikidata="Q3624420" url="?curid=236685" title="Chub (gay slang)">
<text>A chub is an overweight or obese gay man who identifies as being part of the chubby culture. Although there is some overlap between chubs and bears, chubs have their own distinct subculture and community. There are bars, organizations and social events specifically catering to this subculture, which allows members of the community to socialize with each other and develop social networks.

In the last several years, large regional social events for gay chubs have developed. They often feature pageants in which titles are given to winners, such as &quot;Mr. Chubby International&quot; and &quot;Mr. Chaser International&quot;. In the United States, there is an annual national event, Convergence, as well as several annual regional gatherings. There is also an annual event in Europe called European Big Men&#x27;s Convergence. These events are held in different cities each year and are usually hosted by that city&#x27;s local big men&#x27;s organization. Japan has also had a large but relatively silent chub community, with &quot;Samson&quot; magazine being one of the oldest forms of Japanese media which focuses on Gay Chubs.

== Terminology ==
These definitions are general in nature; specific definitions may vary depending on the perspective of the individual.
* &quot;Chubby&quot; or &quot;chub&quot; – a large, overweight, or obese man (~300 lbs [136 kg])
* &quot;Superchub&quot; – a chub who is extremely large (400 lbs-600 lbs)
* &quot;Megachub&quot; - bigger superchub (usually drawings) (600-1000 lbs)
* &quot;Bear&quot; – a man with a stocky or heavyset build; typically hairy body and facial hair; sometimes older (or older looking) and displaying a masculine appearance and mannerisms
* &quot;Chubby bear&quot; – a bear is someone who is particularly large; this term has risen in use as the term &quot;bear&quot; has become more mainstream and broadened to include smaller men. This terminology might also include chubby gay bear, encapsulating all the fat and gay men in minor culture
* &quot;Chaser&quot; or &quot;Wolf&quot; – someone who is sexually or romantically attracted to chubs or bears, but himself has a small body type. The term &quot;chaser&quot; is sometimes used in various communities to describe an &quot;outsider&quot; who is sexually attracted to people &quot;within&quot; the community
* &quot;Chub for chub&quot; (also referenced as &quot;chub4chub&quot;, internet shorthand) – a chub who is sexually or emotionally attracted to other chubby men
* &quot;Girth &amp; Mirth&quot; – a formerly widespread name for clubs of big men and their admirers
* &quot;Big Men&#x27;s Club&quot; – another term used to define clubs and organizations for gay and bisexual men and their male admirers
* &quot;BeefyFrat&quot; – was a popular gainer/feeder social network, it folded sometime around 2014 - having been abandoned by its creator

Of note, the term &quot;chubby chaser&quot; can also be found in use among heterosexuals, most commonly referring to a man (usually thinner) who is sexually attracted to heavier, overweight, or obese women.

The chub subculture is often found to overlap with the bear subculture. Though there is no strict terminology which differentiates between the two groups, it may be noted that most Bears also associate themselves as chubs, though chubs may not necessarily associate themselves with the bear subculture.

== History ==
While casual social networks for chubby men and chasers had long existed, the first organized social group in the United States, Girth &amp; Mirth, formed in 1976 in San Francisco. The following year, a chapter was organized in Boston, and in 1978 the New York chapter started. Conventions were held in cities such as San Francisco, Chicago, and New York City as early as 1977 or 1978 with large numbers of chubbies and chasers attending. Formally organized Convergence conventions in the United States were first held in Seattle in 1986. Several chapters are now active across the United States, mostly in large and diverse cities.

<doc id="236691" wikidata="Q918363" url="?curid=236691" title="Cabaret (1972 film)">
<text>Cabaret is a 1972 American musical period drama film directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse from a screenplay by Jay Presson Allen, based on the stage musical of the same name by John Kander, Fred Ebb, and Joe Masteroff, which in turn was based on the 1951 play &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; by John Van Druten and the 1939 novel &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; by Christopher Isherwood. It stars Liza Minnelli, Michael York, Helmut Griem, Marisa Berenson, and Joel Grey. Multiple numbers from the stage score were used for the film, which also featured three other songs by Kander and Ebb, including two written for the adaptation.

In the traditional manner of musical theater, most major characters in the stage version sing to express their emotions and advance the plot; in the film, however, the musical numbers are almost entirely diegetic and take place inside the club, with the exception of &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot;, which is not performed in the club or by the club characters, but is still diegetic, a nationalistic song sung by a Nazi youth and the German crowd.

&quot;Cabaret&quot; was released in the United States on February 13, 1972, by Allied Artists. The film received critical acclaim and eventually earned more than $42 million in the box office against a production budget of $4.6 million. It won Best Picture citations from the National Board of Review and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and took Best Supporting Actor honors for Grey from the National Board of Review, the Hollywood Foreign Press, and the National Society of Film Critics. At the 45th Academy Awards, the film won Best Director (Fosse), Best Actress (Minnelli), Best Supporting Actor (Grey), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Original Song Score, Best Art Direction, and Best Sound, holding the record for most Oscars earned by a film not honored for Best Picture. In 1995, &quot;Cabaret&quot; was the twelfth live-action musical film selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==
In 1931 Berlin, a young, openly promiscuous American Sally Bowles performs at the Kit Kat Klub. A new British arrival in the city, Brian Roberts, moves into the boarding house where Sally lives. A reserved academic and writer, Brian must give English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate. Sally tries to seduce Brian, but he tells her that on three previous occasions he has tried to have sexual relationships with women, all of which failed. They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally&#x27;s bohemian life in the last days of the Weimar Republic. When Brian consoles Sally after her father cancels his meeting with her, they become lovers, concluding that his previous failures with women were because they were &quot;the wrong three girls&quot;.

Maximilian von Heune, a rich, married playboy and baron, befriends Sally and takes her and Brian to his country estate where they are both spoiled and courted. After a somewhat enigmatic experience with Brian, Max drops his pursuit of the pair in haste. During an argument, Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, and Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them 300 marks and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute earns.

Sally learns that she is pregnant but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge. At first, they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian, in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally becomes disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers. Ultimately, she has an abortion, without informing Brian in advance. When he confronts her, she shares her fears, and the two reach an understanding. Brian departs for England, and Sally continues her life in Berlin, embedding herself in the Kit Kat Klub.
Meanwhile, Fritz Wendel, a German Jew passing as a Protestant Christian, is in love with Natalia Landauer, a wealthy German Jewish heiress who holds him in contempt and suspects his motives. Through Brian, Sally advises him to be more aggressive, which eventually enables Fritz to win her love. However, to gain her parents&#x27; consent for their marriage, Fritz must reveal his Jewish background, which he does and the two are married by a rabbi.

The rise of Fascism in Europe is an ever-present undercurrent and is the over arching plot of the film. The progress of the primary characters can be tracked through their changing actions and attitudes towards the ever rising tide of German Nazism in the Weimar Republic. In the beginning of the film, a member of the Nazi Party is expelled from the Kit Kat Klub by the club manager, who suffers a subsequent beating.

The rise of the Nazis in the 1930s is also demonstrated towards the end of the film in a rural beer garden scene. There a blonde boy sings to an audience of all ages (&quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot;) about the beauties of nature and youth. It is eventually revealed that the boy is wearing a &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; uniform. The ballad then transforms into a militant Nazi anthem, and by the song&#x27;s end, one by one nearly all of the adults and young people rise and join in the singing. &quot;Do you still think you can control them?&quot; Brian then asks Max. After the beer garden scene, Brian gets into a confrontation with a Nazi on a Berlin street, which leads to his receiving a beating.

In the final scene of the film in the Kit Kat Klub, it slowly becomes apparent in the hazy club that audience members wearing NSDAP uniforms are now sitting in the preferred front seats of the club.

== Cast ==
== Historical basis ==

The 1972 film was based upon Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s semi-autobiographical stories about Weimar-era Berlin during the Jazz Age. In 1929, Isherwood moved to Berlin in order to pursue life as an openly gay man and to enjoy the city&#x27;s libertine nightlife. His expatriate social circle included W.H. Auden, Stephen Spender, Paul Bowles, and Jean Ross. While in Berlin, Isherwood shared lodgings with Ross, a British cabaret singer and aspiring film actress from a wealthy Anglo-Scottish family.

While rooming together at Nollendorfstrasse 17 in Schöneberg, Isherwood and Ross met John Blomshield, a wealthy playboy who inspired the film character of Baron Maximilian von Heune. Blomshield sexually pursued both Isherwood and Ross for a short while, and he invited them to accompany him on a trip abroad. He then abruptly disappeared without saying goodbye.

Following Blomshield&#x27;s disappearance, Ross became pregnant with the child of jazz pianist and later actor Peter van Eyck. After Eyck abandoned Ross, she underwent a near-fatal abortion facilitated by Isherwood, who pretended to have fathered her pregnancy.

While Ross recovered from the botched abortion procedure, the political situation rapidly deteriorated in Germany. As Berlin&#x27;s daily scenes featured &quot;poverty, unemployment, political demonstrations and street fighting between the forces of the extreme left and the extreme right,&quot; Isherwood, Spender, and other British nationals realized that they must flee the country. &quot;There was a sensation of doom to be felt in the Berlin streets,&quot; Spender recalled.

By the time Adolf Hitler implemented the Enabling Act of 1933 which cemented his dictatorship, Isherwood, Ross, Spender, and others had fled Germany and returned to England. Many of the Berlin cabaret denizens befriended by Isherwood would later flee abroad or perish in concentration camps. These factual events served as the genesis for Isherwood&#x27;s 1937 novella &quot;Sally Bowles,&quot; which was later adapted into the 1955 film &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; and the 1966 musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;.

== Production ==

=== Pre-production ===
In July 1968, Cinerama made a verbal agreement to make a film version of the 1966 Broadway musical but pulled out in February 1969. In May 1969, Allied Artists paid a company record $1.5 million for the film rights and planned a company record budget. The cost of $4,570,000 was split evenly with ABC Pictures.
In 1971, Bob Fosse learned through Harold Prince, director of the original Broadway production, that Cy Feuer was producing a film adaptation of &quot;Cabaret&quot; through ABC Pictures and Allied Artists. This was the first film produced in the revival of Allied Artists. Determined to direct the film, Fosse begged Feuer to hire him. However, Fosse had previously directed the unsuccessful film adaptation of &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, a box office failure which made chief executives Manny Wolf and Marty Baum reluctant to hire him. Wolf and Baum preferred a more renowned or established director such as Billy Wilder, Joseph L. Mankiewicz or Gene Kelly.

Eager to hire Fosse, Feuer appealed to the studio heads, citing Fosse&#x27;s talent for staging and shooting musical numbers, adding that if inordinate attention was given to filming the book scenes at the expense of the musical numbers, the whole film could fail. Fosse ultimately was hired. Over the next months, Fosse met with previously hired screenwriter Jay Presson Allen to discuss the screenplay.

=== Screenplay revisions ===
As production neared, Fosse became increasingly dissatisfied with Allen&#x27;s script which was based on Joe Masteroff&#x27;s original book of the stage version. Fosse hired Hugh Wheeler to rewrite and revise Allen&#x27;s work. Wheeler was referred to as a &quot;research consultant,&quot; and Allen retained screenwriting credit. Wheeler, a friend of Christopher Isherwood, knew that Isherwood had been critical of the stage musical due to its bowdlerizations of his material. Wheeler went back to Isherwood&#x27;s original stories in order to ensure a more faithful adaptation of the source material. In particular, Wheeler restored the subplot about the gigolo and the Jewish heiress. Wheeler also drew on gay author Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s openness about his homosexuality to make the leading male character a bisexual man &quot;rather than the heterosexual as he had been in the stage musical.&quot;

Fosse decided to increase the focus on the Kit Kat Klub, where Sally performs, as a metaphor for the decadence of Germany in the 1930s by eliminating all but one of the musical numbers performed outside the club. The only remaining outside number is &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot;, a folk song rendered spontaneously by patrons at an open-air café. In addition, the show&#x27;s original songwriters Kander and Ebb wrote two new songs, &quot;Mein Herr&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;, and incorporated &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;, a song they composed in 1964 and first released by Kaye Ballard.

=== Casting ===

Feuer had cast Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles and Joel Grey (reprising his stage role) long before Fosse was attached to the project. Fosse was given the choice of using Grey as Master of Ceremonies, at studio insistence, or walking away from the production. He ultimately backed down on his “It’s either me or Joel” threat, but relations between them were cool.

Fosse hired Michael York as Sally Bowles&#x27;s bisexual love interest, a casting choice which Minnelli initially believed was incorrect until she performed with him. Several smaller roles, as well as the remaining four dancers in the film, eventually were cast in West Germany.

Minnelli had auditioned to play Sally in the original Broadway production but was deemed too inexperienced at the time, even though she had won Broadway&#x27;s Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. By the time &quot;Cabaret&quot; reached the screen, however, Minnelli was a film star having earned an Oscar nomination as the emotionally damaged college student in &quot;The Sterile Cuckoo&quot; (1969).

For her performance as Sally in the film, Minnelli reinterpreted the character and—at the explicit suggestion of her father, film and stage director Vincente Minnelli—she deliberately imitated film actress Louise Brooks, a flapper icon and sex symbol of the Jazz Age. Brooks, much like the character of Sally Bowles in the film, was an aspiring actress and American expat who temporarily moved to Weimar Berlin in search of international stardom. Minnelli later recalled:

In particular, Minnelli drew upon Brooks&#x27; &quot;Lulu makeup and helmet-like coiffure.&quot; For the meeting between Sally Bowles and Brian Roberts, Minnelli modeled her movements and demeanor upon Brooks; in particular, the scene in &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1929) where Brooks&#x27; carefree character of Lulu is first introduced. Ultimately, Minnelli would win the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Sally Bowles.

=== Filming ===
Fosse and Feuer traveled to West Germany in order to finish assembling the film crew. During this time, Fosse highly recommended Robert L. Surtees for cinematographer, but Feuer and the top executives saw Surtees&#x27;s work on &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; as one of the film&#x27;s many artistic problems. Producers eventually chose British cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. Designers Rolf Zehetbauer, Hans Jürgen Kiebach and Herbert Strabel served as production designers. Charlotte Flemming designed costumes. Dancers Kathryn Doby, Louise Quick and John Sharpe were brought on as Fosse&#x27;s dance aides.

Rehearsals and filming took place entirely in West Germany. For reasons of economy, indoor scenes were shot at the Bavaria Film Studios in Grünwald, outside Munich. Prior to filming, Fosse would complain every afternoon on the set of &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; because that film was overrunning and keeping him from starting work on the same stage.

=== Narrative and news reading ===
Although the songs throughout the film allude to and advance the narrative, every song except &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot; is executed in the context of a Kit Kat Klub performance. The voice heard on the radio reading the news throughout the film in German was that of associate producer Harold Nebenzal, whose father Seymour Nebenzahl produced such notable Weimar films as &quot;M&quot; (1931), &quot;Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot; (1933), and &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; (1931).

== Film and stage difference ==
The film significantly differs from the Broadway musical. In the stage version, Sally is English (as she was in Isherwood&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot;). In the film adaptation, she is American. Cliff Bradshaw was renamed Brian Roberts and made British (as was Isherwood, upon whom the character was based), rather than American as in the stage version. The characters and plotlines involving Fritz, Natalia and Max were pulled from &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; and did not appear in the stage production of &quot;Cabaret&quot; (or in &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot;).

The most significant change involves the excision of the two main characters: Fraulein Schneider, who runs a boarding house, and her love interest, Herr Schultz, a German grocer. Their doomed romance plot, and the consequences of a Gentile falling in love with a Jew during the rise of antisemitism, was cut. With the removals were &quot;So What?&quot; and &quot;What Would You Do&quot;, sung by Schneider, the song &quot;Meeskite&quot;, sung by Schultz, and their two duets &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Please Me More (The Pineapple Song)&quot; (cut) and &quot;Married&quot; (reset as a piano instrumental, and a phonograph record), as well as a short reprise of &quot;Married&quot;, sung alone by Schultz.

Kander and Ebb wrote several new songs and removed others. &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mama&quot; was replaced by &quot;Mein Herr&quot;, and &quot;The Money Song&quot; (retained in an instrumental version as &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;) was replaced by &quot;Money, Money.&quot; &quot;Mein Herr&quot; and &quot;Money, Money&quot;, which were composed for the film, were integrated into the stage musical alongside the original numbers. The song &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;, which Sally performs at the cabaret, predates the stage musical, recorded by Minnelli in 1964. Although &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mama&quot; and &quot;Married&quot; were removed as featured musical numbers, both still appear in the film instrumentally: the bridge section of &quot;Mama&quot; is heard playing on Sally&#x27;s gramophone; &quot;Married&quot; initially plays on the piano in Fraulein Schneider&#x27;s parlor, and later heard on Sally&#x27;s gramophone in a German translation (&quot;Heiraten&quot;) sung by cabaret singer Greta Keller. Additionally, &quot;If You Could See Her&quot;, performed by the MC, originally concluded with the line &quot;She isn&#x27;t a meeskite at all&quot; onstage. The film changes this to &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t look Jewish at all,&quot; a return to Ebb&#x27;s original lyrics.

== Reception ==
===Box office===

The film opened at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on February 13, 1972, with a single performance benefit grossing $2,538. It started regular showings at the Ziegfeld from February 14, grossing $8,684 in its opening day, and a house record $80,278 for the week. It grossed another $165,038 from 6 other theatres in 6 key cities reported by &quot;Variety&quot;, placing it tenth at the US box office. After seven months of release, it had grossed $5.3 million in the New York metropolitan area. &quot;Variety&quot; estimated that this represented 30% of the film&#x27;s total compared to the normal 15% for the market, one of the few big-budget films to perform much better in New York. Based on this estimate, the film had grossed around $17 million. By year end, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that it had earned theatrical rentals of $10,885,000, making it the eighth most successful film of the year. Following the film&#x27;s success at the Academy Awards in March 1973, it reached number one at the US box office with a gross of $1,880,000 for the week, a record for Allied Artists. It remained number one for a second week. By May 1973, the film had earned rentals of $16 million in the United States and Canada and $7 million in other countries and reported a profit of $4,904,000. By the end of 1973, &quot;Variety&quot; had updated the film&#x27;s rentals in the United States and Canada to $18,175,000.

=== Critical reception ===
==== Contemporary reviews ====
&quot;Variety&quot; claimed the film received the most &quot;sugary&quot; reviews of the year. Roger Ebert gave a positive review in January 1972, saying: &quot;This is no ordinary musical. Part of its success comes because it doesn&#x27;t fall for the old cliché that musicals have to make you happy. Instead of cheapening the movie version by lightening its load of despair, director Bob Fosse has gone right to the bleak heart of the material and stayed there well enough to win an Academy Award for Best Director.&quot;

A.D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;The film version of the 1966 John Kander-Fred Ebb Broadway musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; is most unusual: it is literate, bawdy, sophisticated, sensual, cynical, heart-warming, and disturbingly thought-provoking. Liza Minnelli heads a strong cast. Bob Fosse&#x27;s generally excellent direction recreates the milieu of Germany some 40 years ago.&quot;

Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in February 1972 that &quot;&quot;Cabaret&quot; is one of those immensely gratifying imperfect works in which from beginning to end you can literally feel a movie coming to life.&quot; Likewise, Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote a review that same month in which she applauded the film: 

==== Reaction of Isherwood and others ====

Although &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972) was well received by film critics upon its release, author Christopher Isherwood and other persons upon whom the film&#x27;s characters were based were less receptive towards the cinematic adaptation. Isherwood himself was critical of the 1972 film due to what he perceived as its negative portrayal of homosexuality: 

Similarly, Isherwood&#x27;s friend Jean Ross—upon whom the character of Sally Bowles was based—was ambivalent about the film. She felt the depiction of 1930s Berlin &quot;was quite, quite different&quot; from reality. Nevertheless, she conceded that the depiction of their social circle of British expatriates as pleasure-seeking libertines was accurate: &quot;We were all utterly against the bourgeois standards of our parents&#x27; generation. That&#x27;s what took us to [Weimar-era] Berlin. The climate was freer there.&quot; Such ambivalence towards &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972) was not unique among Isherwood&#x27;s circle.

The poet Stephen Spender lamented how &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972) glossed over Weimar Berlin&#x27;s crushing poverty:
 Both Spender and Ross contended that the 1972 film and 1966 Broadway musical deleteriously glamorized the harsh realities of the 1930s Weimar era.

==== Retrospective reviews ====
In 2002, Jamie Russell of the BBC wrote that the film was &quot;the first musical ever to be given an X certificate, Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret&quot; launched Liza Minnelli into Hollywood superstardom and re-invented the musical for the Age of Aquarius.&quot; In 2013, film critic Peter Bradshaw listed &quot;Cabaret&quot; at number one on his list of &quot;Top 10 Musicals&quot;, describing it as &quot;satanically catchy, terrifyingly seductive...directed and choreographed with electric style by Bob Fosse...&quot;Cabaret&quot; is drenched in the sexiest kind of cynicism and decadent despair.&quot; In 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Cabaret as the best movie musical of all time 

==== Controversies ====
Although less explicit compared with other films made in the 1970s, &quot;Cabaret&quot; dealt explicitly with topics like corruption, sexual ambiguity, false dreams, and Nazism. Tim Dirks at Filmsite.org notes: &quot;The sexually-charged, semi-controversial, kinky musical was the first one ever to be given an X rating (although later re-rated) with its numerous sexual flings and hedonistic club life. There was considerable sexual innuendo, profanity, casual sex talk (homosexual and heterosexual), some evidence of anti-Semitism, and even an abortion in the film.&quot; It was also rated X in the UK and later re-rated as 15.

On the topic of Nazism, there was little consensus among critics about the possibly fascist implications of the film and play. However, critic Steven Belletto wrote a critique of &quot;Cabaret&quot; in the &quot;Criticism&quot; journal, published by Wayne State University Press, in which he highlighted the anti-fascist themes in the film present both within and outside of the musical acts. According to Belletto, &quot;despite the ways that the film has been understood by a variety of critics, [&quot;Cabaret&quot;] rejects the logic of fascist certainty by staging various numbers committed to irony and ambiguity.&quot;

The &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot; scene was controversial, with Kander and Ebb, both of whom were Jewish, sometimes being wrongly accused of using a historical Nazi song. According to an article in &quot;Variety&quot; in November 1976, the film was censored in West Berlin when it was first released there theatrically, with the sequence featuring the Hitler Youth singing &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot; having been deleted. This elimination was made &quot;because of the feeling that it might stir up resentments in the audience by showing the sympathizers for the Nazi movement during the &#x27;30s.&quot; The sequence was restored, however, when the film was shown on West German television on November 7, 1976.

Another topic of discussion was the song &quot;If You Could See Her&quot;, which closed with the line: &quot;If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn&#x27;t look Jewish at all.&quot; The point of the song was showing anti-Semitism as it begins to run rampant in Berlin, but there were a number of Jewish groups who interpreted the lyrics differently.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Cabaret&quot; earned a total of ten Academy Award nominations (winning eight of them) and holds the record for most Academy Awards for a film that did not also win Best Picture.

Shortly before the Academy Awards, Bob Fosse won two Tony Awards for directing and choreographing &quot;Pippin&quot;, his biggest stage hit. Months later, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for choreographing and directing Liza Minnelli&#x27;s television special &quot;Liza with a Z&quot;, thereby becoming the first director to win all three awards in one year.

=== American Film Institute recognition ===
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs

* AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – No. 5
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – No. 63 

=== National Film Registry ===
Inducted into the National Film Registry in 1995 among a list of 25 Films that year.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Cabaret&quot; has been cited by &quot;TV Guide&quot; as among the greatest films made and in &quot;Movieline&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;100 Best Movies Ever&quot;. It was included in Film4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Films of All Time&quot; at #78 and in &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s &quot;Hot 100 Films of the Past&quot;, being hailed as &quot;the last great musical. Liza Minnelli plays Sally Bowles, an American adrift in pre-Nazi Berlin, in Bob Fosse&#x27;s stylish, near-perfect film.&quot;

David Benedict has written in &quot;The Guardian&quot; about &quot;Cabaret&quot; influence in musical films: &quot;Back then, musicals were already low on film-goers&#x27; lists, so how come it was such a success? Simple: &quot;Cabaret&quot; is the musical for people who hate them. Given the vibrancy of its now iconic numbers – Liza Minnelli in bowler and black suspenders astride a bentwood chair belting out &#x27;Mein Herr&#x27; or shimmying and shivering with pleasure over &#x27;Money&#x27; with Joel Grey – it sounds strange to say it, but one of the chief reasons why &quot;Cabaret&quot; is so popular is that it&#x27;s not shot like a musical.&quot;

The film has been listed as one of the most important for queer cinema for its depictions of bisexuality, arguably transgressive at the time of its 1972 post-Code release and has been credited with turning Liza Minnelli into a gay icon. Film blogs have selected it as &quot;the gayest winner in the history of the Academy.&quot;

=== Home media ===
The film was first released to DVD in 1998. There have been releases in 2003, 2008, and 2012. The film&#x27;s international ancillary distribution rights are owned by ABC (now part of The Walt Disney Company), Fremantle (UK), Warner Bros. (which acquired the film as part of its purchase of Lorimar Productions, which had acquired the film library of Allied Artists) has US domestic distribution rights.

In April 2012, Warner unveiled a new restoration of the film at the TCM Classic Film Festival. A DigiBook edition was later released on Blu-ray on February 5, 2013. Before this restoration, &quot;Cabaret&quot; had been sold on a standard-definition DVD from Warner Bros., but the film was unavailable in high-definition or for digital projections in cinemas. The original camera negative is lost, and a surviving interpositive had a vertical scratch that ran through 1,000 feet, or 10 minutes, of one of its reels, as confirmed by Ned Price, vice president of mastering and restoration for Warner Bros. The damage ostensibly was inflicted by a grain of dirt that had rolled through the length of the reel, beginning with a scene in which Michael York&#x27;s character confronts a pro-Nazi boarding house resident, and had cut into the emulsion. The marred frames were digitally restored, but &quot;the difficult part was matching the grain structure so the fix was invisible.&quot; After automated digital repair attempts failed, the 1,000 feet of damaged film was hand painted using a computer stylus.

Warner Archive Collection reissued the Blu-ray on November 20, 2018, without the DigiBook.

== Uses ==
Many root vegetables keep well in root cellars, lasting several months. This is one way of storing food for use long after harvest, which is especially important in nontropical latitudes, where winter is traditionally a time of little to no harvesting. There are also season extension methods that can extend the harvest throughout the winter, mostly through the use of polytunnels.

Starchy root vegetables are of particular economic importance as staple foods, especially in tropical regions. They overshadow cereals throughout much of Central and West Africa, as well as Oceania, in these areas being used directly or mashed to make foods such as fufu or poi.

<text>Postdigital, in artistic practice, is a term that describes works of art and theory that are more concerned with being human than with being digital, similar to the concept of &quot;undigital&quot; introduced in 1995, where technology and society advances beyond digital limitations to achieve a totally fluid multimediated reality that is free from artefacts of digital computation (quantization noise, pixelation, etc.). The postdigital is concerned with our rapidly changed and changing relationships with digital technologies and art forms.

== Theory ==
According to Giorgio Agamben (2002), the postdigital is a paradigm that (as with post-humanism) does not aim to describe a life &quot;after&quot; digital, but rather, attempts to describe the present-day opportunity to explore the consequences of the digital and of the computer age. While the computer age has enhanced human capacity with inviting and uncanny prosthetics, the postdigital provides a paradigm with which it is possible to examine and understand this enhancement.

In &quot;The Future of Art in a Postdigital Age,&quot; Mel Alexenberg defines &quot;postdigital art&quot; as artworks that address the humanization of digital technologies through interplay between digital, biological, cultural, and spiritual systems, between cyberspace and real space, between embodied media and mixed reality in social and physical communication, between high tech and high touch experiences, between visual, haptic, auditory, and kinesthetic media experiences, between virtual and augmented reality, between roots and globalization, between autoethnography and community narrative, and between web-enabled peer-produced wikiart and artworks created with alternative media through participation, interaction, and collaboration in which the role of the artist is redefined, and between tactile art and NFTs. 
Mel Alexenberg proposes that a postdigital age is defined in &quot;Wired&quot; by MIT Media Center director Nicholas Negroponte: &quot;Like air and drinking water, being digital will be noticed only in its absence, not by its presence. Face it - the Digital Revolution is over&quot;

== Music ==
Kim Cascone uses the term in his article &quot;The Aesthetics of Failure: &quot;Post-digital&quot; Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music.&quot; He begins the article with a quotation from MIT Media Lab cyberpundit Nicholas Negroponte: &quot;The digital revolution is over.&quot; Cascone goes on to describe what he sees as a &#x27;post-digital&#x27; line of flight in the music also commonly known as glitch or microsound music, observing that &#x27;with electronic commerce now a natural part of the business fabric of the Western world and Hollywood cranking out digital fluff by the gigabyte, the medium of digital technology holds less fascination for composers in and of itself.&#x27; Japanese theorist, Ryota Matsumoto adapts the postdigital discourse of Kim Cascone to their ingenious culture and construes Japanese social structure as the postdigital after the collapse of capitalist accumulation and the subsequent integration of their tradition with the pharmacology of digital age.

In &quot;Art after Technology,&quot; Maurice Benayoun lists possible tracks for &quot;postdigital&quot; art considering that the digital flooding has altered the entire social, economical, artistic landscape, and the artist posture will move in ways that try to escape the technological realm without being able to completely discard it. From lowtech to biotech and &quot;critical fusion&quot; - critical intrusion of fiction inside reality – new forms of art emerge from the digital era.

<text>Ronald Lawrence Kovic (born July 4, 1946) is an American anti-war activist, author, and United States Marine Corps sergeant who was wounded and paralyzed in the Vietnam War. His best selling 1976 memoir &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; was made into the film of the same name which starred actor Tom Cruise as Kovic, and was co-written by Kovic and directed by Oliver Stone.

Kovic received the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay on January 20, 1990, 22 years to the day that he was wounded in Vietnam, and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category.

==Early life==
Kovic was born in Ladysmith, Wisconsin, the second of six children of Patricia Ann Lamb (January 6, 1923 – June 30, 2006) and Eli Thomas Kovic (August 3, 1920 – May 1, 1999). Eli Thomas Kovic met Lamb while serving in the Navy during the Second World War after both enlisted shortly after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Eli was of Croatian ancestry. Patricia was of Irish ancestry. She was a housewife. Kovic grew up in Massapequa, New York, and graduated in 1964 from Massapequa High School on Long Island.

==Military service in Vietnam==
Kovic volunteered to serve in the Vietnam War, and was sent to South Vietnam in December 1965 as a member of H&amp;S Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. In June 1966, he was transferred to Bravo Company, Second Platoon, 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division where he participated in 22 long range reconnaissance patrols in enemy territory and was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V for valor. After a 13-month tour of duty, he returned home on January 15, 1967. He was subsequently assigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing at Cherry Point, North Carolina. Several months later, he volunteered to return to Vietnam for a second tour of duty.

On January 20, 1968, while leading a reconnaissance force of battalion scouts from the 1st Amtrac Battalion just north of the Cửa Việt River in the vicinity of the village of Mỹ Lộc, in the Demilitarized Zone, Kovic&#x27;s squad came into contact with the NVA 803rd Regiment and elements of a Viet Cong battalion that was besieging the village; he was shot by NVA soldiers while leading his rifle squad across an open area, attempting to aid the South Vietnamese Popular Force unit in the village. Deserted by most of his unit, he was shot first in the right foot, which tore out the back of his heel, then again through the right shoulder, suffering a collapsed lung and a spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down. The first Marine that tried to save him was shot through the heart and killed, before a second Marine carried Kovic to safety through heavy enemy fire. Kovic spent a week in an intensive care ward in Da Nang. As a result of his service and injuries in the conflict, Kovic was awarded the Bronze Star with Combat &quot;V&quot; for heroism in battle and the Purple Heart.

==Post-Vietnam activism==

Before the end of the war in Vietnam was declared on April 30, 1975, Kovic became one of the best-known peace activists among the Vietnam veterans, and was arrested 12 times for political protesting. He attended his first peace demonstration soon after the Kent State shootings in May 1970, and gave his first speech against the war at Levittown Memorial High School in Levittown, Long Island, New York that same spring. Kovic&#x27;s speech that day was interrupted by a bomb threat and the auditorium was cleared.

Undeterred, Kovic continued speaking to students from the school&#x27;s football grandstands. His first arrest was during an anti-Vietnam War demonstration at an Orange County, California draft board in the spring of 1971. He refused to leave the office of the draft board, explaining to a representative that, by sending young men to Vietnam, they were inadvertently &quot;condemning them to their death&quot;, or to be wounded and maimed like himself in a war that he had come to believe was &quot;immoral and made no sense&quot;. He was told that, if he did not leave the draft board immediately, he would be arrested. Kovic refused to leave and was taken away by police.

In 1974, Kovic led a group of disabled Vietnam War veterans in wheelchairs on a 17-day hunger strike inside the Los Angeles office of Senator Alan Cranston. The veterans protested the &quot;poor treatment in America&#x27;s veterans&#x27; hospitals and demanded better treatment for returning veterans, a full investigation of all Veterans Administration (VA) facilities, and a face-to-face meeting with the head of the VA, Donald E. Johnson. The strike continued to escalate until Johnson finally agreed to fly out from Washington, D.C., and meet with the veterans. The hunger strike ended soon after that. Several months later, Johnson resigned. In late August 1974, Kovic traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he spent a week in the Catholic stronghold of &quot;Turf Lodge&quot;, interviewing both political activists and residents. In the spring of 1975, Kovic, author Richard Boyle, and photo journalist Loretta Smith traveled to cover the Cambodian Civil War for Pacific News Service.

On the night of July 15, 1976, at the Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Kovic spoke from the podium seconding the nomination of draft resister Fritz Efaw for Vice President of the United States.

In 1990, Kovic considered running for a seat in the House of Representatives against California Republican Bob Dornan. Kovic ultimately decided not to run.

From 1990 to 1991, Kovic took part in several anti-war demonstrations against the first Gulf War, which occurred not long after the release of his biographical film in 1989. In early May 1999, following the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, Kovic met with China&#x27;s ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing at the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. to express his condolences and present the ambassador and his staff with two dozen red roses. He was an outspoken critic of the Iraq War.

===Since 2000===
In November 2003, Kovic joined protests in London against the visit of George W. Bush. He was the guest of honor at a reception held at London&#x27;s city hall by Mayor Ken Livingstone. The following day, he led a march of several hundred thousand demonstrators on Trafalgar Square, where a huge rally was held to protest the visit of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Kovic attended the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. On Sunday, August 24, 2008, the day before the convention began, Kovic spoke, then led thousands in a march against the war which ended with him saying, &quot;In the city of Denver, we got welcomed home.&quot;

In a new introduction to his book, &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1976), written in March 2005, Kovic stated, &quot;I wanted people to understand. I wanted to share with them as nakedly and openly and intimately as possible what I had gone through, what I had endured. I wanted them to know what it really meant to be in a war, to be shot and wounded, to be fighting for my life on the intensive care ward, not the myth we had grown up believing. I wanted people to know about the hospitals and the enema room, about why I had become opposed to the war, why I had grown more and more committed to peace and nonviolence. I had been beaten by the police and arrested twelve times for protesting the war and I had spent many nights in jail in my wheelchair. I had been called a Communist and a traitor, simply for trying to tell the truth about what had happened in that war, but I refused to be intimidated.&quot; In 1989, on the last day of filming &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, Kovic presented actor Tom Cruise, who portrayed him in the movie, the original Bronze Star he had received, explaining to Cruise that he was giving him the medal as a gift &quot;for his heroic performance&quot;.

Kovic lives in Redondo Beach, California, where he writes, paints, plays the piano, and gardens. He had a close relationship with Connie Panzarino, author of &quot;The Me in the Mirror&quot;.

==Legacy==
Bruce Springsteen wrote the song &quot;Shut Out the Light&quot; after reading Kovic&#x27;s memoir and then meeting him.

Military Awards: Bronze Star with Combat V, Purple Heart, Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V, Vietnam Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, Good Conduct Medal.

==Personal life==
Kovic is the uncle of internet personality Adam Kovic.

==Films==

*1989 – &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; - (co-screenwriter with Oliver Stone). Directed by Oliver Stone. Kovic also has a brief cameo appearance in the film as a wheelchair-using soldier in the opening parade scene, who flinches as firecrackers explode, something Tom Cruise&#x27;s Kovic will also do later in the film.

<text>Albert Spaggiari (14 December 1932 – 8 June 1989), nicknamed Bert, was a French criminal chiefly known as the organizer of a break-in into a Société Générale bank in Nice, France, in July 1976 that resulted in the theft of an estimated 46 million francs, none of which were ever found.

==Early life==
Albert Spaggiari was born on 14 December 1932 in Laragne-Montéglin in the Hautes-Alpes to Richard and Marcelle (née Clément) Spaggiari. His father died in 1935 and he grew up in Hyères, where his mother ran a lingerie store.

At the age of 19, he enlisted as a paratrooper in the First Indochina War, and was posted to the 3rd Battalion colonial paratroopers. During this time, he and a few accomplices put a gun to the head of someone that they claimed had robbed them. The military court, however, believed that this was actually a stickup, and Spaggiari spent the next four years in jail.

Following his release, he moved to North Africa and joined the Organisation armée secrète (OAS), a right-wing group that wanted to prevent Algerian independence. This later led him to be sentenced to three and a half more years in jail, on the charges of political terrorism. 

Spaggiari, seemingly having had put politics behind him, then moved to Nice, France, alongside his wife, Audi. They lived in a country villa, called The Wild Geese, where they raised chickens. He also worked as a photographer.

== Work with the DINA ==
Albert Spaggiari and the Corsican Brotherhood (CB) were recruited in France by the Chilean secret police, Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional; Spaggiari had a good relationship with Augusto Pinochet. His codename was &quot;Daniel&quot;. This group was called the DINA &quot;Brigada Corsa&quot; (&quot;Corsican Brigade&quot;).

According to a CIA document declassified in 2000 and published by the National Security Archive, Michael Townley, the DINA international agent responsible for the Assassination of Orlando Letelier, a member of Salvador Allende&#x27;s government, in Washington, DC, 1976, was in contact with Spaggiari. Information contained in the document suggests that Spaggiari conducted operations on behalf of DINA.

==Bank robbery in Nice==
After Spaggiari heard that the sewers were close to the vault of the Société Générale bank in Nice, he recruited accomplices through the OAS to access the vault from the sewer system and remove its proceeds. The heist involved at least 20 people, 6 of whom were later arrested, and 30 tanks of acetylene. The men accessed the sewers and spent two months digging an tunnel from the sewer to the vault floor. They used rubber rafts and installed hundreds of metres of electrical cables for lighting. They set up picnic tables for meals and air mattresses for sleeping.

On 16 July 1976, during the long weekend of Bastille Day, when most locals were on vacation, Spaggiari&#x27;s gang broke into the vault. They stole an estimated 46 million francs worth of money, securities and valuables. It was the largest heist in the history of bank robberies to that date.

They spent hours picking through the various safe deposit boxes. Before they left on 20 July they left a message on the walls of the vault: &quot;sans armes, ni haine, ni violence&quot; (&quot;without weapons, neither hatred, nor violence&quot;).

===Claim of responsibility by Cassandri===
In 2010, Jacques Cassandri published a book, &quot;The Truth about the Nice Heist&quot;, in which he claimed responsibility for the 1976 robbery and that Albert Spaggiari only played a small part. He could not be prosecuted for the crime under French law as the statute of limitations had expired. However, he was arrested on suspicion of later money laundering, using proceeds of the robbery to fund business ventures in Marseilles and Corsica. About twenty people were held for questioning in connection with the case, including Cassandri&#x27;s wife and children and a Corsican politician. Cassandri said that he made the equivalent of €2 million from the robbery and quickly spent it, although prosecutors noted that he continued to lead a lavish life from the proceeds. Cassandri claimed at trial that the book was a work of fiction and was ultimately acquitted on the most serious charges of organized crime and money laundering, but was convicted of other charges relating to his business practices including fraud and influence peddling and jailed for 30 months.

==Capture and escape==
At first the French police were baffled. However, at the end of October, on a tip from a former girlfriend, they arrested one of the thieves. After a lengthy interrogation he implicated the entire gang, including Spaggiari. When Spaggiari, who had been accompanying the mayor of Nice Jacques Médecin in the Far East as a photographer, returned to Nice, he was arrested at the airport.

Spaggiari chose Jacques Peyrat, a veteran of the French Foreign Legion who belonged at the time to the National Front, as his defence attorney. Spaggiari first denied his involvement in the break-in, then acknowledged it but claimed that he was working to fund a secret political organization named Catena (Italian for &quot;chain&quot;) that seems to have existed only in his fantasy.

During his case hearings, Spaggiari made a coded fictitious document which he claimed as evidence. While judge Richard Bouaziz was distracted by the document, Spaggiari jumped out of a window, landing safely on a parked car and escaped on a waiting motorcycle. Some reports said that the owner of the car later received a 5,000-franc cheque in the mail for the damage to his roof.

In 1995, Jacques Peyrat accused Christian Estrosi, French minister and former motorcycle champion, of having been Spaggiari&#x27;s driver, but Estrosi proved that he had been racing in Daytona Beach, Florida, at the time.

==Life in hiding==
Spaggiari remained free for the rest of his life. He was sentenced via a &quot;trial in absentia&quot; to life imprisonment. He is reported to have had plastic surgery to change his appearance, and to have spent probably most of the rest of his life in Argentina, visiting France clandestinely to see his mother or his wife &quot;Audi&quot;.

While publishing his last book &quot;Le journal d&#x27;une truffe&quot; a 15-minute interview with him by Bernard Pivot was recorded, reportedly in Milan, Italy, for the TV program &quot;Apostrophes&quot;.

==Death==
Spaggiari, a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer at age 56. His body was found by his mother in front of his home in Hyères on 10 June 1989. He had no children.

==Works==
*&quot;Faut pas rire avec les barbares&quot; (1977)
*&quot;Les égouts du paradis&quot; (1978)
*&quot;Le journal d&#x27;une truffe&quot; (1983)
Translated into English by Martin Sokolinsky and published as &quot;Fric-Frac: The Great Riviera Bank Robbery&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Sewers of Gold&quot; (1981).

==Popular culture==

French authors René Louis Maurice and Jean-Claude Simoën wrote the book &quot;Cinq Milliards au bout de l&#x27;égout&quot; (1977) about Spaggiari&#x27;s bank heist in Nice. Their work was translated to English in 1978 by British author Ken Follett under the title &quot;The Heist of the Century&quot;; it was also published as &quot;The Gentleman of 16 July&quot; and &quot;Under the Streets of Nice&quot;.

Three films were produced which were also based on the Nice bank robbery:
* &quot;Les égouts du paradis,&quot; a 1979 French film directed by José Giovanni.
* &quot;The Great Riviera Bank Robbery,&quot; also known &quot;Dirty Money&quot; and &quot;Sewers of Gold,&quot; a 1979 British film directed by Francis Megahy.
* &quot;Sans arme, ni haine, ni violence,&quot; a 2008 French film directed by Jean-Paul Rouve.

The Canadian television series &quot;Masterminds&quot; produced and aired an episode titled &quot;The Riviera Job,&quot; reenacting the story of the robbery.

A Czech film, &quot;Prachy dělaj člověka,&quot; contains a reference to the heist, suggesting that one of the characters participated in it.

In 2016, Italian author Carlos D&#x27;Ercole published a book about the heist titled &quot;Le Fogne del paradiso&quot;.

<text>[[Chronology|Timeline]] of [[paleontology]]

==Antiquity – 16th century== 
* 6th century B.C. — The pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon argues that fossils of marine organisms show that dry land was once under water. 
* 4th century B.C. — Aristotle posits that the stoniness of fossils is caused by vaporous exhalations.
* 1027 — The Persian naturalist Avicenna elaborates on Aristotle&#x27;s speculations in &quot;The Book of Healing&quot; by proposing that fossils are caused by petrifying fluids (&quot;succus lapidificatus&quot;).
* 1031-1095 — The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo uses evidence of marine fossils found in the Taihang Mountains to infer geological processes caused shifting of seashores over time, and uses petrified bamboos found underground in Yan&#x27;an, to argue for gradual climate change.
* 1320-1390 — Avicenna&#x27;s theory of petrifying fluids is elaborated on by Albert of Saxony.
*c. 1500 — Leonardo da Vinci uses ichnofossils to complement his hypothesis concerning the biogenic nature of body fossils.

==17th century==
* 1665 — In his book &quot;Micrographia&quot; Robert Hooke compares petrified wood to wood, concludes that petrified wood formed from wood soaked in mineral-rich water, and argues that fossils like &quot;Ammonite&quot; shells were produced the same way, sparking debate over the organic origin of fossils and the possibility of extinction. 
* 1669 — Nicolas Steno writes that some kinds of rock formed from layers of sediment deposited in water, and that fossils were organic remains buried in the process.
* 1699 - Edward Lhuyd names the new sauropod genus and species &quot;&quot;Ruttelum implicatum&quot;. By doing so, he names the first prehistoric creature that is recognizable as a dinosaur.

==18th century==
* 1770 — The fossilized bones of a huge animal are found in a quarry near Maastricht in the Netherlands. In 1808 Georges Cuvier identified it as an extinct marine reptile and in 1822 William Conybeare names it &quot;Mosasaurus&quot;.
* 1789 — The skeleton of a large animal is unearthed in Argentina. In 1796 Cuvier reports that it had an affinity to modern tree sloths and names it &quot;Megatherium&quot;. 
* 1796 — Cuvier presents a paper on living and fossil elephants that shows that mammoths were a different species from any living elephant. He argues that this proved the reality of extinction, which he attributes to a geological catastrophe.
* 1800 — Cuvier writes that a drawing of a fossil found in Bavaria shows a flying reptile; in 1809 he names it &quot;Pterodactyl&quot;.

==19th century== 
* 1804 — Cuvier writes about fossils of extinct mammals from the Paris Basin, arguing that they are similar to other mammals such as ruminants but also differ by dental and postcranial morphologies. He named two genera &quot;Palaeotherium&quot; and &quot;Anoplotherium&quot;.
* 1808 — Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart publish preliminary results of their survey of the geology of the Paris Basin that uses the fossils found in different strata to reconstruct the geologic history of the region. 
* 1811 — Mary Anning and her brother Joseph discover the fossilized remains of an &quot;Ichthyosaur&quot; at Lyme Regis.
* 1812 - Cuvier draws skeletal reconstructions of &quot;Palaeotherium&quot; &quot;minor&quot; (= &quot;Plagiolophus minor&quot;), &quot;Anoplotherium medium&quot;&quot; (= &quot;Xiphodon gracilis&quot;), and, most famously, &quot;Anoplotherium commune&quot; based on known fossil remains (of which &quot;A. commune&quot; was the most nearly complete) and publishes them in his 1812 summary of fossil mammals from Paris. He also drew speculative reconstructions of the muscles of &quot;A. commune&quot; to showcase its robustness but did not publish them out of concern of negative perceptions on speculations.
* 1815 — William Smith published &quot;The Map that Changed the World&quot;, the first geologic map of England, Wales, and southern Scotland, using fossils to correlate rock strata.
* 1821 — William Buckland analyzes Kirkdale Cave in Yorkshire, containing the bones of lions, elephants and rhinoceros, and concludes it was a prehistoric hyena den.
* 1821-1822 — Mary Anning discovers the world&#x27;s first &quot;Plesiosaur&quot; skeleton at Lyme Regis.
* 1822 — Mary Ann Mantell and Gideon Mantell discover fossil teeth of the dinosaur &quot;Iguanodon&quot;.
* 1822 — The editor of the French journal &quot;Journal de Phisique&quot;, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, invents the word &quot;paleontologie&quot; for the reconstruction of ancient animals and plants from fossils.
* 1823 — Buckland finds a human skeleton with mammoth remains at Paviland Cave on the Gower Peninsula, but at the time it is not accepted that this showed they coexisted.
* 1824 — Buckland finds lower jaw of the carnivorous dinosaur &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. 
* 1829 — Buckland publishes paper on work he and Mary Anning had done identifying and analyzing fossilized feces found at Lyme Regis and elsewhere. Buckland coins the term &quot;coprolite&quot; for them, and uses them to analyze ancient food chains.
* 1830 — The Cuvier–Geoffroy debate in Paris on the determination of animal structure
* 1831 — Mantell publishes an influential paper entitled &quot;The Age of Reptiles&quot; summarizing evidence of an extended period during which large reptiles had been the dominant animals. 
* 1832 — Mantell finds partial skeleton of the dinosaur &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot;.
* 1836 — Edward Hitchcock describes footprints (Eubrontes and Otozoum) of giant birds from Jurassic formations in Connecticut. Later they would be recognized as dinosaur tracks.
* 1841 — Anatomist Richard Owen creates a new order of reptiles, &quot;dinosauria&quot;, for animals: &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot;, found by Mantell and Buckland.
* 1841 — The first global geologic timescale is defined by John Phillips based on the type of fossils found in different rock layers. He coins the term &quot;Mesozoic&quot; for what Mantell had called &quot;The Age of Reptiles.&quot; 
* 1856 — Fossils are found in the Neander Valley in Germany that Johann Carl Fuhlrott and Hermann Schaaffhausen recognize as a human different from modern people. A few years later William King names &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;. 
* 1858 — The first dinosaur skeleton found in the United States, &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;, is excavated and described by Joseph Leidy.
* 1859 — Charles Darwin publishes &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.
* 1861 — The first &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, skeleton is found in Bavaria, Germany, and recognized as a transitional form between reptiles and birds.

<text>Jayson Thomas Blair (born March 23, 1976) is an American former journalist who worked for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In May 2003, he resigned from the newspaper following the revelation of fabrication and plagiarism within his articles. 

In 2004, he published a memoir entitled &quot;Burning Down My Masters&#x27; House&quot; reflecting on his career, discussing his diagnosis of bipolar disorder after his resignation from the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and offering his perspective on race relations at the newspaper; he subsequently established a bipolar disorder support group and pursued a life-coaching career.

==Background==
Blair was born in Columbia, Maryland, the son of a federal executive and a schoolteacher. While attending the University of Maryland, College Park, he was a student journalist. For the 1996–1997 academic year, he was selected as the second African-American editor-in-chief of its student newspaper, &quot;The Diamondback&quot;. According to a 2004 article by the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;, &quot;some of his fellow students opposed his selection, describing him as &#x27;an elbows-out competitor.&#x27;&quot;

After a summer interning at &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1998, Blair was offered an extended internship there. He declined in order to complete more coursework for graduation, but returned to the &quot;Times&quot; in June 1999 with a year of coursework left to complete. That November, he was classified as an &quot;intermediate reporter&quot;. He was later promoted to a full reporter and then to editor.

==Plagiarism and fabrication scandal==
On April 28, 2003, Blair received a call from &quot;Times&quot; national editor James Roberts asking him about similarities between a story he had written two days earlier and one published April 18 by &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; reporter Macarena Hernandez. The senior editor of the &quot;Express-News&quot; had contacted the &quot;Times&quot; about the similarities between Blair&#x27;s article in the &quot;Times&quot; and Hernandez&#x27;s article in his paper.

The resulting inquiry led to the discovery of fabrication and plagiarism in a number of articles written by Blair. Some fabrications include Blair&#x27;s claims to have traveled to the city mentioned in the dateline, when in fact he did not.

Questionable articles included the following:
*In the October 30, 2002, piece &quot;US Sniper Case Seen as a Barrier to a Confession&quot;, Blair wrote that a dispute between police authorities had ruined the interrogation of Beltway sniper suspect John Muhammad and that Muhammad was about to confess, quoting unnamed officials. This was swiftly denied by everyone involved. Blair also named certain lawyers who were not present as having witnessed the interrogation.
*In the February 10, 2003, piece &quot;Peace and Answers Eluding Victims of the Sniper Attacks&quot;, Blair claimed to be in Washington. He allegedly plagiarized quotations from a &quot;Washington Post&quot; story and fabricated quotations from a person he had never interviewed. Blair ascribed a wide range of attributes to a man featured in the article, almost all of which the man in question denied. Blair also published information that he had promised was off the record.
*In the March 3, 2003, piece &quot;Making Sniper Suspect Talk Puts Detective in Spotlight&quot;, Blair claimed to be in Fairfax, Virginia. He described a videotape of Lee Malvo, the younger defendant in the case, being questioned by police and quoted officials&#x27; review of the tape. No such tape existed. Blair also claimed a detective noticed blood on a man&#x27;s jeans, leading to a confession (which had not occurred).
*In the March 27, 2003, piece &quot;Relatives of Missing Soldiers Dread Hearing Worse News&quot;, Blair claimed to be in West Virginia. He allegedly plagiarized quotations from an Associated Press article. He claimed to have spoken to the father of Jessica Lynch, who had no recollection of meeting Blair; said &quot;tobacco fields and cattle pastures&quot; were visible from Lynch&#x27;s parents&#x27; house when they were not; erroneously stated that Lynch&#x27;s brother was in the National Guard; misspelled Lynch&#x27;s mother&#x27;s name; and fabricated a dream that he claimed she had had.
*In the April 3, 2003, piece &quot;Rescue in Iraq and a &#x27;Big Stir&#x27; in West Virginia&quot;, Blair claimed to have covered the Lynch story from her hometown of Palestine, West Virginia. Blair never traveled to Palestine, and his entire contribution to the story consisted of rearranged details from Associated Press stories.
*In the April 7, 2003, piece &quot;For One Pastor, the War Hits Home&quot;, Blair wrote of a church service in Cleveland and an interview with the minister. Blair never went to Cleveland; he spoke to the minister by telephone, and copied portions of the article from an earlier &quot;Washington Post&quot; article. He also plagiarized quotations from &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; and &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. He fabricated a detail about the minister keeping a picture of his son inside his Bible and got the name of the church wrong.
*In the April 19, 2003, piece &quot;In Military Wards, Questions and Fears from the Wounded&quot;, Blair described interviewing four injured soldiers in a naval hospital. He had never gone to the hospital and had spoken to only one soldier by telephone, to whom he later attributed made-up quotes. Blair wrote that the soldier &quot;will most likely limp the rest of his life and need to use a cane&quot;, which was untrue. He said another soldier had lost his right leg when it had been amputated below the knee. He described two soldiers as being in the hospital at the same time, but they were admitted five days apart.

After internal investigations, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on Blair&#x27;s journalistic misdeeds in an &quot;unprecedented&quot; 7,239-word front-page story on May 11, 2003, headlined &quot;Times Reporter Who Resigned Leaves Long Trail of Deception&quot;. The story called the affair &quot;a low point in the 152-year history of the newspaper.&quot;

After the scandal broke, some 30 former staffers of &quot;The Diamondback&quot;, who had worked with Blair when he was editor-in-chief at the university newspaper, signed a 2003 letter alleging that Blair had made four serious errors as a reporter and editor while at the University of Maryland. They said these and his work habits brought his integrity into question. The letter-signers alleged that questions raised by some of these staffers at the time were ignored by Maryland Media, Inc., the board that owned the paper.

==Aftermath==
The investigation, known as the Siegal committee, found heated debate among the staff over affirmative action hiring, as Blair is black. Jonathan Landman, Blair&#x27;s editor, told the Siegal committee he felt that Blair&#x27;s being black played a large part in the younger man&#x27;s initial promotion in 2001 to full-time staffer. &quot;I think race was the decisive factor in his promotion,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought then and I think now that it was the wrong decision.&quot;

Others disagreed. Five days later, &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed columnist Bob Herbert, an African American, asserted in his column that race had nothing to do with the Blair case:

Listen up: the race issue in this case is as bogus as some of Jayson Blair&#x27;s reporting... [F]olks who delight in attacking anything black, or anything designed to help blacks, have pounced on the Blair story as evidence that there is something inherently wrong with &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s effort to diversify its newsroom, and beyond that, with the very idea of a commitment to diversity or affirmative action anywhere. And while these agitators won&#x27;t admit it, the nasty subtext to their attack is that there is something inherently wrong with blacks.

Executive editor Howell Raines and managing editor Gerald Boyd resigned after losing newsroom support in the aftermath of the scandal.

After resigning from the &quot;Times,&quot; Blair struggled with severe depression and, according to his memoir, entered a hospital for treatment. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder for the first time. He has acknowledged that he had been self-medicating when he was dealing with substance abuse of alcohol and cocaine in earlier years.

==Later career==
Blair later returned to college to complete his postponed degree.

The year after he left the &quot;Times&quot;, Blair wrote a memoir, &quot;Burning Down My Masters&#x27; House&quot;, published by New Millennium Books in 2004. Its initial print run was 250,000 copies; some 1,400 were sold in its first nine days. Although most reviews were critical, sales of the book increased after Blair was interviewed by Larry King and Fox News Channel host Bill O&#x27;Reilly.

In his book, Blair revealed extended substance abuse, which he had ended before he resigned from the newspaper, and a struggle with bipolar disorder, which was diagnosed and first treated after he resigned. He also discussed journalistic practices at the &quot;Times&quot;, and his view of race relations and disagreements among senior editors at the newspaper.

In 2006, Blair was running a support group for people with bipolar disorder, for which he has received continuing treatment.
In 2007 he became a life coach, working in Virginia, opening his own coaching center five years later.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Choke Point&quot;, the play written by Colm Byrne and produced in 2007, is based on Blair&#x27;s downfall.
*A play about Blair, &quot;CQ/CX&quot;, written by Gabe McKinley, was produced by the Atlantic Theater Company in 2012. McKinley knew Blair personally, having worked at the &quot;Times&quot; during the period Blair was there.
* &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; used the Blair story as the inspiration for Episode 14.02: &quot;Bounty.&quot;
* In &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, the Blair story inspired an episode about a young journalist in the third season episode &quot;Pravda&quot; (3.5).
* Season 5 of the HBO series &quot;The Wire&quot; dealt with the subject of journalistic fabrications, as well as the decline of print journalism. It mentions Jayson Blair in the last episode. &quot;The Wire&quot; creator David Simon had been a &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; journalist and worked on &quot;The Diamondback&quot;, the student newspaper at the University of Maryland, College Park, where Blair was editor.
* A 2003 series of &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; comic strips portray Rat writing fraudulent &quot;New York Times&quot; stories about former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
* A scene in &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; episode &quot;The Reigning Lorelai&quot; (4.16) shows Rory&#x27;s editor, Doyle, becoming frustrated with the way &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; staffers act in the newsroom, calling it &quot;the breeding ground for the next Jayson Blair&quot;.
*A documentary film featuring Jayson Blair was made by director/producer Samantha Grant. &quot;A Fragile Trust&quot; premiered at the Sheffield International Documentary Film Festival on June 14, 2013.
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot; based a joke on the Blair story in Episode 15.22, &quot;Fraudcast News&quot;. Milhouse tells Lisa he&#x27;s sorry but a story he &quot;filed from Baghdad was all made up, (he) was actually in Basrah&quot;.
* During the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner in 2008, Craig Ferguson remarked, &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; unfortunately did not buy a table. They feel—I just want to make sure I get this right—they felt that this event undercuts the credibility of the press. It&#x27;s funny, you see I thought that Jayson Blair and Judy Miller took care of that.&quot;
