<text>Raymond Frederick Harryhausen (June 29, 1920 – May 7, 2013) was an American-British animator and special effects creator who created a form of stop motion model animation known as &quot;Dynamation&quot;. His works include the animation for &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1949) with his mentor Willis H. O&#x27;Brien (for which the latter won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects); his first color film, &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1958); and &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963), which featured a sword fight with seven skeleton warriors. His last film was &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (1981), after which he retired from filmmaking.

In 1960, Harryhausen moved to the United Kingdom and became a dual American-British citizen. He lived in London until his death in 2013. During his life, his innovative style of special effects in films inspired numerous filmmakers.

==Early life==
Raymond Frederick Harryhausen was born on June 29, 1920, in Los Angeles, California, the son of Martha L. (née Reske) and Frederick W. Harryhausen. Of German descent, the family surname was originally spelled &quot;Herrenhausen&quot;.

==Life and career==

===1930s and 1940s===
After having seen &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) on its initial release for the first of many times, Harryhausen spent his early years experimenting in the production of animated shorts, inspired by the burgeoning science fiction literary genre of the period. The scenes utilising stop-motion animation (or model animation), those featuring creatures on the island or Kong, were the work of pioneer model animator Willis O&#x27;Brien. His work in &quot;King Kong&quot; inspired Harryhausen, and a friend arranged a meeting with O&#x27;Brien for him. O&#x27;Brien critiqued Harryhausen&#x27;s early models and urged him to take classes in graphic arts and sculpture to hone his skills. Taking O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s advice, while still at high school, Harryhausen took evening classes in art direction, photography and editing at the newly formed School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California, where he would later serve as a lecturer. Meanwhile, he became friends with an aspiring writer, Ray Bradbury, with similar enthusiasms. Bradbury and Harryhausen joined the Los Angeles chapter of the Science Fiction League (now the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society), Bradbury in 1937, Harryhausen in 1939, where they met Forrest J Ackerman; and the three became lifelong friends.

After studying art and anatomy at Los Angeles City College, Harryhausen secured his first commercial model-animation job, on George Pal&#x27;s &quot;Puppetoons&quot; shorts, based on viewing his first formal demo reel of fighting dinosaurs from a project called &quot;Evolution&quot;, which was never finished, after Harryhausen saw Disney&#x27;s &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; montage in &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

During World War II, Harryhausen served in the U.S. Army&#x27;s Special Services Division under Colonel Frank Capra, as a loader, clapper boy, gofer and later camera assistant, whilst working at home animating short films about the use and development of military equipment. During this time, he also worked with composer Dimitri Tiomkin and Ted Geisel (&quot;Dr. Seuss&quot;). Following the war, he salvaged several rolls of discarded 16 mm surplus film from which he made a series of fairy tale-based shorts, which he called his &quot;teething-rings&quot;.

In 1947, Harryhausen was hired as an assistant animator (credited as &quot;First technician, Special Effects&quot;) on what turned out to be his first major film, &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1949).

===1950s===

The first film with Ray Harryhausen in full charge of technical effects was &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (1953) which began development under the working title &quot;Monster From the Sea&quot;. The filmmakers learned that a long-time friend of Harryhausen, writer Ray Bradbury, had sold a short story called &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (later re-titled &quot;The Fog Horn&quot;) to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, about a dinosaur drawn to a lone lighthouse by its foghorn. Because the story for Harryhausen&#x27;s film featured a similar scene, the film studio bought the rights to Bradbury&#x27;s story to avoid any potential legal problems. Also, the title was changed back to &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;. Under that title, it became Harryhausen&#x27;s first solo feature film effort, and a major international box-office hit for Warner Brothers.

It was on &quot;The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms&quot; that Harryhausen first used a technique he created called &quot;Dynamation&quot; which split the background and foreground of pre-shot live action footage into two separate images into which he would animate a model or models, seemingly integrating the live-action with the models. The background would be used as a miniature rear-screen with his models animated in front of it, re-photographed with an animation-capable camera to combine those two elements together, the foreground element matted out to leave a black space. Then the film was rewound, and everything except the foreground element matted out so that the foreground element would now photograph in the previously blacked-out area. This created the effect that the animated model was &quot;sandwiched&quot; in between the two live-action elements, right into the final live action scene.

In most of Harryhausen&#x27;s films, model animated characters interact with, and are a part of, the live action world, with the idea that they will cease to call attention to themselves as only &quot;animation.&quot; Most of the effects shots in his earliest films were created via Harryhausen&#x27;s careful frame-by-frame control of the lighting of both the set and the projector. This dramatically reduced much of degradation common in the use of back-projection or the creation of dupe negatives via the use of an optical printer. Harryhausen&#x27;s use of diffused glass to soften the sharpness of light on the animated elements allowed the matching of the soft background plates far more successfully than Willis O&#x27;Brien had achieved in his early films, allowing Harryhausen to match live and miniature elements seamlessly in most of his shots. By developing and executing most of this miniature work himself, Harryhausen saved money, while maintaining full technical control.
A few years later, when Harryhausen began working with color film to make &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, he experimented extensively with color film stocks to overcome the color-balance-shift problems. Ray&#x27;s producer/partner Charles H. Schneer coined the word Dynamation as a &quot;merchandising term&quot; (modifying it to &quot;SuperDynaMation&quot; and then &quot;Dynarama&quot; for some subsequent films).

Harryhausen was always heavily involved in the pre-production conceptualizing of each film&#x27;s story, script development, art-direction, design, storyboards, and general tone of his films, as much as any &quot;auteur&quot; director would have on any other film, which any &quot;director&quot; of Harryhausen&#x27;s films had to understand and agree to work under. The complexities of the Directors Guild of America&#x27;s rules prevented Harryhausen from being credited as the director of his films, resulting in the more modest credits he had in most of his films.

Throughout most of his career, Harryhausen&#x27;s work was a sort of family affair. His father did the machining of the metal armatures (based on his son&#x27;s designs) that were the skeletons for the models and allowed them to keep their position, while his mother assisted with some miniature costumes. After Harryhausen&#x27;s father died in 1973, Harryhausen contracted his armature work out to another machinist. An occasional assistant, George Lofgren, a taxidermist, assisted Harryhausen with the creation of furred creatures. Another associate, Willis Cook, built some of Harryhausen&#x27;s miniature sets. Other than that, Harryhausen worked generally alone to produce almost all of the animation for his films.

The same year that &quot;Beast&quot; was released, 1953, fledgling film producer Irwin Allen released a live action documentary about life in the oceans titled &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot;, which won an Oscar for best documentary feature film of that year. Allen&#x27;s and Harryhausen&#x27;s paths would cross three years later, on Allen&#x27;s sequel to this film.

Harryhausen soon met and began a fruitful partnership with producer Charles H. Schneer, who was working with the Sam Katzman B-picture unit of Columbia Pictures. Their first tandem project was &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Monster from Beneath the Sea&quot;, 1955), about a giant octopus attacking San Francisco. It was a box-office success, quickly followed by &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot; (1956), set in Washington D.C. – one of the best of the alien invasion films of the 1950s, and also a box office hit.

In 1954, Irwin Allen had started work on a second feature-length documentary film, this one about animal life on land called &quot;The Animal World&quot; (completed in 1956). Needing an opening sequence about dinosaurs, Allen hired premier model animator Willis O&#x27;Brien to animate the dinosaurs, but then gave him a practically impossibly short production schedule. O&#x27;Brien again hired Harryhausen to help with animation to complete the eight-minute sequence. It was Harryhausen&#x27;s and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s first and only professional full-color work. (&quot;Animal World&quot; is available on the DVD release of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s 1957 film &quot;The Black Scorpion&quot;.)
Harryhausen then returned to Columbia and Charles Schneer to make &quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot; (1957), about an American spaceship returning from the planet Venus. The spaceship crashes into the sea near Sicily, releasing an on-board alien egg specimen which washes up on shore. The egg soon hatches a creature that, in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, rapidly grows to gigantic size and terrifies the citizens of Rome. Harryhausen refined and improved his already-considerable ability at establishing emotional characterizations in the face of his Venusian &quot;Ymir&quot; model, creating yet another international box office hit.

Schneer was eager to graduate to full-color films. Reluctant at first, Harryhausen managed to develop the systems necessary to maintain proper color balances for his DynaMation process, resulting in his biggest hit of the 1950s, &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1958). The top-grossing film of that summer, and one of the top-grossing films of that year, Schneer and Harryhausen signed another deal with Columbia for four more color films.

===1960s===

After &quot;The 3 Worlds of Gulliver&quot; (1960) and &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (1961), both great artistic and technical successes, and successful at the box office, according to Harryhausen, who stated in the DVD and Blu-ray featurette about the making of &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;: &quot;&quot;Mysterious Island&quot; was one of the most successful films that we made and I am glad people are still enjoying it today&quot;. And &quot;Gulliver&quot; &quot;made its profits&quot; as Ray is quoted in Jeff Rovin&#x27;s bio-book &quot;From The Land Beyond Beyond: The Making of the Movie Monsters You&#x27;ve Known and Loved – The Films of Willis O&#x27;Brien and Ray Harryhausen&quot;. His next film is considered by film historians and fans as Harryhausen&#x27;s masterwork, &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963). Among the film&#x27;s several celebrated animation sequences is an extended fight between three actors and seven living skeletons, a considerable advance on the single-skeleton fight scene in &quot;Sinbad&quot;. This stop-motion sequence took over four months to complete.

Harryhausen next made &quot;First Men in the Moon&quot; (1964), his only film made in the 2.35:1 widescreen (a.k.a. &quot;CinemaScope&quot;) format, based on the novel by H. G. Wells. &quot;Jason&quot; and &quot;First Men in the Moon&quot; were box office disappointments at the time of their original theatrical release. That, plus changes of management at Columbia Pictures, resulted in his contract with Columbia Picture not being renewed. Also, as the 1960s counter-culture came to influence more and more and younger filmmakers, and failing studios struggled to find material that was popular with the new &quot;Boomer-generation&quot; audience, Harryhausen&#x27;s love of the past, setting his stories in ancient fantasy worlds or previous centuries, kept him from keeping pace with changing tastes in the 1960s. Only a handful of Harryhausen&#x27;s features have been set in then-present time, and none in the future. As this revolution in the traditional Hollywood film studio system, and the influx of a new generation of film makers sorted itself out, Harryhausen became a free agent.

Harryhausen was then hired by Hammer Films to animate the dinosaurs for &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; (1966). It was a success at the box office, helped in part by the presence of Raquel Welch in her second film. Harryhausen next went on to make another dinosaur film, &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; with Schneer. The project had been developed for Columbia, who declined. Schneer then made a deal with Warner Brothers instead. It was a personal project to Harryhausen, which he had wanted to do for many years, as it was storyboarded by his original mentor, Willis O&#x27;Brien for a 1939 film, &quot;Gwangi&quot;, that was never completed. Set in Mexico, &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; is a parallel &quot;Kong&quot; story—cowboys capture a living &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and bring him to the nearest Mexican town for exhibition. Sabotage releases the creature, and it wreaks havoc on the town. The film features a roping scene reminiscent of 1949&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (which was itself recycled from the old &quot;Gwangi&quot; storyboards), and a spectacular fire and animation sequence inside a cathedral toward the end of the film, combining multiple special effects.

===1970s–1990s===
After a few lean years, Harryhausen and Schneer talked Columbia Pictures into reviving the Sinbad character, resulting in &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, often remembered for the sword fight involving a statue of the six-armed Hindu goddess Kali. It was first released in Los Angeles in the Christmas season of 1973, but garnered its main audience in the spring and summer of 1974. It was followed by &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot; (1977), which disappointed some fans because of its tongue-in-cheek approach. Both films were, however, box office successes.

Schneer and Harryhausen finally were allowed by MGM to produce a big budget film with name actors and an expanded effects budget. The film started out smaller, but then MGM increased the budget to hire stars such as Laurence Olivier. It became the last feature film to showcase his effects work, &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (1981), for which he was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Special Effects. For this film, he hired protégé model animators Steve Archer and two-time Oscar-nominated Jim Danforth to assist with major animation sequences. Harryhausen fans will readily discern that the armed-and-finned Kraken (a name borrowed from medieval Scandinavian folklore) he invented for &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; has similar facial qualities to the Venusian Ymir he created 25 years earlier for &quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot;.

Perhaps because of his hermetic production style and the fact that he produced half of his films outside of Hollywood (living in London since 1960), reducing his day-to-day kinship with other more traditional, but still influential Hollywood effects artists, none of Harryhausen&#x27;s films were nominated for a special effects Oscar. Harryhausen himself says the reason was that he worked in Europe, but this oversight by the AMPAS visual-effects committee also occurred throughout the 1950s when Harryhausen lived in Los Angeles.

In spite of the very successful box office returns of &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;, more sophisticated computer-assisted technology developed by ILM and others began to eclipse Harryhausen&#x27;s production techniques, and so MGM and other studios passed on funding his planned sequel, &quot;Force of the Trojans&quot;, causing Harryhausen and Schneer to retire from active filmmaking.

In the early 1970s, Harryhausen had also concentrated his efforts on authoring a book, &quot;Film Fantasy Scrapbook&quot; (produced in three editions as his last three films were released), and supervising the restoration and release of (eventually all) his films to VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, and currently Blu-ray. A second book followed, &quot;Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life&quot;, written with author and friend Tony Dalton, which details his techniques and history. This was then followed in 2005 by &quot;The Art of Ray Harryhausen&quot;, featuring sketches and drawings for his many projects, some of them unrealized. In 2008, Harryhausen and Dalton published a history of stop-motion model animation, &quot;A Century of Model Animation&quot;, and, to celebrate Harryhausen&#x27;s 90th birthday, the Ray &amp; Diana Harryhausen Foundation published &quot;Ray Harryhausen – A Life in Pictures&quot;. In 2011, Harryhausen and Dalton&#x27;s last volume, called &quot;Ray Harryhausen&#x27;s Fantasy Scrapbook&quot;, was also published.

Harryhausen continued his lifelong friendship with Ray Bradbury until Bradbury&#x27;s death in 2012. Another longtime close friend was &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; magazine editor, book writer, and sci-fi collector Forrest J Ackerman, who loaned Harryhausen his photos of &quot;King Kong&quot; in 1933, right after Harryhausen had seen the film for the first time. Harryhausen also maintained his friendships with his longtime producer, Charles H. Schneer, who lived next door to him in a suburb of London until Schneer moved full-time to the U.S. (a few years later, in early 2009, Schneer died at 88 in Boca Raton, Florida); and with model animation protégé, Jim Danforth, still living in the Los Angeles area.

Harryhausen and Terry Moore appeared in small comedic cameo roles in the 1998 remake of &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;, and he provided the voice of a polar bear cub in the film &quot;Elf&quot;. He also appears as a bar patron in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot;, and as a doctor in the John Landis film &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;. In 2010, Harryhausen had a brief cameo in &quot;Burke &amp; Hare&quot;, a British film directed by Landis.

In 1986, Harryhausen formed the Ray &amp; Diana Harryhausen Foundation, a registered charity in the U.K. and U.S. that preserves his collection and promotes the art of stop-motion animation and Harryhausen&#x27;s contributions to the genre.

===2000s–2010s===
TidalWave Productions&#x27; &quot;Ray Harryhausen Signature Series&quot; produced authorized comic-book adaptions of some of Harryhausen&#x27;s unrealized projects from 2007 on.

In 2009, he released self-colorized versions on Blu-Ray video of three of his classic black-and-white Columbia films: &quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot;, &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot;, and &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea&quot;. He also personally supervised the colorization of three films, two of them in partial tribute to their producer Merian C. Cooper, who had supervised &quot;King Kong&quot;, the film that inspired him as a young man: &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; (1932), &quot;She&quot; (1935), and the non-Cooper film &quot;Things to Come&quot; (1936).

==Personal life==
Harryhausen married Diana Livingstone Bruce in October, 1962. The couple had a daughter, Vanessa.

==Death and legacy==
The family announced Harryhausen&#x27;s death on Twitter and Facebook on May 7, 2013 and a representative of the family confirmed his death to the BBC as well as by CBS News and confirmed by his former friend and biographer, Tony Dalton. Diana survived her husband by five months.

Harryhausen was buried in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Brooke, Norfolk. 

The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; quoted Harryhausen&#x27;s website, saying his &quot;influence on today&#x27;s film makers was enormous, with luminaries; Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, George Lucas, John Landis and the U.K.&#x27;s own Nick Park have cited Harryhausen as being the man whose work inspired their own creations.&quot; Harryhausen drew a distinction between films that combine special effects animation with live action and films that are completely animated, such those of Nick Park, Henry Selick, Ivo Caprino, Ladislav Starevich (and his own fairy tale shorts), which he saw as pure &quot;puppet films&quot;, and which are more accurately (and traditionally) called &quot;puppet animation&quot;.

The BBC quoted Peter Lord of Aardman Animations, who wrote on Twitter that Harryhausen was &quot;a one-man industry and a one-man genre&quot;. The BBC also quoted &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; director Edgar Wright: &quot;I loved every single frame of Ray Harryhausen&#x27;s work ... He was the man who made me believe in monsters.&quot; In a full statement released by the family, George Lucas said, &quot;Without Ray Harryhausen, there would likely have been no &quot;Star Wars&quot;&quot;. Terry Gilliam said, &quot;What we do now digitally with computers, Ray did digitally long before but without computers. Only with his digits.&quot; James Cameron said, &quot;I think all of us who are practitioners in the arts of science fiction and fantasy movies now all feel that we&#x27;re standing on the shoulders of a giant. If not for Ray&#x27;s contribution to the collective dreamscape, we wouldn&#x27;t be who we are.&quot;

John Walsh, author of &quot;&quot;, calls Harryhausen &quot;the most influential stop-motion animator and special-effects wizard in cinema history.&quot;

In November 2016 the BFI compiled a list of those present-day filmmakers who claim to have been inspired by Harryhausen, including Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, Joe Dante, Tim Burton, Nick Park, James Cameron, and Guillermo del Toro. Others influenced by him include George Lucas, John Lasseter, John Landis, Henry Selick, J. J. Abrams, Wes Anderson, Robert Rodriguez, special effects supervisors Phil Tippett, and Dennis Muren, and video game creator David Jaffe.

==Foundation==
Harryhausen left his collection, which includes all of his film-related artifacts, to the Ray &amp; Diana Harryhausen Foundation, which he set up in 1986 to look after his extensive collection, to protect his name and to further the art of model stop-motion animation. The trustees are his daughter Vanessa Harryhausen, Simon Mackintosh, actress Caroline Munro, who appeared in &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot; and film maker John Walsh, who first met Harryhausen in 1988 as a student at the London Film School and made the documentary &quot;Ray Harryhausen: Movement Into Life&quot;, narrated by &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Tom Baker. The foundation&#x27;s website charts progress on the restoration of the collection and plans for Harryhausen&#x27;s legacy.

In 2013, the RH foundation and Arrow Films released a feature-length biography of Harryhausen and his films, &quot;Ray Harryhausen – Special Effects Titan&quot;, on Blu-Ray. Featuring photos, artifacts, and film clips culled directly from Harryhausen&#x27;s estate and never before seen by the public, the film was initially released only in the U.K., but was released on Blu-Ray in the U.S. in 2016.

In February 2016, John Walsh and Collections Manager Connor Heaney began a podcast about all things Harryhausen, from the films to the various composers involved on the productions. Occasionally the podcast features interviews with fans, as well as insights into Harryhausen&#x27;s models from Foundation model conservator Alan Friswell. The podcast has featured Mark Gatiss, John Cairney, Caroline Munro, and Vanessa Harryhausen.

Some of Harryhausen&#x27;s models and artworks were showcased as part of the Barbican Centre&#x27;s &#x27;Into the Unknown&#x27; exhibition from June 3 to September 1, 2017. To mark his 97th birthday on July 29, 2017, the Barbican posted a guest blog by Heaney, highlighting Harryhausen&#x27;s lasting influence on science fiction.

On June 5, 2017, it was announced that a major exhibition of Harryhausen&#x27;s models, &quot;Ray Harryhausen—Mythical Menagerie&quot;, would take place at the Science Museum Oklahoma. The exhibition opened on July 29. USA Today called it &quot;one of best museum exhibits in the U.S. this fall&quot;. In 2018 the exhibition was nominated for a Rondo Hatton Award for &quot;Best Live Event&quot;.

An exhibition at Tate Britain from June 26 to November 19, 2017, features work from the Harryhausen collection and short film made by John Walsh on the restoration of a painting owned by Harryhausen which influenced his work.

In September 2018, Titan Books published &quot;Harryhausen – The Movie Posters&quot; by author Richard Holliss, focusing on the various movie posters associated with Harryhausen&#x27;s films from across the globe.

In September 2019, Foundation trustee, Titan Books published a new book by Walsh, which delves into the hidden treasures of Ray&#x27;s unrealised film projects. On the 15th September, a book launch and signing event was held at the Forbidden Planet London Megastore, and was followed up with a 4K screening of &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;. In a podcast interview with BritFlicks, Walsh discussed his plans to further develop lost Ray Harryhausen film projects, which includes the follow-up to 1981&#x27;s &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;, entitled &quot;Force of the Trojans&quot;.

An exhibition opened showing items from the Harryhausen collection at the Valence House Museum on March 14, 2018. The exhibition was inspired by local man Alan Friswell, who worked with Ray Harryhausen on the creatures&#x27; restorations. It was funded by Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council.

==Centenary==
In July 2018, it was announced that the largest ever exhibition of Harryhausen&#x27;s models and artwork would take place at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh, to mark the centenary of his birth. The exhibition was planned to run for a year, from October 2020 until September 2021. Ultimately, the exhibition was extended to end in February 2022. The exhibition was the subject of a BBC iPlayer documentary entitled &quot;Culture in Quarantine&quot;, which featured interviews with Vanessa Harryhausen, Caroline Munro and Martine Beswick, as well as footage from &quot;Ray Harryhausen: Movement into Life&quot;. Many of Harryhausen&#x27;s original latex models were repaired for this exhibition: in an interview with the Visual Effects Society, Walsh said that &quot;We’re restoring pieces as we go, trying to get things back as close to how people remember them as possible&quot;.

It was also announced that Vanessa Harryhausen was writing a book to mark her father&#x27;s centenary, to accompany the exhibition in Edinburgh. Also entitled &quot;Ray Harryhausen: Titan of Cinema&quot;, the book looks back on his personal and professional life through Vanessa&#x27;s 100 favourite objects from his collection, and contains contributions from John Landis, Rick Baker, Phil Tippett, Jim Danforth and others.

In 2021, it was announced that The Ray Harryhausen Award would be launched to celebrate Ray&#x27;s influence on contemporary filmmakers and animators. The first awards ceremony took place on what would have been Ray&#x27;s 102nd birthday, in June 2022. The movie &quot;Mad God&quot; won the inaugural award for best feature film, and six other winners were selected across a range of categories.

== The Gordon E. Sawyer Academy Award ==
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Harryhausen&#x27;s fans who had graduated into the professional film industry started lobbying The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to acknowledge Harryhausen&#x27;s contribution to the film industry, and so, in 1992, the academy finally awarded him the Gordon E. Sawyer Award (effectively a lifetime achievement &quot;Oscar&quot;) for &quot;technological contributions [which] have brought credit to the industry&quot;, with actor Tom Hanks (as the Master of Ceremonies) and Ray Bradbury (a friend from when they were both just out of high school) presenting the award to him. After the presentation to Harryhausen, actor Tom Hanks told the audience, &quot;Some people say &quot;Casablanca&quot; or &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;...I say &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; is the greatest film ever made!&quot;

==In popular culture==

Fan and filmmaker tributes to Harryhausen abound in many forms.
* In the 1994 TV series &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, episode 5: &quot;The Menace Of Mysterio&quot; Spider-Man says &quot;Great! Now I&#x27;ve stepped into a Ray Harryhausen movie!&quot; when he is in the final confrontation with Mysterio and fights off some classic Greek monsters. 
* In the video game &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, three characters are Harryhausen-inspired, specifically Spinal, Eyedol, and Gargos.
* The Mythos Games/Virgin Interactive Entertainment computer game &quot;Magic and Mayhem&quot; (1999) features over 25 stop-motion mythological creatures that were inspired by Harryhausen&#x27;s work. Constructed by special effects expert and stop-motion animator Alan Friswell, the various characters include a dragon, a centaur, a griffin and a fighting skeleton. For the griffin&#x27;s wing animation, Friswell studied the griffin from &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1974). Friswell subsequently worked for the Ray and Diana Harryhausen Foundation, restoring many of the original animation models used in Harryhausen&#x27;s films. Friswell still holds the position of official restorer for the Foundation.
* The 1992 comedy-horror film &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; features the titular army resembling the army of skeletons from &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;.
* In the 2001 Disney/Pixar animated film &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; pays homage to Harryhausen in a scene where James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan, Mike Wazowski, Boo, Celia Mae and other monsters visit a Japanese and sushi restaurant named Harryhausen&#x27;s in Monstropolis.
* Tim Burton considers his satiric science fiction movie &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996) to be a tribute to Harryhausen, especially in a scene in which one of the hostile Martians&#x27; flying saucers chops down the Washington Monument by crashing into it, just as Harryhausen had done in his movie &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot; in 1956.
* In 2007, fantasy comic book author/illustrator Stephen D. Sullivan dedicated his novel &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Bones&quot; to Harryhausen and comic book creator Stan Lee. &quot;For stoking the fires of my imagination.&quot; In the book, which is part of the &quot;&quot; series, the heroine must battle a rampaging clockwork giant.
* The &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; episode &quot;Little Gift Shop of Horrors&quot; (specifically the &quot;Clay Day&quot; segment), has several references to Ray Harryhausen and his work.
* In the 2005 film &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;, while Victor is at Victoria&#x27;s house, he plays the piano, which is labelled as a &quot;Harryhausen&quot;.
* The 2007 song &quot;Worried About Ray&quot; by English pop rock band the Hoosiers is inspired by and is about Harryhausen.
* A short clay-animation film, &quot;Martian Peen Worm&quot; (here abridged from a much longer title) made in the 1970s in Texas by Ivan Stang of Church of the SubGenius fame, refers to the worm at one stage of its growth-development as a &quot;Nesuahyrrah&quot; (Harryhausen spelled backwards).
* Another 17-minute short film made in 2005, &quot;Southwestern Orange County vs. the Flying Saucers&quot;, uses identical saucer models to Harryhausen&#x27;s similarly titled 1956 alien invasion movie.
* In &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; Season 4 Episode 5 &quot;The Revenge Society&quot;, Red Mantle sarcastically compares Phantom Limb to Ray Harryhausen. Harryhausen is also mentioned in Season 5 Episode 2 &quot;Spanikopita!&quot; by Billy Quizboy&#x27;s nemesis, Augustus St. Cloud, who shows off the movie prop Bubo, from &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;, stating &quot;Harryhausen&#x27;s a friend.&quot;
* Harryhausen was the subject of the song &quot;Monster&quot;, the title track of former Stranglers singer Hugh Cornwell&#x27;s 2018 solo album.
* In March 1983, Harryhausen participated in a special one-day event at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theater celebrating the 50th anniversary of premiere screening of the 1933 &quot;King Kong&quot; in the same theater. Visual effects technicians from several film-effects facilities recreated the life-sized bust of Kong as it appeared in the theater&#x27;s outer lobby area 50 years earlier. The August 1983 issue of &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; features three articles about the event.
*The 2013 film &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; included a dedication to &quot;monster masters Ray Harryhausen and Ishirō Honda&quot;.

<text>The Franklin Institute is a science museum and a center of science education and research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is named after the American scientist and Benjamin Franklin. It houses the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial. Founded in 1824, the Franklin Institute is one of the oldest centers of science education and development in the United States. Its chief astronomer is Derrick Pitts.

==History==
===19th century===
On February 5, 1824, Samuel Vaughan Merrick and William H. Keating founded the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts. The opening was chronicled by &quot;The Literary Chronicle for the Year 1824&quot;:

Begun in 1825, the institute was an important force in the professionalization of American science and technology through the nineteenth century, beginning with early investigations into steam engines and water power. In addition to conducting scientific inquiry, it fostered research and education by running schools, publishing the influential &quot;Journal of The Franklin Institute&quot;, sponsoring exhibitions, and recognizing scientific advancement and invention with medals and awards.

===20th century===
In the late 20th century, the institute&#x27;s research roles gave way to educating the general public through its museum. The Bartol Research Foundation of the Franklin Institute, founded in 1924 to conduct research in the physical sciences, now is part of the University of Delaware and named Bartol Research Institute. The Franklin Institute Laboratories for Research and Development operated from the Second World War into the 1980s.

Many scientists have demonstrated groundbreaking new technology at the Franklin Institute. From September 2 to October 11, 1884, it hosted the International Electrical Exhibition of 1884, the first great electrical exposition in the United States. The world&#x27;s first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system was later given by Philo Taylor Farnsworth on August 25, 1934.

The first female member, Elizabeth Skinner, was elected to membership in 1833. The Franklin Institute was integrated in 1870, when Philadelphia teacher and activist Octavius Catto was admitted as a member.

The institute&#x27;s original building at 15 South 7th Street, later the home of the (now-defunct) Atwater Kent Museum, eventually proved too small for the institute&#x27;s research, educational programs, and library. The Institute moved into its current home on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, near the intersection with 20th Street, in 1934. The new facility was intended from the start to educate visitors through hand-on interactions with exhibits: &quot;Visitors to this museum would be encouraged to touch, handle, and operate the exhibits in order to learn how things work.&quot; Funds to build the new Institute and Franklin Memorial came from the Poor Richard Club, the City Board of Trust, the Benjamin Franklin Memorial, Inc., and the Franklin Institute. John T. Windrim&#x27;s original design was a completely square building surrounding the Benjamin Franklin Statue, which had yet to be built. Despite the effects of the Great Depression, the Benjamin Franklin Memorial, Inc. raised $5 million between December 1929 and June 1930. Only two of the four wings envisioned by Windrim were built; these face the Parkway and share design elements with other cultural and civic structures around Logan Circle.

On March 31, 1940, press agent William Castellini issued a press release stating that the world would end the next day. The story was picked up by KYW, which reported, &quot;Your worst fears that the world will end are confirmed by astronomers of Franklin Institute, Philadelphia. Scientists predict that the world will end at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time tomorrow. This is no April Fool joke. Confirmation can be obtained from Wagner Schlesinger, director of the Fels Planetarium of this city.&quot; This caused a panic in the city which only subsided when the Franklin Institute assured people it had made no such prediction. Castellini was dismissed shortly thereafter.

===21st century===
On December 21, 2017, during a party hosted by the museum, a partygoer with his companions slipped into a closed-off exhibit of ten Terracotta Army warriors on loan from China. After his companions left, the partygoer broke off and stole a thumb from one of the warriors. Law enforcement agents later recovered the stolen thumb. The vandalized cavalryman is valued at US$4.5 million, and is considered a &quot;priceless part of China&#x27;s cultural heritage&quot;. The vandalism stoked outrage in Chinese media, such as Xinhua. The Franklin Institute blamed its external security contractor, and stated it had reviewed its security measures and procedures to prevent such situations from recurring. The defendant was charged both with theft, and with concealment of an item of cultural heritage.

The defense argued that the defendant was being &quot;overcharged&quot; under statutes applicable to professional art thieves. An April 2019 trial ended in a hung jury with seven of the 12 jurors in favor of acquittal. A February 2020 retrial was postponed due to travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, the institute housed the work of Dyymond Whipper-Young as she broke the Guinness world record for the &quot;world&#x27;s largest drawing by an individual&quot;.

===Capital campaign===

In 2006, the Franklin Institute began fundraising activities for the Inspire Science! capital campaign, a $64.7 million campaign intended to fund the construction of a building addition, new exhibits, and upgrades and renovations to the existing Institute building and exhibits.

In 2011, the Franklin Institute received a $10 million gift from Athena and Nicholas Karabots towards the Inspire Science! capital campaign. This gift is the largest gift in the institute&#x27;s history, and put the Franklin Institute within $6 million of the $64.7 million capital campaign goal. The Nicholas and Athena Karabots Pavilion will house not only a $10 million multiroom exhibit on neuroscience, but also a conference center, classroom space, and additional room for traveling exhibitions.

==The Science Center==
The most recognizable part of the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Science Center is the Franklin Institute Science Museum. In the spirit of inquiry and discovery embodied by Benjamin Franklin, the mission of the Franklin Institute Science Museum serves to inspire an understanding of and passion for science and technology learning. Among other exhibits, the Science Museum holds the largest collection of artifacts from the Wright brothers&#x27; workshop.

===Permanent exhibits===

*&quot;Electricity&quot;, which replaced &quot;Franklin...He&#x27;s Electric&quot; in 2010, showcases Franklin&#x27;s discovery of electricity and its use in the modern world, including elements such as a sustainable dance floor, and an array of LEDs that turn on in the presence of cell phone signals and other low-power electrical signals. (Electricity and Technology)
*&quot;Changing Earth&quot;, which opened to the public, along with &quot;Electricity&quot;, on March 27, 2010, focuses on the powerful forces of air, water, and land and their effect upon the earth, as well as how humans respond to and interact with these forces.
*&quot;The Franklin Airshow&quot; features The Wright Brothers Aeronautical Engineering Collection, their newly restored Wright Model B airplane, and a United States Air Force 1948 T-33 Shooting Star jet trainer. (Aviation and Technology)
*&quot;The Giant Heart&quot; has been a Philadelphia icon since its opening in 1954. (Biology, Chemistry and Anatomy)
*&quot;Joel N. Bloom Observatory&quot;, remodeled in 2006, features five telescopes, including a very large Zeiss Refractor and four Meade Reflectors.
*&quot;SportsZone&quot; is an interactive exhibit that shows the science behind sports. (Physics and Technology)
*&quot;The Train Factory&quot; has a real, once movable train: The Baldwin 60000 steam locomotive, which was rolled into the museum while the building&#x27;s walls were still being constructed. The 60000&#x27;s track is itself the top level of a full-size exhibit on bridge engineering in the museum basement and long closed to the public. Along with 60000, the Institute has two other steam locomotives, both from the early 19th century. This exhibit is currently closed for an extensive renovation and is expected to reopen in the fall of 2024. (History, Engineering, and Technology)
*&quot;Sir Isaac&#x27;s Loft&quot; allows visitors to blend art and science into their own masterpiece. (Physics and Art)
*&quot;Space Command&quot; features real space suits and allows visitors to track their houses, in real time, via satellite. (Astronomy, Technology, and Mathematics)
* The Franklin Institute installed &quot;Foxtrot Papa&quot;, a former British Airways Boeing 707 airliner, as a permanent exhibit in the mid-1970s. Standing above an outdoor Science Park and connected to the second-floor aviation hall by skybridges, this aircraft could easily be seen from the outside of the building and was a remarkable sight in the middle of a major city. In the 1980s, however, the aircraft was sold for scrap, much to the dismay of local aviation enthusiasts.
*&quot;Amazing Machine&quot; allows visitors to experience a machine-like environment featuring little-seen pieces from the Franklin Institute&#x27;s priceless collection, including Maillardet&#x27;s automaton.
*&quot;Your Brain&quot; explores the physiology and neurology of our most remarkable organ. The exhibit includes an 18-foot-tall Luckey Climber climbing structure that simulates neural pathways sending messages, and an area to discuss questions of neuroscience ethics, in addition to 70 interactive learning experiences.

===Other attractions===

The Science Center includes many pertinent attractions that are not museum exhibits. The Budd BB-1 &quot;Pioneer&quot; flying boat, in front of the museum, was the world&#x27;s first stainless steel airplane, built by Philadelphia-based Edward F. Budd Manufacturing Corporation, and has been on display since 1935.

A mock-up which would eventually become the Lunar Module in the Apollo space program, first shown on display in the 1966–67 World&#x27;s Fair, held in the New York Hall of Science, is also located on the grounds. (See photo.)

===Theaters===
In 1933, Samuel Simeon Fels contributed funds to build The Fels Planetarium, only the second built in the United States after Chicago&#x27;s Adler Planetarium. Fully reconstructed in 2002, the Planetarium&#x27;s new design includes replacement of the original 40,000-pound stainless steel dome, originally built in 1933. The new premium dome is lighter and is in diameter. It is the first of its kind in the United States. The planetarium is also outfitted for visitors who are hearing impaired.

The Tuttleman IMAX Theater is an IMAX dome theater that is 180° encompassing and tilted at 30 degrees. The seating places the audience up in the dome which is over across and 4.5 stories tall. In addition, the theater has 20,000 watts of amplifier power and over 50 speakers. The theater was closed in 2020 due to COVID-19, and did not reopen with the rest of the museum. In November 2023, the Franklin Institute confirmed that the theater would remain closed permanently, citing that it was financially unviable and had outdated equipment, and that the museum would be investing in other new exhibits instead.

Early in 2008, extensive renovation of the museum&#x27;s auditorium was completed. Previously a lecture hall, the space was renamed Franklin Theater, and features 3-D and hi-def Blu-ray digital projection capabilities. The Franklin Theater shows educational films during daytime hours while also including mass release feature-length films.

===Traveling exhibits===

In the past, the Science Center has hosted many traveling exhibits including &quot;Storms&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Grossology&quot;, &quot;Body Worlds&quot;, &quot;Darwin&quot;, and &quot;Robots&quot;. In the summer of 2007, the Franklin Institute hosted &quot;Tutankhamun and The Golden Age of The Pharaohs,&quot; in the Mandell Center of the Franklin Institute Science Museum. The exhibit began its United States Tour in Los Angeles, and went to Fort Lauderdale, and Chicago, before coming to Philadelphia for its final American appearance. When the exhibit left Philadelphia on September 30, 2007, it traveled to London.

This exhibit was nearly twice the size of the original Tutankhamun exhibit of the 1970s, and contained 50 objects directly from Tut&#x27;s tomb, as well as nearly 70 object from the tombs of his ancestors in The Valley of the Kings. The show also featured a CAT Scan that revealed what the Boy King may have looked like.

The Franklin Institute is a member of the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC) and the American Alliance of Museums (AAM).

The Franklin Institute is also a member of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative with the Fort Worth Museum of Science &amp; History; the Museum of Science, Boston; COSI Columbus, formerly known as the &quot;Center of Science and Industry&quot; in Columbus, Ohio; OMSI in Portland, Oregon; the Science Museum of Minnesota in Saint Paul, Minnesota; and the California Science Center, formerly the California Museum of Science &amp; Industry, in Los Angeles.

===Benjamin Franklin National Memorial===
The Benjamin Franklin National Memorial features a high marble statue, sculpted by James Earle Fraser. Originally opened in 1938, the Memorial was designed by architect John T. Windrim and modeled after the Pantheon in Rome. The Hall is in length, width, and height. The domed ceiling is self-supporting and weighs 1600 tons. The floors, walls, columns, pilasters, and cornices are made of marbles imported from Portugal, Italy, and France.
The United States Congress designated the Hall and statue as the official Benjamin Franklin National Memorial on October 25, 1972 (). The Memorial was dedicated by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in 1976.

On December 30, 2005, Congress authorized the institute to receive up to $10 million in matching grants for the rehabilitation of the memorial and for the development of related exhibits.

In the fall of 2008, the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial was re-opened after a summer-long restoration that included multimedia enhancements. Philadelphia&#x27;s most famous citizen is featured in &quot;Benjamin Franklin Forever&quot;, an hourly 3.5-minute multimedia presentation utilizing the entire rotunda.

Also noteworthy is the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Frankliniana Collection, some of which is on rotating display in the Pendulum Staircase. Highlights include Franklin&#x27;s 1777 Nini Medallion, the scale model of the bust from the statue in the Memorial, the figurehead of Franklin&#x27;s bust from the frigate , his ceremonial sword used in the court of King Louis XVI, and the odometer that Franklin used to measure the postal routes in Philadelphia. Additionally, the institute&#x27;s &quot;Electricity&quot; exhibition highlights one of Franklin&#x27;s lightning rods, his electricity tube, a Franklin Electrostatic Generator, the 1751 publication of Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Experiments and Observations on Electricity&quot;, and Thornton Oakley&#x27;s two 1940 historical murals of Franklin and the &quot;Kite and Key&quot; experiment.

===&quot;The Journal of The Franklin Institute&quot;===
In 1826, &quot;The Journal of The Franklin Institute&quot; was established to publish US Patent information and to document scientific and technological achievements throughout the nation. It is the second oldest continuously published scientific journal in the country, and is now primarily devoted to engineering and applied mathematics.

===Awards=== 
Since 1824, the Franklin Institute has maintained the longest continuously awarded science and technology awards program in the United States, and one of the oldest in the world. The first issue of the &quot;Journal of The Franklin Institute&quot;, dated January 1826, makes the first written reference to these awards. Before 1998 several medals were awarded by the Franklin Institute, such as (year indicates when the award was first presented): the Elliott Cresson Medal (1875), the Edward Longstreth Medal (1890), the Howard N. Potts Medal (1911), the Franklin Medal (1915), the George R. Henderson Medal (1924), the Louis E. Levy Medal (1924), the John Price Wetherill Medal (1926), The Frank P. Brown Medal (first awarded in 1941), Stuart Ballantine Medal (1947), and the Albert A. Michelson Medal (1968). Past winners include Henry Ford, Frank Lloyd Wright, Marie Curie, and Thomas Edison.

In 1998 all of the endowed medals were reorganized as the Benjamin Franklin Medals. Multiple medals are given every year, for different fields of science and engineering. The fields awarded today are &quot;Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Computer and Cognitive Science&quot;, &quot;Earth and Environmental Science&quot;, &quot;Electrical Engineering&quot;, &quot;Life Science&quot;, &quot;Mechanical Engineering&quot; and &quot;Physics&quot;. In the past also the fields &quot;Earth Science&quot;, &quot;Engineering&quot; and &quot;Materials Science&quot; were rewarded.

Additionally since 1990, the Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science (Bower Science Award) and the Bower Award for Business Leadership have been awarded annually. They are funded by a $7.5 million bequest in 1988 from Henry Bower, a chemical manufacturer in Philadelphia. The Bower Science Award contains $250,000 of cash, one of the largest amounts for a science award in the US.

The institute&#x27;s Committee on Science and the Arts determines the winners of these awards. Recipients and related information can be found in the laureates database.

==Informal science learning research==

The Franklin Institute also undertakes research in informal science education. Areas of special strength are educational technology, school partnerships, and youth leadership. In addition, the center has built a substantial portfolio of unique online resources of the history of science, including online exhibits on Ben Franklin and the Heart, as well as resources on the Wright Aeronautical Engineering Collection.
The Franklin Institute is a member of the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE Net).

==Programs==
===Science Leadership Academy===

Opening in September 2006, The &quot;Science Leadership Academy&quot; is a partnership between the Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia.

===Teacher professional development===
The Franklin Institute offers summer institutes and school year mini-courses for K-8 teachers, in collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia and Curriculum &amp; Instruction Office.

===Partnerships for Achieving Careers in Technology and Science===
&quot;Partnerships for Achieving Careers in Technology and Science&quot;, or PACTS, is a year-round program of science enrichment, career development, and leadership opportunities for diverse middle- and high-school students in the Philadelphia Region. PACTS students use hands-on science workshops, field based research, field trips, and laboratory experiments to learn how science affects their everyday lives.

===Girls at the Center===
&quot;Girls at the Center&quot; is a partnership between the Franklin Institute and the Girl Scouts of the USA provided girls and their families a chance to learn about science together. Over 100 sites participated in the program, with over 70 of the sites still active today. Girls at the Center provided activities for the girls to do with their families at home, as well as projects to be completed on site, all culminating in a year-end party.

<text>The Westerwaldkreis (&quot;District of Westerwald&quot;) is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the north-east of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Neighbouring districts are (from north clockwise) Altenkirchen, Lahn-Dill, Limburg-Weilburg, Rhein-Lahn, the district-free city Koblenz, Mayen-Koblenz and Neuwied.

==History==
When the area became part of Prussia in 1866 two districts covering the area were created. The northern part was covered by the Oberwesterwaldkreis with capital in Marienberg, the Unterwesterwaldkreis with capital in Montabaur covering the southern part. In 1886 a third district was added with the Westerburg district with area from both of the other two districts. In 1932 the districts structure was reformed again, the Oberwesterwaldkreis and the Westerburg district were merged to a new Oberwesterwaldkreis with capital in Westerburg. In 1974 in another reform the districts Oberwesterwaldkreis and Unterwesterwaldkreis were merged to form the Westerwaldkreis.

Together with the neighboring Rhein-Lahn district a partnership with the English county Northamptonshire was started in 1981. As part of the partnership of Rhineland-Palatinate with Rwanda the district had a partnership with the municipality Mugesera since 1983. As in 2001 this municipality was included in the district Mirenge the partner changed.

==Geography==
The district is located in the Westerwald mountains. Its highest elevation is the Fuchskaute, at 657 m, the lowest is near Diez in the valley of the Gelbach, at 150 m.

==Coat of arms==
The bottom part of the coat of arms show basalt pillars, as the Westerwald is of volcanic origin. There are seven pillars representing the seven &quot;Verbandsgemeinden&quot; of the district which have basalt or quartzite in their area. The green band in the middle represents the forests, the jug in the upper part the traditional pottery industry in the district.

<text>Organization development (OD) is the study and implementation of practices, systems, and techniques that affect organizational change. The goal of which is to modify a group&#x27;s/organization&#x27;s performance and/or culture. The organizational changes are typically initiated by the group&#x27;s stakeholders. OD emerged from human relations studies in the 1930s, during which psychologists realized that organizational structures and processes influence worker behavior and motivation. 

Organization Development allows businesses to construct and maintain a brand new preferred state for the whole agency. Key concepts of OD theory include: organizational climate (the mood or unique &quot;personality&quot; of an organization, which includes attitudes and beliefs that influence members&#x27; collective behavior), organizational culture (the deeply-seated norms, values, and behaviors that members share) and organizational strategies (how an organization identifies problems, plans action, negotiates change and evaluates progress). A key aspect of OD is to review organizational identity.

== Overview ==
Organization development as a practice involves an ongoing, systematic process of implementing effective organizational change. OD is both a field of applied science focused on understanding and managing organizational change and a field of scientific study and inquiry. It is interdisciplinary in nature and draws on sociology, psychology, particularly industrial and organizational psychology, and theories of motivation, learning, and personality. Although behavioral science has provided the basic foundation for the study and practice of OD, new and emerging fields of study have made their presence felt. Experts in systems thinking, in organizational learning, in the structure of intuition in decision-making, and in coaching (to name a few) whose perspective is not steeped in just the behavioral sciences, but in a much more multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary approach, have emerged as OD catalysts or tools.

===History===
Kurt Lewin (1898–1947) is the founding father of OD, although he died before the concept became mainstream in the mid-1950s. From Lewin came the ideas of group dynamics and action research which underpin the basic OD process as well as providing its collaborative consultant/client ethos. Institutionally, Lewin founded the &quot;Research Center for Group Dynamics&quot; (RCGD) at MIT, which moved to Michigan after his death. RCGD colleagues were among those who founded the National Training Laboratories (NTL), from which the T-groups and group-based OD emerged.

Kurt Lewin played a key role in the evolution of organization development as it is known today. As early as World War II (1939-1945), Lewin experimented with a collaborative change-process (involving himself as a consultant and a client group) based on a three-step process of planning, taking action, and measuring results. This was the forerunner of action research, an important element of OD, which will be discussed later. Lewin also initiated a learning method known as laboratory training, or T-groups. After Lewin&#x27;s death in 1947, his close associates helped to develop survey-research methods at the University of Michigan. These procedures became important parts of OD as developments in this field continued at the National Training Laboratories and in growing numbers of universities and private consulting-firms across the US. Leading universities offering doctoral-level degrees in OD include Benedictine University and the Fielding Graduate University.

Douglas and Richard Beckhard, while &quot;consulting together at General Mills in the 1950s [...] coined the term &quot;organization development&quot; (OD) to describe an innovative bottom-up change effort that fit no traditional consulting categories&quot; (Weisbord, 1987, p. 112).

The failure of off-site laboratory training to live up to its early promise was one of the important forces stimulating the development of OD. Laboratory training is learning from a person&#x27;s &quot;here and now&quot; experience as a member of an ongoing training group. Such groups usually meet without a specific agenda. Their purpose is for the members to learn about themselves from their spontaneous &quot;here and now&quot; responses to an ambiguous situation. Problems of leadership, structure, status, communication, and self-serving behavior typically arise in such a group. The members have an opportunity to learn something about themselves and to practice such skills as listening, observing others, and functioning as effective group members. Herbert A. Shepard conducted the first large-scale experiments in Organization Development in the late fifties. He also founded the first doctoral program in organizational behavior at Case Western State University, and his colleague, Robert Blake, was also influential in making the term &quot;organizational development&quot; a more widely recognized field of psychological research. 

As formerly practiced (and occasionally still practiced for special purposes), laboratory training was conducted in &quot;stranger groups&quot;—groups composed of individuals from different organizations, situations, and backgrounds. A major difficulty developed, however, in transferring knowledge gained from these &quot;stranger labs&quot; to the actual situation &quot;back home&quot;. This required a transfer between two different cultures, the relatively safe and protected environment of the T-group (or training group), and the give-and-take of the organizational environment with its traditional values. This led the early pioneers in this type of learning to begin to apply it to &quot;family groups&quot;—that is, groups located within an organization. From this shift in the locale of the training site and the realization that culture was an important factor in influencing group members (along with some other developments in the behavioral sciences) emerged the concept of organization development.

===Core values===

Underlying Organization Development are humanistic values. Margulies and Raia (1972) articulated the humanistic values of OD as follows:

# providing opportunities for people to function as human beings rather than as resources in the productive process
# providing opportunities for each organization member, as well as for the organization itself, to develop to their full potential
# seeking to increase the effectiveness of the organization in terms of all of its goals
# attempting to create an environment in which it is possible to find exciting and challenging work
# providing opportunities for people in organizations to influence the way in which they relate to work, the organization, and the environment
# treating each human being as a person with a complex set of needs, all of which are important to their work and their life

This is a separate concept from change efforts known as:
# Operation management
# Training and development
# Technological innovations...etc.

==== Objectives ====
The objectives of OD are:

# to increase the level of inter-personal trust among employees
# to increase employees&#x27; level of satisfaction and commitment
# to confront problems instead of neglecting them
# to effectively manage conflict
# to increase cooperation and collaboration among employees
# to increase organizational problem-solving
# to put in place processes that will help improve the ongoing operation of an organization on a continuous basis

As objectives of organizational development are framed keeping in view specific situations, they vary from one situation to another. In other words, these programs are tailored to meet the requirements of a particular situation. But broadly speaking, all organizational development programs try to achieve the following objectives:

# making individuals in the organization aware of the vision of the organization. Organizational development helps in making employees align with the vision of the organization
# encouraging employees to solve problems instead of avoiding them
# strengthening inter-personal trust, cooperation, and communication for the successful achievement of organizational goals
# encouraging every individual to participate in the process of planning, thus making them feel responsible for the implementation of the plan
# creating a work atmosphere in which employees are encouraged to work and participate enthusiastically
# replacing formal lines of authority with personal knowledge and skill
# preparing members to align with changes and to break stereotypes 
# creating an environment of trust so that employees willingly accept change

According to organizational-development thinking, organization development provides managers with a vehicle for introducing change systematically by applying a broad selection of management techniques. This, in turn, leads to greater personal, group, and organizational effectiveness.

===Change agent===
A change agent in the sense used here is not a technical expert skilled in such functional areas as accounting, production, or finance. The change agent is a behavioral scientist who knows how to get people in an organization involved in solving their own problems. A change agent&#x27;s main strength is a comprehensive knowledge of human behavior, supported by a number of intervention techniques (to be discussed later). The change agent can be either external or internal to the organization. An internal change agent is usually a staff person who has expertise in the behavioral sciences and in the intervention technology of OD. Beckhard reports several cases in which line people have been trained in OD and have returned to their organizations to engage in successful change-assignments.

Researchers at the University of Oxford found that leaders can be effective change-agents within their own organizations if they are strongly committed to &quot;knowledge leadership&quot; targeted towards organizational development. In their three-year study of UK healthcare organizations, the researchers identified three different mechanisms through which knowledge leaders actively &quot;transposed&quot;, &quot;appropriated&quot; or &quot;contended&quot; change concepts, effectively translating and embedding these in organizational practice.

The change agent may be a staff or line member of the organization who is schooled in OD theory and technique. In such a case, the &quot;contractual relationship&quot; is an in-house agreement that should probably be explicit with respect to all of the conditions involved except the fee.

===Sponsoring organization===
The initiative for OD programs often comes from an organization that has a problem or anticipates facing a problem. This means that top management or someone authorized by top management is aware that a problem exists and has decided to seek help in solving it. There is a direct analogy here to the practice of psychotherapy: The client or patient must actively seek help in finding a solution to his problems. This indicates a willingness on the part of the client organization to accept help and assures the organization that management is actively concerned.

===Applied behavioral science===

One of the outstanding characteristics of OD that distinguishes it from most other improvement programs is that it is based on a &quot;helping relationship&quot;. Some believe that the change agent is a physician to the organization&#x27;s ills; that s/he does not examine the &quot;patient&quot;, make a diagnosis, and write a prescription. Nor does s/he try to teach organizational members a new inventory of knowledge which they then transfer to the job situation. Using theory and methods drawn from such behavioral sciences as industrial/organizational psychology, industrial sociology, communication, cultural anthropology, administrative theory, organizational behavior, economics, and political science, the change agent&#x27;s main function is to help the organization define and solve its own problems. The basic method used is known as action research. This approach, which is described in detail later, consists of a preliminary diagnosis, collecting data, feedback of the data to the client, data exploration by the client group, action planning based on the data, and taking action.

===Systems context===

===The holistic and futuristic view of organization===
OD deals with a total system—the organization as a whole, including its relevant environment—or with a subsystem or systems—departments or workgroups—in the context of the total system. Parts of systems—for example, individuals, cliques, structures, norms, values, and products—are not considered in isolation; the principle of interdependency—that change in one part of a system affects the other parts—is fully recognized. Thus OD interventions focus on the total cultures and cultural processes of organizations. The focus is also on groups, since the relevant behavior of individuals in organizations and groups is generally a product of the influences of groups rather than of personalities.

==Improved organizational performance==
The objective of OD is to improve the organization&#x27;s capacity to handle its internal and external functioning and relationships. This includes improved interpersonal and group processes, more effective communication, and enhanced ability to cope with organizational problems of all kinds. It also involves more effective decision processes, more appropriate leadership styles, improved skill in dealing with destructive conflict, as well as developing improved levels of trust and cooperation among organizational members. These objectives stem from a value system based on an optimistic view of the nature of man—that man in a supportive environment is capable of achieving higher levels of development and accomplishment. Essential to organization development and effectiveness is the scientific method—inquiry, a rigorous search for causes, experimental testing of hypotheses, and review of results.

&quot;Self-managing&quot; workgroups allow the members of a work team to manage, control, and monitor all facets of their work, from recruiting, hiring, and new employees to deciding when to take rest breaks. An early analysis of the first-self-managing work groups yielded the following behavioral characteristics (Hackman, 1986):

*Employees assume personal responsibility and accountability for the outcomes of their work.
*Employees monitor their own performance and seek feedback on how well they are accomplishing their goals.
*Employees manage their performance and take corrective action when necessary to improve their and the performance of other group members.
*Employees seek guidance, assistance, and resources from the organization when they do not have what they need to do the job.
*Employees help members of their workgroup and employees in other groups to improve job performance and raise productivity for the organization as a whole.

===Organizational self-renewal===
The ultimate aim of OD practitioners is to &quot;work themselves out of a job&quot; by leaving the client organization with a set of tools, behaviors, attitudes, and an action plan with which to monitor its own state of health and to take corrective steps toward its own renewal and development. This is consistent with the systems concept of feedback as a regulatory and corrective mechanism. To this end, OD scholars and practitioners use tools such as simulations with their clients, to be used in workshops and classroom settings. One example of a self-renewal simulation, authored by researchers from Cornell University and Indiana University, can be found here (see citation).

The study of organizational effectiveness and improving organizational performance has developed alongside the study of leadership development with a greater focus on leadership development programs that focus on the development of the individual. See .Emotional intelligence in relation to leadership development.

== Understanding organizations ==
Weisbord presents a six-box model for understanding organizations:

#Purposes: The organization members are clear about the organization&#x27;s mission and purpose and goal agreements, whether people support the organization&#x27;s purpose.
#Structure: How is the organization&#x27;s work divided up? The question is whether there is an adequate fit between the purpose and the internal structure.
#Relationship: Between individuals, between units or departments that perform different tasks, and between the people and requirements of their jobs.
#Rewards: The consultant should diagnose the similarities between what the organization formally rewarded or punished members for.
#Leadership: Is to watch for blips among the other boxes and maintain balance among them.
#Helpful mechanism: What must the organization attend to in order to survive and thrive—procedures such as planning, control, budgeting, and other information systems.
===Modern development===
In recent years, serious questioning has emerged about the relevance of OD to managing change in modern organizations. The need for &quot;reinventing&quot; the field has become a topic that even some of its &quot;founding fathers&quot; are discussing critically.

With this call for reinvention and change, scholars have begun to examine organizational development from an emotion-based standpoint. For example, deKlerk (2007) writes about how emotional trauma can negatively affect performance. Due to downsizing, outsourcing, mergers, restructuring, continual changes, invasions of privacy, harassment, and abuses of power, many employees experience the emotions of aggression, anxiety, apprehension, cynicism, and fear, which can lead to performance decreases. de Klerk (2007) suggests that in order to heal the trauma and increase performance, O.D. practitioners must acknowledge the existence of the trauma, provide a safe place for employees to discuss their feelings, symbolize the trauma and put it into perspective, and then allow for and deal with the emotional responses. One method of achieving this is by having employees draw pictures of what they feel about the situation, and then having them explain their drawings with each other. Drawing pictures is beneficial because it allows employees to express emotions they normally would not be able to put into words. Also, drawings often prompt active participation in the activity, as everyone is required to draw a picture and then discuss its meaning...

The use of new technologies combined with globalization has also shifted the field of organizational development. Roland Sullivan (2005) defined Organization Development with participants at the 1st Organization Development Conference for Asia in Dubai-2005 as &quot;Organization Development is a transformative leap to a desired vision where strategies and systems align, in the light of local culture with an innovative and authentic leadership style using the support of high tech tools. Bob Aubrey (2015) introduced Key Development Indicators to help organizations go beyond performance and align strategy, organizations, and individuals and argued that fundamental challenges such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and genetics prefigure a regeneration of the field.

==Action research==
Wendell L French and Cecil Bell defined organization development (OD) at one point as &quot;organization improvement through action research&quot;. If one idea can be said to summarize OD&#x27;s underlying philosophy, it would be action research as it was conceptualized by Kurt Lewin and later elaborated and expanded on by other behavioral scientists. Concerned with social change and, more particularly, with effective, permanent social change, Lewin believed that the motivation to change was strongly related to action: If people are active in decisions affecting them, they are more likely to adopt new ways. &quot;Rational social management&quot;, he said, &quot;proceeds in a spiral of steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action, and fact-finding about the result of action&quot;.
Lewin&#x27;s description of the process of change involves three steps:

&quot;Unfreezing&quot;: Faced with a dilemma or disconfirmation, the individual or group becomes aware of a need to change.

&quot;Changing&quot;: The situation is diagnosed and new models of behavior are explored and tested.

&quot;Refreezing&quot;: Application of new behavior is evaluated, and if reinforced, adopted.

&quot;Figure 1&quot; summarizes the steps and processes involved in planned change through action research. Action research is depicted as a cyclical process of change. The cycle begins with a series of planning actions initiated by the client and the change agent working together. The principal elements of this stage include a preliminary diagnosis, data gathering, feedback of results, and joint action planning. In the language of systems theory, this is the input phase, in which the client system becomes aware of problems as yet unidentified, realizes it may need outside help to effect changes, and shares with the consultant the process of problem diagnosis.

The second stage of action research is the action, or transformation, phase. This stage includes actions relating to learning processes (perhaps in the form of role analysis) and to planning and executing behavioral changes in the client organization. As shown in Figure 1, feedback at this stage would move via Feedback Loop A and would have the effect of altering previous planning to bring the learning activities of the client system into better alignment with change objectives. Included in this stage is action-planning activity carried out jointly by the consultant and members of the client system. Following the workshop or learning sessions, these action steps are carried out on the job as part of the transformation stage.

The third stage of action research is the output, or results, phase. This stage includes actual changes in behavior (if any) resulting from corrective action steps taken following the second stage. Data are again gathered from the client system so that progress can be determined and necessary adjustments in learning activities can be made. Minor adjustments of this nature can be made in learning activities via Feedback Loop B (see &quot;Figure 1&quot;). Major adjustments and reevaluations would return the OD project to the first, or planning, a stage for basic changes in the program. The action-research model shown in &quot;Figure 1&quot; closely follows Lewin&#x27;s repetitive cycle of planning, action, and measuring results. It also illustrates other aspects of Lewin&#x27;s general model of change. As indicated in the diagram, the planning stage is a period of unfreezing, or problem awareness. The action stage is a period of change, that is, trying out new forms of behavior in an effort to understand and cope with the system&#x27;s problems. (There is inevitable overlap between the stages since the boundaries are not clear-cut and cannot be in a continuous process). The results stage is a period of refreezing, in which new behaviors are tried out on the job and, if successful and reinforcing, become a part of the system&#x27;s repertoire of problem-solving behavior.

Action research is problem-centered, client-centered, and action-oriented. It involves the client system in a diagnostic, active-learning, problem-finding, and problem-solving process. Data are not simply returned in the form of a written report but instead are fed back in open joint sessions, and the client and the change agent collaborate in identifying and ranking specific problems, in devising methods for finding their real causes, and in developing plans for coping with them realistically and practically. Scientific method in the form of data gathering, forming hypotheses, testing hypotheses, and measuring results, although not pursued as rigorously as in the laboratory, is nevertheless an integral part of the process. Action research also sets in motion a long-range, cyclical, self-correcting mechanism for maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of the client&#x27;s system by leaving the system with practical and useful tools for self-analysis and self-renewal.

==Interventions==
&quot;Interventions&quot; are principal learning processes in the &quot;action&quot; stage (see &quot;Figure 1&quot;) of organization development. Interventions are structured activities used individually or in combination by the members of a client system to improve their social or task performance. They may be introduced by a change agent as part of an improvement program, or they may be used by the client following a program to check on the state of the organization&#x27;s health or to effect necessary changes in its own behavior. &quot;Structured activities&quot; mean such diverse procedures as experiential exercises, questionnaires, attitude surveys, interviews, relevant group discussions, and even lunchtime meetings between the change agent and a member of the client organization. Every action that influences an organization&#x27;s improvement program in a change agent-client system relationship can be said to be an intervention. The change agent may opt for setting up an episodic intervention organization within the client organization as part of the OD action plan.

There are many possible intervention strategies from which to choose. Several assumptions about the nature and functioning of organizations are made in the choice of a particular strategy. Beckhard lists six such assumptions:

# The basic building blocks of an organization are groups (teams). Therefore, the basic units of change are groups, not individuals.
# An always relevant change goal is the reduction of inappropriate competition between parts of the organization and the development of a more collaborative condition.
# Decision making in a healthy organization is located where the information sources are, rather than in a particular role or level of hierarchy.
# Organizations, subunits of organizations, and individuals continuously manage their affairs against goals. Controls are interim measurements, not the basis of managerial strategy.
# One goal of a healthy organization is to develop generally open communication, mutual trust, and confidence between and across levels.
# People support what they help create. People affected by a change must be allowed active participation and a sense of ownership in the planning and conduct of the change.

Interventions range from those designed to improve the effectiveness of individuals through those designed to deal with teams and groups, intergroup relations, and the total organization. There are interventions that focus on task issues (what people do), and those that focus on process issues (how people go about doing it). Finally, interventions may be roughly classified according to which change mechanism they tend to emphasize: for example, feedback, awareness of changing cultural norms, interaction and communication, conflict, and education through either new knowledge or skill practice.

One of the most difficult tasks confronting the change agent is to help create in the client system a safe climate for learning and change. In a favorable climate, human learning builds on itself and continues indefinitely during man&#x27;s lifetime. Out of new behavior, new dilemmas and problems emerge as the spiral continues upward to new levels. In an unfavorable climate, in contrast, learning is far less certain, and in an atmosphere of psychological threat, it often stops altogether. Unfreezing old ways can be inhibited in organizations because the climate makes employees feel that it is inappropriate to reveal true feelings, even though such revelations could be constructive. In an inhibited atmosphere, therefore, necessary feedback is not available. Also, trying out new ways may be viewed as risky because it violates established norms. Such an organization may also be constrained because of the law of systems: If one part changes, other parts will become involved. Hence, it is easier to maintain the status quo. Hierarchical authority, specialization, span of control, and other characteristics of formal systems also discourage experimentation.

The change agent is to be prepared for having to address all of the above hazards and obstacles. Some of the things which will help the change agent are:
# A real need in the client system to change
# Genuine support from management
# Setting a personal example: listening, supporting behavior
# A sound background in the behavioral sciences
# A working knowledge of systems theory
# A belief in man as a rational, self-educating being fully capable of learning better ways to do things.

A few examples of interventions include team building, coaching, Large Group Interventions, mentoring, performance appraisal, downsizing, TQM, and leadership development.

<doc id="226597" wikidata="Q791974" url="?curid=226597" title="Mutual fund">
<text>A mutual fund is an investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities. The term is typically used in the United States, Canada, and India, while similar structures across the globe include the SICAV in Europe (&#x27;investment company with variable capital&#x27;), and the open-ended investment company (OEIC) in the UK.

Mutual funds are often classified by their principal investments: money market funds, bond or fixed income funds, stock or equity funds, or hybrid funds. Funds may also be categorized as index funds, which are passively managed funds that track the performance of an index, such as a stock market index or bond market index, or actively managed funds, which seek to outperform stock market indices but generally charge higher fees. The primary structures of mutual funds are open-end funds, closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts. Over long durations, passively managed funds consistently outperform actively managed funds. 

Open-end funds are purchased from or sold to the issuer at the net asset value of each share as of the close of the trading day in which the order was placed, as long as the order was placed within a specified period before the close of trading. They can be traded directly with the issuer.

Mutual funds have advantages and disadvantages compared to direct investing in individual securities. The advantages of mutual funds include economies of scale, diversification, liquidity, and professional management. As with other types of investment, investing in mutual funds involves various fees and expenses.

Mutual funds are regulated by governmental bodies and are required to publish information including performance, comparisons of performance to benchmarks, fees charged, and securities held. A single mutual fund may have several share classes, for which larger investors pay lower fees.

Hedge funds and exchange-traded funds are not typically referred to as mutual funds, and each is targeted at different investors, with hedge funds being available only to high-net-worth individuals.

==Market size==
At the end of 2020, open-end mutual fund assets worldwide were $63.1 trillion. The countries with the largest mutual fund industries are:
# United States: $23.9 trillion
# Australia: $5.3 trillion
# Ireland: $3.4 trillion
# Germany: $2.5 trillion
# Luxembourg: $2.2 trillion
# France: $2.2 trillion
# Japan: $2.1 trillion
# Canada: $1.9 trillion
# United Kingdom: $1.9 trillion
# China: $1.4 trillion

At the end of 2019, 23% of household financial assets were invested in mutual funds. Mutual funds accounted for approximately 50% of the assets in individual retirement accounts, 401(k)s and other similar retirement plans.

Luxembourg and Ireland are the primary jurisdictions for the registration of UCITS funds. These funds may be sold throughout the European Union and in other countries that have adopted mutual recognition regimes.

==History==
=== Early history ===
The first modern investment funds, the precursor of mutual funds, were established in the Dutch Republic. In response to the financial crisis of 1772–1773, Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham (or Adriaan) van Ketwich formed a trust named Eendragt Maakt Magt (&quot;unity creates strength&quot;). His aim was to provide small investors with an opportunity to diversify.

The first investment trust in the UK, the Scottish American Investment Trust formed in 1873, is considered the &quot;most obvious progenitor&quot; to the mutual fund, according to Diana B. Henriques.

One of the earliest investment companies in the U.S. similar to a modern mutual fund was the Boston Personal Property Trust that was founded in 1893; however, its original intent was as a workaround to Massachusetts law restricting corporate real estate holdings rather than investing. Early U.S. funds were generally closed-end funds with a fixed number of shares that often traded at prices above the portfolio net asset value. The first open-end mutual fund with redeemable shares was established on March 21, 1924, as the Massachusetts Investors Trust, which is still in existence today and managed by MFS Investment Management.

In the U.S., there were nearly six times as many closed-end funds as mutual funds in 1929.

After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the United States Congress passed a series of acts regulating the securities markets in general and mutual funds in particular. 
* The Securities Act of 1933 requires that all investments sold to the public, including mutual funds, be registered with the SEC and that they provide prospective investors with a prospectus that discloses essential facts about the investment. 
* The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that issuers of securities, including mutual funds, report regularly to their investors. This act also created the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the principal regulator of mutual funds. 
* The Revenue Act of 1936 established guidelines for the taxation of mutual funds. It allowed mutual funds to be treated as a flow-through or pass-through entity, where income is passed through to investors who are responsible for the tax on that income.
* The Investment Company Act of 1940 established rules specifically governing mutual funds. 
These new regulations encouraged the development of open-end mutual funds (as opposed to closed-end funds).

In 1936, U.S. mutual fund industry was nearly half as large as closed-end investment trusts. But mutual funds had grown to twice as large as closed-end funds by 1947; growth would accelerate to ten times as much by 1959. In terms of dollar amounts, mutual funds in the U.S. totaled $2 billion in value in 1950 and about $17 billion in 1960. The introduction of money market funds in the high-interest rate environment of the late 1970s boosted industry growth dramatically. 

The first retail index funds appeared in the early 1970s, aiming to capture average market returns rather than doing detailed company-by-company analysis as earlier funds had done. Rex Sinquefield offered the first S&amp;P 500 index fund to the general public starting in 1973, while employed at American National Bank of Chicago. Sinquefield&#x27;s fund had $12 billion in assets after its first seven years. John &quot;Mac&quot; McQuown also began an index fund in 1973, though it was part of a large pension fund managed by Wells Fargo and not open to the general public. Batterymarch Financial, a small Boston firm then employing Jeremy Grantham, also offered index funds beginning in 1973 but it was such a revolutionary concept they did not have paying customers for over a year. John Bogle was another early pioneer of index funds with the First Index Investment Trust, formed in 1976 by The Vanguard Group; it is now called the &quot;Vanguard 500 Index Fund&quot; and is one of the largest mutual funds.

Beginning the 1980s, the mutual fund industry began a period of growth. According to Robert Pozen and Theresa Hamacher, growth was the result of three factors:
# A bull market for both stocks and bonds, 
# New product introductions (including funds based on municipal bonds, various industry sectors, international funds, and target date funds) and 
# Wider distribution of fund shares. Among the new distribution channels were retirement plans. Mutual funds are now the a preferred investment option in certain types of retirement plans, specifically in 401(k), other defined contribution plans and in individual retirement accounts (IRAs), all of which surged in popularity in the 1980s.

The 2003 mutual fund scandal involved unequal treatment of fund shareholders whereby some fund management companies allowed favored investors to engage in prohibited late trading or market timing. The scandal was uncovered by former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and led to an increase in regulation.

In a 2007 study about German mutual funds, Johannes Gomolka and Ralf Jasny found statistical evidence of illegal time zone arbitrage in trading of German mutual funds. Though reported to regulators, BaFin never commented on these results.

==Features==
Like other types of investment funds, mutual funds have advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative structures or investing directly in individual securities. According to Robert Pozen and Theresa Hamacher, these are:

===Advantages===
* Increased opportunity for diversification: A fund diversifies by holding many securities. This diversification decreases risk.
* Daily liquidity: In the United States, mutual fund shares can be redeemed for their net asset value within seven days, but in practice the redemption is often much quicker. This liquidity can create asset–liability mismatch which poses challenges, which in part motivated an SEC liquidity management rule in 2016.
* Professional investment management: Open-and closed-end funds hire portfolio managers to supervise the fund&#x27;s investments. 
* Ability to participate in investments that may be available only to larger investors. For example, individual investors often find it difficult to invest directly in foreign markets. 
* Service and convenience: Funds often provide services such as check writing.
* Government oversight: Mutual funds are regulated by a governmental body
* Transparency and ease of comparison: All mutual funds are required to report the same information to investors, which makes them easier to compare to each other.

===Disadvantages===
Mutual funds have disadvantages as well, which include:
* Fees
* Less control over the timing of recognition of gains
* Less predictable income
* No opportunity to customize

==Regulation and operation==
===United States===
In the United States, the principal laws governing mutual funds are:
* The Securities Act of 1933 requires that all investments sold to the public, including mutual funds, be registered with the SEC and that they provide potential investors with a prospectus that discloses essential facts about the investment. 
* The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that issuers of securities, including mutual funds, report regularly to their investors; this act also created the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the principal regulator of mutual funds. 
* The Revenue Act of 1936 established guidelines for the taxation of mutual funds. Mutual funds are not taxed on their income and profits if they comply with certain requirements under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; instead, the taxable income is passed through to the investors in the fund. Funds are required by the IRS to diversify their investments, limit ownership of voting securities, distribute most of their income (dividends, interest, and capital gains net of losses) to their investors annually, and earn most of the income by investing in securities and currencies. The characterization of a fund&#x27;s income is unchanged when it is paid to shareholders. For example, when a mutual fund distributes dividend income to its shareholders, fund investors will report the distribution as dividend income on their tax return. As a result, mutual funds are often called flow-through or pass-through vehicles, because they simply pass on income and related tax liabilities to their investors.
* The Investment Company Act of 1940 establishes rules specifically governing mutual funds. The focus of this Act is on disclosure to the investing public of information about the fund and its investment objectives, as well as on investment company structure and operations.
* The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 establishes rules governing the investment advisers. With certain exceptions, this Act requires that firms or sole practitioners compensated for advising others about securities investments must register with the SEC and conform to regulations designed to protect investors.
* The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 gave rulemaking authority to the federal government, preempting state regulators. However, states continue to have the authority to investigate and prosecute fraud involving mutual funds.

Mutual funds are overseen by a board of directors if organized as a corporation, or by a board of trustees, if organized as a trust. The Board must ensure that the fund is managed in the interests of the fund&#x27;s investors. The board hires the fund manager and other service providers to the fund.

The sponsor or fund management company often referred to as the fund manager, trades (buys and sells) the fund&#x27;s investments in accordance with the fund&#x27;s investment objective. Funds that are managed by the same company under the same brand are known as a fund family or fund complex. A fund manager must be a registered investment adviser.

===European Union===
In the European Union, funds are governed by laws and regulations established by their home country. However, the European Union has established a mutual recognition regime that allows funds regulated in one country to be sold in all other countries in the European Union, if they comply with certain requirements. The directive establishing this regime is the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009, and funds that comply with its requirements are known as UCITS funds.

===Canada===
Regulation of mutual funds in Canada is primarily governed by National Instrument 81-102 &quot;Mutual Funds&quot;, which is implemented separately in each province or territory. The Canadian Securities Administrator works to harmonize regulation across Canada.

===Hong Kong===
In the Hong Kong market mutual funds are regulated by two authorities:
* The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) develops rules that apply to all mutual funds marketed in Hong Kong.
* The Mandatory Provident Funds Schemes Authority (MPFA) rules apply only to mutual funds that are marketed for use in the retirement accounts of Hong Kong residents. The MPFA rules are generally more restrictive than the SFC rules.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, mutual funds are regulated by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).

===India===
Mutual funds in India are regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India, the regulator of the securities and commodity market owned by the Government of India, under the SEBI (Mutual Funds) regulations of 1996. The functional aspect of Mutual Funds industry comes under the purview of AMFI, a trade association of all fund houses. Formed in August 1995, the body undertook the Mutual Funds Sahi hai campaign in March 2017 for promoting investor awareness on mutual funds in India.

==Fund structures==
There are three primary structures of mutual funds: open-end funds, unit investment trusts, and closed-end funds. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are open-end funds or unit investment trusts that trade on an exchange.

===Open-end funds===
Open-end mutual funds must be willing to buy back (&quot;redeem&quot;) their shares from their investors at the net asset value (NAV) computed that day based upon the prices of the securities owned by the fund. In the United States, open-end funds must be willing to buy back shares at the end of every business day. In other jurisdictions, open-end funds may only be required to buy back shares at longer intervals. For example, UCITS funds in Europe are only required to accept redemptions twice each month (though most UCITS accept redemptions daily).

Most open-end funds also sell shares to the public every business day; these shares are priced at NAV.

Open-end funds are often referred to simply as &quot;mutual funds&quot;.

In the United States at the end of 2019, there were 7,945 open-end mutual funds with combined assets of $21.3 trillion, accounting for 83% of the U.S. industry.

===Unit investment trusts===
Unit investment trusts (UITs) are issued to the public only once when they are created. UITs generally have a limited life span, established at creation. Investors can redeem shares directly with the fund at any time (similar to an open-end fund) or wait to redeem them upon the trust&#x27;s termination. Less commonly, they can sell their shares in the open market.

Unlike other types of mutual funds, unit investment trusts do not have a professional investment manager. Their portfolio of securities is established at the creation of the UIT.

In the United States, at the end of 2019, there were 4,571 UITs with combined assets of less than $0.1 trillion.

===Closed-end funds===

Closed-end funds generally issue shares to the public only once, when they are created through an initial public offering. Their shares are then publicly listed. Investors who want to sell their shares must sell their shares to another investor in the market; they cannot sell their shares back to the fund. The price that investors receive for their shares may be significantly different from NAV; it may be at a &quot;premium&quot; to NAV (i.e., higher than NAV) or, more commonly, at a &quot;discount&quot; to NAV (i.e., lower than NAV).

In the United States, at the end of 2019, there were 500 closed-end mutual funds with combined assets of $0.28 trillion.

==Classification of funds by types of underlying investments==
Mutual funds may be classified by their principal investments, as described in the prospectus and investment objective. The four main categories of funds are money market funds, bond or fixed-income funds, stock or equity funds, and hybrid funds. Within these categories, funds may be sub-classified by investment objective, investment approach, or specific focus.

The types of securities that a particular fund may invest in are set forth in the fund&#x27;s prospectus, a legal document that describes the fund&#x27;s investment objective, investment approach and permitted investments. The investment objective describes the type of income that the fund seeks. For example, a capital appreciation fund generally looks to earn most of its returns from increases in the prices of the securities it holds, rather than from dividend or interest income. The investment approach describes the criteria that the fund manager uses to select investments for the fund.

Bond, stock, and hybrid funds may be classified as either index (or passively-managed) funds or actively managed funds.

Alternative investments which incorporate advanced techniques such as hedging known as &quot;liquid alternatives&quot;.

===Money market funds===

Money market funds invest in money market instruments, which are fixed income securities with a very short time to maturity and high credit quality. Investors often use money market funds as a substitute for bank savings accounts, though money market funds are not insured by the government, unlike bank savings accounts.

In the United States, money market funds sold to retail investors and those investing in government securities may maintain a stable net asset value of $1 per share, when they comply with certain conditions. Money market funds sold to institutional investors that invest in non-government securities must compute a net asset value based on the value of the securities held in the funds.

In the United States, at the end of 2019, assets in money market funds were $3.6 trillion, representing 14% of the industry.

===Bond funds===

Bond funds invest in fixed income or debt securities. Bond funds can be sub-classified according to:
* The specific types of bonds owned (such as high-yield or junk bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, government bonds or municipal bonds)
* The maturity of the bonds held (i.e., short-, intermediate- or long-term)
* The country of issuance of the bonds (such as the U.S., emerging market or global)
* The tax treatment of the interest received (taxable or tax-exempt)

In the United States, at the end of 2019, assets in bond funds (of all types) were $5.7 trillion, representing 22% of the industry.

===Stock funds===

Stock or equity funds invest in common stocks. Stock funds may focus on a particular area of the stock market, such as 
* Stocks from only a certain industry
* Stocks from a specified country or region
* Stocks of companies experiencing strong &quot;growth&quot;
* Stocks that the portfolio managers deem to be a good &quot;value&quot; relative to the value of the company&#x27;s business
* Stocks paying high dividends that provide &quot;income&quot;
* Stocks within a certain market capitalization range

In the United States, at the end of 2019, assets in stock funds (of all types) were $15.0 trillion, representing 58% of the industry.

Funds which invest in a relatively small number of stocks are known as &quot;focus funds&quot;.

===Hybrid funds===
Hybrid funds invest in both bonds and stocks or in convertible securities. 
Balanced funds, asset allocation funds, convertible bond funds, target date or target-risk funds, and lifecycle or lifestyle funds are all types of hybrid funds. 
The performance of hybrid funds can be explained by a combination of stock factors (e.g., Fama–French three-factor model), bond factors (e.g., excess returns of a Government bond index), option factors (e.g., implied stock-market volatility), and fund factors (e.g., the net supply of convertible bonds). 

Hybrid funds may be structured as fund of funds, meaning that they invest by buying shares in other mutual funds that invest in securities. Many funds of funds invest in affiliated funds (meaning mutual funds managed by the same fund sponsor), although some invest in unaffiliated funds (i.e., managed by other fund sponsors) or some combination of the two.

In the United States, at the end of 2019, assets in hybrid funds were $1.6 trillion, representing 6% of the industry.

===Other funds===
Funds may invest in commodities or other investments.

==Expenses==
Investors in a mutual fund pay the fund&#x27;s expenses. Some of these expenses reduce the value of an investor&#x27;s account; others are paid by the fund and reduce net asset value.

These expenses fall into five categories:

===Management fee===

The management fee is paid by the fund to the management company or sponsor that organizes the fund, provides the portfolio management or investment advisory services, and normally lends its brand name to the fund. The fund manager may also provide other administrative services. The management fee often has breakpoints, which means that it declines in percentage as the invested amount (in either the specific fund or in the fund family as a whole) increases. The fund&#x27;s board reviews the management fee annually. Fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase, but the fund manager or sponsor can agree to waive some or all of the management fees in order to lower the fund&#x27;s expense ratio.

Index funds generally charge a lower management fee than actively-managed funds.

===Distribution charges===
When these expenses are charged separately, distribution charges pay for marketing, distribution of the fund&#x27;s shares, and services to investors. There are three types of distribution charges.

* Front-end load or sales charge. A front-end load or sales charge is a commission paid to a broker by a mutual fund when shares are purchased. It is expressed as a percentage of the total amount invested or the &quot;public offering price&quot;, which equals the net asset value plus the front-end load per share. The front-end load often declines as the amount invested increases, through breakpoints. The front-end load is paid by the investor; it is deducted from the amount invested.
* Back-end load. Some funds have a back-end load, which is paid by the investor when shares are redeemed. If the back-end load declines the longer the investor holds shares, it is called a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). Like the front-end load, the back-end load is paid by the investor; it is deducted from the redemption proceeds.
* Distribution and services fee. Some funds charge an annual fee to compensate the distributor of fund shares for providing ongoing services to fund shareholders. In the United States, this fee is sometimes called a 12b-1 fee, after the SEC rule authorizing it. The distribution and services fee is paid by the fund and reduces net asset value.
Distribution charges generally vary for each share class.

===Securities transaction fees incurred by the fund===
A mutual fund pays expenses related to buying or selling the securities in its portfolio. These expenses may include brokerage commissions. These costs are normally positively correlated with turnover.

===Shareholder transaction fees===
Shareholders may be required to pay fees for certain transactions, such as buying or selling shares of the fund. A fund may charge a fee for maintaining an individual retirement account for an investor.

Some funds charge redemption fees when an investor sells fund shares shortly after buying them (usually defined as within 30, 60, or 90 days of purchase). Redemption fees are computed as a percentage of the sale amount. Shareholder transaction fees are not part of the expense ratio.

===Fund services charges===
A mutual fund may pay for other services including:
* Board of directors or trustees fees and expenses
* Custody fee: paid to a custodian bank for holding the fund&#x27;s portfolio in safekeeping and collecting income owed on the securities
* Fund administration fee: for overseeing all administrative affairs such as preparing financial statements and shareholder reports, SEC filings, monitoring compliance, computing total returns and other performance information, preparing/filing tax returns and all expenses of maintaining compliance with state blue sky laws
* Fund accounting fee: for performing investment or securities accounting services and computing the net asset value (usually every day the New York Stock Exchange is open)
* Professional services fees: legal and auditing fees
* Registration fees: paid to the SEC and state securities regulators
* Shareholder communications expenses: printing and mailing required documents to shareholders such as shareholder reports and prospectuses
* Transfer agent service fees and expenses: for keeping shareholder records, providing statements and tax forms to investors and providing telephone, internet and or other investor support and servicing
* Other/miscellaneous fees

The fund manager or sponsor may agree to subsidize some of these charges.

===Expense ratio===
The expense ratio equals recurring fees and expenses charged to the fund during the year divided by average net assets. The management fee and fund services charges are ordinarily included in the expense ratio. Front-end and back-end loads, securities transaction fees, and shareholder transaction fees are normally excluded.

To facilitate comparisons of expenses, regulators generally require that funds use the same formula to compute the expense ratio and publish the results.

===No-load fund===
In the United States, a fund that calls itself &quot;no-load&quot; cannot charge a front-end load or back-end load under any circumstances and cannot charge a distribution and services fee greater than 0.25% of fund assets.

===Controversy regarding fees and expenses===
Critics of the fund industry argue that the expenses for many mutual funds are too high. They believe that the market for mutual funds is not as competitive as it should be and that there are often many hidden fees so that it can be difficult for investors to understand and minimize the fees that they pay. They argue that the most effective way for investors to raise the returns they earn from mutual funds is to invest in funds with low expense ratios.

Fund managers counter that fees are determined by a highly competitive market and, therefore, reflect the value that investors attribute to the service provided. They also note that fees are clearly disclosed.

==Definitions of key terms==
===Average annual total return===
Mutual funds in the United States are required to report the average annual compounded rates of return for one-, five- and ten-year periods using the following formula:

:&quot;P&quot; × (1+&quot;T&quot;)&quot;n&quot; = &quot;ERV&quot;

Where:

:&quot;P&quot; = a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000
:&quot;T&quot; = average annual total return (as a percentage divided by 100, e.g., 0.05 for a 5% return)
:&quot;n&quot; = number of years
:&quot;ERV&quot; = ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at the beginning of the one-, five-, or ten-year periods at the end of those periods (or fractional portion).

===Net asset value===

A fund&#x27;s net asset value (NAV) equals the current market value of a fund&#x27;s holdings minus the fund&#x27;s liabilities (this figure may also be referred to as the fund&#x27;s &quot;net assets&quot;). It is usually expressed as a per-share amount, computed by dividing net assets by the number of fund shares outstanding. Funds must compute their net asset value according to the rules set forth in their prospectuses. Most compute their NAV at the end of each business day.

Valuing the securities held in a fund&#x27;s portfolio is often the most difficult part of calculating net asset value. The fund&#x27;s board typically oversees security valuation.

===Share classes===
A single mutual fund may give investors a choice of different combinations of front-end loads, back-end loads and distribution and services fee, by offering several different types of shares, known as share classes. All of them invest in the same portfolio of securities, but each has different expenses and, therefore, different net asset values and different performance results. Some of these share classes may be available only to certain types of investors.

Typical share classes for funds sold through brokers or other intermediaries in the United States are:
* Class A shares usually charge a front-end sales load together with a small distribution and services fee.
* Class B shares usually do not have a front-end sales load; rather, they have a high contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) that gradually declines over several years, combined with a high 12b-1 fee. Class B shares usually convert automatically to Class A shares after they have been held for a certain period.
* Class C shares usually have a high distribution and services fee and a modest contingent deferred sales charge that is discontinued after one or two years. Class C shares usually do not convert to another class. They are often called &quot;level load&quot; shares.
* Class I are usually subject to very high minimum investment requirements and are, therefore, known as &quot;institutional&quot; shares. They are no-load shares.
* Class R are usually for use in retirement plans such as 401(k) plans. They typically do not charge loads but do charge a small distribution and services fee.
No-load funds in the United States often have two classes of shares:
* Class I shares do not charge a distribution and services fee
* Class N shares charge a distribution and services fee of no more than 0.25% of fund assets
Neither class of shares typically charges a front-end or back-end load.

===Portfolio turnover===
&quot;Portfolio turnover&quot; is a measure of the volume of a fund&#x27;s securities trading. It is expressed as a percentage of the average market value of the portfolio&#x27;s long-term securities. Turnover is the lesser of a fund&#x27;s purchases or sales during a given year divided by average long-term securities market value for the same period. If the period is less than a year, turnover is generally annualized.

<doc id="226605" wikidata="Q229698" url="?curid=226605" title="3dfx">
<text>3dfx Interactive, Inc. was an American computer hardware company headquartered in San Jose, California, founded in 1994, that specialized in the manufacturing of 3D graphics processing units, and later, video cards. It was a pioneer in the field from the late 1990s to 2000.

The company&#x27;s original product was the Voodoo Graphics, an add-in card that implemented hardware acceleration of 3D graphics. The hardware accelerated only 3D rendering, relying on the PC&#x27;s current video card for 2D support. Despite this limitation, the Voodoo Graphics product and its follow-up, Voodoo2, were popular. It became standard for 3D games to offer support for the company&#x27;s Glide API.

Renewed interest in 3D gaming led to the success of the company&#x27;s products and by the second half of the 1990s products combining a 2D output with 3D performance were appearing. This was accelerated by the introduction of Microsoft&#x27;s Direct3D, which provided a single high-performance API that could be implemented on these cards, seriously eroding the value of Glide. While 3dfx continued to offer high-performance options, the value proposition was no longer compelling.

In the late 1990s 3dfx had an infringement lawsuit which combined with lower sales in the latter years led Nvidia to acquire 3dfx for their engineers, which they acquired around one hundred of. Most of the company&#x27;s assets were acquired by Nvidia Corporation on December 15, 2000, mostly for intellectual property rights. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase by Nvidia and was completed by the first quarter of their fiscal year of 2002. 3dfx ceased supporting their products on February 15, 2001, and filed for bankruptcy on October 15, 2002.

== Company history ==

=== Early products ===

==== First chips ====
The company was founded on August 24, 1994, as 3D/fx, Inc. Ross Smith, Gary Tarolli and Scott Sellers, all former employees of Silicon Graphics Inc. They were soon joined by Gordie Campbell of TechFarm. 3dfx released its first product, the Voodoo Graphics 3D chip, to manufacturing on November 6, 1995. The chip is a VGA 3D accelerator that features rendering methods such as point-sampled texture mapping, Z- and double buffering, Gouraud shading, subpixel correction, alpha compositing, and anti-aliasing. Alongside the chip came 3dfx&#x27;s Glide API, designed to take full advantage of the Voodoo Graphics&#x27; features. The company stated that Glide&#x27;s creation was because it found that no existing APIs at the time could fully utilize the chip&#x27;s capabilities. DirectX 3.0 was deemed to be lacking, and OpenGL was regarded as suitable only for CAD/CAM workstations. The first graphics card to use the chip was Orchid Technology&#x27;s Righteous 3D, released on October 7, 1996. The company manufactured only the chips and some reference boards, and initially did not sell any product to consumers; rather, it acted as an OEM supplier for graphics card companies, which designed, manufactured, marketed, and sold their own graphics cards including the Voodoo chipset.

3dfx gained initial fame in the arcade market. The first arcade machine that 3dfx Voodoo Graphics hardware was used in was a 1996 baseball game featuring a bat controller with motion sensing technology called &quot;ICE Home Run Derby&quot;. Later that year it was featured in more popular titles, such as Atari&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco Rush&quot; and &quot;Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 3D Hockey&quot;. 3dfx also developed MiniGL after id Software&#x27;s John Carmack released a 1997 version of &quot;Quake&quot; that used the OpenGL API. The MiniGL translated OpenGL commands into Glide, and gave 3dfx the advantage as the sole consumer chip company to deliver a functional graphics library driver until 1998.

==== Entry to the consumer market ====

Towards the end of 1995, the cost of DRAM dropped significantly and 3dfx was able to enter the consumer PC hardware market with aggressive pricing compared to the few previous 3D graphics solutions for computers. Prior to affordable 3D hardware, games such as &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot; had compelled video game players to move from their 80386s to 80486s, and then to the Pentium.

By the end of 1997, the Voodoo Graphics was by far the most widely adopted 3D accelerator among both consumers and software developers. The Voodoo&#x27;s primary competition was from PowerVR and Rendition. PowerVR produced a similar 3D-only add-on card with capable 3D support, although it was not comparable to Voodoo Graphics in either image quality or performance. 3dfx saw intense competition in the market from cards that offered the combination of 2D and 3D acceleration. While these cards, such as the Nvidia NV1, Matrox Mystique, S3 ViRGE, Vérité V1000, and ATI 3D Rage, offered inferior 3D acceleration in terms of image quality, performance, or both, their lower cost and simplicity often appealed to OEM system builders.

==== Dreamcast ====
In 1997, 3dfx was working with entertainment company Sega to develop a new video game console hardware platform. Sega solicited two competing designs: a unit code-named &quot;Katana&quot;, developed in Japan using NEC and Imagination Technologies (then VideoLogic) technology, and &quot;Blackbelt&quot;, a system designed in the United States using 3dfx technology.

However, on July 22, 1997, 3dfx announced that Sega was terminating the development contract. Sega chose to use NEC&#x27;s PowerVR chipset for its game console, though it still planned to purchase the rights to 3dfx&#x27;s technology in order to prevent competitors from acquiring it.

3dfx said Sega has still not given a reason as to why it terminated the contract or why it chose NEC&#x27;s accelerator chipset over 3dfx&#x27;s. According to Dale Ford, senior analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm based in San Jose, California, a number of factors could have influenced Sega&#x27;s decision to move to NEC, including NEC&#x27;s proven track record of supplying chipsets for the Nintendo 64 and the demonstrated ability to be able to handle a major influx of capacity if the company decided to ramp up production on a moment&#x27;s notice.

&quot;This is a highly competitive market with price wars happening all the time and it would appear that after evaluating a number of choices—and the ramifications each choice brings—Sega went with a decision that it thought was best for the company&#x27;s longevity,&quot; said Mr. Ford.

&quot;Sega has to make a significant move to stay competitive and they need to make it soon. Now whether this move is to roll out another home console platform or move strictly to the PC gaming space is unknown.&quot;

Sega quickly quashed 3dfx&#x27;s &quot;Blackbelt&quot; and used the NEC-based &quot;Katana&quot; as the model for the product that would be marketed and sold as the Dreamcast. 3dfx sued Sega for breach of contract, accusing Sega of starting the deal in bad faith in order to take 3dfx technology. The case was settled out of court.

=== New chips, competition, and decline ===

==== Development of Rampage ====
In early 1998, 3dfx embarked on a new development project. The Rampage development project was new technology for use in a new graphics card that would take approximately two years to develop, and would supposedly be several years ahead of the competition once it debuted. The company hired hardware and software teams in Austin, Texas, to develop 2D and 3D Windows device drivers for Rampage in the summer of 1998. The hardware team in Austin initially focused on Rampage, but then worked on transform and lighting (T&amp;L) engines and on MPEG decoder technology.

==== Acquisition of STB ====

3dfx announced in January 1999 that their Banshee cards had sold about one million units. While Nvidia had yet to launch a product in the add-in board market that sold as well as 3dfx&#x27;s Voodoo line, the company was gaining steady ground in the OEM market. The Nvidia RIVA TNT was a similar, highly integrated product that had two major advantages in greater 3D speed and 32-bit 3D color support. 3dfx, by contrast, had very limited OEM sales, as the Banshee was adopted only in small numbers by OEMs.

3dfx executed a major strategy change just prior to the launch of Voodoo3 by purchasing STB Systems for US $141 million on December 14, 1998. STB Systems was one of the larger graphics card manufacturers at the time; the intent was for 3dfx to start manufacturing, marketing, and selling its own graphics cards, rather than functioning only as an OEM supplier. Purchase of STB was intended to give 3dfx access to that company&#x27;s considerable OEM resources and sales channels, but the intended benefits of the acquisition never materialized. The two corporations were vastly different entities, with different cultures and structures, and they never integrated smoothly.

STB prior to the 3dfx acquisition also approached Nvidia as a potential partner to acquire the company. At the time, STB was Nvidia&#x27;s largest customer and was only minimally engaged with 3dfx. 3dfx management mistakenly believed that acquiring STB would ensure OEM design wins with their products and that product limitations would be overcome with STB&#x27;s knowledge in supporting the OEM sales/design win cycles. Nvidia decided not to acquire STB and to continue to support many brands of graphics board manufacturers. After STB was acquired by 3dfx, Nvidia focused on being a virtual graphics card manufacturer for the OEMs and strengthened its position in selling finished reference designs ready for market to the OEMs. STB&#x27;s manufacturing facility in Juarez, Mexico was not able to compete from either a cost or quality point of view when compared to the burgeoning original design manufacturers (ODMs) and Contract electronic manufacturers (CEMs) that were delivering solutions in Asia for Nvidia. Prior to the STB merger finalizing, some of 3dfx&#x27;s OEMs warned the company that any product from Juarez will not be deemed fit to ship with their systems, however 3dfx management believed these problems could be addressed over time. Those customers generally became Nvidia customers and no longer chose to ship 3dfx products.

The acquisition of STB was one of the main contributors to 3dfx&#x27;s downfall; the Voodoo 3 became the first 3dfx card to be developed in-house rather than by third-party manufacturers, which were a significant source of revenue for the company. These third-party manufacturers turned into competitors and began sourcing graphics chips from Nvidia. This also further alienated 3dfx&#x27;s remaining OEM customers, as they had a single source for 3dfx products and could not choose an OEM to provide cost flexibility. With the purchase of STB, 3dfx created two cards targeting the low-end market, the Velocity 100, which has 8 MB of SDRAM, and the Velocity 200, which has 16 MB of SGRAM. The cards both used a chipset based on the Voodoo3 2000, and it was claimed that they were &quot;underclocked&quot;. However, it was revealed by testing that the Velocity 100 chipset has the same clock speed as a typical Voodoo3 2000—at 143 MHz—and that, while one of its two TMUs is disabled in OpenGL and Glide applications for memory management, it can be re-enabled to increase those applications&#x27; performance, and &quot;AnandTech&quot; found no side effects of enabling the component.

As 3dfx focused more on the retail graphics card space, further inroads into the OEM space were limited. A significant requirement of the OEM business was the ability to consistently produce new products on the six-month product refresh cycle the computer manufacturers required; 3dfx did not have the methodology nor the mindset to focus on this business model. In the end, 3dfx opted to be a retail distribution company manufacturing their own branded products.

==== Delays ====

The company&#x27;s final product was code-named Napalm. Originally, this was just a Voodoo3 modified to support newer technologies and higher clock speeds, with performance estimated to be around the level of the RIVA TNT2. However, Napalm was delayed, and in the meantime Nvidia brought out their landmark GeForce 256 chip, which shifted even more of the computational work from the CPU to the graphics chip. Napalm would have been unable to compete with the GeForce, so it was redesigned to support multiple chip configurations, like the Voodoo2 had. The end-product was named VSA-100, with VSA standing for Voodoo Scalable Architecture. 3dfx was finally able to have a product that could defeat the GeForce.

However, by the time the VSA-100 based cards made it to the market, the GeForce 2 and ATI Radeon cards had arrived and were offering higher performance for the same price. The only real advantage the Voodoo 5 5500 had over the GeForce 2 GTS or Radeon was its superior spatial anti-aliasing implementation, and the fact that, relative to its peers, it did not suffer such a large performance hit when anti-aliasing was enabled. 3dfx was fully aware of the Voodoo 5&#x27;s speed deficiency, so they touted it as quality over speed, which was a reversal of the Voodoo 3 marketing which emphasized raw performance over features. 5500 sales were respectable but volumes were not at a level to keep 3dfx afloat.

==== GigaPixel and insolvency ====

On March 28, 2000, 3dfx bought GigaPixel for US$186 million, in order to help launch its Rampage product to market quicker. GigaPixel had previously almost won the contract to build Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox console, but lost out to Nvidia.

However, in late 2000, not long after the launch of the Voodoo 4, several of 3dfx&#x27;s creditors decided to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. 3dfx, as a whole, would have had virtually no chance of successfully contesting these proceedings, and instead opted to sell its assets to Nvidia, effectively ceasing to exist as a company. The resolution and legality of those arrangements (with respect to the purchase, 3dfx&#x27;s creditors and its bankruptcy proceedings) took over a decade to resolve in the federal courts. Specifically, the trustee of 3dfx&#x27;s bankruptcy estate challenged 3dfx&#x27;s sale of its assets to Nvidia as an allegedly fraudulent conveyance. On November 6, 2014, in an unpublished memorandum order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the &quot;district court&#x27;s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court&#x27;s determination that [Nvidia] did not pay less than fair market value for assets purchased from 3dfx shortly before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy&quot;.

A majority of the engineering and design team working on Rampage/Sage who remained with the transition, were requested and remained in house to work on what became the GeForce FX series. Others accepted employment with ATI to bring their knowledge to the creation of the X series of video cards and the development of Crossfire, their own version of SLI. 

The prototype Spectre 1000 cards were delivered to software developers mere days before declaring insolvency. The software team developed both device drivers and a binary-compatible soft emulation of the Rampage function set. Thus, there were working Windows NT device drivers within a few days of the power on of the Rampage system on the 2nd week of December, 2000. At the time of Nvidia&#x27;s acquisition, 3dfx had already been developing the successors to Spectre. &quot;Fear&quot;, based on a next-generation Rampage called Fusion, and Sage2. &quot;Mojo&quot; would combine both into a single die, implement tiled rendering, and showcase some advanced technologies from the GigaPixel acquisition. The unreleased Spectre 1000 card, based on Rampage, would eventually be leaked and tested. Performance indicated that it would have struggled to compete with Nvidia&#x27;s already-released GeForce 256, though the proposed Spectre 2000 and Spectre 3000 cards, which featured a combination of Rampage and Sage units, would have led the market until late 2002, with Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce 4 series.

After Nvidia acquired 3dfx&#x27;s intellectual property, they announced that they would not provide technical support for 3dfx products. As of 2019, drivers and support are still offered by community websites. However, while functional, the drivers do not carry a manufacturer&#x27;s backing and are considered beta software. For a limited time, Nvidia offered a program under which 3dfx owners could trade in their cards for Nvidia cards of similar performance. On December 15, 2000, 3dfx apologized to the customers with a final press release. In 2003, the source code for 3dfx drivers leaked, resulting in fan-made, updated drivers and further support.

Although 1997 was marked by analysts as a turning point for 3dfx due to the marketing led by the new CEO Greg Ballard, there was criticism of Ballard&#x27;s understanding of R&amp;D in the graphics industry. Single-card 2D/3D solutions were taking over the market, and although Ballard saw the need and attempted to direct the company there with the Voodoo Banshee and the Voodoo3, both of these cost the company millions in sales and lost market share while diverting vital resources from the Rampage project. Then 3dfx released word in early 1999 that the still-competitive Voodoo2 would support only OpenGL and Glide under Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 2000 operating system, and not Direct3D. Many games were transitioning to Direct3D at this point, and the announcement caused many PC gamers – the core demographic of 3dfx&#x27;s market – to switch to Nvidia or ATI offerings for their new machines.
Ballard resigned shortly after, in January 2000.

== Product development history ==

=== Voodoo Graphics PCI ===
A typical Voodoo Graphics PCI expansion card consisted of a DAC, a frame buffer processor and a texture mapping unit, along with 4 MB of EDO DRAM. The RAM and graphics processors operated at 50 MHz. It provided only 3D acceleration and as such the computer also needed a traditional video controller for conventional 2D software. A pass-through VGA cable daisy-chained the video controller to the Voodoo, which was itself connected to the monitor. The method used to engage the Voodoo&#x27;s output circuitry varied between cards, with some using mechanical relays while others utilized purely solid-state components. The mechanical relays emitted an audible &quot;clicking&quot; sound when they engaged and disengaged.

=== Voodoo Rush ===
In August 1997, 3dfx released the Voodoo Rush chipset, combining a Voodoo chip with a 2D chip that lay on the same circuit board, eliminating the need for a separate VGA card. Most cards were built with an Alliance Semiconductor AT25/AT3D 2D component, but there were some built with a Macronix chip and there were initial plans to partner with Trident but no such boards were ever marketed.

The Rush had the same specifications as Voodoo Graphics, but did not perform as well because the Rush chipset had to share memory bandwidth with the CRTC of the 2D chip. Furthermore, the Rush chipset was not directly present on the PCI bus but had to be programmed through linked registers of the 2D chip. Like the Voodoo Graphics, there was no interrupt mechanism, so the driver had to poll the Rush in order to determine whether a command had completed or not; the indirection through the 2D component added significant overhead here and tended to back up traffic on the PCI interface. The typical performance hit was around 10% compared to Voodoo Graphics, and even worse in windowed mode. Later, Rush boards were released by Hercules featuring 8 MiB VRAM and a 10% higher clock speed, in an attempt to close this performance gap.

Some manufacturers bundled a PC version of Atari Games&#x27; racing game &quot;San Francisco Rush&quot;, the arcade version of which utilised a slightly upgraded Voodoo Graphics chipset with an extra texture mapping unit and additional texture memory.

The Voodoo Rush was 3dfx&#x27;s first commercial failure. Sales were very poor, and the cards were discontinued within a year.

=== Voodoo2 ===

The 3dfx Voodoo2, the successor to the Voodoo Graphics chipset released in March 1998, was architecturally similar, but the basic board configuration added a second texturing unit, allowing two textures to be drawn in a single pass.

The Voodoo2 required three chips and a separate VGA graphics card, whereas new competing 3D products, such as the ATI Rage Pro, Nvidia RIVA 128, and Rendition Verite 2200, were single-chip products. Despite some shortcomings, such as the card&#x27;s dithered 16-bit 3D color rendering and 800x600 resolution limitations, no other manufacturers&#x27; products could match the smooth framerates that the Voodoo2 produced. It was a landmark (and expensive) achievement in PC 3D-graphics. Its excellent performance, and the mindshare gained from the original Voodoo Graphics, resulted in its success. Many users even preferred Voodoo2&#x27;s dedicated purpose, because they were free to use the quality 2D card of their choice as a result. Some 2D/3D combined solutions at the time offered quite sub-par 2D quality and speed. 

The Voodoo2 introduced Scan-Line Interleave (SLI), in which two Voodoo2 boards were connected together, each drawing half the scan lines of the screen. SLI increased the maximum resolution supported to 1024×768. Because of the high cost and inconvenience of using three separate graphics cards (two Voodoo2 SLI plus the general purpose 2D graphics adapter), the Voodoo2 SLI scheme had minimal effect on total market share and was not a financial success. SLI capability was not offered in subsequent 3dfx board designs, although the technology would be later used to link the VSA-100 chips on the Voodoo 5.

The arrival of the Nvidia RIVA TNT with integrated 2D/3D chipset would offer minor challenge to the Voodoo2&#x27;s supremacy months later.

=== Voodoo Banshee ===
Near the end of 1998, 3dfx released the Voodoo Banshee, which featured a lower price achieved through higher component integration, and a more complete feature-set including 2D acceleration, to target the mainstream consumer market. A single-chip solution, the Banshee was a combination of a 2D video card and partial (only one texture mapping unit) Voodoo2 3D hardware. Due to the missing second TMU, in 3D scenes which used multiple textures per polygon, the Voodoo2 was significantly faster. However, in scenes dominated by single-textured polygons, the Banshee could match or exceed the Voodoo2 due to its higher clock speed and resulting greater pixel fillrate.

Banshee&#x27;s 2D acceleration was the first such hardware from 3dfx and it was very capable. It rivaled the fastest 2D cores from Matrox, Nvidia, and ATI. It consisted of a 128-bit 2D GUI engine and a 128-bit VESA VBE 3.0 VGA core. The graphics chip capably accelerated DirectDraw and supported all of the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) in hardware, with all 256 raster operations and tertiary functions, and hardware polygon acceleration. The 2D core achieved near-theoretical maximum performance with a null driver test in Windows NT.

Voodoo Banshee supports MPEG2 video acceleration.

=== Voodoo3 ===
The Voodoo 3 was hyped as the graphics card that would make 3dfx the undisputed leader, but the actual product was below expectations. Though it was still the fastest as it edged the RIVA TNT2 by a small margin, the Voodoo3 lacked 32-bit color and large texture support. Though at that time few games supported large textures and 32-bit color, and those that did generally were too demanding to be run at playable framerates, the features &quot;32-bit color support&quot; and &quot;2048×2048 textures&quot; were much more impressive on paper than 16-bit color and 256×256 texture support. The Voodoo3 sold relatively well, but was disappointing compared to the first two models and 3dfx lost the market leadership to Nvidia.

As 3dfx attempted to counter the TNT2 threat, it was surprised by Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce 256. The GeForce was a single-chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping (hardware T&amp;L), and rendering engines, giving it a significant performance advantage over the Voodoo3. The 3dfx Voodoo3 2000 PCI was the highest-performance 2D/3D card available for the Apple Macintosh at the time of its release, though support from 3dfx was labeled as &#x27;beta&#x27; and required a firmware reflash. As game developers switched to DirectX and OpenGL, which respectively had become the industry standard and were becoming increasingly popular, 3dfx released its Glide API under the General Public License on December 6, 1999.

=== Voodoo 4 &amp; 5 ===
The Voodoo 5 5000, which had 32 MB of VRAM to the 5500&#x27;s 64 MB, was never launched.

The only other member of the Voodoo 5 line, the Voodoo 4 4500, was as much of a disaster as Voodoo Rush, because it had performance well short of its value-oriented peers combined with a late launch. Voodoo 4 was beaten in almost all areas by the GeForce 2 MX—a low-cost board sold mostly as an OEM part for computer manufacturers—and the Radeon VE.

One unusual trait of the Voodoo 4 and 5 was that the Macintosh versions of these cards had both VGA and DVI output jacks, whereas the PC versions had only the VGA connector. Also, the Mac versions of the Voodoo 4 and 5 had a weakness in that they did not support hardware-based MPEG2 decode acceleration, which hindered the playback of DVDs on a Mac equipped with a Voodoo graphics card.

The Voodoo 5 6000 never made it to market, due to a severe bug resulting in data corruption on the AGP bus on certain boards, and was limited to AGP 2x. It was thus incompatible with the new Pentium 4 motherboards. Only a few more than one thousand units of the graphics card were ever produced. Later tests proved that the Voodoo 5 6000 outperformed not only the GeForce 2 GTS and ATI Radeon 7200, but also the faster GeForce 2 Ultra and Radeon 7500. In some cases it was shown to compete well with the GeForce 3, trading performance places with the card on various tests. However, the prohibitively high production cost of the card, particularly the 4 chip setup, external power supply and 128 MB of VRAM (which would have made it the first consumer card with that amount of memory), would have likely hampered its competitiveness.

== Products ==
* 1 VGA: Whether the card included a built-in VGA subsystem and ran as a standalone graphics card
* 2 Texture mapping units:render output units – 3Dfx Velocity cards only have 1 working TMU enabled on OpenGL and Glide games, but both TMUs working under DirectX games.

<text>The 2002–03 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Barclaycard]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the 11th season of the Premier League, the top division in English football. The first matches were played on 17 August 2002 and the last were played on 11 May 2003.

Manchester United ended the campaign as champions for the eighth time in eleven years – an achievement made all the more remarkable by the fact that defending champions Arsenal had been in the lead by eight points on 2 March. After defeating Birmingham at the start of the season, Arsenal equalled a top-flight record of fourteen straight wins but failed to extend it in their next game at West Ham United, being held to a 2–2 draw. They remained unbeaten for 30 Premier League games, 23 of which were played away, until late October, and scored in a record 55 consecutive league games, beating the previous record of 47 set by Chesterfield during the 1930-31 Third Division North season. This run ended at Old Trafford on 7 December 2002, when Manchester United won 2–0. Arsenal then threw away a priceless lead against Bolton Wanderers and finally surrendered the title with a 3–2 home defeat to Leeds United in their antepenultimate game of the season, a result that also saved Leeds from relegation. Newcastle United and Chelsea were the remaining Champions League qualifiers, at the expense of Liverpool who had to settle for the UEFA Cup; they would be joined in Europe by Blackburn Rovers for a second successive season, along with Southampton who were back in Europe for the first time since 1984.

At the bottom end of the table, West Ham United, West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland were relegated to the Football League First Division; West Ham&#x27;s 42 points from a 38-game season was a record for a relegated team. Promoted to replace them were 2002–03 Football League First Division champions Portsmouth, runners-up Leicester City, and play-off winner Wolverhampton Wanderers.

==Teams==
Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Manchester City (immediately returning after a season&#x27;s absence), West Bromwich Albion, and Birmingham City (both teams returning to the top flight after a sixteen-year absence). This was also both West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City&#x27;s first season in the Premier League. They replaced Ipswich Town (relegated to the First Division after two seasons in the top flight), Derby County, and Leicester City (both teams relegated after a six-year presence).

<text>[[Consideration]] is the central concept in the common law of contracts and is required, in most cases, for a contract to be enforceable. Consideration is the price one pays for another&#x27;s promise. It can take a number of forms: money, property, a promise, the doing of an act, or even refraining from doing an act. In broad terms, if one agrees to do something he was not otherwise legally obligated to do, it may be said that he has given consideration. For example, Jack agrees to sell his car to Jill for $100. Jill&#x27;s payment of $100 (or her promise to do so) is the consideration for Jack&#x27;s promise to give Jill the car, and Jack&#x27;s promise to give Jill the car is consideration for Jill&#x27;s payment of $100.

==Elements of consideration==
The Restatement (Second) of Contracts states that the elements of consideration are as follows:

An example of this is renting of apartment. The landlord and tenant come together to discuss the terms of the exchange (most of the time, the leasing is outlined in a contract). Thus, they have fulfilled the first requirement of consideration. To meet the second element, there must be a mutual exchange. In this case, the landlord provides housing, while the tenant provides rent payment. Third, the bargain terms must be of value. The apartment is worth what the tenant hands over each month. Therefore, this contract has met its consideration requirement, because it fits all elements of consideration.

==Lack of Consideration==
*Past consideration is not valid. Something that is already done is done, and it does not change the legal position of the promisor. Any goods or services to be exchanged must be exchanged at or after the time of contract formation.
*Preexisting duty does not count as consideration.
*An illusory promise, or one which the promisor actually has no obligation to keep, does not count as consideration. The promise must be real and unconditional. This doctrine rarely invalidates contracts; it is a fundamental doctrine in contract law that courts should try to enforce contracts whenever possible. Accordingly, courts will often read implied-in-fact or implied-in-law terms into the contract, placing duties on the promisor. For instance, if a promisor promises to give away a third of his earnings for the year and earns nothing, he has no actual obligation to do anything.

==Exceptions to the Consideration Requirement==
Modern contract theory has also permitted remedies on alternative theories such as promissory estoppel. Also, modifications to existing lease agreements (as opposed to the creation of a new lease agreement) do not require consideration, nor do modifications to existing sale contracts. Furthermore, a promise to perform a moral obligation—the classic example is of a promise to support a person injured while coming to the rescue of the promisor—is enforceable provided the promissee was harmed in conferring a benefit on the promisor and the promise is not disproportionate to the benefit. The promise to pay a debt discharged by bankruptcy, the promise to perform a conditional responsibility despite the nonoccurrence of the condition, and the promise to perform on a voidable contract form a category of moral obligations that can bind in the absence of consideration.

==Contract modification==
Service contracts and, in the United States, other contracts not governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, generally require consideration to modify a contract (because of what is called the pre-existing duty rule).

==Theories of Consideration==
There are two common theories that attempt to explain consideration. The first is &quot;benefit-detriment theory,&quot; in which a contract must be either to the benefit of the promisor or to the detriment of the promisee to constitute consideration (though detriment to the promisee is the essential and invariable test of the existence of a consideration rather than whether it can be constituted by benefit to the promisor). The second is &quot;bargain theory,&quot; in which the parties subjectively view the contract to be the product of an exchange or bargain. Bargain theory has largely replaced benefit-detriment theory in modern contract theory, but judges often cite both and may use both models in their decisions. These theories usually overlap; in standard contracts, such as a contract to buy a car, there will be both an objective benefit and detriment. However, there are certain contracts which satisfy one but not the other. For instance, a deal in which the promisee feels subjectively relieved, but has not actually gained any legal rights, might satisfy the bargain theory but not the benefit-detriment theory. Alternatively, a deal in which an actor takes detrimental actions possibly in reaction to an offer, without having viewed the deal as a bargain, would not be viewed as a contract under the law.

The main purpose of the shift from benefit-detriment to bargain theory is to avoid inquiries into whether consideration is adequate. For example, if a person promised you their car for $1.00 because they needed to get rid of it, then the $1.00 might seem adequate. However, if it were your birthday and your friend wrote down &quot;I give you my car in consideration of one dollar,&quot; this same consideration would not seem adequate. Thus whether $1.00 is consideration does not depend on the benefit received but whether the $1.00 had actually been bargained for.

In some jurisdictions, contracts calling for such nominal or &quot;peppercorn&quot; consideration will be upheld unless a particular contract is deemed unconscionable. However, in other jurisdictions, the court will reject &quot;consideration&quot; that had not been truly bargained for. Occasionally the courts in these jurisdictions may refer to &quot;adequate&quot; or &quot;valuable&quot; consideration, but in reality the court is not examining the adequacy of consideration, but whether it had been bargained for. The traditional notion that courts won&#x27;t look into the adequacy of consideration, an ancient notion in the English common law, doesn&#x27;t square with the benefit-detriment theory (in which courts are implicitly analyzing if the parties are receiving a sufficient benefit) but does square with the bargain theory (in which only the subjective intentions of the parties are considered).

==Purposes of Consideration==
There are three main purposes cited for the consideration requirement. The first is the cautionary requirement - parties are more likely to look before they leap when making a bargain than when making an off-the-cuff promise of a gift. The second is the evidentiary requirement - parties are more likely to commemorate, or at least remember, a promise made due to a bargaining process. The third is the channeling requirement - parties are more likely to coherently stipulate their specific desires when they are forced to bargain for them. Each of these rationales ensure that contracts are made by serious parties and are not made in error.

<doc id="226630" wikidata="Q6570219" url="?curid=226630" title="List of English words without rhymes">
<text>The following is a list of English words without rhymes, called refractory rhymes—that is, a list of words in the English language that rhyme with no other English word. The word &quot;rhyme&quot; here is used in the strict sense, called a &quot;perfect rhyme&quot;, that the words are pronounced the same from the vowel of the main stressed syllable onwards. The list was compiled from the point of view of Received Pronunciation (with a few exceptions for General American), and may not work for other accents or dialects. Multiple-word rhymes (a phrase that rhymes with a word, known as a &quot;phrasal&quot; or &quot;mosaic&quot; rhyme), self-rhymes (adding a prefix to a word and counting it as a rhyme of itself), imperfect rhymes (such as &quot;purple&quot; with &quot;circle&quot;), and identical rhymes (words that are identical in their stressed syllables, such as &quot;bay&quot; and &quot;obey&quot;) are often not counted as true rhymes and have not been considered. Only the list of one-syllable words can hope to be anything near complete; for polysyllabic words, rhymes are the exception rather than the rule.

==Definition of &quot;perfect rhyme&quot;==
Following the strict definition of rhyme, a perfect rhyme demands the exact match of all sounds from the last stressed vowel to the end of the word. Therefore, words with the stress far from the end are more likely to have no perfect rhymes. For instance, a perfect rhyme for &quot;discomulate&quot; would have to rhyme three syllables, &quot;-ulate.&quot; There are many words that match most of the sounds from the stressed vowel onwards and so are near rhymes, called slant rhymes. &quot;Ovulate&quot;, &quot;copulate&quot;, and &quot;populate&quot;, for example, vary only slightly in one consonant from &quot;discombobulate&quot;, and thus provide very usable rhymes for most situations in which a rhyme for &quot;discombobulate&quot; is desired. However, no other English word has exactly these three final syllables with this stress pattern. And since in most traditions the stressed syllable should not be identical—the consonant before the stressed vowel should be different—adding a prefix to a word, as &quot;be-elbow&quot; for &quot;elbow&quot;, does not create a perfect rhyme for it.

Words that rhyme in one accent or dialect may not rhyme in another. A commonplace example of this is the word &quot;of&quot; , which when stressed had no rhymes in British Received Pronunciation prior to the 19th century, but which rhymed with &quot;grave&quot; and &quot;mauve&quot; in some varieties of General American. In the other direction, &quot;iron&quot; has no rhyme in General American, but many in RP. Words may also have more than one pronunciation, one with a rhyme, and one without.

==Words with obscure perfect rhymes==
This list includes rhymes of words that have been listed as rhymeless.

* &quot;&quot; rhymes with &quot;liberum arbitrium&quot;, a legal term.

== Non-rhyming English words ==

The majority of words with antepenultimate stress, such as &quot;ambulance&quot;, &quot;citizen, dangerous&quot; and &quot;obvious&quot;, are non-rhyming. Also, most words with stress, such as &quot;(un)necessary, logarithm, algorithm&quot; and &quot;sacrificing&quot;, have no rhyme.

===Masculine rhymes===
Refractory one-syllable rhymes are uncommon; there may be fewer than a hundred in English. A great many end in a present or historical suffix &quot;-th&quot;, or are plural or participle forms. This list includes a few polysyllabic masculine rhymes such as &quot;obliged&quot;, which have one syllable in their rhyming part.
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; /-ælb/ (rhymes with some pronunciations of the proper noun &quot;Kalb&quot; in the name of Johann de Kalb)
# &quot;&quot; /-ʌŋst/ (&quot;quincunxed&quot; could qualify as a rhyme if its second syllable is given secondary stress and if secondary stress is considered sufficient for a perfect rhyme)
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; (could rhyme with a dialectal North American pronunciation of &quot;washed&quot; as &quot;worshed/warshed&quot;)
# &quot;borshch&quot; /- ɔrʃtʃ/ (pronunciation variant of the above, rhymes with obscure towns in Russia such as Belogorshch)
# &quot;, -s&quot; 
# &quot;, -s, -ed&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; (may rhyme with &quot;valsed&quot; in British English, according to the Oxford English Dictionary)
# &quot;&quot; (combinations) 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;, -s&quot; 
# &quot;, -s&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; (verb) 
# &quot;, -ed, -s&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; (but not when pronounced as )
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;, -s&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; or 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;, -s&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;, -s&quot; The &quot;f&quot; in &quot;twelfth&quot; is commonly elided in casual speech, causing &quot;twelfth&quot; to rhyme with &quot;health&quot; and &quot;wealth&quot;.
# &quot;, -ed, -s&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; (the word is also pronounced with , in which case it has rhymes like &quot;pith&quot;)
# &quot;, -ed, -s&quot; 
# &quot;, -d, -s&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; have no rhymes in conservative RP. However, the distinction between &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;hoarse&quot; has been mostly lost in younger generations, and for them and many others &quot;pork&quot; which was an exception to the normal rule, now rhymes with &quot;fork&quot; and &quot;cork&quot; (), while &quot;forge&quot; now rhymes with &quot;gorge&quot;. The OED no longer lists as an alternative pronunciation in its third edition.

Nonce words ending in &quot;-ed&quot; (&#x27;provided with&#x27;) may produce other potentially refractory masculine rhymes. There are additional words which are only partially assimilated into English, such as Russian &quot;&quot; , which are refractory rhymes.

The contraction &quot;&quot; has no known rhymes in any English dialect, however the legitimacy of contractions as a single word is disputed. Regardless of this, &quot;daren&#x27;t&quot; lacks both perfect rhymes and phrasal rhymes.

Although not meant as a complete list, there are some additional refractory rhymes in GA. Some of these are due to RP being a non-rhotic accent, and having merged rhymes formerly distinguished by .
# &quot;, -s&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 

===Feminine rhymes===
For feminine rhymes, the final two syllables must match to count as a rhyme. Once the stress shifts to the penultimate syllable, rhymeless words are quite common, perhaps even the norm: there may be more rhymeless words than words with rhymes. The following words are representative, but there are thousands of others.
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot; 
# &quot;&quot;

<text>In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is a statistical model that models the log-odds of an event as a linear combination of one or more independent variables. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) estimates the parameters of a logistic model (the coefficients in the linear or non linear combinations). In binary logistic regression there is a single binary dependent variable, coded by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, while the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value). The corresponding probability of the value labeled &quot;1&quot; can vary between 0 (certainly the value &quot;0&quot;) and 1 (certainly the value &quot;1&quot;), hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name. The unit of measurement for the log-odds scale is called a &quot;logit&quot;, from logistic unit, hence the alternative names. See and for formal mathematics, and for a worked example.

Binary variables are widely used in statistics to model the probability of a certain class or event taking place, such as the probability of a team winning, of a patient being healthy, etc. (see ), and the logistic model has been the most commonly used model for binary regression since about 1970. Binary variables can be generalized to categorical variables when there are more than two possible values (e.g. whether an image is of a cat, dog, lion, etc.), and the binary logistic regression generalized to multinomial logistic regression. If the multiple categories are ordered, one can use the ordinal logistic regression (for example the proportional odds ordinal logistic model). See for further extensions. The logistic regression model itself simply models probability of output in terms of input and does not perform statistical classification (it is not a classifier), though it can be used to make a classifier, for instance by choosing a cutoff value and classifying inputs with probability greater than the cutoff as one class, below the cutoff as the other; this is a common way to make a binary classifier.

Analogous linear models for binary variables with a different sigmoid function instead of the logistic function (to convert the linear combination to a probability) can also be used, most notably the probit model; see . The defining characteristic of the logistic model is that increasing one of the independent variables multiplicatively scales the odds of the given outcome at a &quot;constant&quot; rate, with each independent variable having its own parameter; for a binary dependent variable this generalizes the odds ratio. More abstractly, the logistic function is the natural parameter for the Bernoulli distribution, and in this sense is the &quot;simplest&quot; way to convert a real number to a probability. In particular, it maximizes entropy (minimizes added information), and in this sense makes the fewest assumptions of the data being modeled; see .

The parameters of a logistic regression are most commonly estimated by maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). This does not have a closed-form expression, unlike linear least squares; see . Logistic regression by MLE plays a similarly basic role for binary or categorical responses as linear regression by ordinary least squares (OLS) plays for scalar responses: it is a simple, well-analyzed baseline model; see for discussion. The logistic regression as a general statistical model was originally developed and popularized primarily by Joseph Berkson, beginning in , where he coined &quot;logit&quot;; see .


==Applications==

=== General ===
Logistic regression is used in various fields, including machine learning, most medical fields, and social sciences. For example, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is widely used to predict mortality in injured patients, was originally developed by Boyd &quot;&quot; using logistic regression. Many other medical scales used to assess severity of a patient have been developed using logistic regression. Logistic regression may be used to predict the risk of developing a given disease (e.g. diabetes; coronary heart disease), based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, sex, body mass index, results of various blood tests, etc.). Another example might be to predict whether a Nepalese voter will vote Nepali Congress or Communist Party of Nepal or Any Other Party, based on age, income, sex, race, state of residence, votes in previous elections, etc. The technique can also be used in engineering, especially for predicting the probability of failure of a given process, system or product. It is also used in marketing applications such as prediction of a customer&#x27;s propensity to purchase a product or halt a subscription, etc. In economics, it can be used to predict the likelihood of a person ending up in the labor force, and a business application would be to predict the likelihood of a homeowner defaulting on a mortgage. Conditional random fields, an extension of logistic regression to sequential data, are used in natural language processing. Disaster planners and engineers rely on these models to predict decisions taken by householders or building occupants in small-scale and large-scales evacuations, such as building fires, wildfires, hurricanes among others. These models help in the development of reliable disaster managing plans and safer design for the built environment.

=== Supervised machine learning ===
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks, such as identifying whether an email is spam or not and diagnosing diseases by assessing the presence or absence of specific conditions based on patient test results. This approach utilizes the logistic (or sigmoid) function to transform a linear combination of input features into a probability value ranging between 0 and 1. This probability indicates the likelihood that a given input corresponds to one of two predefined categories. The essential mechanism of logistic regression is grounded in the logistic function&#x27;s ability to model the probability of binary outcomes accurately. With its distinctive S-shaped curve, the logistic function effectively maps any real-valued number to a value within the 0 to 1 interval. This feature renders it particularly suitable for binary classification tasks, such as sorting emails into &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;not spam&quot;. By calculating the probability that the dependent variable will be categorized into a specific group, logistic regression provides a probabilistic framework that supports informed decision-making.

==Example==
===Problem===
As a simple example, we can use a logistic regression with one explanatory variable and two categories to answer the following question:

A group of 20 students spends between 0 and 6 hours studying for an exam. How does the number of hours spent studying affect the probability of the student passing the exam?
The reason for using logistic regression for this problem is that the values of the dependent variable, pass and fail, while represented by &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot;, are not cardinal numbers. If the problem was changed so that pass/fail was replaced with the grade 0–100 (cardinal numbers), then simple regression analysis could be used.

The table shows the number of hours each student spent studying, and whether they passed (1) or failed (0).
We wish to fit a logistic function to the data consisting of the hours studied (&quot;xk&quot;) and the outcome of the test (&quot;yk&quot; =1 for pass, 0 for fail). The data points are indexed by the subscript &quot;k&quot; which runs from formula_1 to formula_2. The &quot;x&quot; variable is called the &quot;explanatory variable&quot;, and the &quot;y&quot; variable is called the &quot;categorical variable&quot; consisting of two categories: &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot; corresponding to the categorical values 1 and 0 respectively.

===Model===
The logistic function is of the form:

:formula_3

where &quot;μ&quot; is a location parameter (the midpoint of the curve, where formula_4) and &quot;s&quot; is a scale parameter. This expression may be rewritten as:

:formula_5

where formula_6 and is known as the intercept (it is the &quot;vertical&quot; intercept or &quot;y&quot;-intercept of the line formula_7), and formula_8 (inverse scale parameter or rate parameter): these are the &quot;y&quot;-intercept and slope of the log-odds as a function of &quot;x&quot;. Conversely, formula_9 and formula_10.

Remark: This model is actually an oversimplification, since it assumes everybody will pass if they learn long enough (limit = 1). The limit value should be a variable parameter too, if you want to make it more realistic.

===Fit===
The usual measure of goodness of fit for a logistic regression uses logistic loss (or log loss), the negative log-likelihood. For a given &quot;xk&quot; and &quot;yk&quot;, write formula_11. The are the probabilities that the corresponding will equal one and are the probabilities that they will be zero (see Bernoulli distribution). We wish to find the values of and which give the &quot;best fit&quot; to the data. In the case of linear regression, the sum of the squared deviations of the fit from the data points (&quot;yk&quot;), the squared error loss, is taken as a measure of the goodness of fit, and the best fit is obtained when that function is &quot;minimized&quot;.

The log loss for the &quot;k&quot;-th point is:
:formula_12

The log loss can be interpreted as the &quot;surprisal&quot; of the actual outcome relative to the prediction , and is a measure of information content. Log loss is always greater than or equal to 0, equals 0 only in case of a perfect prediction (i.e., when formula_13 and formula_14, or formula_15 and formula_16), and approaches infinity as the prediction gets worse (i.e., when formula_14 and formula_18 or formula_19 and formula_20), meaning the actual outcome is &quot;more surprising&quot;. Since the value of the logistic function is always strictly between zero and one, the log loss is always greater than zero and less than infinity. Unlike in a linear regression, where the model can have zero loss at a point by passing through a data point (and zero loss overall if all points are on a line), in a logistic regression it is not possible to have zero loss at any points, since is either 0 or 1, but .

These can be combined into a single expression:
:formula_21

This expression is more formally known as the cross-entropy of the predicted distribution formula_22 from the actual distribution formula_23, as probability distributions on the two-element space of (pass, fail).

The sum of these, the total loss, is the overall negative log-likelihood , and the best fit is obtained for those choices of and for which is &quot;minimized&quot;.

Alternatively, instead of &quot;minimizing&quot; the loss, one can &quot;maximize&quot; its inverse, the (positive) log-likelihood:
:formula_24
or equivalently maximize the likelihood function itself, which is the probability that the given data set is produced by a particular logistic function:
:formula_25
This method is known as maximum likelihood estimation.

===Parameter estimation===
Since &quot;ℓ&quot; is nonlinear in and , determining their optimum values will require numerical methods. One method of maximizing &quot;ℓ&quot; is to require the derivatives of &quot;ℓ&quot; with respect to and to be zero:

:formula_26

:formula_27

and the maximization procedure can be accomplished by solving the above two equations for and , which, again, will generally require the use of numerical methods.

The values of and which maximize &quot;ℓ&quot; and &quot;L&quot; using the above data are found to be:

:formula_28
:formula_29

which yields a value for &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;s&quot; of:

:formula_30
:formula_31

===Predictions===
The and coefficients may be entered into the logistic regression equation to estimate the probability of passing the exam.

For example, for a student who studies 2 hours, entering the value formula_32 into the equation gives the estimated probability of passing the exam of 0.25:

: formula_33

: formula_34

Similarly, for a student who studies 4 hours, the estimated probability of passing the exam is 0.87:

: formula_35

: formula_36

This table shows the estimated probability of passing the exam for several values of hours studying.

===Model evaluation===
The logistic regression analysis gives the following output.

By the Wald test, the output indicates that hours studying is significantly associated with the probability of passing the exam (formula_37). Rather than the Wald method, the recommended method to calculate the &quot;p&quot;-value for logistic regression is the likelihood-ratio test (LRT), which for these data give formula_38 (see below).

===Generalizations===
This simple model is an example of binary logistic regression, and has one explanatory variable and a binary categorical variable which can assume one of two categorical values. Multinomial logistic regression is the generalization of binary logistic regression to include any number of explanatory variables and any number of categories.

==Background==
===Definition of the logistic function===
An explanation of logistic regression can begin with an explanation of the standard logistic function. The logistic function is a sigmoid function, which takes any real input formula_39, and outputs a value between zero and one. For the logit, this is interpreted as taking input log-odds and having output probability. The &quot;standard&quot; logistic function formula_40 is defined as follows:

:formula_41

A graph of the logistic function on the &quot;t&quot;-interval (−6,6) is shown in Figure 1.

Let us assume that formula_39 is a linear function of a single explanatory variable formula_43 (the case where formula_39 is a &quot;linear combination&quot; of multiple explanatory variables is treated similarly). We can then express formula_39 as follows:

:formula_46

And the general logistic function formula_47 can now be written as:

:formula_48

In the logistic model, formula_49 is interpreted as the probability of the dependent variable formula_50 equaling a success/case rather than a failure/non-case. It is clear that the response variables formula_51 are not identically distributed: formula_52 differs from one data point formula_53 to another, though they are independent given design matrix formula_54 and shared parameters formula_55.

===Definition of the inverse of the logistic function===
We can now define the logit (log odds) function as the inverse formula_56 of the standard logistic function. It is easy to see that it satisfies:

:formula_57

and equivalently, after exponentiating both sides we have the odds:

:formula_58

===Interpretation of these terms===
In the above equations, the terms are as follows:

* formula_59 is the logit function. The equation for formula_60 illustrates that the logit (i.e., log-odds or natural logarithm of the odds) is equivalent to the linear regression expression.
* formula_61 denotes the natural logarithm.
* formula_49 is the probability that the dependent variable equals a case, given some linear combination of the predictors. The formula for formula_49 illustrates that the probability of the dependent variable equaling a case is equal to the value of the logistic function of the linear regression expression. This is important in that it shows that the value of the linear regression expression can vary from negative to positive infinity and yet, after transformation, the resulting expression for the probability formula_49 ranges between 0 and 1.
* formula_65 is the intercept from the linear regression equation (the value of the criterion when the predictor is equal to zero).
* formula_66 is the regression coefficient multiplied by some value of the predictor.
* base formula_67 denotes the exponential function.

===Definition of the odds===
The odds of the dependent variable equaling a case (given some linear combination formula_43 of the predictors) is equivalent to the exponential function of the linear regression expression. This illustrates how the logit serves as a link function between the probability and the linear regression expression. Given that the logit ranges between negative and positive infinity, it provides an adequate criterion upon which to conduct linear regression and the logit is easily converted back into the odds.

So we define odds of the dependent variable equaling a case (given some linear combination formula_43 of the predictors) as follows:

:formula_70

===The odds ratio===
For a continuous independent variable the odds ratio can be defined as:

:formula_71

This exponential relationship provides an interpretation for formula_72: The odds multiply by formula_73 for every 1-unit increase in x.

For a binary independent variable the odds ratio is defined as formula_74 where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are cells in a 2×2 contingency table.

===Multiple explanatory variables===
If there are multiple explanatory variables, the above expression formula_75 can be revised to formula_76. Then when this is used in the equation relating the log odds of a success to the values of the predictors, the linear regression will be a multiple regression with &quot;m&quot; explanators; the parameters formula_77 for all formula_78 are all estimated.

Again, the more traditional equations are:

:formula_79

and

:formula_80

where usually formula_81.

==Definition==
A dataset contains &quot;N&quot; points. Each point &quot;i&quot; consists of a set of &quot;m&quot; input variables &quot;x&quot;1,&quot;i&quot; ... &quot;x&quot;&quot;m,i&quot; (also called independent variables, explanatory variables, predictor variables, features, or attributes), and a binary outcome variable &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; (also known as a dependent variable, response variable, output variable, or class), i.e. it can assume only the two possible values 0 (often meaning &quot;no&quot; or &quot;failure&quot;) or 1 (often meaning &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;success&quot;). The goal of logistic regression is to use the dataset to create a predictive model of the outcome variable.

As in linear regression, the outcome variables &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; are assumed to depend on the explanatory variables &quot;x&quot;1,&quot;i&quot; ... &quot;x&quot;&quot;m,i&quot;.

; Explanatory variables
The explanatory variables may be of any type: real-valued, binary, categorical, etc. The main distinction is between continuous variables and discrete variables.

(Discrete variables referring to more than two possible choices are typically coded using dummy variables (or indicator variables), that is, separate explanatory variables taking the value 0 or 1 are created for each possible value of the discrete variable, with a 1 meaning &quot;variable does have the given value&quot; and a 0 meaning &quot;variable does not have that value&quot;.)

;Outcome variables
Formally, the outcomes &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; are described as being Bernoulli-distributed data, where each outcome is determined by an unobserved probability &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; that is specific to the outcome at hand, but related to the explanatory variables. This can be expressed in any of the following equivalent forms:

::formula_82

The meanings of these four lines are:
# The first line expresses the probability distribution of each &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; : conditioned on the explanatory variables, it follows a Bernoulli distribution with parameters &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, the probability of the outcome of 1 for trial &quot;i&quot;. As noted above, each separate trial has its own probability of success, just as each trial has its own explanatory variables. The probability of success &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; is not observed, only the outcome of an individual Bernoulli trial using that probability.
# The second line expresses the fact that the expected value of each &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; is equal to the probability of success &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, which is a general property of the Bernoulli distribution. In other words, if we run a large number of Bernoulli trials using the same probability of success &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, then take the average of all the 1 and 0 outcomes, then the result would be close to &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;. This is because doing an average this way simply computes the proportion of successes seen, which we expect to converge to the underlying probability of success.
# The third line writes out the probability mass function of the Bernoulli distribution, specifying the probability of seeing each of the two possible outcomes.
# The fourth line is another way of writing the probability mass function, which avoids having to write separate cases and is more convenient for certain types of calculations. This relies on the fact that &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; can take only the value 0 or 1. In each case, one of the exponents will be 1, &quot;choosing&quot; the value under it, while the other is 0, &quot;canceling out&quot; the value under it. Hence, the outcome is either &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; or 1 − &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, as in the previous line.

; Linear predictor function
The basic idea of logistic regression is to use the mechanism already developed for linear regression by modeling the probability &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; using a linear predictor function, i.e. a linear combination of the explanatory variables and a set of regression coefficients that are specific to the model at hand but the same for all trials. The linear predictor function formula_83 for a particular data point &quot;i&quot; is written as:

:formula_84

where formula_85 are regression coefficients indicating the relative effect of a particular explanatory variable on the outcome.

The model is usually put into a more compact form as follows:
* The regression coefficients &quot;β&quot;0, &quot;β&quot;1, ..., &quot;β&quot;&quot;m&quot; are grouped into a single vector β of size &quot;m&quot; + 1.
* For each data point &quot;i&quot;, an additional explanatory pseudo-variable &quot;x&quot;0,&quot;i&quot; is added, with a fixed value of 1, corresponding to the intercept coefficient &quot;β&quot;0.
* The resulting explanatory variables &quot;x&quot;0,&quot;i&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1,&quot;i&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;m,i&quot; are then grouped into a single vector Xi of size &quot;m&quot; + 1.

This makes it possible to write the linear predictor function as follows:

:formula_86

using the notation for a dot product between two vectors.
=== Many explanatory variables, two categories ===

The above example of binary logistic regression on one explanatory variable can be generalized to binary logistic regression on any number of explanatory variables &quot;x1, x2...&quot; and any number of categorical values formula_87.

To begin with, we may consider a logistic model with &quot;M&quot; explanatory variables, &quot;x1&quot;, &quot;x2&quot; ... &quot;xM&quot; and, as in the example above, two categorical values (&quot;y&quot; = 0 and 1). For the simple binary logistic regression model, we assumed a linear relationship between the predictor variable and the log-odds (also called logit) of the event that formula_88. This linear relationship may be extended to the case of &quot;M&quot; explanatory variables:

:formula_89

where &quot;t&quot; is the log-odds and formula_77 are parameters of the model. An additional generalization has been introduced in which the base of the model (&quot;b&quot;) is not restricted to Euler&#x27;s number &quot;e&quot;. In most applications, the base formula_91 of the logarithm is usually taken to be &quot;e&quot;. However, in some cases it can be easier to communicate results by working in base 2 or base 10.

For a more compact notation, we will specify the explanatory variables and the &quot;β&quot; coefficients as -dimensional vectors:

:formula_92
:formula_93

with an added explanatory variable &quot;x0&quot; =1. The logit may now be written as:

:formula_94

Solving for the probability &quot;p&quot; that formula_88 yields:

:formula_96,

where formula_97 is the sigmoid function with base formula_91. The above formula shows that once the formula_99 are fixed, we can easily compute either the log-odds that formula_88 for a given observation, or the probability that formula_88 for a given observation. The main use-case of a logistic model is to be given an observation formula_102, and estimate the probability formula_103 that formula_88. The optimum beta coefficients may again be found by maximizing the log-likelihood. For &quot;K&quot; measurements, defining formula_105 as the explanatory vector of the &quot;k&quot;-th measurement, and formula_106 as the categorical outcome of that measurement, the log likelihood may be written in a form very similar to the simple formula_107 case above:

:formula_108

As in the simple example above, finding the optimum &quot;β&quot; parameters will require numerical methods. One useful technique is to equate the derivatives of the log likelihood with respect to each of the &quot;β&quot; parameters to zero yielding a set of equations which will hold at the maximum of the log likelihood:

:formula_109

where &quot;xmk&quot; is the value of the &quot;xm&quot; explanatory variable from the &quot;k-th&quot; measurement.

Consider an example with formula_110 explanatory variables, formula_111, and coefficients formula_112, formula_113, and formula_114 which have been determined by the above method. To be concrete, the model is:

:formula_115
:formula_116,

where &quot;p&quot; is the probability of the event that formula_88. This can be interpreted as follows:

* formula_118 is the &quot;y&quot;-intercept. It is the log-odds of the event that formula_88, when the predictors formula_120. By exponentiating, we can see that when formula_120 the odds of the event that formula_88 are 1-to-1000, or formula_123. Similarly, the probability of the event that formula_88 when formula_120 can be computed as formula_126
* formula_127 means that increasing formula_128 by 1 increases the log-odds by formula_129. So if formula_128 increases by 1, the odds that formula_88 increase by a factor of formula_132. The probability of formula_88 has also increased, but it has not increased by as much as the odds have increased.
* formula_134 means that increasing formula_135 by 1 increases the log-odds by formula_136. So if formula_135 increases by 1, the odds that formula_88 increase by a factor of formula_139 Note how the effect of formula_135 on the log-odds is twice as great as the effect of formula_128, but the effect on the odds is 10 times greater. But the effect on the probability of formula_88 is not as much as 10 times greater, it&#x27;s only the effect on the odds that is 10 times greater.

=== Multinomial logistic regression: Many explanatory variables and many categories ===
In the above cases of two categories (binomial logistic regression), the categories were indexed by &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, and we had two probabilities: The probability that the outcome was in category 1 was given by formula_103and the probability that the outcome was in category 0 was given by formula_144. The sum of these probabilities equals 1, which must be true, since &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; are the only possible categories in this setup.

In general, if we have explanatory variables (including &quot;x0&quot;) and categories, we will need separate probabilities, one for each category, indexed by &quot;n&quot;, which describe the probability that the categorical outcome &quot;y&quot; will be in category &quot;y=n&quot;, conditional on the vector of covariates x. The sum of these probabilities over all categories must equal 1. Using the mathematically convenient base &quot;e&quot;, these probabilities are:

:formula_145 for formula_146
:formula_147

Each of the probabilities except formula_148 will have their own set of regression coefficients formula_149. It can be seen that, as required, the sum of the formula_150 over all categories &quot;n&quot; is 1. The selection of formula_148 to be defined in terms of the other probabilities is artificial. Any of the probabilities could have been selected to be so defined. This special value of &quot;n&quot; is termed the &quot;pivot index&quot;, and the log-odds (&quot;tn&quot;) are expressed in terms of the pivot probability and are again expressed as a linear combination of the explanatory variables:

:formula_152

Note also that for the simple case of formula_153, the two-category case is recovered, with formula_154 and formula_155.

The log-likelihood that a particular set of &quot;K&quot; measurements or data points will be generated by the above probabilities can now be calculated. Indexing each measurement by &quot;k&quot;, let the &quot;k&quot;-th set of measured explanatory variables be denoted by formula_105 and their categorical outcomes be denoted by formula_106 which can be equal to any integer in [0,N]. The log-likelihood is then:

:formula_158

where formula_159 is an indicator function which equals 1 if &quot;yk = n&quot; and zero otherwise. In the case of two explanatory variables, this indicator function was defined as &quot;yk&quot; when &quot;n&quot; = 1 and &quot;1-yk&quot; when &quot;n&quot; = 0. This was convenient, but not necessary. Again, the optimum beta coefficients may be found by maximizing the log-likelihood function generally using numerical methods. A possible method of solution is to set the derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to each beta coefficient equal to zero and solve for the beta coefficients:

:formula_160

where formula_161 is the &quot;m&quot;-th coefficient of the formula_149 vector and formula_163 is the &quot;m&quot;-th explanatory variable of the &quot;k&quot;-th measurement. Once the beta coefficients have been estimated from the data, we will be able to estimate the probability that any subsequent set of explanatory variables will result in any of the possible outcome categories.

==Interpretations==
There are various equivalent specifications and interpretations of logistic regression, which fit into different types of more general models, and allow different generalizations.

===As a generalized linear model===
The particular model used by logistic regression, which distinguishes it from standard linear regression and from other types of regression analysis used for binary-valued outcomes, is the way the probability of a particular outcome is linked to the linear predictor function:

:formula_164

Written using the more compact notation described above, this is:

:formula_165

This formulation expresses logistic regression as a type of generalized linear model, which predicts variables with various types of probability distributions by fitting a linear predictor function of the above form to some sort of arbitrary transformation of the expected value of the variable.

The intuition for transforming using the logit function (the natural log of the odds) was explained above. It also has the practical effect of converting the probability (which is bounded to be between 0 and 1) to a variable that ranges over formula_166 — thereby matching the potential range of the linear prediction function on the right side of the equation.

Both the probabilities &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; and the regression coefficients are unobserved, and the means of determining them is not part of the model itself. They are typically determined by some sort of optimization procedure, e.g. maximum likelihood estimation, that finds values that best fit the observed data (i.e. that give the most accurate predictions for the data already observed), usually subject to regularization conditions that seek to exclude unlikely values, e.g. extremely large values for any of the regression coefficients. The use of a regularization condition is equivalent to doing maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, an extension of maximum likelihood. (Regularization is most commonly done using a squared regularizing function, which is equivalent to placing a zero-mean Gaussian prior distribution on the coefficients, but other regularizers are also possible.) Whether or not regularization is used, it is usually not possible to find a closed-form solution; instead, an iterative numerical method must be used, such as iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) or, more commonly these days, a quasi-Newton method such as the L-BFGS method.

The interpretation of the &quot;β&quot;&quot;j&quot; parameter estimates is as the additive effect on the log of the odds for a unit change in the &quot;j&quot; the explanatory variable. In the case of a dichotomous explanatory variable, for instance, gender formula_167 is the estimate of the odds of having the outcome for, say, males compared with females.

An equivalent formula uses the inverse of the logit function, which is the logistic function, i.e.:

:formula_168

The formula can also be written as a probability distribution (specifically, using a probability mass function):

: formula_169

===As a latent-variable model===
The logistic model has an equivalent formulation as a latent-variable model. This formulation is common in the theory of discrete choice models and makes it easier to extend to certain more complicated models with multiple, correlated choices, as well as to compare logistic regression to the closely related probit model.

Imagine that, for each trial &quot;i&quot;, there is a continuous latent variable &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;* (i.e. an unobserved random variable) that is distributed as follows:

: formula_170
where
: formula_171
i.e. the latent variable can be written directly in terms of the linear predictor function and an additive random error variable that is distributed according to a standard logistic distribution.

Then &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; can be viewed as an indicator for whether this latent variable is positive:
: formula_172

The choice of modeling the error variable specifically with a standard logistic distribution, rather than a general logistic distribution with the location and scale set to arbitrary values, seems restrictive, but in fact, it is not. It must be kept in mind that we can choose the regression coefficients ourselves, and very often can use them to offset changes in the parameters of the error variable&#x27;s distribution. For example, a logistic error-variable distribution with a non-zero location parameter &quot;μ&quot; (which sets the mean) is equivalent to a distribution with a zero location parameter, where &quot;μ&quot; has been added to the intercept coefficient. Both situations produce the same value for &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;* regardless of settings of explanatory variables. Similarly, an arbitrary scale parameter &quot;s&quot; is equivalent to setting the scale parameter to 1 and then dividing all regression coefficients by &quot;s&quot;. In the latter case, the resulting value of &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;*&quot; will be smaller by a factor of &quot;s&quot; than in the former case, for all sets of explanatory variables — but critically, it will always remain on the same side of 0, and hence lead to the same &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; choice.

(This predicts that the irrelevancy of the scale parameter may not carry over into more complex models where more than two choices are available.)

It turns out that this formulation is exactly equivalent to the preceding one, phrased in terms of the generalized linear model and without any latent variables. This can be shown as follows, using the fact that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard logistic distribution is the logistic function, which is the inverse of the logit function, i.e.

:formula_173

Then:

:formula_174

This formulation—which is standard in discrete choice models—makes clear the relationship between logistic regression (the &quot;logit model&quot;) and the probit model, which uses an error variable distributed according to a standard normal distribution instead of a standard logistic distribution. Both the logistic and normal distributions are symmetric with a basic unimodal, &quot;bell curve&quot; shape. The only difference is that the logistic distribution has somewhat heavier tails, which means that it is less sensitive to outlying data (and hence somewhat more robust to model mis-specifications or erroneous data).

===Two-way latent-variable model===
Yet another formulation uses two separate latent variables:

: formula_175

where

: formula_176

where &quot;EV&quot;1(0,1) is a standard type-1 extreme value distribution: i.e.

:formula_177

Then

: formula_178

This model has a separate latent variable and a separate set of regression coefficients for each possible outcome of the dependent variable. The reason for this separation is that it makes it easy to extend logistic regression to multi-outcome categorical variables, as in the multinomial logit model. In such a model, it is natural to model each possible outcome using a different set of regression coefficients. It is also possible to motivate each of the separate latent variables as the theoretical utility associated with making the associated choice, and thus motivate logistic regression in terms of utility theory. (In terms of utility theory, a rational actor always chooses the choice with the greatest associated utility.) This is the approach taken by economists when formulating discrete choice models, because it both provides a theoretically strong foundation and facilitates intuitions about the model, which in turn makes it easy to consider various sorts of extensions. (See the example below.)

The choice of the type-1 extreme value distribution seems fairly arbitrary, but it makes the mathematics work out, and it may be possible to justify its use through rational choice theory.

It turns out that this model is equivalent to the previous model, although this seems non-obvious, since there are now two sets of regression coefficients and error variables, and the error variables have a different distribution. In fact, this model reduces directly to the previous one with the following substitutions:
:formula_179
:formula_180
An intuition for this comes from the fact that, since we choose based on the maximum of two values, only their difference matters, not the exact values — and this effectively removes one degree of freedom. Another critical fact is that the difference of two type-1 extreme-value-distributed variables is a logistic distribution, i.e. formula_181 We can demonstrate the equivalent as follows:

:formula_182

====Example====
As an example, consider a province-level election where the choice is between a right-of-center party, a left-of-center party, and a secessionist party (e.g. the Parti Québécois, which wants Quebec to secede from Canada). We would then use three latent variables, one for each choice. Then, in accordance with utility theory, we can then interpret the latent variables as expressing the utility that results from making each of the choices. We can also interpret the regression coefficients as indicating the strength that the associated factor (i.e. explanatory variable) has in contributing to the utility — or more correctly, the amount by which a unit change in an explanatory variable changes the utility of a given choice. A voter might expect that the right-of-center party would lower taxes, especially on rich people. This would give low-income people no benefit, i.e. no change in utility (since they usually don&#x27;t pay taxes); would cause moderate benefit (i.e. somewhat more money, or moderate utility increase) for middle-incoming people; would cause significant benefits for high-income people. On the other hand, the left-of-center party might be expected to raise taxes and offset it with increased welfare and other assistance for the lower and middle classes. This would cause significant positive benefit to low-income people, perhaps a weak benefit to middle-income people, and significant negative benefit to high-income people. Finally, the secessionist party would take no direct actions on the economy, but simply secede. A low-income or middle-income voter might expect basically no clear utility gain or loss from this, but a high-income voter might expect negative utility since he/she is likely to own companies, which will have a harder time doing business in such an environment and probably lose money.

These intuitions can be expressed as follows:

This clearly shows that
# Separate sets of regression coefficients need to exist for each choice. When phrased in terms of utility, this can be seen very easily. Different choices have different effects on net utility; furthermore, the effects vary in complex ways that depend on the characteristics of each individual, so there need to be separate sets of coefficients for each characteristic, not simply a single extra per-choice characteristic.
# Even though income is a continuous variable, its effect on utility is too complex for it to be treated as a single variable. Either it needs to be directly split up into ranges, or higher powers of income need to be added so that polynomial regression on income is effectively done.

===As a &quot;log-linear&quot; model===
Yet another formulation combines the two-way latent variable formulation above with the original formulation higher up without latent variables, and in the process provides a link to one of the standard formulations of the multinomial logit.

Here, instead of writing the logit of the probabilities &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; as a linear predictor, we separate the linear predictor into two, one for each of the two outcomes:

: formula_183

Two separate sets of regression coefficients have been introduced, just as in the two-way latent variable model, and the two equations appear a form that writes the logarithm of the associated probability as a linear predictor, with an extra term formula_184 at the end. This term, as it turns out, serves as the normalizing factor ensuring that the result is a distribution. This can be seen by exponentiating both sides:

: formula_185

In this form it is clear that the purpose of &quot;Z&quot; is to ensure that the resulting distribution over &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; is in fact a probability distribution, i.e. it sums to 1. This means that &quot;Z&quot; is simply the sum of all un-normalized probabilities, and by dividing each probability by &quot;Z&quot;, the probabilities become &quot;normalized&quot;. That is:

:formula_186

and the resulting equations are

:formula_187

Or generally:

:formula_188

This shows clearly how to generalize this formulation to more than two outcomes, as in multinomial logit.
This general formulation is exactly the softmax function as in

:formula_189

In order to prove that this is equivalent to the previous model, the above model is overspecified, in that formula_190 and formula_191 cannot be independently specified: rather formula_192 so knowing one automatically determines the other. As a result, the model is nonidentifiable, in that multiple combinations of β0 and β1 will produce the same probabilities for all possible explanatory variables. In fact, it can be seen that adding any constant vector to both of them will produce the same probabilities:

:formula_193

As a result, we can simplify matters, and restore identifiability, by picking an arbitrary value for one of the two vectors. We choose to set formula_194 Then,

:formula_195

and so

:formula_196

which shows that this formulation is indeed equivalent to the previous formulation. (As in the two-way latent variable formulation, any settings where formula_179 will produce equivalent results.)

Most treatments of the multinomial logit model start out either by extending the &quot;log-linear&quot; formulation presented here or the two-way latent variable formulation presented above, since both clearly show the way that the model could be extended to multi-way outcomes. In general, the presentation with latent variables is more common in econometrics and political science, where discrete choice models and utility theory reign, while the &quot;log-linear&quot; formulation here is more common in computer science, e.g. machine learning and natural language processing.

===As a single-layer perceptron===
The model has an equivalent formulation

:formula_198

This functional form is commonly called a single-layer perceptron or single-layer artificial neural network. A single-layer neural network computes a continuous output instead of a step function. The derivative of &quot;pi&quot; with respect to &quot;X&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) is computed from the general form:

: formula_199

where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is an analytic function in &quot;X&quot;. With this choice, the single-layer neural network is identical to the logistic regression model. This function has a continuous derivative, which allows it to be used in backpropagation. This function is also preferred because its derivative is easily calculated:

: formula_200

===In terms of binomial data===
A closely related model assumes that each &quot;i&quot; is associated not with a single Bernoulli trial but with &quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; independent identically distributed trials, where the observation &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the number of successes observed (the sum of the individual Bernoulli-distributed random variables), and hence follows a binomial distribution:

:formula_201

An example of this distribution is the fraction of seeds (&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;) that germinate after &quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; are planted.

In terms of expected values, this model is expressed as follows:

:formula_202

so that

:formula_203

Or equivalently:

:formula_204

This model can be fit using the same sorts of methods as the above more basic model.

==Model fitting==
===Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)===

The regression coefficients are usually estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. Unlike linear regression with normally distributed residuals, it is not possible to find a closed-form expression for the coefficient values that maximize the likelihood function so an iterative process must be used instead; for example Newton&#x27;s method. This process begins with a tentative solution, revises it slightly to see if it can be improved, and repeats this revision until no more improvement is made, at which point the process is said to have converged.

In some instances, the model may not reach convergence. Non-convergence of a model indicates that the coefficients are not meaningful because the iterative process was unable to find appropriate solutions. A failure to converge may occur for a number of reasons: having a large ratio of predictors to cases, multicollinearity, sparseness, or complete separation.
* Having a large ratio of variables to cases results in an overly conservative Wald statistic (discussed below) and can lead to non-convergence. Regularized logistic regression is specifically intended to be used in this situation.
* Multicollinearity refers to unacceptably high correlations between predictors. As multicollinearity increases, coefficients remain unbiased but standard errors increase and the likelihood of model convergence decreases. To detect multicollinearity amongst the predictors, one can conduct a linear regression analysis with the predictors of interest for the sole purpose of examining the tolerance statistic used to assess whether multicollinearity is unacceptably high.
* Sparseness in the data refers to having a large proportion of empty cells (cells with zero counts). Zero cell counts are particularly problematic with categorical predictors. With continuous predictors, the model can infer values for the zero cell counts, but this is not the case with categorical predictors. The model will not converge with zero cell counts for categorical predictors because the natural logarithm of zero is an undefined value so that the final solution to the model cannot be reached. To remedy this problem, researchers may collapse categories in a theoretically meaningful way or add a constant to all cells.
* Another numerical problem that may lead to a lack of convergence is complete separation, which refers to the instance in which the predictors perfectly predict the criterion – all cases are accurately classified and the likelihood maximized with infinite coefficients. In such instances, one should re-examine the data, as there may be some kind of error.
* One can also take semi-parametric or non-parametric approaches, e.g., via local-likelihood or nonparametric quasi-likelihood methods, which avoid assumptions of a parametric form for the index function and is robust to the choice of the link function (e.g., probit or logit).

=== Iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) ===

Binary logistic regression (formula_205 or formula_206) can, for example, be calculated using &quot;iteratively reweighted least squares&quot; (IRLS), which is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood of a Bernoulli distributed process using Newton&#x27;s method. If the problem is written in vector matrix form, with parameters formula_207, explanatory variables formula_208 and expected value of the Bernoulli distribution formula_209, the parameters formula_210 can be found using the following iterative algorithm:

:formula_211

where formula_212 is a diagonal weighting matrix, formula_213 the vector of expected values,

:formula_214

The regressor matrix and formula_215 the vector of response variables. More details can be found in the literature.

===Bayesian===
In a Bayesian statistics context, prior distributions are normally placed on the regression coefficients, for example in the form of Gaussian distributions. There is no conjugate prior of the likelihood function in logistic regression. When Bayesian inference was performed analytically, this made the posterior distribution difficult to calculate except in very low dimensions. Now, though, automatic software such as OpenBUGS, JAGS, PyMC, Stan or Turing.jl allows these posteriors to be computed using simulation, so lack of conjugacy is not a concern. However, when the sample size or the number of parameters is large, full Bayesian simulation can be slow, and people often use approximate methods such as variational Bayesian methods and expectation propagation.

===&quot;Rule of ten&quot;===
Widely used, the &quot;one in ten rule&quot;, states that logistic regression models give stable values for the explanatory variables if based on a minimum of about 10 events per explanatory variable (EPV); where &quot;event&quot; denotes the cases belonging to the less frequent category in the dependent variable. Thus a study designed to use formula_216 explanatory variables for an event (e.g. myocardial infarction) expected to occur in a proportion formula_217 of participants in the study will require a total of formula_218 participants. However, there is considerable debate about the reliability of this rule, which is based on simulation studies and lacks a secure theoretical underpinning. According to some authors the rule is overly conservative in some circumstances, with the authors stating, &quot;If we (somewhat subjectively) regard confidence interval coverage less than 93 percent, type I error greater than 7 percent, or relative bias greater than 15 percent as problematic, our results indicate that problems are fairly frequent with 2–4 EPV, uncommon with 5–9 EPV, and still observed with 10–16 EPV. The worst instances of each problem were not severe with 5–9 EPV and usually comparable to those with 10–16 EPV&quot;.

Others have found results that are not consistent with the above, using different criteria. A useful criterion is whether the fitted model will be expected to achieve the same predictive discrimination in a new sample as it appeared to achieve in the model development sample. For that criterion, 20 events per candidate variable may be required. Also, one can argue that 96 observations are needed only to estimate the model&#x27;s intercept precisely enough that the margin of error in predicted probabilities is ±0.1 with a 0.95 confidence level.

== Error and significance of fit ==

=== Deviance and likelihood ratio test ─ a simple case ===
In any fitting procedure, the addition of another fitting parameter to a model (e.g. the beta parameters in a logistic regression model) will almost always improve the ability of the model to predict the measured outcomes. This will be true even if the additional term has no predictive value, since the model will simply be &quot;overfitting&quot; to the noise in the data. The question arises as to whether the improvement gained by the addition of another fitting parameter is significant enough to recommend the inclusion of the additional term, or whether the improvement is simply that which may be expected from overfitting.

In short, for logistic regression, a statistic known as the deviance is defined which is a measure of the error between the logistic model fit and the outcome data. In the limit of a large number of data points, the deviance is chi-squared distributed, which allows a chi-squared test to be implemented in order to determine the significance of the explanatory variables.

Linear regression and logistic regression have many similarities. For example, in simple linear regression, a set of &quot;K&quot; data points (&quot;xk&quot;, &quot;yk&quot;) are fitted to a proposed model function of the form formula_219. The fit is obtained by choosing the &quot;b&quot; parameters which minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals (the squared error term) for each data point:

:formula_220

The minimum value which constitutes the fit will be denoted by formula_221

The idea of a null model may be introduced, in which it is assumed that the &quot;x&quot; variable is of no use in predicting the yk outcomes: The data points are fitted to a null model function of the form &quot;y&quot; = &quot;b&quot;0 with a squared error term:

:formula_222

The fitting process consists of choosing a value of &quot;b&quot;0 which minimizes formula_223 of the fit to the null model, denoted by formula_224 where the formula_225 subscript denotes the null model. It is seen that the null model is optimized by formula_226 where formula_227 is the mean of the &quot;yk&quot; values, and the optimized formula_224 is:

:formula_229

which is proportional to the square of the (uncorrected) sample standard deviation of the &quot;yk&quot; data points.

We can imagine a case where the &quot;yk&quot; data points are randomly assigned to the various &quot;xk&quot;, and then fitted using the proposed model. Specifically, we can consider the fits of the proposed model to every permutation of the &quot;yk&quot; outcomes. It can be shown that the optimized error of any of these fits will never be less than the optimum error of the null model, and that the difference between these minimum error will follow a chi-squared distribution, with degrees of freedom equal those of the proposed model minus those of the null model which, in this case, will be formula_230. Using the chi-squared test, we may then estimate how many of these permuted sets of &quot;yk&quot; will yield a minimum error less than or equal to the minimum error using the original &quot;yk&quot;, and so we can estimate how significant an improvement is given by the inclusion of the &quot;x&quot; variable in the proposed model.

For logistic regression, the measure of goodness-of-fit is the likelihood function &quot;L&quot;, or its logarithm, the log-likelihood &quot;ℓ&quot;. The likelihood function &quot;L&quot; is analogous to the formula_223 in the linear regression case, except that the likelihood is maximized rather than minimized. Denote the maximized log-likelihood of the proposed model by formula_232.

In the case of simple binary logistic regression, the set of &quot;K&quot; data points are fitted in a probabilistic sense to a function of the form:

:formula_233

where is the probability that formula_88. The log-odds are given by:

:formula_235

and the log-likelihood is:

:formula_236

For the null model, the probability that formula_88 is given by:

:formula_238

The log-odds for the null model are given by:

:formula_239

and the log-likelihood is:

:formula_240 

Since we have formula_241 at the maximum of &quot;L&quot;, the maximum log-likelihood for the null model is

:formula_242

The optimum formula_65 is:

:formula_244

where formula_227 is again the mean of the &quot;yk&quot; values. Again, we can conceptually consider the fit of the proposed model to every permutation of the &quot;yk&quot; and it can be shown that the maximum log-likelihood of these permutation fits will never be smaller than that of the null model:

:formula_246

Also, as an analog to the error of the linear regression case, we may define the deviance of a logistic regression fit as:

:formula_247

which will always be positive or zero. The reason for this choice is that not only is the deviance a good measure of the goodness of fit, it is also approximately chi-squared distributed, with the approximation improving as the number of data points (&quot;K&quot;) increases, becoming exactly chi-square distributed in the limit of an infinite number of data points. As in the case of linear regression, we may use this fact to estimate the probability that a random set of data points will give a better fit than the fit obtained by the proposed model, and so have an estimate how significantly the model is improved by including the &quot;xk&quot; data points in the proposed model.

For the simple model of student test scores described above, the maximum value of the log-likelihood of the null model is formula_248 The maximum value of the log-likelihood for the simple model is formula_249 so that the deviance is formula_250

Using the chi-squared test of significance, the integral of the chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom from 11.6661... to infinity is equal to 0.00063649...

This effectively means that about 6 out of a 10,000 fits to random &quot;yk&quot; can be expected to have a better fit (smaller deviance) than the given &quot;yk&quot; and so we can conclude that the inclusion of the &quot;x&quot; variable and data in the proposed model is a very significant improvement over the null model. In other words, we reject the null hypothesis with formula_251 confidence.

===Goodness of fit summary===

Goodness of fit in linear regression models is generally measured using R2. Since this has no direct analog in logistic regression, various methods including the following can be used instead.

====Deviance and likelihood ratio tests====
In linear regression analysis, one is concerned with partitioning variance via the sum of squares calculations – variance in the criterion is essentially divided into variance accounted for by the predictors and residual variance. In logistic regression analysis, deviance is used in lieu of a sum of squares calculations. Deviance is analogous to the sum of squares calculations in linear regression and is a measure of the lack of fit to the data in a logistic regression model. When a &quot;saturated&quot; model is available (a model with a theoretically perfect fit), deviance is calculated by comparing a given model with the saturated model. This computation gives the likelihood-ratio test:

:formula_252

In the above equation, represents the deviance and ln represents the natural logarithm. The log of this likelihood ratio (the ratio of the fitted model to the saturated model) will produce a negative value, hence the need for a negative sign. can be shown to follow an approximate chi-squared distribution. Smaller values indicate better fit as the fitted model deviates less from the saturated model. When assessed upon a chi-square distribution, nonsignificant chi-square values indicate very little unexplained variance and thus, good model fit. Conversely, a significant chi-square value indicates that a significant amount of the variance is unexplained.

When the saturated model is not available (a common case), deviance is calculated simply as −2·(log likelihood of the fitted model), and the reference to the saturated model&#x27;s log likelihood can be removed from all that follows without harm.

Two measures of deviance are particularly important in logistic regression: null deviance and model deviance. The null deviance represents the difference between a model with only the intercept (which means &quot;no predictors&quot;) and the saturated model. The model deviance represents the difference between a model with at least one predictor and the saturated model. In this respect, the null model provides a baseline upon which to compare predictor models. Given that deviance is a measure of the difference between a given model and the saturated model, smaller values indicate better fit. Thus, to assess the contribution of a predictor or set of predictors, one can subtract the model deviance from the null deviance and assess the difference on a formula_253 chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters estimated.

Let

:formula_254

Then the difference of both is:

:formula_255

If the model deviance is significantly smaller than the null deviance then one can conclude that the predictor or set of predictors significantly improve the model&#x27;s fit. This is analogous to the -test used in linear regression analysis to assess the significance of prediction.

====Pseudo-R-squared====

In linear regression the squared multiple correlation, 2 is used to assess goodness of fit as it represents the proportion of variance in the criterion that is explained by the predictors. In logistic regression analysis, there is no agreed upon analogous measure, but there are several competing measures each with limitations.

Four of the most commonly used indices and one less commonly used one are examined on this page:
* Likelihood ratio 2
* Cox and Snell 2
* Nagelkerke 2
* McFadden 2
* Tjur 2

====Hosmer–Lemeshow test====
The Hosmer–Lemeshow test uses a test statistic that asymptotically follows a formula_256 distribution to assess whether or not the observed event rates match expected event rates in subgroups of the model population. This test is considered to be obsolete by some statisticians because of its dependence on arbitrary binning of predicted probabilities and relative low power.

===Coefficient significance===
After fitting the model, it is likely that researchers will want to examine the contribution of individual predictors. To do so, they will want to examine the regression coefficients. In linear regression, the regression coefficients represent the change in the criterion for each unit change in the predictor. In logistic regression, however, the regression coefficients represent the change in the logit for each unit change in the predictor. Given that the logit is not intuitive, researchers are likely to focus on a predictor&#x27;s effect on the exponential function of the regression coefficient – the odds ratio (see definition). In linear regression, the significance of a regression coefficient is assessed by computing a &quot;t&quot; test. In logistic regression, there are several different tests designed to assess the significance of an individual predictor, most notably the likelihood ratio test and the Wald statistic.

====Likelihood ratio test====
The likelihood-ratio test discussed above to assess model fit is also the recommended procedure to assess the contribution of individual &quot;predictors&quot; to a given model. In the case of a single predictor model, one simply compares the deviance of the predictor model with that of the null model on a chi-square distribution with a single degree of freedom. If the predictor model has significantly smaller deviance (c.f. chi-square using the difference in degrees of freedom of the two models), then one can conclude that there is a significant association between the &quot;predictor&quot; and the outcome. Although some common statistical packages (e.g. SPSS) do provide likelihood ratio test statistics, without this computationally intensive test it would be more difficult to assess the contribution of individual predictors in the multiple logistic regression case. To assess the contribution of individual predictors one can enter the predictors hierarchically, comparing each new model with the previous to determine the contribution of each predictor. There is some debate among statisticians about the appropriateness of so-called &quot;stepwise&quot; procedures. The fear is that they may not preserve nominal statistical properties and may become misleading.

====Wald statistic====
Alternatively, when assessing the contribution of individual predictors in a given model, one may examine the significance of the Wald statistic. The Wald statistic, analogous to the &quot;t&quot;-test in linear regression, is used to assess the significance of coefficients. The Wald statistic is the ratio of the square of the regression coefficient to the square of the standard error of the coefficient and is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square distribution.

: formula_257

Although several statistical packages (e.g., SPSS, SAS) report the Wald statistic to assess the contribution of individual predictors, the Wald statistic has limitations. When the regression coefficient is large, the standard error of the regression coefficient also tends to be larger increasing the probability of Type-II error. The Wald statistic also tends to be biased when data are sparse.

====Case-control sampling====
Suppose cases are rare. Then we might wish to sample them more frequently than their prevalence in the population. For example, suppose there is a disease that affects 1 person in 10,000 and to collect our data we need to do a complete physical. It may be too expensive to do thousands of physicals of healthy people in order to obtain data for only a few diseased individuals. Thus, we may evaluate more diseased individuals, perhaps all of the rare outcomes. This is also retrospective sampling, or equivalently it is called unbalanced data. As a rule of thumb, sampling controls at a rate of five times the number of cases will produce sufficient control data.

Logistic regression is unique in that it may be estimated on unbalanced data, rather than randomly sampled data, and still yield correct coefficient estimates of the effects of each independent variable on the outcome. That is to say, if we form a logistic model from such data, if the model is correct in the general population, the formula_258 parameters are all correct except for formula_65. We can correct formula_65 if we know the true prevalence as follows:

: formula_261

where formula_262 is the true prevalence and formula_263 is the prevalence in the sample.

==Discussion==
Like other forms of regression analysis, logistic regression makes use of one or more predictor variables that may be either continuous or categorical. Unlike ordinary linear regression, however, logistic regression is used for predicting dependent variables that take membership in one of a limited number of categories (treating the dependent variable in the binomial case as the outcome of a Bernoulli trial) rather than a continuous outcome. Given this difference, the assumptions of linear regression are violated. In particular, the residuals cannot be normally distributed. In addition, linear regression may make nonsensical predictions for a binary dependent variable. What is needed is a way to convert a binary variable into a continuous one that can take on any real value (negative or positive). To do that, binomial logistic regression first calculates the odds of the event happening for different levels of each independent variable, and then takes its logarithm to create a continuous criterion as a transformed version of the dependent variable. The logarithm of the odds is the of the probability, the is defined as follows:
formula_264

 is the Bernoulli-distributed response variable and is the predictor variable; the values are the linear parameters.

The of the probability of success is then fitted to the predictors. The predicted value of the is converted back into predicted odds, via the inverse of the natural logarithm – the exponential function. Thus, although the observed dependent variable in binary logistic regression is a 0-or-1 variable, the logistic regression estimates the odds, as a continuous variable, that the dependent variable is a &#x27;success&#x27;. In some applications, the odds are all that is needed. In others, a specific yes-or-no prediction is needed for whether the dependent variable is or is not a &#x27;success&#x27;; this categorical prediction can be based on the computed odds of success, with predicted odds above some chosen cutoff value being translated into a prediction of success.

== Maximum entropy ==

Of all the functional forms used for estimating the probabilities of a particular categorical outcome which optimize the fit by maximizing the likelihood function (e.g. probit regression, Poisson regression, etc.), the logistic regression solution is unique in that it is a maximum entropy solution. This is a case of a general property: an exponential family of distributions maximizes entropy, given an expected value. In the case of the logistic model, the logistic function is the natural parameter of the Bernoulli distribution (it is in &quot;canonical form&quot;, and the logistic function is the canonical link function), while other sigmoid functions are non-canonical link functions; this underlies its mathematical elegance and ease of optimization. See for details.

=== Proof ===

In order to show this, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is equal to the entropy plus the sum of the products of Lagrange multipliers times various constraint expressions. The general multinomial case will be considered, since the proof is not made that much simpler by considering simpler cases. Equating the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the various probabilities to zero yields a functional form for those probabilities which corresponds to those used in logistic regression.

As in the above section on multinomial logistic regression, we will consider explanatory variables denoted and which include formula_265. There will be a total of &quot;K&quot; data points, indexed by formula_266, and the data points are given by formula_163 and . The &quot;xmk&quot; will also be represented as an -dimensional vector formula_268. There will be possible values of the categorical variable &quot;y&quot; ranging from 0 to N.

Let &quot;pn(x)&quot; be the probability, given explanatory variable vector x, that the outcome will be formula_269. Define formula_270 which is the probability that for the &quot;k&quot;-th measurement, the categorical outcome is &quot;n&quot;.

The Lagrangian will be expressed as a function of the probabilities &quot;pnk&quot; and will minimized by equating the derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to these probabilities to zero. An important point is that the probabilities are treated equally and the fact that they sum to 1 is part of the Lagrangian formulation, rather than being assumed from the beginning.

The first contribution to the Lagrangian is the entropy:

:formula_271

The log-likelihood is:

:formula_272

Assuming the multinomial logistic function, the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect the beta coefficients was found to be:

:formula_273

A very important point here is that this expression is (remarkably) not an explicit function of the beta coefficients. It is only a function of the probabilities &quot;pnk&quot; and the data. Rather than being specific to the assumed multinomial logistic case, it is taken to be a general statement of the condition at which the log-likelihood is maximized and makes no reference to the functional form of &quot;pnk&quot;. There are then (&quot;M&quot;+1)(&quot;N&quot;+1) fitting constraints and the fitting constraint term in the Lagrangian is then:

:formula_274

where the &quot;λnm&quot; are the appropriate Lagrange multipliers. There are &quot;K&quot; normalization constraints which may be written:

:formula_275

so that the normalization term in the Lagrangian is:

:formula_276

where the &quot;αk&quot; are the appropriate Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is then the sum of the above three terms:

:formula_277

Setting the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to one of the probabilities to zero yields:

:formula_278

Using the more condensed vector notation:

:formula_279

and dropping the primes on the &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot; indices, and then solving for formula_280 yields:

:formula_281

where:

:formula_282

Imposing the normalization constraint, we can solve for the &quot;Zk&quot; and write the probabilities as:

:formula_283

The formula_284 are not all independent. We can add any constant -dimensional vector to each of the formula_284 without changing the value of the formula_280 probabilities so that there are only &quot;N&quot; rather than independent formula_284. In the multinomial logistic regression section above, the formula_288 was subtracted from each formula_284 which set the exponential term involving formula_288 to 1, and the beta coefficients were given by formula_291.

===Other approaches===

In machine learning applications where logistic regression is used for binary classification, the MLE minimises the cross-entropy loss function.

Logistic regression is an important machine learning algorithm. The goal is to model the probability of a random variable formula_50 being 0 or 1 given experimental data.

Consider a generalized linear model function parameterized by formula_293,
:formula_294

Therefore,
:formula_295
and since formula_296, we see that formula_297 is given by formula_298 We now calculate the likelihood function assuming that all the observations in the sample are independently Bernoulli distributed,
:formula_299

Typically, the log likelihood is maximized,
:formula_300
which is maximized using optimization techniques such as gradient descent.

Assuming the formula_301 pairs are drawn uniformly from the underlying distribution, then in the limit of large &quot;N&quot;,
:formula_302
where formula_303 is the conditional entropy and formula_304 is the Kullback–Leibler divergence. This leads to the intuition that by maximizing the log-likelihood of a model, you are minimizing the KL divergence of your model from the maximal entropy distribution. Intuitively searching for the model that makes the fewest assumptions in its parameters.

==Comparison with linear regression==
Logistic regression can be seen as a special case of the generalized linear model and thus analogous to linear regression. The model of logistic regression, however, is based on quite different assumptions (about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables) from those of linear regression. In particular, the key differences between these two models can be seen in the following two features of logistic regression. First, the conditional distribution formula_305 is a Bernoulli distribution rather than a Gaussian distribution, because the dependent variable is binary. Second, the predicted values are probabilities and are therefore restricted to (0,1) through the logistic distribution function because logistic regression predicts the probability of particular outcomes rather than the outcomes themselves.

==Alternatives==
A common alternative to the logistic model (logit model) is the probit model, as the related names suggest. From the perspective of generalized linear models, these differ in the choice of link function: the logistic model uses the logit function (inverse logistic function), while the probit model uses the probit function (inverse error function). Equivalently, in the latent variable interpretations of these two methods, the first assumes a standard logistic distribution of errors and the second a standard normal distribution of errors. Other sigmoid functions or error distributions can be used instead.

Logistic regression is an alternative to Fisher&#x27;s 1936 method, linear discriminant analysis. If the assumptions of linear discriminant analysis hold, the conditioning can be reversed to produce logistic regression. The converse is not true, however, because logistic regression does not require the multivariate normal assumption of discriminant analysis.

The assumption of linear predictor effects can easily be relaxed using techniques such as spline functions.

==History==
A detailed history of the logistic regression is given in . The logistic function was developed as a model of population growth and named &quot;logistic&quot; by Pierre François Verhulst in the 1830s and 1840s, under the guidance of Adolphe Quetelet; see for details. In his earliest paper (1838), Verhulst did not specify how he fit the curves to the data. In his more detailed paper (1845), Verhulst determined the three parameters of the model by making the curve pass through three observed points, which yielded poor predictions.

The logistic function was independently developed in chemistry as a model of autocatalysis (Wilhelm Ostwald, 1883). An autocatalytic reaction is one in which one of the products is itself a catalyst for the same reaction, while the supply of one of the reactants is fixed. This naturally gives rise to the logistic equation for the same reason as population growth: the reaction is self-reinforcing but constrained.

The logistic function was independently rediscovered as a model of population growth in 1920 by Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed, published as , which led to its use in modern statistics. They were initially unaware of Verhulst&#x27;s work and presumably learned about it from L. Gustave du Pasquier, but they gave him little credit and did not adopt his terminology. Verhulst&#x27;s priority was acknowledged and the term &quot;logistic&quot; revived by Udny Yule in 1925 and has been followed since. Pearl and Reed first applied the model to the population of the United States, and also initially fitted the curve by making it pass through three points; as with Verhulst, this again yielded poor results.

In the 1930s, the probit model was developed and systematized by Chester Ittner Bliss, who coined the term &quot;probit&quot; in , and by John Gaddum in , and the model fit by maximum likelihood estimation by Ronald A. Fisher in , as an addendum to Bliss&#x27;s work. The probit model was principally used in bioassay, and had been preceded by earlier work dating to 1860; see . The probit model influenced the subsequent development of the logit model and these models competed with each other.

The logistic model was likely first used as an alternative to the probit model in bioassay by Edwin Bidwell Wilson and his student Jane Worcester in . However, the development of the logistic model as a general alternative to the probit model was principally due to the work of Joseph Berkson over many decades, beginning in , where he coined &quot;logit&quot;, by analogy with &quot;probit&quot;, and continuing through and following years. The logit model was initially dismissed as inferior to the probit model, but &quot;gradually achieved an equal footing with the probit&quot;, particularly between 1960 and 1970. By 1970, the logit model achieved parity with the probit model in use in statistics journals and thereafter surpassed it. This relative popularity was due to the adoption of the logit outside of bioassay, rather than displacing the probit within bioassay, and its informal use in practice; the logit&#x27;s popularity is credited to the logit model&#x27;s computational simplicity, mathematical properties, and generality, allowing its use in varied fields.

Various refinements occurred during that time, notably by David Cox, as in .

The multinomial logit model was introduced independently in and , which greatly increased the scope of application and the popularity of the logit model. In 1973 Daniel McFadden linked the multinomial logit to the theory of discrete choice, specifically Luce&#x27;s choice axiom, showing that the multinomial logit followed from the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives and interpreting odds of alternatives as relative preferences; this gave a theoretical foundation for the logistic regression.

==Extensions==
There are large numbers of extensions:
* Multinomial logistic regression (or multinomial logit) handles the case of a multi-way categorical dependent variable (with unordered values, also called &quot;classification&quot;). The general case of having dependent variables with more than two values is termed &quot;polytomous regression&quot;.
* Ordered logistic regression (or ordered logit) handles ordinal dependent variables (ordered values).
* Mixed logit is an extension of multinomial logit that allows for correlations among the choices of the dependent variable.
* An extension of the logistic model to sets of interdependent variables is the conditional random field.
* Conditional logistic regression handles matched or stratified data when the strata are small. It is mostly used in the analysis of observational studies.

<doc id="226636" wikidata="Q1971926" url="?curid=226636" title="SIMPLE (instant messaging protocol)">
<text>SIMPLE, the Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions, is an instant messaging (IM) and presence protocol suite based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force. 

==Purpose==
SIMPLE applies SIP to the problems of:
* registering for presence information and receiving notifications when such events occur, for example when a user logs in or comes back from lunch;
* sending short messages, analogous to SMS or two-way paging;
* managing a session of real-time messages between two or more participants.

Implementations of the SIMPLE based protocols can be found in SIP Softphones and also in SIP Hardphones.

==Technical description==

===Presence===
The SIMPLE presence specifications can be broken up into:
* The core protocol machinery. This provides the actual SIP extensions for subscriptions, notifications and publications. RFC 6665 defines the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods. SUBSCRIBE allows users to subscribe to an event on a server, the server responds with NOTIFY whenever the event occurs. RFC 3856 defines how to make use of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY for presence. Two models are defined: an end-to-end model in which each User Agent handles presence subscriptions itself; and a centralized model. The latter introduces the concept of a presence server; all subscriptions are handled by this server. The message PUBLISH (RFC 3903) allows User Agents to inform the presence server about their subscription states.
* Presence documents. The presence information is coded in XML documents, that are carried in the bodies of the respective SIP messages. RFC 3863 and RFC 4479 describe this procedure, RFC 4480 (RPID), RFC 4481, RFC 4482 (CPID) and various drafts describe contents and formats of the presence documents.
* Privacy, policy and provisioning. If the centralized model is used, the User Agents need a way to define who may subscribe to which amount of their presence information. RFC 4745 and RFC 5025 define a framework for authorization policies controlling access to application-specific data. The XCAP (RFC 4825), carried by HTTP, allows User Agents to communicate their presence rules to a XCAP server, which rules the information exposed by the presence server. RFC 3857 and RFC 3858 define a subscription event &quot;watcher info&quot;. User Agents may subscribe to this event to be informed who is subscribing to their presence information.

===IM===
SIP defines two modes of instant messaging:
* The Page Mode makes use of the SIP method MESSAGE, as defined in RFC 3428. This mode establishes no sessions.
* The Session Mode. The Message Session Relay Protocol (RFC 4975, RFC 4976) is a text-based protocol for exchanging arbitrarily-sized content between users, at any time. An MSRP session is set up by exchanging certain information, such as an MSRP URI, within SIP and SDP signalling.

<doc id="226644" wikidata="Q11878049" url="?curid=226644" title="Unit cell">
<text>In geometry, biology, mineralogy and solid state physics, a unit cell is a repeating unit formed by the vectors spanning the points of a lattice. Despite its suggestive name, the unit cell (unlike a unit vector, for example) does not necessarily have unit size, or even a particular size at all. Rather, the primitive cell is the closest analogy to a unit vector, since it has a determined size for a given lattice and is the basic building block from which larger cells are constructed.

The concept is used particularly in describing crystal structure in two and three dimensions, though it makes sense in all dimensions. A lattice can be characterized by the geometry of its unit cell, which is a section of the tiling (a parallelogram or parallelepiped) that generates the whole tiling using only translations.

There are two special cases of the unit cell: the primitive cell and the conventional cell. The primitive cell is a unit cell corresponding to a single lattice point, it is the smallest possible unit cell. In some cases, the full symmetry of a crystal structure is not obvious from the primitive cell, in which cases a conventional cell may be used. A conventional cell (which may or may not be primitive) is a unit cell with the full symmetry of the lattice and may include more than one lattice point. The conventional unit cells are parallelotopes in &quot;n&quot; dimensions.

==Primitive cell==
A primitive cell is a unit cell that contains exactly one lattice point. For unit cells generally, lattice points that are shared by cells are counted as of the lattice points contained in each of those cells; so for example a primitive unit cell in three dimensions which has lattice points only at its eight vertices is considered to contain of each of them. An alternative conceptualization is to consistently pick only one of the lattice points to belong to the given unit cell (so the other lattice points belong to adjacent unit cells).

The &quot;primitive translation vectors&quot; , , span a lattice cell of smallest volume for a particular three-dimensional lattice, and are used to define a crystal translation vector

:formula_1

where , , are integers, translation by which leaves the lattice invariant. That is, for a point in the lattice , the arrangement of points appears the same from as from .

Since the primitive cell is defined by the primitive axes (vectors) , , , the volume of the primitive cell is given by the parallelepiped from the above axes as

: formula_2

Usually, primitive cells in two and three dimensions are chosen to take the shape parallelograms and parallelepipeds, with an atom at each corner of the cell. This choice of primitive cell is not unique, but volume of primitive cells will always be given by the expression above. 

===Wigner–Seitz cell===

In addition to the parallelepiped primitive cells, for every Bravais lattice there is another kind of primitive cell called the Wigner–Seitz cell. In the Wigner–Seitz cell, the lattice point is at the center of the cell, and for most Bravais lattices, the shape is not a parallelogram or parallelepiped. This is a type of Voronoi cell. The Wigner–Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice in momentum space is called the Brillouin zone.

== Conventional cell ==
For each particular lattice, a conventional cell has been chosen on a case-by-case basis by crystallographers based on convenience of calculation. These conventional cells may have additional lattice points located in the middle of the faces or body of the unit cell. The number of lattice points, as well as the volume of the conventional cell is an integer multiple (1, 2, 3, or 4) of that of the primitive cell.

==Two dimensions==

For any 2-dimensional lattice, the unit cells are parallelograms, which in special cases may have orthogonal angles, equal lengths, or both. Four of the five two-dimensional Bravais lattices are represented using conventional primitive cells, as shown below. 

The centered rectangular lattice also has a primitive cell in the shape of a rhombus, but in order to allow easy discrimination on the basis of symmetry, it is represented by a conventional cell which contains two lattice points.

==Three dimensions==

For any 3-dimensional lattice, the conventional unit cells are parallelepipeds, which in special cases may have orthogonal angles, or equal lengths, or both. Seven of the fourteen three-dimensional Bravais lattices are represented using conventional primitive cells, as shown below. 

The other seven Bravais lattices (known as the centered lattices) also have primitive cells in the shape of a parallelepiped, but in order to allow easy discrimination on the basis of symmetry, they are represented by conventional cells which contain more than one lattice point.

<doc id="226647" wikidata="Q1020251" url="?curid=226647" title="Dunoon">
<text>Dunoon (; ) is the main town on the Cowal Peninsula in the south of Argyll and Bute, west of Scotland. It is located on the western shore of the upper Firth of Clyde, to the south of the Holy Loch and to the north of Innellan. As well as forming part of the council area of Argyll and Bute, Dunoon also has its own community council. Dunoon was a burgh until 1976.

The early history of Dunoon often revolves around two feuding clans: the Lamonts and the Campbells. The town was a popular destination when travel by steamships was common around the Firth of Clyde; Glaswegians described this as going &quot;doon the watter&quot;. This diminished, and many holidaymakers started to go elsewhere as roads and railways improved and the popularity of overseas travel increased.

In 1961, during the height of the Cold War, Dunoon became a garrison town to the United States Navy. In 1992, shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, they closed their Holy Loch base in Sandbank, and neighbouring Dunoon suffered an economic downturn. Since the base&#x27;s closure, the town and surrounding area are again turning to tourism, marketing to outdoor enthusiasts and wildlife lovers, as well as promoting festivals and competitions. The largest annual event held in the town is the Cowal Highland Gathering, which has been held since 1894. The Royal National Mòd has also been held in the town.

==History==

Dunoon Castle was built on a small, partly artificial, conical hill beside the Firth of Clyde in the 12th century, of which low walls remain. It eventually became a royal castle with the Earls of Argyll (Campbells) as hereditary keepers, paying a nominal rent of a single red rose to the sovereign. Mary, Queen of Scots, visited Dunoon Castle on 26 July 1563 and granted several charters during her visit. In 1646 the Dunoon massacre of members of Clan Lamont by members of Clan Campbell took place. The castle was destroyed during Argyll&#x27;s Rising, a rebellion in 1685 against James VII.

In the early 19th century, the town&#x27;s main street, Argyll Street, stopped at Moir Street. Instead of continuing to Dunoon Pier, it turned right at today&#x27;s Sinbad&#x27;s Bar. Before Dunoon Burgh Hall was built, beginning in 1873, the land was an open field, owned by James MacArthur Moir, leading to an area known as the Gallowhill. There were no streets and houses between Argyll Street and Edward Street. Argyll Street, roughly as it is seen today, was completed by 1870. Moir donated some of his land for the building of the Burgh Hall, but he did not get to see its completion; he died by suicide in 1872.

The two banks mentioned above were the Union Bank of Scotland and the City of Glasgow Bank. The hydropathic spa, meanwhile, was &quot;an elegant new baths building, named Ardvullin, erected a little to the north of the village as a hydropathic establishment, where baths - hot, cold, artificial salt, and Turkish — may be had at moderate charges.&quot;

Many of the town&#x27;s early villas had their own private bathing ground or boxes.

The population of the united parishes of Dunoon and Kilmun in 1861 was 5,444; in 1866 the estimated population of Dunoon, from Baugie Burn to Hunters Quay, was 3,000.

During the World Wars, as the main part of the Firth of Clyde defences, the Cloch Point-to-Dunoon anti-submarine boom was anchored to the shore in Dunoon below Castle Hill. A Palmerston Fort and camp at Ardhallow Battery in the south of the town provided one of the coastal defence gun emplacements that covered the anti-submarine boom and Firth of Clyde waters. There also was a gun emplacement atop Castle Hill.

In 1961, as the Cold War intensified, the Holy Loch&#x27;s importance grew when the U.S. Navy submarine tender USS &quot;Proteus&quot; brought Polaris ballistic missiles, nuclear submarines to the Firth of Clyde at Sandbank. Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament protesters drew this to the public&#x27;s attention. Holy Loch was, for thirty years, the home port of U.S. Navy Submarine Squadron 14 and Dunoon, therefore, became a garrison town.

In 1991, the Holy Loch base was deemed unnecessary following the demise of the Soviet Union and was subsequently withdrawn. The last submarine tender to be based there, the USS &quot;Simon Lake&quot;, left Holy Loch in March 1992, leading to a major and continuing downturn in the local economy.

In May 2012, Dunoon and Campbeltown were jointly named as the rural places in Scotland most vulnerable to a downturn in a report by the Scottish Agricultural College looking at ninety places.

==Government and politics==
Dunoon is represented in the Scottish Parliament by Jenni Minto, of the Scottish National Party (SNP), who holds the Argyll and Bute seat. Dunoon also lies within the Highlands and Islands electoral region, from which a further seven additional members are elected to produce a form of proportional representation for the region as a whole.

In the House of Commons, Dunoon is represented by the SNP&#x27;s Brendan O&#x27;Hara, who holds a seat also titled Argyll and Bute, although this seat has different boundaries from the one used for the Scottish Parliament.

Argyll and Bute Council is the Local Authority for the council area covering Dunoon. It is one of 32 such council areas across Scotland. Dunoon forms a single ward for elections to Argyll and Bute Council, electing three councillors via the single transferable vote system. At the last election, held in May 2017, one independent and one member from each of the SNP and the Conservatives was elected to represent the town.

Dunoon has a community council, whose primary role is to represent the views of the community to the Local Authority and other public bodies.

There are a number of churches in Dunoon, including:

Church of Scotland: St John&#x27;s Church

===Historical===

There is evidence of an episcopal seat at Dunoon from the latter part of the 15th century. No remains of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace now exist, the site is now occupied by the playground of Dunoon Primary School, between Hillfoot Street and Kirk Street.

===Architecture===
====Dunoon Pier====

Dunoon&#x27;s Victorian pier was extended to the current structure between 1896 and 1898. It was shortened to allow the building of a breakwater in 2005, just to the south of the pier. As well as protecting the pier and its architecture from storm surges, a new link span was installed alongside the breakwater. This was to allow the berthing and loading of roll-on/roll-off ferries instead of the side-loading ferries that used to serve the pier. A tender to serve the new link-span between two interested parties, Caledonian MacBrayne and Western Ferries, came to nothing. Prior to June 2011, the pier was in daily use by Caledonian MacBrayne, who ran a regular foot passenger and car-ferry service to Gourock. However, after June 2011, a renewed tendering process produced a passenger-only ferry service (Argyll Ferries, owned by Caledonian MacBrayne) using the breakwater for berthing. On 1 September 2004, during the construction of the breakwater, the cargo vessel Jackie Moon (82 metres in length) ran aground on the breakwater, with six people on board. Since the breakwater became operational in June 2011, Argyll Ferries operate from this docking facility. The &quot;Waverley&quot; struck the breakwater on 26 June 2009, with some 700 people on board. The pier was partially refurbished by Argyll and Bute Council during 2015. Now containing meeting rooms, it is purely a tourist attraction.

====Burgh Hall====
Dunoon Burgh Hall opened in 1874, the work of notable Glasgow architect Robert Alexander Bryden, who is buried in Dunoon Cemetery, a mile to the north. It is a Scottish baronial-style building that housed the municipal offices and had a hall accommodating 500 people. The Category B listed building re-opened in June 2017, and is a fully accessible venue for exhibitions, performances and gatherings. Alongside a gallery and theatre, the venue offers creative workshop space, a garden and a café.

====Other buildings====
On 20 August 2021, several Argyll Street buildings were destroyed in an arson attack.

===Landmarks and attractions===
Mary Campbell, also known as &quot;Highland Mary&quot; and &quot;Bonny Mary O&#x27; Argyll&quot;, was born at Auchamore Farm in Dunoon. She had a relationship with the bard Robert Burns. The &quot;Highland Mary&quot; statue was erected in 1896; it is prominently sited on Castle Hill, overlooking the breakwater in Dunoon. The statue is a scheduled monument (LB26437). 

The war memorial of Dunoon is located in the Castle Gardens, overlooking the pier.

The Queen&#x27;s Hall is the town&#x27;s major multi-function hall complex. It is situated opposite the head of the Victorian pier and built in 1958. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 11 August 1958. The building houses four function suites and a large main hall. The main hall has a stage with professional sound and lighting equipment, and attracted popular acts such as Pink Floyd, Blur, the Saw Doctors, David Gray, Morrissey, the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, Primal Scream and comedians Kevin Bridges, Bill Bailey and Roy Chubby Brown. In late 2015 the Queen&#x27;s Hall was closed to enable a major refurbishment. In December 2016, it was announced that the refurbishment would not commence until January 2017. The Queens Hall reopened in August 2018.

===Historical===
Modern Dunoon owes its existence to steam power; as late as 1822 there were only three or four slated houses, the rest of the residences being traditional Highland cottages. In the New Statistical Account, the MP James Ewing from Glasgow is named as beginning the expansion of the village when he built Castle House close to Dunoon Castle. The growth of the village increased from that time, paralleling the engineering-led growth of the steamers. Other infrastructural advances also helped like the construction of a jetty in 1835. From 1812 to the late 1960s, thousands of holiday-makers travelled &quot;doon the watter&quot; from Glasgow and industrial Lanarkshire to Dunoon and to numerous other town piers on the Firth of Clyde.

In 1868, the following summer excursions by water could be had from Dunoon (going and returning the same day):

The town&#x27;s sporting arena is Dunoon Stadium, which is located in the north of the town on Argyll Street. When it hosted football matches, it had the largest capacity of any amateur ground in Scotland. It later became the focal point of the Cowal Highland Gathering. Motorcycle dirt track racing (or speedway) was staged at the stadium on 18 June 1932 as part of the annual Dunoon and Cowal Agricultural Show. A demonstration event had been staged in May 1932.

The Dunoon Youth Football League (DYFL), founded in 1981, is a voluntary organisation that teaches football skills to all interested children with ages between 4 and 17.

Cowal Golf Club is situated on the hillside above Kirn. Founded in October 1891, initially as a nine-hole course designed by Willie Campbell from Bridge of Weir. It was formerly an eighteen-hole course, reconstructed by James Braid between 1924 and 1928. The current clubhouse was built in 1996. Due to financial issues, club assets were sold off in 2020. The golf club is still trading, although as a result of a land sale the course is now only a twelve-hole course. The club is now owned by &quot;Cowal Golf and Lodge Resort Ltd.

The two bowling clubs in Dunoon are Dunoon–Argyll Bowling Club, on Mary Street, and Bogleha&#x27; Bowling Club, on Argyll Street. They are two of the 21 members of Bowls Scotland&#x27;s District 26.

===Walks===
Trails (walks, running and mountain biking) thread through the hills surrounding Dunoon. Corlarach Hill has waymarked routes for walkers, mountain biking and horse riders. These trails are located next to the Bishop&#x27;s Glen.

Puck&#x27;s Glen is a popular short walk set in the hills close to Benmore Botanic Garden. (The arboretum at Benmore Botanic Garden, formerly a private garden for the Younger family, is now open to the public. It comprises and features some of the tallest trees in Britain, including the avenue of Giant Redwoods (Sequoia), some of which are over high. One of Dunoon&#x27;s listed buildings is the Grade 2 Victorian fernery, which was reopened in 2009 after an 18-month restoration.) Part of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the Garden is north of the town, just before Loch Eck. A tumbling burn, criss-crossed by bridges, is enclosed by rocky walls heavily hung with mosses and overshadowed by dense trees. The walk has clear, waymarked paths. The glen is named after Puck, from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

Morag&#x27;s Fairy Glen is a short gorge walk, with trails alongside the Berry Burn, located on the hill behind the West Bay area of Dunoon.

The Bishop&#x27;s Glen Reservoir trail follows the shore of the remaining one of three reservoirs in the glen, that used to supply fresh water to Dunoon. The reservoir is damming the Balgaidgh Burn (Balgie) and is now a freshwater fly fishing location. Access to the hills behind Dunoon, including Corlarach Hill, is available from the Bishop&#x27;s Glen Reservoir trail.

==Media==
Dunoon&#x27;s local weekly newspaper is the &quot;Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard&quot;, which was founded in 1871 in Sandbank by editor and proprietor William Inglis Sr. (The town once had three other newspapers, namely the &quot;Cowal Watchman&quot; (1876), &quot;Dunoon Herald and Cowal Advertiser&quot; and the &quot;Dunoon Telegraph&quot;.)

<text>Glenn Shafer (born November 21, 1946) is an American mathematician and statistician. He is the co-creator of Dempster–Shafer theory. He is a University Professor and Board of Governors Professor at Rutgers University.

==Early life and education==

Shafer grew up on a farm near Caney, Kansas. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from Princeton University, then entered the Peace Corps, serving in Afghanistan. He returned to Princeton, earning a PhD in mathematical statistics in 1973 under Geoffrey Watson.

==Career==

He taught at Princeton and the University of Kansas, joining the faculty of Rutgers Business School – Newark and New Brunswick in 1992. From 2011 to 2014 he served as dean of the school.

During the 1970s and 1980s he expanded a theory first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster to create Dempster–Shafer theory, also described as the theory of belief functions or evidence theory. It is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, allowing one to combine evidence from different sources and arrive at a degree of belief (represented by a mathematical object called &quot;belief function&quot;) that takes into account all the available evidence. The theory and its extensions have been of particular interest to the artificial intelligence community.

More recently he worked with Vladimir Vovk to develop a game-theoretic framework for probability. That work produced a 2001 book, &quot;Probability and Finance: It&#x27;s Only a Game!&quot; A joint research group between Rutgers and Royal Holloway, University of London has produced more than 50 working papers on the subject.

<text>In religion, a relic is an object or article of religious significance from the past. It usually consists of the physical remains or personal effects of a saint or other person preserved for the purpose of veneration as a tangible memorial. Relics are an important aspect of some forms of Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, shamanism, and many other religions. &quot;Relic&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;reliquiae&quot;, meaning &quot;remains&quot;, and a form of the Latin verb &quot;relinquere&quot;, to &quot;leave behind, or abandon&quot;. A reliquary is a shrine that houses one or more religious relics.

==In classical antiquity==
In ancient Greece, a city or sanctuary might claim to possess, without necessarily displaying, the remains of a venerated hero as a part of a hero cult. Other venerable objects associated with the hero were more likely to be on display in sanctuaries, such as spears, shields, or other weaponry; chariots, ships or figureheads; furniture such as chairs or tripods; and clothing. The sanctuary of the Leucippides at Sparta claimed to display the egg of Leda.

The bones were not regarded as holding a particular power derived from the hero, with some exceptions, such as the divine shoulder of Pelops held at Olympia. Miracles and healing were not regularly attributed to them; rather, their presence was meant to serve a tutelary function, as the tomb of Oedipus was said to protect Athens.

The bones of Orestes and Theseus were supposed to have been stolen or removed from their original resting place and reburied. On the advice of the Delphic Oracle, the Spartans searched for the bones of Orestes and brought them home, without which they had been told they could not expect victory in their war against the neighboring Tegeans. Plutarch says that the Athenians were likewise instructed by the oracle to locate and steal the relics of Theseus from the Dolopians.

The body of the legendary Eurystheus was also supposed to protect Athens from enemy attack, and in Thebes, that of the prophet Amphiaraus, whose cult was oracular and healing. Plutarch narrates transferrals similar to that of Theseus for the bodies of the historical Demetrius I of Macedon and Phocion the Good. The bones or ashes of Aesculapius at Epidaurus, and of Perdiccas I at Macedon, were treated with the deepest veneration.

As with the relics of Theseus, the bones are sometimes described in literary sources as gigantic, an indication of the hero&#x27;s &quot;larger than life&quot; status. On the basis of their reported size, it has been conjectured that such bones were those of prehistoric creatures, the startling discovery of which may have prompted the sanctifying of the site.

The head of the poet-prophet Orpheus was supposed to have been transported to Lesbos, where it was enshrined and visited as an oracle. The 2nd-century geographer Pausanias reported that the bones of Orpheus were kept in a stone vase displayed on a pillar near Dion, his place of death and a major religious center. These too were regarded as having oracular power, which might be accessed through dreaming in a ritual of incubation. The accidental exposure of the bones brought a disaster upon the town of Libretha, whence the people of Dion had transferred the relics to their own keeping.

According to the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, the bones of the Persian Zoroaster were venerated, but the tradition of Zoroastrianism and its scriptures offer no support of this.

==Christianity==
===History===
One of the earliest sources that purports to show the efficacy of relics is found in 2 Kings 13:20–21:
Also cited is the veneration of relics from the martyr and bishop Saint Polycarp of Smyrna recorded in the &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot;, written sometime from 150 to 160 AD. With regard to relics that are objects, an often cited passage is Acts 19:11–12, which says that Paul the Apostle&#x27;s handkerchiefs were imbued by God with healing power. In the gospel accounts of Jesus healing the bleeding woman and again in the Gospel of Mark 6:56, those who touched Jesus&#x27; garment were healed.

The practice of venerating relics seems to have been taken for granted by writers like Augustine, St. Ambrose, Gregory of Nyssa, St. Chrysostom, and St. Gregory Nazianzen. Dom Bernardo Cignitti, O.S.B., wrote, &quot;[T]he remains of certain dead are surrounded with special care and veneration. This is because the mortal remains of the deceased are associated in some manner with the holiness of their souls which await reunion with their bodies in the resurrection.&quot; Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) pointed out that it was natural that people should treasure what is associated with the dead, much like the personal effects of a relative. In an interview with Catholic News Service, Fr. Mario Conte, executive editor of the Messenger of St. Anthony magazine in Padua, Italy, said, &quot;Saints&#x27; relics help people overcome the abstract and make a connection with the holy ... Saints do not perform miracles. Only God performs miracles, but saints are intercessors.&quot;

In the early Church the disturbance of the remains of martyrs and other saints was not practiced. They were allowed to remain in their often unidentified resting places such as in cemeteries and the catacombs of Rome. These places were always outside the walls of the city, but martyriums began to be built over the site of the burial. Since it was considered beneficial to the soul to be buried close to the remains of saints, several large &quot;funerary halls&quot; were built over the sites of martyr&#x27;s graves, including Old Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. These were initially not regular churches, but &quot;covered cemeteries&quot; crammed with graves, wherein was celebrated funerary and memorial services. It may have been thought that when the souls of the martyrs went to heaven on resurrection day they would be accompanied by those interred nearby, who would thus gain favour with God.

Some early Christians attributed healing powers to the dust from graves of saints, including Gregory of Tours. The cult of Martin of Tours was very popular in Merovingian Gaul, and centered at a great church built just outside the walls of Tours. When Saint Martin died on November 8, 397, at a village halfway between Tours and Poitiers, the inhabitants of these cities were ready to fight for his body, which the people of Tours managed to secure by stealth. Tours became the chief point of Christian pilgrimage in Gaul, a place for the healing of the sick. 

Gregory of Tours travelled to the shrine when he had contracted a serious illness. Later, as bishop of Tours, Gregory wrote extensively about miracles attributed to the intercession of St Martin. Nestorian Christianity utilized the &quot;hanānā&quot;–a mixture made with the dust of Thomas the Apostle&#x27;s tomb–for healing. Within the Assyrian Church of the East, it is consumed by a couple getting married in the Mystery of Crowning.

The Second Council of Nicaea in 787 drew on the teaching of St. John Damascene that homage or respect is not really paid to an inanimate object, but to the holy person, the veneration of a holy person is itself honour paid to God. The Council decreed that every altar should contain a relic, making it clear that this was already the norm, as it remains to the present day in Catholic and Orthodox churches. The veneration of the relics of the saints reflects a belief that the saints in heaven intercede for those on earth. A number of cures and miracles have been attributed to relics, not because of their own power, but because of the holiness of the saint they represent.

Many tales of miracles and other marvels were attributed to relics beginning in the early centuries of the church. These became popular during the Middle Ages. They were collected in books of hagiography such as the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; or the works of Caesarius of Heisterbach. These miracle tales made relics much sought-after during the period. By the Late Middle Ages, the collecting of, and dealing in, relics had reached enormous proportions, and had spread from the church to royalty, and then to the nobility and merchant classes.

The Council of Trent of 1563 enjoined bishops to instruct their flocks that &quot;the holy bodies of holy martyrs ... are to be venerated by the faithful, for through these [bodies] many benefits are bestowed by God on men&quot;. The Council further insisted that &quot;in the invocation of saints, the veneration of relics and the sacred use of images, every superstition shall be removed and all filthy lucre abolished.&quot; There are also many relics associated with Jesus.

In his introduction to Gregory&#x27;s &quot;History of the Franks&quot;, Ernest Brehaut analyzed the Romano-Christian concepts that gave relics such a powerful draw. He distinguished Gregory&#x27;s constant usage of &quot;sanctus&quot; and &quot;virtus&quot;, the first with its familiar meaning of &quot;sacred&quot; or &quot;holy&quot;, and the second as &quot;the mystic potency emanating from the person or thing that is sacred... In a practical way the second word &quot;[virtus]&quot; ... describes the uncanny, mysterious power emanating from the supernatural and affecting the natural... These points of contact and yielding are the miracles we continually hear of.&quot;

===Relics and pilgrimage===
Rome became a major destination for Christian pilgrims as it was easier to access for European pilgrims than the Holy Land. Constantine the Great erected great basilicas over the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. A distinction of these sites was the presence of holy relics. Over the course of the Middle Ages, other religious structures acquired relics and became destinations for pilgrimage. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, substantial numbers of pilgrims flocked to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, in which the supposed relics of the apostle James, son of Zebedee, discovered 830, are housed. Santiago de Compostela remains a significant pilgrimage site, with around 200,000 pilgrims, both secular and Christian, completing the numerous pilgrimage routes to the cathedral in 2012 alone.

By venerating relics through visitation, gifts, and providing services, medieval Christians believed that they would acquire the protection and intercession of the sanctified dead. Relics of local saints drew visitors to sites like Saint Frideswide&#x27;s in Oxford, and San Nicola Peregrino in Trani. Instead of having to travel to be near to a venerated saint, relics of the saint could be venerated locally. 

Believers would make pilgrimages to places believed to have been sanctified by the physical presence of Christ or prominent saints, such as the site of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

====Economic effect====
As holy relics attracted pilgrims and these religious tourists needed to be housed, fed, and provided with souvenirs, relics became a source of income not only for the destinations that held them, but for the abbeys, churches, and towns en route. Relics were prized as they were portable. They could be possessed, inventoried, bequeathed, stolen, counterfeited, and smuggled. They could add value to an established site or confer significance on a new location. Offerings made at a site of pilgrimage were an important source of revenue for the community who received them on behalf of the saint. 

According to Patrick Geary, &quot;[t]o the communities fortunate enough to have a saint&#x27;s remains in its church, the benefits in terms of revenue and status were enormous, and competition to acquire relics and to promote the local saint&#x27;s virtues over those of neighboring communities was keen.&quot; Local clergy promoted their own patron saints in an effort to secure their own market share. On occasion guards had to watch over mortally ill holy men and women to prevent the unauthorized dismemberment of their corpses as soon as they died. Geary also suggests that the danger of someone murdering an aging holy man in order to acquire his relics was a legitimate concern.

Relics were used to cure the sick, to seek intercession for relief from famine or plague, to take solemn oaths, and to pressure warring factions to make peace in the presence of the sacred. Courts held relics since Merovingian times. St Angilbert acquired for Charlemagne one of the most impressive collections in Christendom. An active market developed and relics entered into commerce along the same trade routes followed by other portable commodities. Matthew Brown likens a ninth-century Italian deacon named Deusdona, with access to the Roman catacombs, as crossing the Alps to visit monastic fairs of northern Europe much like a contemporary art dealer.

Canterbury was a popular destination for English pilgrims, who traveled to witness the miracle-working relics of St Thomas Becket, the sainted Archbishop of Canterbury who was assassinated by knights of King Henry II in 1170. After Becket&#x27;s death, his successor and the Canterbury chapter quickly used his relics to promote the cult of the as-yet-uncanonized martyr. The motivations included the assertion of the Church&#x27;s independence against rulers, a desire to have an English (indeed Norman English) saint of European reputation, and the desire to promote Canterbury as a destination for pilgrimage. In the first years after Becket&#x27;s death, donations at the shrine accounted for twenty-eight percent of the cathedral&#x27;s total revenues.

===Counterfeits===
In the absence of real ways of assessing authenticity, relic-collectors became prey to the unscrupulous, and some extremely high prices were paid. Forgeries proliferated from the very beginning. Augustine already denounced impostors who wandered around disguised as monks, making a profit from the sale of spurious relics. In his &quot;Admonitio Generalis&quot; of 789, Charlemagne ordered that &quot;the false names of martyrs and the uncertain memorials of saints should not be venerated.&quot; The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) of the Catholic Church condemned abuses such as counterfeit relics and exaggerated claims.

Pieces of the True Cross were one of the most highly sought-after of such relics; many churches claimed to possess a piece of it, so many that John Calvin famously remarked that there were enough pieces of the True Cross to build a ship from. By the middle of the 16th century, the number of relics in Christian churches became enormous, and there was practically no possibility to distinguish the authentic from the falsification, since both of them had been in the temples for centuries and were objects for worship. In 1543, John Calvin wrote about fake relics in his &quot;Treatise on Relics&quot;, in which he described the state of affairs with relics in Catholic churches. Calvin says that the saints have two or three or more bodies with arms and legs, and even a few extra limbs and heads.

Due to the existence of counterfeit relics, the Church began to regulate the use of relics. Canon Law required the authentication of relics if they were to be publicly venerated. They had to be sealed in a reliquary and accompanied by a certificate of authentication, signed and sealed by someone in the Congregation for Saints, or by the local Bishop where the saint lived. Without such authentication, relics are not to be used for public veneration. The Congregation for Saints, as part of the Roman Curia, holds the authority to verify relics in which documentation is lost or missing. The documents and reliquaries of authenticated relics are usually affixed with a wax seal.

===Classifications and prohibitions in the Catholic Church===


In Catholic theology, sacred relics must not be worshipped, because only God is worshipped and adored. Instead, the veneration given to them was &quot;dulia&quot;. Saint Jerome declared, &quot;We do not worship, we do not adore, for fear that we should bow down to the creature rather than to the Creator, but we venerate the relics of the martyrs in order the better to adore Him whose martyrs they are.&quot;

Until 2017, the Catholic Church divided relics into three classes:
* First-class relics: items directly associated with the events of Christ&#x27;s life (manger, cross, etc.) or the physical remains of a saint (a bone, a hair, skull, a limb, etc.). Traditionally, a martyr&#x27;s relics are often more prized than the relics of other saints. Parts of the saint that were significant to that saint&#x27;s life are more prized relics. For instance, King St. Stephen of Hungary&#x27;s right forearm is especially important because of his status as a ruler. A famous theologian&#x27;s head may be his most important relic; the head of St. Thomas Aquinas was removed by the monks at the Cistercian abbey at Fossanova where he died. If a saint travelled often, then the bones of his feet may be prized. Catholic teaching prohibits relics to be divided up into small, unrecognizable parts if they are to be used in liturgy (i.e., as in an altar; see the rubrics listed in Rite of Dedication of a Church and an Altar).
* Second-class relics: items that the saint owned or frequently used, for example, a crucifix, rosary, book, etc. Again, an item more important in the saint&#x27;s life is thus a more important relic. Sometimes a second-class relic is a part of an item that the saint wore (a shirt, a glove, etc.) and is known as &quot;ex indumentis&quot; (&quot;from the clothing&quot;).
* Third-class relics: any object that has been in contact with a first- or second-class relic. Most third-class relics are small pieces of cloth, though in the first millennium oil was popular; the Monza ampullae contained oil collected from lamps burning before the major sites of Christ&#x27;s life, and some reliquaries had holes for oil to be poured in and out again. Many people call the cloth touched to the bones of saints &quot;ex brandea&quot;. But &quot;ex brandea&quot; strictly refers to pieces of clothing that were touched to the body or tombs of the apostles. It is a term that is used only for such; it is not a synonym for a third-class relic.
In 2017, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints abolished the relics of the third degree, introducing a two-stage scale of classification of relics: significant (insigni) and non-significant (non insigni) relics. The first are the bodies or their significant parts, as well as the entire contents of the urn with the ashes preserved after cremation. The second includes small fragments of the bodies, as well as objects used by saints and blesseds.

The sale or disposal by other means of &quot;sacred relics&quot; (meaning first and second class) without the permission of the Apostolic See is now strictly forbidden by canon 1190 of the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;. However, the Catholic Church permitted the sale of third-class relics. Relics may not be placed upon the altar for public veneration, as that is reserved for the display of the Blessed Sacrament (host or prosphora and Eucharistic wine after consecration in the sacrament of the Eucharist).


===Eastern Orthodoxy===

The importance of relics in the Byzantine world can be seen from the veneration given to the pieces of the True Cross. Many great works of Byzantine enamel are &quot;staurothekes&quot;, or relics containing fragments of the True Cross. Other significant relics included the girdle worn by the Virgin, and pieces of the body or clothing of saints. Such relics (called contact relics, or secondary relics) were, however, scarce and did not provide most believers with ready access to proximity to the holy. The growth in the production and popularity of reproducible contact relics in the fifth and sixth centuries testifies to the need felt for more widespread access to the divine.

These contact relics usually involved the placing of readily available objects, such as pieces of cloth, clay tablets, or water then bottled for believers, in contact with a relic. Alternatively, such objects could be dipped into water which had been in contact with the relic (such as the bone of a saint). These relics, a firmly embedded part of veneration by this period, increased the availability of access to the divine but were not infinitely reproducible (an original relic was required), and still usually required believers to undertake pilgrimage or have contact with somebody who had.

The earliest recorded removal, or translation of saintly remains was that of Saint Babylas at Antioch in 354, but, partly perhaps because Constantinople lacked the many saintly graves of Rome, they soon became common in the Eastern Empire, though still prohibited in the West. The Eastern capital was therefore able to acquire the remains of Saints Timothy, Andrew and Luke, and the division of bodies also began, the 5th century theologian Theodoretus declaring that &quot;Grace remains entire with every part.&quot; In the West, a decree of Theodosius only allowed the moving of a whole sarcophagus with its contents, but the upheavals of the barbarian invasions relaxed the rules, as remains needed to be relocated to safer places.

The veneration of relics continues to be of importance in the Eastern Orthodox Church. As a natural outgrowth of the concept in Orthodox theology of theosis, the physical bodies of the saints are considered to be transformed by divine grace—indeed, all Orthodox Christians are considered to be sanctified by living the mystical life of the Church, and especially by receiving the Sacred Mysteries (Sacraments). In the Orthodox service books, the remains of the departed faithful are referred to as &quot;relics&quot;, and are treated with honour and respect. For this reason, the bodies of Orthodox Christians are traditionally not embalmed.

The veneration of the relics of the saints is of great importance in Orthodoxy, and very often churches will display the relics of saints prominently. In a number of monasteries, particularly those on the semi-autonomous Mount Athos in Greece, all of the relics the monastery possesses are displayed and venerated each evening at Compline. As with the veneration of icons, the veneration (Greek; δουλια, &quot;dulia&quot;) of relics in the Orthodox Church is clearly distinguished from adoration (λατρεια, &quot;latria&quot;); i.e., that worship which is due to God alone. Thus Orthodox teaching warns the faithful against idolatry and at the same time remains true to scriptural teaching (vis. 2 Kings 13:20–21) as understood by Orthodox Sacred Tradition.

The examination of the relics is an important step in the glorification (canonization) of new saints. Sometimes, one of the signs of sanctification is the condition of the relics of the saint. Some saints will be incorrupt, meaning that their remains do not decay under conditions when they normally would (natural mummification is not the same as incorruption). Sometimes even when the flesh does decay the bones themselves will manifest signs of sanctity. They may be honey-coloured or give off a sweet aroma. Some relics will exude myrrh. The absence of such manifestations is not necessarily a sign that the person is not a Saint.

Relics play a major role in the consecration of a church. The consecrating bishop will place the relics on a diskos (paten) in a church near the church that is to be consecrated, they will then be taken in a cross procession to the new church, carried three times around the new structure and then placed in the Holy Table (altar) as part of the consecration service.

The relics of saints (traditionally, always those of a martyr) are also sewn into the antimension which is given to a priest by his bishop as a means of bestowing faculties upon him (i.e., granting him permission to celebrate the Sacred Mysteries). The antimens is kept on the Holy Table (altar), and it is forbidden to celebrate the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist) without it. Occasionally, in cases of fixed altars, the relics are built in the altar table itself and sealed with a special mixture called wax-mastic.

The necessity of provide relics for antimensions in new churches often necessitates continuous division of relics. An account of this process can be found in a treatise of the pre-revolutionary Russian church historian . According to Romansky, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church operated a special office, located in the Church of Philip the Apostle in the Moscow Kremlin, where bones of numerous saints, authenticated by the church&#x27;s hierarchs, were stored, and pieces of them were prayerfully separated with hammer and chisel to be sent to the dioceses that needed to place them into new antimensions.

===In art===
Many churches were built along pilgrimage routes. A number in Europe were either founded or rebuilt specifically to enshrine relics, (such as San Marco in Venice) and to welcome and awe the large crowds of pilgrims who came to seek their help. Romanesque buildings developed passageways behind the altar to allow for the creation of several smaller chapels designed to house relics. From the exterior, this collection of small rooms is seen as a cluster of delicate, curved roofs at one end of the church, a distinctive feature of many Romanesque churches. Gothic churches featured lofty, recessed porches which provided space for statuary and the display of relics.

Historian and philosopher of art Hans Belting observed that in medieval painting, images explained the relic and served as a testament to its authenticity. In &quot;Likeness and Presence&quot;, Belting argued that the cult of relics helped to stimulate the rise of painting in medieval Europe.

====Reliquaries====
Reliquaries are containers used to protect and display relics. While frequently taking the form of caskets, they have many other forms, including simulations of the relic encased within (e.g., a gilded depiction of an arm for a relic consisting of arm bones). Since the relics themselves were considered valuable, they were enshrined in containers crafted of or covered with gold, silver, gems, and enamel. 

Ivory was widely used in the Middle Ages for reliquaries, its pure white color an indication of the holy status of its contents. These objects constituted a major form of artistic production across Europe and Byzantium throughout the Middle Ages.

===List of claimed relics===


* Relics of the True Cross of Jesus are claimed by many churches around the world. The same applies to Holy Nails, Holy Sponges, Holy Lances, Holy Thorns and other Instruments of the Passion. Famous examples are the Holy Nail in the Iron Crown of Lombardy in Monza Cathedral, the Holy Lance that was part of the Crown Jewels of the Holy Roman Empire in the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, and the Holy Thorn Reliquary in the British Museum in London.
* The Seamless robe of Jesus is kept in a purpose-built chapel in Trier Cathedral.
* The Sandals of Jesus Christ were donated to Prüm Abbey, Germany, by popes Zachary and Stephen II in the 8th century.
* The Marienschrein in Aachen Cathedral contains four important relics: the nappy and loin cloth of Jesus, the dress of Mary and the decapitation cloth of John the Baptist. The Karlsschrein in the same church contains the remains of Charlemagne, who was locally venerated as a saint.
* The Girdle of Mary is kept in the Basilica of Our Lady in Maastricht, Netherlands.
* The Shrine of the Three Kings in Cologne Cathedral contains the remnants of the biblical Magi.
* St Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican contains Saint Peter&#x27;s relics.
* St Paul&#x27;s relics are allegedly contained in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Wall, in Rome.
*St James&#x27; relics are reputedly held at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, Spain.
*St Luke the Evangelist&#x27;s body is held at the Abbey of Santa Giustina in Padua, Italy; his head, in the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague; and a rib, at his tomb in Thebes, Greece.
* St Mark the Evangelist&#x27;s relics are held at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice.
* St Matthew the Evangelist&#x27;s relics are purported to be in the Cathedral of Salerno, Italy.
* St John the Evangelist&#x27;s tomb is purported to be in the Basilica of St. John at Ephesus in Turkey. The opening of his tomb during Constantine the Great&#x27;s reign yielded no bones, giving rise to the belief that his body was assumed into heaven.
*John the Baptist&#x27;s skull, or parts of it, are venerated at the Amiens Cathedral in France, at the Church of San Silvestre in Capite in Rome and at the Munich Residenz Palace. His other relics were discovered in a Bulgarian monastery in 2010.
*St Andrew&#x27;s relics are contained in the Basilica of St Andrew in Patras, Greece.
* Reliquary arms of Saint Thomas the Apostle can be found in churches around the globe. Most contain only a fragment of the arm that allegedly touched Christ&#x27;s side wound after the Resurrection.

== Hinduism ==
In Hinduism, relics are less common than in other religions since the physical remains of most saints are cremated. The veneration of corporal relics may have originated with the &quot;śramaṇa&quot; movement or the appearance of Buddhism, and burial practices became more common after the Muslim invasions. One prominent example is the preserved body of Swami Ramanuja in a separate shrine inside Srirangam Temple.

==Islam==

The veneration of the relics of saints became an incredibly important part of devotional piety in both Sunni and Shia Islam throughout the classical and medieval periods, with &quot;the ubiquity of relics and ritual practices associated with them&quot; becoming a mainstay of &quot;the devotional life of the Muslims ... [all over the world but particularly in] the Near East and North Africa.&quot; With the latter-day influence of the reformist movements of Salafism and Wahhabism, there is, according to some scholars, an erroneous perception which persists both among some modern Muslims and Western observers opining that &quot;the Islamic experience[&#x27;s relationship with relic-veneration] is marginal, because of the perceived absence of relics
in Islam.&quot; It is, however, evident that &quot;the historical reality of relics in Islam&quot; was very different, and that the classical Islamic thinkers posed various reasons for why the veneration of the relics of prophets and saints was permissible.

===Relics of the prophets===

====In Istanbul====

While various relics are preserved by different Muslim communities, the most important are those known as The Sacred Trusts, more than 600 pieces treasured in the Privy Chamber of the Topkapı Palace Museum in Istanbul.

Muslims believe that these treasures include:
* Hair from Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s beard and footprint
* Sword of Ali
* Sword of David
* Turban of Joseph
* Staff of Moses
* Pot of Abraham
* Forearm and hand of Yahya

Most of the trusts can be seen in the museum, but the most important of them can only be seen during the month of Ramadan. The Qur&#x27;an has been recited next to these relics uninterruptedly since they were brought to the Topkapı Palace, but Muslims do not worship these relics.

====Sacred Cloak of the Prophet====

A cloak () believed to have belonged to the prophet Mohammed is kept in the central mosque in Kandahar, Afghanistan. According to local history, it was given to Ahmad Shah by Mured Beg, the Emir of Bokhara. The Sacred Cloak is kept locked away, taken out only at times of great crisis. In 1996 Mullah Omar, leader of the Afghan Taliban, took it out, displayed it to a crowd of (religious scholars) and was declared (&quot;Commander of the Faithful&quot;). Prior to this, the last time it had been removed had been when the city was struck by a cholera epidemic in the 1930s.

==Cultural relics==
&quot;Relic&quot; is also the term for something that has survived the passage of time, especially an object or custom whose original culture has disappeared, but also an object cherished for historical or memorial value (such as a keepsake or heirloom).

&quot;Cultural relic&quot; is a common translation for (), a common Chinese word that usually means &quot;antique&quot; but can be extended to anything, including object and monument, that is of historical and cultural value. However, this has some issues since the term has little resemblance to the English usage of &quot;relic&quot;. In most cases, &quot;artifact&quot;, &quot;archaeological site&quot;, &quot;monument&quot;, or just plain &quot;archaeology&quot; would be a better translation.

<text>The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory (DST), is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. First introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in the context of statistical inference, the theory was later developed by Glenn Shafer into a general framework for modeling epistemic uncertainty—a mathematical theory of evidence. The theory allows one to combine evidence from different sources and arrive at a degree of belief (represented by a mathematical object called &quot;belief function&quot;) that takes into account all the available evidence.

In a narrow sense, the term Dempster–Shafer theory refers to the original conception of the theory by Dempster and Shafer. However, it is more common to use the term in the wider sense of the same general approach, as adapted to specific kinds of situations. In particular, many authors have proposed different rules for combining evidence, often with a view to handling conflicts in evidence better. The early contributions have also been the starting points of many important developments, including the transferable belief model and the theory of hints.

==Overview==
Dempster–Shafer theory is a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability. Belief functions base degrees of belief (or confidence, or trust) for one question on the subjective probabilities for a related question. The degrees of belief themselves may or may not have the mathematical properties of probabilities; how much they differ depends on how closely the two questions are related. Put another way, it is a way of representing epistemic plausibilities, but it can yield answers that contradict those arrived at using probability theory.

Often used as a method of sensor fusion, Dempster–Shafer theory is based on two ideas: obtaining degrees of belief for one question from subjective probabilities for a related question, and Dempster&#x27;s rule for combining such degrees of belief when they are based on independent items of evidence. In essence, the degree of belief in a proposition depends primarily upon the number of answers (to the related questions) containing the proposition, and the subjective probability of each answer. Also contributing are the rules of combination that reflect general assumptions about the data.

In this formalism a degree of belief (also referred to as a mass) is represented as a belief function rather than a Bayesian probability distribution. Probability values are assigned to &quot;sets&quot; of possibilities rather than single events: their appeal rests on the fact they naturally encode evidence in favor of propositions.

Dempster–Shafer theory assigns its masses to all of the subsets of the set of states of a system—in set-theoretic terms, the power set of the states. For instance, assume a situation where there are two possible states of a system. For this system, any belief function assigns mass to the first state, the second, to both, and to neither.

===Belief and plausibility===
Shafer&#x27;s formalism starts from a set of &quot;possibilities&quot; under consideration, for instance numerical values of a variable, or pairs of linguistic variables like &quot;date and place of origin of a relic&quot; (asking whether it is antique or a recent fake). A hypothesis is represented by a subset of this &quot;frame of discernment&quot;, like &quot;(Ming dynasty, China)&quot;, or &quot;(19th century, Germany)&quot;.

Shafer&#x27;s framework allows for belief about such propositions to be represented as intervals, bounded by two values, &quot;belief&quot; (or &quot;support&quot;) and &quot;plausibility&quot;:

:&quot;belief&quot; ≤ &quot;plausibility&quot;.

In a first step, subjective probabilities (&quot;masses&quot;) are assigned to all subsets of the frame; usually, only a restricted number of sets will have non-zero mass (&quot;focal elements&quot;). &quot;Belief&quot; in a hypothesis is constituted by the sum of the masses of all subsets of the hypothesis-set. It is the amount of belief that directly supports either the given hypothesis or a more specific one, thus forming a lower bound on its probability. Belief (usually denoted &quot;Bel&quot;) measures the strength of the evidence in favor of a proposition &quot;p&quot;. It ranges from 0 (indicating no evidence) to 1 (denoting certainty). &quot;Plausibility&quot; is 1 minus the sum of the masses of all sets whose intersection with the hypothesis is empty. Or, it can be obtained as the sum of the masses of all sets whose intersection with the hypothesis is not empty. It is an upper bound on the possibility that the hypothesis could be true, because there is only so much evidence that contradicts that hypothesis. Plausibility (denoted by Pl) is thus related to Bel by Pl(&quot;p&quot;) = 1 − Bel(~&quot;p&quot;). It also ranges from 0 to 1 and measures the extent to which evidence in favor of ~&quot;p&quot; leaves room for belief in &quot;p&quot;.

For example, suppose we have a belief of 0.5 for a proposition, say &quot;the cat in the box is dead.&quot; This means that we have evidence that allows us to state strongly that the proposition is true with a confidence of 0.5. However, the evidence contrary to that hypothesis (i.e. &quot;the cat is alive&quot;) only has a confidence of 0.2. The remaining mass of 0.3 (the gap between the 0.5 supporting evidence on the one hand, and the 0.2 contrary evidence on the other) is &quot;indeterminate,&quot; meaning that the cat could either be dead or alive. This interval represents the level of uncertainty based on the evidence in the system.

The &quot;neither&quot; hypothesis is set to zero by definition (it corresponds to &quot;no solution&quot;). The orthogonal hypotheses &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Dead&quot; have probabilities of 0.2 and 0.5, respectively. This could correspond to &quot;Live/Dead Cat Detector&quot; signals, which have respective reliabilities of 0.2 and 0.5. Finally, the all-encompassing &quot;Either&quot; hypothesis (which simply acknowledges there is a cat in the box) picks up the slack so that the sum of the masses is 1. The belief for the &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Dead&quot; hypotheses matches their corresponding masses because they have no subsets; belief for &quot;Either&quot; consists of the sum of all three masses (Either, Alive, and Dead) because &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Dead&quot; are each subsets of &quot;Either&quot;. The &quot;Alive&quot; plausibility is 1 − &quot;m&quot; (Dead): 0.5 and the &quot;Dead&quot; plausibility is 1 − &quot;m&quot; (Alive): 0.8. In other way, the &quot;Alive&quot; plausibility is &quot;m&quot;(Alive) + &quot;m&quot;(Either) and the &quot;Dead&quot; plausibility is &quot;m&quot;(Dead) + &quot;m&quot;(Either). Finally, the &quot;Either&quot; plausibility sums &quot;m&quot;(Alive) + &quot;m&quot;(Dead) + &quot;m&quot;(Either). The universal hypothesis (&quot;Either&quot;) will always have 100% belief and plausibility—it acts as a checksum of sorts.

Here is a somewhat more elaborate example where the behavior of belief and plausibility begins to emerge. We&#x27;re looking through a variety of detector systems at a single faraway signal light, which can only be coloured in one of three colours (red, yellow, or green):

Events of this kind would not be modeled as distinct entities in probability space as they are here in mass assignment space. Rather the event &quot;Red or Yellow&quot; would be considered as the union of the events &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot;, and (see probability axioms) &quot;P&quot;(Red or Yellow) ≥ &quot;P&quot;(Yellow), and &quot;P&quot;(Any) = 1, where &quot;Any&quot; refers to &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;Yellow&quot; or &quot;Green&quot;. In DST the mass assigned to &quot;Any&quot; refers to the proportion of evidence that can not be assigned to any of the other states, which here means evidence that says there is a light but does not say anything about what color it is. In this example, the proportion of evidence that shows the light is either &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;Green&quot; is given a mass of 0.05. Such evidence might, for example, be obtained from a R/G color blind person. DST lets us extract the value of this sensor&#x27;s evidence. Also, in DST the empty set is considered to have zero mass, meaning here that the signal light system exists and we are examining its possible states, not speculating as to whether it exists at all.

===Combining beliefs===
Beliefs from different sources can be combined with various fusion operators to model specific situations of belief fusion, e.g. with Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination, which combines belief constraints that are dictated by independent belief sources, such as in the case of combining hints or combining preferences. Note that the probability masses from propositions that contradict each other can be used to obtain a measure of conflict between the independent belief sources. Other situations can be modeled with different fusion operators, such as cumulative fusion of beliefs from independent sources, which can be modeled with the cumulative fusion operator.

Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination is sometimes interpreted as an approximate generalisation of Bayes&#x27; rule. In this interpretation the priors and conditionals need not be specified, unlike traditional Bayesian methods, which often use a symmetry (minimax error) argument to assign prior probabilities to random variables (&quot;e.g.&quot; assigning 0.5 to binary values for which no information is available about which is more likely). However, any information contained in the missing priors and conditionals is not used in Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination unless it can be obtained indirectly—and arguably is then available for calculation using Bayes equations.

Dempster–Shafer theory allows one to specify a degree of ignorance in this situation instead of being forced to supply prior probabilities that add to unity. This sort of situation, and whether there is a real distinction between &quot;risk&quot; and &quot;ignorance&quot;, has been extensively discussed by statisticians and economists. See, for example, the contrasting views of Daniel Ellsberg, Howard Raiffa, Kenneth Arrow and Frank Knight.

==Formal definition==
Let &quot;X&quot; be the &quot;universe&quot;: the set representing all possible states of a system under consideration. The power set

:formula_1

is the set of all subsets of &quot;X&quot;, including the empty set formula_2. For example, if:

:formula_3

then

:formula_4

The elements of the power set can be taken to represent propositions concerning the actual state of the system, by containing all and only the states in which the proposition is true.

The theory of evidence assigns a belief mass to each element of the power set. Formally, a function

:formula_5

is called a &quot;basic belief assignment&quot; (BBA), when it has two properties. First, the mass of the empty set is zero:

:formula_6

Second, the masses of all the members of the power set add up to a total of 1:

:formula_7

The mass &quot;m&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) of &quot;A&quot;, a given member of the power set, expresses the proportion of all relevant and available evidence that supports the claim that the actual state belongs to &quot;A&quot; but to no particular subset of &quot;A&quot;. The value of &quot;m&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) pertains &quot;only&quot; to the set &quot;A&quot; and makes no additional claims about any subsets of &quot;A&quot;, each of which have, by definition, their own mass.

From the mass assignments, the upper and lower bounds of a probability interval can be defined. This interval contains the precise probability of a set of interest (in the classical sense), and is bounded by two non-additive continuous measures called belief (or support) and plausibility:

:formula_8

The belief bel(&quot;A&quot;) for a set &quot;A&quot; is defined as the sum of all the masses of subsets of the set of interest:

:formula_9

The plausibility pl(&quot;A&quot;) is the sum of all the masses of the sets &quot;B&quot; that intersect the set of interest &quot;A&quot;:

:formula_10

The two measures are related to each other as follows:

:formula_11

And conversely, for finite &quot;A&quot;, given the belief measure bel(&quot;B&quot;) for all subsets &quot;B&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, we can find the masses &quot;m&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) with the following inverse function:

:formula_12

where |&quot;A&quot; − &quot;B&quot;| is the difference of the cardinalities of the two sets.

It follows from the last two equations that, for a finite set &quot;X&quot;, one needs to know only one of the three (mass, belief, or plausibility) to deduce the other two; though one may need to know the values for many sets in order to calculate one of the other values for a particular set. In the case of an infinite &quot;X&quot;, there can be well-defined belief and plausibility functions but no well-defined mass function.

==Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination==
The problem we now face is how to combine two independent sets of probability mass assignments in specific situations. In case different sources express their beliefs over the frame in terms of belief constraints such as in the case of giving hints or in the case of expressing preferences, then Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination is the appropriate fusion operator. This rule derives common shared belief between multiple sources and ignores &quot;all&quot; the conflicting (non-shared) belief through a normalization factor. Use of that rule in other situations than that of combining belief constraints has come under serious criticism, such as in case of fusing separate belief estimates from multiple sources that are to be integrated in a cumulative manner, and not as constraints. Cumulative fusion means that all probability masses from the different sources are reflected in the derived belief, so no probability mass is ignored.

Specifically, the combination (called the joint mass) is calculated from the two sets of masses &quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot;2 in the following manner:

:formula_13

:formula_14

where

:formula_15

&quot;K&quot; is a measure of the amount of conflict between the two mass sets.

===Effects of conflict===
The normalization factor above, 1 − &quot;K&quot;, has the effect of completely ignoring conflict and attributing &quot;any&quot; mass associated with conflict to the empty set. This combination rule for evidence can therefore produce counterintuitive results, as we show next.

====Example producing correct results in case of high conflict====
The following example shows how Dempster&#x27;s rule produces intuitive results when applied in a preference fusion situation, even when there is high conflict.

:Suppose that two friends, Alice and Bob, want to see a film at the cinema one evening, and that there are only three films showing: X, Y and Z. Alice expresses her preference for film X with probability 0.99, and her preference for film Y with a probability of only 0.01. Bob expresses his preference for film Z with probability 0.99, and his preference for film Y with a probability of only 0.01. When combining the preferences with Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination it turns out that their combined preference results in probability 1.0 for film Y, because it is the only film that they both agree to see.

:Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination produces intuitive results even in case of totally conflicting beliefs when interpreted in this way. Assume that Alice prefers film X with probability 1.0, and that Bob prefers film Z with probability 1.0. When trying to combine their preferences with Dempster&#x27;s rule it turns out that it is undefined in this case, which means that there is no solution. This would mean that they can not agree on seeing any film together, so they do not go to the cinema together that evening. However, the semantics of interpreting preference as a probability is vague: if it is referring to the probability of seeing film X tonight, then we face the fallacy of the excluded middle: the event that actually occurs, seeing none of the films tonight, has a probability mass of 0.

====Example producing counter-intuitive results in case of high conflict====
An example with exactly the same numerical values was introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in 1979,
to point out counter-intuitive results generated by Dempster&#x27;s rule when there is a high degree of conflict. The example goes as follows:

:Suppose that one has two equi-reliable doctors and one doctor believes a patient has either a brain tumor, with a probability (i.e. a basic belief assignment—bba&#x27;s, or mass of belief) of 0.99; or meningitis, with a probability of only 0.01. A second doctor believes the patient has a concussion, with a probability of 0.99, and believes the patient suffers from meningitis, with a probability of only 0.01. Applying Dempster&#x27;s rule to combine these two sets of masses of belief, one gets finally &quot;m&quot;(meningitis)=1 (the meningitis is diagnosed with 100 percent of confidence).

Such result goes against common sense since both doctors agree that there is a little chance that the patient has a meningitis. This example has been the starting point of many research works for trying to find a solid justification for Dempster&#x27;s rule and for foundations of Dempster–Shafer theory or to show the inconsistencies of this theory.

====Example producing counter-intuitive results in case of low conflict====
The following example shows where Dempster&#x27;s rule produces a counter-intuitive result, even when there is low conflict.

:Suppose that one doctor believes a patient has either a brain tumor, with a probability of 0.99, or meningitis, with a probability of only 0.01. A second doctor also believes the patient has a brain tumor, with a probability of 0.99, and believes the patient suffers from concussion, with a probability of only 0.01. If we calculate m (brain tumor) with Dempster&#x27;s rule, we obtain

::formula_16

This result implies &quot;complete support&quot; for the diagnosis of a brain tumor, which both doctors believed &quot;very likely&quot;. The agreement arises from the low degree of conflict between the two sets of evidence comprised by the two doctors&#x27; opinions.

In either case, it would be reasonable to expect that:

:formula_17

since the existence of non-zero belief probabilities for other diagnoses implies &quot;less than complete support&quot; for the brain tumour diagnosis.

== Dempster–Shafer as a generalisation of Bayesian theory ==
As in Dempster–Shafer theory, a Bayesian belief function formula_18 has the properties formula_19 and formula_20. The third condition, however, is subsumed by, but relaxed in DS theory:
:formula_21

Either of the following conditions implies the Bayesian special case of the DS theory:
* formula_22
* For finite &quot;X&quot;, all focal elements of the belief function are singletons.

As an example of how the two approaches differ, a Bayesian could model the color of a car as a probability distribution over (red, green, blue), assigning one number to each color. Dempster–Shafer would assign numbers to each of (red, green, blue, (red or green), (red or blue), (green or blue), (red or green or blue)). These numbers do not have to be coherent; for example, Bel(red)+Bel(green) does not have to equal Bel(red or green).

Thus, Bayes&#x27; conditional probability can be considered as a special case of Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination. However, it lacks many (if not most) of the properties that make Bayes&#x27; rule intuitively desirable, leading some to argue that it cannot be considered a generalization in any meaningful sense. For example, DS theory violates the requirements for Cox&#x27;s theorem, which implies that it cannot be considered a coherent (contradiction-free) generalization of classical logic—specifically, DS theory violates the requirement that a statement be either true or false (but not both). As a result, DS theory is subject to the Dutch Book argument, implying that any agent using DS theory would agree to a series of bets that result in a guaranteed loss.

==Bayesian approximation==
The Bayesian approximation reduces a given bpa formula_23 to a (discrete) probability distribution, i.e. only singleton subsets of the frame of discernment are allowed to be focal elements of the approximated version formula_24 of formula_23:

:formula_26

It&#x27;s useful for those who are only interested in the single state hypothesis.

We can perform it in the &#x27;light&#x27; example.

==Criticism==
Judea Pearl (1988a, chapter 9; 1988b and 1990) has argued that it is misleading to interpret belief functions as representing either &quot;probabilities of an event,&quot; or &quot;the confidence one has in the probabilities assigned to various outcomes,&quot; or &quot;degrees of belief (or confidence, or trust) in a proposition,&quot; or &quot;degree of ignorance in a situation.&quot; Instead, belief
functions represent the probability that a given proposition is &quot;provable&quot; from a set of other propositions, to which probabilities are assigned. Confusing probabilities of &quot;truth&quot; with probabilities of &quot;provability&quot; may lead to counterintuitive results in reasoning tasks such as (1) representing incomplete knowledge, (2) belief-updating and (3) evidence pooling. He further demonstrated that, if partial knowledge is encoded and updated by belief function methods, the resulting beliefs cannot serve as a basis for rational decisions.

Kłopotek and Wierzchoń proposed to interpret the Dempster–Shafer theory in terms of statistics of decision tables (of the rough set theory), whereby the operator of combining evidence should be seen as relational joining of decision tables. In another interpretation M. A. Kłopotek and S. T. Wierzchoń propose to view this theory as describing destructive material processing (under loss of properties), e.g. like in some semiconductor production processes. Under both interpretations reasoning in DST gives correct results, contrary to the earlier probabilistic interpretations, criticized by Pearl in the cited papers and by other researchers.

Jøsang proved that Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination actually is a method for fusing belief constraints. It only represents an approximate fusion operator in other situations, such as cumulative fusion of beliefs, but generally produces incorrect results in such situations. The confusion around the validity of Dempster&#x27;s rule therefore originates in the failure of correctly interpreting the nature of situations to be modeled. Dempster&#x27;s rule of combination always produces correct and intuitive results in situation of fusing belief constraints from different sources.

==Relational measures==
In considering preferences one might use the partial order of a lattice instead of the total order of the real line as found in Dempster–Schafer theory. Indeed, Gunther Schmidt has proposed this modification and outlined the method.

Given a set of criteria &quot;C&quot; and a bounded lattice &quot;L&quot; with ordering ≤, Schmidt defines a relational measure to be a function &quot;μ&quot; from the power set of &quot;C&quot; into &quot;L&quot; that respects the order ⊆ on formula_27(&quot;C&quot;): 
:formula_28
and such that &quot;μ&quot; takes the empty subset of formula_27(&quot;C&quot;) to the least element of &quot;L&quot;, and takes &quot;C&quot; to the greatest element of &quot;L&quot;.

Schmidt compares &quot;μ&quot; with the belief function of Schafer, and he also considers a method of combining measures generalizing the approach of Dempster (when new evidence is combined with previously held evidence). He also introduces a &quot;relational integral&quot; and compares it to the Choquet integral and Sugeno integral. Any relation &quot;m&quot; between &quot;C&quot; and &quot;L&quot; may be introduced as a &quot;direct valuation&quot;, then processed with the calculus of relations to obtain a &quot;possibility measure&quot; &quot;μ&quot;.

<text>About Schmidt is a 2002 American comedy-drama film co-written and directed by Alexander Payne and starring Jack Nicholson in the title role. The film also stars Hope Davis, Dermot Mulroney, and Kathy Bates. It is loosely based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Louis Begley. After it was released in theaters by New Line Cinema on December 13, 2002, the film enjoyed both critical and commercial success, earning $105.8 million on a $30 million budget.

==Plot==
Warren Schmidt is retiring from his position as an actuary with Woodmen of the World, a life insurance company in Omaha, Nebraska. After a retirement dinner, Schmidt finds it hard to adjust to his new life, feeling useless.

Warren sees a television advertisement about a foster program for African children, Plan USA, and decides to sponsor a child. He soon receives an information package with a photo of his foster child, a small Tanzanian boy named Ndugu Umbo, to whom he relates his life in a series of candid, rambling letters.

Schmidt visits his young successor at the life insurance company to offer his help, but he is politely declined. As he leaves the building, Schmidt sees the contents and files of his office, his entire career, set out for the garbage. He describes to Ndugu his longtime alienation from Helen, his wife, who dies from a blood clot in her brain just after their purchase of a Winnebago Adventurer motor home.

Jeannie, their daughter, and her fiancé, Randall Hertzel, a waterbed salesman, arrive from Denver. Consoling him at the funeral, she later berates him for taking his wife for granted, refusing to fully pay for the Winnebago (he wanted the cheaper model) and getting her a cheap casket. He asks her to move back to take care of him, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Randall tries to rope him into a pyramid scheme.

Schmidt feels his daughter could do better than Randall. After they leave, Schmidt is overcome by loneliness. He stops showering, sleeps in front of the television, and goes shopping with a coat over pajamas to load up on frozen foods. When he discovers hidden love letters disclosing Helen&#x27;s long-ago affair with Ray, a mutual friend, Schmidt collects all her possessions and dumps them unceremoniously next to a clothing donations bin. He then confronts Ray for his betrayal.

Deciding to take a journey in the new Winnebago to visit his daughter and convince her not to marry Randall, he tells her he is coming early for the wedding. She makes it clear she does not want him there until right before the ceremony, so Schmidt visits places from his past, including his college campus and fraternity at University of Kansas and his hometown in Holdrege, Nebraska. His childhood home is now a tire shop.

At a trailer campground, he is invited to dinner by a friendly and sympathetic couple, John and Vicki Rusk. When John goes for beer, Schmidt makes a pass at Vicki, who tells him to leave immediately. Sitting on the roof of his RV on a starry night, Schmidt forgives his departed wife for her affair, apologizing to her for his own failings. At that moment, he is amazed to see a bright meteor streak across the sky, taking it as a possible sign from Helen.

Feeling full of purpose and energetic renewal, Schmidt arrives in Denver, where he stays at the home of Roberta, Randall&#x27;s mother. He is appalled by her eccentric, odd, lower-middle-class family and cannot dissuade Jeannie from the marriage. Schmidt throws out his back after sleeping on Randall&#x27;s waterbed, infuriating Jeannie. Roberta assures him that a soak in her hot tub will help his back, but he flees after she makes a pass at him in the tub. The next day, Schmidt, exhausted from a restless night, attends the wedding and delivers a kind speech at the reception, hiding his disapproval.

On his way home, Schmidt composes a letter to Ndugu. He questions his life&#x27;s accomplishments, lamenting that he will soon be dead, that his life has made no difference to anyone, and that eventually it will be as if he has never existed at all.

A pile of mail is waiting for him at home. Schmidt opens a letter from Tanzania. It is from a nun, who writes that Ndugu is six and unable to read and reply to Schmidt&#x27;s letters on his own, but appreciates them and Schmidt&#x27;s financial support very much. An enclosed simple crayon drawing, of Ndugu and Schmidt holding hands on a sunny day, moves Schmidt to tears.

==Cast==
==Production==
Alexander Payne&#x27;s script to &quot;About Schmidt&quot; was initially an original screenplay written years before Louis Begley&#x27;s novel was published. According to Payne, his script was about &quot;an old guy who retires, and realizes how much he’s wasted his life, and wants somehow to start anew— &quot;The Graduate&quot; at age sixty-five.&quot; Payne’s original script was titled &quot;The Coward&quot;. Payne completed the script in 1991 and offered it to Universal Pictures, but the studio rejected it. Following the publication of Begley&#x27;s novel in 1996, Payne decided to combine his script with the plot of the novel, thus making it an adaptation. Payne made many changes from the book, though Begley commented in an essay in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;my most important themes were treated with great intelligence and sensitivity&quot; and felt the movie was &quot;a gem of original filmmaking.&quot;

Filming began in March 2001 and took place in several Nebraska cities, including Omaha, Nebraska City, Minden, Kearney, and Lincoln. Omaha was chosen because it was where Payne grew up. At least one scene was filmed in Denver where Jack Nicholson&#x27;s character is driving in front of the famous Ogden Theater located at 935 E Colfax. Filming concluded in May 2001.

Before agreeing to the nude hot tub scene, Kathy Bates said she hashed out with director Payne exactly what part of her anatomy would be shown and what wouldn&#x27;t. &quot;I battled to make myself comfortable, and he battled to get what he wanted. We met in the middle.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
In the United States, the film grossed $8,533,162 on its opening weekend. Its total U.S. box office gross stands at $65,005,217, while total worldwide gross totals $107,054,484.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;About Schmidt&quot; drew praise from a number of critics, who singled out the performances of Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates. Film website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 85% based on 203 reviews, with an average rating of 7.71/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;In this funny, touching character study, Nicholson gives one of the best performances of his career.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave &quot;About Schmidt&quot; three-and-a-half out of four stars and wrote the following for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;: &quot;About Schmidt&quot; &quot;is essentially a portrait of a man without qualities, baffled by the emotions and needs of others. That Jack Nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft, but to his legend: Jack is so unlike Schmidt that his performance generates a certain awe. Another actor might have made the character too tragic or passive or empty, but Nicholson somehow finds within Schmidt a slowly developing hunger, a desire to start living now that the time is almost gone.&quot;

Michael Rechtshaffen of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a commanding Jack Nicholson lead performance that puts it into a sublime league of its own.&quot; Paul Clinton of CNN.com wrote: &quot;&quot;About Schmidt&quot; is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year. If you&#x27;re not deeply touched by this movie, check your pulse.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
Upon accepting his Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama, Nicholson stated, &quot;I&#x27;m a little surprised. I thought we made a comedy.&quot;

It was also part of the Official Competition Selection at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.

== Home media ==
&quot;About Schmidt&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on June 3, 2003 by New Line Home Entertainment. It was released on Blu-ray for the first time on February 3, 2015.

<doc id="226666" wikidata="Q3390227" url="?curid=226666" title="Chucho Castillo">
<text>Jesús Castillo Aguilera (June 17, 1944 – January 15, 2013) was a Mexican professional boxer. Better known as Chucho Castillo, he was the Lineal, WBA and WBC bantamweight world champion in 1970.

Castillo and Rubén Olivares sustained one of the most important rivalries in the history of Mexican boxing. Castillo was described by the boxing book &quot;The Ring: Boxing In The 20th Century&quot; as quiet and sullen, while Olivares was more of an outgoing partygoer, according to the book. The personality contrast made fans very interested in their matches.

==Early career==
Castillo was born in Nuevo Valle de Moreno, a small town in the municipality of León, Guanajuato, Mexico. He made his professional debut on 26 April 1962 against Carlos Navarrete, suffering his first loss by a decision after six rounds. His next bout was his first win, outpointing Arnulfo Daza in eight rounds. Castillo built a record of 24 wins and 7 losses, with 11 knockout wins, before facing José Medel for the Mexican Bantamweight title on 29 April 1967. He won the title on points after the twelve rounds, retaining it twice and also winning an additional seven non-title bouts before his first world title challenge. Among the fighters he beat during that streak were Jesus Pimentel and Memo Tellez, who had beaten Castillo twice before.

===Lineal, WBC &amp; WBA Bantamweight Championship===
Castillo made his first world title attempt against Australia&#x27;s Lionel Rose, the first Aborigine ever to win a world title. The fight was held on 6 December 1968 at the Forum in Inglewood, where Rose won a very unpopular fifteen-round decision in front of a decidedly pro-Castillo crowd, causing a riot. Castillo had eight bouts in 1969, going 5-1-2 during that period. He beat future world champion Rafael Herrera to defend his Mexican title, had a ten-round draw in Tokyo with Ushiwakamaru Harada, drew with Medel, and split two decisions with Raul Cruz.

===Castillo vs. Olivares===
In 1970, Castillo was given a second world title chance when he and Olivares clashed to begin their three fight rivalry, with all three fights taking place at the Forum in Inglewood. On 18 April, Olivares retained the crown by outpointing over Castillo. However, a rematch between the two fighters took place on 16 October. Castillo cut Olivares in round one, and when it was determined that Olivares could not continue in Round 14, Castillo was declared winner by a technical knockout, winning the world bantamweight championship. After one non-title win, Castillo met Olivares for a third time on 3 April 1971, when Olivares recovered the crown by outpointing Castillo despite suffering an early knockdown.

====Later in career====
Castillo went on fighting until 1975, but his record from the third Olivares fight until his retirement was a rather ordinary one of 5 wins and 7 losses. He lost to former or future world champions Enrique Pinder, Bobby Chacon, and Danny &quot;Little Red&quot; Lopez. After losing to Ernesto Herrera on 12 December 1975, he retired.

==Professional boxing record==

==Death==
Castillo passed away at the age of 68 in Mexico City due to complications from a surgery.

<doc id="226669" wikidata="Q615305" url="?curid=226669" title="Pocket veto">
<text>A pocket veto is a legislative maneuver that allows a president or other official with veto power to exercise that power over a bill by taking no action (&quot;keeping it in their pocket&quot;), thus effectively killing the bill without affirmatively vetoing it. This depends on the laws of each country; the common alternative is that if the president takes no action a bill automatically becomes law.

==Barbados==
Similar to India [see India below], section 58 of the Constitution of Barbados, as amended by the Constitution Amendment Act 2021 (which transitioned the country from a Commonwealth realm to a parliamentary republic with its own head of state) states that the President shall declare his assent to a bill passed by Parliament or withhold his assent. However, much like in India, the Barbadian Constitution does not give a specific time frame for presidential action on a bill sent by the Parliament. Thus, by indefinitely postponing action on a bill, and not sending it back to Parliament, the president could effectively veto it.

==Finland==
The President of Finland has the power to pocket-veto bills passed by the parliament; however, such vetoes are temporary in effect.

==India==
Article 111 of the Indian constitution states that the President shall declare his assent to a bill passed by both houses of Parliament or withhold his assent, provided that may he return the bill to Parliament for reconsideration. If the President returns the bill, and Parliament passes it once again, with or without any amendments, the President cannot withhold his assent. However, the Indian Constitution does not give a specific time frame for presidential action on a bill sent by the Parliament. Thus, by indefinitely postponing action on a bill, and not sending it back to Parliament, the president effectively vetoes it. Zail Singh, the President of India from 1982 until 1987, exercised a pocket veto to prevent the Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill from becoming law.

==United States==
Normally if a president does not sign a bill, it becomes law after ten days as if they had signed it. A pocket veto occurs when a bill fails to become law because the president does not sign it within the ten-day period and cannot return the bill to Congress because Congress is no longer in session. Article 1, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution states:

If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a Law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a Law.

The Constitution limits the president&#x27;s period for decision on whether to sign or return any legislation to ten days (not including Sundays) while the United States Congress is in session. A return veto happens when the president sends a bill, along with their objections, back to the house of Congress from which it originated. Congress can override the veto by a two-thirds vote of both chambers, whereupon the bill becomes law. If Congress prevents the bill&#x27;s return by adjourning during the 10-day period, and the president does not sign the bill, a &quot;pocket veto&quot; occurs and the bill does not become law. Congress can adjourn and designate an agent to receive veto messages and other communications so that a pocket veto cannot happen, an action Congresses have routinely taken for decades. If a bill is pocket vetoed while Congress is out of session, the only way for Congress to circumvent the pocket veto is to reintroduce the legislation as a new bill, pass it through both chambers, and present it to the President again for signature. James Madison became the first president to use the pocket veto in 1812.

Of presidents throughout United States history, Franklin D. Roosevelt had an outstanding number of pocket vetoes, more than anyone before or after him. During his presidency from 1933 to 1945 Roosevelt had vetoed 635 bills, 263 of which were pocket vetoes. All presidents after him until George W. Bush had pocket vetoes while they were in office; the most after Roosevelt was Dwight D. Eisenhower who had 108. Since the George W. Bush presidency, no president has used the pocket veto. Ten presidents from founding to 1886 did not use this tactic.

===Legal status===
Courts have never fully clarified when an adjournment by Congress would &quot;prevent&quot; the president from returning a vetoed bill. Some presidents have interpreted the Constitution to restrict the pocket veto to the adjournment sine die of Congress at the end of the second session of the two-year congressional term, while others interpreted it to allow intersession and intrasession pocket vetoes. In 1929, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the Pocket Veto Case that a bill had to be returned to the chamber while it is in session and capable of work. While upholding President Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s pocket veto, the court said that the &quot;determinative question is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment but whether it is one that &#x27;prevents&#x27; the President from returning the bill&quot;. In 1938, the Supreme Court reversed itself in part in &quot;Wright v. United States&quot;, ruling that Congress could designate agents on its behalf to receive veto messages when it was not in session, saying that the Constitution &quot;does not define what shall constitute a return of a bill or deny the use of appropriate agencies in effecting the return&quot;. A three-day recess of the Senate was considered a short enough time that the Senate could still act with &quot;reasonable promptitude&quot; on the veto. However, a five-month adjournment would be a long enough period to enable a pocket veto. Within those constraints, there still exists some ambiguity. Presidents have been reluctant to pursue disputed pocket vetoes to the Supreme Court for fear of an adverse ruling that would serve as a precedent in future cases.

===George W. Bush===
In December 2007, President George W. Bush claimed that he had pocket vetoed , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, even though the House of Representatives had designated agents to receive presidential messages before adjourning. The bill had been previously passed by veto-proof majorities in both the House and the Senate. If the president had chosen to veto the bill, he would have been required to return it to the chamber in which it originated, in this case the House of Representatives. The House then could have voted to override the veto, and the Senate could have done likewise. If each house had voted to override the veto, then the bill would have become law.

Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated: &quot;Congress vigorously rejects any claim that the president has the authority to pocket veto this legislation and will treat any bill returned to the Congress as open to an override vote.&quot; On January 1, 2008, Deputy Assistant to the President and White House Deputy Press Secretary Scott Stanzel stated: &quot;A pocket veto, as you know, is essentially putting it in your pocket and not taking any action whatsoever. And when Congress – the House is out of session – in this case it&#x27;s our view that bill then would not become law.&quot;

Louis Fisher, a constitutional scholar at the Library of Congress indicated: &quot;The administration would be on weak grounds in court because they would be insisting on what the Framers decidedly rejected: an absolute veto.&quot; By &quot;absolute veto&quot; Fisher was referring to the fact that a bill that has been pocket vetoed cannot have its veto overridden. Instead, the bill must be reintroduced into both houses of Congress, and again passed by both houses, an effort which can be very difficult to achieve.

In the end, the House of Representatives did not attempt to override the veto. Instead, in January 2008, the House effectively killed H.R. 1585 by referring the pocket veto message to the Armed Services Committee and passing , a bill nearly identical to H.R. 1585 but slightly modified to meet the President&#x27;s objection, which subsequently became law.

This was not the first time that a president has attempted to pocket veto a bill despite the presence of agents to receive his veto message. Both George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton made similar attempts, and Abraham Lincoln used it against the Wade–Davis Bill in 1864.

=== State legislatures ===
Across the country, pocket veto powers are not uncommon in committees of state legislatures, which allows a committee to &quot;kill&quot; a bill, sometimes without even a public vote; in Colorado, the power was notably repealed in a citizen initiative constitutional amendment in 1988 driven by various reform groups.

When a committee refuses to vote a bill out of committee, a discharge petition can be passed by the broader membership. The specifics vary from state to state; for example, in 2004, a report found that New York State places more restrictions than any other state legislature on motions to discharge a bill from a committee, which led to subsequent reforms.

===Indiana===
After nearly a century of pocket vetoes, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled pocket vetoes unconstitutional in 1969. Governor Edgar Whitcomb requested that the General Assembly pass an act repealing all laws that were enacted because of the Supreme Court decision, some of which were nearly a century old. The assembly complied with the request and passed a blanket repeal.

==Other use==
Because a pocket veto cannot be overridden, it is sometimes used to describe situations where either one person, or a small group, can override the will of a much larger group without consequence. For example, when the California Supreme Court was answering the certified question of intervenor standing in the case of &quot;Perry v. Brown&quot; (known as the Proposition 8 case), one of the justices expressed concern that denying appellate standing to initiative proponents would mean that the governor and state attorney general would &quot;essentially get a &#x27;pocket veto.

<text>In scientific research, the null hypothesis (often denoted &quot;H&quot;0) is the claim that the effect being studied does not exist. The null hypothesis can also be described as the hypothesis in which no relationship exists between two sets of data or variables being analyzed. If the null hypothesis is true, any experimentally observed effect is due to chance alone, hence the term &quot;null&quot;. In contrast with the null hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis is developed, which claims that a relationship does exist between two variables.

==Basic definitions==
The null hypothesis and the &quot;alternative hypothesis&quot; are types of conjectures used in statistical tests to make statistical inferences, which are formal methods of reaching conclusions and separating scientific claims from statistical noise. 

The statement being tested in a test of statistical significance is called the null hypothesis. The test of significance is designed to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis, or a statement of &#x27;no effect&#x27; or &#x27;no difference&#x27;. It is often symbolized as &quot;H&quot;0.

The statement that is being tested against the null hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis. Symbols may include &quot;H&quot;1 and &quot;H&quot;a.

A statistical significance test starts with a random sample from a population. If the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis, then you do not reject the null hypothesis; if the sample data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis, then you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true.

Consider the following example. Given the test scores of two random samples, one of men and one of women, does one group score better than the other? A possible null hypothesis is that the mean male score is the same as the mean female score:

: &quot;H&quot;0: &quot;μ&quot;1 = &quot;μ&quot;2

where

: &quot;H&quot;0 = the null hypothesis,
: &quot;μ&quot;1 = the mean of population 1, and
: &quot;μ&quot;2 = the mean of population 2.

A stronger null hypothesis is that the two samples have equal variances and shapes of their respective distributions.

==Terminology==
; Simple hypothesis : Any hypothesis which specifies the population distribution completely. For such a hypothesis the sampling distribution of any statistic is a function of the sample size alone.
; Composite hypothesis : Any hypothesis which does &quot;not&quot; specify the population distribution completely. Example: A hypothesis specifying a normal distribution with a specified mean and an unspecified variance.

The simple/composite distinction was made by Neyman and Pearson.

; Exact hypothesis: Any hypothesis that specifies an exact parameter value. Example: μ = 100. Synonym: point hypothesis.
; Inexact hypothesis : Those specifying a parameter range or interval. Examples: μ ≤ 100; 95 ≤ μ ≤ 105.

Fisher required an exact null hypothesis for testing (see the quotations below).

A one-tailed hypothesis (tested using a one-sided test) is an inexact hypothesis in which the value of a parameter is specified as being either:
* above or equal to a certain value, or
* below or equal to a certain value.
A one-tailed hypothesis is said to have directionality.

Fisher&#x27;s original (lady tasting tea) example was a one-tailed test. The null hypothesis was asymmetric. The probability of guessing all cups correctly was the same as guessing all cups incorrectly, but Fisher noted that only guessing correctly was compatible with the lady&#x27;s claim.

==Technical description==
The null hypothesis is a default hypothesis that a quantity to be measured is zero (null). Typically, the quantity to be measured is the difference between two situations. For instance, trying to determine if there is a positive proof that an effect has occurred or that samples derive from different batches.

The null hypothesis is generally assumed to remain possibly true. Multiple analyses can be performed to show how the hypothesis should either be rejected or excluded e.g. having a high confidence level, thus demonstrating a statistically significant difference. This is demonstrated by showing that zero is outside of the specified confidence interval of the measurement on either side, typically within the real numbers. Failure to exclude the null hypothesis (with any confidence) does not logically confirm or support the (unprovable) null hypothesis. (When it is proven that something is e.g. bigger than &quot;x&quot;, it does not necessarily imply it is plausible that it is smaller or equal than &quot;x&quot;; it may instead be a poor quality measurement with low accuracy. Confirming the null hypothesis two-sided would amount to positively proving it is bigger or equal than 0 &quot;and&quot; to positively proving it is smaller or equal than 0; this is something for which infinite accuracy is needed as well as exactly zero effect, neither of which normally are realistic. Also measurements will never indicate a non-zero probability of exactly zero difference.) So failure of an exclusion of a null hypothesis amounts to a &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot; at the specified confidence level; it does not immediately imply null somehow, as the data may already show a (less strong) indication for a non-null. The used confidence level does absolutely certainly not correspond to the likelihood of null at failing to exclude; in fact in this case a high used confidence level &quot;expands&quot; the still plausible range.

A non-null hypothesis can have the following meanings, depending on the author a) a value other than zero is used, b) some margin other than zero is used and c) the &quot;alternative&quot; hypothesis.

Testing (excluding or failing to exclude) the null hypothesis provides evidence that there are (or are not) statistically sufficient grounds to believe there &quot;is&quot; a relationship between two phenomena (e.g., that a potential treatment has a non-zero effect, either way). Testing the null hypothesis is a central task in statistical hypothesis testing in the modern practice of science. There are precise criteria for excluding or not excluding a null hypothesis at a certain confidence level. The confidence level should indicate the likelihood that much more and better data would still be able to exclude the null hypothesis on the same side.

The concept of a null hypothesis is used differently in two approaches to statistical inference. In the significance testing approach of Ronald Fisher, a null hypothesis is rejected if the observed data are significantly unlikely to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true. In this case, the null hypothesis is rejected and an alternative hypothesis is accepted in its place. If the data are consistent with the null hypothesis statistically possibly true, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. In neither case is the null hypothesis or its alternative proven; with better or more data, the null may still be rejected. This is analogous to the legal principle of presumption of innocence, in which a suspect or defendant is assumed to be innocent (null is not rejected) until proven guilty (null is rejected) beyond a reasonable doubt (to a statistically significant degree).

In the hypothesis testing approach of Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, a null hypothesis is contrasted with an alternative hypothesis, and the two hypotheses are distinguished on the basis of data, with certain error rates. It is used in formulating answers in research.

Statistical inference can be done without a null hypothesis, by specifying a statistical model corresponding to each candidate hypothesis, and by using model selection techniques to choose the most appropriate model. (The most common selection techniques are based on either Akaike information criterion or Bayes factor).

==Principle==
Hypothesis testing requires constructing a statistical model of what the data would look like if chance or random processes alone were responsible for the results. The hypothesis that chance alone is responsible for the results is called the &quot;null hypothesis&quot;. The model of the result of the random process is called the &quot;distribution under the null hypothesis&quot;. The obtained results are compared with the distribution under the null hypothesis, and the likelihood of finding the obtained results is thereby determined.

Hypothesis testing works by collecting data and measuring how likely the particular set of data is (assuming the null hypothesis is true), when the study is on a randomly selected representative sample. The null hypothesis assumes no relationship between variables in the population from which the sample is selected.

If the data-set of a randomly selected representative sample is very unlikely relative to the null hypothesis (defined as being part of a class of sets of data that only rarely will be observed), the experimenter rejects the null hypothesis, concluding it (probably) is false. This class of data-sets is usually specified via a test statistic, which is designed to measure the extent of apparent departure from the null hypothesis. The procedure works by assessing whether the observed departure, measured by the test statistic, is larger than a value defined, so that the probability of occurrence of a more extreme value is small under the null hypothesis (usually in less than either 5% or 1% of similar data-sets in which the null hypothesis does hold).

If the data do not contradict the null hypothesis, then only a weak conclusion can be made: namely, that the observed data set provides insufficient evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, because the null hypothesis could be true or false, in some contexts this is interpreted as meaning that the data give insufficient evidence to make any conclusion, while in other contexts, it is interpreted as meaning that there is not sufficient evidence to support changing from a currently useful regime to a different one. Nevertheless, if at this point the effect appears likely and/or large enough, there may be an incentive to further investigate, such as running a bigger sample.

For instance, a certain drug may reduce the risk of having a heart attack. Possible null hypotheses are &quot;this drug does not reduce the risk of having a heart attack&quot; or &quot;this drug has no effect on the risk of having a heart attack&quot;. The test of the hypothesis consists of administering the drug to half of the people in a study group as a controlled experiment. If the data show a statistically significant change in the people receiving the drug, the null hypothesis is rejected.

==Goals of null hypothesis tests==
There are many types of significance tests for one, two or more samples, for means, variances and proportions, paired or unpaired data, for different distributions, for large and small samples; all have null hypotheses. There are also at least four goals of null hypotheses for significance tests:
* Technical null hypotheses are used to verify statistical assumptions. For example, the residuals between the data and a statistical model cannot be distinguished from random noise. If true, there is no justification for complicating the model.
* Scientific null assumptions are used to directly advance a theory. For example, the angular momentum of the universe is zero. If not true, the theory of the early universe may need revision.
* Null hypotheses of homogeneity are used to verify that multiple experiments are producing consistent results. For example, the effect of a medication on the elderly is consistent with that of the general adult population. If true, this strengthens the general effectiveness conclusion and simplifies recommendations for use.
* Null hypotheses that assert the equality of effect of two or more alternative treatments, for example, a drug and a placebo, are used to reduce scientific claims based on statistical noise. This is the most popular null hypothesis; It is so popular that many statements about significant testing assume such null hypotheses.

Rejection of the null hypothesis is &quot;not necessarily&quot; the real goal of a significance tester. An adequate statistical model may be associated with a failure to reject the null; the model is adjusted until the null is not rejected. The numerous uses of significance testing were well known to Fisher who discussed many in his book written a decade before defining the null hypothesis.

A statistical significance test shares much mathematics with a confidence interval. They are mutually illuminating. A result is often significant when there is confidence in the sign of a relationship (the interval does not include 0). Whenever the sign of a relationship is important, statistical significance is a worthy goal. This also reveals weaknesses of significance testing: A result can be significant without a good estimate of the strength of a relationship; significance can be a modest goal. A weak relationship can also achieve significance with enough data. Reporting both significance and confidence intervals is commonly recommended.

The varied uses of significance tests reduce the number of generalizations that can be made about all applications.

==Choice of the null hypothesis==
The choice of the null hypothesis is associated with sparse and inconsistent advice. Fisher mentioned few constraints on the choice and stated that many null hypotheses should be considered and that many tests are possible for each. The variety of applications and the diversity of goals suggests that the choice can be complicated. In many applications the formulation of the test is traditional. A familiarity with the range of tests available may suggest a particular null hypothesis and test. Formulating the null hypothesis is not automated (though the calculations of significance testing usually are). David Cox said, &quot;How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis&quot;.

A statistical significance test is intended to test a hypothesis. If the hypothesis summarizes a set of data, there is no value in testing the hypothesis on that set of data. Example: If a study of last year&#x27;s weather reports indicates that rain in a region falls primarily on weekends, it is only valid to test that null hypothesis on weather reports from any &quot;other&quot; year. Testing hypotheses suggested by the data is circular reasoning that proves nothing; It is a special limitation on the choice of the null hypothesis.

A routine procedure is as follows: Start from the scientific hypothesis. Translate this to a statistical alternative hypothesis and proceed: &quot;Because Ha expresses the effect that we wish to find evidence for, we often begin with Ha and then set up H0 as the statement that the hoped-for effect is not present.&quot; This advice is &quot;reversed&quot; for modeling applications where we hope not to find evidence against the null.

A complex case example is as follows: The gold standard in clinical research is the randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. But testing a new drug against a (medically ineffective) placebo may be unethical for a serious illness. Testing a new drug against an older medically effective drug raises fundamental philosophical issues regarding the goal of the test and the motivation of the experimenters. The standard &quot;no difference&quot; null hypothesis may reward the pharmaceutical company for gathering inadequate data. &quot;Difference&quot; is a better null hypothesis in this case, but statistical significance is not an adequate criterion for reaching a nuanced conclusion which requires a good numeric estimate of the drug&#x27;s effectiveness. A &quot;minor&quot; or &quot;simple&quot; proposed change in the null hypothesis ((new vs old) rather than (new vs placebo)) can have a dramatic effect on the utility of a test for complex non-statistical reasons.

===Directionality===

The choice of null hypothesis (&quot;H&quot;0) and consideration of directionality (see &quot;one-tailed test&quot;) is critical.

====Tailedness of the null-hypothesis test====
Consider the question of whether a tossed coin is fair (i.e. that on average it lands heads up 50% of the time) and an experiment where you toss the coin 5 times.
A possible result of the experiment that we consider here is 5 heads. Let outcomes be considered unlikely with respect to an assumed distribution if their probability is lower than a significance threshold of 0.05.

A potential null hypothesis implying a one-tailed test is &quot;this coin is not biased toward heads&quot;. Beware that, in this context, the term &quot;one-tailed&quot; does &quot;not&quot; refer to the outcome of a single coin toss (i.e., whether or not the coin comes up &quot;tails&quot; instead of &quot;heads&quot;); the term &quot;one-tailed&quot; refers to a specific way of testing the null hypothesis in which the critical region (also known as &quot;region of rejection&quot;) ends up in on only one side of the probability distribution.

Indeed, with a fair coin the probability of this experiment outcome is 1/25 = 0.031, which would be even lower if the coin were biased in favour of tails. 
Therefore, the observations are not likely enough for the null hypothesis to hold, and the test refutes it. 
Since the coin is ostensibly neither fair nor biased toward tails, the conclusion of the experiment is that the coin is biased towards heads.

Alternatively, a null hypothesis implying a two-tailed test is &quot;this coin is fair&quot;. 
This one null hypothesis could be examined by looking out for either too many tails or too many heads in the experiments.
The outcomes that would tend to refute this null hypothesis are those with a large number of heads or a large number of tails, and our experiment with 5 heads would seem to belong to this class.

However, the probability of 5 tosses of the same kind, irrespective of whether these are head or tails, is twice as much as that of the 5-head occurrence singly considered.
Hence, under this two-tailed null hypothesis, the observation receives a probability value of 0.063.
Hence again, with the same significance threshold used for the one-tailed test (0.05), the same outcome is not statistically significant.
Therefore, the two-tailed null hypothesis will be preserved in this case, not supporting the conclusion reached with the single-tailed null hypothesis, that the coin is biased towards heads.

This example illustrates that the conclusion reached from a statistical test may depend on the precise formulation of the null and alternative hypotheses.

====Discussion====
Fisher said, &quot;the null hypothesis must be exact, that is free of vagueness and ambiguity, because it must supply the basis of the &#x27;problem of distribution,&#x27; of which the test of significance is the solution&quot;, implying a more restrictive domain for &quot;H&quot;0. According to this view, the null hypothesis must be numerically exact—it must state that a particular quantity or difference is equal to a particular number. In classical science, it is most typically the statement that there is &quot;no effect&quot; of a particular treatment; in observations, it is typically that there is &quot;no difference&quot; between the value of a particular measured variable and that of a prediction.

Most statisticians believe that it is valid to state direction as a part of null hypothesis, or as part of a null hypothesis/alternative hypothesis pair. However, the results are not a full description of all the results of an experiment, merely a single result tailored to one particular purpose. For example, consider an &quot;H&quot;0 that claims the population mean for a new treatment is an improvement on a well-established treatment with population (known from long experience), with the one-tailed alternative being that the new treatment&#x27;s . If the sample evidence obtained through &quot;x&quot;-bar equals −200 and the corresponding t-test statistic equals −50, the conclusion from the test would be that there is no evidence that the new treatment is better than the existing one: it would not report that it is markedly worse, but that is not what this particular test is looking for. To overcome any possible ambiguity in reporting the result of the test of a null hypothesis, it is best to indicate whether the test was two-sided and, if one-sided, to include the direction of the effect being tested.

The statistical theory required to deal with the simple cases of directionality dealt with here, and more complicated ones, makes use of the concept of an unbiased test.

The directionality of hypotheses is not always obvious. The explicit null hypothesis of Fisher&#x27;s Lady tasting tea example was that the Lady had no such ability, which led to a symmetric probability distribution. The one-tailed nature of the test resulted from the one-tailed alternate hypothesis (a term not used by Fisher). The null hypothesis became implicitly one-tailed. The logical negation of the Lady&#x27;s one-tailed claim was also one-tailed. (Claim: Ability &gt; 0; Stated null: Ability = 0; Implicit null: Ability ≤ 0).

Pure arguments over the use of one-tailed tests are complicated by the variety of tests. Some tests (for instance the χ2 goodness of fit test) are inherently one-tailed. Some probability distributions are asymmetric. The traditional tests of 3 or more groups are two-tailed.

Advice concerning the use of one-tailed hypotheses has been inconsistent and accepted practice varies among fields. The greatest objection to one-tailed hypotheses is their potential subjectivity. A non-significant result can sometimes be converted to a significant result by the use of a one-tailed hypothesis (as the fair coin test, at the whim of the analyst). The flip side of the argument: One-sided tests are less likely to ignore a real effect. One-tailed tests can suppress the publication of data that differs in sign from predictions. Objectivity was a goal of the developers of statistical tests.

It is a common practice to use a one-tailed hypothesis by default. However, &quot;If you do not have a specific direction firmly in mind in advance, use a two-sided alternative. Moreover, some users of statistics argue that we should &quot;always&quot; work with the two-sided alternative.&quot;

One alternative to this advice is to use three-outcome tests. It eliminates the issues surrounding directionality of hypotheses by testing twice, once in each direction and combining the results to produce three possible outcomes. Variations on this approach have a history, being suggested perhaps 10 times since 1950.

Disagreements over one-tailed tests flow from the philosophy of science. While Fisher was willing to ignore the unlikely case of the Lady guessing all cups of tea incorrectly (which may have been appropriate for the circumstances), medicine believes that a proposed treatment that kills patients is significant in every sense and should be reported and perhaps explained. Poor statistical reporting practices have contributed to disagreements over one-tailed tests. Statistical significance resulting from two-tailed tests is insensitive to the sign of the relationship; Reporting significance alone is inadequate. &quot;The treatment has an effect&quot; is the uninformative result of a two-tailed test. &quot;The treatment has a beneficial effect&quot; is the more informative result of a one-tailed test. &quot;The treatment has an effect, reducing the average length of hospitalization by 1.5 days&quot; is the most informative report, combining a two-tailed significance test result with a numeric estimate of the relationship between treatment and effect. Explicitly reporting a numeric result eliminates a philosophical advantage of a one-tailed test. An underlying issue is the appropriate form of an experimental science without numeric predictive theories: A model of numeric results is more informative than a model of effect signs (positive, negative or unknown) which is more informative than a model of simple significance (non-zero or unknown); in the absence of numeric theory signs may suffice.

==History of statistical tests==

The history of the null and alternative hypotheses has much to do with the history of statistical tests.

* Before 1925: There are occasional transient traces of statistical tests in past centuries, which were early examples of null hypotheses. In the late 19th century statistical significance was defined. In the early 20th century important probability distributions were defined. Gossett and Pearson worked on specific cases of significance testing.
* 1925: Fisher published the first edition of &quot;Statistical Methods for Research Workers,&quot; which defined the statistical significance test and made it a mainstream method of analysis for much of experimental science. The text was devoid of proofs and weak on explanations, but was filled with real examples. It placed statistical practice in the sciences well in advance of published statistical theory.
* 1933: In a series of papers (published over a decade starting in 1928) Neyman &amp; Pearson defined the statistical hypothesis test as a proposed improvement on Fisher&#x27;s test. The papers provided much of the terminology for statistical tests including &quot;alternative hypothesis&quot; and H0 as a hypothesis to be tested using observational data (with H1, H2... as alternatives). 
* 1935: Fisher published the first edition of the book &quot;The Design of Experiments&quot; which introduced the null hypothesis (by example rather than by definition) and carefully explained the rationale for significance tests in the context of the interpretation of experimental results.
* Fisher and Neyman quarreled over the relative merits of their competing formulations until Fisher&#x27;s death in 1962. Career changes and World War II ended the partnership of Neyman and Pearson. The formulations were merged by relatively anonymous textbook writers, experimenters (journal editors) and mathematical statisticians without input from either Fisher or Neyman. The subject today combines much of the terminology and explanatory power of Neyman &amp; Pearson with the scientific philosophy and calculations provided by Fisher. Whether statistical testing is properly one subject or two remains a source of disagreement. Sample of two: One text refers to the subject as hypothesis testing (with no mention of significance testing in the index) while another says significance testing (with a section on inference as a decision). Fisher developed significance testing as a flexible tool for researchers to weigh their evidence. Instead testing has become institutionalized. Statistical significance has become a rigidly defined and enforced criterion for the publication of experimental results in many scientific journals. In some fields significance testing has become the dominant and nearly exclusive form of statistical analysis. As a consequence the limitations of the tests have been exhaustively studied. Books have been filled with the collected criticism of significance testing.

<doc id="226675" wikidata="Q130838" url="?curid=226675" title="Today (American TV program)">
<text>Today (also called The Today Show) is an American morning television show that airs weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on NBC. The program debuted on January 14, 1952. It was the first of its genre on American television and in the world, and after years of broadcasting it is fifth on the list of longest-running American television series.

Originally a two-hour program airing weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., it expanded to Sundays in 1987 and Saturdays in 1992. The weekday broadcast expanded to three hours in 2000, and to four hours in 2007 (though over time, the third and fourth hours became distinct entities). &quot;Today&quot;″s dominance was virtually unchallenged by the other networks until the late 1980s, when it was overtaken by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

&quot;Today&quot; retook the Nielsen ratings lead the week of December 11, 1995, and held onto that position for 852 consecutive weeks until the week of April 9, 2012, when &quot;Good Morning America&quot; topped it again. &quot;Today&quot; maintained its No. 2 status behind &quot;GMA&quot; from the summer of 2012 until it regained the lead in the aftermath of anchor Matt Lauer&#x27;s departure in November 2017. In 2002, &quot;Today&quot; was ranked No. 17 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.

The entertainment magazine &quot;Variety&quot; reported the 2016 advertising revenue during the first two hours of the show was $508.8 million.

On July 15, 2020, NBC launched &quot;Today&quot; All Day, a 24-hour digital streaming extension of the program available through its website and Peacock.

==History==
===Founding===



The show&#x27;s first broadcast aired on January 14, 1952, as the brainchild of television executive Sylvester Weaver, who was then vice president of NBC. Weaver was president of the company from 1953 to 1956, during which time &quot;Today&quot;″s late-night companion &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; premiered. In pre-production, the show&#x27;s proposed working title was &quot;The Rise and Shine Revue&quot;. The show was first supervised by Jerome Alan Danzig.

&quot;Today&quot; was the first program of its genre when it premiered with original host Dave Garroway. The program blended national news headlines, interviews with newsmakers, lifestyle features, other light news and gimmicks (including the presence of the chimpanzee J. Fred Muggs who served as the show&#x27;s mascot during the early years), and local news updates from the network&#x27;s stations. It has spawned several other shows of a similar type, including ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and CBS&#x27; now-defunct &quot;The Early Show&quot;. In other countries, the format was copied – most notably in the United Kingdom with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; and ITV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, and in Canada with &quot;Your Morning&quot; on CTV Television Network.

===Scheduling history===
When &quot;Today&quot; debuted, it was seen live only in the Eastern Time Zone and Central Time Zone, broadcasting for three hours each morning but seen for only two hours in each time zone. Since 1958, &quot;Today&quot; has only broadcast live on the Eastern Time Zone, and has been on broadcast delay for the five other U.S. time zones (Central, Mountain Time Zone, Pacific Time Zone, Alaska Time Zone and Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone). Partly to accommodate host Dave Garroway&#x27;s declining health, the program ceased live broadcasts in September 1959, opting instead to broadcast an edition taped the previous afternoon punctuated with live newscasts each half-hour. The experiment, which drew criticism from many sides, ended when John Chancellor succeeded Garroway in July 1961.

&quot;Today&quot;″s weekday version was a two-hour program for 48 years, airing from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. in all time zones except for Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, until NBC expanded the program to three hours (extending the program until 10:00 a.m.) on October 2, 2000. A fourth hour (which extended the program until 11:00 a.m.) was eventually added on September 10, 2007.

In August 2013, &quot;Today&quot; released a mobile app for smartphones and tablets.

==Current weekday showtimes and arrangements==
The program airs live in the Eastern Time Zone and on tape delay beginning at 7:00 a.m. in each of the remaining time zones. The remaining three feeds are frequently updated with minor fixes and repairs, and often, correspondents will tape updates that are then edited into the delayed feeds. NBC affiliates in some markets including in the east coast, such as WYFF in Greenville, South Carolina, air the third and fourth hours of &quot;Today&quot; on tape delay to accommodate live syndicated programs airing at such times.

When breaking news stories warrant, &quot;Today&quot; will produce a West Coast edition by broadcasting parts of the show live for viewers there. In such an event, the live portion does not typically go beyond the 7:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) half-hour or the bloc before the first set of advertisements. Once completed, the remaining blocs/segments taped from the East Coast edition will follow. Throughout the live segment, the presenters will explicitly make some reference to the show being live on the west coast from time to time until the tape-delayed segments resume.

In some instances, when an NBC News Special Report of breaking news or a live event occurs during the &quot;Today&quot; show time slot in the eastern time zone, the show&#x27;s anchors will assume hosting responsibilities and the show will go live across all time zones until such time when the Special Report segment finishes. At that point, viewers outside the Eastern Time Zone will return to regularly scheduled programming (i.e. the segment of the &quot;Today&quot; show feed already in progress in their corresponding time zone or their local newscast).

===Local cut-ins===
During the first two hours of the program, local network affiliates are offered a four-minute window at 26 and 56 minutes past the hour to insert a local newsbreak (which usually also includes a local forecast, and in large and mid-sized markets, a brief traffic report) and local advertisements. Certain NBC affiliates that produce an additional morning newscast for a sister station or digital subchannel may prerecord the local inserts aired during the first one to two hours of &quot;Today&quot; to focus production responsibilities on just one of their local channels.

===Satellite radio simulcast===
Starting in June 2014, SiriusXM began simulcasting &quot;Today&quot; on a new channel called Today Show Radio, Channel 108, with &quot;The Best of Today&quot; starting at 6am (Eastern) and the &quot;Today Show&quot;&#x27;s live broadcast from Studio 1A at Rockefeller Center in New York City starting at 7:00 a.m. (Eastern), with a tape delayed broadcast at beginning 7:00 a.m. Pacific time. On Mondays &quot;The Hoda Show&quot; with Hoda Kotb is broadcast exclusive on the Today Show Radio channel. On Tuesdays &quot;Off the Rails&quot; with Al Roker, Dylan Dreyer and Sheinelle Jones airs at 1:00 p.m. (Eastern). On Wednesdays &quot;The Happy Hour&quot; with the producers of &quot;Kathie Lee and Hoda&quot; airs, and on Thursdays &quot;Today Show Confidential&quot; with the producers of &quot;TODAY&quot; airs. The channel also simulcasts &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; with Lester Holt at 6:30 p.m. (Eastern) The Today Show Radio service is not currently available on SiriusXM&#x27;s sister service in Canada and Channel 108 is locked out for Canadian subscribers.

==Studio==
=== RCA Exhibition Hall (original studio) ===
The &quot;Today&quot; program first originated from the RCA Exhibition Hall on 49th Street in Manhattan in a space now occupied by the Christie&#x27;s auction house, just down the block from the present-day studio. The first set placed a functional newsroom in the studio, which Garroway called &quot;the nerve center of the world.&quot; The barrier between backstage and on-stage was virtually nonexistent. Garroway and the on-air staff often walked through the newsroom set. Glimpses of the camera crew and technicians were a frequent occurrence, as were off-screen voices conversing with Garroway. Gradually, machines and personnel were placed behind the scenes to assemble the news and weather reports, and the newsroom was gone by 1955.

=== Studio 3K, Florida Showcase, Studio 8G, and Studio 3B ===

In the summer of 1958, television manufacturer Philco complained to NBC that staging &quot;Today&quot; in a studio explicitly called the RCA Exhibition Hall was unfair (RCA owned NBC at the time). The network bowed to the pressure, and on July 7, 1958, &quot;Today&quot; moved across the street to Studio 3K in the RCA Building, where it remained through the early 1960s.

On July 9, 1962, the program returned to a street-side studio in the space then occupied by the Florida Showcase. Each day, the &quot;Today&quot; production crew would have to move the Florida-related tourism merchandise off the floor and wheel in the &quot;Today&quot; news set, desks, chairs and cameras. When the show wrapped at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, the news set would be put away and the tourism merchandise returned to the floor.

After three years in the Florida Showcase, &quot;Today&quot; moved back to the RCA Building on September 13, 1965. The network converted its news programming to all-color broadcasts at that time, and NBC could not justify allocating four (then-expensive) color cameras to the Florida Showcase studio. For the next 20 years, the show occupied a series of studios on the third, sixth, and eighth floors of NBC&#x27;s headquarters; most notably Studio 3K in the 1970s, Studio 8G (adjacent to Studio 8H, home to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; also the current home of &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;) in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and finally Studio 3B from 1983 to 1994.

=== Studio 1A ===
&quot;Today&quot; moved to the new street-side studio on June 20, 1994, providing a link to the show&#x27;s 1950s origin.

Since the debut of the 1990s set, the national morning news programs of each of the major broadcast and cable-news networks have moved street-side – including two of &quot;Today&quot;″s Rockefeller Center neighbors, Fox News&#x27; &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; (at Sixth Avenue) and CNN&#x27;s since-cancelled &quot;American Morning&quot; (in the summer of 2005, CNN reversed the trend, abandoning its street-level studio and moving upstairs in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle). ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; broadcasts from Times Square Studios, although only a portion of its studio is street side.
In 2006, Studio 1A underwent a major renovation to prepare for the upgrade to high-definition television broadcasts. After the departure of Katie Couric and while a new set was readied (during the summer of 2006), the program was broadcast from a temporary outdoor studio in Rockefeller Plaza, the same set that NBC used at the Olympic Games since 2004. During the week of August 28, 2006, the show was moved to a temporary location outside of Studio 1A because MTV was converting the outdoor studio into their red carpet booth for the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. A mock set was set up in &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;″s studio, which was also used during inclement weather. The program also used a temporary outdoor set at NBC Studios, and MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; (which joined at Studio 1A in 30 Rock on October 22, 2007).

On September 13, 2006, &quot;Today&quot; moved back into the revamped Studio 1A space. The new studio was divided into five different sections on the lower level including an interview area, the couch area, the news desk, the performance/interview/extra space area, and home base, which is where the anchors start the show. A gigantic Panasonic 103-inch plasma display monitor is often used for graphic display backgrounds. A kitchen set is located upstairs from the main studio. The blue background that is seen in the opening of the show in home base moves up and down to allow a view of the outside from the home base.

Some minor changes were implemented throughout the early and middle part of 2013, not only in the way that things are presented, but also with modified graphics and minor updates to the set. That year, a new, larger anchor desk was introduced with space to seat all four main anchors (Guthrie, Lauer, Morales and Roker). The new desk brought an end to the &quot;news desk&quot;, as the third &quot;news reader&quot; (Morales) now sits at the main anchor desk. Other minor changes included a new larger desk for the third hour. After the August 16, 2013, broadcast, the program vacated Studio 1A, while the space underwent a remodeling with a more modern look with (as stated by executive producer Don Nash) &quot;a lot more bells and whistles to play with.&quot;

On September 16, 2013, &quot;Today&quot; debuted a new set and graphics package (it was originally set to debut on September 9, 2013, but was delayed one week to complete final design details). The &quot;home base&quot; is located on a platform that can spin 360°, therefore allowing the view and direction of the camera to change depending on the half-hour. A new couch and background was added in the &quot;sofa area&quot; (where the anchors sit and discuss topics). A social media area known as the &quot;Orange Room,&quot; was also added to Studio 1A, which contains screens that display Twitter comments or trending topics, Carson Daly was hired to present segments from the room during the broadcast. Six screens that also connect to one 6&#x27; x 16&#x27; screen were added in the fashion/special topic area. During its first two days of use, the show transitioned away from its news and entertainment format to a format that emphasized the social interaction of the anchors, Roker and newsreader.

The graphics were also overhauled with introduction of the new set (a slightly modified version of this package and the revised logo debuted on &quot;Early Today&quot; that November, further integrating the early-morning news program&#x27;s branding with &quot;Today&quot;). The logo-to-peacock animation was moved from the left corner to the bottom right side corner of the screen. The logo that was first previewed on September 13, 2013, pared down the number of circular arches from five to three with its coloring switching from different variations – generally shades of red, orange and yellow to depict a sunrise – to entirely orange.

In September 2015 &quot;Today&quot; updated the set once again, the update included new floors, a new couch, and a new anchor desk. The new set retains the 360 home base used in the previous design. The new set replaced much of the dark wood colors with lighter colors and removed the emphasis of orange in previous design in favor of orange accents.

In February 2018, while Guthrie and Kotb were at the 2018 Winter Olympics, the studio received minor changes including new screens and flooring in the former screen area; and by November of the same year, the Orange Room got a minor change that included a triangular-pattern wall and wooden flooring.

====Fourth hour====
Jenna Bush Hager hosts the fourth hour – titled Today with Jenna &amp; Friends – at 10:00a.m. 

* Note: &quot;3rd Hour&quot; and &quot;Jenna &amp; Friends&quot; – while considered extensions of the &quot;Today&quot; show – are their own distinct entities and are listed as such.

=== Weekends ===

Weekend Editions of Today including: Saturday Today are co-anchored by Peter Alexander and Laura Jarrett alongside co-hosts Joe Fryer (features anchor) and Angie Lassman (weather anchor). Sunday Today are anchored by Willie Geist.

===Former staff===
&quot;Today&quot; anchors were termed as &quot;Communicators&quot; on the program&#x27;s inception. Creator Pat Weaver envisioned a person whose responsibilities would go beyond the bounds of traditional sit-down news anchors. The Communicator would interview, report, moderate dialogue and generally tie the show together into a coherent whole. Garroway and his successors have all followed that model, with little variation. Now, the hosts are expected to do much the same, and on any given day will talk with correspondents, newsmakers and lifestyle experts; introduce and close each half-hour, conduct special segments (such as cooking or fashion) and go on-assignment to host the program from different locations. Although the &quot;Communicator&quot; nomenclature has since dropped out of favor, the job remains largely the same.

====Anchors====
Including Savannah Guthrie and Craig Melvin, nine men and eight women have served as primary &quot;Today&quot; hosts since the program&#x27;s inception:

* Craig Melvin (January 13, 2025 – present)


Notes:
* Walters was hired as a &quot;Today&quot; writer and researcher in 1961, making her first appearance that August with a segment on the Paris fashion show. She was appointed as a &quot;&quot;Today&quot; Girl&quot; and reporter in October 1964; a &quot;Today&quot; panelist in September 1966, and became the program&#x27;s first female co-anchor upon Frank McGee&#x27;s death in April 1974.
* Pauley was hired as a &quot;Today&quot; panelist in 1976, and was promoted to co-anchor when Bryant Gumbel joined the program in 1982.
* Curry served as the show&#x27;s Anchor at Large from 2012 to 2015, after her time as a primary host.
*Guthrie first joined &quot;Today&quot; as co-host of the third hour, in 2012 she was promoted as co-anchor replacing Ann Curry.

====News anchors====
From the show&#x27;s inception, the idea of providing the latest news headlines has been critical to the function of the program. In that vein, there has always been at least one person on set whose job it is to prepare and deliver newscasts. In 1952, that person was called the &quot;news editor&quot; or (informally) &quot;news chief&quot;. In modern parlance, the term &quot;newsreader&quot; or &quot;news anchor&quot; is preferred. Under the two-hour format, four newscasts were delivered, once every half-hour. Presently, there are only two newscasts, delivered at the top of each of the first two hours. Some anchors, including Jim Fleming, Lew Wood, Floyd Kalber and John Palmer, were seasoned journalists before joining the program. Others, including Ann Curry, have used the position to increase their journalistic acumen, at times leaving the newsdesk behind to venture into the field. News anchors have included the following:

====Weather anchors====
For the program&#x27;s first 25 years, weather reports were delivered by the host or newsreader. Dave Garroway illustrated the day&#x27;s forecast by drawing fronts and areas of precipitation on a big chalkboard map of the United States, based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the National Weather Service in Washington, D.C. Subsequent hosts John Chancellor and Hugh Downs dropped the chalkboard weather map concept, and instead read a prepared weather summary over a still image of a weather map. When the show converted to all-color broadcasts in 1965, weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind Frank Blair, who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries. Following Blair&#x27;s retirement on March 14, 1975, Lew Wood took over the newsreader and weather reporting duties (using Blair&#x27;s format). When Floyd Kalber became newsreader in 1976, Wood was relegated to weather, sports, roving reporter assignments, and presenting live on-air commercials until his departure in 1978.

The weather is reported every half-hour during the program&#x27;s first two hours, though since Al Roker was named weather reporter on January 26, 1996, an interview is conducted by him in place of the national weather forecast at least once during the show, leaving only the local weather inserts by NBC stations.

Prior to Roker, &quot;Today&quot; weather reporters were Bob Ryan (1978–1980) and Willard Scott (1980–1996). Until Ryan&#x27;s hiring, no one on the show had practical experience or academic credentials in meteorology. With NBC&#x27;s purchase of The Weather Channel in 2008, personnel from that network frequently participate in &quot;Today&quot; forecast segments, at the site of a weather event or from the cable channel&#x27;s suburban Atlanta headquarters, or as a fill-in for Roker. This lasted until 2018 when TWC was acquired by Entertainment Studios.

NBC owned-and-operated stations and network affiliates are given a 30-second window to insert a local forecast segment into the program following the national weather report; Roker&#x27;s outcue for the local break is &quot;That&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on around the country, here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening in your neck of the woods,&quot; although in recent years, this outcue was used during only starting the second half-hour. During the first half hour, Roker simply uses &quot;your local forecast&quot; which appears after a 30-second commercial. Those not watching on an affiliate which provides local weather segments following the outcue (including international viewers, as well as NBC stations that do not have a news department) see a national summary of temperatures on a weather map.

The semi-retired Scott, who gained fame through his antics that included costumes and props, still appeared on-air to continue his tradition of wishing &quot;happy birthday&quot; to centenarians. Scott&#x27;s traditional local cue was &quot;Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening in your world, even as we speak.&quot; He retired completely from television on December 15, 2015.

====Regular panelists====

The job of &quot;panelist&quot; has no set definition. Panelist duties can range from conducting interviews to reporting on a number of topics in-studio and in the field. Regular panelists on the program include the following:
* Jack Lescoulie (1952–1967)
* Edwin Newman (1952–1984)
* Judith Crist (1964–1973)
* Barbara Walters (1966–1974, officially titled &quot;co-host&quot; in 1974)
* Joe Garagiola (1967–1973 and 1990–1992)
* Gene Shalit (1973–2010)

====&quot;Today&quot; Girls====
From 1952 to 1964, a notable member of the cast was a woman, often an entertainer, the &quot;Today&quot; Girl. Usually, she discussed fashion and lifestyle, reported the weather, covered lighter-fare stories or engaged in verbal jousting with Garroway. Estelle Parsons was the first to hold the job, though her title at the time was &quot;Women&#x27;s Editor&quot;. Upon her departure in 1955, the &quot;Today&quot; Girl name was adopted. The last to hold the position, Barbara Walters, discussed the job in her autobiography &quot;&quot;. She wrote that the &quot;Today&quot; Girl era pre-dated feminism, as it was believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting &quot;infotainment&quot; - Walters described the position as a &quot;tea pourer&quot;. In 1966, Walters was promoted to co-anchor alongside Hugh Downs, and the &quot;Today&quot; Girl position was eliminated. Those who held the position were:
====J. Fred Muggs====
From 1953 to 1957, the program featured J. Fred Muggs, a chimpanzee whose antics entertained viewers, but frustrated the program&#x27;s staff, especially Dave Garroway. Also occasionally appearing was J. Fred&#x27;s &quot;girlfriend&quot; Phoebe B. Beebe.

==Transitions==

===Pauley to Norville===
In 1989, Deborah Norville (then anchor of the network&#x27;s early-morning news program at the time, &quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot;) replaced John Palmer at the &quot;Today&quot; newsdesk, at which point he assumed her previous role on &quot;Sunrise&quot;. She also began substituting for Tom Brokaw on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. Shortly after Norville&#x27;s appointment as &quot;Today&quot;″s news anchor, the decision was made to feature her as an unofficial third host. Whereas Palmer had read the news from a desk separate from where Gumbel and Pauley sat, Norville was seated alongside the program&#x27;s hosts at the opening and closing of every show. Before long, gossip columns and media observers predicted that NBC would remove Jane Pauley from the program and replace her with Norville in an effort to improve the program&#x27;s recently declining viewership among young women, the demographic most coveted by morning shows. During this period, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featured a sketch titled &quot;All About Deborah Norville&quot; (a takeoff on the classic film &quot;All About Eve&quot;), which depicted Norville as ruthlessly scheming to take Pauley&#x27;s place as &quot;Today&quot; co-host.

In October 1989, it was announced that 13-year veteran Pauley would leave &quot;Today&quot; at the end of the year. NBC, as expected, announced that Norville would become co-host. An emotional Norville hugged Pauley on the air after the announcement was made, and many at the network hoped the negative press generated by Norville&#x27;s increased presence on the program would end. However, this turned out not to be the case. Prior to the announcement of Pauley&#x27;s departure, much of the criticism had focused on Norville&#x27;s youth and beauty, with many branding her &quot;the other woman&quot; and a &quot;home wrecker&quot;, in a reference to what some felt seemed like her intent on &quot;breaking up&quot; the television marriage of Gumbel and Pauley.

The negative press only heightened after the announcement of Pauley&#x27;s resignation, and Norville was put under a gag order by NBC brass, which prevented her from defending herself from the widespread and erroneous reports that she somehow orchestrated her rise on &quot;Today&quot;. In January 1990, the new anchor team of Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville, minus Jane Pauley, debuted with disastrous results. Nielsen ratings for the program began to plummet. Critics felt that Gumbel and Norville lacked chemistry and many loyal viewers began turning to rival ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; (&quot;GMA&quot;).

=== Norville to Couric ===
By the end of 1990, &quot;Today&quot;, the longtime dominant program, was officially the second-place morning show behind &quot;GMA,&quot; and most of the blame was pinned on Norville. By the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991, Norville saw her role as co-host continually minimized. &quot;Today&quot; aired special editions of the program called &quot;America at War&quot;, with Gumbel anchoring most of the show alone. It was not uncommon for Norville not even to appear until the two-hour show&#x27;s second half-hour. In addition, she was directed not to initiate conversation on the show and only speak when asked a question by Gumbel. Norville left the show for parental leave in February 1991. It was announced that Katie Couric would substitute co-host during Norville&#x27;s absence. Ratings for the program rose immediately following Norville&#x27;s departure and Couric&#x27;s arrival.

Midway though her maternity leave, Norville was interviewed by &quot;People&quot;. In the story, she avoided conversation about her recent trouble on &quot;Today&quot;, and instead focused on her newborn baby boy. She was photographed breastfeeding her son, a seemingly innocuous event, but NBC management was said to be greatly displeased by this, believing the photo to be &quot;in poor taste&quot;. By April 1991, in light of improved ratings on &quot;Today&quot; and NBC&#x27;s displeasure at the &quot;People&quot; photograph, it was announced that Norville would not return to &quot;Today&quot; and that Katie Couric had been named the program&#x27;s co-host. Norville, it was disclosed, would continue to be paid in accordance with her contract, although she would no longer appear on any NBC News programs.

===Couric to Vieira===
On April 5, 2006, Katie Couric announced on her 15th anniversary as co-host of &quot;Today&quot; that she would leave the program and NBC News at the end of May to become the new anchor and managing editor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. Couric&#x27;s final broadcast, on May 31, 2006, was dedicated to her 15 years as one of the show&#x27;s co-hosts, and celebrated her move to the anchor chair at CBS, where she also became a correspondent for the network&#x27;s Sunday night newsmagazine program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Couric said during the show, &quot;It&#x27;s been a pleasure hosting this program, and thank you for fifteen great years.&quot; A special video presentation was broadcast, recapping her best moments and news stories on &quot;Today&quot; during her 15 years with the show.

The day after Couric&#x27;s announcement, Meredith Vieira, then a host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot; announced on that show that she would take over as Lauer&#x27;s co-anchor in September. Lauer and Vieira began co-hosting together on September 13, 2006.

On June 1, 2006 (the day after Couric&#x27;s departure), NBC News announced that for the summer of 2006, &quot;Today&quot; would move to a temporary outdoor studio as Studio 1A was going through renovations to prepare for its switch to high-definition. On that same day, NBC News launched a new advertisement promoting Vieira&#x27;s arrival. That summer, Couric&#x27;s anchor seat was filled by various hosts, consisting of Curry, Morales and Campbell Brown (all of whom were considered candidates to replace Couric), until Vieira took over that fall.

In March 2010, Vieira signed a contract to keep her with the program until at least September 2011. However, she announced on May 9, 2011, that she would depart as co-host in the following month, but would remain at NBC News as a special correspondent.

===Vieira to Curry===
After announcing her resignation, Meredith Vieira departed the program on June 8, 2011. Vieira&#x27;s spot was filled by the program&#x27;s longtime news anchor Ann Curry, appearing alongside Matt Lauer as co-host. Correspondent Natalie Morales replaced Curry as news anchor in turn, with Al Roker remaining as the weather anchor. Savannah Guthrie joined Morales and Roker as co-host of the third (9:00 a.m.) hour.

Almost a year after her departure, Vieira returned briefly to &quot;Today&quot; as a special correspondent for events relating to Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Celebration. On June 5, 2012, she co-presented the show with Lauer from London.

===Curry to Guthrie===
NBC revealed on June 28, 2012, that Ann Curry would no longer co-host &quot;Today&quot;, and would continue to work for NBC News (where she remained until her departure in January 2015), including continuing to appear on &quot;Today&quot;. Curry&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Today Anchor at Large and NBC News National &amp; International Correspondent,&quot; with responsibilities including leading a seven-person unit producing content for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;, with occasional anchor duties for &quot;Nightly News&quot;. Curry also reported for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. On July 9, 2012, Savannah Guthrie succeeded Curry as co-anchor alongside Lauer, Roker and Morales.

Ann Curry&#x27;s final show as co-anchor was subdued compared to the earlier departures of Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira, as it did not include retrospectives of Curry&#x27;s 15-year run on the program or goodbye to messages from colleagues and celebrities, although Curry – seated alongside Lauer, Natalie Morales and Al Roker in the couch area of the Studio 1A set – gave a tear-filled farewell message to viewers. Rumors of Curry&#x27;s departure from &quot;Today&quot; began weeks before NBC formally announced that she would no longer be co-host, spurring negative press similar to that resulting from the departure of Jane Pauley and her replacement by Deborah Norville 23 years earlier, as early reports suggested that Matt Lauer had a hand in the program&#x27;s decision to let Curry go. Viewership declines for the program that began in the months following Curry becoming co-host precipitated in part due to public criticism over Lauer&#x27;s alleged involvement in Curry&#x27;s departure; loyal viewers once again began turning to the competing &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, which toppled &quot;Today&quot;″s 16-year consecutive run as the top-rated morning news program during the week of April 9, 2012. The public relations problems for Lauer that resulted from the accusations, led then-executive producer Jim Bell to admit responsibility for the negative press, in defense of Lauer, in a series of interviews with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and the Associated Press.

=== Lauer to Kotb ===
On November 29, 2017, Hoda Kotb became the interim co-anchor after Matt Lauer was terminated. Prior to that, she had been a third co-anchor of &quot;Today&quot;, sitting alongside Lauer and Guthrie at the beginning of the second half-hour. &quot;Today&quot; never formally made the announcement that Kotb would be joining earlier, instead Kotb came on earlier. She held that position on April 17, 2017, after her return from maternity leave until Lauer&#x27;s termination on November 29, 2017. On January 2, 2018, her interim status became permanent, making her and Savannah Guthrie the first all-female anchor duo in &quot;Today&#x27;s&quot; history and the second all-female anchor duo overall.

NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said in an email that Kotb has &quot;seamlessly stepped&quot; into the position, and with Guthrie, &quot;quickly hit the ground running&quot;. &quot;They have an undeniable connection with each other and most importantly, with viewers, a hallmark of Today,&quot; Lack added.

Just before the holidays, NBC executives offered the job to Kotb. She also continued to co-host the fourth hour of the show, a role she has held since 2007.

=== Kotb to Melvin ===
On September 26, 2024, Kotb announced her decision to step down as co-anchor of &quot;Today&quot; and co-host of the fourth hour in early 2025, but would remain at NBC in a role that was unspecified. Kotb had been co-hosting the fourth hour since 2007. In her announcement on the show, Kotb said she made her decision after turning 60 and stated, &quot;I realized that it was time for me to turn the page at 60 and to try something new.&quot; On November 14, 2024, Kotb&#x27;s final day was announced for January 10, 2025, with &quot;Today&quot; news anchor and &quot;3rd Hour Today&quot; co-host Craig Melvin succeeding Kotb as co-anchor of &quot;Today&quot; beginning January 13, 2025.

== Controversies ==

===Gumbel&#x27;s memo===
In 1989, Bryant Gumbel wrote a memo to the program&#x27;s then-executive producer Marty Ryan, which was critical of other &quot;Today&quot; personalities, and was leaked to the press. In the memo, Gumbel commented that Willard Scott &quot;holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste... This guy is killing us and no one&#x27;s even trying to rein him in.&quot; He commented that Gene Shalit&#x27;s movie reviews &quot;are often late and his interviews aren&#x27;t very good&quot;.

There was enough negative backlash in regard to Gumbel&#x27;s comments toward Scott that Gumbel was shown reconciling with Scott on &quot;Today&quot;.

===Selective editing of George Zimmerman 9-1-1 call===
After the killing of Trayvon Martin, &quot;Today&quot; ran a selectively edited version of the 9-1-1 call that George Zimmerman made prior to shooting and killing Martin (which he defended as being committed in self-defense while standing trial for the shooting, for which he was acquitted on charges of murder in July 2013), which had the effect of making Zimmerman appear racist. In a March 2012 edition of the program, &quot;Today&quot; played a recording of Zimmerman saying, &quot;This guy looks like he&#x27;s up to no good. He looks black.&quot; However, several seconds of the call were cut from the 911 tape, removing Zimmerman&#x27;s description of Martin, and a question asked to him about the teenager by the 911 operator. In the original, unedited tape, Zimmerman said, &quot;This guy looks like he&#x27;s up to no good. Or he&#x27;s on drugs or something. It&#x27;s raining and he&#x27;s just walking around, looking about.&quot; The operator then asked, &quot;OK, and this guy – is he black, white or Hispanic?&quot;, to which Zimmerman answered, &quot;He looks black.&quot;

In an opinion piece, Erik Wemple of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;Today&quot;″s alteration &quot;would more readily paint Zimmerman as a racial profiling. In reality&#x27;s version, Zimmerman simply answered a question about the race of the person whom he was reporting to the police. Nothing prejudicial at all in responding to such an inquiry... it&#x27;s a falsehood with repercussions. Much of the public discussion over the past week has settled on how conflicting facts and interpretations call into question whether Zimmerman acted justifiably or criminally... To portray that exchange in a way that wrongs Zimmerman is high editorial malpractice...&quot;

Following an internal investigation into the production of the segment, NBC News fired two employees who were involved in the piece, including a producer based at the division&#x27;s Miami bureau, in April 2012. In December 2012, George Zimmerman filed a defamation lawsuit against NBC for the editing of the 911 call. Florida Circuit Court Judge Debra Nelson dismissed the suit on June 30, 2014, citing that there were &quot;no genuine issues of material fact upon which a reasonable jury could find that the Defendants [NBCUniversal] acted with actual malice,&quot; but although Zimmerman could not prove that he was the victim of &quot;actual malice&quot;, stated that the malice standard was appropriate since Zimmerman is a public figure.

===9/11 Moment of Silence omission===
On September 11, 2012, &quot;Today&quot; sparked outrage after the program neglected to interrupt an interview with &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot; co-star Kris Jenner to broadcast the 11th anniversary remembrance ceremonies of the September 11 attacks at 8:46 a.m. Eastern. NBC was the only national television news outlet in the United States that did not interrupt regular programming to broadcast the moment of silence live. While the coverage of the ceremonies was not seen on the NBC network feed in most of the country, the network&#x27;s New York City flagship owned-and-operated station WNBC interrupted the &quot;Today&quot; broadcast to run locally produced special coverage of the entire ceremony.

=== Matt Lauer termination ===

On November 29, 2017, NBC terminated Lauer following allegations of &quot;inappropriate sexual behavior&quot;. NBC News chairman Andrew Lack announced Lauer&#x27;s termination, stating: &quot;It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company&#x27;s standards. As a result, we&#x27;ve decided to terminate his employment. While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he&#x27;s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident. Our highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected, and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender.&quot; Lauer would eventually be replaced by the long-time anchor of the show&#x27;s fourth hour, Hoda Kotb.

Although NBC did not publicly report or comment on the specifics of the allegations, the entertainment industry publication &quot;Variety&quot; ran a two-month long investigation involving interviews with Lauer&#x27;s former NBC colleagues on his behavior towards them, which included lurid accusations of making verbal and typed lewd comments, as well as making suggestive references to a colleague&#x27;s sexual performance.

=== Megyn Kelly blackface controversy ===
During the episode of October 23, 2018, Megyn Kelly participated in a panel discussion on the appropriateness of blackface in Halloween costume on her morning show &quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot;. During the segment, Kelly recollected that &quot;when I was a kid, that was okay as long as you were dressing up as like a character&quot;, and added that &quot;[Luann de Lesseps] wants to look like Diana Ross for one day, and I don&#x27;t know how that got racist on Halloween.&quot; Her comments were widely criticized for being interpreted as defense of the practice, which is generally considered to be a derogatory caricature of African-Americans. Critics likened Kelly&#x27;s remarks to a previous incident during her tenure at Fox News Channel, where Kelly asserted that Jesus and Santa Claus were white.

Later that day, Kelly issued an internal email apologizing for the remarks, stating that &quot;I realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong, and I am sorry&quot;, and that &quot;I&#x27;ve never been a &#x27;pc&#x27; kind of person — but I understand that we do need to be more sensitive in this day and age. Particularly on race and ethnicity issues which, far from being healed, have been exacerbated in our politics over the past year. This is a time for more understanding, love, sensitivity and honor, and I want to be part of that. I look forward to continuing that discussion.&quot;

Kelly opened the October 24 episode with a public apology, as well as a follow-up discussion with African-American commentators Amy Holmes and Roland Martin on why blackface is considered controversial. The same day, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Kelly had left the Creative Artists Agency, and had hired an attorney. It was also reported that, prior to the incident, Kelly and NBC had been discussing canceling the program so she could focus more on serving as a correspondent, but that the comments may have an impact on her future at the network. The week&#x27;s remaining episodes were replaced by encores.

On October 26, 2018, NBC News confirmed the cancellation of &quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot; and announced that the show&#x27;s existing anchors would temporarily fill the third hour.

==Expansion==
===Current===
====&quot;Weekend Today&quot;====

&quot;Today&quot; first expanded to weekends on September 20, 1987, with the debut of the Sunday edition. Five years later on August 1, 1992, the Saturday edition made its debut, expanding the program to seven days a week. The Sunday broadcast was originally 90 minutes in length, until the third half-hour being dropped with the expansion of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; to an hour-long broadcast in 1992; it now airs for one hour, while the Saturday broadcast airs for 90 minutes.

The weekend broadcasts continue the &quot;Today&quot; format of covering breaking news, interviews with newsmakers, reports on a variety of popular-culture and human-interest stories, covering health and finance issues, and national weather reports. NBC feeds the Saturday edition from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. (although it is often shortened to air the network&#x27;s kids&#x27; block in full when there is an early start to sports) and the Sunday edition from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. (both in the Eastern Time Zone), although many of the network&#x27;s affiliates air local newscasts in those time slots and carry the network broadcast earlier or later in the morning; many NBC affiliates also bookend the Sunday edition with local morning newscasts that immediately precede and follow the program. NBC&#x27;s New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles owned-and-operated stations air &quot;Weekend Today&quot; simultaneously (but not live) at 9:00 a.m Eastern, 8:00 a.m. Central and 6:00 a.m. Pacific Time.

Weekend editions are tailored to the priorities and interests of weekend viewers – offering special series such as &quot;&quot;Saturday Today&quot; on the Plaza&quot;, featuring live performances by major music acts and Broadway theatrical productions outside the studio throughout the summer.

During NBC Olympic broadcasts, the weekday anchors and staff present the majority of the program on both Saturday and Sunday throughout the two weeks to maintain promotional momentum, with limited contributions from the weekend team from New York.

====&quot;Early Today&quot;====

The first brand extension of &quot;Today&quot; was created in 1982. The early morning news program &quot;Early Today&quot; was conceived as a lead-in for &quot;Today&quot;, featuring the same anchors as the main program at the time, Bryant Gumbel and Jane Pauley. The half-hour program was fed twice to allow affiliates to carry one or both broadcasts. NBC canceled the program after a year, and replaced it with &quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot;, originally anchored by Connie Chung.

In April 1999, NBC canceled &quot;Sunrise&quot; for two brand extensions of &quot;Today&quot;. One was &quot;Early Today&quot; which was revived September 7, 1999; the revived program originally was produced by CNBC and focused on business and financial news before switching to general news under the same production staff as &quot;MSNBC First Look&quot; in 2004. &quot;Early Today&quot; continues to air on the network, airing live each weekday morning at 3:00 a.m. Eastern Time (with an updated telecast for viewers in the Pacific Time Zone), and on tape delay until 10:00 a.m. Eastern – corresponding with the start time of &quot;Today&quot; in the Pacific Time Zone – to allow for adjustment in airtimes for other time zones and for certain NBC stations without a local morning newscast to air &quot;Early Today&quot; in lieu of one.

==== &quot;Today 3rd Hour&quot; ====

Today 3rd Hour (often shortened to The 3rd), the current name for the third hour of &quot;Today&quot;, features anchors who appear in the first two hours of the program. After &quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot; was canceled on October 26, 2018, NBC announced that &quot;Today&quot; anchors would host the third hour. The new third hour premiered on October 29, 2018, with Hoda Kotb, Craig Melvin and Al Roker anchoring for the first 20 minutes from Studio 1A, reporting on the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, with Savannah Guthrie anchoring live from Pittsburgh. At the top of the program, Kotb said:
After 20 minutes, the program continued with Jenna Bush Hager from Studio 6A, the former home of &quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot;, where broadcasts of the third hour would begin to be based. Since its debut, the third hour has used a modified nameless opening title sequence compared to the other editions of &quot;Today&quot;. Various other &quot;Today&quot; and NBC News personalities filled in until January, when it was announced that the official hosts would be Al Roker, Sheinelle Jones, Dylan Dreyer and Craig Melvin, with the show becoming a primarily panel discussion program under the banner of &quot;The 3rd Hour&quot;. On December 4, 2018, an NBC News spokesperson confirmed that &quot;The 3rd&quot; would move to Studio 1A to streamline the production process and create a more seamless broadcast. The last day at Studio 6A was January 4, 2019, with new broadcasts in Studio 1A beginning on January 7.

====&quot;Today with Jenna &amp; Friends&quot;====

&quot;Today with Jenna &amp; Friends&quot; premiered on January 13, 2025, as the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot;, succeeding &quot;Hoda &amp; Jenna&quot;. The program is hosted by Jenna Bush Hager and guest hosts, and continues to follow a similar format as its predecessor as its own distinct entity.

==== &quot;Today&quot; All Day ====
On July 15, 2020, NBC launched &quot;Today&quot; All Day, a digital extension of &quot;Today&quot; which is a streaming video channel on the program&#x27;s website and Peacock. It features blocks of soft news and lifestyle segments drawn from the program, as well as original content hosted by the program&#x27;s personalities. NBC plans to eventually widen its distribution via third-party internet TV services in addition to its own.

===Former===
====&quot;Later Today&quot;====
On September 7, 1999, NBC launched Later Today, a talk show that was intended to air immediately following the then two-hour &quot;Today&quot;. Replacing &quot;Leeza&quot; (which would continue in first-run syndication for one more year) on the network&#x27;s morning schedule, &quot;Later Today&quot; was hosted by Jodi Applegate, Florence Henderson and Asha Blake. The program was canceled on August 11, 2000, due to lackluster ratings; it was replaced two months later by the third hour of &quot;Today&quot;, later known as &quot;Today&#x27;s Take&quot;.

====&quot;Today&#x27;s Take&quot;====
Today&#x27;s Take (sometimes called &quot;The Take&quot;) was the third-hour segment of &quot;Today&quot;. This &quot;show-within-a-show&quot; had its own anchors (although featuring on-air staff that appears during the first two hours of the program), opening title sequence and theme music.

On October 2, 2000, NBC expanded &quot;Today&quot; to three hours, with the addition of an hour from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. For its first twelve years, the format of the third hour was originally structured similarly to &quot;Today&quot;″s first two hours, using the same anchors as that portion of the broadcast; separate anchors began to be used for the third hour over time, with only the news anchor (Ann Curry until 2011, then Natalie Morales) and the weather anchor (Al Roker) being shared with the main 7:00 a.m. – 9:00 a.m. block – this was particularly the case during instances where Matt Lauer or his co-host (Katie Couric, then Meredith Vieira from 2006 to 2011, Ann Curry from 2011 to 2012, and finally Savannah Guthrie during the final months of the original format) could not be present for the entire hour due to reporting assignments or personal commitments. Vieira, outside of breaking news situations, was specifically disallowed by contract from any duties in the third hour due to her hosting commitments to the syndicated version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; by Disney–ABC Domestic Television.

The network revamped the format of the third hour on November 12, 2012, and gave it the in-program title &quot;Today&#x27;s Take&quot;. Roker was joined during the revamped third hour by Natalie Morales and Willie Geist (who had recently joined &quot;Today&quot; after ending his run as the original anchor of MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Way Too Early&quot;); MSNBC anchor and &quot;Today&quot; correspondent Tamron Hall was added as a co-host for that hour of the program on February 24, 2014, and Ellie Kemper joined the program on June 29, 2015, as a temporary co-host (until July 17, 2015).

With the change, traditional news segments at the beginning of the hour were abandoned in favor of a topical &quot;host chat&quot; format similar to the opening segment of the succeeding fourth hour of the program (with the only difference being that top general news events are discussed somewhat more often, in addition to featuring topical discussions on offbeat and pop culture-related stories and periodic clips from television programs aired the previous night and viral video). Instead, the news segment (titled &quot;News with Natalie&quot;, anchored by Morales, and alternately titled &quot;Today&#x27;s News&quot; on days when Morales was off) was featured prior to the local update cutaways near the end of the first half-hour; national weather segments are also retained following the host chat segments in both half-hours. Beginning in May 2015, the &quot;News with Natalie&quot;/&quot;Today&#x27;s News&quot; segment moved to 9:30 a.m. and the national weather segment to follow and the host chat at 9:30 a.m. was discontinued.

On August 22, 2016, both Morales and Geist left &quot;Today&#x27;s Take&quot; and former &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; host Billy Bush officially joined the set. Bush was later suspended and eventually fired from the segment as well as the program following Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape during U.S. Republican and presidential candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign in October 2016.

On February 1, 2017, Hall left &quot;Today&#x27;s Take&quot;. Weekend co-anchor Sheinelle Jones and weekend meteorologist Dylan Dreyer filled in as co-hosts alongside Roker until a new morning lineup began in the fall.

&quot;Today&#x27;s Take&quot; aired its final episode on September 22, 2017, and &quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot; replaced it on September 25, 2017.

====&quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot;====

&quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot; premiered on September 25, 2017, as a replacement for &quot;Today&#x27;s Take&quot;. It was hosted by former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, and was structured as a daytime talk show.

In the wake of stable but lower viewership in comparison to the timeslot&#x27;s predecessor, a desire by Kelly to focus more on her overall role at NBC News, and in the wake of controversy over a recent segment discussing blackface, the show was officially cancelled on October 26, 2018. Kelly never again appeared on NBC and departed the network three months later.

====&quot;Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda&quot;====
&quot;Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda&quot; was the fourth-hour segment of &quot;Today&quot; hosted by Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb, which aired from April 7, 2008, to April 5, 2019. It replaced the original fourth hour that debuted earlier that fall on September 10, 2007, originally hosted by Ann Curry, Natalie Morales, and Hoda Kotb. The program was its own distinct entity, with its own website and social media presence. The fourth hour does not have news or weather segments or input from the earlier hosts and is structured virtually as a standalone talk show, with an opening &quot;host chat&quot; segment reminiscent of the one popularized by Gifford and Regis Philbin on &quot;Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;, as well as interviews and features focusing on entertainment, fashion and other topics aimed at female viewers.

On December 11, 2018, NBC and Gifford announced that she would be retiring from her position of anchoring the fourth hour in April 2019, her 11th anniversary since joining &quot;Today&quot;. Kotb continues co-anchoring the fourth hour. On February 26, 2019, NBC announced that Jenna Bush Hager, the daughter of former U.S. President George W. Bush would replace Gifford.

====&quot;Today with Hoda &amp; Jenna&quot;====

&quot;Today with Hoda &amp; Jenna&quot; premiered on April 8, 2019, as the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot;, succeeding &quot;Kathie Lee &amp; Hoda&quot;. The program is hosted by Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager. On November 14, 2024, Kotb&#x27;s final day on Today was announced for January 10, 2025.

==Music==

&quot;Today&quot; host Dave Garroway selected Les Brown&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; as the program&#x27;s original theme music, which was used during Garroway&#x27;s entire run from 1952 to 1961. In 1962, when Hugh Downs became host, Django Reinhardt&#x27;s &quot;Melodie au Crepuscule&quot; was chosen as the new theme; it was replaced in 1963 by &quot;Misty&quot;, an instrumental ballad composed by Erroll Garner and performed by Bobby Hackett and John B. Seng.

&quot;Misty&quot; served as &quot;Today&quot;″s theme until 1971, when NBC News correspondent Frank McGee joined the show. Composer Ray Ellis penned an instrumental theme entitled &quot;This is &quot;Today&quot;&quot;, a jazzy, up-tempo piece that served as the program&#x27;s main theme until 1978. Because &quot;This is Today&quot; closely resembled Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s song &quot;Day by Day&quot; from the musical &quot;Godspell&quot;, Schwartz successfully sued for copyright infringement. &quot;This is &quot;Today&quot;&quot; was revised as a result, with the second version of the piece incorporating the familiar NBC chimes was used until 1981, at the close of the Tom Brokaw–Jane Pauley era. The chimes were also used throughout the program to introduce and conclude segments, usually in combination with the familiar &quot;Today&quot; sunburst logo.

By the time Bryant Gumbel was appointed co-anchor of the program in 1982, a new version of Ellis&#x27; &quot;This is &quot;Today&quot;&quot; theme was introduced, using a looser, more relaxed arrangement that continued to feature the NBC chimes in its melody. A shorter arrangement of &quot;This is &quot;Today&quot;&quot; was used for the show open (featuring a rotating globe and the &quot;Today&quot; sunburst) from 1983 to 1985. The main theme was used until 1985, and due to its popularity with viewers was resurrected as the show&#x27;s secondary theme in January 1993. The 1982 theme later served as the program&#x27;s official &quot;anniversary&quot; music, used to open and close retrospective segments in the leadup to &quot;Today&quot;&#x27;s 60th anniversary in 2012.

1985 saw the end of the synthesizer era at NBC as composer John Williams wrote a series of themes for all NBC News programs, with a cut entitled &quot;The Mission&quot;, serving as the principal theme for &quot;NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw&quot;. Williams also composed two themes for &quot;Today&quot;: an opening fanfare for the program that was derived from the opening of &quot;The Mission&quot;, and a two-minute closing theme for the show entitled &quot;Scherzo for Today&quot;, a dramatic arrangement that made heavy use of strings and flutes. In the late 1980s, &quot;Scherzo&quot; was played in its entirety multiple times daily during the weather scrolls that ran during local commercial breaks; however, most NBC affiliates preempted these segments with locally slotted advertising. The new &quot;Today&quot; themes – used in tandem with the show&#x27;s new opening sequence featuring the Statue of Liberty and a new living room studio set – gave the program a distinctly modern look and sound beginning in September 1985. A series of Williams-penned bumpers featuring &quot;The Mission&quot; signature were also used to open and close segments. &quot;Scherzo for Today&quot; was used as the program&#x27;s closing theme until 1990, and &quot;The Mission&quot; bumpers were used until 1993 (one of them could be heard as a station break lead-in on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet The Press&quot; until 2004).

Meanwhile, Williams&#x27; opening fanfare had opened the program ever since its 1985 introduction, with two brief interruptions; new opening themes were briefly introduced and quickly discarded in the summer of 1994 (to mark the debut of Studio 1A) and in 2004. The fanfare was iconically accompanied by Fred Facey announcing &quot;From NBC News, this is &quot;Today&quot;… with (anchor) and (anchor)&quot; (with &quot;Live from Studio 1A in Rockefeller Plaza&quot; being added to the introduction on June 20, 1994, when the show moved to its new studio). Although Facey died in April 2003, his introduction of the Couric–Lauer team was used for the duration of Couric&#x27;s era (except for special editions requiring special introductions). &quot;Weekend Today&quot; announcer Les Marshak became the new voice of the weekday program on September 13, 2006. A lighter theme employing the NBC chimes was used to open the show&#x27;s 7:30 a.m. through 9:30 a.m. half-hour segments, and was also used as a closing theme.

In March 2013, &quot;The Mission&quot; was replaced with a theme composed by Adam Gubman for Non-Stop Music. Along with Non-Stop Music, Gubman&#x27;s rebranding could be heard dating back to &quot;Today&quot;″s coverage of the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in April 2011. Gubman went on to write music for the network&#x27;s 2012 election coverage, and continues to provide audio content for &quot;Today&quot;.

==Ratings==
From 1995 to 2012, &quot;Today&quot; generally beat ABC rival &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in the Nielsen ratings among all network morning programs. By the week of September 11, 2006, the program earned 6.320 million total viewers, 1.6 million more than the 4.73 million viewers earned by &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. This gap eventually decreased, as by the week of June 30, 2008, &quot;Today&quot; was watched by an average of 4.9 million viewers, compared to &quot;Good Morning America&quot;″s 3.8 million.

Furthermore, by the week of October 12, 2008, &quot;Today&quot;″s total viewership had gone up to 4.910 million viewers, compared to second place &quot;Good Morning America&quot;″s total viewership of 4.25 million (and significantly above the 2.66 million viewers earned by CBS&#x27; &quot;The Early Show&quot;). For the week above, the third hour (referred as &quot;Today II&quot; by NBC exclusively for Nielsen ratings counts) drew 2.9 million viewers and the fourth hour (referred in Nielsen ratings as &quot;Today III&quot;), delivered 1.7 million.

For the week of January 4, 2009, the 8:00 a.m. hour of &quot;Today&quot; averaged 5.998 million viewers; the 9:00&amp; a.m. hour, meanwhile, averaged 4.447 million total viewers and a 1.4 rating among adults aged 25–54, marking that hour&#x27;s best ratings since the week of August 11, 2008. The 10:00 a.m. hour averaged 2.412 million total viewers and a .8 rating in the demographic, the highest total viewership for that portion of the program since the week of December 31, 2007.

For the week of April 11, 2011, the program passed its 800th consecutive week as the No. 1 rated network morning news program, with 5.662 million total viewers (ahead of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; by approximately 1.2 million viewers).

During the week of April 25, 2011, &quot;Today&quot; averaged 6.424 million viewers, marking its best weekly total viewership since August 11, 2008, during the 2008 Summer Olympics. This was largely buoyed by the April 29 coverage of the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, which earned 9.628 million viewers (beating &quot;Good Morning America&quot;″s coverage by more than 1.6 million viewers), and was also the best single day rating since November 8, 2000, the day after the 2000 presidential election.

<text>Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test or Pearson&#x27;s formula_1 test is a statistical test applied to sets of categorical data to evaluate how likely it is that any observed difference between the sets arose by chance. It is the most widely used of many chi-squared tests (e.g., Yates, likelihood ratio, portmanteau test in time series, etc.) – statistical procedures whose results are evaluated by reference to the chi-squared distribution. Its properties were first investigated by Karl Pearson in 1900. In contexts where it is important to improve a distinction between the test statistic and its distribution, names similar to &quot;Pearson χ-squared&quot; test or statistic are used.

It is a p-value test. The setup is as follows:

* Before the experiment, the experimenter fixes a certain number formula_2 of samples to take.
* The observed data is formula_3, the count number of samples from a finite set of given categories. They satisfy formula_4.
* The null hypothesis is that the count numbers are sampled from a multinomial distribution formula_5. That is, the underlying data is sampled IID from a categorical distribution formula_6 over the given categories.
* The Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test statistic is defined as formula_7. The p-value of the test statistic is computed either numerically or by looking it up in a table.
* If the p-value is small enough (usually p &lt; 0.05 by convention), then the null hypothesis is rejected, and we conclude that the observed data does not follow the multinomial distribution.

A simple example is testing the hypothesis that an ordinary six-sided die is &quot;fair&quot; (i. e., all six outcomes are equally likely to occur). In this case, the observed data is formula_8, the number of times that the dice has fallen on each number. The null hypothesis is formula_9, and formula_10. As detailed below, if formula_11, then the fairness of dice can be rejected at the level of formula_12.

==Usage==
Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test is used to assess three types of comparison: goodness of fit, homogeneity, and independence.
* A test of goodness of fit establishes whether an observed frequency distribution differs from a theoretical distribution.
* A test of homogeneity compares the distribution of counts for two or more groups using the same categorical variable (e.g. choice of activity—college, military, employment, travel—of graduates of a high school reported a year after graduation, sorted by graduation year, to see if number of graduates choosing a given activity has changed from class to class, or from decade to decade).
* A test of independence assesses whether observations consisting of measures on two variables, expressed in a contingency table, are independent of each other (e.g. polling responses from people of different nationalities to see if one&#x27;s nationality is related to the response).

For all three tests, the computational procedure includes the following steps:
# Calculate the chi-squared test statistic, formula_1, which resembles a normalized sum of squared deviations between observed and theoretical frequencies (see below).
# Determine the degrees of freedom, df, of that statistic.
## For a test of goodness-of-fit, , where &quot;Cats&quot; is the number of observation categories recognized by the model, and &quot;Params&quot; is the number of parameters in the model adjusted to make the model best fit the observations: The number of categories reduced by the number of fitted parameters in the distribution.
## For a test of homogeneity, , where &quot;Rows&quot; corresponds to the number of categories (i.e. rows in the associated contingency table), and &quot;Cols&quot; corresponds to the number of independent groups (i.e. columns in the associated contingency table).
## For a test of independence, , where in this case, &quot;Rows&quot; corresponds to the number of categories in one variable, and &quot;Cols&quot; corresponds to the number of categories in the second variable.
# Select a desired level of confidence (significance level, &quot;p&quot;-value, or the corresponding alpha level) for the result of the test.
# Compare formula_1 to the critical value from the chi-squared distribution with &quot;df&quot; degrees of freedom and the selected confidence level (one-sided, since the test is only in one direction, i.e. is the test value greater than the critical value?), which in many cases gives a good approximation of the distribution of formula_1.
# Sustain or reject the null hypothesis that the observed frequency distribution is the same as the theoretical distribution based on whether the test statistic exceeds the critical value of formula_1. If the test statistic exceeds the critical value of formula_1, the null hypothesis (formula_18 = there is &quot;no&quot; difference between the distributions) can be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis (formula_19 = there &quot;is&quot; a difference between the distributions) can be accepted, both with the selected level of confidence. If the test statistic falls below the threshold formula_1 value, then no clear conclusion can be reached, and the null hypothesis is sustained (we fail to reject the null hypothesis), though not necessarily accepted.

==Test for fit of a distribution==

===Discrete uniform distribution===

In this case formula_2 observations are divided among formula_22 cells. A simple application is to test the hypothesis that, in the general population, values would occur in each cell with equal frequency. The &quot;theoretical frequency&quot; for any cell (under the null hypothesis of a discrete uniform distribution) is thus calculated as
formula_23
and the reduction in the degrees of freedom is formula_24, notionally because the observed frequencies formula_25 are constrained to sum to formula_2.

One specific example of its application would be its application for log-rank test.

===Other distributions===

When testing whether observations are random variables whose distribution belongs to a given family of distributions, the &quot;theoretical frequencies&quot; are calculated using a distribution from that family fitted in some standard way. The reduction in the degrees of freedom is calculated as formula_27, where formula_28 is the number of parameters used in fitting the distribution. For instance, when checking a three-parameter Generalized gamma distribution, formula_29, and when checking a normal distribution (where the parameters are mean and standard deviation), formula_30, and when checking a Poisson distribution (where the parameter is the expected value), formula_31. Thus, there will be formula_32 degrees of freedom, where formula_22 is the number of categories.

The degrees of freedom are not based on the number of observations as with a Student&#x27;s t or F-distribution. For example, if testing for a fair, six-sided die, there would be five degrees of freedom because there are six categories or parameters (each number); the number of times the die is rolled does not influence the number of degrees of freedom.

===Calculating the test-statistic===
The value of the test-statistic is

formula_34

where
*formula_35 = Pearson&#x27;s cumulative test statistic, which asymptotically approaches a formula_1 distribution.
*formula_25 = the number of observations of type &quot;i&quot;.
*formula_2 = total number of observations
*formula_39 = the expected (theoretical) count of type &quot;i&quot;, asserted by the null hypothesis that the fraction of type &quot;i&quot; in the population is formula_40
*formula_22 = the number of cells in the table.

The chi-squared statistic can then be used to calculate a p-value by comparing the value of the statistic to a chi-squared distribution. The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of cells formula_22, minus the reduction in degrees of freedom, formula_43.

The chi-squared statistic can be also calculated as

formula_44

This result is the consequence of the Binomial theorem.

The result about the numbers of degrees of freedom is valid when the original data are multinomial and hence the estimated parameters are efficient for minimizing the chi-squared statistic. More generally however, when maximum likelihood estimation does not coincide with minimum chi-squared estimation, the distribution will lie somewhere between a chi-squared distribution with formula_45 and formula_46 degrees of freedom (See for instance Chernoff and Lehmann, 1954).

The chi-squared test indicates a statistically significant association between the level of education completed and routine check-up attendance (chi2(3) = 14.6090, p = 0.002). The proportions suggest that as the level of education increases, so does the proportion of individuals attending routine check-ups. Specifically, individuals who have graduated from college or university attend routine check-ups at a higher proportion (31.52%) compared to those who have not graduated high school (8.44%). This finding may suggest that higher educational attainment is associated with a greater likelihood of engaging in health-promoting behaviors such as routine check-ups.

===Bayesian method===
In Bayesian statistics, one would instead use a Dirichlet distribution as conjugate prior. If one took a uniform prior, then the maximum likelihood estimate for the population probability is the observed probability, and one may compute a credible region around this or another estimate.

==Testing for statistical independence==
In this case, an &quot;observation&quot; consists of the values of two outcomes and the null hypothesis is that the occurrence of these outcomes is statistically independent. Each observation is allocated to one cell of a two-dimensional array of cells (called a contingency table) according to the values of the two outcomes. If there are &quot;r&quot; rows and &quot;c&quot; columns in the table, the &quot;theoretical frequency&quot; for a cell, given the hypothesis of independence, is

formula_47

where formula_2 is the total sample size (the sum of all cells in the table), and

formula_49

is the fraction of observations of type &quot;i&quot; ignoring the column attribute (fraction of row totals), and
formula_50

is the fraction of observations of type &quot;j&quot; ignoring the row attribute (fraction of column totals). The term &quot;frequencies&quot; refers to absolute numbers rather than already normalized values.

The value of the test-statistic is

formula_51
formula_52

Note that formula_53 is 0 if and only if formula_54, i.e. only if the expected and true number of observations are equal in all cells.

Fitting the model of &quot;independence&quot; reduces the number of degrees of freedom by &quot;p&quot; = &quot;r&quot; + &quot;c&quot; − 1. The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of cells &quot;rc&quot;, minus the reduction in degrees of freedom, &quot;p&quot;, which reduces to (&quot;r&quot; − 1)(&quot;c&quot; − 1).

For the test of independence, also known as the test of homogeneity, a chi-squared probability of less than or equal to 0.05 (or the chi-squared statistic being at or larger than the 0.05 critical point) is commonly interpreted by applied workers as justification for rejecting the null hypothesis that the row variable is independent of the column variable.
The alternative hypothesis corresponds to the variables having an association or relationship where the structure of this relationship is not specified.

==Assumptions==
The chi-squared test, when used with the standard approximation that a chi-squared distribution is applicable, has the following assumptions:

; Simple random sample: The sample data is a random sampling from a fixed distribution or population where every collection of members of the population of the given sample size has an equal probability of selection. Variants of the test have been developed for complex samples, such as where the data is weighted. Other forms can be used such as purposive sampling.
; Sample size (whole table): A sample with a sufficiently large size is assumed. If a chi squared test is conducted on a sample with a smaller size, then the chi squared test will yield an inaccurate inference. The researcher, by using chi squared test on small samples, might end up committing a Type II error. For small sample sizes the Cash test is preferred.
; Expected cell count: Adequate expected cell counts. Some require 5 or more, and others require 10 or more. A common rule is 5 or more in all cells of a 2-by-2 table, and 5 or more in 80% of cells in larger tables, but no cells with zero expected count. When this assumption is not met, Yates&#x27;s correction is applied.
; Independence: The observations are always assumed to be independent of each other. This means chi-squared cannot be used to test correlated data (like matched pairs or panel data). In those cases, McNemar&#x27;s test may be more appropriate.

A test that relies on different assumptions is Fisher&#x27;s exact test; if its assumption of fixed marginal distributions is met it is substantially more accurate in obtaining a significance level, especially with few observations. In the vast majority of applications this assumption will not be met, and Fisher&#x27;s exact test will be over conservative and not have correct coverage.

==Derivation==
The null distribution of the Pearson statistic with &quot;j&quot; rows and &quot;k&quot; columns is approximated by the chi-squared distribution with
(&quot;k&quot; − 1)(&quot;j&quot; − 1) degrees of freedom.

This approximation arises as the true distribution, under the null hypothesis, if the expected value is given by a multinomial distribution. For large sample sizes, the central limit theorem says this distribution tends toward a certain multivariate normal distribution.

===Two cells===
In the special case where there are only two cells in the table, the expected values follow a binomial distribution,

formula_55

where

*&quot;p&quot; = probability, under the null hypothesis,
*&quot;n&quot; = number of observations in the sample.

In the above example the hypothesised probability of a male observation is 0.5, with 100 samples. Thus we expect to observe 50 males.

If &quot;n&quot; is sufficiently large, the above binomial distribution may be approximated by a Gaussian (normal) distribution and thus the Pearson test statistic approximates a chi-squared distribution,

formula_56

Let &quot;O&quot;1 be the number of observations from the sample that are in the first cell. The Pearson test statistic can be expressed as

formula_57

which can in turn be expressed as

formula_58

By the normal approximation to a binomial this is the squared of one standard normal variate, and hence is distributed as chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom. Note that the denominator is one standard deviation of the Gaussian approximation, so can be written

formula_59

So as consistent with the meaning of the chi-squared distribution, we are measuring how probable the observed number of standard deviations away from the mean is under the Gaussian approximation (which is a good approximation for large &quot;n&quot;).

The chi-squared distribution is then integrated on the right of the statistic value to obtain the P-value, which is equal to the probability of getting a statistic equal or bigger than the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis.

===Two-by-two contingency tables===
When the test is applied to a contingency table containing two rows and two columns, the test is equivalent to a Z-test of proportions.

===Many cells===
Broadly similar arguments as above lead to the desired result, though the details are more involved. One may apply an orthogonal change of variables to turn the limiting summands in the test statistic into one fewer squares of i.i.d. standard normal random variables.

Let us now prove that the distribution indeed approaches asymptotically the formula_1 distribution as the number of observations approaches infinity.

Let formula_22 be the number of observations, formula_62 the number of cells and formula_63 the probability of an observation to fall in the i-th cell, for formula_64. We denote by formula_65 the configuration where for each i there are formula_66 observations in the i-th cell. Note that

formula_67

Let formula_68 be Pearson&#x27;s cumulative test statistic for such a configuration, and let formula_69 be the distribution of this statistic. We will show that the latter probability approaches the formula_1 distribution with formula_71 degrees of freedom, as formula_72

For any arbitrary value T:

formula_73

We will use a procedure similar to the approximation in de Moivre–Laplace theorem. Contributions from small formula_66 are of subleading order in formula_22 and thus for large formula_22 we may use Stirling&#x27;s formula for both formula_77 and formula_78 to get the following:

formula_79

By substituting for

formula_80

we may approximate for large formula_22 the sum over the formula_66 by an integral over the formula_83. Noting that:

formula_84

we arrive at

formula_85

By expanding the logarithm and taking the leading terms in formula_22, we get

formula_87

Pearson&#x27;s chi, formula_88, is precisely the argument of the exponent (except for the −1/2; note that the final term in the exponent&#x27;s argument is equal to formula_89).

This argument can be written as:

formula_90

formula_91 is a regular symmetric formula_92 matrix, and hence diagonalizable. It is therefore possible to make a linear change of variables in formula_93 so as to get formula_71 new variables formula_95 so that:

formula_96

This linear change of variables merely multiplies the integral by a constant Jacobian, so we get:

formula_97

Where C is a constant.

This is the probability that squared sum of formula_71 independent normally distributed variables of zero mean and unit variance will be greater than T, namely that formula_1 with formula_71 degrees of freedom is larger than T.

We have thus shown that at the limit where formula_101 the distribution of Pearson&#x27;s chi approaches the chi distribution with formula_71 degrees of freedom.
An alternative derivation is on the multinomial distribution page.

==Examples==

===Fairness of dice===
A 6-sided die is thrown 60 times. The number of times it lands with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 face up is 5, 8, 9, 8, 10 and 20, respectively. Is the die biased, according to the Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test at a significance level of 95% and/or 99%?

The null hypothesis is that the die is unbiased, hence each number is expected to occur the same number of times, in this case, = 10. The outcomes can be tabulated as follows:
We then consult an &quot;Upper-tail critical values of chi-square distribution&quot; table, the tabular value refers to the sum of the squared variables each divided by the expected outcomes. For the present example, this means

formula_103

This is the experimental result whose unlikeliness (with a fair die) we wish to estimate. 
The experimental sum of 13.4 is between the critical values of 97.5% and 99% significance or confidence (p-value). Specifically, getting 20 rolls of 6, when the expectation is only 10 such values, is unlikely with a fair die.

===Chi-squared goodness of fit test===
In this context, the frequencies of both theoretical and empirical distributions are unnormalised counts, and for a chi-squared test the total sample sizes formula_2 of both these distributions (sums of all cells of the corresponding contingency tables) have to be the same.

For example, to test the hypothesis that a random sample of 100 people has been drawn from a population in which men and women are equal in frequency, the observed number of men and women would be compared to the theoretical frequencies of 50 men and 50 women. If there were 44 men in the sample and 56 women, then

formula_105

If the null hypothesis is true (i.e., men and women are chosen with equal probability), the test statistic will be drawn from a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom (because if the male frequency is known, then the female frequency is determined).

Consultation of the chi-squared distribution for 1 degree of freedom shows that the probability of observing this difference (or a more extreme difference than this) if men and women are equally numerous in the population is approximately 0.23. This probability is higher than conventional criteria for statistical significance (0.01 or 0.05), so normally we would not reject the null hypothesis that the number of men in the population is the same as the number of women (i.e., we would consider our sample within the range of what we would expect for a 50/50 male–female ratio.)

==Problems==
The approximation to the chi-squared distribution breaks down if expected frequencies are too low. It will normally be acceptable so long as no more than 20% of the events have expected frequencies below 5. Where there is only 1 degree of freedom, the approximation is not reliable if expected frequencies are below 10. In this case, a better approximation can be obtained by reducing the absolute value of each difference between observed and expected frequencies by 0.5 before squaring; this is called Yates&#x27;s correction for continuity.

In cases where the expected value, E, is found to be small (indicating a small underlying population probability, and/or a small number of observations), the normal approximation of the multinomial distribution can fail, and in such cases it is found to be more appropriate to use the G-test, a likelihood ratio-based test statistic. When the total sample size is small, it is necessary to use an appropriate exact test, typically either the binomial test or, for contingency tables, Fisher&#x27;s exact test. This test uses the conditional distribution of the test statistic given the marginal totals, and thus assumes that the margins were determined before the study; alternatives such as Boschloo&#x27;s test which do not make this assumption are uniformly more powerful.

It can be shown that the formula_1 test is a low order approximation of the formula_107 test. The above reasons for the above issues become apparent when the higher order terms are investigated.

<text>Pontic is a proposed language family or macrofamily, comprising the Indo-European and Northwest Caucasian language families, with Proto-Pontic being its reconstructed proto-language.

==History of the proposal==
The internal reconstruction of the Indo-European proto-language done by Émile Benveniste and Winfred P. Lehmann has set Proto-Indo-European (PIE) typologically quite apart from its daughters. In 1960, Aert Kuipers noticed the parallels between a Northwest Caucasian language, Kabardian, and PIE. It was Paul Friedrich in 1964, however, who first suggested that PIE might be phylogenetically related to Proto-Caucasian.

In 1981, John Colarusso examined typological parallels involving consonantism, focusing on the so-called laryngeals of PIE and in 1989, he published his reconstruction of Proto-Northwest Caucasian (PNWC). Eight years later, the first results of his comparative work on PNWC and PIE were published in his article &quot;Proto-Pontic: Phyletic Links Between Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Northwest Caucasian&quot;, an event which may be considered the actual beginning of the hypothesis.

==Evidence==

Examples of similarities that have been noted include:

* Nasal negating particles in both families:
** PIE : Germanic , Romance , Slavic .
** NWC: Ubykh , Abkhaz .
* A case variously named &quot;accusative&quot;, &quot;oblique&quot; or &quot;objective&quot;, marked with nasal suffixes:
** PIE accusative , reflected e.g. in Latin &#x27;moon&#x27; (nom.) vs (acc.), or Ancient Greek (, nom.) vs. (, acc.).
** NWC: Ubykh &#x27;well (water source)&#x27; (abs.) vs (obl.).

<text>A chi-squared test (also chi-square or test) is a statistical hypothesis test used in the analysis of contingency tables when the sample sizes are large. In simpler terms, this test is primarily used to examine whether two categorical variables (&quot;two dimensions of the contingency table&quot;) are independent in influencing the test statistic (&quot;values within the table&quot;). The test is valid when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis, specifically Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test and variants thereof. Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table. For contingency tables with smaller sample sizes, a Fisher&#x27;s exact test is used instead.

In the standard applications of this test, the observations are classified into mutually exclusive classes. If the null hypothesis that there are no differences between the classes in the population is true, the test statistic computed from the observations follows a frequency distribution. The purpose of the test is to evaluate how likely the observed frequencies would be assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Test statistics that follow a distribution occur when the observations are independent. There are also tests for testing the null hypothesis of independence of a pair of random variables based on observations of the pairs.

&quot;Chi-squared tests&quot; often refers to tests for which the distribution of the test statistic approaches the distribution asymptotically, meaning that the sampling distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) of the test statistic approximates a chi-squared distribution more and more closely as sample sizes increase.

== History ==
In the 19th century, statistical analytical methods were mainly applied in biological data analysis and it was customary for researchers to assume that observations followed a normal distribution, such as Sir George Airy and Mansfield Merriman, whose works were criticized by Karl Pearson in his 1900 paper.

At the end of the 19th century, Pearson noticed the existence of significant skewness within some biological observations. In order to model the observations regardless of being normal or skewed, Pearson, in a series of articles published from 1893 to 1916, devised the Pearson distribution, a family of continuous probability distributions, which includes the normal distribution and many skewed distributions, and proposed a method of statistical analysis consisting of using the Pearson distribution to model the observation and performing a test of goodness of fit to determine how well the model really fits to the observations.

=== Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test ===
In 1900, Pearson published a paper on the test which is considered to be one of the foundations of modern statistics. In this paper, Pearson investigated a test of goodness of fit.

Suppose that observations in a random sample from a population are classified into mutually exclusive classes with respective observed numbers of observations (for ), and a null hypothesis gives the probability that an observation falls into the th class. So we have the expected numbers for all , where

:formula_1

Pearson proposed that, under the circumstance of the null hypothesis being correct, as the limiting distribution of the quantity given below is the distribution.

:formula_2

Pearson dealt first with the case in which the expected numbers are large enough known numbers in all cells assuming every observation may be taken as normally distributed, and reached the result that, in the limit as becomes large, follows the distribution with degrees of freedom.

However, Pearson next considered the case in which the expected numbers depended on the parameters that had to be estimated from the sample, and suggested that, with the notation of being the true expected numbers and being the estimated expected numbers, the difference

:formula_3

will usually be positive and small enough to be omitted. In a conclusion, Pearson argued that if we regarded as also distributed as distribution with degrees of freedom, the error in this approximation would not affect practical decisions. This conclusion caused some controversy in practical applications and was not settled for 20 years until Fisher&#x27;s 1922 and 1924 papers.

== Other examples of chi-squared tests ==

One test statistic that follows a chi-squared distribution exactly is the test that the variance of a normally distributed population has a given value based on a sample variance. Such tests are uncommon in practice because the true variance of the population is usually unknown. However, there are several statistical tests where the chi-squared distribution is approximately valid:

=== Fisher&#x27;s exact test ===
For an exact test used in place of the 2 × 2 chi-squared test for independence when all the row and column totals were fixed by design, see Fisher&#x27;s exact test. When the row or column margins (or both) are random variables (as in most common research designs) this tends to be overly conservative and underpowered.

=== Binomial test ===
For an exact test used in place of the 2 × 1 chi-squared test for goodness of fit, see binomial test.

=== Other chi-squared tests ===
* Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel chi-squared test.
* McNemar&#x27;s test, used in certain tables with pairing
* Tukey&#x27;s test of additivity
* The portmanteau test in time-series analysis, testing for the presence of autocorrelation
* Likelihood-ratio tests in general statistical modelling, for testing whether there is evidence of the need to move from a simple model to a more complicated one (where the simple model is nested within the complicated one).

== Yates&#x27;s correction for continuity ==

Using the chi-squared distribution to interpret Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared statistic requires one to assume that the discrete probability of observed binomial frequencies in the table can be approximated by the continuous chi-squared distribution. This assumption is not quite correct and introduces some error.

To reduce the error in approximation, Frank Yates suggested a correction for continuity that adjusts the formula for Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test by subtracting 0.5 from the absolute difference between each observed value and its expected value in a contingency table. This reduces the chi-squared value obtained and thus increases its &quot;p&quot;-value.

==Chi-squared test for variance in a normal population==
If a sample of size is taken from a population having a normal distribution, then there is a result (see distribution of the sample variance) which allows a test to be made of whether the variance of the population has a pre-determined value. For example, a manufacturing process might have been in stable condition for a long period, allowing a value for the variance to be determined essentially without error. Suppose that a variant of the process is being tested, giving rise to a small sample of product items whose variation is to be tested. The test statistic in this instance could be set to be the sum of squares about the sample mean, divided by the nominal value for the variance (i.e. the value to be tested as holding). Then has a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom. For example, if the sample size is 21, the acceptance region for with a significance level of 5% is between 9.59 and 34.17.
==Example chi-squared test for categorical data==

Suppose there is a city of 1,000,000 residents with four neighborhoods: , , , and . A random sample of 650 residents of the city is taken and their occupation is recorded as &quot;white collar&quot;, &quot;blue collar&quot;, or &quot;no collar&quot;. The null hypothesis is that each person&#x27;s neighborhood of residence is independent of the person&#x27;s occupational classification. The data are tabulated as:

Let us take the sample living in neighborhood , 150, to estimate what proportion of the whole 1,000,000 live in neighborhood . Similarly we take to estimate what proportion of the 1,000,000 are white-collar workers. By the assumption of independence under the hypothesis we should &quot;expect&quot; the number of white-collar workers in neighborhood to be

: formula_4

Then in that &quot;cell&quot; of the table, we have

: formula_5

The sum of these quantities over all of the cells is the test statistic; in this case, formula_6. Under the null hypothesis, this sum has approximately a chi-squared distribution whose number of degrees of freedom is

: formula_7

If the test statistic is improbably large according to that chi-squared distribution, then one rejects the null hypothesis of independence.

A related issue is a test of homogeneity. Suppose that instead of giving every resident of each of the four neighborhoods an equal chance of inclusion in the sample, we decide in advance how many residents of each neighborhood to include. Then each resident has the same chance of being chosen as do all residents of the same neighborhood, but residents of different neighborhoods would have different probabilities of being chosen if the four sample sizes are not proportional to the populations of the four neighborhoods. In such a case, we would be testing &quot;homogeneity&quot; rather than &quot;independence&quot;. The question is whether the proportions of blue-collar, white-collar, and no-collar workers in the four neighborhoods are the same. However, the test is done in the same way.

==Applications==

In cryptanalysis, the chi-squared test is used to compare the distribution of plaintext and (possibly) decrypted ciphertext. The lowest value of the test means that the decryption was successful with high probability. This method can be generalized for solving modern cryptographic problems.

In bioinformatics, the chi-squared test is used to compare the distribution of certain properties of genes (e.g., genomic content, mutation rate, interaction network clustering, etc.) belonging to different categories (e.g., disease genes, essential genes, genes on a certain chromosome etc.).

<doc id="226682" wikidata="Q1126637" url="?curid=226682" title="Casualties of War">
<text>Casualties of War is a 1989 American war drama film directed by Brian De Palma and written by David Rabe, based primarily on an article written by Daniel Lang for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1969, which was later published as a book. The film stars Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn and is based on the events of the 1966 incident on Hill 192 during the Vietnam War, in which a Vietnamese woman was kidnapped from her village, raped, and murdered by a squad of American soldiers. All names and some details of the true story were altered for the film.

==Plot==
The story is presented as a flashback of Max Eriksson, a Vietnam veteran.

Lieutenant Reilly leads his platoon of American soldiers on a nighttime patrol. They are attacked by the Viet Cong (VC) after a panicked soldier exposes their position. While guarding the platoon&#x27;s flank, Eriksson falls as the top of a VC tunnel gives way beneath him. Eriksson&#x27;s squad leader, Sergeant Tony Meserve, pulls Eriksson out of the hole and eventually, the platoon retreats out of the jungle.

The platoon takes a break outside a river village in the Central Highlands. While relaxing and joking around, one of Meserve&#x27;s friends, Specialist 4 &quot;Brownie&quot; Brown, is killed when the Viet Cong ambushes them. Brownie&#x27;s death has a major impact on Meserve. The platoon is sent back to their base. Private First Class Antonio Dìaz arrives as the replacement radio operator.

Frustrated because his squad has been denied leave for an extended period, Meserve orders the squad to kidnap a Vietnamese girl. Eriksson strenuously objects, but Meserve, Corporal Thomas E. Clark, and Private First Class Herbert Hatcher ignore him. Before the quintet disembarks, Eriksson voices his concerns to his closest friend, Rowan. At nightfall, the squad enters a village and kidnaps a Vietnamese girl, Tran Thi Oanh.

As the squad treks through the mountains, Dìaz begins to reconsider kidnapping Tran and begs Eriksson to back him up. The squad and Tran eventually take refuge in an abandoned hooch, where Eriksson is confronted and threatened by Meserve, Clark, and Hatcher. Dìaz suddenly gives in to the pressure, leaving Eriksson alone in opposing the kidnapping and planned sexual assault. Meserve forces Eriksson to stand guard outside while the other men take turns raping Tran.

At daybreak, Eriksson is ordered to guard Tran while the rest of the squad takes up a position near a railroad bridge overlooking a Viet Cong river supply depot. Through his acts of kindness, Eriksson manages to earn Tran&#x27;s trust and prepares to go AWOL and return Tran to her family. However, Meserve sends Clark to get Eriksson and Tran to go to the bridge before Eriksson can carry out his plan.

Meserve has Dìaz order close air support for an assault on the depot and then orders Dìaz to kill Tran with a knife. Before Dìaz can kill her, Eriksson fires his rifle into the air, exposing them to the nearby Viet Cong. Amidst the firefight, Tran tries to escape, despite being repeatedly stabbed by Clark. Eriksson tries to save her, but Meserve stops him and knocks him down with the butt of his gun. Eriksson watches helplessly as the entire squad shoots Tran numerous times until she falls off the bridge to her death.

After the battle, Eriksson wakes up in a field hospital at the base. He eventually bumps into Rowan and tells him everything that happened. Rowan suggests that Eriksson see Reilly and company commander Captain Hill. Reilly and Hill both prefer to bury the matter but Hill, infuriated at Eriksson&#x27;s determination to press the issue, resolves to get rid of Eriksson and orders him transferred to a tunnel rat unit. The other men in Meserve&#x27;s squad will all be reassigned as well.

After narrowly escaping an attempt to kill him in the latrine with a grenade (made by Clark), Eriksson storms into a tent and smacks Clark in the face with a shovel, reminding Meserve that killing him is unnecessary because no one cares about what they did. Meserve shakily derides Eriksson, saying he is crazy, and Eriksson leaves.

Eriksson then meets an Army chaplain at a bar and describes what happened during the patrol. The chaplain in turn reports it, launching an investigation. The four men who participated in the rape and murder are court-martialed: Meserve receives ten years&#x27; hard labor and a dishonorable discharge, Clark receives life in prison, and Hatcher and Diaz receive fifteen and eight years of hard labor, respectively.

At the end of the film, Eriksson wakens from a nightmare to find himself on a J-Church transit line in San Francisco, just a few seats from a Vietnamese-American student who resembles Tran. She disembarks at Dolores Park and forgets her scarf, prompting Eriksson to run after her to return it. As she thanks him and turns away, he calls after her in Vietnamese. She surmises that she reminds him of someone and that he has had a bad dream, but assures him that &quot;it&#x27;s over now.&quot; They go their separate ways, and Eriksson is somewhat comforted.

==Production==

===Development===
The film was based on the real-life incident on Hill 192, and on Daniel Lang&#x27;s lengthy &quot;New Yorker&quot; article, &quot;Casualties of War,&quot; published in October 1969 and released as a book, with the same title, a month later. Film rights were bought by David Susskind who was to produce the film for Warner Bros. Pete Hamill wrote a script and Jack Clayton was to direct. However, the film was not made. In the meantime, Michael Verhoeven made his film based on the incident, titled &quot;o.k.&quot;. Verhoeven&#x27;s film was entered to the Berlin Film Festival in 1970, causing so much controversy among the judges, that the festival was shut down for that year with no awards given. De Palma was at that festival with his film &quot;Dionysus in &#x27;69&quot;.

In the late 1970s Susskind announced he would make the film for ABC. This did not happen.

In 1979 David Rabe mentioned the project to Brian De Palma, who was interested but was unable to raise the money to finance it. Some years later Rabe had written a script, and De Palma attached Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn as actors. They almost succeeded in getting the film financed at Paramount Pictures, but ultimately decided not to proceed when the budget went from $17 million to $20 million. De Palma then went on to make &quot;The Untouchables&quot; which was a big hit; Dawn Steel had liked the project at Paramount, and when she became head of production at Columbia Pictures, &quot;Casualties of War&quot; was the first film she green-lit.

&quot;Historically Vietnam War movies have been very profitable,&quot; said Steel. &quot;All of them. &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. You&#x27;re looking at movies that have never been not pretty successful, but very successful. The foreign numbers have been extraordinary.&quot;

===Filming===
The film was shot in April–May 1988, mostly on location in Thailand, with some filming in San Francisco. The bridge location was filmed in Kanchanaburi, Thailand, which was the same as the famous &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.

This film was Fox&#x27;s third major dramatic role. He had previously starred in &quot;Light of Day&quot; and &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;. John Leguizamo, who appeared in his first major film role, again starred with Penn in another picture by De Palma, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;.

Stephen Baldwin was originally cast as Hatcher, but was fired after only a few days of filming. He later theorized that this was due to him clashing with De Palma after questioning Penn&#x27;s use of a New York accent. Baldwin was replaced by John C. Reilly, who was already on location as an extra. This film marked Reilly&#x27;s screen debut; he worked with Penn again in &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot;, &quot;State of Grace&quot; and &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;.

&quot;Let&#x27;s be honest,&quot; said Fox at the time. &quot;If this movie makes a buck and a half it&#x27;s going to be things like &quot;Bikini&#x27;s Away&quot; for me. But to fail doing something unexpected is no disgrace. To fail doing the ordinary is a disaster. This movie is about how much you will risk if you have nothing to gain.&quot;

==Release==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Casualties of War&quot; opened in 1,487 theaters, and ranked number 4 in box office for the first week of its release. It went on to gross $18.7 million.

=== Home media ===
The theatrical cut of the film was released on DVD in 2001. This version has the original 113-minute running time. An extended cut of the film was released on DVD in 2006, that contains two scenes cut from the original release. One has Eriksson being interrogated by the two investigators, and the other is the defense attorney (played by uncredited Gregg Henry) trying to discredit Eriksson during the trial. This extended version has a running time of 119 minutes.

==Reception== 
The film holds an 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Casualties of War&quot; takes a harrowing plunge into the Vietnam War with a well-acted ensemble piece that ranks among director Brian De Palma&#x27;s more mature efforts.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, &quot;More than most films, it depends on the strength of its performances for its effect—and especially on Penn&#x27;s performance. If he is not able to convince us of his power, his rage and his contempt for the life of the girl, the movie would not work. He does, in a performance of overwhelming, brutal power.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;&#x27;Casualties of War&#x27; moves toward its climax so inevitably and surely that the courts-martial, which are the film&#x27;s penultimate sequence, are no less riveting for the theatrical way in which they have been compressed.&quot; He also called Penn&#x27;s performance &quot;extremely fine&quot; and wrote of Fox that he &quot;remains firmly in character&quot; in a &quot;difficult&quot; role. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;A powerful metaphor of the national shame that was America&#x27;s orgy of destruction in Vietnam, Brian DePalma&#x27;s film is flawed by some punch-pulling but is sure to rouse strong audience interest, even if the Columbia release will be a bitter pill for many.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and called it &quot;a major effort in a minor key because of the limitations of the simple story.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Casualties of War&quot; is DePalma&#x27;s 19th movie and easily his best. His detractors saw his Hitchcock-pastiche thrillers as manipulative and sadistic, but here he&#x27;s not dealing with stylish slashers or bloody set-pieces. He doesn&#x27;t have to reach for a shock. He&#x27;s dredging up a deeper horror: the hell that lies beneath every man&#x27;s skin, waiting to erupt.&quot; Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised it as &quot;a film of great emotional power&quot; and &quot;one of the most punishing, morally complex movies about men at war ever made.&quot;

De Palma invited Steven Spielberg to a private screening of the film, and after the screening ended, Spielberg said to Columbia Pictures executive Dawn Steel, &quot;You&#x27;ll be thinking about this for a week.&quot; The film was criticized by Vietnam veterans&#x27; groups. Quentin Tarantino has hailed the film as &quot;the greatest film about the Vietnam War.&quot;

At the time of the film&#x27;s release, David Rabe disassociated himself from it, saying that De Palma had not been faithful to his script. However, in recent years, Rabe has changed his mind on the film, praising the performances of Fox and Penn, while stating his appreciation for &quot;the near-heroism&quot; that it took for De Palma and Dawn Steel to get the film green-lit. Rabe now says that &quot;Casualties of War&quot; &quot;is a great film. I was rocked to my core seeing it again this time, and am very proud of it. What I hoped would be conveyed is there. It comes through powerfully, and there are many striking sequences of gorgeous direction and filmmaking—almost too many to count.&quot;

<doc id="226686" wikidata="Q1373357" url="?curid=226686" title="G. M. Trevelyan">
<text>George Macaulay Trevelyan (16 February 1876 – 21 July 1962) was a British historian and academic. He was a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1898 to 1903. He then spent more than twenty years as a full-time author. He returned to the University of Cambridge and was Regius Professor of History from 1927 to 1943. He served as Master of Trinity College from 1940 to 1951. In retirement, he was Chancellor of Durham University.

Trevelyan was the third son of Sir George Otto Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet, and great-nephew of Thomas Babington Macaulay. He espoused Macaulay&#x27;s staunch liberal Whig principles in accessible works of literate narrative unfettered by scholarly neutrality, his style becoming old-fashioned in the course of his long and productive career. The historian E. H. Carr considered Trevelyan to be one of the last historians of the Whig tradition.

Many of his writings promoted the Whig Party, an important British political movement from the 17th to the mid-19th centuries, as well as its successor, the Liberal Party. Whigs and Liberals believed the common people had a more positive effect on history than did royalty and that democratic government would bring about steady social progress.

Trevelyan&#x27;s history is engaged and partisan. Of his Garibaldi trilogy, &quot;reeking with bias&quot;, he remarked in his essay &quot;Bias in History&quot;: &quot;Without bias, I should never have written them at all. For I was moved to write them by a poetical sympathy with the passions of the Italian patriots of the period, which I retrospectively shared.&quot;

==Early life==

Trevelyan was born into late Victorian Britain in Welcombe House, Stratford-on-Avon, the large house and estate owned by his maternal grandfather, Robert Needham Philips, a wealthy Lancashire merchant and the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Bury. Today Welcombe is a hotel and spa for tourists visiting Shakespeare&#x27;s birthplace. On his paternal side, he was the third son of Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet, who had served as Secretary for Scotland, under Liberal Prime Ministers William Gladstone, and the Earl of Rosebery, and the grandson of Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet, who had served as a civil servant and had faced considerable criticism for his and the British government&#x27;s handling of the Great Famine of Ireland.

Trevelyan&#x27;s parents used Welcombe as a winter resort after they inherited it in 1890. They looked upon Wallington Hall, the Trevelyan family estate in Northumberland, as their real home. After attending Wixenford and Harrow, where he specialised in history, Trevelyan studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the secret society, the Cambridge Apostles and founder of the still existing Lake Hunt, a hare and hounds chase where both hounds and hares are human. In 1898, he won a fellowship at Trinity with a dissertation that was published the following year as &quot;England in the Age of Wycliffe&quot;. One professor at the university, Lord Acton, enchanted the young Trevelyan with his great wisdom and his belief in moral judgement and individual liberty.

==Garibaldi==
Trevelyan made his own reputation by depicting Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi as a great hero who stood for British ideals of liberty. According to historian David Cannadine:
[Trevelyan&#x27;s] great work was his Garibaldi trilogy (1907–11), which established his reputation as the outstanding literary historian of his generation. It depicted Garibaldi as a Carlylean hero—poet, patriot, and man of action—whose inspired leadership created the Italian nation. For Trevelyan, Garibaldi was the champion of freedom, progress, and tolerance, who vanquished the despotism, reaction, and obscurantism of the Austrian empire and the Neapolitan monarchy. The books were also notable for their vivid evocation of landscape (Trevelyan had himself followed the course of Garibaldi&#x27;s marches), for their innovative use of documentary and oral sources, and for their spirited accounts of battles and military campaigns.

Historian Lucy Voakes argues that his Garibaldi project was part of a larger movement among English intellectuals to consolidate, celebrate and sometimes critique liberal culture and politics. She sees Trevelyan&#x27;s conception of the hero, and his study of the Italian Risorgimento emerging from his promotion of a distinctly &quot;English&quot; patriotism based upon Whig gradualism, parliamentary monarchy and a hierarchical anti-republicanism.

==Role in education==
Trevelyan lectured at Cambridge until 1903, at which point he left academic life to become a full-time writer. In 1927, he returned to the university to take up a position as Regius Professor of Modern History, where the single student whose doctorate he agreed to supervise was J. H. Plumb (1936). During his professorship, he was also familiar with Guy Burgess – he gave a positive reference for Burgess when he applied for a post at the BBC in 1935, describing him as a &quot;first rate man&quot;, but also stating that &quot;He has passed through the communist measles that so many of our clever young men go through, and is well out of it&quot;. In 1940 he was appointed as Master of Trinity College and served in the post until 1951 when he retired.

Trevelyan declined the presidency of the British Academy but served as chancellor of Durham University from 1950 to 1958. Trevelyan College at Durham University is named after him. He won the 1920 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for the biography &quot;Lord Grey of the Reform Bill&quot;, was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1925, made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1950, and was an honorary doctor of many universities including Cambridge.

==Place in British ideas==

Shocked by the horrors of the Great War he saw as an ambulance driver just behind the front lines, Trevelyan became more appreciative of conservatism as a positive force, and less insistent that progress was inevitable. In &quot;History of England&quot; (1926), he searched for the deepest meaning of English history. Cannadine says he reported they were &quot;the nation&#x27;s evolution and identity: parliamentary government, the rule of law, religious toleration, freedom from continental interference or involvement, and a global horizon of maritime supremacy and imperial expansion&quot;.

Cannadine concluded in &quot;G.M. Trevelyan: A Life in History&quot; (1992):
During the first half of the twentieth century Trevelyan was the most famous, the most honored, the most influential and the most widely read historian of his generation. He was a scion of the greatest historical dynasty that (Britain) has ever produced. He knew and corresponded with many of the greatest figures of his time... For fifty years, Trevelyan acted as a public moralist, public teacher and public benefactor, wielding unchallenged cultural authority among the governing and the educated classes of his day.

Once called &quot;probably the most widely read historian in the world; perhaps in the history of the world&quot;, Trevelyan saw how two world wars shook the belief in progress. Historiography had changed and the belief in progress declined. Roy Jenkins argued:
On the other hand, J. H. Plumb argued:
==Other activities==
During World War I, Trevelyan commanded a British Red Cross ambulance unit on the Italian front; his defective eyesight meant he was unfit for military service. On 24 December 1915, he was personally decorated by king Victor Emmanuel III of Italy with the Silver Medal of Military Valor for having bravely cleared out a military hospital made the target of Austro-Hungarian fire.

In 1919, he delivered the British Academy&#x27;s Italian Lecture.

Trevelyan was the first president of the Youth Hostels Association and the YHA headquarters are called Trevelyan House in his honour. He worked throughout his career on behalf of the National Trust, in preserving not merely historic houses, but historic landscapes. He was an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1931) and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. Trevelyan was also a member of the Cambridge Apostles.

==Trevelyan&#x27;s works==
Trevelyan was a prolific author:
* His first book, based on his fellowship dissertation. The title of this work is somewhat misleading since it concentrates on the political, social and religious conditions of England during the later years of Wycliffe&#x27;s life only. Six of the nine chapters are devoted to the years 1377–1385, while the last two treat the history of the Lollards from 1382 until the Reformation. The work is critical of Roman Catholicism in favour of Wycliffe.
* Covers 1603 to 1714.
* This volume marks the entry of a new foreign historian in the field of Italian Risorgimento, a period much neglected, or, unworthily treated, outside of Italy.
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* His magnum opus in 3 volumes: &quot;Blenheim&quot; (1930), &quot;Ramillies and the Union with Scotland&quot; (1932), &quot;Peace and the Protestant Succession&quot; (1934).
* 
* Portrays James II as a tyrant whose excesses led directly to the Glorious Revolution.
* Published during the darkest days of World War Two, it painted a nostalgic picture of England&#x27;s glorious past as the beacon of liberty and progress, stirring patriotic feelings and becoming his best selling book, also his last major history book.

<text>The Hacienda is the current designation for a historic hotel in Monterey County, near the town of Jolon, California. It was completed in 1930 for use by William Randolph Hearst as temporary housing for his employees and guests and headquarters for activities taking place on the surrounding land. The lodge building, designed by architect Julia Morgan, replaced and expanded upon an earlier wooden structure known as the Milpitas Ranch House which was destroyed by fire in the 1920s. The 1930 hotel has also been known as Milpitas Hacienda, Hacienda Guest Lodge and Milpitas Ranchhouse, under which name the property was placed in the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1977.

The lodge currently has guest rooms and a bar but no food services. It is located within an active US Army Reserve unit, and guests must have proof of lodge reservations and a Real ID or passport to pass through a manned guard gate to reach the lodge. 

Hearst sold the structure and its surrounding property to the United States Army in 1940 for use as a training facility. The land and buildings were established by the Army as Fort Hunter Liggett. Today, the Army owns the building and a concessionaire operates it as a public hotel within the military base.

==History==

The fertile valley surrounding The Hacienda was documented by Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portolà in 1769. Based on his recommendation, Father Junípero Serra established Mission San Antonio de Padua in the valley in 1771, and it thrived. Of all the California missions, San Antonio de Padua converted the highest number of Native Americans, peaking at 1,300 Salinan converts in 1805. In the 1830s, the mission was secularized and its holdings were divided into at least ten land grants (including &quot;Rancho Milpitas&quot;, or Little Corn Fields Ranch) given to soldiers and civilians supportive of Mexican government. English-speaking settlers began arriving in significant numbers in 1849 with the discovery of gold in California. Nearby Jolon was established as a gold mining town on an old Salinan village site in 1860, astride El Camino Real, the old road connecting all the Spanish missions in California.

===Hearst===
At the beginning of the 20th century, gold mining had petered out and Hearst began buying up property in the area. Over the next two decades, he amassed land holdings covering the entirety of four of the ten Mexican land grants and most of Jolon. On top of the old &quot;Rancho Milpitas&quot; main ranch house site, at the edge of a small hill and about half a mile from and overlooking the old mission, Hearst hired Morgan to build a new ranch headquarters. Construction on the Mission Revival-styled building complex began in 1929, using poured concrete instead of adobe. A smoothly domed north tower was built in Moorish Revival style above the main living quarters. Original plans for the building were for it to include housing for 20 employees but this was expanded to 30 during construction. A proposed southern wing for Hearst&#x27;s private quarters was never completed. Materials were carried from Santa Cruz in a Fageol truck. Construction costs totaled $200,000.
The building was not originally supplied with electricity. Wires for a single telephone line were run from Hearst Castle away. Wood stoves and fireplaces supplied heat, candles and lanterns provided light, and a well near the San Antonio River fed a cistern positioned a short distance uphill to the east to supply water pressure for a modern plumbing system. Those staying at The Hacienda year-round included the ranch manager, mechanics, gardeners, cooks and a ranch foreman who supervised cowboys tending cattle and farmhands harvesting wheat, barley, oats and alfalfa.

Hearst&#x27;s guests could drive in, fly in and land at an adjacent landing strip, or they could arrive by horseback after a full day&#x27;s ride from San Simeon. Guests included Spencer Tracy, Dick Powell, Will Rogers, Clark Gable, Herbert Hoover, Jean Harlow, Leslie Howard and Errol Flynn. Hearst&#x27;s paramour, Marion Davies, stayed in one of the four tower suites when she visited. Californio-style fiestas were thrown in the guests&#x27; honor, complete with mariachis playing from the dining room balcony.

Although hunting in the area was enjoyed by sportsmen both before and after Hearst&#x27;s ownership, Hearst did not allow any hunting on his property, and the California State Military Museum has concluded that The Hacienda was not built as a hunting lodge. Other observers have described the building as Hearst&#x27;s hunting lodge.

===Army===

On December 12, 1940, Hearst sold , including the old Milpitas Ranch, to the United States government. Neighboring landowners sold another to form a training base for the War Department. The US Army used The Hacienda as housing for the base commander, for visiting officers and for the officers&#x27; club.

In 1957, a serviceman named Bill Runyan painted heroic murals depicting Spanish settlement of the area on selected interior walls of The Hacienda. Runyan started the large murals when he was a soldier at the fort but stayed on as a civil service carpenter to complete the task. Smaller ornamental paintings in the hotel date from the Hearst decade and were touched up or repainted by the Army.

===National Park Service study===

In November 1999, Congress authorized a study of Fort Hunter Liggett partly in response to a 1995 recommendation made by a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission which listed certain structures within the base as excess to the Army&#x27;s needs. In 2004, the National Park Service (NPS) released an environmental assessment draft which identified for further study the Julia Morgan-designed Milpitas Hacienda complex including the swimming pool, tennis court and outbuildings as well as a number of other historic structures on the base and in the area. The NPS wrote that inclusion of the Milpitas Hacienda in the national park system would offer an opportunity to enhance visitor experience and expand their understanding of the lives and work of Morgan and Hearst. The NPS described the Milpitas Hacienda as representing the themes &quot;expressing cultural values&quot; and &quot;developing the American economy&quot; for its connection to Hearst and his media empire. Two alternatives were put forward: one where no action would be taken, and one where title to the Milpitas Hacienda and nearby bungalows would be transferred to California State Parks to be managed as an addition to the Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument.

The US Army sent NPS a letter on May 27, 2005, stating that the BRAC property was no longer excess to the Army and was now required in order to support the Army&#x27;s mission. This reversal in status for The Hacienda caused the NPS to re-evaluate its study of title transfer and management options, and to cease environmental assessment. On September 19, 2006, NPS submitted to Congress its final report which concluded that a number of national resources in and around Fort Hunter Liggett including the Milpitas Hacienda complex were suitable for inclusion in the national park system but that such an action was not currently feasible because none of the land or buildings were excess to the Army&#x27;s needs. The NPS encouraged the Army &quot;to continue its protection and management of the natural and cultural resources in a manner that retains their national significance.&quot;

Today, the United States Army Reserve operates the base, and a civilian concessionaire is allowed to run The Hacienda as a hotel open both to the public and to the military. Visitor access to the base, the hotel and the old Spanish mission is monitored through an Army checkpoint.

<text>To publish is to make content available to the general public. While specific use of the term may vary among countries, it is usually applied to text, images, or other audio-visual content, including paper (newspapers, magazines, catalogs, etc.). Publication means the act of publishing, and also any copies issued for public distribution.

==Legal definition and copyright==
 is a in legal contexts and especially important in copyright legislation. An author of a work generally is the initial owner of the copyright on the work. One of the copyrights granted to the author of a work is the exclusive right to publish the work.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, publication is defined as:

=== United States ===
In the United States, publication is defined as:

The US Copyright Office provides further guidance in Circular 40, which states:

Generally, the right to publish a work is an exclusive right of copyright owner (17 USC 106), and violating this right (e.g. by disseminating copies of the work without the copyright owner&#x27;s consent) is a copyright infringement (17 USC 501(a)), and the copyright owner can demand (by suing in court) that e.g. copies distributed against their will be confiscated and destroyed (17 USC 502, 17 USC 503). Exceptions and limitations are written into copyright law, however; for example, the exclusive rights of the copyright owner eventually expire, and even when in force, they do not extend to publications covered by fair use or certain types of uses by libraries and educational institutions.

The definition of &quot;publication&quot; as &quot;distribution of copies to the general public with the consent of the author&quot; is also supported by the Berne Convention, which makes mention of &quot;copies&quot; in article 3(3), where &quot;published works&quot; are defined. In the Universal Copyright Convention, &quot;publication&quot; is defined in article VI as &quot;the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived.&quot; Many countries around the world follow this definition, although some make some exceptions for particular kinds of works. In Germany, §6 of the &quot;Urheberrechtsgesetz&quot; additionally considers works of the visual arts (such as sculptures) &quot;published&quot; if they have been made permanently accessible by the general public (i.e., erecting a sculpture on public grounds is publication in Germany). Australia and the UK (as the U.S.) do not have this exception and generally require the distribution of copies necessary for publication. In the case of sculptures, the copies must be even three-dimensional.

==Biological classification==
In biological classification (taxonomy), the &quot;publication&quot; of the description of a taxon has to comply with some rules. The definition of the &quot;publication&quot; is defined in nomenclature codes. Traditionally there were the following rules:
*The publication must be generally available.
*The date of publication is the date the published material became generally available.

Electronic publication with some restrictions is permitted for publication of scientific names of fungi since 1 January 2013.

==Types==
===Material types===
There are many material types of publication, some of which are:
* Book or codex: a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages bound together and protected by a cover.
* Booklet: a leaflet of more than one sheet of paper, usually attached in the style of a book.
* Broadside: a large single sheet of paper printed on one side, designed to be plastered onto walls, produced from the 16th to 19th centuries, obsolete with the development of newspapers and cheap novels.
* Flyer or handbill: a small sheet of paper printed on one side, designed to be handed out free.
* Leaflet: a single sheet of paper printed on both sides and folded.
* Pamphlet: an unbound book.

==== Electronic publishing ====

Electronic publishing (also referred to as e-publishing or digital publishing) includes the digital publication of websites, webpages, e-books, digital editions of periodical publications, and the development of digital libraries. It is now common to distribute books, magazines, and newspapers to consumers online. Publications may also be published on electronic media such as CD-ROMs.

===Content types===
Types of publication can also be distinguished by content, for example:
* Brochure: an informative document made for advertising products or services, usually in the form of a pamphlet or leaflet.
* Bulletin: information written in short on a flyer or inside another publication for public viewing, or a brief message or announcement broadcast to a wide audience by way of television, radio, or internet.
* Journal: a periodical publication in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published.
* Magazine: a periodical publication, generally published on a regular schedule (often weekly or monthly), containing a variety of content.
* Monograph: a long research publication written by one person.
* Newsletter: a bulletin, leaflet, pamphlet, or newspaper distributed to a specific audience.
* Newspaper: a periodical publication of several pages printed with news, sports, information, and advertising, and which may be published and distributed daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually.
* Tract: a religious or political argument written by one person and designed to be distributed free, usually in the form of a booklet or pamphlet, but sometimes longer.

===Type standards===

ISO 690, a set of guidelines for bibliographic references and citations to information resources, defines a as a &quot;message or document offered for general distribution or sale and usually produced in multiple copies&quot;, and lists types of publications including monographs and their components and serials and their components. Common bibliographic software specifications such as BibTeX and Citation Style Language also list types of publications, as do various standards for library cataloging. For example, RDA, a cataloging standard adopted by the Library of Congress in 2013 and by some other national libraries, differentiates between , , and of information resources.

==Unpublished works==

A work that has not undergone publication, and thus is not generally available to the public, or for citation in scholarly or legal contexts, is called an unpublished work. In some cases unpublished works are widely cited, or circulated via informal means. An author who has not yet published a work may also be referred to as being unpublished.

The status of being unpublished has specific significance in the legal context, where it may refer to the non-publication of legal opinions in the United States.

<doc id="226693" wikidata="Q216056" url="?curid=226693" title="Henry Muhlenberg">
<text>Henry Melchior Muhlenberg (born Heinrich Melchior Mühlenberg; September 6, 1711 – October 7, 1787), was a German-born Lutheran clergyman and missionary. Born in Einbeck, Muhlenberg immigrated to the Province of Pennsylvania in response to demands from Lutherans for missionary work in the colony. Muhlenberg was integral to the founding of the first Lutheran church body or denomination in North America, and is considered the patriarch of the Lutheran Church in the United States.

Muhlenberg and his wife Anna Maria had a large family, and they and their descendants had a significant impact on colonial life in North America as pastors, military officers, and politicians. He and Anna Maria&#x27;s descendants continued to be active in Pennsylvania and national political life.

==Early life and education==

Muhlenberg was born on September 6, 1711, in Einbeck in the Electorate of Hanover, Germany, to Nicolaus Melchior Mühlenberg and Anna Maria Kleinschmid. He studied theology at the University of Göttingen. As a student, Muhlenberg came under the influence of the Pietist movement through fellow students from Einbeck who had worked at the Francke Foundations in Halle, an important Pietist institution. With two other men, Muhlenberg started a charity school in Göttingen that eventually became an orphanage.

==Career==
After completing his studies in the spring 1738, Muhlenberg secured a teaching position at the Francke Foundation&#x27;s Historic Orphanage. Its director, the theologian Gotthilf August Francke was the son and successor of the Foundation&#x27;s founder, August Hermann Francke and a professor at the University of Halle.

Muhlenberg was ordained in Leipzig in 1739, and served as assistant minister and director of the orphanage at Grosshennersdorf from 1739 to 1741. In 1741, Gotthilf August Francke encouraged Muhlenberg to accept a call from German-speaking Lutherans in Pennsylvania. Accordingly, in 1742 Muhlenberg emigrated across the Atlantic Ocean, where he essentially organized the Lutheran Church as an institution in North America.

===Lutheran Church in Pennsylvania and New Jersey===
The Lutheran churches in Pennsylvania had largely been founded by lay ministers. After Nicolaus Zinzendorf was successful in winning a number of converts to the Moravian Church, the Lutherans asked German churches for formally trained clergy.

In 1742, Muhlenberg immigrated to Philadelphia, responding to the 1732 request by Pennsylvania Lutherans. He took charge Augustus Lutheran Church in present-day Trappe, Pennsylvania. He also provided leadership to a series of congregations elsewhere, including those from Maryland to New York, where he worked to secure control over less qualified pastors and started new congregations among the settlers of the region.

In 1748, he formed the Pennsylvania Ministerium, the first permanent Lutheran synod in the United States. He helped prepare a uniform liturgy the same year and wrote basic tenets for an ecclesiastical constitution, which most of the churches adopted in 1761. He did much work on a hymnal, published by the Ministerium in 1786.

The dedication stone of the Augustus Lutheran Church, above its door, is dedicated to Muhlenberg and its other founders. It reads, in Latin, translated into English: &quot;Under the auspices of Christ, Henry Melchior Muhlenberg with his Council, J.N.Crosman, F.Marsteller, A.Heilman, J.Mueller, H.Haas, and H.Rebner, erected from the very foundation this building dedicated by the Society of the Augsburg Confession. A.D.1743.&quot; The name of the first church—Augustus—was adopted in honor of Herman Augustus Francke, founder of the Halle Institutions, whose son, Gotthilf, had persuaded Muhlenberg to accept the call of the three United Congregations in America.

Muhlenberg frequently traveled beyond the three congregations assigned to him. During his 45-year ministry, his journeys reached from New York to Georgia. He ministered to the German language populations he was assigned to, and also to colonists from the Netherlands and Great Britain in their native languages. His colleagues requested his help in arbitrating disputes among Lutherans, or in some cases, with other religious groups.

Muhlenberg worked to recruit new ministers from Europe and to develop more ministers from the colonists. Built in 1774 in Washington Township, New Jersey, the Old Stone Union Church housed a congregation largely organized by Muhlenberg. His eldest son, Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, also served as pastor there and served as a major general in the Continental Army.

Poor health forced him into limited activity and retirement. On October 7, 1787, Muhlenberg died at his home in Trappe, Pennsylvania, at age 76. He is interred in the rear of Augustus Lutheran Church, as are his wife Anna Maria and their son Peter. At his request, he was buried next to the grave of his good friend, sponsor, and Augustus Church co-founder, Frederick Ludwig Marsteller.

==Legacy==

Soon after arriving in Pennsylvania in 1745, Muhlenberg married Anna Maria Weiser, the daughter of colonial leader Conrad Weiser. The couple had eleven children and founded the Muhlenberg Family dynasty, generations of which were active in the U.S. military, politics, academia, and ministry.

Among his children, three sons entered the ministry and became prominent in other fields, a fourth, Peter, became a scientist and academic, a Major General in the Continental Army, and later was elected to the United States Congress; Frederick served as the first Speaker of the House in the U.S. Congress after his election to office; Henry, Jr. became pastor of the Zion Lutheran Church at Oldwick, New Jersey; and Henry Ernst was an early scientist and the first president of Franklin College, which is now Franklin &amp; Marshall College.

His daughter Elisabeth married future general Francis Swaine. Maria Salome (&quot;Sally&quot;) married the future U.S. Congressman Matthias Richards. Eve married Emmanuel Shulze, and their son John Andrew Schulze was elected Governor of Pennsylvania.
==Legacy and honors==
*Henry Melchior Muhlenberg is commemorated on October 7 in the Calendar of Saints in worship books and hymnals such as the Lutheran Book of Worship, Lutheran Worship, Evangelical Lutheran Worship, Lutheran Service Book, and in supplementary ecumenical common liturgies and lectionaries used by most Lutheran congregations in the United States and Canada.
*Muhlenberg College, an ELCA-affiliated institution in Allentown, Pennsylvania is named in his honor.
*The &quot;Muhlenberg Monument&quot;, named &quot;Man of Vision&quot; and sculpted by American artist Stanley Wanlass, is located on the campus of Muhlenberg College.
*Lake Muhlenberg, located near the college in Allentown, is named in his honor.
*The Henry Melchior Muhlenberg House was added to the National Register of Historic Places, maintained by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, in 2000.
*The Muhlenberg Building at 13th &amp; Spruce Streets in Center City Philadelphia and the Muhlenberg Building at 2900 Queens Lane in Northwest Philadelphia. The former is a 1922 Collegiate Gothic high-rise designed by Clarence Edmond Wunder that served as the headquarters for the United Lutheran Publication House (ULPH)--the official press of the United Lutheran Church in America (ULCA) until the 1960s; the latter is a distinctive U-shaped two-story structure of Georgian and Federal architectural style with red brick, white wood, and limestone trim that served as the headquarters of ULPH&#x27;s successors Muhlenberg Press and then its successor, Fortress Press of the Lutheran Church in America (LCA). Both contained the editorial offices of &quot;The Lutheran&quot;, the bi-monthly magazine of both the ULCA and the LCA. The former building now functions as an apartment complex, while the latter is now part of Drexel University&#x27;s College of Medicine.

<doc id="226694" wikidata="Q4978525" url="?curid=226694" title="Bruce foil">
<text>A Bruce foil is a variant of the leeboard, consisting of a foil typically mounted on an outrigger and always set at an angle to provide both lateral and vertical force. It was invented by Edmond Bruce in the early 1960s, and first published in the Amateur Yacht Research Society publication in April 1965.

==Theory==
Nearly all methods that increase resistance to sideways movement also cause heeling, the leaning produced by the imbalance of the forces on the sails, high above the waterline, and the sideways resistance, generated by the centerboard or other foil below the waterline. The resulting torque causes the hull to heel until the buoyancy of the hull provides sufficient torque to balance the heeling force. The limited buoyancy of the hull therefore limits the amount of force that the sail can effectively produce.

One solution to dealing with this limit is to bring the forces generated by the sail and the underwater foil into alignment, canceling as much of the torque as possible and thus reducing the amount of heeling. Two approaches to this have surfaced one being the inclined rig, and the other the Bruce foil.

==Implementation==
A Bruce foil reduces torque by moving the foil far out from the centerline of the hull, and angling it so that a perpendicular line through the center of the underwater portion of the foil will intersect the center of pressure of the sails. Like a traditional centerboard, the Bruce foil is generally a symmetric design, such as the NACA 00xx series, which relies on the leeward slip of the hull to provide the angle of attack needed to generate lift. When mounted on the lee side, the Bruce foil generates an upwards lift in addition to lateral force, and when mounted on the windward side, it generates a downwards force.

Bruce foils can be mounted in pairs, one on each side, as used in some trimaran designs. In this case, the leeward foil works in conjunction with the leeward ama to provide lift, and the windward foil can be retracted to reduce drag.

At equilibrium, the force from the foil and the sail will always be balanced, so capsize should be impossible, but in practice that is not the case. Since the foil&#x27;s force is relative to the hull&#x27;s movement through the water, and the sail&#x27;s force is relative to the wind moving past the sail, sudden changes in wind speed or direction can unbalance the foil and cause heeling. In addition, a foil on the windward side presents an unstable situation, since any lifting of the foil out of the water, by mechanisms such as heeling or wave action, will result in reduced downwards force, potentially leading to capsize. A lee foil provides more stability, as loss of lift will force the foil back into the water.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The main advantages over a typical centerboard or leeboard is that the Bruce foil allows the sails to remain nearly upright and keep the full force of the wind available to drive movement without the crew needing to move their weight. The main disadvantage is that the sails remain upright and keep the full force of the wind available, rather than depowering with increasing angle of heel as happens with traditional foils. The Bruce foil also produces increased drag as a result of the vertical component of force, as well as a yawing force due to the off-center placement of the foil, which may require alteration of the steering system to compensate.

<text>Sidney Davis (April 1, 1916 – October 16, 2006) was an American director and producer who specialized in social guidance films.

==Early life==
Davis was born on April 1, 1916, in Chicago, Illinois to a seamstress mother and a housepainter father. The family moved to Los Angeles, California in 1920, when Davis was four years old. That year, he began working as a child actor; for example, he was featured in a comedy made by Harold Lloyd. He dropped out of junior-high school to help support his parents. When he was older, he often worked as a stand-in for Leif Erickson and John Wayne.

==Filmmaking career==

In November 1949, Linda Joyce Glucoft, a six-year-old girl in Los Angeles, California, was molested and murdered by a man named Fred Stroble. The story made front-page news in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; for a week as police and the FBI searched for Stroble. The story was picked up by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; and other national media and led to a flurry of reported rapes and attempted rapes. Some media began to speculate that the supposed epidemic of rape was simply media manipulation of public perception.

Davis stated that the tragedy particularly disturbed him because his daughter Jill, then six years old herself, did not seem to pay attention to his warnings about strangers. Davis talked to John Wayne saying that a film about this should be made, and Wayne suggested that Davis make the film. Wayne gave Davis $1,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) and used the money to make his first film, &quot;The Dangerous Stranger&quot;, a film he would remake at least twice over the next 30 years. The film tells the story of several young children—some of the children are kidnapped and eventually saved, others are kidnapped and never seen again. Davis used schoolchildren and police officers instead of professional actors. Peter L. Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said &quot;[t]he film was a success among schools and police departments&quot;.

Davis sold copies of the film to schools and police departments, reaping a $250,000 profit. He used the money to make more than 150 films over the next few decades. Davis&#x27; films are typically 10 to 30 minutes long; he prided himself on making each one for $1,000, a minuscule film budget even at that time. Due to the content of his films, people referred to him as the &quot;King of Calamity&quot;.

His films cover topics such as driver safety, marijuana use, heroin addiction, and gang warfare. &quot;Live and Learn&quot; (1951), a fairly famous Davis film, features Jill cutting out paper dolls in her room. When her father comes home, she jumps up to greet him, trips on the carpet, and impales herself on the scissors. Other children in the film are equally unlucky—falling off cliffs, being run over by cars, or losing vision in one eye from flying shards of glass.

One of Davis&#x27; most notorious films, &quot;Boys Beware&quot; (1961), produced with the cooperation of the Inglewood, California Police Department and the Inglewood Unified School District, warns boys of the perceived dangers of male homosexuals, predatory pedophiles. The film includes the line &quot;What Jimmy didn&#x27;t know was that Ralph was sick—a sickness that was not visible like smallpox, but no less dangerous and contagious—a sickness of the mind. You see, Ralph was a homosexual: a person who demands an intimate relationship with members of their own sex.&quot; Many commentators have pointed out that the &quot;educational&quot; film simply spread hateful stereotypes and bigotry. &quot;It might be easy to laugh at the stupidity of &quot;Boys Beware&quot; if the film wasn&#x27;t so virulent in equating homosexuality and pedophilia. There is a world of difference between adults having consensual intercourse and adults abusing children, and even at this late date too many stupid people cannot tell the difference. Films like &quot;Boys Beware&quot; reinforced a culture of homophobia which is only recently being chipped away by voices of intelligence and common sense.&quot; The same year, Davis made &quot;Girls Beware&quot;, warning girls not to put themselves into situations where they would be defenseless, a topic that Davis had covered at least 10 years earlier in his film &quot;Name Unknown&quot;, in which a man used a gun to accost a couple in isolated surroundings, forcing the boy into the trunk of the car and raping the girl.

Also in 1961, Davis made the film &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, targeting teenagers with the message that marijuana use leads to heroin addiction, a message that many marijuana activists dispute as an example of a slippery slope fallacy. The film follows a teenage girl through her use of &quot;reds&quot;, &quot;pep pills&quot;, and 7-Up, to her first puff of marijuana, to her addiction to heroin, to her fate as a prostitute arrested on her twentieth birthday, &quot;lost to society&quot;. The film promises that &quot;she&#x27;ll continue her hopeless, degrading existence until she escapes in death.&quot;

In 1964 his company Sid Davis Productions distributed his film &quot;Too Tough to Care&quot;, aimed at undermining teenage resistance to anti-smoking education. The film used satire and humor, in a short story with no narration, to illustrate the misleading claims of cigarette advertising – an unconventional approach for its genre. The film garnered positive reviews in the mainstream press as well as coverage in academic journals.

Davis&#x27; work is consistently about a relatively small group of themes: that strangers must be treated with caution, that the world itself is an unfriendly place, regardless of the presence of strangers, and that children must think before acting. His films typically feature monotonous narration suffused with what &quot;Mental Hygiene&quot; author Ken Smith calls a &quot;sledgehammer morality.&quot; His work is anecdotal and unsupported by evidence, and is notorious among social guidance films because Davis covered topics that scholarly film producers such as Coronet Films and Encyclopædia Britannica did not address. Coronet, Centron Corporation, and Britannica typically had teams of scholars with PhDs in sociology who guided development of their films. Davis, when he used consultants, rarely used anyone with a degree in a relevant field, instead he used policemen and detectives for their anecdotal advice.

Aside from his social warning films generally known for their bleakness, inaccuracy and simplistic presentations, Davis made some police training films such as &quot;Shotgun or Sidearm?&quot; (explaining which situations call for which firearms) and military films such as &quot;LAPES&quot; and &quot;PLADS&quot; (explaining delivery systems developed to allow planes to drop supplies onto exact locations in generally hostile territory in Vietnam).

Two atypical films in his social warning film canon are &quot;Gang Boy&quot; (1954) and &quot;Age 13&quot; (1955). Both were written and directed by Art Swerdloff. In &quot;Gang Boy&quot;, Mexican and Anglo gangs in southern California declare a truce and begin working together to make a better world for their younger siblings. The film was based on a true story that happened in Pomona, California, in the 1950s.

After a few years of directing films, Davis continued as a cinematographer for his company, Sid Davis Productions, hiring others such as Art Swerdloff, Robert D. Ellis, and Ib Melchior to write and direct. Later he hired cinematographers to lens the films as well as office workers to distribute them and spent his time enjoying his hobby of mountain climbing.

Davis became involved in the real estate market in Los Angeles during the 1950s, at a time when it was booming due to development resulting from the influx of people to work in the defense industry. Through income from his films, work as a stand-in, and real estate investments, Davis became a multimillionaire.

Later in his life, Davis became famous among mountain climbers, securing the world record for climbing California&#x27;s Mt. San Jacinto, climbing it 643 times over his life, the last time on September 1, 1998, at age 82.

==Filmography==
Margalit Fox of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;Mr. Davis lost count of all the films he made, but there seem to have been at least 150, perhaps as many as 200.&quot; Fox, in the year 2006, said &quot;[t]o modern audiences, Mr. Davis&#x27;s work can look like high camp. Some of his films have aged strikingly badly, in particular &quot;Boys Beware&quot;,[...]&quot; Rick Prelinger, a historian specializing in nontheatrical films, stated that some of Davis&#x27;s works had, in 2006, artistic merit, citing &quot;Age 13&quot; and &quot;Gang Boy&quot;.

===Availability of his films===
Davis&#x27; films &quot;Age 13&quot;, &quot;Gang Boy&quot;, &quot;The Terrible Truth&quot; (another anti-drug film), and &quot;The Dropout&quot; are available on Volume 5 of Rick Prelinger&#x27;s CD-ROM set &quot;Our Secret Century&quot;. His films &quot;The Terrible Truth&quot; and &quot;Boys Beware,&quot; are available online at archive.org here and here, respectively. His Film, &quot;The ABC of Walking Wisely&quot;, and a short, &quot;Santa and the Fairy Snow Queen&quot;, are available in digital form, with humorous commentary, from &quot;Rifftrax&quot;, an entertainment group made of performers previously with the similar &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1941 he met Norma Henkins, who worked as a film extra. Six months later, the two married. He had a daughter, Jill. Norma Henkins died in 1996.

==Death==
Davis died in his house on October 16, 2006, in Palm Desert, California, at age 90, of lung cancer. At the time of his death, he had a companion, Shirley Friesen, and a grandson.

<doc id="226704" wikidata="Q646645" url="?curid=226704" title="Korn (album)">
<text>Korn (printed and stylized as KoЯn) is the debut studio album by the American nu metal band Korn. It was released on October 11, 1994, through Immortal and Epic Records. Before recording the album, the band was approached by Immortal/Epic Records after a performance in Huntington Beach, California. The band signed to their label because they did not want to &quot;sign away all of their creative freedom&quot;. The band would record at Indigo Ranch Studios in Malibu, California, with producer Ross Robinson, who also produced their 1993 demo &quot;Neidermayer&#x27;s Mind&quot;. The recording took place from May to June 1994. After the recordings, Korn toured with Biohazard and House of Pain. The North American leg of their tour included The Deftones as their opening act. 

The album&#x27;s themes include child abuse, drug abuse, and bullying. The album cover depicts a young girl sitting on a swing being approached by a large man who is holding what appears to be horseshoes or possibly blades. Furthermore, the girl&#x27;s shadow gives the appearance that her body is being hanged due to the position of the band&#x27;s logo. Photography was done by Stephen Stickler, and the design was directed by Jay Papke and Dante Ariola.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Blind&quot;, charted at number 15 on the Canadian Alternative 30, and the album peaked at number 10 in New Zealand as well as number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album had sold at least 2.1 million copies in the United States by 2003. Many consider the album to have started the nu metal genre.

Korn toured with many bands to promote the album. Initially, Korn joined the Sick of It All Tour. Following the Sick of It All Tour, Korn joined the Danzig 4 Tour. Korn also toured with Megadeth, Fear Factory, and Flotsam and Jetsam.

==Background==
Before Korn came up with their name, they had moved into a small house together in Huntington Beach, California, south of Los Angeles, where they began working on songs. Soon after moving, they rented Underground Chicken Sounds, a recording studio, from Jeff Creath, who had previously allowed lead singer Jonathan Davis to live in his garage. While they were recording at the studio, they attracted a crowd of people when performing the prelude to &quot;Clown&quot;. The band&#x27;s bass guitarist, Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu, said that the crowd gathered because the band&#x27;s style sounded so &quot;different&quot;. Korn was formed in 1993. Within two weeks of their establishment, they recorded a demo containing &quot;Blind&quot;, &quot;Predictable&quot;, and &quot;Daddy&quot;. A couple of weeks later, Korn played their first-ever show at a club called California Dreams in Anaheim. Korn began playing gigs in the summer of 1993. While performing at Huntington Beach, the band was spotted by Immortal/Epic A&amp;R Paul Pontius. He approached the band offering to record an album through their company. Although the group had offers from several other labels, Korn went with Immortal/Epic because they did not want to &quot;sign away all of their creative freedom&quot;.

==Recording and production==

While Korn was looking for a place to record their debut album, they asked producer Ross Robinson to produce their album. After accepting the offer, Robinson suggested they record at Indigo Ranch, Malibu, California. The band would record the majority of the album there, while additional recording took place at Bakersfield&#x27;s Fat Tracks. Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously, as opposed to recording instruments separately. In addition, Indigo Ranch was located on a hill rather than in the city, allowing them to record outside, resulting in the &quot;distinctive&quot; sound and quality of music given off by their instruments. The banging sound near the ending of &quot;Ball Tongue&quot; was created via a guitar cord striking a music stand. The bagpipes on &quot;Shoots and Ladders&quot; are often thought to have been recorded on a mountain-top. However, they were actually recorded with a microphone set up at the back door of the studio while Jonathan Davis walked past outside playing. As he walked further from the microphone, this led to the sound naturally fading quieter. Davis said that &quot;Daddy&quot; features him singing the song alone in the dark without knowing that his vocals were being recorded. Korn finished recording the album by the end of June 1994. 

As Robinson produced the album, his career was launched by its success, as it &quot;taught Robinson how to produce.&quot; In an interview with the heavy metal magazine &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, Davis touted Robinson&#x27;s behavior, saying: &quot;Ross is a very pure and clean-spirited person, and you feel it when you&#x27;re with him. He&#x27;s the kind of person that can draw that out of you. I felt very safe with Ross.&quot; The album was released on October 11, 1994, through Immortal and Epic Records. During the recording of &quot;Korn&quot;, there were four outtakes: &quot;Christmas Song&quot;, &quot;Sean Olson&quot;, &quot;Layla&quot;, and &quot;This Broken Soul&quot;. &quot;Sean Olson&quot; was put on the single release of &quot;Shoots and Ladders&quot;, and featured on &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot; soundtrack. In 2015, Davis ranked the 1994 debut album as his favorite Korn album.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, &quot;Korn&quot; has been described as nu metal and alternative metal. The album begins with &quot;Blind&quot;, starting with the dueling riffs of James Shaffer and Brian Welch. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis&#x27; first line is &quot;Are you ready?!&quot;, which has become one of the band&#x27;s trademarks. Davis told &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; that on the album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Ball Tongue&quot;, he &quot;didn&#x27;t sing a goddamn word in that song. I couldn&#x27;t describe what I wanted to do, so that&#x27;s how it came out. It&#x27;s a really heavy sound.&quot; &quot;Shoots and Ladders&quot; explores the concept of nursery rhymes. Davis says &quot;&#x27;Shoots and Ladders&#x27; uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes, the first songs many of us ever hear. &#x27;Shoots and Ladders&#x27;, to set the record straight, calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are. I choose each rhyme for a different reason—&#x27;Baa Baa Black Sheep&#x27; has racist overtones. &#x27;London Bridge&#x27; talks of all the people of London dying (from the Black Plague, as does &#x27;Ring Around the Roses&#x27;). Then there&#x27;s &#x27;Little Red Riding Hood&#x27;—one story tells of the wolf raping Red Riding Hood and killing her.&quot; &quot;Clown&quot; concept deals with an incident that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead who told Davis to &quot;go back to Bakersfield&quot; attempted to hit Davis but he dodged, and the band&#x27;s road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. According to Davis and Brian Welch, current Metallica and then-Suicidal Tendencies bassist Robert Trujillo helped them write the song &quot;Divine.&quot; &quot;Helmet in the Bush&quot; was about Davis&#x27; drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him at the height of his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare. Davis explained: &quot;I&#x27;d wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed (methamphetamine) in the morning, I&#x27;d have it all lined up for breakfast so when I&#x27;d lay down and go to sleep, I&#x27;d wake up and just snort and it&#x27;s like &#x27;Yeah, okay, I&#x27;m up.&#x27; It was bad. It&#x27;s like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able to keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that.&quot; Davis said that &quot;Helmet in the Bush&quot; &quot;is about meth. It&#x27;s about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it&#x27;s literally a helmet in the bush [laughs]&quot;. &quot;Basically it&#x27;s what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children,&quot; Munky elaborated. &quot;Faget&quot; lyrical themes are about Davis&#x27; time in high school where he was relentlessly bullied primarily by jocks for wearing eyeliner, listening to new wave and enjoying the arts. He was constantly called names like &quot;fag&quot; or &quot;faggot&quot;. Davis talked about the song in an interview saying,

&quot;Daddy&quot;, the album&#x27;s longest track, saw Davis &quot;descending very real tears.&quot; Davis said that the song&#x27;s concept deals with his childhood, saying &quot;People think &#x27;Daddy&#x27; was written because my father abused me, but that&#x27;s not what the song&#x27;s about. When I was a kid, I was being abused by someone else. I don&#x27;t really like to talk about that song.&quot; Though the song ends at 9:32, a hidden track which depicts an argument between a man and his wife over a Dodge Dart carburetor can be heard at 14:05 after about 4.5 minutes of silence.

==Marketing and promotion==
Stephen Stickler acted as the band&#x27;s photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola directed the album&#x27;s cover art and booklet. The cover depicts Paul Pontius&#x27; niece in a blue school uniform with a matching bow in her blonde hair, bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her. The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground, and is holding what appears to be a horse shoe or, more presumably, blades. The band&#x27;s logo, a childlike drawing of the band&#x27;s name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by the man. The back cover of the album complements the front, showing the empty playground.

After Korn finished recording the album, they went on a club tour of California (which included shows with No Doubt, Testament, Pennywise, and Deftones, among others) before going on tour with Biohazard and House of Pain at free gigs. Korn personally passed out flyers at their performances. Major label Immortal/Epic gave them enough money for their own tour bus. Korn&#x27;s first gig was in Atlanta, Georgia. About halfway through the tour, the tour bus that their record executives gave them stopped working, forcing the band to find a new one. This first tour proved very unsuccessful in promoting the album. Aside from them touring, Korn released four singles. &quot;Blind&quot; was the lead single, released in 1994, followed by &quot;Need To&quot;, &quot;Shoots and Ladders&quot;, and &quot;Clown&quot;.

Despite this, Korn resumed touring in the Sick of It All Tour, beginning on January 21, 1995, and ending in March 1995. Following the Sick of It All Tour, Korn joined the Danzig 4 Tour, including Danzig and Marilyn Manson. The tour lasted three months and was preceded with the group touring with Megadeth, where they played to crowds of thirty-five-hundred to five thousand. They toured with Megadeth, Fear Factory, and Flotsam and Jetsam. All of this happened in the summer of 1995. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis introduced the bagpipes while performing live (however many people there did not like this).

Korn began touring in Europe during September 1995. One of the band&#x27;s first concert dates was in Nottingham. After the performance, there was a conflict between Arvizu and the drum technician, resulting in the airport prohibiting them from boarding the plane. Korn made their London debut on October 27, 1995, performing at LA2 with Paw as the opening act. At the end of that same month, the band also made their Paris debut playing in a small club, L&#x27;Arapaho. Korn received positive praise from the European press because of their &quot;ravaging&quot; live performances. By October 1995, Korn had played 200–250 dates in support of their first album. From 1995 to 1996, Korn toured with Sugar Ray, Cradle of Thorns, Life of Agony, and others. Korn and Deftones opened for Ozzy Osbourne in early 1996.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

Mike Boem of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found that if one accepts the style of &quot;thrashing, metallic, incessantly wrathful rock...the debut is a smashing success.&quot; while finding that the music may be cathartic for listeners who can identify with Davis&#x27;s lyrics, the music itself had &quot;no sensible measure of its artistic merit.&quot; Boem compared some of the musical tracks as containing elements of scarping jagged guitars similar to that of the Nine Inch Nails album &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; but concluded that &quot;as the album goes on, Korn&#x27;s blasting and hammering becomes more head-on, the results less distinctive.&quot; In his 1995 review, Jason Arnopp of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; wrote that Davis&#x27; &quot;voice overflows with cracked, frustrated emotion, often lapsing into uncontrollable screams like a mental ward&quot;. He described how Korn have &quot;injected their own special insanity into the music, crafting a horribly sleazy sound that matches their bleak outlook on life&quot;. He noted that the &quot;general aggression&quot; of the album could delight fans of Prong, Pantera, and Rage Against the Machine. Arnopp rated &quot;Korn&quot; 4 out of 5 and mentioned the &quot;band&#x27;s cult stature&quot; a year after the album&#x27;s release. In 1996, music journalist Manuel Rabasse described &quot;Korn&quot; as &quot;an almost dadaist record – little or no melody, structures cut out in spite of common sense, guitars deliberately out of tune – with, to top it all off, a hysterical vocalist playing the bagpipes&quot; and said Korn was &quot;a group of crazies&quot;. Rabasse found the album &quot;marks the awakening of a metal-hardcore a little too primal&quot;.

===Retrospective===

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave &quot;Korn&quot; a positive review, calling the album &quot;a powerful sound and one that actually builds on the funk-metal innovations of the late &#x27;80s/early &#x27;90s instead of merely replicating them&quot;. In a 2002 critical reappraisal, Catherine Yates of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; gave the album 5 out of 5 rating. She compared it against &quot;the continuing glut of interchangeable metal drones who have appropriated their blueprint for quick sell, lowest common denominator, and it still stands as a monument – unchallenged and unequaled – to the authentic ideals that spawned it&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; writers wrote that they considered the album to be Korn&#x27;s best, writing, &quot;this is a record that remains as integral to modern metal as the first Black Sabbath album or Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;&quot;. Sputnikmusic thought that although Davis isn&#x27;t the best lyricist, he is able to paint very disturbing visual images in the head of the listener, especially on the song &quot;Daddy&quot;. Sputnikmusic also thought that Davis&#x27;s voice was what made Korn unique, and that it made every song on the album interesting. They praised each of the members&#x27; skill on their respective instrument, and summed it up as &quot;a bass heavy, angst ridden vessel of catharsis&quot;. They considered &quot;Blind&quot;, &quot;Ball Tongue&quot;, &quot;Need To&quot;, &quot;Faget&quot;, &quot;Helmet in the Bush&quot; and &quot;Daddy&quot; to be the best songs from the album. Arnopp stated that the group &quot;positively encouraged America&#x27;s formerly introverted, apathetic misfits to thrust a livid middle finger in the face of high–school jocks who would traditionally bundle them into a locker and brand them &#x27;faggots&#x27; for sporting hair longer than any Army buzz-cut.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
On January 29, 1996, &quot;Korn&quot; went gold in the United States, and on February 10, 1996, the album charted at number 72. The album spent 30 weeks on the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand charts, entering on June 23, 1996, and peaking at number 10. The album left the chart on May 18, 1997. It went platinum in the United States on January 8, 1997, and entered the ARIA Charts on March 28, 1999, at number 49. It maintained a position on the chart for five weeks, and peaked at number 46. It peaked at number five on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart on April 24, 1999. On July 17, 1999, it entered the MegaCharts at its peak position of 56. After three weeks, &quot;Korn&quot; left the chart. On November 10, 1999, it was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album peaked at number 181 on the UK Albums Chart on February 10, 2001. It has been certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. In 2003, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that &quot;Korn&quot; sold at least 2,100,000 copies in the United States.

==Legacy and influence==
Korn&#x27;s debut album is said to have established nu metal. As said by Joel McIver, &quot;Korn&quot; &quot;was almost solely responsible for the tidal wave of change that subsequently swept the metal scene.&quot; Bands like Coal Chamber and Limp Bizkit were inspired by the album&#x27;s &quot;churning rage, emphasising similar grooves and song structures&quot;, and &quot;the sound&#x27;s hip-hop elements&quot;. Slipknot, Machine Head, and Sepultura were also inspired by the album. The album launched the career of record producer Ross Robinson, who later produced albums such as Sepultura&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Roots&quot;, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s 1997 debut album &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot;, and Slipknot&#x27;s first two albums (their 1999 self-titled debut and 2001&#x27;s &quot;Iowa&quot;).

In 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;Korn&quot; as &quot;the most important metal record of the last 20 years.&quot; In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Korn&quot; at number 27 in their &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list. In 2018, &quot;Loudwire&quot; named it the greatest nu metal album of all time. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the album at No. 30 on its list of the 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.

Catherine Yates of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; compared the album&#x27;s impact to that of Nirvana, stating that Nirvana &quot;provided the soundtrack to the trials of disaffected youth&quot;, while Korn&#x27;s debut album &quot;was the manifestation of disaffected youth itself&quot;, summarizing that &quot;&quot;Korn&quot; itself was the forebear of a musical movement&quot;. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; highlighted &quot;Korn&quot;″s influence as having spawned &quot;A parade of copycats and bandwagon-hoppers who took the album&#x27;s sound and remodelled it without an ounce of innovation that Korn possessed&quot;.

<doc id="226705" wikidata="Q5977899" url="?curid=226705" title="Stars in Their Eyes">
<text>Stars in Their Eyes is a British television talent series, based on Joop van den Ende&#x27;s Dutch format &quot;Soundmixshow&quot;. It featured a singing contest in which members of the public impersonate showbiz stars.

The show premiered on 21 July 1990 and initially ran until 23 December 2006. It was produced by Granada for ITV and originally presented by Leslie Crowther. Matthew Kelly took over in May 1993, before he was replaced by Cat Deeley in April 2004. An Elvis Presley special hosted by Russ Abbot aired in January 1993, as well as 2003 specials hosted by Davina McCall. A number of celebrity specials and a children&#x27;s spin-off series were also aired during the original run.

A six-part revival hosted by Harry Hill aired from 10 January 2015 to 14 February 2015, but it was later axed by ITV due to low ratings and poor reviews. In 2022, the format was revived as &quot;Starstruck&quot;.

==History==
A series of non-televised pilots were filmed in 1989 hosted by Chris Tarrant. However, in February 1990, Leslie Crowther was chosen as the host of the show which began airing on 21 July 1990. Crowther hosted the first three series, and a Christmas Special in 1991. At the time of his car accident in October 1992, he was booked to record an Elvis Presley special (which was later hosted by Russ Abbot) and a fourth series (later hosted by Matthew Kelly) in 1993.

It then became clear that Crowther would not be able to return. He announced his retirement from showbusiness in November 1994 and died 2 years later. Therefore, Kelly hosted the show until the live grand final of the 15th series on 13 March 2004. Kelly announced a few days earlier that he would quit the show in order to pursue his acting career full-time. Kelly also hosted the 2001 pilot episode, and first series of the kids version in 2002.

In January 2003, Kelly was arrested by police over allegations of child sex abuse resulting in Davina McCall temporarily guest hosting the show for three celebrity specials that were broadcast the following month. Kelly returned after the charges were dropped.

Cat Deeley, who previously took over as host of the kids&#x27; version in 2003, was Kelly&#x27;s replacement for the final adult series in 2005. Deeley also hosted several celebrity specials in 2004. In June 2006, ITV denied reports that the series was facing the axe although admitted that the future of the show was being discussed. Deeley hosted the show until its final episode in December 2006; the show was then axed by ITV.

The most impersonated stars are Dolly Parton, Elvis Presley, Cher, George Michael, Celine Dion, Kylie Minogue and Madonna.

===2015 revival===
Harry Hill took over as host on 10 January 2015, with all episodes pre-recorded and the winner of each show again voted for by the studio audience.

The revival proved divisive – fans of the original format were critical of it, saying that Harry Hill had made the show about him rather than the contestants; while others acknowledged that the revival was a post-modern parody of the original, with its knowing ridicule of talent show cliches such as terrible performances being overpraised, and the actions of the presenter receiving high editorial focus to distract from the outdated performance element being thinly stretched. Each episode features Harry being pursued by Adele (really a look-alike) for being in possession of her baby and she would comically chase him until she got the baby back.

In April 2015, it was announced that due to poor viewing figures, ITV would not be renewing the show for another series, and it was axed.

===2022 return as &quot;Starstruck&quot;===
==Format==
&quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; is a talent show where contestants get the chance to appear and sing live as a famous singer. The show is most importantly a &#x27;soundalike&#x27; show, but they are also dressed up to look as close as possible to the singer they are impersonating, often with wigs and heavy makeup. Each contestant would walk through &#x27;smoky&#x27; doors before instantly reappearing dressed up as their chosen star.

===Heats===
The contestants appear firstly as themselves, talking briefly to the host about their lives and giving clues as to who they are going to be performing as, finishing with the now famous catchphrase &#x27;Tonight [presenter name] I&#x27;m going to be...&#x27; The contestants then disappear through the equally famous doors and reappear as the famous singer they are going to impersonate, seemingly instantly.

At the end of the show, the studio audience vote for their favourite, and the winner is announced. The winners from each show in the series return for the grand final to perform once more.

===Grand Final &amp; Live Grand Final===

====1990–1992, 2015====
In the original Leslie Crowther version and 2015 revival, the grand finals were pre-recorded, and the winner of the whole series was voted for by the studio audience at the end of the show. The first series final in 1990 also had a celebrity panel, consisting of Joe Longthorne, Sally Dynevor and Pete Waterman, who gave their opinions after each performance.

====1993–2006====
When Matthew Kelly took over, the grand finals were broadcast live, and the winner of the whole series was voted for by the viewing public through the phone lines and in later years online as well. The winner was announced later that same evening in a separate broadcast.

The same process applied during Cat Deeley&#x27;s tenure as host.

<doc id="226711" wikidata="Q1782544" url="?curid=226711" title="The Call of the Simpsons">
<text>&quot;The Call of the Simpsons&quot; is the seventh episode of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on February 18, 1990. It was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wesley Archer. Albert Brooks made his first of ten guest appearances on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; franchise in this episode as the voice of Cowboy Bob.

In this episode, Homer purchases an RV and the Simpsons vacation in the wilderness. After the RV accidentally plummets from a cliff, the Simpsons find themselves stranded in a forest. While Bart and Homer try hiking back to civilization, Homer gets covered in mud and is mistaken for Bigfoot by a naturalist. News of the Bigfoot encounter spreads quickly and soon hunters converge to capture Homer. Meanwhile, Maggie is separated from her family and cared for by bears.

==Plot==
Jealous of Ned Flanders&#x27; new motor home, Homer visits Bob&#x27;s RV Round-up to buy one. Because of his poor credit rating, he only qualifies for a smaller, dilapidated RV, which he is conned into purchasing. Homer takes his family on an excursion, driving on remote backroads. After Homer ignores Marge&#x27;s suggestion to drive back to the main road, the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice. They escape the RV before it plummets over the cliff and explodes, leaving them stranded in the wilderness with no food or supplies.

After Homer builds a crude lean-to shelter, he and Bart leave to find help, unaware that Maggie is tagging along. Marge and Lisa stay behind and build a fire and sturdier shelter despite knowing nothing about camping. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is adopted by a family of bears. Homer and Bart lose their clothes after plunging over a waterfall and falling into a raging river. They hide their exposed bodies with leaves and mud. After a frigid night&#x27;s sleep, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive. When the bees attack him, he evades them by jumping into a mud pit. Homer is mistaken for Bigfoot after a nature photographer takes a picture of him covered in mud. Soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts after a tabloid offers a $5,000 reward for capturing the creature alive.

After Marge and Lisa are rescued by park rangers, Marge tells the media the monster in question is her husband, leading to tabloid headlines such as &quot;I married Bigfoot&quot;. Cold, hungry, and exhausted, Homer and Bart stumble upon the bears&#x27; cave and retrieve Maggie. Homer is captured and taken to a lab for testing. He returns home after scientists agree that he is &quot;either a below-average human being or a brilliant beast&quot;. While watching news coverage of his ordeal, Homer worries his co-workers will mock him until Marge consoles him by calling him &quot;my brilliant beast.&quot;

==Production==
The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wesley Archer. A plot twist that involved Homer being carried away to an eagle nest and being raised as a baby eagle was suggested for this episode by executive producer James L. Brooks, but they ended up going with Maggie being raised by bears instead. The sequence with Marge and Lisa by the bonfire was originally longer and included a conversation between the two about boys, but it was cut from the episode. In the original script, Homer and Bart were not talking in the scene where they concealed their private parts with mud and moss, but Sam Simon thought it would be &quot;too funny to leave as a stage direction&quot; and they added dialogue to the scene.

Albert Brooks guest starred in the episode as the voice of Cowboy Bob. He was not sure whether he wanted to be identified with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. The episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on Fox at the time it was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast on February 18, 1990, &quot;The Call of the Simpsons&quot; finished third that day, with a Nielsen rating of 14.6 and a 22 percent audience share. The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1990 in the category &quot;Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special&quot;. IGN named Albert Brooks&#x27; guest performance in this episode, along with his four other appearances on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the best guest appearance in the show&#x27;s history.

&quot;The Call of the Simpsons&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, both criticized and praised the episode saying: &quot;This episode is a bit less than the sum of its parts. The early stuff at the RV Round-Up is much better than the main camping story, although there&#x27;s some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears?&quot; In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated the episode a (of 5), adding &quot;the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very different today, if done at all.&quot;

Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode &quot;a perfect example of the first season&#x27;s bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly-drawn neuroses&quot; and said &quot;it was this combination that made Groening&#x27;s shorts for the Ullman show so compelling, and ultimately what made it possible for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to break the molds of network television&quot;. Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that &quot;while [the episode] doesn&#x27;t offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons, it&#x27;s a generally solid show&quot; and added that &quot;the episode uses a wackier tone than usual for this era, but it works, and the program is consistently fun&quot;.

<text>Surat (Gujarati: ) is a city in the western Indian state of Gujarat. The word Surat directly translates to &quot;face&quot; in Urdu, Gujarati and Hindi. Located on the banks of the river Tapti near its confluence with the Arabian Sea, it used to be a large seaport. It is now the commercial and economic centre of South Gujarat, and one of the largest urban areas of western India. It has well-established diamond and textile industry, and is a major supply centre for apparels and accessories. About 90% of the world&#x27;s diamonds are cut and polished in Surat. It is the second largest city in Gujarat after Ahmedabad and the eighth largest city by population and ninth largest urban agglomeration in India. It is the administrative capital of the Surat district.

The city is located south of the state capital, Gandhinagar; south of Ahmedabad; and north of Mumbai. The city centre is located on the Tapti River (popularly known as Tapi), close to the Arabian Sea.

Surat will be the world&#x27;s fastest-growing city from 2019 to 2035, according to a study conducted by Economic Times. The city registered an annualised GDP growth rate of 11.5% over the seven fiscal years between 2001 and 2008. Surat was awarded &quot;best city&quot; by the Annual Survey of India&#x27;s City-Systems (ASICS) in 2013. Surat has been selected as the first smart IT city in India which is being constituted by the Microsoft CityNext Initiative tied up with IT services majors Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro. The city has 2.97 million internet users, about 65% of total population. Surat was selected in 2015 for an IBM Smarter Cities Challenge grant. Surat has been selected as one of twenty Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi&#x27;s flagship Smart Cities Mission. Surat is also home to the world&#x27;s largest office building by floor area, the Surat Diamond Bourse.

Surat is listed as the second cleanest city of India as of 21 August 2020 according to the Swachh Survekshan 2020 on 20 August. It suffered a major pipeline fire which caused some damage. In the 2021 edition of the same survey, it slipped to 12th place and further dropped to 25th in 2023. Despite these recent fluctuations, Surat continues to implement various cleanliness initiatives and shared the title of the cleanest city in India with Indore in the 2023 Swachh Survekshan Awards, highlighting its ongoing efforts towards maintaining high cleanliness standards.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The traditional account is that Surat was built up by a wealthy Hindu merchant named Gopi around the year 1500. At first, the town had no name and was simply called &quot;the new place&quot;. Gopi consulted with astrologers, who suggested the name &quot;Suraj&quot;, or &quot;Suryapur&quot;, or &quot;city of the sun&quot;. Gopi sent a request to the unnamed king of Gujarat for this to be the new town&#x27;s name. The Muslim king altered it to &quot;Surat&quot; after the word &quot;surah&quot;, which is the name of the chapters of the Qur&#x27;an. However, the names Suryapur and Surat are both mentioned in sources before 1500, so both the name and the town predate Gopi&#x27;s time.

Duarte Barbosa described Surat as Suratt. Jacob Peeters referred to Surat as Sourratte which is a Dutch name. There are many other names of Surat in history. Surat is referred to as Surrat, Surate or Soorat in some literature.


===Surat before the Mughal Empire===
Before the rise of Surat in the 1500s, the nearby town of Rander was the main commercial centre in the area. Rander had a prominent Arab merchant community involved in overseas trade with regions such as Burma, China, Malaya, and Sumatra. In the 1500s, Rander declined due to Portuguese raids. Surat became an important port city around the same time, and some of Rander&#x27;s merchant population likely moved to Surat for economic opportunity.

Early references to Surat appear by the 10th century, but they shed little light on what type of settlement it was. As Suryapur, it is mentioned along with Bharuch as a place where an army from Anhilwara passed through in 990 en route to attack the ruler of Lata. Suryapur may also be the port called &quot;Surabaya&quot; mentioned by the 10th-century Arabic geographer Istakhri as being four days south of Khambhat and five days north of Sanjan. Other Arabic authors spelled the name as &quot;Subara&quot; or &quot;Sufara&quot;. The identification of this place with Surat, though, is uncertain, and in any case these early mentions of Suryapur or Surabaya do not indicate whether it was a sizeable town or just a small hamlet.

Another early mention of Surat is in the 1190s, after Qutb ud-Din Aibak, then a general of Muhammad Ghuri, defeated the Chaulukya king Bhima II in battle. According to the local histories of Bakshi Mian Walad Shah Ahmad and Munshi Ghulam Mohi ud-Din, Aibak went as far south as Rander and Surat. Surat was then ruled by a Hindu chief based at nearby Kamrej. This ruler initially tried to take refuge in a garden at Surat, but then decided that he had no chance of resisting Aibak&#x27;s forces and offered his submission. Aibak, in turn, confirmed him as ruler of Kamrej.

From 1297, Gujarat was gradually conquered by Allauddin Khilji, the ruler of the principal state in north India at the time, the Delhi Sultanate. The Delhi Sultanate appointed Governors to control Gujarat, but this had to be forcefully imposed, notably in 1347, when Muhammad bin Tughluq sacked Surat, among other cities. Firoz Shah Tughlaq later built a fort at Surat in 1373. According to Bakshi Mian&#x27;s account, when Zafar Khan was appointed governor of Gujarat in 1391, he appointed his son Masti Khan to govern Rander and Surat, but Bakshi Mian adds that Surat was not very populous at this point.

As control from the Delhi Sultanate waned at the end of the 14th century, pressure grew for an independent Gujarat, culminating in Zafar Khan declaring independence in 1407. Surat was controlled directly by the nobles of the Rajput kingdom of Baglana who fell either under the Gujarat Sultans or the Deccan sultanates. However, following the fall of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1538 it was controlled by more local nobles starting with Chengiz Khan who enjoyed absolute authority over Surat, Broach, Baroda and Champaner. However, in 1637, Aurangzeb fully annexed Baglana into the Mughal Empire.

In 1514, the Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa described Surat as an important seaport, frequented by many ships from Malabar and various parts of the world. By 1520, the name of the city had become Surat. It was burned by the Portuguese (1512 and 1530), conquered by the Mughals (1573) and was twice raided by the Maratha king Shivaji (17th century). Mughal Emperor Akbar placed major importance on Gujarat and successfully obtained numerous towns in Gujarat. The Mughals were able to conquer Surat due to his campaigns against Gujarat during his rule. In the 1570s, he launched two major campaigns against Gujarat—one of a much longer duration and one much shorter. The fall of Surat occurred during the former campaign and lasted one month and seventeen days. Akbar implemented large military power during these conquests, fighting many battles. Notably, the conquest of Surat was an important catalyst for overseas trade during the rule of the Mughal Empire as it became the most important port city of that reign and evolved into a bustling trading hub.

===During the Mughal Empire===
It was the most prosperous port in the Mughal empire. Despite being a rich city, Surat looked like a typical &quot;grubby&quot; trader&#x27;s town with mud-and-bamboo tenements and crooked streets, although along the riverfront there were a few mansions and warehouses belonging to local merchant princes and the establishments of Turkish, Armenian, English, French and Dutch traders. There were also hospitals for cows, horses, flies and insects run by religious Jains, which puzzled travelers. Some streets were narrow while others were of sufficient width. In the evening, especially near the Bazaar (marketplace), the streets became crowded with people and merchants (including Banyan merchants) selling their goods. Surat was a populous city during the Mughal era but also had a large transient population: during the monsoon season, when ships could come and go from the ports without danger, the city&#x27;s population would swell. In 1612, England established its first Indian trading factory in Surat. The city was looted twice by the Maratha king Shivaji, with the first sacking occurring in 1664. Shivaji&#x27;s raids scared trade away and caused ruin to the city.

Later, Surat became the emporium of India, exporting gold and cloth. Its major industries were shipbuilding and textile manufacture. The coast of the Tapti River, from Athwalines to Dumas, was specially meant for shipbuilders, who were usually Rassis. The city continued to be prosperous until the rise of Bombay (present-day Mumbai). Afterward, Surat&#x27;s shipbuilding industry declined and Surat itself gradually declined throughout the 18th century. During 1790–1791, an epidemic killed 100,000 Gujaratis in Surat. The British and Dutch both claimed control of the city, but in 1800, the British took control of Surat. A fire in 1837 resulted in more than 500 deaths and the destruction of much of the city.

By the middle of the 19th century, Surat had become a stagnant city with about 80,000 inhabitants. When India&#x27;s railways opened, the city started becoming prosperous again. Silks, cotton, brocades, and objects of gold and silver from Surat became famous and the ancient art of manufacturing fine muslin was revived.

=== Surat under British Raj ===
Under British Raj, Surat saw a period of decline from its success under the Mughal Empire. Though it remained a pivotal city for textile-based products, it was less important to the British as a port city than it was for the Mughals. Nevertheless, Surat was very interconnected with Asia and Europe, involving trade with both Europeans and Armenian merchants.

Tactically, Surat involved itself in trade in fields that did not compete with existing European products, such as pearls and silver. The textile industry was also a large portion of Surat’s shipping success. But despite being a primary port for textiles, Surat rarely manufactured these textiles locally. Bullion was also quite important to Surat’s economy during this time. During his first-hand experience on a trip to Surat, Britisher John Ovington recalls the great ores Surat possessed, such as gold and silver. He recollects the notable “abundance of Pearls” and other precious stones like diamonds that could “be purchas’d here [Surat] at very reasonable rates.” As Ovington observed, this industry was imperative to Surat’s prosperity under the British Raj and allowed it to maintain its relevance as a port city.

During the Quit India Movement of Mahatma Gandhi in 1942, A large number of 3,000 Koli cultivators from Matwad, Karadi, Machhad and Kothmadi in Surat District fought against British soldiers at Matwad with lathis and dharias on 21 August 1942. In this fight, four persons including one policeman died. The kolis also snatched away four police muskets and two bayonets. Kolis smashed up the Jalalpore Railway Station, removed the Rails and burnt down the post office. After this, situation in the neighbouring villages of Borsad, Anand and Thasra taluqas became so aggravated that British troops was marched through the villages between 22 and 24 August 1942.

=== Armenians in Surat ===
The Armenian community in Surat, India, flourished from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving a lasting impact on the city&#x27;s history. The Armenian gravestones in Surat, dating back to this period, are intricate and well-preserved, showcasing the community&#x27;s presence and customs.

Armenians in Surat were renowned traders, dealing in jewelry, precious stones, cotton, and silk. They established trade routes to destinations such as Egypt, the Levant, Turkey, Venice, and Leghorn, often traveling with their families.

The British recognised the Armenians&#x27; business prowess, seeking their cooperation for trading privileges in the Mughal court. Today, these gravestones serve as a poignant reminder of the Armenian community&#x27;s significant contributions to Surat&#x27;s history and culture.

=== Modern period ===

==== Post Independence ====
After India gained independence on 15 August 1947, Surat became part of India. At that time it was a part of Bombay State. Later it became the part of Gujarat state. Along with Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Nagpur and Vadodara, Surat became one of the fast growing cities and major commercial and industrial centers of Western India. During the post-independence period, Surat has experienced considerable growth in industrial activities especially textiles and chemical along with trading activities.

==== 1994 Plague ====
Surat faced a major health crisis in 1994. News of a plague outbreak in Surat occurred in September 1994, and when the possibility of quarantine for the city was mentioned, many residents of Surat fled the city.

About a quarter of Surat’s population fled the city, including people who were in the incubation phase of the disease. This, in turn, partly contributed to the spread of the plague throughout India.

In the media, the cause of the plague was attributed to poor garbage disposal. However, the spread was instead brought about by rodents and fleas which were inadvertently caused by garbage in Surat. The disease ran more rampant through the slum population of Surat. In order to combat the spread of this disease, Surat closed its schools, universities, and public places for an indefinite period. They also ordered the shutdown of important industrial businesses, including diamond-cutting units. Eventually, antibiotics were given out and the plague was controlled.
Prior to the major plague outbreak, Surat Municipal Corporation was suspended in 1993, leaving no major elected body in charge. During the plague, Suryadevara Ramachandra Rao was elected as the new administrator and launched extensive cleaning campaigns to combat the outbreak.

This was a major step towards sanitation and cleanliness in Surat. Rao’s campaigns included launching hotel and shop inspections (to address their irresponsible garbage practices) for several months and calling for the broadening of roads. He enforced designated sweeping of the city as well as the regular collection of garbage. Rao also demolished many illegal constructions. However, slums would often fall subject to removal when streets were widened, but Rao ensured that the residents were given alternative residential sites with adequate facilities to accommodate them. Rao’s urban and sanitary-related actions fostered the revival of Surat in its post-plague state.

Nevertheless, the plague had long-lasting implications for Surat. It brought attention to the lack of information and the spread of misinformation that occurred in India. Incorrect death tolls and false facts about the cause of the disease were spread, leaving lots of room for post-plague city revival both in terms of information control and cleanliness. Surat’s actions pertaining to the latter eventually resulted in the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage deeming Surat as the second cleanest city in India.

==== Present Day Surat ====
On 2 October 2007, Surat district was split into two by the creation of a new Tapi district, under the Surat District Re-organisation Act 2007.

Since the 20th century, Surat has experienced some 20 floods. In 1968, most parts of the city were flooded and in 1994 a flood caused a country-wide plague outbreak, Surat being the epicenter. In 1998, 30 per cent of Surat had gone under water due to flooding in Tapti river following release of water from Ukai dam located 90 km from Surat and in Aug 2006 flood more than 95 per cent of the city was under Tapti river waters, killing more than 120 people, stranding tens of thousands in their homes without food or electricity and closing businesses and schools for weeks. The city is expected to experience more flooding and extreme weather as climate change becomes worse, so has invested in flood protection and climate resilience infrastructure.

== Economy ==
Surat ranked 9th in India with a GDP of $40 billion in the fiscal year 2016. The GDP of Surat in 2020 will be around $57 billion estimated by The City Mayors Foundation, an international think tank on urban affairs. Surat is a major hub of diamond cutting and polishing. The first diamond workshops in Gujarat appeared in Surat and Navasari in the late 1950s. The major group working in this industry is people from the Saurashtra region of Gujarat. Because of demand in the American market from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s (with only a brief recession in 1979), Surat&#x27;s diamond industry grew tremendously. Currently, most of the diamond polishing workshops are running in the Varachha area of Surat, mostly by the people of the Patel community. Around the world, 8 out of 10 diamonds on the market were cut and polished in Surat. This industry earns India about US$10 billion in annual exports. That declined by about 18% in 2019 due to reduced demand for diamonds. The decline continued in 2020 when the industry closed for some months because of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. A legacy of old Dutch trade links, it began after a Surti entrepreneur returned from East Africa bringing diamond cutters. The rough diamonds are mined in South Africa and other regions of the African continent, and go from here as smooth gems to Antwerp, Belgium where the international diamond trade is run mainly by Hasidic Jews and Jains from Palanpur in North Gujarat. Surat&#x27;s economy drives from a range of manufacturing and industry fields such as diamonds, textiles, petrochemicals, shipbuilding, automobile, port etc.
Since it is known for producing textiles, including silk, Surat is known as the textile hub of the nation or the Silk City of India. It is very famous for its cotton mills and Surat Zari Craft. Surat is the biggest center of MMF (man-made fiber) in India. It has a total of 381 dyeing and printing mills and 41,100 power loom units. There are over a hundred thousand units and mills in total. The overall annual turnover is around 5 billion rupees. There are over 800 cloth wholesalers in Surat. It is the largest manufacturer of clothes in India, and Surti dress material can be found in any state of India. Surat produces 9 million meters of fabric annually, which accounts for 60% of the total polyester cloth production in India. Now the city is focusing on increasing the exports of its textile.

There are many SME Domestic IT Companies present in Surat. MNC IT companies like IBM, HCL have satellite or virtual branches in Surat. On 14 February 2014, Government of Gujarat DST had handover STPI Surat at Bhestan-Jiav Road, Bhestan Near Udhana-Sachin BRTS Route. Surat city administration will demand for setting up of an information technology (IT) hub and an Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) on the outskirts of the city. Microsoft CityNext initiative has tied up with IT services majors Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro to leverage technology for sustainable growth of cities in India. The first smart IT city in India is being constituted by the Microsoft CityNext Initiative in Surat, Gujarat. In 2011, Surat hosted India&#x27;s first Microsoft DreamSpark Yatra (a tech event) with speakers from Microsoft Headquarters at Redmond, Washington. The event was organised by Ex-Microsoft Student Partner Samarth Zankharia. In May 2015, Tech giant IBM has chosen Surat among 16 global locations for its smart cities program to help them address challenges like waste management, disaster management and citizen services. Under the program, IBM will send a team of experts to each of the chosen cities where they will spend three weeks working closely with city staff analysing data about critical issues faced by its local bodies; the co-operation continued into 2016.

Surat is being a port city, it has turned as a major commercial and industrial hub in India. It is home for many companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Reliance Industries (Hazira Manufacturing Division), Essar Steel, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Krishak Bharati Cooperative, NTPC Limited, Bharat Petroleum, Indian Oil Corporation, UltraTech Cement, Shell, GAIL, GSEG, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation, Hero MotoCorp etc. Hazira Port is located in Hazira, an industrial suburb where most of the industries are located while other region is Magdalla which is also developed as Port of Magdalla.

The government of Gujarat plans another project near Surat similar to Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT). The Chief Minister has suggested that the government wishes to develop DREAM to have a five-seven star hotel, bank, IT, corporate trading house, entertainment zone and other facilities while the Surat Diamond Bourse (SDB) will be based there. Allotment of Khajod land for the project is convenient for the state government because they have of available land. The Trade Centre, located near Sarsana village, will have a pillar-less air-conditioned hall with a pillar-less dome.
