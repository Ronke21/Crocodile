<text>John &quot;Jack&quot; Gilbert Graham (January 23, 1932 – January 11, 1957) was an American mass murderer who, on November 1, 1955, killed 44 people aboard United Airlines Flight 629 near Longmont, Colorado, using a dynamite time bomb. Graham planted the bomb in his mother&#x27;s suitcase in an apparent move to murder her and claim $37,500 () worth of life insurance money from policies he purchased in the airport terminal just before the flight departure. Graham was convicted of murdering his mother. He was sentenced to death and was executed by the state of Colorado in January 1957.

== Background ==
John Gilbert Graham was born on January 23, 1932, in Denver, Colorado, the child of Daisie (née Walker) Graham and her second husband, William Graham. Nicknamed &quot;Jack,&quot; Graham was Daisie&#x27;s second child, as she already had a daughter from her first marriage. Graham was born during the height of the Great Depression, and, in 1937, his father died from pneumonia, causing Daisie to send the young Jack to an orphanage due to their poverty. In 1941, Daisie was married for the third time to Earl King, who died shortly after their marriage. Using her inheritance from King&#x27;s death, Daisie became a successful businesswoman, but despite her newfound wealth, Daisie did not collect Graham from the orphanage. The two remained estranged until 1954, when Graham was 22 years old, and Daisie King was running a successful restaurant. After their reunion, King and Graham had a poor relationship, and often argued.

In 1955, shortly before the aircraft bombing, King&#x27;s restaurant was destroyed in a suspicious gas explosion, believed to have been deliberately caused by Graham. Graham had insured the restaurant and collected on the property insurance following the explosion.

Graham married Gloria A. Elson, with whom he had two children, Allen and Suzanne, who were infants at the time of the notable events. After Graham&#x27;s execution, Gloria and the two children began using her maiden name. Allen Earl Elson married Denise Marie in 1976. Both went missing on October 16, 1981, in Curry County, Oregon, and are presumed dead. Gloria died in 1992.

== Bombing ==
United Airlines Flight 629 was using a Douglas DC-6B airliner (named &quot;Mainliner Denver&quot;) piloted by World War II veteran Lee Hall on the evening of November 1, 1955. The flight had originated at New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport, making a stop in Chicago before continuing to Denver; it then took off from Denver, Colorado&#x27;s Stapleton Airfield, bound for Portland, Oregon, with continuing service to Seattle. Minutes after the plane&#x27;s departure from Denver, the DC-6B exploded, the flaming wreckage falling into farmland near Longmont, Colorado. There were no survivors.

Graham&#x27;s mother had been a passenger on Flight 629, and was traveling to Alaska to visit her daughter, Graham&#x27;s half-sister. At the time, flight insurance could be routinely purchased in vending machines at airports, until changes to the system in the 1980s.

Graham&#x27;s apparent motive for the bombing was to claim $37,500 () worth of life insurance money from policies he had purchased in the airport terminal just moments before the aircraft&#x27;s departure.

== Arrest and conviction ==
Investigators discovered that Graham had a criminal record for embezzlement by check forgery, and illegal transport of whiskey for which he had served 60 days in a Texas prison. King&#x27;s restaurant had been severely damaged by &quot;a suspicious explosion&quot; earlier that year, and Graham had received the insurance settlement. Local people also suspected Graham of deliberately causing his new pick-up truck to be struck by a train that year, in order to collect the insurance.

After reassembling fragments of the plane, the FBI determined that certain items of luggage in the baggage compartment had contained explosives. Based on that evidence, as well as his contradictory statements, physical evidence found at Graham&#x27;s house, and finally a confession, Graham was charged with sabotage, then later murder.
After Graham&#x27;s arrest, Denver radio station KDEN owner Gene Amole and &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; photographer Morey Engle surreptitiously took a camera into the jail for an interview of Graham during a reunion with his wife Gloria. &quot;I loved my mother very much&quot;, Graham told Amole. &quot;She meant a lot to me. It&#x27;s very hard for me to tell exactly how I feel. She left so much of herself behind.&quot; When Amole asked him why he confessed, he said the FBI had threatened to point out inconsistencies in statements made by his wife Gloria. &quot;I was not about to let them touch her in any way, shape or form,&quot; he said. None of the Denver TV stations would agree to broadcast the film at the time, though it was eventually shown on one of Denver&#x27;s local PBS stations as part of a documentary.

Graham&#x27;s confessions gave details about the bomb that matched the evidence from the plane&#x27;s wreckage. He also told prison doctors that he &quot;realized that there were about 50 or 60 people carried on a DC6, but the number of people to be killed made no difference to me; it could have been a thousand. When their time comes, there is nothing they can do about it.&quot;

Graham&#x27;s trial led to Colorado becoming the first state to officially sanction the broadcast of criminal trials on television. No federal statute at the time made it a crime to blow up an airplane. Therefore, on the day after Graham&#x27;s confession, the Colorado district attorney moved to prosecute Graham via the simplest possible route: premeditated murder of a single victim, his mother, Daisie King. Graham recanted his confession, but at his 1956 trial his defense was unable to counter the massive amount of evidence presented by the prosecution. In February 1956, he attempted suicide in his cell, and was thereafter put under 24-hour surveillance. On May 5, 1956, Graham was convicted of the murder of his mother, Daisie King, and was sentenced to death.

Graham was executed in the Colorado State Penitentiary gas chamber on January 11, 1957. One source has his final words being &quot;Thanks, Warden&quot;, after Warden Tinsley patted him on the shoulder. TIME magazine quoted a lengthier statement, &quot;As far as feeling remorse for those people, I don&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t help it. Everybody pays their way and takes their chances. That&#x27;s just the way it goes.&quot;

== Fictional portrayals ==
* Graham was portrayed by Nick Adams in the 1959 motion picture &quot;The FBI Story&quot; starring James Stewart and Vera Miles.
* The case was the basis for the 1960 &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; episode of &quot;M Squad&quot;.
* The case was the basis for the 1959 &quot;Flight 169--Mass Murder&quot; episode of &quot;Deadline (1959 TV series)&quot;.
* The book &quot;Mainliner Denver: The Bombing of Flight 629&quot; by Andrew J. Field (Johnson Books, 2005) was published on the 50th anniversary of the bombing.
* The case is the subject of the episode titled &quot;Time Bomb&quot; of the 2013 Investigation Discovery miniseries &quot;A Crime to Remember&quot;.

== Music ==
Macabre, a grindcore metal band from Chicago, wrote a song about Graham called &quot;There Was a Young Man Who Blew Up a Plane&quot;, on their &quot;Sinister Slaughter&quot; album.

<text>Viljandi County ( or &quot;Viljandimaa&quot;; ) is one of 15 counties of Estonia. It is located in southern Estonia bordering Pärnu, Järva, Jõgeva, Tartu and Valga counties as well as Latvia.

== History ==
Viljandimaa, under the German name of &quot;Kreis Fellin&quot;, was an important centre of commerce and power in the Middle Ages. Today, there are numerous castle ruins there dating from that time.

Soomaa National Park is a national park located partially within Viljandi County, Estonia. Soomaa (&quot;land of bogs&quot;) protects 390 km2, and is a Ramsar site of protected wetlands. The park was created in 1993.

== County government ==
The Viljandi County government () had been led by the Governor (), who used to be appointed by the Government of Estonia for a term of five years. Jüri Ratas&#x27;s first cabinet decided to abolish the institution, which went into effect in 2018. Lembit Kruuse was the final Governor to serve the role.

== Municipalities ==
The county is subdivided into municipalities. There is one urban municipality ( – towns) and three rural municipalities ( – parishes) in Viljandi County.
== Religion ==

The largest number of congregations in the county are of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church.

Orthodox congregations in the county are predominantly under the jurisdiction of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church.

Several congregations of Baptists and other Christian churches operate in the county.

<doc id="236873" wikidata="Q4643725" url="?curid=236873" title="79 Group">
<text>The 79 Group was a faction within the Scottish National Party (SNP), named after its year of formation, 1979. The group sought to persuade the SNP to take an active left-wing stance, arguing that it would win more support, and were highly critical of the established SNP leaders. Although it had a small membership, the group caused sufficient disquiet that it was expelled from the SNP in 1982, although its members were subsequently readmitted and many attained senior positions in the Scottish Government after 2007. Alex Salmond, a leading member of the group, later became First Minister from 2007 to 2014.

==Background==
The idea for the 79 Group came from Roseanna Cunningham, then assistant research officer for the SNP, and her brother Chris, during the devolution referendum in early 1979. Although a majority of those voting backed devolution in the referendum, the vote was close and crucially the Yes votes did not reach the threshold of 40% of the electorate set by Parliament. At the SNP national council meeting a few days after the result of the referendum, Margo MacDonald argued that because working-class Scots had supported devolution and middle-class Scots had opposed, the SNP should aim to build its support among the working-class.

A group of eight SNP members who shared this opinion met on 10 March 1979. Before they could meet again, the SNP lost nine of its 11 seats in the 1979 general election; the poor result prompted a period of internal questioning by many SNP members about the direction the party should take. More than 30 attended a second meeting at the Belford Hotel in Edinburgh on 31 May which agreed to set up an &quot;Interim Committee for Political Discussion&quot;. This interim committee later became the 79 Group.

==Formation==
The founders decided to establish their group on a formal footing, with membership cards and elected officers. Three spokespeople were appointed, including Margo MacDonald and Alex Salmond. Stephen Maxwell became the group&#x27;s principal political theorist. The group was formed as a left wing organisation committed to the establishment of a &quot;socialist and republican Scotland&quot;. They began producing campaign material in support of their policies, and standing for internal SNP posts. The established SNP wing, now dubbed &quot;traditionalists&quot;, disliked the party appearing ideological. Winifred Ewing eventually formed the &#x27;Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland&#x27; as a second internal SNP group to oppose the 79 Group.

Many SNP activists became attracted to the 79 Group, seeing it as a debating forum to discuss the SNP&#x27;s future, but most left quickly when not attracted by the ideology driving the group. At the 1979 SNP conference, 79 Group candidates were heavily defeated by those in the SNP who put achieving independence over all other policy considerations.

==Advances==
In 1980, the former Labour MP and founder of the Scottish Labour Party (SLP), Jim Sillars, joined the SNP along with some other SLP members. Given the SLP&#x27;s stance on the left, Sillars was naturally in line with the 79 Group&#x27;s policy and immediately joined it too. Although no members of the 79 Group were elected to the SNP National executive at the 1980 conference less than a month after Sillars joined, at the 1981 SNP conference, five were.

==Scottish Resistance==
A passionate appeal by Stephen Maxwell failed to get a motion critical of private industry passed at the 1981 conference, but conference did vote by a big majority for a motion calling for &quot;a real Scottish resistance&quot; including &quot;political strikes and civil disobedience on a mass scale&quot; after a speech by Sillars. The new policy, dubbed &quot;Scottish Resistance&quot;, was unveiled in September 1981 with a logo consisting of figures with raised clenched fists.

Sillars, who was elected as the SNP&#x27;s Executive Vice-Chairman for Policy, was put in charge of the campaign with the details planned by the Demonstrations Committee. He led the campaign on 16 October 1981 by breaking in, with five other 79 Group members, to the Royal High School in Edinburgh which had been converted to house the Scottish Assembly. The intention had been to symbolically read out a declaration on what the Scottish Assembly would have done to counter unemployment, but the participants were arrested before they had the chance, and a planned later mass demonstration was cancelled. Sillars was later fined for wilful damage by breaking a window to get in. Many in the SNP were uncomfortable with this sort of action; three senior members were quoted in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; opposing the occupation.

==79 Group News==
From the Spring of 1981, the 79 Group published a monthly newsletter entitled &quot;79 Group News&quot;. The Editorial Committee comprised Chris Cunningham, Stewart Buchanan, Steve Butler, Graeme Purves and Douglas Robertson. After the group was proscribed, Graeme Purves, Douglas Robertson and graphic designer Crawford Cumming became members of the team which relaunched &quot;Radical Scotland&quot; as a bi-monthly political magazine edited by Kevin Dunion in February 1983.

==Proscription of the 79 Group==
Early in 1982, Sinn Féin wrote inviting a 79 Group speaker to its ardfheis (conference). With Provisional Irish Republican Army violence ongoing, Sinn Féin were considered unacceptable to public opinion in Great Britain. Alex Salmond moved to reject the request and won, but minutes of the meeting were leaked to the press, linking the two groups. Soon after, the 1982 conference of the SNP voted to ditch &quot;Scottish Resistance&quot;, despite a strong speech by Salmond claiming that to do so was to adopt &quot;a defeatist and cringing mentality&quot;. Many non-79 Group members felt that the civil disobedience campaign had collapsed in farce.

The SNP leadership under Gordon Wilson finally decided that the group&#x27;s activity must be stopped. At the 1982 SNP conference in Ayr, Wilson threatened to resign unless the conference passed a motion to proscribe all organised political groupings within the party (the motion covered Winifred Ewing&#x27;s Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland as well). He won what was described as a Pyrrhic victory by 308 to 188. However the 79 Group&#x27;s members mostly retained their offices within the party.

==Expulsions==
After the conference resolution, the 79 Group decided to agree to disband, but rather than going away, the Group formed an interim committee to create the &quot;79 Group Socialist Society&quot; outside the party. The interim committee was the same as the executive of the 79 Group. The National Executive declared that membership of this committee was incompatible with that of the SNP.

Armed with the conference mandate, the leadership then moved to expel the leading 79 Group members. Alex Salmond, Kenny MacAskill, Stephen Maxwell, and others were expelled; Roseanna Cunningham was not, on the grounds that she was not a member of the interim committee. Margo MacDonald was not expelled but resigned from the SNP in protest. Other members of the 79 Group in party offices were left alone; when the expelled members appealed against their expulsion, the committee hearing the appeal included 79 Group member Stewart Stevenson.

A Scottish Socialist Society was formed, open to non-SNP members; among those who joined were Susan Deacon and Sarah Boyack, who later became Labour MSPs. However the society was short-lived.

The appeals were narrowly rejected when the SNP National Council debated the report of the Appeals Committee. However, the substantial support for those expelled and the minority report submitted by Stewart Stevenson persuaded National Council to allow their re-admission to the SNP. Once back in the party many would go on to high office in the SNP.

<text>Krishnankoil Venkadachalam Mahadevan (14 March 1918 – 21 June 2001) was an Indian composer, singer-songwriter, music producer, and musician who won the inaugural National Film Award for Best Music Direction in (1967) for &quot;Kandan Karunai&quot;. Known for his works in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada films. He is best known for his contributions in works such as &quot;Manchi Manasulu&quot; (1962), &quot;Lava Kusa&quot; (1963), &quot;Thiruvilaiyadal&quot; (1965), &quot;Saraswathi Sabatham&quot; (1966), &quot;Kandan Karunai&quot; (1967), &quot;Thillana Mohanambal&quot; (1968), &quot;Adimai Penn&quot; (1969), &quot;Balaraju Katha&quot; (1970), &quot;Athiparasakthi&quot; (1971), &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; (1979), &quot;Saptapadi&quot; (1981), &quot;Sirivennela&quot; (1986), &quot;Sruthilayalu&quot; (1987), &quot;Sutradharulu&quot; (1989), &quot;Pelli Pustakam&quot; (1991), and &quot;Swathi Kiranam&quot; (1992).

A contemporary of M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy, starting his career in 1942 with &quot;Manonmani&quot;, Mahadevan scored music for over six hundred feature films, spanning four decades, and has garnered two National Film Awards, three Andhra Pradesh state Nandi Awards, a Tamil Nadu State Film Award, and a Filmfare Award South. He was also conferred the title of &quot;Thirai Isai Thilagam&quot; (Pride of Cine Music Directors) in Tamil cinema. His assistant Pukazhenthi is credited to have usually writing the score and arranging the orchestra, after Mahadevan composes a tune.

== Early life and career ==

K. V. Mahadevan was born in 1918 at Krishnancoil, a locality in Nagercoil, Kanyakumari District. Father Venkadachalam Bhagavathar and Mother Pichaiyammal
K. V. Mahadevan, also called by his honorific name Thirai Isai Thilagam (lit. pride of film music), did music composing for more than 50 years, beginning from 1942 until 1993.

Telugu Film Industry crowned him with title &quot;Swara Brahma&quot; (Creator/Father of Musical notes).
His song &quot;mama mama mama&quot; from 1962 Telugu movie Manchi Manasulu became popular those days, as a result, Telugu film industry with love started calling him &quot;Mama&quot; since then.

His favorite music instrument is Nadaswaram similar to (Shehnai).It could be the reason his compositions have always reflected its mellifluous pattern.
Another great characteristic from this scholar as it is known to everyone and open fact that he never asked lyricist to write lyrics for his earlier composed tunes. Always composed tunes to written lyrics.Very few in India have been able to exercise this feat with success.

Music has no Language barriers.
&quot;Sisurvethi, pasurvethi, vethiganarasamphanihi&quot; is a popular Sanskrit axiom which says that Music has the power to impress a child, animal, and the universe alike.
As we can read from Climax song of film Sankarabharanam (1980 film), &quot;Tatva Saadhana ku Satya Shodhana ku Sangeethame Sopanam&quot; (Music is a Stair Case for attaining Enlightenment and truth discovery)

&quot;Swara Brahma&quot; left no foot prints of his mother tongue when it comes to his scores in other languages.
Telugu language being inherited from Sanskrit, has its own nativity which composers of Telugu as their mother tongue and &quot;North&quot; (O. P. Nayyar), &quot;West&quot; (C. Ramchandra), (Shankar–Jaikishan), (Laxmikant–Pyarelal), (Chirrantan Bhatt), &quot;East&quot; (R. D. Burman), (Salil Chowdhury), (Ravindra Jain), (Bappi Lahiri) like composers could fulfill effortlessly.
&quot;Swara Brahma&quot; automatically had fallen into that groove as he was getting to know meaning of lyrics for every song before composing them. Assistant Puhalendi too exhibited similar characteristics as it was evident from interludes orchestration.

According to famous Director K. Raghavendra Rao opinion as expressed by him, Mama &quot;Mahadevan&quot; is &quot;Saraswati Putra&quot; and
K. Chakravarthy is &quot;Ekalavya&quot;.
His 1977 film Adavi Ramudu (1977 film) was recorded as the highest grossing Telugu film of the 1970s.
Director K. Raghavendra Rao &#x27;s father K. S. Prakash Rao mostly worked with Pendyala Nageswara Rao between 1950&amp;1974.
K. Chakravarthy too composed good music for music lover K. Raghavendra Rao previous movies Jyothi (1976 film) and Kalpana (1977 film).

But Production house Sathya Chitra earlier production Tahsildar Gari Ammayi music was scored by Mama.
Based on their faith, Sathya chitra insisted and retained &quot;Mama&quot; for N. T. Rama Rao movie Adavi Ramudu (1977 film).
Mama&#x27;s composition &quot;Krushi vunte Manushulu Rushulavutaaru&quot; (Effort makes Humans Saints) stands testimony to all stake holders of this movie and to every one who believes in determination.
&quot;Yuva Chitra Arts&quot; banner Producer K. Murari being ardent fan of &quot;Mama&quot; stopped producing movies ever since &quot;Mama&quot; called it a day in his career.
Director Bapu (director), Producer S. Gopala Reddy, Director Kodi Ramakrishna and later in his career actor Mohan Babu loved working with &quot;Mama&quot;.
It would be tough to guess between &quot;Swara Brahma&quot; and Director &quot;K. Viswanath&quot; as to, who was elemental in whose fame.
Combined effort returned laurels to art of Cinema. May be &quot;Vidhaata talapuna prabhavinchinadi anaadi Jeevana Vedam&quot;.
Contemporary musician P. Bhanumathi criticized &quot;Mama&quot; about his score for movie Sankarabharanam (1980 film) as lighter version Carnatic music Raga &#x27;s rendered by him. Later she even went on to sing a song &quot;Shree Surya Narayanaa Melukoo&quot; for &quot;Mama&quot; in his 1984 movie Mangammagari Manavadu .

His music assistant known as Puhalendi in Telugu film industry was with him like a life partner throughout his life, though scored few films on his own.
Mahadevan-Puhalendi Pukazhenthi as music director duo scored music for 1993 N. T. Rama Rao movie Srinatha Kavi Sarvabhowmudu directed by Bapu (director).

<text>Kalevipoeg (, Kalev&#x27;s Son) is a 19th-century epic poem by Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald which has since been considered the Estonian national epic.

== Origins ==
In pre-Christian ancient Estonia there existed an oral tradition, known as runic song, of legends explaining the origin of the world. Within old Estonian folklore, a benevolent giant by the name of &quot;Kalev&quot;, &quot;Kalevine&quot;, &quot;Kalevipoiss&quot;, &quot;Kalevine poisikine&quot; and &quot;Kalevin poika&quot; appears, battling with other giants or enemies of the nation. Early written references are found in Leyen Spiegel in 1641 as &quot;Kalliweh&quot;, and in a list of deities published by Mikael Agricola in 1551 as &quot;Caleuanpoiat&quot;.

The earliest remaining written reference to Kalevipoeg – also known as Kaleva in Finland – is by many experts considered to be one found in Widsith, also known as &quot;The Traveller&#x27;s Song&quot;, which also provides the earliest known written usage of the name Viking, with the spelling &quot;wicing&quot;. Widsith is a 6th or 7th century Anglo-Saxon poem – or song – of 143 lines, which became copied into the Exeter Book, a manuscript of Old English poetry compiled in the late 10th century. Widsith is for the most part a survey of the people, kings and heroes of Europe in the Germanic Heroic Age.

The following is stated in Widsith:
&quot;&quot;Caesar ruled the Greeks, Caelic the Finns ... I was with the Greeks and Finns and also with Caesar ...&quot;.&quot;

Many historians and folklorists believe Widsith&#x27;s &quot;Caelic&quot; to be a reference to the ancient Finnic ruler Kaleva/Kalevi, discussed in both the Finnish epic &quot;Kalevala&quot; and the Estonian epic &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot;.

==History==
The main material is taken from Estonian folklore of a giant hero named Kalevipoeg (&quot;Kalev&#x27;s son&quot;). These tales mainly interpret various natural objects and features as traces of Kalevipoeg&#x27;s deeds and have similarities with national epics from neighbouring regions, especially the Finnish &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

In 1839, Friedrich Robert Faehlmann read a paper at the Learned Estonian Society about the legends of Kalevipoeg. He sketched the plot of a national romantic epic poem. In 1850, after Faehlmann&#x27;s death, Kreutzwald started writing the poem, interpreting it as the reconstruction of an obsolete oral epic. He collected oral stories and wove them together into a unified whole.

The first version of &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot; (1853; 13,817 verses) could not be printed due to censorship. The second, thoroughly revised version (19,087 verses) was published in sequels as an academic publication by the Learned Estonian Society in 1857–1861. The publication included a translation into German. In 1862, the third, somewhat abridged version (19,023 verses) came out. This was a book for common readers. It was printed in Kuopio, Finland.

==Characters==

In Estonian (mainly East Estonian) legends, Kalevipoeg carries stones or throws them at enemies, and also uses planks edgewise as weapons, following the advice of a hedgehog. He also forms surface structures on landscape and bodies of water and builds towns. He walks through deep water. Kalevipoeg eventually dies after his feet are cut off by his own sword owing to his own priorand fatally ambiguousinstructions.

Kalevipoeg was the youngest son of Kalev and Linda, born after his father&#x27;s death and surpassed his brothers in intelligence and strength. It is often thought that Kalevipoeg&#x27;s real name was Sohni/Soini, but it actually means simply &#x27;son&#x27; and he never had other name than Kalevipoeg. Alevipoeg, and Sulevipoeg were his brothers.

The character only rarely appears in folk songs. In literature, he was first mentioned by Heinrich Stahl in the 17th century.

==Synopsis==

Kalevipoeg travels to Finland in search of his kidnapped mother. During his travel he purchases a sword but kills the blacksmith&#x27;s eldest son in an argument. The blacksmith places a curse on the sword. On returning to Estonia Kalevipoeg becomes king after defeating his brothers in a stone hurling competition. He constructs towns and forts and tills the land in Estonia. Kalevipoeg then journeys to the ends of the earth to expand his knowledge. He defeats Satan in a trial of strength and rescues three maidens from hell. War breaks out and destruction visits Estonia. Kalevipoeg&#x27;s faithful comrades are killed, after which he hands the kingship to his brother Olev and withdraws to the forest, depressed. Crossing a river, the sword cursed by the Blacksmith and previously lost in the river attacks and cuts off his legs. Kalevipoeg dies and goes to heaven. Taara, in consultation with the other gods, reanimates Kalevipoeg, places his legless body on a white steed, and sends him down to the gates of hell where he is ordered to strike the rock with his fist, thus entrapping hell in the rock. So Kalevipoeg remains to guard the gates of hell.

==Structure==

===Poetic structure===
The epic is written in old Estonian alliterative verse. Approximately one eighth of the verses are authentic; the rest are imitation.

===Contents and synopses===

The Kalevipoeg consists of twenty cantos.

Canto I - The marriages of Salme and Linda

:Three brothers travel to different places. The youngest is Kalev. He is taken to Estonia on the back of a great eagle. He becomes king of the land.
:A widow walks alone and finds a hen, a grouse&#x27;s egg and a crow on her travels. She takes them home and the former 2 grow into the maidens Salme and Linda. The crow--which she discarded--grows into a servant girl.
:Many suitors come to the girls, Salme and Linda. Salme is wooed by the sun, moon and stars themselves. Linda is also wooed by them, but she chooses Kalev, the frightening giant, as her husband. Salme and Linda leave with their respective husbands to complete their lives with them.

Canto II - The death of Kalev

:Kalev dies, but before his death prophesies the greatness of his unborn sons.
:Linda weeps for seven days and nights over her husband&#x27;s death. Her tears create Lake Ülemiste, situated in Tallinn nowadays. She then prepares him for his funeral and buries him, constructing, as his burial mound, what is now known as the hill of Toompea in the process.
:Linda feels the birth of her son approaching and asks the gods for help. Uku comes to her aid with bedding and comfort.
:When her son is born, he cries for months and proceeds to tear his clothes and cradle. He grows quickly, learns the trades of the land and plays games.

Canto III - The fate of Linda

:The 3 sons of Kalev go on a hunting trip, leaving their mother to attend to her duties at home.
:While the men are off hunting, a Finnish sorcerer (who had previously tried to win the hand of Linda and failed), &quot;Tuuslar&quot;, sneaks up on Linda and steals her away. She fights hard and manages to get away. She is turned into stone by the gods.
:The brothers return and search in vain for their mother. Kalevipoeg asks for help from his father&#x27;s grave.

Canto IV - The island maiden

:Kalevipoeg swims to Finland. He stops off at an island where he meets and seduces a beautiful maiden.
:The maiden hears the name and origin of Kalevipoeg and is horrified. She loses her footing and plunges into the water. Kalevipoeg jumps in after her but is unable to find her so he carries on to Finland.
:The maiden&#x27;s parents check the sea and find an oak and fir tree and other trinkets, but not their daughter.
:A song rises up from the sea telling the story of how the maiden was seduced down into the deep.

Canto V - Kalevipoeg and the Finnish sorcerer

:The parents of the maiden plant the oak tree they found at the bottom of the sea. In a short time it grows to the sky. The mother finds a small man hiding in the wings of an eagle, he is asked to fell the tree, he agrees on the condition he is let free.
:Kalevipoeg reaches Finland and finds the sorcerer in his house. The sorcerer creates a huge army to fend off Kalevipoeg, but he fells them all with his mighty strength and proceeds to question the sorcerer about his mother. When he fails to answer, Kalevipoeg crushes his head with his club and proceeds to weep for his crime.

Canto VI - Kalevipoeg and the swordsmiths

:Kalevipoeg visits Ilmarinen, the famous Finnish blacksmith, and asks him to create a sword. He presents various swords. He tests them by striking them against the cliff walls of the smithy, itself. None are adequate, so Ilmarinen presents a sword created at the bequest of Kalev, which pleases Kalevipoeg greatly. This sword, imbued with magical properties and having taken 7 years to forge, Kalevipoeg tests by striking against the anvil upon which it was forged, which it splits in two. This proves the sword&#x27;s worthiness and he agrees to pay a rich price for it to Ilmarine.
:A great feast and drinking bout is held. Unfortunately, Kalevipoeg argues with, gets angry and fells the head of Ilmarinen&#x27;s eldest son (who is also intoxicated at this point, as is Kalevipoeg) with the very sword he helped create. Ilmarinen curses the sword. He leaves and later realises his second great crime and weeps.
:The great oak tree of the maiden of the island is felled to create a bridge, ships and a hut.

Canto VII - The return of Kalevipoeg

When he finds it, he consults it and finds it is happier in the stream. He leaves it there, but orders it to cut off the feet of the sorcerer should he ever return.
:Kalevipoeg carries on in this journey and meets a man of human stature who regales him with a story of giants. Kalevipoeg is amused and offers his protection. He places the man in his wallet.

Canto XII - The fight with the sorcerer&#x27;s sons

:The three sons of the sorcerer attack Kalevipoeg while he is walking on his way. He fights hard but gains no ground until he hears and heeds the advice of a small voice from the underbrush. He defeats the sorcerer&#x27;s sons and asks his helper to show himself. After some persuasion, his helper comes out of the underbrush and Kalevipoeg cuts some of his coat for the small creature to cover himself up, but only cuts enough to cover his back.
:Kalevipoeg discovers that man in his wallet is dead and grieves. He falls asleep and is enchanted by the sorcerer. He sleeps for 7 weeks and dreams about Ilmarine&#x27;s workshop.

Kalevipoeg uses the magic hat to make himself appear smaller.
:When Devil returned, he demanded Kalevipoeg explain himself. Kalevipoeg makes his challenge and the 2 combatants wrestle viciously. When they stop for a rest, Kalevipoeg uses the hat to regain his old size and strength and bashes Devil into the ground.

:After the dwarf has appeared to all of the heroes the daughters of the Meadow Queen dance and sing and tell the tale of adventures still to come to Kalevipoeg.

Canto XVIII - Kalevipoeg&#x27;s journey to Hell 

:Kalevipoeg wakes in the night and finds the gates to Hell. He enters and proceeds into the depths of hell itself, aided by creatures along the way.
:Kalevipoeg comes across a large iron bridge and the huge army of Devil. He battles hard and eventually gets over the bridge to the palace of Devil. He beats his way in and is greeted by a vision of his mother and Devil&#x27;s mother.

Canto XIX - The last feast of the heroes

:Kalevipoeg and Devil have a lengthy wrestling match in which Kalevipoeg prevails. He binds Devil heavily with chains, takes a small treasure and leaves for the world of men.
:Kalevipoeg and his friends have a meal of ox which Alevipoeg was able to kill.
:Kalevipoeg and his friends return to Lindanisa and a great feast and drinking bout begins. Many songs are sung and much joy is in the air. There is news of yet another invasion from all sides of the country by many enemies.
:Varrak departs for Lapland, taking with him a book of wisdom, given to him by Kalevipoeg, much to the dismay of the Olevipoeg and Sulevipoeg.
:Many refugees arrive with news of the impending battles. Kalevipoeg consults his Father&#x27;s grave, but no answer comes.

Canto XX - Armageddon
:Kalevipoeg and his friends prepare for war. Kalevipoeg buries his treasure and protects it with incantations to Taara.
:Kalevipoeg and his friends engage in a fierce battle which lasts many days and in which Kalevipoeg loses his horse and Sulevipoeg is badly injured. Sulevipoeg eventually dies.
:Olevipoeg builds a large bridge over the river Võhandu and the army proceeds over to engage the remaining enemy. The battle rages hard for many days until the heroes are exhausted and decide to take a drink. Alevipoeg slips and falls into the lake and drowns.
:Kalevipoeg is so grief-stricken he abdicates and places his kingdom in the hands of Olevipoeg. Kalevipoeg leaves for a peaceful life on the banks of the river Koiva. He does not get the peace he desires and is annoyed by many visitors, some aggressive. He wanders around the country annoyed by these intrusions and makes his way to Lake Peipus. He wades into Kääpa, the brook where his old sword lay, and the sword keeps its promise to cut off the feet of anyone who dares wade in the brook. Unfortunately, Kalevipoeg had forgotten this promise and his feet are cut off.
:Kalevipoeg dies and is taken to heaven. However, he is deemed too valuable and is reanimated in his old body to stand guard for eternity at the gates of Hell to keep watch on Devil and his demons. He is there still tied to the gates of Hell by his hand, which is locked in a rock.

== Comparative mythology ==
*The amputation of the legs of Kalevipoeg by a magical sword is similar to the Hurrian mythic theme of the amputation of the feet of Ullikummi by a supernatural knife. According to Eustathius (&quot;ad Hor&quot;.), the Telkhin-es were likewise beings without feet.

== Influences ==
&quot;Kalevipoeg&quot; has been referenced in both official contexts and in popular culture. The Estonian Declaration of Independence begins with a passage that quotes a god in Canto XX, right after the death of the protagonist Kalevipoeg: &quot;In the course of centuries never have the Estonian people lost their desire for independence. From generation to generation have they kept alive the hidden hope that in spite of enslavement and oppression by hostile invaders the time will come to Estonia &#x27;when all splints, at both end, will burst forth into flames&#x27; and when &#x27;Kalev will come home to bring his children happiness&#x27;. Now that time has arrived.&quot;

<text>The Estonian Provincial Assembly or Estonian State Diet, also often called by its Estonian name Maapäev, was elected in May–June 1917 during the Russian Revolution as the provincial parliament (&quot;diet&quot;) of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia. On 28 November 1917, after the October Revolution in Russia, the Assembly declared itself the sole sovereign power in Estonia and called for the elections of the Estonian Constituent Assembly. On the eve of the German occupation of Estonia during World War I the council elected the Estonian Salvation Committee and issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence on 24 February 1918.

==History==

On 12 April 1917 the Russian Provisional Government issued an order on the provisional autonomy of Estonia. The Governorate of Estonia (now northern Estonia) was merged with Estonian-speaking northern part of the Governorate of Livonia (now southern Estonia), to form the autonomous governorate. The Russian Provisional Government decreed that the provincial assembly be created with members elected by indirect universal suffrage.

Elections for the 62 deputies of the Maapäev were held in many stages; members representing the rural communities were elected in two-tiered elections in May–June, while the town representatives were elected in July–August 1917. The election process saw the creation and reorganization of Estonian national parties.

Six parties were represented at the diet, with three independent deputies and two deputies representing the local German and Swedish-speaking minorities.

==Results==


== Aftermath ==
In the wake of the November 1917 Bolshevik coup in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), when the Bolshevik &quot;Estonian Military Revolutionary Committee&quot; staged a similar coup in the Estonian capital Reval (Tallinn), the &quot;Maapäev&quot; refused to recognize the new Bolshevik rule. The Bolsheviks then attempted to disband the council. In its last meeting on 15 November 1917, the &quot;Maapäev&quot; proclaimed itself the supreme legal authority of Estonia until the convening of the Constituent Assembly. The Committee of Elders was authorized to issue laws. The council was then dissolved by force on 26 November by the Bolsheviks, compelling leading politicians to go underground. In the Constituent Assembly elections in early 1918, which were organised by the Bolsheviks, two-thirds of the voters supported the parties who stood for national statehood. The Bolsheviks then immediately proclaimed the elections null and void. On 19 February 1918, the Committee of Elders of the Land Council decided to proclaim Estonian independence. A Salvation Committee (a three-member committee formed by the Maapäev as executive body for the time when the activities of the Assembly were hindered) with special powers was set up for that purpose. On 24 February, after the Bolsheviks abandoned Tallinn and one day before German forces occupied the country&#x27;s capital city, the Salvation Committee issued a formal declaration of independence of the Republic of Estonia.

After the German occupation of Estonia ended, the Maapäev continued as the legislature of Estonia until 1919.

<doc id="236890" wikidata="Q6743219" url="?curid=236890" title="Malgudi">
<text>Malgudi () is a fictional town located in Agumbe situated in the Shivamogga district of the Indian state of Karnataka in the novels and short stories of R. K. Narayan. It forms the setting for most of Narayan&#x27;s works. Starting with his first novel, &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;, all but one of his fifteen novels and most of his short stories take place here. Malgudi was a portmanteau of two Bengaluru localities - Malleshwara and Basavana Gudi.

Narayan has successfully portrayed Malgudi as a microcosm of India. Malgudi was created, as mentioned in &quot;Malgudi Days&quot;, by Sir Fredrick Lawley, a fictional British Raj British officer in the 19th century by combining and developing a few villages. The character of Sir Fredrick Lawley may have been based on Arthur Lawley, the Governor of Madras in 1905. But now MP of Shimoga (Lok Sabha constituency) has requested Indian Railways to rename Arasalu Railway Station a small station on Shimoga-Talaguppa railway line to Malgudi Railway station. Swami and friends also seems to have taken place during the swadeshi and boycott movement against British

==Geography and origins==
Malgudi is located on the banks of the fictional river Sarayu, near the also-fictional Mempi forest, on the border of the states of Mysore and Madras and a few hours away from Madras.

Narayan&#x27;s assertion that Malgudi is work of fiction has not deterred readers from speculating about its actual location being Mysore, with a river on one side and a forest on the other, and buildings and lanes similar to those of Malgudi, such as Lawley road, Variety Hall, and Bombay Anand Bhavan. Other possible &#x27;locations&#x27; include Lalgudi situated on the banks of the river Kaveri and Yadavgiri in the erstwhile state of Mysore.

Malgudi was a portmanteau of two Bangalore localities - Malleshwaram and Basavanagudi, the story is apocryphal. He created the town in September 1930, on Vijayadashami, an auspicious day to start new efforts and thus chosen for him by his grandmother. As he mentioned in a later interview to his biographers Susan and N. Ram, in his mind, he first saw a railway station, and slowly the name Malgudi came to him.

==Localities and landmarks==

===Sarayu River===
Malgudi is located on the banks of the river Sarayu. In &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;, Swami, Mani and Rajam spend most of their evenings playing or chatting by the river. In &quot;The Guide&quot;, holy-man Raju fasts on the banks of the dry river Sarayu, praying for the rains to come. When Mahatma Gandhi visits Malgudi, the meetings and speeches are held right on the banks of river Sarayu.

===Streets and neighbourhoods===
Market Street is the central street of Malgudi, the location of several big shops including Bombay Anand Bhavan and Truth Printing Works. Kabir Street is the residence of the elite of Malgudi, while Lawley Extension is a new upcoming lane housing the rich and the influential. Elleman Street, home to the oil-mongers, is the last street and beyond it lies the river Sarayu. Other streets include Grove Street, Kalighat Lane and Vinayak Muduli Street.

Between Elleman Street and the river lie Mallappa&#x27;s Grove and the cremation ground. The Untouchables and sweepers live on the lower banks of the river.

===Buildings===
Palace Talkies was built in 1935 to replace the old Variety Hall. Albert Mission School and Albert Mission College are the more popular educational institutions. There are also the board school and the town elementary schools.

===Other landmarks===
Malgudi has a small railway station which in many episodes, is central to the storyline. The main hospital of Malgudi is Malgudi Medical Centre (MMC). The statue of Sir Fredrick, seated on a horse, forms another major landmark. Another important place is The Board less, a small restaurant without any board. Boardless is a centre of discussion for current events in Malgudi.

===Mempi Forest===
Mempi forest is on the other side of Sarayu. It houses many hills and caves. Animals to be found there include tigers, members of the deer family, langurs and water buffalos.

==Conceptualization==
Various critics compare Narayan&#x27;s Malgudi with Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex or William Faulkner&#x27;s Yoknapatawpha. It was a town created from his own experiences, his childhood, his upbringing. The people in it were people he met every day. He thus created a place which every Indian could relate to. A place, where, in the words of Graham Greene (from the introduction to &quot;The Financial Expert&quot;), you could go &quot;into those loved and shabby streets and see with excitement and a certainty of pleasure a stranger approaching past the bank, the cinema, the hair cutting saloon, a stranger who will greet us, we know, with some unexpected and revealing phrase that will open the door to yet another human existence.&quot;

==In contemporary culture==
&quot;Malgudi Days&quot; a 1986 Indian television series directed by Kannada actor and director Shankar Nag, based on the eponymous works of R.K. Narayan was mostly shot near Agumbe in Shimoga District, Karnataka. Some episodes, however, were also shot at Bengaluru and Devarayanadurga in Tumakuru District, Karnataka.

The concept of &quot;Malgudi&quot; as an &quot;idyllic spot located in South India&quot; seems to have taken root in popular imagination. Some restaurants offering South Indian fare go by the name or extensions of &quot;Malgudi.&quot; The Shyam Group operates Malgudi restaurants in Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. A restaurant named &quot;Malgudi Junction&quot; is located in Kolkata.

<doc id="236893" wikidata="Q205175" url="?curid=236893" title="Interest rate cap and floor">
<text>In finance, an interest rate cap is a type of interest rate derivative in which the buyer receives payments at the end of each period in which the interest rate exceeds the agreed strike price. An example of a cap would be an agreement to receive a payment for each month the LIBOR rate exceeds 2.5%.

Similarly, an interest rate floor is a derivative contract in which the buyer receives payments at the end of each period in which the interest rate is below the agreed strike price.

Caps and floors can be used to hedge against interest rate fluctuations. For example, a borrower who is paying the LIBOR rate on a loan can protect himself against a rise in rates by buying a cap at 2.5%. If the interest rate exceeds 2.5% in a given period the payment received from the derivative can be used to help make the interest payment for that period, thus the interest payments are effectively &quot;capped&quot; at 2.5% from the borrowers&#x27; point of view.

==Interest rate cap==
An interest rate cap is a derivative in which the buyer receives payments at the end of each period in which the interest rate exceeds the agreed strike price. An example of a cap would be an agreement to receive a payment for each month the LIBOR rate exceeds 2.5%. They are most frequently taken out for periods of between 2 and 5 years, although this can vary considerably. Since the strike price reflects the maximum interest rate payable by the purchaser of the cap, it is frequently a whole number integer, for example 5% or 7%. By comparison the underlying index for a cap is frequently a LIBOR rate, or a national interest rate. The extent of the cap is known as its notional profile and can change over the lifetime of a cap, for example, to reflect amounts borrowed under an amortizing loan. The purchase price of a cap is a one-off cost and is known as the premium.

The purchaser of a cap will continue to benefit from any rise in interest rates above the strike price, which makes the cap a popular means of hedging a floating rate loan for an issuer.

The interest rate cap can be analyzed as a series of European call options, known as caplets, which exist for each period the cap agreement is in existence. To exercise a cap, its purchaser generally does not have to notify the seller, because the cap will be exercised automatically if the interest rate exceeds the strike (rate). Note that this automatic exercise feature is different from most other types of options. Each caplet is settled in cash at the end of the period to which it relates.

In mathematical terms, a caplet payoff on a rate &quot;L&quot; struck at &quot;K&quot; is

:formula_1

where &quot;N&quot; is the notional value exchanged and &quot;formula_2&quot; is the day count fraction corresponding to the period to which &quot;L&quot; applies. For example, suppose that it is January 2007 now and you own a caplet on the six month USD LIBOR rate with an expiry of 1 February 2007 struck at 2.5% with a notional of 1 million dollars. Next, if on 1 February the USD LIBOR rate sets at 3%, then you will receive the following payment:

formula_3

Customarily the payment is made at the end of the rate period, in this case on 1 August 2007.

==Interest rate floor==
An interest rate floor is a series of European put options or floorlets on a specified reference rate, usually LIBOR. The buyer of the floor receives money if on the maturity of any of the floorlets, the reference rate is below the agreed strike price of the floor.

==Interest rate collars and reverse collars==
An interest rate collar is the simultaneous purchase of an interest rate cap and sale of an interest rate floor on the same index for the same maturity and notional principal amount.
* The cap rate is set above the floor rate.
* The objective of the buyer of a collar is to protect against rising interest rates (while agreeing to give up some of the benefit from lower interest rates).
* The purchase of the cap protects against rising rates while the sale of the floor generates premium income.
* A collar creates a band within which the buyer&#x27;s effective interest rate fluctuates

A reverse interest rate collar is the simultaneous purchase of an interest rate floor and simultaneously selling an interest rate cap.
* The objective is to protect the bank from falling interest rates.
* The buyer selects the index rate and matches the maturity and notional principal amounts for the floor and cap.
* Buyers can construct zero cost reverse collars when it is possible to find floor and cap rates with the same premiums that provide an acceptable band.

==Valuation of interest rate caps==
The size of cap and floor premiums are impacted by a wide range of factors, as follows; the price calculation itself is performed by one of several approaches discussed below.
* The relationship between the strike rate and the prevailing 3-month LIBOR
** premiums are highest for in the money options and lower for at the money and out of the money options
* Premiums increase with maturity.
** The option seller must be compensated more for committing to a fixed-rate for a longer period of time.
* Prevailing economic conditions, the shape of the yield curve, and the volatility of interest rates.
** upsloping yield curve—caps will be more expensive than floors.
** the steeper is the slope of the yield curve, ceteris paribus, the greater are the cap premiums.
** floor premiums reveal the opposite relationship.

===Black model===
The simplest and most common valuation of interest rate caplets is via the Black model. Under this model we assume that the underlying rate is distributed log-normally with volatility formula_4. Under this model, a caplet on a LIBOR expiring at t and paying at T has present value

:formula_5
where
:&quot;P&quot;(0,&quot;T&quot;) is today&#x27;s discount factor for &quot;T&quot;
:&quot;F&quot; is the forward price of the rate. For LIBOR rates this is equal to formula_6
:&quot;K&quot; is the strike
:&quot;N&quot; is the standard normal CDF.
:formula_7
and
:formula_8

Notice that there is a one-to-one mapping between the volatility and the present value of the option. Because all the other terms arising in the equation are indisputable, there is no ambiguity in quoting the price of a caplet simply by quoting its volatility. This is what happens in the market. The volatility is known as the &quot;Black vol&quot; or implied vol.

As negative interest rates became a possibility and then reality in many countries at around the time of Quantitative Easing, so the Black model became increasingly inappropriate (as it implies a zero probability of negative interest rates). Many substitute methodologies have been proposed, including shifted log-normal, normal and Markov-Functional, though a new standard is yet to emerge.

===As a bond put===
It can be shown that a cap on a LIBOR from &quot;t&quot; to &quot;T&quot; is equivalent to a multiple of a &quot;t&quot;-expiry put on a &quot;T&quot;-maturity bond. Thus if we have an interest rate model in which we are able to value bond puts, we can value interest rate caps. Similarly a floor is equivalent to a certain bond call. Several popular short-rate models, such as the Hull–White model have this degree of tractability. Thus we can value caps and floors in those models.

===Valuation of CMS Caps===
Caps based on an underlying rate (like a Constant Maturity Swap Rate) cannot be valued using simple techniques described above. The methodology for valuation of CMS Caps and Floors can be referenced in more advanced papers.

==Implied Volatilities==
* An important consideration is cap and floor (so called Black) volatilities. Caps consist of caplets with volatilities dependent on the corresponding forward LIBOR rate. But caps can also be represented by a &quot;flat volatility&quot;, a single number which if plugged in the formula for valuing each caplet recovers the price of the cap i.e. the net of the caplets still comes out to be the same. To illustrate: (Black Volatilities) → (Flat Volatilities) : (15%,20%...,12%) → (16.5%,16.5%...,16.5%)
** Therefore, one cap can be priced at one vol. This is extremely useful for market practitioners as it reduces greatly the dimensionality of the problem: instead of tracking n caplet Black volatilities, you need to track just one: the flat volatility.
* Another important relationship is that if the fixed swap rate is equal to the strike of the caps and floors, then we have the following put–call parity: Cap-Floor = Swap.
* Caps and floors have the same implied vol too for a given strike.
** Imagine a cap with 20% vol and floor with 30% vol. Long cap, short floor gives a swap with no vol. Now, interchange the vols. Cap price goes up, floor price goes down. But the net price of the swap is unchanged. So, if a cap has x vol, floor is forced to have x vol else you have arbitrage.
* Assuming rates can&#x27;t be negative, a Cap at strike 0% equals the price of a floating leg (just as a call at strike 0 is equivalent to holding a stock) regardless of volatility cap.

<text>A reference rate is a rate that determines pay-offs in a financial contract and that is outside the control of the parties to the contract. It is often some form of LIBOR rate, but it can take many forms, such as a consumer price index, a house price index or an unemployment rate. Parties to the contract choose a reference rate that neither party has power to manipulate.

==Examples of use==
The most common use of reference rates is that of short-term interest rates such as LIBOR in floating rate notes, loans, swaps, short-term interest rate futures contracts, etc. The rates are calculated by an independent organisation, such as the British Bankers Association (BBA) as the average of the rates quoted by a large panel of banks, to ensure independence.

Another example is that of swap reference rates for constant maturity swaps. The ISDAfix rates used are calculated daily for an independent organisation, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, from quotes from a large panel of banks.

In the credit derivative market a similar concept to reference rates is used. Pay offs are not determined by a &quot;rate&quot;, but by possible &quot;events&quot;. In this case, the &quot;reference event&quot; has to be a very precisely defined credit event, to make sure there can be no disagreement on whether the event has occurred or not..

Typically the benchmark LIBOR is the three-month rate.

==Reference rates for short-term interest rates==
Examples of reference rates for short-term interest rates are:
* LIBOR - London Interbank Offered Rate. LIBOR was terminated in June 2023.
* SOFR - Secured Overnight Financing Rate. SOFR is a reference rate established as an alternative to LIBOR.
* Euribor - Euro Interbank Offered Rate
* EONIA - Euro OverNight Index Average. EONIA was replaced by the Euro short-term rate (€STR) in 2019.
* €STR - Euro short-term rate
* TIBOR - Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate. Euroyen TIBOR will be terminated in 2024.
* TONAR - Tokyo Overnight Average Rate
* SIBOR - Singapore Interbank Offered Rate
* STIBOR - Stockholm Interbank Offered Rate
* WIBOR - Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate
* MIBOR - Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate
* PRIBOR - Prague Interbank Offered Rate
* BUBOR - Budapest Interbank Offered Rate
* HIBOR - Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate
* SHIBOR - Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate
* ISDAfix - International Swap Dealers Association Fix
* TELBOR - Tel Aviv Interbank Offered Rate

<text>&quot;Negative capability&quot; is the capacity of artists to pursue ideals of beauty, perfection and sublimity even when it leads them into intellectual confusion and uncertainty, as opposed to a preference for philosophical certainty over artistic beauty. The term, first used by John Keats in 1817, has been subsequently used by poets, philosophers and literary theorists to describe the ability to perceive and recognize truths beyond the reach of what Keats called &quot;consecutive reasoning&quot;.

==Use by Keats==
John Keats used the phrase only briefly in a private letter to his brothers George and Thomas on 22 December 1817, and it became known only after his correspondence was collected and published. Keats described a conversation he had been engaged in a few days previously:
I had not a dispute but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge was, by 1817, a frequent target of criticism by the younger poets of Keats&#x27;s generation, often ridiculed for his infatuation with German idealistic philosophy. Against Coleridge&#x27;s obsession with philosophical truth, Keats sets up the model of Shakespeare, whose poetry articulated various points of view and never advocated a particular vision of truth.

Keats&#x27; ideas here, as was usually the case in his letters, were expressed tersely with no effort to fully expound what he meant, but passages from other letters enlarge on the same theme. In a letter to J.H. Reynolds in February 1818, he wrote:
We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us—and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great &amp; unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one&#x27;s soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.
In another letter to Reynolds the following May, he contrived the metaphor of &#x27;the chamber of maiden thought&#x27; and the notion of the &#x27;burden of mystery&#x27;, which together express much the same idea as that of negative capability:
I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects [which] this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one&#x27;s vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken&#x27;d and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil. We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the &#x27;burden of the Mystery,&#x27; To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote &#x27;Tintern Abbey&#x27; and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages. Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them. he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton[.]
Keats understood Coleridge as searching for a single, higher-order truth or solution to the mysteries of the natural world. He went on to find the same fault in Dilke and Wordsworth. All these poets, he claimed, lacked objectivity and universality in their view of the human condition and the natural world. In each case, Keats found a mind which was a narrow private path, not a &quot;thoroughfare for all thoughts&quot;. Lacking for Keats were the central and indispensable qualities requisite for flexibility and openness to the world, or what he referred to as negative capability.

This concept of negative capability is precisely a rejection of set philosophies and preconceived systems of nature. He demanded that the poet be receptive rather than searching for fact or reason, and to not seek absolute knowledge of every truth, mystery, or doubt.

Keat&#x27;s concept of negative capability can be understood as an author&#x27;s ability to enter fully and imaginatively into the characters, objects, and actions he represents. In his essay “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” T. S. Eliot wrote, “the progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality.” According to this line of interpretation, the author &quot;negates&quot; himself, in order to present a fully independent character, one with all the uncertainty and mutability of a real person. Brian Vickers comments, &quot;By &#x27;negative capability&#x27;, Keats probably meant Shakespeare&#x27;s ability to imagine himself in each dramatic scene, to efface himself, and to enter with complete sympathy into the passions and moods of his characters&quot;

==Use of the word &#x27;negative&#x27;==
Negative capability can be difficult to grasp, as it is not a name for a thing but rather a way of feeling or of knowing. The word &quot;negative&quot; is defined in opposition to the positivism prevalent at the time. In the same way that chameleons are &#x27;negative&#x27; for &quot;colour&quot;, according to Keats, poets are negative for &quot;self&quot; and &quot;identity&quot;: they change their identity with each subject they inhabit. The intuitive knowing of the inner life of, for example, a nightingale or a Grecian urn, could not be grasped as a concept, and would known through actual living experience of one&#x27;s everyday changeable being.

Another explanation of the word &quot;negative&quot; relies on hypothesising that Keats was influenced in his studies of medicine and chemistry, and that it refers to the negative pole of an electric current which is passive and receptive. In the same way that the negative pole receives the current from the positive pole, the poet receives impulses from a world that is full of mystery and doubt, which cannot be explained but which the poet can translate into art.

==Prepoetry==
Negative capability could also be understood as just one of a number of moods competing in the poet&#x27;s mind before a poem arrives, i.e. during the phase that may be called &quot;prepoetry&quot;, after the musical form of the same name which delights in &#x27;uncertainties, mysteries, [and] doubts&#x27;. At one point Coleridge thought of the poet as Truth&#x27;s Ventriloquist.
One way to approach the subject could be through the words of poets themselves, e.g.:

&quot;Emotion recollected in tranquility&quot; and &quot;wise passivity&quot; (e.g. Wordsworth), &quot;the systematic derangement of the senses&quot; (e.g. Rimbaud), &quot;Automatic writing and thought transference&quot; (e.g. Yeats), and &quot;Frenzy&quot; (e.g. Shakespeare). 
The poet&#x27;s eye, in fine frenzy rolling,&lt;br&gt;Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;&lt;br&gt;And as imagination bodies forth &lt;br&gt; forms of things unknown, the poet&#x27;s pen&lt;br&gt; Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing &lt;br&gt; A local habitation and a name.
(&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Act V scene 1, from line 1841)

==Reception==
===Roberto Mangabeira Unger, 2004===
In 2004, Brazilian philosopher Roberto Mangabeira Unger appropriated Keats&#x27; term in order to explain resistance to rigid social divisions and hierarchies where negative capability was the denial of whatever delivered over to a fixed scheme of division and hierarchy and to an enforced choice between routine and rebellion. Negative capability could empower against social and institutional constraints, and loosen the bonds entrapping people in a certain social station.

Unger claimed an example of negative capability could be seen in industrial innovation, when modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management, by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks. Unger claimed industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.

Negative capability is a key component in Unger&#x27;s theory of false necessity and formative context. The theory of false necessity claims that social worlds are the artifact of human endeavors. In order to explain how people move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and anti-necessitarian social thought, Unger recognized an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which could lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and empowerment (i.e. negative capability) would make change possible.

According to Unger negative capability addresses the problem of agency in relation to structure and unlike other theories of structure and agency, negative capability would not reduce the individual to a simple actor possessing only the dual capacity of compliance or rebellion.

===Wilfred Bion===
The twentieth-century British psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion elaborated on Keats&#x27;s term to illustrate an attitude of openness of mind which he considered of central importance, not only in the psychoanalytic session, but in life itself. For Bion, negative capability was the ability to tolerate the pain and confusion of not knowing, rather than imposing ready-made or omnipotent certainties upon an ambiguous situation or emotional challenge. His idea has been taken up more widely in the British Independent School, as well as elsewhere in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.

===Dimitris Lyacos===
Greek author Dimitris Lyacos has considered people living &quot;in the margins&quot; as possessing the negative capability that permits them to cross boundaries and, by accepting &quot;the burden of the mystery&quot;, explore uncertainty and the flux of life against western norms and structures. In a 2018 interview in Berfrois Magazine Lyacos noted: &quot;We carry with us a backpack of ideas, theories, insecurities and the detailed scenarios we project onto the future. Unlike us, outcasts, fugitives and people in the margins are the ones possessing the negative capability, the power to bear the &quot;burden of the mystery&quot;; immigrants cross seas that might engulf them. Their fear is overcome not only by the hope of a better life but also by their acceptance of those darker alleys, where time and space are created at the moment in which they are experienced.&quot;

===Zen===
The notion of negative capability has been associated with Zen philosophy. Keats&#x27; man of negative capability had qualities that enabled him to &quot;lose his self-identity, his &#x27;imaginative identification&#x27; with and submission to things, and his power to achieve a unity with life&quot;. The Zen concept of satori is the outcome of passivity and receptivity, culminating in &quot;sudden insight into the character of the real&quot;. Satori is reached without deliberate striving. The antecedent stages to satori: quest, search, ripening and explosion. The &quot;quest&quot; stage is accompanied by a strong feeling of uneasiness, resembling the capacity to practice negative capability while the mind is in a state of &quot;uncertainties, mysteries and doubts&quot;. In the explosive stage (akin to Keats&#x27; &#x27;chief intensity&#x27;), a man of negative capability effects a &quot;fellowship with essence&quot;.
===Mindfullness===
When humans are presented with external stress, the autonomic nervous system provides them with a &#x27;fight or flight&#x27; response, a binary choice. Fight or flight has been called positive capability. Teachers of mindfulness stress the importance of cultivating negative capability in order to overcome and provide an alternative to our routine reactions to stress. They point out that mindfullness teaches tolerance of uncertainty, and enriches decision making. It may not be productive to discuss whether negative or positive capability is more important, as they are analogous to the poles of a battery: a battery is only a battery if it has both positive and negative terminals.
==Criticism==
In 1989 Stanley Fish has expressed strong reservations about the attempt to apply the concept of negative capability to social contexts. He criticized Unger&#x27;s early work as being unable to chart a route for the idea to pass into reality, which leaves history closed and the individual holding onto the concept while kicking against air. Fish finds the capability Unger invokes in his early works unimaginable and unmanufacturable that can only be expressed outright in blatant speech, or obliquely in concept. More generally, Fish finds the idea of radical culture as an oppositional ideal in which context is continuously refined or rejected impracticable at best, and impossible at worst. Unger addressed these criticisms by developing a full theory of historical process in which negative capability is employed.

In &quot;The Life in the Sonnets&quot;, David Fuller made use of negative capability in 2012, addressing the qualities and potential of writing literary criticism. A critic&#x27;s experience and feelings altogether form a strong framework to expand one&#x27;s ability in critical thinking, while negative capability replaces the notion of correctness in analyzing literary texts.
==In film, poems, songs, and popular culture==
In 2018 the British singer-songwriter Marianne Faithfull released her album entitled &quot;Negative Capability&quot;. Later in November 2020, the BBC aired the second installment of the second series of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; based on the trilogy by Philip Pullman, of the same name. Here the idea of negative capability is given great prominence, in what for the BBC was its most lavish production to date. It is presented not as an idea or a theory or a concept or a thesis, but as a &quot;mood&quot; which the heroine Lyra is able to sink into, and which enables her especial ability to read the rare and beautiful and truth-telling alethiometer. This device, like a nightingale, issues a code that cannot be understood by purely reductive means. Its beauty is part of its truth. Lyra visits the Dark Materials Research Laboratory where she meets the chief researcher, Mary Malone, who, has the uncanny ability to see particles of dark matter, if she puts herself in the right mood. She tells Lyra &quot;you can&#x27;t see them unless you put your mind in a certain state. Do you know the poet John Keats? He has a phrase for it: negative capability. You have to hold your mind in a state of expectation without impatience...&quot; The implication is that Keats&#x27;s nightingale is his alethiometer, whose truth, like the truth of poetry itself, is not amenable to any amount of vivisection. Philip Pullman has written that &#x27;many poems are interrogated until they confess, and what they confess is usually worthless, as the results of torture always are: broken little scraps of information, platitudes, banalities&#x27;. But if we can follow Lyra and Mary Malone, and put ourselves in the right mood, the dark materials between the lines may become visible or audible. This is the nightingale&#x27;s code referred to in popular songs such as in one alternate-take version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot; and also in the song of the woodthrush in TS Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;Marina&quot;. In the latter&#x27;s case &#x27;where all the waters meet&#x27; is a neat confirmation of the negative polarity view of negative capability alluded to above. It is as if the poet&#x27;s mind is the negative terminal or the sinkhole in which everything meets and is reconciled. The negativity here depends on the self abnegation of the poet, and its that which allows the current to flow.

In 2013 jazz guitarist Bern Nix released an album titled &quot;Negative Capability&quot;, containing liner notes explaining Keats definition.

<doc id="236896" wikidata="Q6751763" url="?curid=236896" title="Mansion of Many Apartments">
<text>The Mansion of Many Apartments is a metaphor that the poet John Keats expressed in a letter to John Hamilton Reynolds dated Sunday, 3 May 1818.

: I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me - The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think - We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by awakening of the thinking principle - within us - we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one&#x27;s vision into the nature and heart of Man — of convincing one&#x27;s nerves that the World is full of misery and Heartbreak, Pain, sickness and oppression — whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken&#x27;d and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open - but all dark - all leading to dark passages — We see not the balance of good and evil. We are in a Mist - We are now in that state — We feel the burden of the Mystery.
Here Keats suggests that people were capable of different levels of thought. Those who did not consider the world around them remained in the thoughtless chamber. Even though the door to move on to the next &quot;apartment&quot; was open, they had no desire to think any deeper and to go into that next apartment.

When you did move on into the next chamber, you would for the first time have a choice of direction, as from this apartment there were several different dark passages. Keats believed that he was at this point when he wrote the letter, as was William Wordsworth when he wrote &quot;Tintern Abbey&quot;.

Keats expressed this idea in &quot;The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream&quot; (1819).

<doc id="236898" wikidata="Q5377756" url="?curid=236898" title="Engineer's blue">
<text>Engineer&#x27;s blue (also known as scraping blue, Prussian blue, or simply bluing) is a highly pigmented paste used to assist in the mating of two or more components.

==History==
Joseph Whitworth popularized the first practical method of making accurate flat surfaces, during the 1830s, by using engineer&#x27;s blue and scraping techniques on three trial surfaces. Prior to his scraping technique, the same three plate method was employed using polishing techniques, giving less accurate results. This improvement led to an explosion of development of precision instruments using these flat surface generation techniques as a basis for further construction of precise shapes.

==Preparation==
Engineer&#x27;s blue is prepared by mixing Prussian blue with a non-drying oily material (for example, grease). The coloured oil is rubbed onto a reference surface, and the workpiece is then rubbed against the coloured reference; the transfer (by contact) of the pigment indicates the position of high spots on the workpiece or conversely highlight low points. This method has been used to test the flatness of surfaces and the trueness of a bearing assembly.

The fitter may be told to &quot;blue it up&quot; when using this piece of equipment.

==Use in toolmaking==
Prussian blue is widely used by tool makers when the core and cavity of a mould is matched during final assembly. It is also used in other tooling applications, especially during assembly, such as stamping tools and pressure die casting tools. A thin coating of Prussian blue is applied (usually with a paint brush) on the &quot;insert&quot;, regardless of the shape or contour of the mould or tool before the matching is done with the mating part. If the Prussian blue (generally called just &quot;blue&quot;) appears evenly on the mating area, it is considered, by the tool makers, as &quot;good matching&quot;, indicating a good final product from the tool. Usually no tool would be transferred to testing or production without &quot;blue matching&quot;, (a term generally used by tool makers in Asia). Prussian blue is considered as an integral part of precision tool making.

<doc id="236899" wikidata="Q5273930" url="?curid=236899" title="Dictabelt">
<text>The Dictabelt, in early years and much less commonly also called a Memobelt, is an analog audio recording medium commercially introduced by the American Dictaphone company in 1947. Having been intended for recording dictation and other speech for later transcription, it is a write-once-read-many medium consisting of a thick transparent vinyl (according to a 1960s Dictaphone user manual: cellulose acetate butyrate) plastic belt wide and around. The belt is loaded onto a pair of metal cylinders, put under tension, then rotated like a tank tread. It is inscribed with an audio-signal-modulated helical groove by a stylus which is slowly moved across the rotating belt. Unlike the stylus of a record cutter, the Dictabelt stylus is blunt and in recording mode it simply impresses a groove into the plastic rather than engraving it and throwing off a thread of waste material. The Dictabelt system was popular, and by 1952, made up 90% of Dictaphone&#x27;s sales.

Dictabelts were more convenient and provide better audio quality than the reusable wax cylinders they replaced. The belts can be folded for storage and will fit into an ordinary letter-size envelope. However, the plastic loses flexibility as it ages. If a belt is stored sharply folded for a long time, it will become permanently creased and unplayable without special treatment. Dictabelts were red until 1964, blue from 1964 to 1975, then purple until they were discontinued around 1980. Each has a capacity of about 15 minutes at the standard speed. At least one Dictaphone model featured a half-speed, low-fidelity 30-minute option.

In the 1960s, Virginia required that all of its circuit courts be outfitted with Dictabelt machines.

Along with a Gray Audograph sound recorder, a Dictabelt recorded the police department radio channels in Dallas, Texas, during the John F. Kennedy assassination.
These recordings were reviewed by the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA).

<doc id="236901" wikidata="Q441809" url="?curid=236901" title="Franklin Rosemont">
<text>Franklin Rosemont (1943–2009) was an American poet, artist, historian, street speaker, and co-founder of the Chicago Surrealist Group. Over four decades, Franklin produced a body of work, of declarations, manifestos, poetry, collage, hidden histories, and other interventions.

== Early life ==

He was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Henry, a typographer and labor activist, and Sally, a jazz musician. In 1960, Rosemont dropped out of Proviso East High School, Maywood, Illinois, but was admitted to Roosevelt University in Chicago in 1962, studying under African-American scholar St. Clair Drake.

== Career ==

A self-identified anarchist, Rosemont edited the 1960s anarchist publication &quot;Rebel Worker&quot;. He edited and wrote an introduction for &quot;What is Surrealism?: Selected Writings of André Breton&quot;, and edited &quot;Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion&quot;, &quot;The Rise &amp; Fall of the DIL Pickle: Jazz-Age Chicago&#x27;s Wildest &amp; Most Outrageously Creative Hobohemian Nightspot&quot; and &quot;Juice Is Stranger Than Friction: Selected Writings of T-Bone Slim&quot;. With his wife Penelope Rosemont, herself the author and editor of several books and active in the Chicago Surrealists, and poet and storyteller Paul Garon, he edited &quot;The Forecast is Hot!&quot;. His work has been deeply concerned with both the history of surrealism (writing a forward for &quot;Max Ernst and Alchemy: A Magician in Search of Myth&quot;) and of the radical labor movement in America, for instance, writing a biography of Joe Hill. According to &quot;PoetrySoup.com&quot; Franklin Rosemont &quot;became perhaps &quot;the most productive scholar of labor and the left in the United States.&quot; Rosemont was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and Students for a Democratic Society. In 1964, he helped organize a strike among fellow blueberry pickers in Michigan.

== Publications ==
Rosemont is the author of the poetry collections &quot;The Morning of a Machine Gun: Twenty Poems &amp; Documents. Profusely Illustrated By the Author&quot;, &quot;The Apple of the Automatic Zebra&#x27;s Eye&quot;, and &quot;Penelope: A Poem&quot;, as well as &quot;An Open Entrance to the Shut Palace of Wrong Numbers&quot;, a book that explores the phenomenon of &quot;wrong numbers&quot; from a surrealist perspective, which was published by Black Swan Press in 2003. He also edited and introduced &quot;Hobohemia: Emma Goldman, Lucy Parsons, Ben Reitman &amp; other agitators &amp; outsiders in 1920s/30s Chicago&quot;, by Frank O. Beck.

In 1990, he published a collected edition of short stories by the socialist utopian author Edward Bellamy, titled &quot;Apparitions of Things to Come&quot;. He is co-editor, with Archie Green, David Roediger, and Salvatore Salerno, of &quot;The Big Red Songbook&quot; (Chicago: Charles H. Kerr, 2007).

<doc id="236903" wikidata="Q5969162" url="?curid=236903" title="When I Survey the Wondrous Cross">
<text>The hymn &quot;When I Survey the Wondrous Cross&quot; was written by Isaac Watts, and published in &quot;Hymns and Spiritual Songs&quot; in 1707. It is significant for being an innovative departure from the early English hymn style of only using paraphrased biblical texts, although the first couplet of the second verse paraphrases Galatians 6:14a and the second couplet of the fourth verse paraphrases Gal. 6:14b. The poetry of &quot;When I survey…&quot; may be seen as English literary baroque.

==Text==

The second line of the first stanza originally read &quot;Where the young Prince of Glory dy&#x27;d&quot;. Watts himself altered that line in the 1709 edition of &quot;Hymns and Spiritual Songs&quot;, to prevent it from being mistaken as an allusion to Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, the heir to the throne who died at age 11.

The hymn&#x27;s fourth stanza (&quot;His dying crimson...&quot;) is commonly omitted in printed versions, a practice that began with George Whitefield in 1757.

In the final stanza, some modern variations substitute the word &quot;offering&quot; for &quot;present&quot;.
&lt;poem&gt;
1. When I survey the wond&#x27;rous Cross
 On which the Prince of Glory dy&#x27;d,
 My richest Gain I count but Loss,
 And pour Contempt on all my Pride.

2. Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
 Save in the Death of Christ my God:
 All the vain Things that charm me most,
 I sacrifice them to his Blood.

3. See from his Head, his Hands, his Feet,
 Sorrow and Love flow mingled down!
 Did e&#x27;er such Love and Sorrow meet,
 Or Thorns compose so rich a Crown?

4. His dying Crimson, like a Robe,
 Spreads o&#x27;er his Body on the Tree;
 Then I am dead to all the Globe,
 And all the Globe is dead to me.

5. Were the whole Realm of Nature mine,
 That were a Present far too small;
 Love so amazing, so divine,
 Demands my Soul, my Life, my All.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Musical settings==

The hymn is usually sung to either &quot;Rockingham&quot; or &quot;Hamburg&quot;, the former being more closely associated with the text in British and Commonwealth hymnals. Another alternative, associated with the text in the 19th and 20th centuries, is &quot;Eucharist&quot; by Isaac B. Woodbury. Additionally, the hymn is often sung to the tune &quot;O Waly Waly&quot; (also known as &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot; a folk melody of Scottish origin from the 1600-1700s). Using this melody for the hymn seems to have become popular since the 1980s.
&quot;Rockingham&quot; was written by Edward Miller, the son of a stone mason who ran away from home to become a musician, being a flautist in Händel&#x27;s orchestra. It has long been associated with Watts&#x27; text in British and Commonwealth hymnals, first being associated with the text in the seminal &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; (1861), and appearing again in the 1906 English Hymnal:

&quot;Hamburg&quot; is an adaptation of a plainchant melody by American composer Lowell Mason, and it remains the most frequent pairing in the United States. First written in 1824 and published a year later, it was not set to this text until &quot;The Sabbath Hymn and Tune Book&quot; (1859), and even then it did not gain wide traction until late in the 19th century. Paul Westermeyer notes, however, that the tune is sometimes seen as less than an ideal match for the text, and that it is &quot;dull to the analyst, but often appreciated by congregations.&quot;

*Sung to the tune &#x27;Rockingham&#x27;, it has been used for many years by the BBC to introduce its 7am broadcast on Good Friday.
*It forms the musical setting for the culmination of a passion play told in dance choreographed by Walter Nicks, an American modern dancer.
*Contemporary Christian worship artists Matt Redman and Chris Tomlin recorded it as &quot;The Wonderful Cross&quot; for the latter&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Noise We Make&quot;, with an added chorus that follows a markedly contemporary format. Redman, though English, sings the traditional verses to the tune of &quot;Hamburg.&quot;
*Showbread, a Christian &quot;Raw Rock&quot; band, used excerpts of the lyrics in their song &quot;The Beginning&quot; from the album Nervosa.
*The tune is briefly quoted by Charles Ives in his Symphony No. 2 (Ives).

<doc id="236906" wikidata="Q9440" url="?curid=236906" title="Paolo Veronese">
<text>Paolo Caliari (152819 April 1588), known as Paolo Veronese ( , ; ), was an Italian Renaissance painter based in Venice, known for extremely large history paintings of religion and mythology, such as &quot;The Wedding at Cana&quot; (1563) and &quot;The Feast in the House of Levi&quot; (1573). Included with Titian, a generation older, and Tintoretto, a decade senior, Veronese is one of the &quot;great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the &quot;cinquecento&quot;&quot; and the Late Renaissance in the 16th century. Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with Mannerism, Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian.
His most famous works are elaborate narrative cycles, executed in a dramatic and colorful style, full of majestic architectural settings and glittering pageantry. His large paintings of biblical feasts, crowded with figures, painted for the refectories of monasteries in Venice and Verona are especially famous, and he was also the leading Venetian painter of ceilings. Most of these works remain &quot;in situ&quot;, or at least in Venice, and his representation in most museums is mainly composed of smaller works such as portraits that do not always show him at his best or most typical.

He has always been appreciated for &quot;the chromatic brilliance of his palette, the splendor and sensibility of his brushwork, the aristocratic elegance of his figures, and the magnificence of his spectacle&quot;, but his work has been felt &quot;not to permit expression of the profound, the human, or the sublime&quot;, and of the &quot;great trio&quot; he has often been the least appreciated by modern criticism. Nonetheless, &quot;many of the greatest artists ... may be counted among his admirers, including Rubens, Watteau, Tiepolo, Delacroix, and Renoir&quot;.

==Life and work==
===Birth and names===
Veronese took his usual name from his birthplace of Verona, then the largest possession of Venice on the mainland. The census in Verona attests that Veronese was born sometime in 1528 to a stonecutter, or &quot;spezapreda&quot; in the Venetian language, named Gabriele, and his wife Caterina. He was their fifth child. It was common for surnames to be taken from a father&#x27;s profession, and thus Veronese was known as Paolo Spezapreda. He later changed his name to Paolo Caliari, because his mother was the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman called Antonio Caliari. His earliest known painting is signed &quot;P. Caliari F., &quot;the first known instance in which he used this surname&quot;, and after using &quot;Paolo Veronese&quot; for several years in Venice, after about 1575 he resumed signing his paintings as &quot;Paolo Caliari&quot;. He was often called &quot;Paolo Veronese&quot; before the last century to distinguish him from another painter from Verona, &quot;Alessandro Veronese&quot;, now known as Alessandro Turchi (1578–1649).

===Youth===

By 1541, Veronese was apprenticed with Antonio Badile, who was later to become his father-in-law, and in 1544 was an apprentice of Giovanni Francesco Caroto; both were leading painters in Verona. An altarpiece painted by Badile in 1543 includes striking passages that were most likely the work of his fifteen-year-old apprentice; Veronese&#x27;s precocious gifts soon surpassed the level of the workshop, and by 1544 he was no longer residing with Badile. Although trained in the culture of Mannerism then popular in Parma, he soon developed his own preference for a more radiant palette.

In his late teens he painted works for important churches in Verona, and in 1551 he was commissioned by the Venetian branch of the important Giustiniani family to paint the altarpiece for their chapel in the church of San Francesco della Vigna, which was then being entirely rebuilt to the design of Jacopo Sansovino. In the same year he worked on the decoration of the Villa Soranzo near Treviso, with his fellow Veronese Giovanni Battista Zelotti and Anselmo Canneri; only fragments of the frescos remain, but they seem to have been important in establishing his reputation. The description by Carlo Ridolfi nearly a century later mentions that one of the mythological subjects was &quot;The Family of Darius before Alexander&quot;, the rare subject in Veronese&#x27;s grandest treatment of secular history, now in the National Gallery, London.

In 1552 Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga, great-uncle of the ruling Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, commissioned an altarpiece, &quot;Temptation of St. Anthony&quot; for Mantua Cathedral (now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen in Caen, France), which Veronese painted &quot;in situ&quot;. He doubtless used his time in Mantua to study the ceilings by Giulio Romano; it was as a painter of ceiling frescos that he would initially make his mark in Venice, where he based himself permanently from the following year.

===Venice===
Veronese moved to Venice in 1553 after obtaining his first state commission, ceilings in fresco decorating the &quot;Sala dei Consiglio dei Dieci&quot; (the Hall of the Council of Ten) and the adjoining &quot;Sala dei Tre Capi del Consiglio&quot; in the Doge&#x27;s Palace, in the new rooms replacing those lost in the fire of 1547. His panel of &quot;Jupiter Hurling Thunderbolts at the Vices&quot; for the former is now in the Louvre. He then painted a &quot;History of Esther&quot; on the ceiling for the church of San Sebastiano (1556–57). It was these ceiling paintings and those of 1557 in the Marciana Library (for which he was awarded a prize judged by Titian and Sansovino) that established him as a master among his Venetian contemporaries. Already these works indicate Veronese&#x27;s mastery in reflecting both the subtle foreshortening of the figures of Correggio and the heroism of those by Michelangelo.

===Villa Barbaro and refectory paintings===
By 1556, Veronese was commissioned to paint the first of his monumental banquet scenes, the &quot;Feast in the House of Simon&quot;, which would not be concluded until 1570. Owing to its scattered composition and lack of focus, however, it was not his most successful refectory mural. In the late 1550s, during a break in his work for San Sebastiano, Veronese decorated the Villa Barbaro in Maser, a newly finished building by the architect Andrea Palladio. The frescoes were designed to unite humanistic culture with Christian spirituality; wall paintings included portraits of the Barbaro family, and the ceilings opened to blue skies and mythological figures. Veronese&#x27;s decorations employed complex perspective and &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, and resulted in a luminescent and inspired visual poetry. The encounter between architect and artist was a triumph.
The &quot;Wedding at Cana&quot;, painted in 1562–1563, was also a collaboration with Palladio. It was commissioned by the Benedictine monks for the San Giorgio Maggiore Monastery, on the eponymous small island across from Saint Mark&#x27;s, in Venice. The contract insisted on the huge size (to cover 66 square meters), and that the pigment and colors should be of premium quality. For example, the contract specified that the blues should contain the precious mineral lapis-lazuli. The contract also specified that the painting should include as many figures as possible. There are a number of portraits (including those of Titian and Tintoretto, as well as a self-portrait of Veronese) staged upon a canvas surface nearly ten meters wide. The scene, taken from the New Testament Book of John, II, 1–11, represents the first miracle performed by Jesus, the making of wine from water, at a marriage in Cana, Galilee. The foreground celebration, a frieze of figures painted in the most shimmering finery, is flanked by two sets of stairs leading back to a terrace, Roman colonnades, and a brilliant sky.

In the refectory paintings, as in &quot;The Family of Darius before Alexander&quot; (1565–1570), Veronese arranged the architecture to run mostly parallel to the picture plane, accentuating the processional character of the composition. The artist&#x27;s decorative genius was to recognize that dramatic perspectival effects would have been tiresome in a living room or chapel, and that the narrative of the picture could best be absorbed as a colorful diversion. These paintings offer little in the representation of emotion; rather, they illustrate the carefully composed movement of their subjects along a primarily horizontal axis. Most of all they are about the incandescence of light and color. The exaltation of such visual effects may have been a reflection of the artist&#x27;s personal well-being, for in 1565 Veronese married Elena Badile, the daughter of his first master, and by whom he would eventually have a daughter and four sons.

Also painted between 1565 and 1570 is his &quot;Madonna and Child with St. Elizabeth, the Infant St. John the Baptist, and St. Justina&quot; (now in the Timken Museum of Art, San Diego). In this work St. Justina, a patroness of Padua and Venice, is at the right with the Blessed Virgin Mother and the Christ child in the center. In contrast to Italian works of a century earlier the infant is rendered convincingly as an infant. What makes one stop and take notice in this painting is the infant&#x27;s reaching out to St. Justina, since a baby of this age would normally limit his gaze to his mother. Completing the work is St. Elizabeth, the cousin of Mary and mother of St. John the Baptist, located on the left. The artist delicately balances the forms of the extended Holy Family and renders them using a superb balance of warm and cool colors.

===&quot;The Feast in the House of Levi&quot;===
In 1573 Veronese completed the commission for &quot;The Feast in the House of Levi&quot;, a last-supper painting for the rear wall of the refectory at the Basilica di Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Castello, Venice. Originally titled &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, the painting was to replace a Titian painting burnt in a fire; Veronese&#x27;s oversized (5.55m x 12.80m) replacement depicted a Last Supper banquet scene that included German soldiers, dwarves, and animals – the human and animal exotica usual to Veronese&#x27;s representational narratives. Artistically, &quot;The Feast in the House of Levi&quot; indicates Veronese&#x27;s technical development in using intense and luminous colors for texture, attention to narrative coherence, the acute representation of human emotion, and the psychologically subtle interplay occurring among the characters who crowd the scene.

Given the subject of the painting, the biblical Last Supper, the humanistic depictions of the characters lacked the piousness usual to Roman Catholic art depicting the Christ character and the events of his life; and the Inquisition readily noticed Veronese&#x27;s irreligiosity. By the 1570s, the theology of the Counter-Reformation had given legal authority to Roman Catholic doctrine in Venice, which was a new, political development for an artist such as Veronese. In the Venetian republic of the Late–Renaissance, for an artist, painting crowd scenes had acquired political ramifications regarding who and what appeared in a religious painting commissioned from him, regardless of the patron or patroness.

A decade earlier, the Benedictine monks who commissioned &quot;The Wedding at Cana&quot; (1563) had directed Veronese to freely include as many human figures as would fit in the banquet scene. In contrast, a decade later, Veronese encountered legal, religious constraints that determined the suitability (theological, political, sociological) of who and what he depicted in a painting—thus, on 18 July 1573, Veronese was summoned before the Venetian Holy Inquisition to explain the presence of what Church doctrine considered characters, animals, and indecorum extraneous to an image of the Last Supper of the Christ.

The tribunal&#x27;s interrogation of Veronese was cautionary, rather than punitive; political, rather than judicial; nonetheless, Veronese explained to the Inquisitiors that &quot;we painters take the same liberties as poets and madmen&quot; in telling a story. Although the Inquisition&#x27;s tribunal ordered Veronese to repaint the last-supper scene, he opposed their remedy to his theological offences, yet was compelled to re-title the painting from the sacramental &quot;The Last Supper&quot; to &quot;The Feast in the House of Levi&quot;. That an artist, such as Veronese, had successfully perdured against the Inquisition&#x27;s implied accusation of heresy, indicated he had the discreet political support of a patrician patron of the arts.

==Assessment==

An artist&#x27;s biography of Paolo Veronese was included in the second edition of the &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot; (1568), by Giorgio Vasari, with improved coverage of the painters of the Venetian school.

A fuller biography of Veronese had to await &quot;Le maraviglie dell&#x27;arte ovvero le vite degli illustri pittori Veneti e dello stato&quot; (1648), by Carlo Ridolfi, a compilation of the Venetian School painters. Ridolfi said that Veronese&#x27;s painting of &quot;The Feast in the House of Levi&quot; (1573) is &quot;by far, the most important source for our knowledge of his art&quot; because &quot;it gave rein to joy, made beauty majestic, made laughter, itself, more festive&quot;.

In 2014, the art historian Charles Hope wrote of Veronese&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses: &quot;He is notable above all as a colorist who used a range of bright hues with a boldness unmatched in his time and scarcely equaled since&quot;, but because his use of color &quot;was often calculated to create a harmonious overall effect rather than to single out the main protagonists&quot;, his paintings convey little narrative drama. According to Hope, &quot;the effect is sumptuous, seductive but ultimately excessive and a little monotonous, rather like a visit to a patisserie.&quot;

In &quot;Paintings in the Louvre&quot; (1987), Lawrence Gowing’s modern assessment of Paolo Veronese’s artistic achievement is that:

The French had no doubts, as the critic Théophile Gautier wrote in 1860, that Veronese was the greatest colorist who ever lived—greater than Titian, Rubens, or Rembrandt because he established the harmony of natural tones in place of the modeling in dark and light that remained the method of academic chiaroscuro. Delacroix wrote that Veronese made light without violent contrasts, &quot;which we are always told is impossible, and maintained the strength of hue in shadow&quot;.

This innovation could not be better described. Veronese’s bright outdoor harmonies enlightened and inspired the whole nineteenth century. He was the foundation of modern painting. But whether his style is in fact naturalistic, as the Impressionists thought, or a most subtle and beautiful imaginative invention must remain a question for each age to answer for itself.

==Working practices==
In addition to the ceiling creations and wall paintings, Veronese also produced altarpieces (&quot;The Consecration of Saint Nicholas&quot;, 1561–62, London&#x27;s National Gallery), paintings on mythological subjects (&quot;Venus and Mars&quot;, 1578, New York Metropolitan Museum of Art), and portraits (&quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot;, 1555, Louvre). A significant number of compositional sketches in pen, ink, and wash, figure studies in chalk, and chiaroscuro modelli and ricordi survive.

He headed a family workshop, including his younger brother Benedetto (1538–1598) as well as his sons Carlo and Gabriele, and his nephew Luigi Benfatto (also called dal Friso; 1559–1611), that remained active for a decade or so after his death in Venice in 1588, signing their work &quot;Haeredes Pauli&quot; (&quot;Heirs of Paolo&quot;), and continuing to use his drawings. According to Nicholas Penny, &quot;The role of the workshop seems to have increased steadily, and after 1580 it is rare that we can feel confident that Veronese&#x27;s was the sole hand involved&quot;. Among his pupils were his contemporary Giovanni Battista Zelotti and later, Giovanni Antonio Fasolo, Sigismondo de Stefani, and Anselmo Canneri. The Caliari family continued and another Paolo Caliari published the first monograph on his ancestor in 1888.

Veronese was one of the first painters whose drawings were sought by collectors during his lifetime.

<text>The Bharat Ratna (; ) is the highest civilian award of the Republic of India. Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is conferred in recognition of &quot;exceptional service/performance of the highest order&quot;, without distinction of race, occupation, position or gender. The award was originally limited to achievements in the arts, literature, science, and public services, but the Government of India expanded the criteria to include &quot;any field of human endeavor&quot; in December 2011. The recommendations for the award are made by the Prime Minister to the President. The recipients receive a &quot;Sanad&quot; (certificate) signed by the President and a peepal leaf-shaped medallion. Bharat Ratna recipients rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence.

The first recipients of the Bharat Ratna were: the former Governor-General of the Union of India C. Rajagopalachari, the former President of the Republic of India Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan; and the Indian physicist C. V. Raman, who were honoured in 1954. Since then, the award has been bestowed upon 53 individuals, including 18 who were awarded posthumously. The original statutes did not provide for posthumous awards but were amended in January 1966 to permit them to honor former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, the first individual to be honored posthumously. In 2014, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, then aged 40, became the youngest recipient, while social reformer Dhondo Keshav Karve was the oldest recipient when he was awarded on his 100th birthday. Though usually conferred on India-born citizens, the award has been conferred on one naturalized citizen, Mother Teresa, and on two non-Indians: Abdul Ghaffar Khan (born in British India and later a citizen of Pakistan) and Nelson Mandela, a citizen of South Africa.

The Bharat Ratna, along with other personal civil honours, was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980, during the change in the national government; and for a second time from August 1992 to December 1995, when several public-interest litigations challenged the constitutional validity of the awards. In 1992, the government&#x27;s decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhas Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had refused to accept the fact of his death, including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision, the press communique announcing Bose&#x27;s award was cancelled; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.

==History==
On 2 January 1954, a press communique was released from the office of the secretary to the President announcing the creation of two civilian awards—Bharat Ratna (&quot;Jewel of India&quot;), the highest civilian award, and the three-tier Padma Vibhushan, classified into &quot;Pehla Warg&quot; (Class I), &quot;Dusra Warg&quot; (Class II), and &quot;Tisra Warg&quot; (Class III), which rank below the Bharat Ratna. On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards; the Padma Vibhushan, the highest of the three, followed by the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri.

The award was briefly suspended twice in its history. The first suspension occurred when Morarji Desai, who was sworn in as the fourth Prime Minister in 1977, withdrew all personal civil honours on 13 July 1977. The suspension was rescinded on 25 January 1980, after Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister. The award was suspended again in mid-1992, when two Public-Interest Litigations were filed, one in the Kerala High Court and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court, challenging the &quot;constitutional validity&quot; of the awards. The awards were reintroduced by the Supreme Court in December 1995, following the conclusion of the litigation.

There is no formal provision that recipients of the Bharat Ratna should be Indian citizens. It has been awarded to a naturalised Indian citizen, Mother Teresa in 1980, and to two non-Indians, Abdul Ghaffar Khan of Pakistan in 1987 and the former South African president Nelson Mandela in 1990. Sachin Tendulkar, at the age of 40, became the youngest person and first sportsperson to receive the honour. Dhondo Keshav Karve was the oldest living recipient when he was awarded on his 100th birthday on 18 April 1958. , the award has been conferred upon 50 people with 15 posthumous declarations.

==Regulations==
The Bharat Ratna is conferred &quot;in recognition of exceptional service/performance of the highest order&quot;, without distinction of race, occupation, position, or gender. The award was originally confined to the arts, literature, science, and public services, as per the 1954 regulations. In December 2011, the rules were amended to &quot;any field of human endeavour&quot;. The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards, but this was subsequently modified in the January 1966 statute, and Lal Bahadur Shastri became the first recipient to be honored posthumously in 1966.

Although there is no formal nomination process, recommendations for the award can only be made by the Prime Minister to the President. The recipient receives a &quot;Sanad&quot; (certificate) signed by the President and a medallion without any monetary grant. Usage of the title &#x27;Bharat Ratna&#x27; as a prefix by the awardee is exempt from Article 18 (1) of the Constitution, as per the Supreme Court&#x27;s precedent in Balaji Raghavan/S.P. Anand v. Union of India in 1995. Additionally, recipients may either use the expression &quot;Awarded Bharat Ratna by the President&quot; or &quot;Recipient of Bharat Ratna Award&quot; to indicate that they have been honored with the award. The holders of the Bharat Ratna rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence.

As with many official announcements, recipients are announced and registered in &quot;The Gazette of India&quot;, a publication released by the Department of Publication, Ministry of Urban Development used for official government notices; without publication in the &quot;Gazette&quot;, conferral of the award is not considered official. Recipients whose awards have been revoked or restored, both of which require the authority of the President, are registered in the &quot;Gazette&quot;. Recipients whose awards have been revoked are required to surrender their medals, and their names are struck from the register.

==Specifications==

The original 1954 specifications of the award was a circle made of gold in diameter with a centered image of the sun on the obverse side. The text &quot;Bharat Ratna&quot;, in Devanagari Script, is inscribed on the upper edge in silver gilt with a wreath set along on the lower edge. A platinum State Emblem of India was placed in the center of the reverse side with the national motto, &quot;Satyameva Jayate&quot; in Devanagari Script (; lit. &quot;Truth alone triumphs&quot;), inscribed in silver-gilt on the lower edge.

A year later, the design was modified. The current medal is in the shape of a peepal leaf, approximately long, wide and thick and rimmed in platinum. The embossed sun burst design, made of platinum, on the obverse side of the medal has a diameter of with rays spreading out from to from the center of the Sun. The words &quot;Bharat Ratna&quot; on the obverse side remained the same as the 1954 design as did the emblem of India and &quot;Satyameva Jayate&quot; on the reverse side. A white ribbon is attached to the medal so it can be worn around the neck. In 1957, the silver-gilt decoration was changed to burnished bronze. The medals are minted at Alipore Mint in Kolkata.

== Entitlements ==
Bharat Ratna can not be used as a prefix or suffix, however recipients may identify themselves as &quot;Awarded Bharat Ratna by the President&quot; or &quot;Recipient of Bharat Ratna Award&quot;. The award does not carry any monetary benefits, but the award includes the following entitlements:

* The medallion and miniature
* A Sanad (certificate) signed by the President of India
* Treatment as a state guest by state governments when traveling within a state
* Indian missions abroad requested to facilitate recipients when requested
* Entitlement to a diplomatic passport
* Placed seventh in the Indian order of precedence
* Concessional fare on the flag carrier Air India

== Controversies and criticism ==
The Bharat Ratna has been mired in several controversies and award grants have been subject to multiple Public-Interest Litigations (PILs).

=== Subhas Chandra Bose (1992) ===
On 23 January 1992, a press release was published by the President&#x27;s secretariat to confer the award posthumously on Subhas Chandra Bose. The decision was contested in a public interest litigation, with the petitioner objecting to the conferral of the award and its posthumous mention of Bose, saying that honoring a personality higher than the award is &quot;ridiculous&quot;, and it was an act of &quot;carelessness&quot; to classify such a person with past and future recipients. It was also contested that the award cannot be conferred to Bose posthumously as the Government had not officially accepted his death on 18 August 1945. The petitioner requested the whereabouts of Bose from 18 August 1945 to date, based on the information collected by the 1956 Shah Nawaz Committee and the 1970 Khosla Commission. Bose&#x27;s family also declined to accept the award.

The Supreme Court formed a special two-judge division bench to adjudicate the case. The Solicitor General noted that to confer the award per the appropriate regulations pertaining to the Bharat Ratna, the name of the recipient must be published in &quot;The Gazette of India&quot; and entered in the recipients register maintained under the direction of the President. It was noted that only an announcement had been made by press communique, but the government had not proceeded to confer the award by publishing the name in the &quot;Gazette&quot; and entering the name in the register with the president having not conferred a &quot;Sanad&quot; (certificate). On 4 August 1997, the Supreme Court delivered an order that since the award had not been officially conferred, it cannot be revoked and declared that the press communique be treated as cancelled with the court declining to pass any judgement on the posthumous mention of Bose and his death.

=== Awards as &quot;titles&quot; (1992) ===
In 1992, two PILs were filed in the High Courts; one in the Kerala High Court on 13 February 1992 and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 24 August 1992. Both petitions questioned the civilian awards being &quot;Titles&quot; per an interpretation of of the Constitution. On 25 August 1992, the Madhya Pradesh High Court issued a notice temporarily suspending all civilian awards. A special five-judge division bench of the Supreme Court was formed, which restored the awards and delivered a judgement that the &quot;Bharat Ratna and Padma awards are not titles under Article 18 of the Constitution&quot; on 15 December 1995.

=== Rao and Tendulkar (2013) ===
Following the announcement, in November 2013, that C. N. R. Rao and Sachin Tendulkar were to be awarded the Bharat Ratna, multiple litigations were filed challenging the awards. The litigation against Tendulkar to the Election Commission indicated that the awarding him was a violation of the model code of conduct as Tendulkar was an Indian National Congress nominated member of Rajya Sabha and the decision to award him would influence the voters of five states where elections were underway at the time. On 4 December 2013, the Election Commission rejected the petition stating that conferring the award on people from non-polling states did not amount to a violation of the code.

Another litigation was filed against then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister Sushilkumar Shinde and sports minister Bhanwar Jitendra Singh for conferring of the award on Tendulkar, alleging an apparent &quot;conspiracy to ignore&quot; the famed Indian field hockey player Dhyan Chand. The litigation filed against Rao declared that other Indian scientists, such as Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai, had contributed more than Rao, his claim of publishing 1400 research papers was &quot;physically impossible&quot; and Rao had proven cases of plagiarism, hence the announcement should be annulled. The High Courts rejected all the petitions raised against Rao and Tendulkar.

===Criticism===

In 1977, the decision by then prime minister Indira Gandhi to posthumously honor former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu K. Kamaraj was criticized to have been aimed at placating the voters before the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1977. In 1988, the decision by then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi (1984–89) to confer the award posthumously on former chief minister of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran was criticized to have been aimed to influence voters prior to the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1989. The decision was also criticized for awarding Ramachandran before prominent independence activists B. R. Ambedkar and Vallabhbhai Patel, who were bestowed the honor later in 1990 and 1991 respectively. Later, then prime minister V.P. Singh was criticized for posthumously honoring B. R. Ambedkar, apparently in a bid to please the Dalit voters. Later, Ravi Shankar was accused of lobbying for the award.

The posthumous conferments of the award on the recipients who died before the Indian independence in 1947 or before the award was instituted in 1954, have been criticized by various authors and historians, stating that such conferments could lead to more demands to honor people like Maurya emperor Ashoka, Mughal emperor Akbar, Maratha emperor Shivaji, poet Rabindranath Tagore, Hindu spiritualist Swami Vivekananda, independence activist Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and &quot;father of the nation&quot; Mahatma Gandhi. In 1991, then prime minister P. V. Narasimha Rao was criticized for bestowing the award upon Sardar Patel in 1991, 41 years after his death in 1950; and upon Subhas Chandra Bose in 1992, who purportedly died in 1945. In 2015, the prime minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s decision to award Madan Mohan Malaviya, who died in 1946, close to the local body elections in Uttar Pradesh was also met with criticism.

A few of the conferments have been criticized for honoring personalities only after they received global recognition. The award for Mother Teresa was announced in 1980, a year after she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Satyajit Ray received an Academy Honorary Award in 1992 followed by the Bharat Ratna the same year. In 1999, Amartya Sen was awarded the Bharat Ratna, a year after his 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

Awarding of Bharat Ratna to L. K. Advani was also criticised. Editorials of Indian newspapers have observed that the BJP strategically uses the Bharat Ratna to integrate figures like L K Advani, balancing narratives around mandir (temple) and Mandal (social justice).

== Popular demands ==
Though, as per the statutes for the Bharat Ratna, the recommendations for the award can only be made by the Prime Minister to the President, there have been several demands from various political parties publicly to honor their leaders. In January 2008, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader L. K. Advani wrote to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recommending Singh&#x27;s predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the award. This was immediately followed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) lobbying for their leader, Jyoti Basu, former Chief Minister of West Bengal though Basu himself said that he would decline the honour, even if awarded. Similar demands were made by Telugu Desam Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, and Shiromani Akali Dal for their respective leaders N. T. Rama Rao, Kanshi Ram, and Parkash Singh Badal. In September 2015, regional political party Shiv Sena demanded the award for the independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar stating that he had been &quot;deliberately neglected by previous governments&quot; but his family clarified that they are not making such demand and that the freedom fighter is known for his contribution towards independence movement and did not need an award for recognition.

Per the original statutes, sports-persons were not eligible for the award; however, a revision of the rules in December 2011 made eligible &quot;any field of human endeavour&quot;. Subsequently, several sports-persons&#x27; names were discussed; amongst them were field-hockey player Dhyan Chand and former world chess champion Viswanathan Anand. In 2011, 82 members of parliament recommended Chand&#x27;s name for the award to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. In January 2012, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports forwarded his name again, this time along with 2008 Summer Olympics gold medallist shooter Abhinav Bindra and mountaineer Tenzing Norgay while Bindra had already been recommended for the award in May 2013 by the National Rifle Association of India. In July 2013, the ministry again recommended Dhyan Chand. However, in November 2013, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar became the first sports-person to receive the honour and this garnered much criticism for the government.

In 2012, a litigation was filed in the Karnataka High Court requesting the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi. On 27 January 2014, a counsel appearing for the petitioner noted that after multiple representations from the petitioner, they were provided with the information under RTI that the recommendations to confer the award on Gandhi have been received multiple times in the past and were forwarded to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. A Division bench consisting of the Chief Justice and another judge, dismissed the petition stating that the subject is not amenable to any adjudication process and the nominations and conferment process is stated to be informal and in the discretion of the highest authority in the Government.

<text>Carl Friedrich Christian Mohs ( , ; 29 January 1773 – 29 September 1839) was a German chemist and mineralogist. He was the creator of the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. Mohs also introduced a classification of the crystal forms in crystal systems independently of Christian Samuel Weiss.

== Early life and education ==
Mohs was born on 29 January 1773, in Gernrode, in the Harz mountains, Anhalt-Bernburg (present-day Saxony-Anhalt, Germany). He showed an interest in science at an early age and received private education before entering the University of Halle. There, Mohs studied chemistry, mathematics and physics. In 1798, he joined the Mining Academy in Freiberg, Saxony, being a student of Abraham Gottlob Werner.

== Career ==
After acquiring the job of a foreman at a mine in 1801, Mohs relocated in 1802 to Austria, where he was employed in trying to identify the minerals in a private collection of the banker J. F. van der Nüll. Mohs described this collection, and a catalogue was printed and published. In 1812 he relocated to Graz where he was employed by Archduke Johann in his newly established museum and academy of science, which was divided subsequently into the Joanneum and the Graz University of Technology. In 1818, Mohs was appointed successor of his former professor at the Freiberg Mining Academy, A. G. Werner, who died in 1817. In 1826 Mohs became full professor of mineralogy at the University of Vienna. At the same time he was assigned curator of the Imperial Mineralogical Collection, into which the van der Nüll collection of minerals was incorporated in 1827. In 1835, Mohs resigned. He became which meant being an imperial counselor in charge of mining affairs, published by orders from his department an instruction on mining, and was commissioned with the establishment of a montanistic museum in Vienna.

== Mineral properties ==

As part of this task, he started classifying minerals by their physical characteristics, instead of their chemical composition, as had been done traditionally. This emphasis on physical characteristics was at odds with the prevailing chemical systematics. However, both Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder had compared the relative hardness of minerals known to them during ancient times, including diamond and quartz. They knew that diamond could scratch quartz, so showing it to be harder. This became the basis of the hardness scale developed by Mohs. The hardest mineral, diamond, was given a value of 10 and softer minerals such as talc were given the value of 1. Other minerals were given values intermediate, depending on their ability to scratch another mineral in the scale. Thus gypsum was given the value 2 because it will scratch talc crystals, and calcite the value 3 because it will scratch gypsum. Minerals are also now classified by chemical characteristics, but the physical properties are still useful for field examination.

In 1812, Mohs became a professor in Graz. In 1818, Mohs was appointed professor at his alma mater in Freiberg. In 1826, Mohs was a professor in Vienna.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1816, Mohs settled in Vienna. Two years later, he relocated to Freiberg, Saxony. Mohs died during a journey to Agordo, Italy (then in the Austrian Lombardy–Venetia) in 1839, at the age of 66.

<text>A concert, often known informally as a gig or show, is a live performance of music in front of an audience. The performance may be carried by a single musician, in which case it is sometimes called a recital, or by a musical ensemble such as an orchestra, choir, or band. Concerts are held in a wide variety of settings and sizes, spanning from venues such as private houses and small nightclubs to mid-sized concert halls and finally to large arenas and stadiums, as well as outdoor venues such as amphitheatres and parks. Indoor concerts held in the largest venues are sometimes called arena concerts or amphitheatre concerts.

Regardless of the venue, musicians usually perform on a stage (if not an actual stage, then an area of the floor designated as such). Concerts often require live event support with professional audio equipment. Before recorded music, concerts provided the main opportunity to hear musicians play. For large concerts or concert tours, the challenging logistics of arranging the musicians, venue, equipment, audience, and tickets are handled by professional tour promoters.

== History ==
While the first concerts did not officially appear until the late 17th century, similar gatherings had been around throughout the 17th century at several European universities, such as Oxford and Cambridge. Officially, though, the first public concerts that required an admission were created by the English violinist John Banister. Over the next few centuries, concerts began to gain larger audiences, and classical symphonies were very popular. Finally, after World War 2, these events changed into the modern concerts that take place today. An example of an early, post-WW2 concert is the Moondog Coronation Ball.

=== 17th century ===

The first known occurrence of concerts where people are charged admission took place at violinist John Banister&#x27;s home in Whitefriars, London in 1672. 6 years later in 1678, a man by the name of Thomas Britton held weekly concerts in Clerkenwell. However, these concerts were different. Before, there was an admission that people paid upon entering the building where the concert was held, but at Britton&#x27;s concerts, patrons purchased a yearly subscription to come to the concerts. At 10 shillings a year, people could see as many concerts they wanted to.

In addition to holding concerts at certain venues, concerts also went to the people. In 17th century France, concerts were performed in the homes of the nobility, for only the nobility. Organized by Anne Danican Philidor, the first public concerts in France, and arguably the world, were the Concerts Spirituels. These concerts were held on religious holidays when the Opera was closed and served as a model for concert societies all over the world.

=== 18th century ===
In the late 18th century, music from the likes of Haydn and Mozart was brought and performed in English concerts. One notable work from Haydn performed at these concerts was his set of 12 symphonies, also referred to as the London Symphonies. Concerts reflecting the elegance of England during the time period were held at the gardens of Vauxhall, Ranelagh, and Marylebone. The musical repertoire performed at these events ranged from works composed by young Mozart, to songs that were popular in that time period.

==Types==

The nature of a concert varies by musical genre, individual performers, and the venue. Concerts by a small jazz combo or small bluegrass band may have the same order of program, mood, and volume—but vary in music and dress. In a similar way, a particular musician, band, or genre of music might attract concert attendees with similar dress, hairstyle, and behavior. For example, concert goers in the 1960s often had long hair (sometimes in dread lock form), sandals and inexpensive clothing made of natural fibers. Regular attendees to a concert venue might also have a recognizable style that comprises that venue&#x27;s scene.

===Recital===
A recital is a solo concerto, i.e. a concert by a soloist or small group which follows a program. It can highlight a single performer, sometimes accompanied by piano, or a performance of the works of a single composer, or a single instrument (organ recital). The invention of the solo piano recital has been attributed to Franz Liszt. Also, a recital may have many participants, as for a dance recital. A dance recital is a presentation of choreographed moves for an audience, usually in an established performing arts venue, possibly competitively. Some dance recitals are seasonal.

===Theatrical===

Some performers or groups put on very elaborate and expensive shows. To create a memorable and exciting atmosphere and increase the spectacle, performers frequently include additional entertainment devices. These can include elaborate stage lighting, electronic imagery via (IMAG) system and/or pre-recorded video, inflatable sets, artwork or other set pieces, various special effects such as theatrical smoke and fog and pyrotechnics, and unusual costumes or wardrobe. Some singers, especially popular music, augment concert sound with pre-recorded accompaniment, back-up dancers, and even broadcast vocal tracks of the singer&#x27;s own voice. Activities during these concerts can include dancing, sing-alongs, and moshing.

=== Classical ===
Classical concerts embody two different styles of classical music — orchestral and choral. They are performed by a plethora of different groups in concert halls or other performing art venues. For orchestra, depending on the number of performers and the instruments used, concerts include chamber music, chamber orchestra, or symphony orchestra. Chamber orchestra is a small-scale orchestra containing between ten and forty members, mostly string instruments, and likely led by a conductor. Symphony orchestra, on the other hand, is a large-scale orchestra that can have up to eighty or more members, which is led by a conductor and is performed with instruments such as strings, woodwinds, brass instruments, and percussion. For choral style pieces, concerts include Choral music, Opera, and musical theater. Each encompassing a variety of singers who are organized by a conductor or director.

===Rock===

Rock concerts are those where rock musicians perform in front of audiences which may vary from small to huge stadium concerts. Mosh pits are often a feature of modern rock concerts. Rock concerts are often conducted at extremely high volume levels, near the threshold of hearing loss.

== Venues ==

There are a wide variety of concert venues that can range in size, location, and the type of music that is hosted at that particular venue. A concert hall is a concert venue which hosts mainly classical music such as a symphony, and they are often a part of a larger performing arts center. One of the most famous concert halls is Royal Albert Hall located in the United Kingdom. This venue hosts a wide variety of genres of music from classical concerts to pop concerts. An amphitheater is an uncovered circular or oval-shaped venue with tiers of seats surrounding the stage. Amphitheaters such as the well-known Red Rocks Amphitheatre, located in Colorado, hosts mainly rock and pop concerts. Rock and pop concerts, however, are mainly held in sports stadiums and arenas such as Madison Square Garden because of the tendency for these stadiums to have a larger capacity.

==Formats==

===Festivals===


Concerts involving a greater number of artists, especially those that last for multiple days, are known as festivals. Unlike other concerts, which typically remain in a single genre of music or work of a particular artist, festivals often cover a broad scope of music and arts. Due to their size, festivals are almost exclusively held outdoors. New platforms for festivals are becoming increasingly popular such as Jam Cruise, which is a festival held on a cruise ship, as well as Mayan Holidaze, which is a destination festival held in Tulum.

===Tour===
A concert tour is a series of concerts by an artist or group of artists in different cities, countries, or locations. Often concert tours are named, to differentiate different tours by the same artist and associate a specific tour with a particular album or product. Especially in the popular music world, such tours can become large-scale enterprises that last for several months or even years, are seen by hundreds of thousands or millions of people, and bring in millions of dollars, or the equivalent, in ticket revenues.

===Residency===

A concert residency or musical residency is a series of live music concerts similar to a concert tour, but only performed at one location. One will have fewer shows than a concert tour. Theaters generally serve as the venues for them. Concert residencies are usually associated with the city of Las Vegas. Bands and individuals might embark on one since it&#x27;s easier than touring. Examples of concert residencies are and Play by Britney Spears and Katy Perry, respectively.

==Revenue ==

While admission to some concerts is free, it is common practice to charge money for concerts by selling admission tickets. Before the advent of recorded-music sales and mechanical royalties in the early 20th century, concerts were the primary source of revenue for musicians. Revenue from ticket sales typically goes to the performing artists, producers, venue, organizers and the brokers. In the case of benefit concerts, a portion of profits often go towards a charitable organization.

Additional revenue is also often raised through in-concert advertising, from free local concerts for local sponsorships to sponsorships from corporations during major tours e.g. 2009&#x27;s &quot;Vans&#x27; Warped Tour Presented by AT&amp;T&quot;. Both Vans and AT&amp;T would have paid significant amounts to have their company names included at the forefront in all marketing material for the Warped Tour.

Concessions and merchandise are also often sold during and after concerts; often by the venue in the case of the former, and by the performing band or artist in the case of the latter.

The global live music industry revenue stood at 28.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2023. Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour in 2023 was record-breaking, generating $1.04 billion in revenue, averaging $17.3 million per show.

==Attendance==
The term &quot;full house&quot; is used to designate full occupancy by the audience of every seat or place at a venue. It also applies to theatrical productions and cinemas.

, Italian singer Vasco Rossi holds the record for the biggest attendance of a ticketed concert with a total of 220,000 tickets sold for his show at Enzo Ferrari Park, Modena, Italy on 1 July 2017. The record was previously held by Paul McCartney&#x27;s 1990 concert with a paying audience of 185,000 in Maracanã Stadium, Rio de Janeiro. Rod Stewart also holds the record for the biggest attendance in a free concert, with an estimated audience of 3.5 million during his 1994 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro.

==Concert psychology==
Many musicians performing in large venues or to a mass audience through electronic media experience stage fright or performance anxiety. The psychological stress of maintaining performance at a high level over a long concert tour is associated with depression and substance abuse.

In some concert settings, such as classical music, the audience participates passively. In other concert settings, especially folk or rock concerts, the performers encourage and engage with an active audience response. The intensity of the sound environment and the crush of the mass audience can induce a trance-like psychological state in some audience members, and beyond the music itself, functions as an entry point to achieve an altered state of consciousness. Vocalists and other musicians (if their instrument permits this) will often dance or strut on stage as they perform, and the audience will often dance or sway in response (space permitting); this can also be considered a manifestation of crowd psychology.

<text>Human Action: A Treatise on Economics is a work by the Austrian economist and philosopher Ludwig von Mises. Widely considered Mises&#x27; &quot;magnum opus&quot;, it presents the case for laissez-faire capitalism based on praxeology, his method to understand the structure of human decision-making. Mises rejected positivism within economics, and defended an &quot;a priori&quot; foundation for praxeology, as well as methodological individualism and laws of self-evident certainty. Mises argues that the free-market economy not only outdistances any government-planned system, but ultimately serves as the foundation of civilization itself.

&quot;Nationalökonomie: Theorie des Handelns und Wirtschaftens&quot; is the 1940 German-language predecessor to &quot;Human Action&quot;.

Mises argues that market-generated money prices are essential to determine the most highly valued uses for resources to satisfy consumer demands. He attempts to demonstrate the inconsistencies of piecemeal political intervention in the market economy and the pernicious effects of political control and manipulation of the monetary system. In Mises&#x27;s view, government interventions that distort market prices always result in misdirections of resources, including labor, and malinvestments of capital, leading to inflationary upswings followed by inevitable economic downturns. Mises believed that the market economy was the only system that provided freedom and personal choice to all members of society while generating the means for coordinating the actions of billions of people in the most economically rational manner, and that monetary manipulation by central banks was one of the most disruptive distortions to the process of economic calculation.

==Summary==
In his Introduction, Mises argues that economics emerged as a science when a regularity in the sequence and interdependence of market phenomena was discovered. He notes the challenges faced by economics as a new science, particularly in being accepted as a legitimate branch of knowledge, and discusses various schools of thought that rejected the achievements of economic thought. Mises refutes common criticisms against economics, stating that the ideas of classical economists have improved the general standard of living by promoting liberal policies and technological improvement. He also argues that economic problems cannot be isolated as they are just a segment of a general science of human action.

=== Part One: Human Action ===
Chapter 1, &quot;Acting Man&quot;, explains the concept of human action, which is defined as&quot;purposeful behavior&quot; and distinguished from reflexive behavior in that an observer imputes a goal to the actor. Praxeology is the science of action as such, which studies the results deduced from the fact that people have goals and adopt means to achieve them. For an action to occur, the actor must be in a state of unease, imagine a more satisfactory state, and believe that purposeful behavior can reduce the uneasiness. The text addresses the concept of happiness and instinct, where happiness is defined entirely by the subjective goals of the individual actor, and humans can suppress their biological urges. The study of human action begins with the ultimate given of human action itself, and all studies of human actions must rely on methodological dualism. Praxeology is subjective, as it takes actors&#x27; subjective ends as they exist in the minds of each person, but by refraining from passing judgment on these ends, it remains objective. Causality is necessary for action, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle does not alter this. Finally, the text introduces the concept of the alter ego, where all events must fall in the realm of teleology or causality.

Chapter 2, &quot;The Epistemological Problems of the Sciences of Human Action&quot;, is about the sciences of human action, praxeology, and history. &quot;History is the collection and systematic arrangement of all the data of experience concerning human action.&quot; Praxeology, on the other hand, starts from the fact of human action and uses logical deduction to arrive at a priori truths that are valid for all action, both in the past and future. The principles of causality and teleology are also necessary prerequisites for the mind to make sense of the world. The text emphasizes that praxeology concerns the actions of individuals and deals with individual actions, not vague action in general. The historian can rely on other disciplines but must use his prior value judgments and theories to determine what is relevant and then present the facts accordingly. The limitations on praxeological concepts are also discussed.

Chapter 3, &quot;Economics and the Revolt Against Reason&quot;, discusses the topic of polylogism, which is the belief that different groups of people, such as different races or social classes, have fundamentally different ways of thinking and reasoning. Mises argues that this idea is not supported by evidence and is instead used as a way to discredit opponents&#x27; arguments without actually addressing them. He also emphasizes the importance of reason as the primary tool for acting humans and warns against rejecting it in favor of instinct, which would be detrimental to civilization.

Chapter 4, &quot;A First Analysis of the Category of Action&quot;, discusses the concept of ends and means, where the end is the result sought by an actor and the means are used to attain the end. Praxeology analyzes an actor&#x27;s goals and beliefs to explain market phenomena. The distinction between free goods and economic goods is unhelpful, and goods are classified as consumers&#x27; goods or producers&#x27; goods based on their direct or indirect satisfaction of human wants. Value resides in the minds of actors who rank objects according to their desirability. Economics can be built on the subjective scale of values possessed by actual individuals. All actions are voluntary exchanges where the cost of an action is the value of the price paid and the forgone satisfaction. Profit is a subjective category that is immeasurable, and actors are fallible.

Chapter 5, &quot;Time&quot;, discusses the temporal character of praxeology, the study of human action. While praxeology is a logical system, it is intimately related to time, as action is what makes man aware of the flux of time. The present is not defined as a unit of duration but rather as the presence of a ripe opportunity to take potential action. Time is scarce, and must be economized even in a hypothetical paradise where all material needs are met. Actions must occur in succession through time, and it is the action itself that is the brute fact, not an underlying value scale. It is pointless to judge the actions of individuals with reference to their value scales.

Chapter 6, &quot;Uncertainty&quot;, discusses uncertainty and probability in human action. Action implies uncertainty because if the future were known, there would be no impetus to act. The problem of probable inference, reaching a decision in the face of incomplete knowledge, is a broad one that cuts across many disciplines. There are two fields of probability, class and case probability, with the former applicable to natural sciences and the latter applicable to social sciences. In class probability, we know everything about the entire class of events or phenomena, but we know nothing particular about the individuals making up the class. Case probability is applicable when we know some factors that will affect a particular event, but we are ignorant of other factors that will also influence the outcome. Betting is when a man risks money on an outcome where he knows some of the factors involved, while gambling is when he risks money on an outcome where he knows only the frequencies of the various elements of the class. Praxeology can make certain qualitative predictions about the future, but quantitative forecasts are not certain.

Chapter 7, &quot;Action Within the World&quot;, covers several topics related to economics and human action, including the law of marginal utility, the law of returns, human labor as a means, and production. The law of marginal utility refers to the fact that the utility of successive units of a given good decreases, as the actor will apply the additional units to less and less urgent ends. Marginal utility is always defined according to the subjective framework of the actor in question. The law of returns describes the quantitative causal relations of the world, specifically in relation to producer goods. A given unit of a producer good must always act in combination with at least one other producer good to yield a definite quantity of a consumer good. At some finite point, an &quot;optimum&quot; level will be reached, and the quantity of output per unit of input will be maximized. Human labor as a means carries disutility, meaning that actors will not devote the physiological-maximum amount of labor to achieve attainable ends. The disutility of labor increases as the supply of leisure shrinks. Labor is the ultimate &quot;nonspecific&quot; factor and is required in every production process. Production is not creative but rather combines various inputs to produce a good or service. The creative genius is an exception to this, as they do not labor for immediate or mediate gratification.

=== Part Two: Action Within the Framework of Society ===
Chapter 8, &quot;Human Society&quot;, discusses various aspects of human cooperation, including the benefits of the division of labor, the superiority of social cooperation, the critiques of the metaphysical view of society, and the Ricardian Law of Association. The text also talks about the effects of the division of labor on society, the emergence of man as a social being, and the Great Society. Finally, the text addresses the instinct of aggression and destruction and how it has been overcome by social cooperation.

Chapter 9, &quot;The Role of Ideas&quot;, discusses several topics related to human action and ideology. Firstly, human action is distinguished by reasoning, and while reasoning may be faulty, it is always the individual who thinks, and tradition and language allow present actors to incorporate their ancestors&#x27; reasoning into their own thinking. Secondly, a worldview serves as both an interpretation of all things and a guide to action, while ideology is more restricted to human interaction over earthly concerns. Despite their incompatibility on the surface, various ideologies champion the same things for their followers, and their disagreements are not over abstract principles. Thirdly, might is the power to direct the actions of others, and society is a product of ideology. Lastly, the notions of progress and retrogression only make sense in the context of an actor&#x27;s plan, and the fatal flaw of 18th- and 19th-century rationalists and (classical) liberals was their faith in the decency and wisdom of the common man.

Chapter 10, &quot;Exchange Within Society&quot;, discusses the concepts of autistic exchange, which concerns only one actor, and interpersonal exchange, which involves cooperation between two or more individuals. People can cooperate in either a contractual or hegemonic relationship, with contractual societies being more peaceful than hegemonic ones. All action involves the use of ordinal numbers to rank possible outcomes, but the use of cardinal numbers requires special conditions and developed in the context of a contractual society. The ability to apply arithmetic to various fields is crucial for modern civilization, and economics itself can be described as a theory of human action that relies on calculation.

=== Part Three: Economic Calculation ===
Chapter 11, &quot;Valuation Without Calculation&quot;, discusses the gradation of means and how actors value means based on the ends they can achieve. Mises explains that actors must choose between various outcomes that all consist of countable supplies of different goods, and that the fundamental act of choice always involves a purely ordinal value judgment. Mises also discusses the imaginary construction of the barter economy and the role of money. Historically, economists believed that money was neutral and served only to facilitate &quot;real&quot; transactions, and that items exchanged in a market were of equal value. However, the modern subjective theory of value starts with the realization that people trade goods precisely because they value them differently. Mises then delves into the problem of economic calculation, explaining that technology alone cannot solve the problem because each means of production is more or less suitable for a wide range of ends, and thus each means is substitutable for others but to varying degrees, depending on the task. Only money prices can solve the problem of economic calculation. Finally, Mises discusses the relationship between economic calculation and the market, explaining that money prices established in a market are not measurements of value, but rather historical facts that provide a guide to future action. Without them, all of the subsidiary concepts in accounting would be metaphorical.

Chapter 12, &quot;The Sphere of Economic Calculation&quot;, discusses the nature of economic calculation and its limitations. Economic calculation is used to make decisions based on monetary values, but it cannot account for things that do not exchange for money. Prices are in constant flux and cannot be stabilized. Attempts to stabilize the purchasing power of money suffer from difficulties such as the fact that prices consist of money and there is no immutable unit of value. The popularity of the idea of stabilization comes from the desire for a secure arena outside the uncertainty of the market. Historically, moneys that originated on the market, such as gold and silver, were adequate for economic calculation, but government inflations changed this.

Chapter 13, &quot;Monetary Calculation as a Tool of Action&quot;, discusses monetary calculation as a guiding principle of action in societies with a division of labor. Monetary calculation evaluates potential actions based on expected costs and revenues and past actions with the accounting of profit and loss. However, monetary calculation requires private property in the means of production and a universally accepted medium of exchange (i.e., money) to function. Capitalism is inextricably linked to monetary calculation, as the notion of capital depends on summing the market prices of the resources available for a project. Praxeology and economics were developed based on historical evolution of economic calculation, as only with money prices and related concepts could patterns in commercial activity be noticed.

=== Part Four: Catallactics or Economics of the Market Society ===
Chapter 14, &quot;The Scope and Method of Catallactics&quot;, focuses on the science of human action or praxeology, which studies goal-seeking, rational behavior. The chapter describes the delimitation of catallactic problems, which involve analyzing the formation of money prices for all goods and services exchanged on a market. The chapter also explains the use of imaginary constructions as the method of praxeology and the analysis of the pure market economy. Other topics covered in the chapter include the autistic economy, the state of rest, and the evenly rotating economy. Finally, the chapter also discusses the stationary economy and its relationship with profit and interest.

Chapter 15, &quot;The Market&quot;, focuses on the characteristics of the market economy, capital, capitalism, the sovereignty of consumers, competition, freedom, and inequality of wealth and income. In the market economy, individuals specialize in their occupations, and the means of production are privately owned. Economic calculation is based on the notions of capital and income, and capital goods refer to physical objects that can be used to augment future production. History shows that private property goes hand in hand with civilization, and although the market economy has never existed in a pure form, it has grown in Western civilizations since the Middle Ages. Even though entrepreneurs appear to be in charge, consumers are sovereign, and their purchasing decisions determine which businesses expand and which contract. Competition entrusts control of scarce resources to those who are most likely to satisfy the wants of consumers, and the true restrictions on competition come from government, not the market. Freedom and liberty are the most precious goods to many thinkers in the Western tradition, and people are not born equal.

Chapter 16, &quot;Prices&quot;, covers the pricing process, valuation and appraisement, the prices of goods of higher orders, cost accounting, and logical catallactics versus mathematical catallactics. The pricing process in an organized market is determined by the subjective valuations of consumers and entrepreneurs, who appraise goods to make buying decisions that cause price formation. Appraisement is an objective assessment of an item&#x27;s market value, which may differ from a person&#x27;s subjective valuation. Entrepreneurs evaluate factors of production based on their appraisal of the products that these factors can create, which determines the prices of second- and higher-order goods. Cost accounting is the process of evaluating the costs of production to determine how to create products and earn revenue that will cover the entrepreneur&#x27;s explicit costs. Mises argues that mathematical models of pricing are flawed because they ignore the market process, which is necessary for understanding the formation of real-world prices.

Then, several topics related to monopoly are discussed. A monopolist violates consumer sovereignty when they restrict output below the competitive level. Good will, or a producer&#x27;s reputation, gives them an advantage over competitors who lack it, and government certification is not an effective solution to asymmetric information. Monopolistic buyers can restrict demand, but they cannot earn a specific gain like monopolistic sellers can. Monopoly prices generally impair consumer happiness, except when a product would not be produced without monopoly prices for an essential input. Price discrimination can occur on the part of both sellers and buyers, but it can only happen under certain conditions and may not persist on a free market. Government privileges, not free markets, establish most cartels and monopolies.

Finally, there are several topics discussed regarding the connexity of prices. The prices of goods are related because they compete for the money of buyers, and labor is required for every good, making them interrelated on both the consumption and production side. The market process does not engage in separate activities of price and income determination, as the exchange ratios in specific transactions determine both. The market process directs the factors of production into those lines that best satisfy the desires of the consumers. It is nonsense to speak of non-market prices because market prices take into account all relevant facts. Any attempt to alter prices would ignore these real considerations, which would ultimately make consumers poorer.

Chapter 17, &quot;Indirect Exchange&quot;, discusses the concept of money and the errors associated with it. Indirect exchange requires a medium of exchange, where a good or commodity is used to facilitate a more ultimate exchange. When one good becomes the commonly used medium of exchange, it becomes money. The &quot;equation of exchange&quot; is a faulty method of analyzing money because it assumes that the level of prices and total output are meaningful concepts, leading to the flawed notion of the neutrality of money. The purchasing power of money is explained by the difference in marketability of various goods, and the demand for money depends on its exchange value. Carl Menger&#x27;s theory of the spontaneous origin of money states that money emerged naturally from direct exchange, as people increased their demand for marketable goods. Finally, the price of money depends on its exchange value in the market and its industrial and monetary demand.

Changes in the purchasing power of money can arise from the money side or the real side, but typically changes in the purchasing power of money can only occur from the money side. Changes originating from the money side can only redistribute wealth and cannot make the community richer. Businessmen must decide upon a money in which to reckon for economic calculation purposes. If people expect the purchasing power of money to change, they will adjust their cash holdings accordingly and speed up the process, which may result in the abandonment of the currency causing the &quot;crackup boom&quot; (Katastrophenhausse). Money substitutes perform all the services of money and become a money substitute if there is a claim to a definite amount of money, payable and redeemable on demand, such that no one doubts the solvency of the debtor. If the debtor has issued more money substitutes than it can redeem with money proper, then the &quot;unbacked&quot; portion of the claims become fiduciary media. The limit to the issuance of fiduciary media is that if the issuance proceeds so rapidly that the public becomes suspicious, they will turn in the claims and demand redemption in actual money.

Mises discusses various topics related to money, trade, and inflation. People decide on the appropriate size of cash holdings based on subjective marginal utility, and it is possible to hold too much cash. The balance of payments is the record of the money equivalent of the incomings and outgoings of an individual or group during a specific period of time, and a trade &quot;deficit&quot; is not an unforeseen calamity but rather the cumulative outcome of deliberate transactions undertaken by each individual. Exchange rates between currencies are kept within narrow limits due to arbitrage opportunities. Credit transactions carried out in the same currency tend to yield the same interest rates for comparable credit risks, and secondary media of exchange are goods that are still quite marketable but not as much as the money good. In a market economy free from government expansion of the money supply, prices would generally fall over time, and the gold standard marked the hallmark of classical liberalism. International monetary cooperation is not necessary for an international gold standard to work.

Chapter 18, &quot;Action in the Passing of Time&quot;, covers the topic of time and its role in human action. It explains how all actions are directed towards the improvement of future conditions, but people do not value fractions of time equally. The text covers different concepts of time, including maturing time, working time, period of production, and duration of serviceableness. It emphasizes that time preference is essential to action and implies that present goods are more valuable than future goods, if the only difference is their date of availability. The text also discusses capital goods, which are factors of production that have been produced, and how lengthening the period of production requires savings. The structure of production is complex, and monetary profit-and-loss calculation helps determine if capital is growing or shrinking. Mises explains the concepts of period of production, waiting time, and period of provision, emphasizing that action is always forward-looking.

According to Mises, capital refers to physical capital goods and their degree of convertibility, and even cash is not a completely free form of capital. He believes that the market economy cannot be judged based on hindsight because the limited convertibility of capital goods is what prevents the adoption of more productive arrangements. Maintaining or increasing capital, for Mises, means maintaining or increasing the productivity of future efforts at want satisfaction, which can only be accomplished through saving. Capital consumption occurs when the consumption takes such a large portion of current output that the remainder devoted to new capital goods is insufficient to replace the depreciation of the capital stock. The transactions of the stock market, according to Mises, do not alter the sum total of profits or losses, but merely the particular people on whom the profits or losses fall, which shows the pointlessness of foreign-exchange controls. He explains that entrepreneurs hold cash balances, and saving and investment are necessary for accumulating additional capital.

Chapter 19, &quot;The Rate of Interest&quot;, explains the phenomenon of interest. Originary interest is the discount applied to future goods versus present goods, and is ultimately due to the universal phenomenon of time preference. It explains the higher market price for present goods versus future goods. Interest income is not just earned by the owners of capital goods but also by the owners of land. The rate of interest is not determined in the loan market but is determined by people&#x27;s subjective time preferences. A higher interest rate does not necessarily draw forth more savings, rather, the discount people place on future goods determines both the amount of saving and the height of interest rates. The supply of capital goods bears no necessary relationship with the rate of interest. Lastly, the excess of gross revenues over total money expenditures is not just profit, but it is the implicit wages for the entrepreneur, interest on the capital invested, and true entrepreneurial profit or loss.

Chapter 20, &quot;Interest, Credit Expansion, and the Trade Cycle&quot;, discusses the neutral rate of interest and the problems associated with it. It explains that the neutral rate of interest is the hypothetical, single rate of originary interest that would prevail in an imaginary, perfectly competitive economy. However, in the real world, there are different implicit rates of interest in various lines of production, due to people&#x27;s inability to perfectly forecast the future. The chapter also discusses the credit expansion, which is responsible for the business cycle. It explains that the actual gross rate of interest quoted in a loan contract reflects not only the pure rate of originary interest, but also an entrepreneurial component and a price premium component. The chapter further explains that the market process tends to equalize the net rates of interest in various lines, bringing them all into conformity with the originary rate of interest. The crucial function of the market interest rate is to coordinate the duration of production processes. If the gross market rate of interest is distorted due to changes in the money supply, it may mislead entrepreneurs.

Then, there is a discussion on credit expansion and contraction, as well as the monetary theory of the trade cycle. In credit expansion, the government artificially increases the money supply by lowering interest rates, which leads to a boom period with malinvestments, and ultimately to a bust phase. In credit contraction, the government artificially reduces the money supply by increasing interest rates, which leads to lower prices but has no lasting ill effects. The Currency School made mistakes in only analyzing the cycle in terms of one country&#x27;s banking sector and missing the issue of the deviation of the market rate of interest from the originary rate. Theories of the boom-bust cycle that rely on &quot;real&quot; factors still assume that there is a credit expansion necessary for a boom and bust. Finally, the depression is the necessary readjustment phase to correct the malinvestments that occurred during the boom.

Chapter 21, &quot;Work and Wages&quot;, distinguishes between two types of labor, &quot;introversive&quot; labor and &quot;extroversive&quot; labor, and identifies four reasons why people undertake labor, which may include building strength, religious duty, and avoiding mischief. The author discusses the psychological experiences of joy and tedium associated with labor, and how these experiences do not affect the disutility of labor. The text also explores the determination of wages through competition in the labor market, where wage rates are determined by the marginal productivity of labor. Mises discusses the concept of catallactic unemployment, where workers remain unemployed due to their perception of available working opportunities.

Then, Mises discusses various topics related to wages, subsistence, and the labor market. The classical economists explained wage rates as being determined by the bare subsistence requirements of workers, but this &quot;iron law of wages&quot; was false, as the standard of living of the average worker continued to grow under capitalism. The Marxist and Prussian Historical Schools explained modern wage rates as directly caused by historical precedent rather than current valuations. Under capitalism, the accumulation of capital has proceeded more quickly than the increase in population, so that the marginal product of the worker has risen over time, allowing for an increase in real wage rates. The popular interpretation of the &quot;Industrial Revolution&quot; as being exploitative and requiring pro-labor reforms is a myth. Finally, the labor market is affected by changes in market data, and wage rates are equal to the price of the &quot;full produce of labor.&quot;

Chapter 22, &quot;The Nonhuman Original Factors of Production&quot;, discusses the theory of rent and land use. The classical trichotomy of land, labor, and capital is shown to be untenable, and modern economics uses a single theoretical framework to explain the prices of each productive factor. The distinction between original and produced means of production is retained, and the use of nonhuman factors of production depends on institutional factors. The quantity of available land is so large that submarginal land is not brought into cultivation at all, and some land must be withdrawn from agricultural or other &quot;productive&quot; uses to be used as the foundation for homes, office buildings, factories, etc. The price of a piece of land is equal to the sum of its future rents, discounted by the rate of interest. The romanticized notion of land as a noble source of livelihood is discredited, as actual peasants view land as a means for the satisfaction of wants.

Chapter 23, &quot;The Data of the Market&quot;, discusses various topics related to economics. Praxeology deals with human action and its theorems are exact as long as the conditions are present. Economics does not assume that man is free, but rather deals with the fact of scarcity and the role of coercion in people&#x27;s behavior in the marketplace. Theorems of catallactics apply to private ownership of the means of production, and division of labor. The real man and his actions are the focus of economics, not economic man or a statistically average man. The market adjusts to changes in data, but entrepreneurs must anticipate the rate of adjustment. Cases of external costs reflect loopholes in the legal system rather than flaws in private property. Legal restrictions on the market may lead to monopoly gains or differential rents.

Chapter 24, &quot;Harmony and Conflict of interests&quot;, argues that one man&#x27;s profit is not necessarily another man&#x27;s loss, and that entrepreneurial profits are earned by better adjusting production to satisfy consumer desires. Mises also discusses how the limitation of offspring is necessary for maintaining higher standards of living and that private property is essential to the market economy. He emphasizes that there is a harmony of interests among all people and that conflicts only arise due to government interference in the market. Finally, he claims that war and conflicts are caused by government interference and that respecting private property is the liberal solution to these issues.

=== Part Five: Social Cooperation Without a Market ===
Chapter 25, &quot;The Imaginary Construction of a Socialist Society&quot;, discusses the historical origins of the socialist idea, which emerged from classical liberal writers&#x27; depiction of an all-powerful and benevolent king who could achieve socially beneficial outcomes similar to those of a market economy. With the rise of modern industry, the call for equal redistribution of property became impractical, and the idea of socialization of the means of production arose, with the state handling all economic affairs. Karl Marx did not invent socialist doctrine but contributed to it with the idea of polylogism and the inevitability of socialism. The socialist creed rests upon three dogmas: society is an omnipotent and omniscient being, the coming of socialism is inevitable, and history is a continuous progress towards socialism. The crucial feature of socialism is that all productive activities are directed by one will. The praxeological critique of socialism is not over the choice of ends, but whether socialism can effectively allocate resources to achieve the most desirable outcome from the dictator&#x27;s point of view.

Chapter 26, &quot;The Impossibility of Economic Calculation Under Socialism&quot;, discusses what Mises considers the central problem of socialism. The lack of economic calculation in socialism means that planners cannot compare the benefits and costs of different uses of scarce resources, making planning impossible. The failure to conceive of this problem is attributed to the focus of mathematical economists on static-equilibrium states in their formal models, which do not require entrepreneurship and can be achieved without the use of money. The schemes proposed by socialist theorists to address the problem of economic calculation, such as valuing goods based on their inherent labor content or units of &quot;utility,&quot; are argued to be untenable. The absence of a market test of profit and loss in socialism means that the planner cannot resort to trial and error. The recent proposals for &quot;market socialism,&quot; which suggest that planners give instructions to plant managers to behave &quot;as if&quot; they were in a market economy, are also argued to be untenable. The differential equations of mathematical economics do not provide guidance for how the planner should move toward the desired end state while maintaining a satisfactory condition during the transition phase.

=== Part Six: The Hampered Market Economy ===
Chapter 27, &quot;The Government and the Market&quot;, discusses the idea of a third economic system that is neither pure capitalism nor pure socialism. He explains that there are two patterns for the realization of socialism, the Lenin/Russian pattern where all enterprises are nationalized, and the Hindenburg/German pattern where the appearance of a market is retained but all activity is directed by the central authority. Mises argues that the purpose of government is to ensure the smooth operation of the market economy by enforcing property rights and that direct government interference with consumption choices can be analyzed by economics. He also explains that the concept of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; does not mean doing nothing in the face of unsatisfactory social conditions, but rather it is about allowing individuals the freedom to plan their own lives versus granting all power to the government. Finally, Mises suggests that a voluntary system based on ethical or religious ideals could be a possible social arrangement, but specific guidelines would be needed to ensure its success.

Chapter 28, &quot;Interference by Taxation&quot;, discusses taxation and its effects on the market. Mises argues that the goal of neutral taxation, where prices are not disturbed by the system of taxation, is unachievable as every system of taxation will affect market prices to a greater or lesser extent. The chapter also explores the concept of a total tax, where the government confiscates all income or wealth and redistributes it back to its subjects, and the fiscal and nonfiscal objectives of taxation, which can sometimes be in conflict. Finally, the various methods of taxation are classified into three groups, with the third class being a vehicle for the achievement of socialism, and will be discussed in later chapters.

Chapter 29, &quot;Restriction of Production&quot;, discusses government restrictions on the free market and their impact on production and consumption. Such restrictions inevitably make people poorer and alter the pattern of production. While it is possible that some restrictions may be justified if their benefits outweigh their costs, typically government restrictions fail to achieve their stated purpose, and are unjustified. Despite making the entire nation poorer, each restriction can bestow benefits on a subset of the population, which makes it politically difficult to remove them. Restrictions can also be used to shield domestic industries from the immediate consequences of regulations. It is possible that some restrictions may be justified, but they should be classified as quasi-consumption, not production. Measures like maximum workweeks and other &quot;prolabor&quot; laws are part of a quasi-consumption program and do not raise standards of living.

Chapter 30, &quot;Interference with the Structure of Prices&quot;, discusses government interference in the market and its effects. Price controls, such as ceilings or floors, cause shortages or surpluses in the market and interfere with the equilibrium between supply and demand. They also alter the structure of production, leading to the opposite effect of what was intended. Minimum wage rates and labor union violence also affect the market, as they raise wages for some workers, but reduce wages in other sectors. Ultimately, the only way to raise wages is to increase capital per worker, which labor unions have historically opposed. Finally, the text presents a historical example of how price controls contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire.

Chapter 31, &quot;Currency and Credit Manipulation&quot;, discusses government intervention in currency, including legal tender laws and currency manipulation. Governments historically certified the weight and fineness of coins used as money, but many abused this privilege by debasing the coins and forcing people to accept them as legitimate. The international gold standard emerged as a result of classical liberalism, but governments sometimes used legal-tender laws to relieve the plight of debtors, which led to monetary inflation. This interventionism did not provide long-term relief for debtors and often resulted in higher gross interest rates and breakdowns in the credit system. Under a metallic currency, governments could not easily manipulate currency because attempts at debasement would lead to the effects described by Gresham&#x27;s law. The gold-exchange standard gave governments more flexibility in inflating the money supply by weaning the public from its holding of actual gold in cash balances. Governments hoped that currency devaluation would achieve various objectives, such as reducing real wage rates, raising commodity prices, and encouraging exports, but these goals were often unsuccessful.

Mises discusses credit expansion, which can occur even on an unhampered market. Historically, banks maintained less than 100 percent reserves in the vault because most customers wouldn&#x27;t show up at the same time wishing to withdraw their funds. However, in modern times, governments have seized control of the monetary and banking system, and credit expansion is used for various ends, leading to the boom-bust cycle in modern economies. Socialists and interventionists blame recurring depressions on inherent failings of the market economy, but they don&#x27;t recognize the role played by government credit expansion during the boom. The government cannot alter the physical fact of the slump through borrowing money or creating additional quantities of paper money.

Foreign exchange control and bilateral exchange agreements are also discussed. A government may decree a maximum price for units of a foreign currency, which leads to a shortage of the foreign currency, blamed on speculators and an unfavorable trade balance. The government can resort to makeshifts to ease the problem, but it cannot help the trade balance in the long run. The government can enforce the official, overvalued exchange rate, while still permitting the return of the de facto market exchange rate, by subsidizing exporters and taxing importers, but this brings the economy closer to full-blown socialism. The government may resort to barter agreements with other nations to conceal the decline in the currency&#x27;s purchasing power against gold or other currencies. Nazi barter agreements with various foreign countries allowed governments to achieve their own political ends at the expense of members of their populations who were out of favor with the government.

Chapter 32, &quot;Confiscation and Redistribution&quot;, discusses the negative consequences of confiscatory taxation, land reform, and the philosophy of confiscation on economic growth and efficiency. Mises argues that production and distribution are integrated under capitalism, and confiscation can lead to capital consumption and discourage producers from investing. It also highlights how interference with market outcomes, such as breaking up larger farms or imposing progressive income taxation, can reduce efficiency, hamper growth, and benefit a few unproductive farmers or the rich. Finally, it argues against the claim that confiscatory taxation reduces entrepreneurs&#x27; appetite for risk-taking, arguing that the harm lies in reducing incentives for capital accumulation and consumption.

Chapter 33, &quot;Syndicalism and Corporativism&quot;, discusses syndicalism, guild socialism, and corporatism. Syndicalism can refer to revolutionary tactics to achieve socialism or a method of economic organization that aims to give workers ownership over their plants and equipment. However, the root of the syndicalist idea is the mistaken belief that entrepreneurs and capitalists are analogous to kings and aristocrats. Syndicalist policies grant privileges to a minority of workers that result in a lower standard of living for the immense majority. Guild socialism and corporatism aim to form monopolistic bodies where each branch of business has full autonomy to determine internal affairs. However, the essential flaw in this scheme is that entire branches of production cannot be &quot;autonomous&quot; under the division of labor. In practice, guild socialism will revert to outright socialism.

Chapter 34, &quot;The Economics of War&quot;, discusses the relationship between war and the market economy. Mises argues that the market economy relies on peaceful cooperation, while war involves total conflict. Before the French Revolution, wars in Europe were generally limited and waged by professional soldiers, but modern states engage in total war due to interventionism and central planning. Mises contends that only liberal policies, not treaties or international organizations, can ensure lasting peace. During wartime, the government must divert resources from consumer goods to military production, and entrepreneurs are best equipped to handle this switch if they are allowed to earn profits. However, the government&#x27;s attempt to maintain workers&#x27; real take-home pay during World War II led to market intervention, including rationing schemes and price controls. Mises argues that autarky (self-sufficiency) is not a viable solution to war since it produces inferior goods and higher production costs. Ultimately, Mises believes that interventionism generates economic nationalism and bellicosity, and only laissez-faire policies can lead to durable peace.

Chapter 35, &quot;The Welfare Principle Versus the Market Principle&quot;, provides a response to three criticisms against the market economy: poverty, inequality, and insecurity. Regarding poverty, Mises argues that capitalism and the rise of industry have allowed for more people to work and support themselves, while interventionism has hindered private charitable efforts. Inequality in incomes and wealth is an inherent feature of the market economy, and the only path to rising standards of living is through the continual increase in capital per capita. Finally, capitalism does give rise to income and wealth insecurity, but this is not the fault of capitalists but of consumers who each day seek the products and services that best satisfy their wants at the lowest prices. The modern welfare theorists are superior to older schools of reformers because they acknowledge that the only metric for a social system is their ability to allow men to achieve their ends.

Chapter 36, &quot;The Crisis of Interventionism&quot;, argues that interventionism has led to negative consequences such as world wars, depressions, famines, and civil wars, but these have been wrongly blamed on capitalism. Interventionism has now reached its end as it has exhausted its potentialities. The reserve fund, which is the wealth of the rich and the incomes of entrepreneurs, has been drained to pay for lavish benefits and spending on the working classes. The three reasons why interventionism must come to an end are that restrictive measures cannot constitute a system of production, intervention in the market fails to achieve its ends and aims at seizing the surplus from one group and giving it to another, and once the surplus is gone, interventionism must end. Even though most European countries have adopted socialism, they can still rely on the market prices generated in capitalist countries. People must choose between socialism and the market economy as there is no stable middle-of-the-road position, and if economic calculation becomes impossible due to the adoption of socialism, the result would be chaos and the disintegration of social cooperation.

=== Part Seven: The Place of Economics in Society ===
Chapter 37, &quot;The Nondescript Character of Economics&quot;, argues that economics is different from other branches of knowledge because its theories cannot be proven or falsified by experience. It is also noted that convincing the majority of the public is necessary for the insights of economic theorists to improve civilization. The chapter concludes by criticizing the old liberals for assuming that the majority would support capitalism based on its benefits and their ability to reason correctly, without anticipating the success of anticapitalist propaganda.

Chapter 38, &quot;The Place of Economics in Learning&quot;, explains, firstly, that the establishment of an institute for business-cycle research is not sufficient to find cures for business cycles. Clear thinking and sound economic theory are needed. Secondly, the rise of economics as a profession is due to interventionism, and many professional economists only advance the interests of a small group. Thirdly, economists can only predict the general timing of boom-bust cycles, and successful entrepreneurs need to have better forecasts than their rivals. Fourthly, although economics is a unified whole, university professors engage in compartmentalized analyses, and the fallacies of interventionism preached by professors may lead some students to support socialism. Fifthly, the conflict between different interpretations of history and economics exists in schools, but most students are too immature to choose among them, and teachers cannot present them neutrally. Lastly, modern governments suppress freedom of economic thought, but citizens have a duty to familiarize themselves with basic economic theory, as modern political controversies revolve around the conflict between socialism and the market economy.

Chapter 39, &quot;Economics and the Essential Problems of Human Existence&quot;, explores the relationship between science and life, economics and judgments of value, and economic cognition and human action. Critics argue that science is sterile because it is value-free, but Mises argues that science provides humans with the information they need to properly form their valuations and choose the proper means to achieve their desired ends. He also addresses criticisms that economics smuggles value judgments into its analyses, and that it assumes people are only concerned with material well-being, stating that economics deals with action as such and does not make assumptions about the objectives of action. Finally, Mises discusses the three restrictions on human freedom to act and choose, with the third restriction – the regularity of phenomena due to the connection between means and ends – being the subject of praxeology. If people ignore praxeology&#x27;s teachings, &quot;they will not annul economics&quot;, but &quot;they will stamp out society and the human race.&quot;

==Publishing history==
The German-language predecessor to &quot;Human Action&quot;, titled &quot;Nationalökonomie: Theorie des Handelns und Wirtschaftens&quot;, first appeared in 1940. &quot;Human Action&quot; was not a direct translation of the earlier work, but used its general framework and expanded on it.

Yale University Press published the first edition of &quot;Human Action&quot; in 1949. When production delays pushed back the planned released date of a revised and expanded second edition, Lyle Munson, publisher of Bookmailer, Inc., suggested that Mises could take the book to another publisher, and offered to publish it himself. Mises used this offer as leverage to get Yale University Press to accelerate its release. The resulting 1963 edition was full of typographical errors, and another one had to be printed quickly afterwards by another editor. Henry Regnery published the revised third edition in 1966.

A posthumous fourth edition was published in 1996, with revisions by Bettina B. Greaves. It is available in hardback single (Liberty Fund, ) and four-volume paperback editions (Liberty Fund, ), as well as single-volume paperback (Fox &amp; Wilkes, ). In 1998, the Ludwig von Mises Institute brought back the first edition as the &quot;Scholar&#x27;s Edition&quot; (). In 2010, the Institute reissued the first edition as a portable &quot;Pocket Edition&quot; ().

<doc id="236931" wikidata="Q2902225" url="?curid=236931" title="Big Flame (band)">
<text>Big Flame (often rendered bIG*fLAME) were a post-punk/indie rock three piece band, based in Manchester, England, and active from 1983 to 1986. The members were Alan Brown (bass, vocals), Greg Keeffe (guitar) and Dil Green (drums). After a debut EP (&quot;Sink&quot;) on their own Laughing Gun label, they joined the Ron Johnson roster for a series of mid-1980s singles as well as an appearance on the NME&#x27;s &quot;C86&quot; compilation.

On the reverse of the &quot;Two Kan Guru&quot; compilation, it was jokingly stated that Green and Brown played in the original line-up of Wham! with George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley.

In addition to releasing five singles and a compilation EP, Big Flame also recorded four sessions for the John Peel Show. Big Flame were a major influence on Manic Street Preachers. In a 1991 interview, Richey Edwards stated &quot;The 80s, for us, was the biggest non-event ever, like C86. All we had was Big Flame. Big Flame was the most perfect band. But we couldn&#x27;t play their records &#x27;cos they were too avant garde&quot;.

The group also operated beyond the confines of the band itself. Keeffe and Green hosted a night at Manchester&#x27;s Man Alive club which they christened &quot;The Wilde Club&quot; providing a useful venue for groups other than their own. This spirit was also reflected in Ugly Noise Undercurrents which was a band-swap concept conceived by Brown, to provide emerging groups with a facility for securing gigs in towns and cities beyond their home base. The Allez Ugly newsletter was the primary driver for this.

After the band split in 1986, Brown joined Ron Johnson labelmates A Witness on drums, touring the UK and Europe and appearing on several records (the 12-inch EP &#x27;One Foot in the Groove&#x27; and Strange Fruit Double Peel Sessions) and three sessions for BBC Radio One DJ John Peel. He left A Witness in 1988 to form solo project Great Leap Forward, while Keeffe joined Meatmouth (with Mark Whittam and Nicholas Blincoe) who released &quot;Meatmouth is Murder&quot; on Factory Records, FAC 196.

After a break from music, Alan Brown teamed up with Daren Garratt (of Pram) and Vince Hunt (of A Witness) in the band Marshall Smith, releasing an album &quot;Colours&quot; in 2006 on the Euphonium label.

In 2007, Alan Brown joined Sarandon as bass player, and performed with a reformed A Witness in 2014. Since 2008 he has revived The Great Leap Forward and continues to release albums on a sporadic basis.

Greg Keeffe was professor of sustainable architecture at Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds until May 2012, and is now Professor of Architecture at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

Dil Green is now an architect based in London.

<text>3DMark is a computer benchmarking tool created and developed by UL (formerly Futuremark), to determine the performance of a computer&#x27;s 3D graphic rendering and CPU workload processing capabilities. Running 3DMark produces a 3DMark score, with higher numbers indicating better performance. The 3DMark measurement unit is intended to give a normalized means for comparing different PC hardware configurations (mostly graphics processing units and central processing units), which proponents such as gamers and overclocking enthusiasts assert is indicative of end-user performance capabilities.

Many versions of 3DMark have been released since 1998. Scores cannot be compared across versions as each test is based on a specific version of the DirectX API. 3DMark 11 and earlier versions, being no longer suitable to test modern hardware, have been made available as freeware by providing keys to unlock the full version on the UL website.

<text>The rufous hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus) is a small hummingbird, about long with a long, straight and slender bill. These birds are known for their extraordinary flight skills, flying during their migratory transits. It is one of nine species in the genus &quot;Selasphorus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The rufous hummingbird was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other hummingbirds in the genus &quot;Trochilus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Trochilus rufus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the ruff-necked hummingbird described by John Latham in 1782 and the ruffed honeysucker described by Thomas Pennant in 1785. 

The type locality given by Gmelin was Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island in western Canada, although breeding was estimated to occur in northwestern North America and wintering in westcentral Mexico. The rufous hummingbird is now placed with eight other species in the genus &quot;Selasphorus&quot; that was introduced in 1832 by the English naturalist William Swainson. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;selas&quot; meaning &quot;light&quot; or &quot;flame&quot; with &quot;-phoros&quot; meaning &quot;-carrying&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;rufus&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;red&quot;. The species is considered as monotypic: no subspecies are recognized.

==Description==

The adult male has a white breast, rufous face, flanks and tail and an iridescent orange-red throat patch or gorget. Some males have some green on their back and/or crown. The female has green, white, and some iridescent orange feathers in the center of the throat, and a dark tail with white tips and rufous base.

The female is slightly larger than the male. Females and the rare green-backed males are extremely difficult to differentiate from Allen&#x27;s hummingbird. The typical &quot;notched&quot; shape of the second rectrix (R2) is considered an important field mark to distinguish the adult male rufous hummingbird from the adult male Allen&#x27;s hummingbird. This is a typical-sized hummingbird, being a very small bird. It weighs , measures long and spans across the wings.

==Distribution and habitat==

Western rufous hummingbirds migrate through the Rocky Mountains and nearby lowlands from May to September to take advantage of the wildflower season. They may stay in one local region for the entire summer, in which case the migrants (like breeding birds) often aggressively take-over and defend feeding locations. Most individuals winter in wooded areas in the Mexican state of Guerrero, traveling over by an overland route from their nearest summer home – a prodigious journey for a bird weighing only .

Adult male rufous hummingbirds tend to migrate slightly earlier than females or young. Since juveniles and females are essentially indistinguishable from Allen&#x27;s hummingbird, unless confirmed by close inspection, eastern rufous migrants may be classified as &quot;rufous/Allen&#x27;s hummingbirds&quot;.

==Behavior and ecology==

===Food and feeding===

They feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue or catch insects on the wing. These birds require frequent feeding while active during the day and become torpid at night to conserve energy. Because of their small size, they are vulnerable to insect-eating birds and animals.

===Hovering and sexual dimorphism===
A study that used digital imaging velocimetry to look at wing movements found that the rufous hummingbird supports its body weight during hovering primarily by wing downstrokes (75% of lift) rather than by upstrokes (25% of lift). When hovering during fasting, rufous hummingbirds oxidize fatty acids to support metabolism and food energy requirements, but can rapidly switch to carbohydrate metabolism (within 40 minutes) after feeding on flower nectar.
Both males and females are territorial; however, they defend different types of territories. The more aggressive males fight to defend areas with dense flowers, pushing females into areas with more sparsely populated flowers. Males generally have shorter wings than females, therefore their metabolic cost for hovering is higher. This allows males to beat their wings at high frequencies, giving them the ability to chase and attack other birds to defend their territory. The metabolic cost of short wings is compensated for by the fact that these males do not need to waste energy foraging for food, because their defended territory provides plenty of sustenance. Females on the other hand are not given access to the high concentration food sources, because the males fight them off. Therefore, females generally defend larger territories, where flowers are more sparsely populated, forcing them to fly farther between food sources. The metabolic cost of flying farther is compensated for with longer wings providing more efficient flight for females. The differences in wing length demonstrate a distinct sexual dimorphism, allowing each sex to best exploit resources in an area.

===Breeding===
Their primary breeding habitats are open areas, mountainsides and forest edges in western North America from southern Alaska through British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest to California, nesting further north (Alaska) than any other hummingbird. The female builds a nest in a protected location in a shrub or conifer. Males are promiscuous, mating with several females.

== Conservation status ==
In 2018, the rufous hummingbird was uplisted from least concern to near threatened on the IUCN Red List, on the basis that due to its reliance on insect prey during the wintering season, it will be heavily affected by the global decline in insect populations due to pesticides and intensified agriculture. Due to climate change, many flowers that the rufous hummingbird feeds on during the breeding season have started blooming two weeks prior to the birds&#x27; arrival to their breeding locations, which may lead to rufous hummingbirds arriving too late to feed on them.

<doc id="236940" wikidata="Q333811" url="?curid=236940" title="John Swinney">
<text>John Ramsay Swinney (born 13 April 1964) is a Scottish politician who has served as First Minister of Scotland since 2024. Swinney has served as Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) on two occasions, since 2024 and between 2000 and 2004. He has held various roles within the Scottish Cabinet from 2007 to 2023 under First Ministers Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. Swinney was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for North Tayside from 1999 to 2011 and, following boundary changes, has been MSP for Perthshire North since 2011. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Tayside North from 1997 to 2001.

Born in Edinburgh, Swinney graduated with a MA in politics at the University of Edinburgh. He joined the SNP at a young age, and quickly rose to prominence by serving as the National Secretary from 1986 to 1992 and as Deputy Leader from 1998 to 2000. He served in the House of Commons as MP for Tayside North from 1997 to 2001. He was elected to the inaugural Scottish Parliament at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. After Salmond resigned the party leadership in 2000, Swinney was elected at the 2000 leadership election. He became Leader of the Opposition in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP lost one MP at the 2001 general election and eight MSPs at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, despite the Officegate scandal unseating the previous Scottish Labour first minister, Henry McLeish. However, the only parties to gain seats in that election were the Scottish Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) which, like the SNP, support independence. After an unsuccessful challenge to his leadership in 2003, and the party&#x27;s unfavourable results at the 2004 European Parliament election, Swinney resigned. Salmond returned to the role at the subsequent 2004 leadership election.

From 2004 to 2007, Swinney was a backbencher. At the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won the highest number of seats, and Salmond was subsequently appointed first minister. Swinney served under Salmond as Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth from 2007 to 2014. After Sturgeon succeeded Salmond, she appointed Swinney as Deputy First Minister in 2014. He also served as Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Constitution and Economy, until that role was divided into two posts in the second Sturgeon government as a result of the expansion of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s financial powers; he was then appointed Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills in 2016, and then as Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery in 2021. On 25 May 2022, Swinney became the longest serving Deputy First Minister, surpassing the previous record which was held by Sturgeon. Swinney served as Acting Finance and Economy Secretary in addition to his position of Covid Recovery Secretary from July 2022 to March 2023. In March 2023, he announced his resignation from his senior positions in response to Sturgeon&#x27;s resignation as first minister.

Swinney spent the duration of Humza Yousaf&#x27;s premiership on the backbenches and served as a member of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Justice Committee. Following Yousaf&#x27;s announcement of his resignation in April 2024, Swinney ran to succeed him at the 2024 SNP leadership election and was elected unopposed. His early premiership was marked by the loss of 39 seats at the 2024 general election, reducing the SNP to the second-largest party in Scotland and the fourth-largest party in the Westminster Parliament.

== Early life ==

=== Family, education and early career ===
John Ramsay Swinney was born on 13 April 1964 in the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, the son of Kenneth Swinney, a garage manager, and Agnes Weir Swinney (&quot;née&quot; Hunter). His uncle Tom Hunter was awarded the Victoria Cross whilst serving with the Royal Marines during the Second World War. His maternal grandparents, Ramsey and Mary Hunter, were from England, having moved to Edinburgh in the 1920s.

Swinney was educated at Forrester High School, before attending the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with a Master of Arts Honours degree in politics in 1986. He was a research officer for the Scottish Coal Project from 1987 to 1988, a senior management consultant with Development Options from 1988 to 1992, and a strategic planning principal with Scottish Amicable Life Assurance from 1992 to 1997.

=== Early political involvement ===
Swinney joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1979 at the age of 15, citing his anger at the way in which Scotland had been portrayed by television commentators at the Commonwealth Games. He quickly became a prominent figure in the party&#x27;s youth wing, the &quot;Young Scottish Nationalist&quot;, now known as the &quot;Young Scots for Independence (YSI)&quot;. He served as the SNP&#x27;s Assistant National Secretary, before becoming the National Secretary in 1986, at the age of 22.

== Early political career ==

=== House of Commons ===

At the 1997 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Tayside North constituency, and in 1999 he was elected to represent the same area at the Scottish Parliament. He stood down as a Westminster MP at the 2001 general election in order to avoid splitting his time, in line with all of his colleagues who found themselves in a similar dual mandate position.

=== Election to Holyrood ===
In 1999 Swinney was elected to the 1st Scottish Parliament, representing the North Tayside constituency. In Salmond&#x27;s opposition cabinet, he served as the Spokesman on Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. He also served on the Parliament&#x27;s Finance Committee and was the Convener of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee.

== Leader of the SNP in opposition (2000–2004) ==

=== 2000 Leadership bid ===
In 2000 Alex Salmond resigned as leader of the SNP, which triggered a leadership contest. Swinney ran in the election against Alex Neil. The leadership contest was dominated by internal fights in the party between Gradualists, who advocated Scottish devolution as step towards independence, and Fundamentalists, who were suspicious of devolution and supported a more radical approach. Swinney represented the gradualist wing and Neil represented the fundamentalists wing. Whilst both candidates supported the position of the SNP on the centre-left, Neil was seen as the more left-wing of the two, and individuals associated with the Neil campaign argued that a Swinney leadership would drag the SNP to the right.

Swinney won an overwhelming majority of votes by party delegates, securing 67.1% of votes. He was appointed leader at the party&#x27;s conference on 16 September 2000. Roseanna Cunningham, who endorsed Swinney in the leadership race, was elected Depute Leader.

=== Tenure ===

==== Internal party divisions ====
Swinney&#x27;s leadership quickly came under challenge. His subdued style of debating technique was often contrasted with that of his more charismatic predecessor. In 2002 Dorothy-Grace Elder, the SNP MSP for the Glasgow region, resigned her party membership after coming dissatisfied with the leadership of the SNP. She sat as an independent MSP, but Swinney called for her resignation, describing her actions as a &quot;flout [of] the democratic will of the people of Glasgow&quot;. Margo MacDonald, a fundamentalist within the SNP, voiced her lack of confidence in Swinney&#x27;s leadership. MacDonald was placed fifth in the Lothians region for the 2003 Parliament election in the SNP&#x27;s candidate selection, effectively ending her chances of being re-elected as an SNP MSP. In protest, she ran instead as an independent candidate and was later expelled from the party.

In 2003 a former parliamentary candidate and a party activist in the Shetland Islands Brian Nugent announced that he was forming his own pro-independence party, the Scottish Party, which eventually relaunched itself as the Free Scotland Party, in response to what he perceived to be an overly pro-EU stance by the SNP.

==== 2001 UK and 2003 Scottish elections ====
Swinney led the SNP through a poor election result at the 2001 UK General election. The party failed to take any of their target seats and saw the loss of one of their MPs, reducing their representation at Westminster from six to five. In the Perth constituency, the Scottish Conservatives were 50 votes behind the SNP. Although the SNP&#x27;s vote share remained the second-largest party, behind Labour, their vote share fell by 2%. Swinney&#x27;s predecessor, Salmond, stated &quot;consolidating as the second party in Scotland is no mean achievement&quot; and highlighted it put the SNP in a good position for the upcoming Scottish Parliament election in 2003. Following the results of the election, Swinney admitted there were &quot;lessons to learn&quot; and ensured the SNP would be the &quot;principal opposition party in Scottish politics&quot;.

In the 2003 election, the SNP performed poorly in yet another election, with the party&#x27;s vote share dropping by 4.9%. They lost eight of their seats they had gained in the previous election under the leadership of Salmond. Despite a poor result, this was also mirrored by the Scottish Labour Party, who lost six MSPs and their vote share dropped by 4.2%. The SNP remained the second-largest party at Holyrood. The decline in support for the SNP was viewed by some as a rejection of the case for Scottish independence, however, the only parties which increased their representation in that election were the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and the Scottish Green Party, both of which also support independence.

==== 2003 leadership challenge ====
Following the results of the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, Bill Wilson, a party activist, became convinced that a change of direction was needed by the SNP leadership. After discussing this with various SNP members, he was persuaded to contest the leadership himself and launched a challenge against Swinney. Wilson ran a campaign attacking Swinney&#x27;s proposals for party reform, which he claimed would centralise power and impoverish local branches. Wilson also challenged Swinney to a series of debates, although Swinney refused to take part.

The election was yet another fight between the party&#x27;s fundamentalists and gradualists, with Wilson attacking Swinney&#x27;s proposal for a referendum on independence before pursuing negotiations with the British government. Wilson argued that as soon as the SNP can form a government it should pursue negotiations to end the union.

The election was held at the party&#x27;s 69th annual conference, and saw Swinney winning a massive victory over Wilson. Moves in support of Wilson&#x27;s proposition of pursuing independence negotiations without a referendum were thrown out at the party conference, and Swinney won significant policy battles over imposing a monthly levy on party MPs, MSPs, and MEPs. In a surprise result, the new central membership system was also approved. The membership changes had been a key issue of attack from Wilson. Soon afterwards, the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee decided to suspend and then expel Campbell Martin. He had backed Wilson&#x27;s leadership challenge and had continued to be overtly critical of Swinney&#x27;s leadership, resulting in disciplinary action. This was the last SNP election to use the delegate voting method. Future elections would be based on a one-person-one-vote postal vote system.

==== Scottish independence ====
In September 2003 he urged SNP activists to ask the public, &quot;Do you want independence, yes or no? And then tell the Brits to get off.&quot; A spokesman for Scottish Labour condemned the Swinney&#x27;s use of language and said, &quot;There is no place in Scotland for his brand of extreme nationalism.&quot;

==== 2004 European Parliament elections ====
Though retaining its two seats at the 2004 European elections, in a smaller field of 7 (Scotland up until then had 8 MEPs) the Scottish press and certain elements within the fundamentalist wing of the Party depicted the result as a disaster for the SNP putting further pressure on Swinney to resign.

=== Resignation ===
After the results of the 2004 European Parliament election, senior figures within the SNP began privately briefing against Swinney. Gil Paterson, a former MSP for Central Scotland, was the first to call for Swinney&#x27;s departure, with Michael Russell, a former potential campaign manager for Swinney calling for a change in approach from the SNP. Members of the SNP shadow cabinet began privately discussing removing Swinney from the leadership, and Alex Salmond advised Swinney to resign in exchange for senior party figures not calling openly for his resignation. On 22 June 2004, Swinney resigned as leader of the Scottish National Party, triggering a leadership contest. He was succeeded by Alex Salmond after winning more than 75% of votes against Roseanna Cunningham and Michael Russell on a joint leadership ticket with Nicola Sturgeon.

===Backbench MSP (2004–2007)===
From 2004 until the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Swinney sat on the SNP&#x27;s opposition backbenches. He served as a convener on the Parliament&#x27;s European and External Relations Committee from 2004 to 2005 and deputy convener on the Finance Committee from 2005 to 2007. Swinney was a substitute member of the Audit Committee from 2004 to 2007. In September 2005, Swinney was made Shadow Minister for Finance.

== Salmond administration (2007–2014) ==

=== Finance Secretary: 2007–2016 ===

In the 2007 election to the 3rd Scottish Parliament, the SNP emerged as the largest party, with one seat more than the governing Scottish Labour. Initially the SNP proposed coalition talks with the Scottish Liberal Democrats, however, they declined and instead Swinney led coalition talks with the Scottish Greens. After an agreement, Salmond was appointed first minister of Scotland and he appointed Swinney as the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth in his first minority government.

As response to Swinney not notifying the Scottish Parliament that he had let the Scottish Variable Rate lapse due to not funding this tax mechanism, the Scottish Parliament voted to censure him and called his actions &quot;an abuse of power&quot;. Subsequently, a freedom of information request showed that even if Swinney had funded the mechanism, problems and delays in the HM Revenue &amp; Customs computer system made any collection of the tax impossible. The Scottish Government added, &quot;The power has not lapsed, the HMRC simply does not have an IT system capable of delivering a ten-month state of readiness.&quot;

====2007–2008 financial crisis====

As Finance Secretary, Swinney was faced with the 2007–2008 financial crisis, which resulted in the Scottish economy entering recession. The Scottish economy began to gradually slow in 2007 as a result of stock market concerns regarding the U.S. housing market. Scottish economic output fell for four consecutive quarters before a slight recovery in Q3 in 2009, before falling again by the end of 2009. Swinney advocated that at the start of the 2008 financial crisis, the Scottish Government and Swinney as finance secretary &quot;acted swiftly to provide an immediate capital stimulus to Scotland&#x27;s economy at the start of the 2008 financial crisis. As a consequence, Scotland&#x27;s experience of recession has been shorter and shallower than the rest of the UK&quot;.

== Deputy First Minister of Scotland (2014–2023) ==

Following the defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign in the 2014 referendum, Salmond resigned as leader of the SNP and Swinney was seen as a likely candidate in the leadership race, however, he &quot;unreservedly&quot; ruled himself out for a second bid as leader and endorsed Nicola Sturgeon. Sturgeon was elected unopposed as leader and was subsequently appointed First Minister of Scotland. On 21 November 2014, Sturgeon appointed Swinney as Deputy First Minister. He remained as Finance Secretary in Sturgeon&#x27;s new cabinet.
=== Education Secretary: 2016–2021 ===
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP lost its overall majority, but remained the largest party with Sturgeon securing a second term as first minister. She reappointed Swinney as deputy first minister, and for the first time in nine years, he was reshuffled from his roles as Finance Secretary to Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills.

==== Educational performance ====
After the 2017 General Election saw the SNP lose 21 seats, pollster Professor John Curtice told the BBC that the party&#x27;s record on education had likely dented its popularity: &quot;The SNP may want to reflect that their domestic record, not least on schools, is beginning to undermine their support among those who on the constitutional question are still willing to support the Nationalist position.&quot;

In March 2020, after the results of Scottish students dropped in maths and science in the international PISA rankings for education, Swinney admitted, &quot;There is progress to be made in maths and science.&quot; Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: &quot;These two areas are so critical to the success of much of Scotland&#x27;s modern economy. We should be doing so much better.&quot;

==== 2020 SQA exam controversy ====
In August 2020, Swinney was subject to a vote of no confidence in Parliament, with the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all accusing Swinney of creating an exam results system which &quot;unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed so well&quot;. During the No Confidence debate, Nicola Sturgeon described him as &quot;one of the most decent and dedicated people in Scottish politics&quot;, while &quot;The Herald&quot; newspaper reported that: &quot;Mr Swinney endured a deeply uncomfortable hour in the Holyrood chamber, as opposition MSPs said he had been a serial failure at the education portfolio, and he knew it.&quot; The motion was defeated by 67 votes to 58 resulting in Swinney surviving the vote and remaining as Scottish Education Secretary.

==== Vote of no confidence ====
In March 2021 Swinney was the subject of a second motion of no confidence. As the minister in charge of liaising with the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints, Swinney twice refused to publish legal advice requested by the committee. After two votes in Parliament failed to persuade him to publish the advice, opposition parties announced a motion of no confidence in him. Swinney u-turned and published the advice; the Scottish Greens declared they would not support the motion of no confidence and it was defeated by 65 votes to 57.

==== Attainment gap ====
A report by Audit Scotland in March 2021 concluded that the results of Swinney&#x27;s efforts to reduce the poverty related attainment gap in Scottish education were &quot;limited and [fell] short of the Scottish Government’s aims. Improvement needs to happen more quickly and there needs to be greater consistency across the country.&quot; In 10 Scottish council areas the attainment gap between the richest and the poorest children increased.

=== Covid Recovery Secretary: 2021–2023 ===

Following the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Scottish Labour urged Sturgeon to replace Swinney as Cabinet Secretary for Education, citing what it called &quot;a litany of failures&quot;, in the &quot;hope a new minister can stop the rot.&quot; On 18 May, Sturgeon announced Swinney would continue as Deputy First Minister but would be reshuffled to the new cabinet role as Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery. Swinney also served as Acting Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy from July 2022, whilst Kate Forbes was on maternity leave.

Following Sturgeon&#x27;s resignation in February 2023, Swinney announced on 2 March 2023 that he was standing down from his position as Deputy First Minister. He stated that it had been an &quot;honour to serve Scotland&quot;. In March 2023, Swinney moved to the SNP&#x27;s backbenches and served as a member of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Justice Committee. He spent the duration of Humza Yousaf&#x27;s premiership on the backbenches.

== First Minister of Scotland (2024–present) ==

=== 2024 leadership bid ===
Following Yousaf&#x27;s resignation in April 2024 amid a government crisis, Swinney launched his leadership bid on 2 May, after Kate Forbes, who was a serious contender to become leader, dropped out and endorsed him.

Graeme McCormick announced he would challenge Swinney for the leadership, saying he had the 100 nominations on 5 May. Just hours later, he withdrew and endorsed Swinney, who became the presumptive nominee.

On 6 May, with no other candidates put forward, Swinney was elected as party leader unopposed. He said that he would work with Scottish unionists as leader.

=== Tenure ===

Swinney was officially sworn into office as first minister of Scotland on 8 May 2024 at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after receiving the Royal Warrant of Appointment by King Charles III.

Swinney&#x27;s early premiership was marked by the resolution of the Michael Matheson iPad scandal: the SNP MSP Michael Matheson had incurred a £11,000 bill after taking a Parliamentary iPad while on a family holiday, and had attempted to claim the bill back on expenses before admitting that the iPad had not been used for work purposes. Swinney refused to support the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&#x27;s proposed sanction on Matheson, describing Matheson as a &quot;friend and colleague&quot; who had &quot;made mistakes&quot;, and casting doubt on the integrity of the committee&#x27;s process: describing the process as &quot;prejudiced&quot;, Swinney claimed that Conservative MSP Annie Wells should have removed herself from the committee due to previous comments about Matheson&#x27;s conduct. Swinney&#x27;s support for Matheson was described as &quot;incredible and indefensible&quot; by the Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross, and &quot;unbelievable and embarrassing&quot; by the Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. Swinney directed the SNP to abstain on the parliamentary vote on the committee&#x27;s recommendations, after introducing an amendment re-iterating Swinney&#x27;s complaints about the investigation into Matheson. The Scottish Parliament subsequently voted in support of the committee&#x27;s proposed sanction, banning Matheson from the Scottish Parliament for 27 days and withholding his salary 54 days, the heaviest sanction ever awarded to an MSP.

==== Cabinet ====

The majority of Swinney&#x27;s cabinet were previously part of Yousaf&#x27;s previous governments. The only addition to the cabinet was Kate Forbes replacing Shona Robison as Deputy First Minister of Scotland, and taking part of Màiri McAllan&#x27;s responsibility for economy into her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic. Robison was, however, re-appointed by Swinney as Finance Secretary with additional responsibility for local government, with McAllan appointed as the reduced portfolio of Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Energy.

====Constitution====

Swinney claimed that he believed that Scottish independence could &quot;be achieved in the next five years&quot; as a result of Brexit consequences on Scotland and the Scottish economy, as well as the cost of living crisis. In an interview with Sky News, Swinney said &quot;if we look at two of the biggest issues we face as a country in Scotland; the effect of the cost of living and the implications of Brexit. Both of those are major strategic factors that are doing severe economic and social damage to Scotland because of bad decisions taken in Westminster. And independence is the answer to that&quot;.

====Gender Reform Bill====

Early into his premiership, Swinney faced questions from opposition parties regarding the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill which had been introduced by Shona Robison and was blocked by the UK Government using a Section 35 order under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998. Swinney claimed that &quot;the Supreme Court has said that we can&#x27;t legislate in that area and we can&#x27;t take forward that legislation&quot;.

====2024 UK election====
In July 2024, Swinney and his party contested all 57 Scottish seats for the 2024 United Kingdom general election. The SNP went into the election as the largest party at Westminster from Scotland, having won 48 out of 59 seats at the 2019 United Kingdom general election. Following the results of the 2024 United Kingdom general election in Scotland, the SNP became the second largest party in the UK Parliament representing Scottish seats, having won 9 seats, losing a total of 39 seats across Scotland. Across the United Kingdom, the results saw a Labour Party landslide victory, and similarly in Scotland, Scottish Labour became the largest party representing Scottish constituencies at Westminster.

Following the results, Swinney said that the outcome of the election in Scotland was &quot;very, very difficult and damaging&quot;. High profile SNP MPs lost their seats in the election, including Kirsten Oswald, Tommy Sheppard, Alison Thewliss and Joanna Cherry. On 7 July 2024, newly elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Keir Starmer travelled to Edinburgh on the first stop of his tour of the four countries of the United Kingdom and met with Swinney at the official residence of the First Minister, Bute House. During the meeting, both Swinney and Starmer agreed to &quot;work together&quot; and to &quot;reset the relationship between their two governments&quot;.

====Storm Éowyn====

In January 2025, the Met Office issued a rare Red alert warning for strong winds for much of Scotland. Ahead of the strong winds association with Storm Éowyn, Swinney urged the public &quot;not to travel&quot; and urged the public to take the alert seriously and follow all advice given by emergency services in preparation for the storm. On 23 January 2025, Swinney advised that local councils across Scotland would make decisions on areas such as schools closing during the storm, and advised that the Scottish Government Resilience Room had been activated to co-ordinate the government&#x27;s response and preparation for the storm. Storm Éowyn made impact in Scotland on 24 January 2025, leaving around 117,000 homes across the country without power and electricity supply, with wind speeds as high as 102mph recorded on the Tay Road Bridge. Swinney appealed to the public to have a &quot;high level of vigilance&quot;. 

Swinney issued a public statement on 25 January calling for &quot;patience&quot; as the cleanup operation began. Amber warnings for ice, snow and wind remained in place in most parts of Scotland over the weekend (24–26 January). Swinney stated that it was &quot;clear the severity of Storm Éowyn will continue into next week and this will have an impact on the speed at which utilities and local services can fully resume&quot;.

== Political positions ==
In September 2022, amid the death and state funeral of Elizabeth II, Swinney stated that the monarch should remain head of state of an independent Scotland. In May 2024, during an interview with Sky News, Swinney claimed that he believed that Scotland could become independent &quot;in the next five years&quot; as a consequence of Brexit and the cost of living crisis. In May 2024, Swinney described himself as following a &quot;moderate centre-left agenda&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Swinney was married to Lorna King from 1991 to 1998. They had two children: Judith and Stuart. The couple divorced in 1998 after the &quot;Daily Record&quot; revealed King had an affair with a married nursery teacher. The marriage was subsequently annulled by the Roman Rota in order that Swinney be allowed to marry in the Catholic Church, to which his second wife belongs.

In 2003, Swinney married Elizabeth Quigley, a BBC Scotland News reporter. Quigley was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2000. In 2010, she gave birth to Swinney&#x27;s third child, Matthew. They live near Blairgowrie in Perth and Kinross.

Swinney is a member of the Church of Scotland and has described himself as &quot;a man of deep Christian faith&quot;. However, he has clashed with his party colleague Kate Forbes due to her religious views (Forbes is a member of the Free Church of Scotland, a smaller and more conservative religious group).

Swinney was appointed to the Privy Council on 10 July 2024, entitling him to be styled &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

<doc id="236943" wikidata="Q2478325" url="?curid=236943" title="Environmental noise">
<text>Environmental noise is an accumulation of noise pollution that occurs outside. This noise can be caused by transport, industrial, and recreational activities.

Noise is frequently described as &#x27;unwanted sound&#x27;. Within this context, environmental noise is generally present in some form in all areas of human, animal, or environmental activity. The effects in humans of exposure to environmental noise may vary from emotional to physiological and psychological. Noise at low levels is not necessarily harmful. Environmental noise can also convey a sense of liveliness in an area, which can be desirable. The adverse effects of noise exposure (i.e. noise pollution) could include: interference with speech or other &#x27;desired&#x27; sounds, annoyance, sleep disturbance, anxiety, hearing damage and stress-related cardiovascular health problems.

As a result, environmental noise is studied, regulated, and monitored by many governments and institutions around the world. This creates a number of different occupations. The basis of all decisions is supported by the objective and accurate measurement of noise. Noise is measured in decibels (dB) using a pattern-approved sound level meter. The measurements are typically taken over a period of weeks, in all weather conditions.

== Emission ==

Noise from transportation is typically emitted by machinery (e.g. the engine or exhaust) and aerodynamic noise (see aerodynamics and aircraft noise) caused by the compression and friction in the air around the vessel during motion. Environmental noise from the railway specifically is variable depending on the speed and quality of the tracks used for transportation.

Industrial and recreational noise could be generated by a multitude of different sources and processes. Industrial noise can be generated by factories and plants (i.e., product fabrication or assembly), power generation (hydroelectricity or wind turbines), construction activities, or agricultural and meat processing facilities. Sources of recreational noise vary widely but they can include music festivals, shooting ranges, sporting events, car racing, woodworking, pubs, people&#x27;s activities on the street, etc.

Sound propagation outdoors is subject to meteorological effects (e.g. wind, temperature) that affect the distance, speed, and direction with which environmental noise travels from a source to a listener.

== Children ==
Children and adolescents are just as susceptible to environmental noise exposure as adults. Similar to adults, with the exposure to noise there can be damaging outcomes on mental health. The environmental noises that children can be exposed to are traffic noise, aircraft, trains, and more. There are some pieces of evidence that show a small correlation between environmental noise and reading and oral comprehension.

Environmental noise in children is most commonly by people around them whether that be siblings crying or friends screaming. Then children are mostly exposed to animal noises and traffic noise. When researchers asked children how they felt when it came to environmental noises around them, more felt negative emotions as compared to positive emotions. The negative emotions were tied to environmental sound, for example, traffic noise, industrial noises, sirens, and alarms. The positive emotions were tied to winds, fans, and everyday household noises. 

== Health effects ==

Noise and quality of life are correlated. The increase of environmental noise, especially for those living near railways and airports, has created conflict. Getting adequate and quality sleep is difficult for those who live in areas of high noise exposure. When the body is at rest, noise stimuli is continually being presented in the environment. The body responds to these sounds which can negatively affect sleep.

High exposure to environmental noise can play a role in cardiovascular disease. Noise can raise blood pressure, change heart rate, and release stress hormones. Consistent changes in these health statistics can lead to risks for hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and even more serious events such as a stroke or myocardial infarction.

Sleep deprivation is another aspect of health that is affected by environmental noise. In order for our bodies to function properly, we need sleep and for some people having excessive environmental noise around them can cause difficulties sleeping. For many, even ambient noise can affect their sleep state which can then affect their quality of life and outlook.

Those with misophonia may be particularly affected by environmental noise, especially when the sounds produced are repetitive or continuous over a long period of time.

== Policy and regulation ==

=== United States ===
The Noise Control Act of 1972 established a U.S. national policy to promote an environment for all Americans to be free from noise that jeopardizes their health and welfare. In the past, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) coordinated all federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The EPA phased out the office&#x27;s funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to state and local governments. The Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in effect today, although essentially unfunded.

Today, in the absence of a national guidance and enforcement by the EPA, states, cities, and municipalities have had little or no guidance on writing competent and effective noise regulations. Since the EPA last published its Model Community Noise Ordinance in 1974, communities have struggled to develop their ordinances, often relying on copying guidance from other communities, and sometimes copying their mistakes. Noise laws and ordinances vary widely among municipalities though most specify some general prohibition against making noise that is a nuisance and the allowable sound levels that can cross a property line. Some ordinances set out specific guidelines for the level of noise allowable at certain times of the day and for certain activities.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates aircraft noise by specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by &quot;stage&quot; designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 – Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36). The FAA also pursues a program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community. The FAA has set up a process to report aviation-related noise complaints for anyone who may be impacted by Aircraft noise.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed noise regulations to control highway noise as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise.

The U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Bureau of Transportation Statistics has created a National Transportation Noise Map to provide access to comprehensive aircraft and road noise data on national and county-level. The map aims to assist city planners, elected officials, scholars, and residents to gain access to up-to-date aviation and Interstate highway noise information.

=== European Union ===

The European Union has a special definition based on the European directive 2002/49/EC article 10.1. This directive gives a definition for environmental noise. The main goal is to create an integrated noise management system. The Environmental Noise Directive (END) was created in the European Union to provide guidelines, laws, and standards in the management of environmental noise. The END has created noise mapping, noise action plans, and quiet areas to control environmental noise and the negative effects it can have on individuals.

The implementation is divided into phases: In the first phase, the member states shall inform about major roads with more than six million vehicles a year, major railways with more than 60,000 trains per year, major airports with more than 50,000 movements per year and metropolitan areas with more than 250,000 inhabitants. In the second phase, these numbers are halved; only the criteria for airports remains unchanged. In the third and the following phases, the methods for calculation of the noise levels will change while the criteria remains unchanged. Each phase consists of three steps: the collection of the data from the main sources of noise, strategic noise maps and action plans. The countries listed below follow the guidelines of the European Union.

There are many groups of people affected by environmental noise within the European Union. Shift workers, older adults, and those without proper insulation in their homes are just some of those affected.  Within the European Union 40% of people are exposed to environmental noise in their daily commutes on the road which exceeds 55 dB(A). During the daytime, approximately 20% of people are exposed to environmental noise levels above 65 dB(A) and during the nighttime, 30% of people are exposed to environmental noise above 55 dB(A).

==== Austria ====

In Austria the institution which is responsible for the noise sources is also responsible for the noise maps concerning these sources. This means that the Federation is responsible for the federal roads and each state is responsible for the country&#x27;s roads.

==== France ====

France reported 24 metropolitan areas. Paris was the biggest with 9.6 million inhabitants and 272 square kilometres.

Many of France&#x27;s residents are exposed to high levels of noise. Previously it was estimated that 10% of the population, approximately 2 million people, were exposed to above 70 dB Leq. That number is estimated higher today.

Aircraft plays a major role in environmental noise. A study conducted in 2018 found that while aircraft noise in decibel level cannot cause any psychological-illness, there is a link to how aircraft noise causes an annoyance to residents which then leads to psychological illness. The sensitivity of noise among people has an association with environmental noise and those affects.

==== Germany ====

Germany implemented national regulations in 2005 and 2006 and reported 27 metropolitan areas in the first phase. Berlin was the most populated with 3.39 million inhabitants and 889 square kilometres, Hamburg was considered the largest with 1,045 square kilometres and 2 million inhabitants. The smallest was Gelsenkirchen with 270,000 inhabitants and 105 square kilometres. In the national legislation, noise resulting from recreational activities like sports and leisure is not considered as environmental noise.

=== United Kingdom ===

The United Kingdom has 28 metropolitan areas, and London is the largest with 8.3 million inhabitants. Most are in England. Three are in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Within the United Kingdom, researchers revealed that approximately 55% of the population lived where the sound level exceeded the recommended level of 55 dB Leq in the daytime and 67% lived where the sound level exceeded the recommended level of 45 dB Leq at night. About 20% of London residents were exposed to environmental noise near their home that was above 60 dBA Leq. All of these environmental noise exposures have led to higher increases in blood pressure within the UK population.

<text>In Irish mythology, Naisi, Noíse or Noisiu (modern spelling: Naoise ) was the nephew of King Conchobar mac Nessa of Ulster, and a son of Uisneach (or Uisliu). He is mentioned in the tale known as the &quot;Tragic Tale of the Sons of Uisnech&quot;, or &quot;Exiles of the Sons of Uisnech&quot;, usually found within the set of stories in the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;, part of the Ulster Cycle.

In the tale he becomes the lover of Deirdre, a woman of great beauty, who is also desired by the king of Ulster Conchobar mac Nessa, and so the lovers go with Naoise&#x27;s two brothers into exile in Scotland (Alba). Eventually, Conchobar seeks to get them to return, but a series of unfortunate events (including a &quot;geas&quot; placed on Fergus mac Róich their protector and escort, as well as Naoise and his brothers&#x27; repeated disregard for Deirdre&#x27;s prophetic warnings) and the treachery of Conchobar brought on by his desire for Deirdre, leads to tragedy.

The tale climaxes with battle at the Red Branch house at Emain Macha, with many dead including Naoise, his brothers Ainle and Ardan, and Conchobar&#x27;s son Fiacha. Ultimately the sons of Uisnech are killed in one blow delivered by Maine Red Hand son of the King of Norway (or by Éogan mac Durthacht depending on source). The whole event leads to considerable strife between Ulster and Connacht, the disinheritance of Conchobar and his descendants to the title King of Ulster, and the destruction of Emain Macha.

==Mythic biography==
:Naoise&#x27;s and Deirdre&#x27;s story appears in the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (Cattle raid of Cooley), in the story part sometimes entitled &quot;The Tragical Death of the Sons of Usnach&quot;. The following summary is based on the translations of Whitley Stokes and O&#x27;Flanagan edited in , Naoise here rendered as Naisi in the text :

When Deirdre was born, Cathbad the druid named her, and prophesied that she would cause much trouble and strife - on hearing this the assembled lords would have had her killed then, but king Conchobar prevented it and decided to have her brought up in seclusion, and that when she was old enough, he would marry her. She grew up to outshine other women of the time in beauty.

One snowy day when she saw her foster father kill a calf, on which a raven fell to drink the animals blood - she said she wanted a husband who had in him the three colors she saw - hair the color of the raven, cheeks red like the calf&#x27;s blood, and skin the color of snow. She was told that such a man existed in the house of Conchobar - named Naisi (Naoise), son of Usnach, son of Conall Flatnailed, son of Rury the Great. She asked that she might speak with him, in secret. Naisi met with her, and she declared her love for him, and asked to elope, which he agreed to, though he was tardy to carry out, for fear of Conchobar.

Thus Naisi and his two brothers, Ainle and Ardan, together with one hundred and fifty warriors, went to Scotland and entered the paid service of the King of Scotland. The Scottish King heard of Deirdre&#x27;s great beauty and too tried to get her for himself, on which Naisi and his brothers left for an island in the sea, after many battles with the king&#x27;s men.

Conchobar was at another feast with his people, and asked them if they wanted for anything. They replied they had no want, except the loss of their kinsmen Naisi, Ainle, and Ardan - because of the woman Deirdre. Having heard this Conchobar decided to send an envoy. However Naisi was prohibited from returning to Ireland except with either Cúchulainn, Conall Cernach, or Fergus mac Ross. Conchobar chose Fergus to go fetch for them.

Fergus journeyed to Loch Etive in Alba (Scotland), and found the hunting lodges of the Naisi and his two brothers, but there was no recent sign of them. Fergus then went to the harbor and made a loud call for them, which was heard by Naisi and Deirdre. Naisi said he had heard an Irish voice, and so had Deirdre, but she lied and said she thought it was a Scottish voice. Fergus called again, and the same happened; and then a third time, and Naisi became sure it was Fergus&#x27; voice and asked Ardan to go and meet him.

Deirdre confessed that she had recognized the voice, but concealed the truth as she had a vision the previous night, of three birds from Emain Macha bringing honey in their beaks but returning with blood in their beaks - she interpreted this as meaning that the messenger came with a false promise of peace. Nevertheless, they greeted Fergus warmly, and he then told him of his task as envoy, to make them return to Ulster. The exiles spoke of their missing Ireland, but Deirdre still did not wish to go out of worry - Fergus promised he would give them his protection against any in Ireland, and so Naisi agreed to return.

On the way they came to the fort of Borrach (son of Annte). Borrach welcomed them, and offered a feast (as Conchobar had instructed him to do), but placed Fergus under a &quot;geasa&quot; not to leave the feast until it was finished. Fergus became flustered, telling Borrach that he had promised to bring the three back to Emain Macha on the same day that they returned to Ireland. Fergus decided to stay at the feast and send his own two sons with the returning exiles back to Emain Macha.

The exiles left Borrach&#x27;s place. Deirdre counseled Naisi to stay at the island of Cuilenn, but Fergus&#x27;s sons (Illann the Fair, and Buinne the Ruthless Red) spoke against it. Then they went to the White Cairn of Watching on Slaib Fuad, but Deirdre fell behind, and fell asleep. Naisi turned back and found her as she awoke from a dream. She told Naisi of her dream - in it she sees Naisi and Illann headless, but Buinne not with them. Next the party went to Ard na Sailech. Again Deirdre had premonitions, envisioning a &#x27;cloud of blood&#x27; over Naisi, Ainle, and Ardan&#x27;s head. She counselled that they should go to Dún Delgan (Dundalk) and stay until Fergus could join them, or seek Cúchulainn as escort, but the brothers were not worried, and did not follow her advice.

They then went straight to Emain Macha. On reaching it Deirdre foretold a way they could tell whether or not Concobar would do them ill - if they were invited into Cochobar&#x27;s house they were safe, but if they were invited into the house of the Red Branch without Concobar then evil was intended for them.

At Emain Macha they knocked, and on telling the doorman who it was Concobar said to send them to the Red Branch house. Deirdre suggested they leave, but the men would not, lest they be called timid. They entered the house of the Red Branch, and were served with great food and drink - all the servants drank and ate and became merry, but the exiles would not eat or drink. Naisi then called for Concobar&#x27;s chessboard (the &quot;Cennchaem&quot;) to be brought so they could play - at the same time Conchobar inquired of Deirdre, asking if she was still so beautiful. Concobar&#x27;s envoy (Levarcham) returned and told him who was there, and that Deirdre was changed from when she left.

Conchobar sent messengers to tell him of Deirdre&#x27;s appearance twice more. Then he spoke to Tréndorn saying &quot;do you know who killed my father (and three brothers)?&quot; - Tréndhorn replied it was Naisi - then Conchobar sent him report on Deirdre&#x27;s appearance. As he spied through a window he was spotted, and Naisi threw a chess piece at him so well he lost an eye - he returned to Conchobar and told him &quot;The woman whose form and feature are loveliest in the world is there, and Naisi would be king of the world if she were left to him.&quot; Conchobar became enraged and ordered an assault on the Red Branch house.

A the house Conchobar and his men, and the Naisi and his exchanged words, then fighting began. Buinne slew many of Conchobar&#x27;s men, but Conchobar asked his price, and bribed him with land, and he deserted his companions. The Illann came forth and killed many of Conchobar&#x27;s men, and would not take a bribe like his brother. Conchobar asked for his own son Fiacha, born on the same night as Illann. He gave Fiacha his arms, but after a hard fight, Illann won. Conchobar&#x27;s shield made a great sound when its wielder was in distress, and Conall son of Amargin heard it, thinking Conchobar was in need, and came - seeing the scene of the battle he took his spear (&quot;Culghlas&quot;) and killed Illann. Wounded, Illann asked who had done it, and told them he was there to guard Naisi and his brothers - on hearing this Conall was sorry, and killed Fiacha in revenge. Illann called Naisi to the fight, then died.

Ardan defended the Red Branch house on the first night, slaying many; the next night Ainle defended; on the third night Naisi defended, also killing many attackers. The three then formed a shield around Deirdre, and leapt outside the walls of Emain. Concobar told his druid Cathbad to put an enchantment on the escapees, stating that if he did so he would not harm them. Cathad conjured water to prevent them. Concobar then called for someone to kill Naisi but none from Ulster would. However one Maine Red-hand from Norway, whose father and brothers had been killed by Naisi, was willing to do the beheading.

Ardan said he should die first, as the youngest, but Ainle offered himself; Naisi gave his exceptional sword, which was from Manannán mac Lir himself, to Maine, and Maine killed all three with it, in one blow. Deirdre kissed her dead husband and drank his blood, and sang a long lament. She then flung herself into Naisi&#x27;s grave and died.

Cathbad cursed Emain Macha because of the evil of that day, and said that neither Conchobar nor his descendants would ever possess it again. Fergus came the next day, and saw the disaster, and (together with Cormac &quot;conloinggeas&quot; and Dubhtach &quot;daelultach&quot;) gave battle to Conchobar, brought the destruction of Emain Macha, together with Conchobar&#x27;s women. Fergus then sought aid from Ailill King of Connacht, and Maeve the queen. Much of Ulster was raided or destroyed, with hostilities continuing for several years.

<doc id="236947" wikidata="Q513753" url="?curid=236947" title="Road map for peace">
<text>The roadmap for peace or road map for peace ( &quot;Mapa had&#x27;rakhim&quot;, &quot;Khāriṭa ṭarīq as-salāmu&quot;) was a plan to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict proposed by the Quartet on the Middle East: the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations. The principles of the plan, originally drafted by U.S. Foreign Service Officer Donald Blome, were first outlined by U.S. President George W. Bush in a speech on 24 June 2002, in which he called for an independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in peace. A draft version from the Bush administration was published as early as 14 November 2002. The final text was released on 30 April 2003. The process reached a deadlock early in phase I and the plan was never implemented.

==Background==
The Second Intifada, which started in September 2000, was an escalation of mutual violence. In March 2002, in response to a wave of Palestinian suicide attacks, culminating in the &quot;Passover massacre&quot;, Israel launched a major military operation in the West Bank, dubbed Operation Defensive Shield. Virtually the entire Palestinian public administration was destroyed by the Israeli army. Israel re-established its full exclusive military control over the West Bank, including Areas A and B, which were intended to be handed over to the Palestinian Authority within the framework of the Oslo II Accord. The army largely destroyed Arafat&#x27;s Compound in Ramallah, containing the main offices of the PA, and placed President Yasser Arafat under siege.

The US, EU, UN and Russia, who became the Quartet on the Middle East, tried to save the &quot;peace process&quot; with a new plan. This happened against the background of George W. Bush&#x27;s &quot;war on terror&quot;, which started after the 11 September 2001 attacks and dominated international politics.

==Development of the plan==

The Roadmap is based on a speech of U.S. President George W. Bush on 24 June 2002. A first EU-draft, proposed in September 2002, was put aside in favour of a U.S.-draft. The draft version from the Bush administration was published as early as 14 November 2002. The EU pushed the Quartet to present the final text on 20 December 2002, but failed, due to Israeli opposition. Sharon pledged support for the Roadmap, provided the Palestinian state was restricted to 42% of the West Bank and 70% of the Gaza strip; and under full Israeli control. Israel ruled out the division of Jerusalem and the Palestinian right of return and requested more than 100 changes to the Roadmap. Only after Sharon&#x27;s re-election, the nomination of Mahmoud Abbas as Palestinian prime minister and the installation of a new Palestinian government the plan was finally published on 30 April 2003, the day the invasion phase of the Iraq War ended. In a statement, Bush made clear that the plan was developed by the United States, not by the Quartet.

==The plan==
Described as a &quot;performance-based and goal-driven roadmap&quot;, the Roadmap was built on goals without going into details. It may be summarized as:

* End the violence; 
* Halt settlement activity; 
* Reform Palestinian institutions; 
* Accept Israel&#x27;s right to exist; 
* Establish a viable, sovereign Palestinian state; 
* and reach a final settlement on all issues by 2005.

However, as a performance-based plan, progress would require and depend upon the good faith efforts of the parties, and their compliance with each of the obligations the Quartet put into the plan. This made the Roadmap different from former peace plans; there was no (unrealistic) time-scheme to reach the goal, a Palestinian state.

The Roadmap was composed of three phases: I. Satisfying the preconditions for a Palestinian state;

II. Creating an independent Palestinian state with &quot;provisional&quot; borders;

III. Negotiations on a permanent status agreement, recognition of a Palestinian state with &quot;permanent&quot; borders and end of conflict.
* Phase I (finished as early as May 2003): Mutual recognition; an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to end armed activity and all acts of violence against Israelis anywhere; Palestinian political-institutional reform; Palestinian elections; Israeli withdrawal to the positions of 28 September 2000 (the start date of the Second Intifada; the plan does not speak of any further withdrawal). Israel refrains from deportations, attacks on civilians, demolitions and destructions, and other measures; reopens Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem; improves the humanitarian situation, fully implements the Bertini report, eases movement; freezes settlement expansion and dismantles settlement outposts built since 2001.
* Phase II (June–December 2003): An international summit to support Palestinian economic recovery and launch a process leading to establishment of an independent Palestinian state with provisional borders; revival of multilateral engagement on issues including regional water resources, environment, economic development, refugees, and arms control issues; Arab states restore pre-intifada links to Israel (including trade offices, etc.).
* Phase III (2004–2005): A second international conference; permanent status agreement and end of conflict; agreement on final borders, clarification of the highly controversial question of the fate of Jerusalem, refugees and settlements; Arab states to agree to peace deals with Israel.
Note: A provisional state in Phase II would thus include all existing settlements and exclude East Jerusalem. Although the plan was presented with considerable delay, the original timetable was not adapted.

==Sharon&#x27;s rejection of a settlement freeze==
On 12 May 2003, it was reported that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had stated that a settlement freeze, a main Road Map commitment, would be &quot;impossible&quot; due to the need to build new houses for settlers who start families. Ariel Sharon asked, then US Secretary of State, Colin Powell &quot;What do you want, for a pregnant woman to have an abortion just because she is a settler?&quot;.

==Israel&#x27;s conditions==
While the Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas accepted the Roadmap, right-wing ministers in the Israeli government opposed it. Sharon could only accept the plan with &quot;some artful language&quot;, thus the Government accepted &quot;the steps set out in the Roadmap&quot;, rather than the Roadmap itself.

On 25 May 2003, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Cabinet approved the Roadmap with 14 reservations.
 These included:
#* The Palestinians will dismantle the (PA&#x27;s) security organizations and reform their structures;
#* The Palestinians must cease violence and incitement and educate for peace;
#* The Palestinians must complete the dismantling of Hamas and other militant groups and their infrastructure, and collect and destroy all illegal weapons;
#* No progress to Phase II before all above-mentioned conditions are fulfilled;
#* (Unlike the Palestinians) Israel is not obliged to cease violence and incitement against the other party, pursuant to the Roadmap.
# No progress to the next phase before complete cessation of terror, violence and incitement. No timelines for carrying out the Roadmap.
# Replacement and reform of the current leadership in the Palestinian Authority (including Yasser Arafat). Otherwise no progress to Phase II.
# The process will be monitored by the United States (not the Quartet).
# The character of the provisional Palestinian state will be determined through negotiations. The provisional state will be demilitarized, with provisional borders and &quot;certain aspects of sovereignty&quot;, and subjected to Israeli control of the entry and exit of all persons and cargo, plus its airspace and electromagnetic spectrum (radio, television, internet, radar, etc.).
# Declaration of Israel&#x27;s right to exist as a Jewish state, as well as the waiver of any right of return of Palestinian refugees to Israel.
# Prior to the final settlement talks in Phase III, no discussions about settlements, Jerusalem and borders would be allowed. Topics would be limited to a settlement freeze and illegal outposts.
# No references other than the key provisions of United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338. No reference to other peace initiatives (it is unclear if the Oslo Accords are included).
# Withdrawal to the September 2000 lines will be conditional.
# Israel is not bound to the Bertini Report with respect to improving Palestinian humanitarian issues.

===Validity of the reservations===
The Roadmap was offered for acceptance &quot;as it is&quot;, without room for adaptations. The Government statement of 25 May 2003, however, made clear that Israel regarded its reservations part of the Roadmap:
The Government of Israel affirms the Prime Minister&#x27;s announcement, and resolves that all of Israel&#x27;s comments, as addressed in the Administration&#x27;s statement, will be implemented in full during the implementation phase of the Roadmap.
Furthermore, the Government definitively ruled out the &quot;right of return&quot;:
The Government of Israel further clarifies that, both during and subsequent to the political process, the resolution of the issue of the refugees will not include their entry into or settlement within the State of Israel.

A U.S. official, however, said that U.S. commitment did not mean that all of Israel&#x27;s demands would be met. Abbas called the Israeli reservations to the map &quot;not part of the map and ... not relevant to its implementation, and ... not acceptable to the Palestinians.&quot;

==Start and deadlock==

===Restructuring the Palestinian government===
The first step on the Roadmap was the appointment of the first-ever Palestinian prime minister Mahmoud Abbas (also known as ), by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The United States and Israel demanded that Arafat be neutralized or sidelined in the Roadmap process, claiming that he had not done enough to stop Palestinian attacks against Israelis while in charge. The United States refused to release the Roadmap until a Palestinian prime minister was in place. Abbas was appointed on 19 March 2003, clearing the way for the release of the Roadmap&#x27;s details on 30 April 2003.

===Hostilities after publication===
The publication of the Roadmap could not stop the violence of the &quot;Second Intifada&quot;. Hamas rejected it, saying that &quot;Abu Mazen is betraying the Palestinian people&#x27;s struggle and jihad in order to appease the USA and to avoid angering Israel&quot;. From 1 to 17 May 2003, 43 Palestinian civilians were killed; from 5 to 17 May, 4 Israeli civilians. After a suicide attack on 18 May, which killed 6 Israelis, the army carried out 35 punitive demolitions of Palestinian homes.

On 27 May 2003, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stated that the &quot;occupation&quot; of Palestinian territories was &quot;a terrible thing for Israel and for the Palestinians&quot; and &quot;can&#x27;t continue endlessly.&quot; Sharon&#x27;s phraseology prompted shock from many in Israel, leading to a clarification that by &quot;occupation,&quot; Sharon meant control of millions of Palestinian lives rather than actual physical occupation of land.

The Route 60 ambush took place on 20 June, as Secretary of State Colin Powell was in Jerusalem engaging in peace negotiations.

===Summits===
President Bush visited the Middle East from 2 to 4 June 2003 for two summits as part of a seven-day overseas trip through Europe and Russia in an attempt to push the Roadmap. On 2 June, Israel freed about 100 Palestinian prisoners before the first summit in Egypt as a sign of goodwill. The list consisted largely of administrative detainees who were due to be released. Subsequent prisoner releases involved members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, but the government insisted that those slated for release did not have Israeli &quot;blood on their hands.&quot; In Egypt on 3 June, President Bush met with the leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Bahrain, and with Prime Minister Abbas. The Arab leaders announced their support for the Roadmap and promised to work on cutting off funding to terrorist groups. On 4 June, Bush headed to Jordan to meet directly with Ariel Sharon and Mahmoud Abbas.

After Bush left the region violence resumed, threatening to derail the Roadmap plan.

===Hudna===
On 29 June 2003, a tentative unilateral cease-fire (&quot;hudna&quot; in Arabic) was declared by the Palestinian Authority and four major Palestinian groups. Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas announced a joint three-month cease-fire, while Yasser Arafat&#x27;s Fatah faction declared a six-month truce. The cease-fire was later joined by the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. One condition of maintaining the truce was a demand for the release of prisoners from Israeli jails, which was not part of the Roadmap process. This coincided with a visit to the region by United States National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.

On 1 July 2003, in Jerusalem, Sharon and Abbas held a first-ever ceremonial opening to peace talks, televised live in both Arabic and Hebrew. Both leaders said the violence had gone on too long and that they were committed to the Roadmap for peace. On 2 July, Israeli troops pulled out of Bethlehem and transferred control to Palestinian security forces. The plan required that Palestinian police take over from withdrawing Israeli forces and stop any anti-Israeli militant attacks. At the same time, the U.S. announced a $30 million aid package to the Palestinian Authority to help rebuild infrastructure destroyed by Israeli incursions.

The &quot;hudna&quot; quickly collapsed. On 3 July, the IDF killed 2 civilians. In an IDF operation to arrest Hamas members, gunfight broke out in which an Israeli soldier and two alleged Hamas militants were killed. A new cycle of violence happened. Hamas responded with a suicide bombing on 12 August, killing one Israeli civilian. Fatah claimed responsibility for a second suicide bombing on 12 August, killing another Israeli citizen. Despite this &quot;de facto&quot; violation of the &quot;hudna&quot;, Hamas stated that the cease-fire would continue.

Hostilities then escalated. The Israeli army killed Islamic Jihad&#x27;s Muhammad Seeder on 14 August 2003; the Jerusalem bus 2 massacre by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on 19 August, killed 23 and wounded 136 people. Israel reacted causing large-scale destruction to Palestinian population centres. On 21 August, Israel assassinated Hamas&#x27; political leader Ismail Abu Shanab. Shanab, who supported a two-state solution, strongly opposed suicide bombings and tried to uphold the ceasefire, was regarded as one of Hamas&#x27;s more moderate and pragmatic leaders. Along with Shanab, three other civilians (his two bodyguards and a 74-year-old man) were killed. The following days it continued with a range of further Israeli killing-attacks. The assassinations of Seeder and Shanab resulted in Hamas calling off the ceasefire with Israel. International criticism of Israel increased because Israel was widely believed to be unwilling to respect the truce.

===Deadlock===
In November 2003, the United Nations Security Council endorsed the Roadmap in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1515 which called for an end to all violence including &quot;terrorism, provocation, incitement and destruction&quot;. By the end of 2003, the Palestinian Authority had not prevented Palestinian terrorism, and Israel had neither withdrawn from Palestinian areas occupied since 28 September 2000, nor frozen settlement expansion. Thus the requirements of Phase I of the Roadmap were not fulfilled, and the Roadmap has not continued further. It eventually reached deadlock.

==Developments in 2004==
In 2004, the peace process was still overshadowed by the Second Intifada, characterized by mutual Palestinian and Israeli violence. Reportedly, some 110 Israelis and 820 Palestinians were killed in the conflict: 40 Israeli military and 67 civilians were killed; some 350 Palestinian militants, 452 civilians and 18 unknown were killed. While a number of the Palestinian militants were killed when carrying out an attack, many were killed in IDF raids on Palestinian neighbourhoods or at arrest attempts.

===Sharon&#x27;s announcement of the disengagement plan===
On 14 April 2004, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wrote a letter to US President George W. Bush, in which he reconfirmed his commitment to the Roadmap. He also accused the Palestinian Authority of not carrying out its part of the responsibilities under the Roadmap. Stating that &quot;there exists no Palestinian partner with whom to advance peacefully toward a settlement&quot;, Sharon announced his unilateral disengagement plan (Israeli withdrawal from Gaza), which meant the removal of all Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip and four settlements in the West Bank. The plan was already suggested by him on 18 December 2003 at the Fourth Herzliya Conference.

Although not undertaken under the Roadmap, Sharon declared this unilateral step not inconsistent with it. President Bush gave his support to the plan, calling it &quot;a bold and historic initiative that can make an important contribution to peace&quot;.

===Shifting U.S. position===
Until 2004, the official U.S. position had been that Israel, in principle, should return to the 1949 armistice lines (the Green Line) and that changes to these lines must be mutually agreed to in final-status negotiations. Israel&#x27;s ongoing settlement activities were criticised, because they prejudiced final-status negotiations.

In his answer on the 14 April letter from Ariel Sharon, Bush took some distance from this principle. He said &quot;In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949... It is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities.&quot;

Regarding the Palestinian refugees Bush said that &quot;It seems clear that an agreed, just, fair and realistic framework for a solution to the Palestinian refugee issue as part of any final status agreement will need to be found through the establishment of a Palestinian state and the settling of Palestinian refugees there rather than in Israel.&quot;

The letter was widely seen as a triumph for Sharon, since Bush seemed to accept Israel&#x27;s policy of facts on the ground, the view that the passage of time and new realities (Israeli settlements in the West Bank) obviated Israel&#x27;s obligation to withdraw more or less to the 1967 lines in return for peace, recognition and security.

In a 26 May 2005 joint press conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in the White House Rose Garden, President Bush said: &quot;Any final status agreement must be reached between the two parties, and changes to the 1949 armistice lines must be mutually agreed to. A viable two-state solution must ensure contiguity of the West Bank, and a state of scattered territories will not work. There must also be meaningful linkages between the West Bank and Gaza. This is the position of the United States today, it will be the position of the United States at the time of final status negotiations.&quot;

This statement was widely seen as a triumph for Abbas, as many commentators view it as contradictory to his 14 April 2004 letter. The Bush administration made no attempts to clarify any perceived discrepancies between the two statements.

===Armed activity and military actions===
While the Palestinians persisted in violent attacks against Israelis, Israel executed major military operations in Gaza. In 2004, most Israeli civilians were killed in 6 bomb attacks inside Israel. The Israeli army invaded and besieged southern Gaza in May in Operation Rainbow, invaded and besieged Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza in the summer in a 37 days long raid, and invaded northern Gaza again from 29 September to 16 October in Operation Days of Penitence.

==Reform of the PA structure==

===Bush&#x27;s call for new leaders===
The Roadmap was based on president Bush&#x27;s idea that Palestinian terror was the primary obstacle for an Israeli–Palestinian peace agreement, that the Palestinian authorities (PA) were encouraging terrorism, and that the dismantling of the current Palestinian leadership was a prerequisite for a Palestinian state. In his speech of 24 June 2002, Bush said:

Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership, so that a Palestinian state can be born. I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. ... And when the Palestinian people have new leaders, new institutions and new security arrangements with their neighbors, the United States of America will support the creation of a Palestinian state whose borders and certain aspects of its sovereignty will be provisional until resolved as part of a final settlement in the Middle East. ... Today, Palestinian authorities are encouraging, not opposing, terrorism. ... The Palestinian Authority has rejected your [the Israeli] offer at hand, and trafficked with terrorists.

Israel agreed. It wanted to expel Arafat, but the US opposed. Instead it was suggested to create the post of Prime Minister. In October 2003, the Government declared that &quot;Arafat is the main obstacle for any progress in the Middle East peace process.&quot; Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said there is no hope for a political settlement &quot;as long as [Arafat] is around&quot;, but he considered expelling Arafat not good for Israel.

===Introduction of a Prime Minister===
Although President Arafat had undertaken significant reform steps since May 2002, the process stalled from March 2003 due to both Israeli measures and internal political factors. In March 2003, President Arafat nominated Mahmoud Abbas for the post of the first Prime Minister. On 29 April, the Palestinian Parliament approved the appointment of the PM and his new Government. However, a struggle for power between Abbas and Arafat as well as members of the old clique paralysed the new government. Abbas was in a weak position, due to his failing to counter the Israelis, who refused to release prisoners and continued with the occupation of Palestinian cities, settlement activities, assassinations and incursions, and the maintenance of checkpoints. Abbas resigned in September 2003. Also under his successor Ahmed Qurei (Abu Alaa), the needed reform did not appear. An international task force concluded that only general elections could transform the political system, which, however, was impossible under the continued Israeli occupation. After Arafat&#x27;s death in November 2004, Abbas was elected as the second President of the Palestinian Authority.

===PA&#x27;s role towards terror and Israeli reactions===
The PA was created by the Oslo Accords and set out in detail. The PA was committed to combat Palestinian terror. Yet, its Security Forces were banned from Area C, some 60% of the West Bank, where Israel has exclusive responsibility for security control. Moreover, they were not able to move freely between all parts of the Palestinian controlled areas, which were splintered into more than 160 enclaves within Area C. Nevertheless, Israel held the PA, notably President Arafat, responsible for terrorist attacks committed by militant groups who were not affiliated with him. After two suicide bombings in Israel and Jerusalem executed by Hamas members, the Israeli security Cabinet decided on 11 September 2003 that &quot;Israel will act to remove this obstacle [Arafat] in the manner, at the time, and in the ways that will be decided on separately&quot;.

Israel on principle refused to accept cease-fires with militant groups, because &quot;Israel deals only with the Palestinian Authority&quot; and &quot;the Israelis don&#x27;t deal with these terrorist organizations&quot;, while advancing its policy of targeted killing. Instead, Israel reacted on terrorist attacks by attacking the PA&#x27;s Security Forces and its offices.

When the Second Intifada began, Israel started with the systematic destruction of security service&#x27;s offices until 90% of them were destroyed by 2003, and about three-quarters of the national security officers were locked up in Israeli detention camps, others were killed. Israeli attacks were mainly concentrated on Palestinian security forces, even though Hamas was responsible for a majority of the bombings and shootings. The siege of Arafat&#x27;s compound, which started in March 2002 during Operation Defensive Shield was maintained in 2003 and 2004, until Arafat died in a mysterious way.

With the destruction of hundreds of PA offices, like the Education Ministry, the Higher Education Ministry and the Health Ministry, along with equipment, computers and dossiers, the IDF wiped out the public data banks, according to Amira Hass apparently to destroy Palestinian civil institutions, sabotaging for years to come the Palestinian goal for independence.

==Expanding West Bank settlement==
Israel did not withdraw to the positions of 28 September 2000, a key requirement of Phase I of the Roadmap. Instead, movement of Palestinians was heavily impeded by numerous roadblocks, earth mounds and checkpoints, and movement between West Bank and Gaza was virtually impossible. According to Israel, the Palestinians did not fulfil their obligation to end violence and terrorism, and therefore they refused to withdraw.
Israel also did not freeze settlement expansion, nor dismantle outposts built since 2001, another requirement of the Roadmap. Instead, the number of settlers continued growing. Even during the &quot;Second Intifada&quot; the settler population kept growing at a high rate, in a remarkably straight line. From 2000 to 2004, the number of settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem increased with more than 50,000. From 2004 to 2008, the Jewish population grew with some 70,000.
However, the total construction in the settlements from 2004 to 2008 was only 6,868 housing units in the four years.

Additionally, more Palestinian land was confiscated and annexed by means of the expanding West Bank barrier. Despite a ruling of the International Court of Justice, who declared the barrier beyond the Green Line illegal, Israel decided to build the Wall up to 22 km inside the West Bank, east of Ariel, and east of other large settlement blocs. On the other hand, more than 1,500 Palestinian homes were demolished throughout the Palestinian Territories, and build-up of Palestinian structures was virtually completely denied.

==British involvement==
Until 2003, British intelligence officer Alastair Crooke played an important role as mediator between Israel and the Palestinians. He realized ceasefires and truces until he was recalled in August 2003.

According to Crooke, the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair played an important role in the development of a 2003 MI6 plan for a wide-ranging crackdown on Hamas. It was a &quot;Palestinian Security Plan&quot;, drawn up to implement Phase I of the Roadmap. The aim was to stop violent attacks by Hamas, including suicide bombings and the firing of Qassam rockets on South Israel.

The plan also mentioned the Israeli requirements of the Roadmap: &quot;an end to &#x27;deportations, attacks on civilians, confiscation and/or demolition of Palestinian homes and property ... (and) destruction of Palestinian institutions and infrastructure&#x27;. To these we would add assassinations and construction of the wall/fence within the Occupied Territories.&quot; The document mentions the complaints of the international community about the IDF who destroyed new resources they provided to the Palestinian police force.

In March 2005, MI6 sent a detailed follow-up of the &quot;Palestinian Security Plan&quot;. This report notes that the NSF (Palestinian National Security Forces), who were assumed to prevent terror, were denied by the Israelis equipment, ammunition en freedom of movement.

After Tony Blair sent British Intelligence officers to the Gaza Strip, in August 2005, to persuade Palestinian terrorists to call a halt to their suicide bomb attacks against Israel, Israel sent a sharp protest to the UK, because it opposed dealing with Hamas.

When in March 2006 Hamas won the parliamentary elections, Israel and the international community did not accept a role for the political arm of Hamas until it renounced violence and recognized Israel.
As Hamas attacks and kidnappings continued, many Hamas leaders and politicians were detained by Israel, or assassinated by targeted killing. In June 2007, Hamas took control of Gaza in the Fatah–Hamas battle.

==Roadmap in the peace process==
In the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit on 8 February 2005, Israelis and Palestinians reconfirmed their commitment to the Roadmap. At the Annapolis Conference on 27 November 2007, both parties again expressed their commitment to the Roadmap. Despite intensive negotiations in the following months, the parties did not reach an agreement. The negotiations ended in September 2008 without result. When the Olmert government started a major assault on Gaza in December 2008 to stop rocket fire into Israel, dubbed Operation Cast Lead, the &quot;peace process&quot; completely collapsed.

After the end of President Bush&#x27;s term of office in January 2009, the Roadmap fell into the background. The main issues remained: the permanent status of the occupied territories in the West Bank, the ongoing expansion of the settlements, Palestinian terrorism, and the final borders of Israel.

<doc id="236952" wikidata="Q1623471" url="?curid=236952" title="Wallaroo">
<text>Wallaroo is a common name for several species of moderately large macropods, intermediate in size between the kangaroos and the wallabies. The word &quot;wallaroo&quot; is from the Dharug &quot;walaru&quot; with spelling influenced by the words &quot;kangaroo&quot; and &quot;wallaby&quot;.

== Description ==
Wallaroos are typically distinct species from kangaroos and wallabies. An exception is the antilopine wallaroo, which is commonly known as an antilopine kangaroo when large, an antilopine wallaby when small, or an antilopine wallaroo when of intermediate size.

== Species ==
Wallaroo may refer to one of several species in the genus &quot;Osphranter&quot;:

* The common wallaroo or wallaroo (&quot;Osphranter robustus&quot;) is the best-known species. There are four subspecies of the common wallaroo: the eastern wallaroo (&quot;O. r. robustus&quot;) and the euro (&quot;O. r. erubescens&quot;), which are both widespread, and two of more restricted range, one from Barrow Island (the Barrow Island wallaroo (&quot;O. r. isabellinus&quot;)), the other from the Kimberley region (the Kimberley wallaroo (&quot;O. r. woodwardi&quot;)).
* The black wallaroo (&quot;O. bernardus&quot;) occupies an area of steep, rocky ground in Arnhem Land. At around in length (excluding tail) it is the smallest wallaroo and the most heavily built. Males weigh , females about . Because it is very wary and is found only in a small area of remote and very rugged country, it is little-known.
* The antilopine wallaroo &quot;(O. antilopinus&quot;), also known as the antilopine kangaroo or the antilopine wallaby, is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands and is gregarious, unlike other wallaroos which are solitary.

<doc id="236957" wikidata="Q610878" url="?curid=236957" title="Pancor Jackhammer">
<text>The Pancor Corporation Jackhammer is a 12-gauge, blow-forward gas-operated bullpup automatic shotgun designed in 1984 and patented in 1987. Only three working prototypes of the Jackhammer were built. Nonetheless, its distinctive aesthetics and futuristic design have made it popular as a weapon in many video games, notably &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, &quot;Max Payne&quot;, &quot;Project I.G.I&quot; and &quot;Far Cry&quot;. The firearm weapon utilizes semi automatic and fully automatic action and frequently a source of a Mandela effect, notably on the aspect of the firearm being a cinematic staple of the action series, despite IMFDB has not found credible evidence of the weapon appearing in cinema. 

==Development==
The Jackhammer was designed by John A. Anderson, who formed the company Pancor Industries in New Mexico. Anderson designed it based on his experiences using pump action shotguns in the Korean War and believed he could create a better shotgun, finding reloading pump action shotguns awkward and time consuming. Reportedly, several foreign governments expressed interest in the design and even ordered initial production units once ready for delivery. However, export of the design was held up for production due to United States Department of Defense testing, though the design was eventually rejected. 

Testing was done by HP White Labs in destructive tests (destroying two of the three produced). Those sent to HP White Labs reportedly had of material removed with increased stamping instead of casting and a different easier method of reloading. Thus the sole surviving example is not indicative of what would&#x27;ve been an actual production model and is better considered a tool room prototype. Several dozen non-functioning examples were made from sheet tin, balsa wood, and clay in order to make working tool prototypes. 

Civilian sales were made impossible by the classification in the US of the Jackhammer as a machine gun and restrictions on machine gun manufacture enacted in 1986. Additionally those foreign governments that did express interest were unwilling to finance development and final production. With no customers and little interest, Pancor went bankrupt. Supposed overseas orders were subject to United States Department of State approval that was not forthcoming. The assets of Pancor were sold off, including the few prototypes built.

A toolroom prototype that is in technical firing condition, but is constructed largely with machine screws and requires disassembly to reload, was owned by Movie Gun Services, during which its forearm was replaced with an MP5SD handguard. This example has since been auctioned. Another prototype with more refined construction, though non-functional, was legally registered as a machine gun and has also been seen auctioned.

==Design==

Though unconventional, the Jackhammer can best be described as a gas-operated revolver. Many parts were constructed of Rynite polymer to reduce weight. Layout was of a bullpup configuration with a 10-round revolving cylinder that fired conventional, 12-gauge shells. The cylinder&#x27;s method of rotation was very similar to the Webley–Fosbery Automatic Revolver, an operating rod being used to rotate the cylinder, although gas-operated as opposed to the recoil operation of the Webley-Fosbery.

The Jackhammer is capable of semi-automatic and fully automatic fire by way of a thumb safety/selector switch. At the moment of firing, the front of the shell sealed inside the breech of the barrel much like the Nagant M1895 revolver. Unlike the Nagant, whose cylinder moved forward to form the seal, the barrel of the Jackhammer was driven forward and away from the cylinder by a ring-piston, using gas tapped from the bore. As the barrel moved forward, the breech cleared the front of the fired cartridge and an operating rod attached to the barrel rotated the cylinder through a &quot;zig-zag&quot; cam arrangement. As the next shell aligned with the bore, the barrel returned under spring pressure back into the front end of the cylinder. Spent shells were retained in the cylinder, as in a traditional revolver. The Jackhammer has a charging handle in the forward grip to charge the weapon and a cocking lever in the buttstock to recock the firing mechanism in case of light strikes to the primer. For reloading, the cylinder was removed from the bottom of its housing and shells were manually extracted. Removing the cylinder required the barrel be moved and secured in the forward position.
==Bear Trap anti-personnel device ==
Unique to the Jackhammer was the ability to convert a loaded cylinder from the weapon into an anti-personnel device similar to a land mine by the addition of a firing mechanism. The cylinder would be loaded with up to ten 12-gauge shells and the firing mechanism fitted over the bottom section of the cylinder. A pressure plate or plunger can then set to mechanically fire the shells in the cylinder upon pressing or initiate a spring-loaded timer which can be set to trigger firing up to twelve hours later, in one hour intervals. As the cylinder is designed to contain the pressure of firing normally, it can be discharged and reused when used in Bear Trap configuration.

There is some disagreement over whether working models of the Bear Trap were built. According to Ian McCollum of &quot;Forgotten Weapons&quot;, no working prototypes were produced, however plastic model prototypes were produced and reportedly worked well. However, according to Jane&#x27;s, development of the Bear Trap was fully completed as of 1994.

<doc id="236960" wikidata="Q930428" url="?curid=236960" title="X3D">
<text>X3D (Extensible 3D) is a set of royalty-free ISO/IEC standards for declaratively representing 3D computer graphics. X3D includes multiple graphics file formats, programming-language API definitions, and run-time specifications for both delivery and integration of interactive network-capable 3D data. X3D version 4.0 has been approved by Web3D Consortium, and is under final review by ISO/IEC as a revised International Standard (IS).

X3D is specifically designed to work across diverse devices by using the Web Architecture. X3D provides a range of 3D functionality through Profiles, from basic asset Interchange and CADInterchange to Interactive, MPEG-4 Interactive, Medical, Immersive, and Full Profiles. Anatomically thorough support is also available for Humanoid Animation (HAnim) body structure and motion. The ‘X’ in X3D means Extensible: custom vendor and research component extensions can be added to standard functionality.

X3D file format support includes XML, ClassicVRML, Compressed Binary Encoding (CBE) and a draft JSON encoding. Semantic Web support has also been demonstrated by a Turtle encoding. X3D became the successor to the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) in 2001. X3D provides multiple extensions to VRML (e.g. CAD, geospatial, humanoid animation, NURBS, etc.), the ability to encode the scene using an XML syntax as well as the Open Inventor-like syntax of VRML97, or binary compression, with strongly typed APIs including ECMAScript, Java, Python and other programming languages.
X3D rendering includes both classic (e.g. Blinn-Phong) and modern physically based rendering (PBR) methods matching glTF 2.0 capabilities. Use of custom shaders using three platform-specific shader languages is also defined. Authors can employ rich multimedia capabilities including various image and movie formats. Fully spatialized aural rendering applies W3C Web Audio API capabilities, plus audio inputs digitized using MIDI 2.0 or other sound formats.

All X3D file encodings and programming-language APIs have equivalent expressive power, matching functional definitions in the X3D Architecture standard. Thus X3D can work with open standards including XML, Document Object Model (DOM), XPath and others.

== Example ==

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE X3D PUBLIC &quot;ISO//Web3D//DTD X3D 4.0//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-4.0.dtd&quot;&gt;

&lt;X3D profile=&quot;Interchange&quot; version=&quot;4.0&quot;
 xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
 xsd:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=&quot;http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-4.0.xsd&quot;&gt;
 &lt;Scene&gt;
 &lt;Shape DEF=&quot;MyTriangle&quot;&gt;
 &lt;IndexedFaceSet coordIndex=&quot;0 1 2&quot;&gt;
 &lt;Coordinate point=&quot;0 0 0 1 0 0 0.5 1 0&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/IndexedFaceSet&gt;
 &lt;/Shape&gt;
 &lt;/Scene&gt;
&lt;/X3D&gt;

The VRML representation is the same as , except that the version numbers are changed to reflect the latest X3D standard (codice_1). An identifying DEF name is also applied as a node identifier (id).

For JSON and binary formats, see Web3D for a list of tools.

==Applications==

There are several applications, most of which are open-source software, which natively parse and interpret X3D files, including the 3D graphics and animation editor Blender and the Sun Microsystems virtual world client Project Wonderland. An X3D applet is a software program that runs within a web browser and displays content in 3D, using OpenGL 3D graphics technology to display X3D content in several different browsers (IE, Safari, Firefox) across several different operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux). However, X3D has not received as wide acceptance as that of other, more notable software applications.

In the 2000s, many companies such as Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in X3D to the quality level of DirectX 9.0c, but at the expense of using proprietary solutions. All main features including game modeling are already complete. They include multi-pass render with low level setting for Z-buffer, BlendOp, AlphaOp, Stencil, Multi-texture, Shader with HLSL and GLSL support, real-time Render To Texture, Multi Render Target (MRT) and post-processing. Many demos shows that X3D already supports lightmap, normal mapping, SSAO, CSM and real-time environment reflection along with other virtual effects.

=== X3DOM ===
Striving to become the 3D standard for the Web, X3D is designed to be as integrated into HTML5 pages as other XML standards such as MathML and SVG. X3DOM is a proposed syntax model and its implementation as a script library that demonstrates how this integration can be achieved without a browser plugin, using only WebGL and JavaScript.

==Standardization==

X3D defines several profiles (sets of components) for various levels of capability including X3D Core, X3D Interchange, X3D Interactive, X3D CADInterchange, X3D Immersive, and X3D Full. Browser makers can define their own component extensions prior to submitting them for standardisation by the Web3D Consortium. Formal review and approval is then performed by ISO/IEC.

Liaison and cooperation agreements are also in place between the Web3D Consortium and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and the Khronos Group.

A subset of X3D is XMT-A, a variant of XMT, defined in MPEG-4 Part 11. It was designed to provide a link between X3D and 3D content in MPEG-4 (BIFS).

The abstract specification for X3D (ISO/IEC 19775) was first approved by the ISO in 2004. The XML and ClassicVRML encodings for X3D (ISO/IEC 19776) were first approved in 2005.

<text>Steven Eric Meretzky (born May 1, 1957) is an American video game developer. He is best known for creating Infocom games in the early 1980s, including collaborating with author Douglas Adams on the interactive fiction game of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, one of the first games to be certified &quot;platinum&quot; by the Software Publishers Association. Later, he created the Spellcasting trilogy, the flagship adventure series of Legend Entertainment. He has been involved in almost every aspect of game development, from design to production to quality assurance and box design.

His keen wit, prose, and coding skill made him one of the first interactive fiction writers (along with Dave Lebling) admitted to the Science Fiction Writers of America, and in September 1999, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; magazine named Meretzky as one of their twenty-five &quot;Game Gods&quot;; those who have made an indelible mark on the history of computer gaming.

== Biography ==

Meretzky was raised in Yonkers, New York. His father was trained as an accountant, but spent 25 years selling automotive hardware. Meretzky&#x27;s mother was a bookkeeper. He graduated from Yonkers High School in 1975. He went on to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in construction management in 1979. After working in the construction industry for two years, in 1981 Meretzky decided to pursue a career as a game tester for Infocom after co-founder Marc Blank asked Meretzky to take over the job from his roommate Mike Dornbrook. In 1983, he became a full-time writer (an &quot;Implementor&quot;), scripting &quot;Planetfall&quot; and creating the famous cult figure robot sidekick &quot;Floyd&quot;.

While working on &quot;Planetfall&quot;, people noted the similarities between his game and Douglas Adams&#x27; &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Meretzky listened to the radio series and enjoyed it, so he included a reference to the series in his game. In 1984, Meretzky collaborated with Adams over the course of three months in order to create a computer game adaption of Adams&#x27; series, which became one of the bestselling games of the era. A sequel to the game, titled &quot;Milliways: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; was proposed, but got cancelled due to the dwindling popularity of text adventure games.

Another popular game was &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot;, whose risque writing pushed the boundaries of the art. In an interview, Meretzky said that he originally just wrote the name on a project board as a joke, but was later asked to actually develop a game to go along with the title.

In &quot;A Mind Forever Voyaging&quot;, Meretzky attempted to address social issues, but Infocom&#x27;s success was declining, and the 1988 &quot;Zork Zero&quot; was his last title there.

In 1988 Meretzky had his son Daniel Meretzky. 

In 1994, Meretzky co-founded Boffo Games with Michael Dornbrook and Leo DaCosta, and developed such titles as the story puzzle game &quot;Hodj &#x27;n&#x27; Podj&quot; and the detective comedy &quot;The Space Bar&quot; until the company closed its doors in 1997. In 1998, he worked as a consultant on Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s canceled adventure game &quot;Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans&quot;.

Around the year 2000, Meretzky joined WorldWinner as a game advisor and Principal Game Designer. Meretzky is also a charter member of the Computer Game Developers Association, and a frequent speaker at industry conferences such as GDC.

Meretzky appears as himself antagonizing rapper MC Frontalot in the music video for &quot;It Is Pitch Dark.&quot; (released on &quot;Secrets from the Future&quot;). The song references several of Meretzky&#x27;s text adventure games, and the video is directed by documentarian Jason Scott Sadofsky, whose film &quot;GET LAMP&quot; is about the genre.

Several years later, Meretzky joined Blue Fang Games to work on the popular &quot;Zoo Tycoon&quot; franchise. He was employed as a Vice President of Design at social media game developer Playdom from 2008 to 2013, at which point he became Vice President of Creative at GSN Games. In November 2016 he became Vice President of Games at Swedish mobile game company King.

On October 28, 2022, Meretzky along with Leo DaCosta and Michael Dornbrook, re-formed Boffo Games as Boffo Intergalactic Games, and digitally re-released &quot;The Space Bar&quot; on ZOOM-Platform.com. This version of the game was based on an unreleased DVD version with higher resolution cinematic visuals and improved audio.

<doc id="236963" wikidata="Q134861" url="?curid=236963" title="Lissamphibia">
<text>The Lissamphibia (from Greek λισσός (lissós, &quot;smooth&quot;) + ἀμφίβια (amphíbia), meaning &quot;smooth amphibians&quot;) is a group of tetrapods that includes all modern amphibians. Lissamphibians consist of three living groups: the Salientia (frogs and their extinct relatives), the Caudata (salamanders and their extinct relatives), and the Gymnophiona (the limbless caecilians and their extinct relatives).

Salientians and caudatans are likely more closely related to each other than to caecilians. The name Batrachia is commonly used for the clade combining salientians and caudatans. A fourth group, the Allocaudata (also known as Albanerpetontidae) is also known, spanning 160 million years from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Pleistocene, but became extinct two million years ago.

For several decades, this name has been used for a group that includes all living amphibians, but excludes all the main groups of Paleozoic tetrapods, such as Temnospondyli, Lepospondyli, Embolomeri, and Seymouriamorpha. Most scientists have concluded that all of the primary groups of modern amphibians—frogs, salamanders and caecilians—are closely related.

Some writers have argued that the early Permian dissorophoid &quot;Gerobatrachus hottoni&quot; is a lissamphibian. If it is not, the earliest known lissamphibians are &quot;Triadobatrachus&quot; and &quot;Czatkobatrachus&quot; from the Early Triassic.

==Characteristics==

Some, if not all, lissamphibians share the following characteristics. Some of these apply to the soft body parts, hence do not appear in fossils. However, the skeletal characteristics also appear in several types of Palaeozoic amphibians:
* Double or paired occipital condyles
* Two types of skin glands (mucous and granular)
* Fat bodies associated with gonads
* Double-channeled sensory in the inner ear
* Green rods (a special type of visual cell, unknown in caecilians)
* Ribs do not encircle body. In anurans the ribs are fused to their vertebrae, except in the suborder Archaeobatrachia which still has free ribs.
* Ability to elevate the eyes (with the levator bulbi muscle)
* Forced-pump respiratory mechanism, the primitive breathing system also found in labyrinthodont amphibians
* Cylindrical centra (the main body of the vertebrae; cylindrical centra are also found in several groups of early tetrapods)
* Pedicellate teeth (the crowns of the teeth are separated from the roots by a zone of fibrous tissue; also found in some Dissorophoidea; the teeth of some fossil salamanders are not pedicellate)
* Bicuspid teeth (two cusps per tooth, also found in juvenile dissorophoids)
* Operculum (small bone in the skull, linked to shoulder girdle by the opercularis muscle; perhaps involved in hearing and balance; absent in caecilians and some salamanders, fused to the columella (ear bone) in most anurans)
* Loss of posterior skull bones (also in Microsauria and Dissorophoidea)
* Small, widely separated pterygoid bones (also found in Temnospondyli and Nectridea)
* Wide cultriform process of the parasphenoid (also found in some Microsauria (&quot;Rhynchonkos&quot;) and Lysorophia)
*Presence of ampullae of Lorenzini in some salamanders and caecilians, but never in frogs

==Relationships and definition==
The features uniting the Lissamphibia were first noted by Ernst Haeckel, even though in Haeckel&#x27;s work, Lissamphibia excluded the caecilians. Nevertheless, Haeckel considered the caecilians to be closely related to what he called Lissamphibia (gr. λισσός, smooth), which is now called Batrachia and includes frogs and salamanders. In the early to mid 20th century, a biphyletic origin of amphibians (and thus of tetrapods in general) was favoured. In the late 20th century, a flood of new fossil evidence mapped out in some detail the nature of the transition between the elpistostegalid fish and the early amphibians. Most herpetologists and paleontologists, therefore, no longer accept the view that amphibians have arisen twice, from two related but separate groups of fish. The question then arises whether Lissamphibia is monophyletic as well. The origin and relationships of the various lissamphibian groups both with each other and among other early tetrapods remain controversial. Not all paleontologists today are convinced that Lissamphibia is indeed a natural group, as there are important characteristics shared with some non-lissamphibian Palaeozoic amphibians.

Currently, the two prevailing theories of lissamphibian origin are:
* Monophyletic within Temnospondyli
* Monophyletic within Lepospondyli

One of the hypotheses regarding their ancestors is that they evolved by paedomorphosis and miniaturization from early tetrapods.

Molecular studies of extant amphibians based on multiple-locus data favor one or the other of the monophyletic alternatives and indicate a Late Carboniferous date for the divergence of the lineage leading to caecilians from the one leading to frogs and salamanders, and an early Permian date for the separation of the frog and salamander groups.

The stem-caecilian &quot;Funcusvermis&quot;, described in 2023, retained many dissorophoid temnospondyl features, supporting a monophyletic Lissamphibia within clade Temnospondyli.

<text>The Utah teapot, or the Newell teapot, is one of the standard reference test models in 3D modeling and an in-joke within the computer graphics community. It is a mathematical model of an ordinary Melitta-brand teapot designed by that appears solid with a nearly rotationally symmetrical body. Using a teapot model is considered the 3D equivalent of a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program, a way to create an easy 3D scene with a somewhat complex model acting as the basic geometry for a scene with a light setup. Some programming libraries, such as the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, even have functions dedicated to drawing teapots.

The teapot model was created in 1975 by early computer graphics researcher Martin Newell, a member of the pioneering graphics program at the University of Utah. It was one of the first to be modeled using Bézier curves rather than precisely measured.

==History==
For his work, Newell needed a simple mathematical model of a familiar object. His wife, Sandra Newell, suggested modelling their tea set since they were sitting down for tea at the time. He sketched the teapot free-hand using graph paper and a pencil. Following that, he went back to the computer laboratory and edited bézier control points on a Tektronix storage tube, again by hand. 

The teapot shape contained a number of elements that made it ideal for the graphics experiments of the time: it was round, contained saddle points, had a genus greater than zero because of the hole in the handle, could project a shadow on itself, and could be displayed accurately without a surface texture.

Newell made the mathematical data that described the teapot&#x27;s geometry (a set of three-dimensional coordinates) publicly available, and soon other researchers began to use the same data for their computer graphics experiments. These researchers needed something with roughly the same characteristics that Newell had, and using the teapot data meant they did not have to laboriously enter geometric data for some other object. Although technical progress has meant that the act of rendering the teapot is no longer the challenge it was in 1975, the teapot continued to be used as a reference object for increasingly advanced graphics techniques.

Over the following decades, editions of computer graphics journals (such as the ACM SIGGRAPH&#x27;s quarterly) regularly featured versions of the teapot: faceted or smooth-shaded, wireframe, bumpy, translucent, refractive, even leopard-skin and furry teapots were created.

Having no surface to represent its base, the original teapot model was not intended to be seen from below. Later versions of the data set fixed this.

The real teapot is 33% taller (ratio 4:3) than the computer model. Jim Blinn stated that he scaled the model on the vertical axis during a demo in the lab to demonstrate that they could manipulate it. They preferred the appearance of this new version and decided to save the file out of that preference.

Versions of the teapot model — or sample scenes containing it — are distributed with or freely available for nearly every current rendering and modelling program and even many graphic APIs, including AutoCAD, Houdini, Lightwave 3D, MODO, POV-Ray, 3ds Max, and the OpenGL and Direct3D helper libraries. Some RenderMan-compliant renderers support the teapot as a built-in geometry by calling codice_1. Along with the expected cubes and spheres, the GLUT library even provides the function codice_2 as a graphics primitive, as does its Direct3D counterpart D3DX (codice_3). While D3DX for Direct3D 11 does not provide this functionality anymore, it is supported in the DirectX Tool Kit. Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard also include the teapot as part of Quartz Composer; Leopard&#x27;s teapot supports bump mapping. BeOS and Haiku include a small demo of a rotating 3D teapot, intended to show off the platform&#x27;s multimedia facilities.
Teapot scenes are commonly used for renderer self-tests and benchmarks.

===Original teapot model===
The original, physical Melitta teapot was purchased from ZCMI (a department store in Salt Lake City) in 1974. It was donated to the Boston Computer Museum in 1984, where it was on display until 1990. It now resides in the ephemera collection at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California where it is catalogued as &quot;Teapot used for Computer Graphics rendering&quot; and bears the catalogue number X00398.1984. The original teapot the Utah teapot was based on was available from Porzellanfabrik Friesland, once part of the German Melitta group. Originally it was given the rather plain name (&#x27;household teapot&#x27;); the company only found out about their product&#x27;s reputation in 2017, whereupon they officially renamed it &quot;Utah Teapot&quot;. It was available in three different sizes and various colors; the one Martin Newell had used is the white &quot;1.4 l Utah Teapot&quot;.

The original teapot is no longer in production, following a fire at Friesland Porzellan.

==Appearances==

One famous ray-traced image, by James Arvo and David Kirk in 1987, shows six stone columns, five of which are surmounted by the Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron). The sixth column supports a teapot. The image is titled &quot;The Six Platonic Solids&quot;, with Arvo and Kirk calling the teapot &quot;the newly discovered Teapotahedron&quot;. This image appeared on the covers of several books and computer graphic journals.

The Utah teapot sometimes appears in the &quot;Pipes&quot; screensaver shipped with Microsoft Windows, but only in versions prior to Windows XP, and has been included in the &quot;polyhedra&quot; XScreenSaver hack since 2008.

Jim Blinn (in one of his &quot;Project MATHEMATICS!&quot; videos) proves an amusing (but trivial) version of the Pythagorean theorem: construct a (2D) teapot on each side of a right triangle and the area of the teapot on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the teapots on the other two sides.

Vulkan and OpenGL graphics APIs feature the Utah teapot along with the Stanford dragon and the Stanford bunny on their badges.

With the advent of the first computer-generated short films, and later full-length feature films, it has become an in-joke to hide the Utah teapot in films&#x27; scenes. For example, in the movie &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the Utah teapot appears in a short tea-party scene. The teapot also appears in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror VI&quot; in which Homer discovers the &quot;third dimension.&quot; In &quot;The Sims 2&quot;, a picture of the Utah teapot is one of the paintings available to buy in-game, titled &quot;Handle and Spout&quot;.

An origami version of the teapot, folded by Tomohiro Tachi, was shown at the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art in Israel in a 2007–2008 exhibit.

In Oct 2021 &quot;Smithfield Utah&quot; by Alan Butler which was inspired by the Utah teapot was unveiled in Dublin, Ireland.

==OBJ conversion==
Although the original tea set by Newell can be downloaded directly, this tea set is specified using a set of Bézier patches in a custom format, which can be difficult to import directly into many popular 3D modeling applications. As such, a tesselated conversion of the dataset in the popular OBJ file format can be useful. One such conversion of the complete Newell teaset is available on the University of Utah website.

==3D printing==
Through 3D printing, the Utah Teapot has come full circle from being a computer model based on an actual teapot to being an actual teapot based on the computer model. It is widely available in many renderings in different materials from small plastic knick-knacks to a fully functional ceramic teapot. It is sometimes intentionally rendered as a low poly object to celebrate its origin as a computer model.

In 2009, a Belgian design studio, Unfold, 3D printed the Utah Teapot in ceramic with the objective of returning the iconographic teapot to its roots as a piece of functional dishware while showing its status as an icon of the digital world.

In 2015, the California-based company Emerging Objects followed suit, but this time printed the teapot, along with teacups and teaspoons, out of actual tea.

<doc id="236968" wikidata="Q516869" url="?curid=236968" title="Some Time in New York City">
<text>Some Time in New York City is the fourth collaborative studio album, and first live album by John Lennon and Yoko Ono as Plastic Ono Band, a double album, it includes backing by the American rock band Elephant&#x27;s Memory. Released in June 1972 in the US and in September 1972 in the UK on Apple Records, it is Lennon&#x27;s sixth album to be released under his own name, and his fourth collaboration with Ono. Like Lennon&#x27;s previous solo albums, it was co-produced by Lennon, Ono and Phil Spector. The album&#x27;s agitprop lyrics are politically charged compared to its predecessors, addressing political and social issues and topics such as sexism, incarceration, colonialism, and racism.

Recording for the album&#x27;s studio portion took place between December 1971 and March 1972 while the live portion, released as &quot;Live Jam&quot;, was recorded on 15 December 1969 at the Lyceum Ballroom in London for a UNICEF charity concert and on 6 June 1971 at Fillmore East in New York City. Musicians who contributed to the 1969 performance include Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Nicky Hopkins, Keith Moon and Klaus Voormann, while the 1971 performance features Frank Zappa and his band the Mothers of Invention.

Preceded by the single &quot;Woman Is the Nigger of the World&quot;, which caused controversy due to its title, &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; received scathing reviews on release and performed poorly commercially. Reviewers were especially critical of its politically charged content. Zappa was critical of Lennon and Ono&#x27;s handling of the recordings of the Mothers performance, eventually releasing his own version of the performance on &quot;Playground Psychotics&quot; (1992). &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; was reissued on compact disc in 2005 as a single album, removing several of the &quot;Live Jam&quot; songs while adding other non-album singles, and again on CD in 2010 in its original double album format.
==Background==
John Lennon and Yoko Ono moved to New York City in September 1971 and continued their involvement in political, peace and social justice causes of the counterculture era. When they settled in Greenwich Village, in October, they were quickly contacted by activists Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman who persuaded them to appear at an upcoming rally for left-wing writer John Sinclair, who had been jailed for possession of two marijuana joints. The Lennons also spoke out on the Attica Prison riots, jailing of Angela Davis and oppression of women. On 12 November, Lennon and Ono taped numerous demos of &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot;, which were videotaped by director John Reilly for a 17-minute documentary short titled &quot;Luck of the Irish – A Videotape by John Reilly&quot;. On 9 December, Lennon and Ono flew to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the John Sinclair rally, which was due to start the next day. Soon after their arrival, Lennon recorded &quot;Chords of Fame&quot; with Phil Ochs. At the rally itself, Lennon and Ono played four songs that would end up on &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;: &quot;Attica State&quot;, &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot;, &quot;Sisters O Sisters&quot; and &quot;John Sinclair&quot;. The performance was filmed, and included in the short film &quot;Ten for Two&quot; which was shown locally in Ann Arbor sometime in December.

Lennon and Ono, along with David Peel, performed Peel&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of New York&quot; on &quot;The David Frost Show&quot;, with Lennon playing tea-chest bass. The trio, now joined by The Lower East Side Band, played the same set of songs that Lennon and Ono had played at the John Sinclair rally, though the version of &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot; was shorter. This episode was recorded on 16 December 1971 and broadcast on 13 January 1972. The next day, Lennon and Ono performed at a benefit concert for families of victims of the Attica Prison riot at the Apollo Theater, playing acoustic versions of &quot;Imagine&quot;, &quot;Attica State&quot;, and &quot;Sisters, O Sisters&quot;.

==Recording==
The original double album contained the live album &quot;Live Jam&quot;, featuring the Plastic Ono Supergroup&#x27;s 15 December 1969 live performances of &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko (Mummy&#x27;s Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)&quot; at the Lyceum Ballroom in London, for a UNICEF charity show billed as the &quot;Peace for Christmas Concert&quot;. In addition to Lennon and Ono, the supergroup featured George Harrison, The Who&#x27;s drummer Keith Moon, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Billy Preston and Legs Larry Smith, among others. Harrison, who had been touring with Delaney &amp; Bonnie, received a phone call from Lennon and was excited about the prospect of performing with him. The ballroom had its interior covered by posters declaring &quot;WAR IS OVER, if you want it, love John and Yoko.&quot; For &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, Ono sat inside a white bag located near Lennon&#x27;s feet, later jumping out of the bag during &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko (Mummy&#x27;s Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)&quot;, facing the crowd and screaming at them. Toward the end of the latter performance, Ono broke down crying. An early mix of the two tracks was produced by the Abbey Road Studios engineers on 26 November 1970 and was sent to Lennon and Ono. The album also featured a recording of Lennon and Ono performing with Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention at the Fillmore East on 6 June 1971, a collaboration instigated by Andy Warhol. Ono arranged for the performance to be filmed, and Klaus Voormann overdubbed some of his bass parts at a later date.

Throughout January, until the 21st, Lennon mixed the live album at the Record Plant. Lennon also mixed the recordings of the John Sinclair rally, as well as the Apollo Theatre and Lyceum Ballroom performances, for possible release as EPs; however, only the Lyceum performance was released. Lennon and Ono, with the assistance of studio drummer Jim Keltner, hired Elephant&#x27;s Memory, a local band known for their hard partying and anti-establishment musical style, to back them for a series of albums and live performances. Lennon once again brought in Phil Spector to co-produce the new studio album, which was completed on 20 March 1972. Around this time, Lennon and Ono were producing Elephant&#x27;s Memory&#x27;s self-titled album. Several jams were recorded, featuring Lennon and Elephant&#x27;s Memory, all of which remained unreleased: &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, &quot;Send Me Some Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Me&quot;, &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; and &quot;Caribbean&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
The opening song of the studio album, &quot;Woman Is the Nigger of the World&quot; (a phrase Ono had coined in the late 1960s), was intended as a negation of sexism and was also issued as a single in the US to controversial reaction, and – as a consequence – little airplay. The Lennons went to great lengths (including a press conference attended by staff from &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;Ebony&quot; magazines) to explain that the word &quot;nigger&quot; was not meant as an affront to black people. A quote from Ron Dellums, referring to the use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, appeared in an issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; (referred to on an episode of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;). Lennon&#x27;s other tracks include the biographical &quot;New York City&quot;, a Chuck Berry-styled rocker that details the Lennons&#x27; early months in their new home, as well as &quot;John Sinclair&quot;, his musical plea for Sinclair&#x27;s release from a ten-year sentence for giving two marijuana joints to an undercover policewoman.

Ono, a feminist, responds musically with &quot;Sisters, O Sisters&quot;, tackles the lacking education system with &quot;Born in a Prison&quot;, and celebrates a culture of one in &quot;We&#x27;re All Water&quot;. Together, Lennon and Ono lament police brutality in &quot;Attica State&quot;, the hardships of war-torn Northern Ireland in &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot; (see Bloody Sunday), and pay tribute to Angela Davis with &quot;Angela&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; was issued in the US on 12 June 1972 but delayed until 15 September in the UK, due to a dispute with Northern Songs over publishing rights on songs co-written by Lennon and Ono. The album was packaged like a newspaper (an approach previously employed on The Four Seasons&#x27; &quot;The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette&quot;, Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;Volunteers&quot; and Jethro Tull&#x27;s &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;), depicting the events covered in the album&#x27;s songs, causing even more consternation with an image of Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong dancing nude together. (The photo was stickered over on many of the issued copies, with a non-removable seal.)

With most of the gatefold cover space taken up by printed lyrics and photographs, the album credits appeared on the first disc&#x27;s inner sleeve. The customised label, featuring the face of Lennon morphing into Ono&#x27;s, was created by Iain Macmillan. The inner sleeve for &quot;Live Jam&quot; featured Lennon&#x27;s doodling over the cover of Zappa&#x27;s album, &quot;Fillmore East - June 1971&quot;, adding his credits and commentary to Zappa&#x27;s.

Initial copies of the US edition included a photograph of the Statue of Liberty and a mailable petition to allow citizenship for John and Yoko. Also, the message &quot;John and Yoko forever Peace on earth and goodwill to all men &#x27;72&quot; is inscribed in the dead wax on Side 1.

Although the UK release managed a number 11 chart peak, it only went to number 48 in the US. Lennon was reportedly stunned by the album&#x27;s failure and consequently did not record new music for almost a year.

==Critical reception==

On release, &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; provided a startling contrast for listeners expecting a repeat of the well-received &quot;Imagine&quot; in 1971. According to author Robert Rodriguez, the new album received &quot;abysmal reviews&quot;. In a scathing critique published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote that &quot;the Lennons should be commended for their daring&quot;, but not before calling the album &quot;incipient artistic suicide&quot;. Holden added: &quot;except for &#x27;John Sinclair&#x27; the songs are awful. The tunes are shallow and derivative and the words little more than sloppy nursery-rhymes that patronise the issues and individuals they seek to exalt. Only a monomaniacal smugness could allow the Lennons to think that this witless doggerel wouldn&#x27;t insult the intelligence and feelings of &quot;any&quot; audience.&quot;

Dave Marsh wrote a mixed review for &quot;Creem&quot;, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s not half bad. It may be 49.9% bad, but not half.&quot; &quot;The Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; declared that John and Yoko had produced &quot;another crude, superficial look at trendy leftist politics and have plunged even further into their endless echo chamber&quot;. In the &quot;NME&quot;, Tony Tyler presented his album review in the form of an open letter, titled &quot;Lennon, you&#x27;re a pathetic, ageing revolutionary&quot;. After criticising Lennon for &quot;the general tastelessness of the presentation&quot;, particularly the album&#x27;s lyrics and cover art, Tyler concluded: &quot;Don&#x27;t rely on cant and rigidity. Don&#x27;t alienate. Stimulate. You know, like you used to.&quot;

More recently, Garry Mulholland of &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine has described &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; as &quot;a contender for the worst LP by a major musical figure, its list of &#x27;70s left-wing clichés hamstrung by the utter absence of conviction within the melodies and lyrics&quot;. Writing in the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; in 2005, Eliot Wilder said that listening to the album was &quot;a painful experience&quot;. Although he conceded that Lennon &quot;had his heart in the right place&quot;, Wilder opined: &quot;these tracks – pedantic, topical, elitist – show that a latter-day Dylan he was not ... Refer to the Beatles&#x27; &#x27;Revolution&#x27; or his own &#x27;Give Peace a Chance&#x27; if you need a dose of John the Protest Singer.&quot; More impressed, Mark Kemp of &quot;Paste&quot; considered that &quot;the album has been unfairly chastised&quot;, identifying &quot;Woman Is the Nigger of the World&quot; as &quot;one of Lennon&#x27;s finest songs&quot; and Ono&#x27;s &quot;Born in a Prison&quot; as another highlight.

==Legacy==
On 30 August 1972, Lennon and Ono performed two benefit concerts for the Willowbrook State School for the mentally challenged at Madison Square Garden, at friend Geraldo Rivera&#x27;s request. The shows, known as &quot;One to One&quot;, were filmed and recorded, with the evening show broadcast on ABC Television, and the earlier matinée show compiled for release as the 1986 live album and video, &quot;Live in New York City&quot;. New York mayor John Lindsay declared the date &quot;One to One Day&quot;, and the performances proved to be Lennon&#x27;s last full live concerts.

Frank Zappa criticized the presentation of the Mothers&#x27; performance on &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;, as the vocals of Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan had been removed, and Zappa did not receive writing credit for &quot;King Kong&quot;, which was wrongly identified on this release as &quot;Jamrag&quot;. He and Lennon had also agreed that each would release their own version of the performance, but Zappa was legally prevented from issuing his version, which did not appear until the release of &quot;Playground Psychotics&quot; in 1992.

After Lennon&#x27;s death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, released in the UK on 15 June 1981. &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; was remixed, remastered and reissued in November 2005 as a single CD, removing, in the process, several of the &quot;Live Jam&quot; cuts, while adding &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; and &quot;Listen, the Snow Is Falling&quot;. On this remastered release, &quot;John Sinclair&quot; and &quot;Attica State&quot; were not remixed. In 2010, the album was digitally remastered and reissued on CD in its original double album format. Another remix (part of the &quot;ultimate mix&quot; campaign following the &quot;Imagine&quot;, &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;, and &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; albums) was slated for 2022, but has been delayed due to unknown reasons.

==Track listing==

;Alternate version of Side 4
Frank Zappa&#x27;s version of the live recordings captured on side four of &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; was released in 1992 on Frank Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;Playground Psychotics&quot;. These mixes/edits make Zappa and his band more prominent in the mix (most notably in the song &quot;Scumbag&quot; where Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan&#x27;s vocals are audible) than they had been on &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;. In some cases the songs were given new titles: &quot;Say Please&quot; and &quot;Aaawk&quot; are edited from &quot;Jamrag&quot; (a longer piece on &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;), and &quot;Aü&quot; is retitled &quot;A Small Eternity with Yoko Ono&quot;. The songs, which appear as tracks 22 through 26 on disc one of the CD, are denoted as follows:

===2005 CD reissue===
This remixed/remastered edition, issued on a single disc, omits much of the live material with Zappa (though it is available in a different mix/edit on Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Playground Psychotics&quot;) and includes &quot;Listen, the Snow Is Falling&quot; &amp; &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; as bonus tracks. Some of the track times, notably for &quot;We&#x27;re All Water&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko&quot;, differ from those on the original vinyl LPs.

<text>Alfred Peter Friedrich von Tirpitz (; 19 March 1849 – 6 March 1930) was a German grand admiral and State Secretary of the German Imperial Naval Office, the powerful administrative branch of the German Imperial Navy from 1897 until 1916.

Prussia never had a major navy, nor did the other German states before the German Empire was formed in 1871. Tirpitz took the modest Imperial Navy and, starting in the 1890s, turned it into a world-class force that could threaten Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy. However, during World War I, his High Seas Fleet proved unable to end Britain&#x27;s command of the sea and its chokehold on Germany&#x27;s economy. The one great engagement at sea, the Battle of Jutland, ended in a narrow German tactical victory but a strategic failure. As the High Seas Fleet&#x27;s limitations became increasingly apparent during the war, Tirpitz became an outspoken advocate for unrestricted submarine warfare, a policy which would ultimately bring Germany into conflict with the United States. By the beginning of 1916, he was dismissed from office and never regained power. Following his dismissal, he would become Chairman of the far-right German Fatherland Party, an ideological precursor to the German National People&#x27;s Party.

==Family and early life==
Tirpitz was born in Küstrin (today Kostrzyn in Poland) in the Prussian province of Brandenburg, the son of lawyer and later judge Rudolf Tirpitz (1811–1905). His mother was the daughter of a doctor. Tirpitz grew up in Frankfurt (Oder). He recorded in his memoirs that as a child he was a mediocre pupil.

Tirpitz spoke English fluently and was sufficiently at home in Britain that he sent his two daughters Ilse and Margot to Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College.

On 18 November 1884 he married Maria Augusta Lipke (born 11 October 1860 in Schwetz, West Prussia, died after 1941). 
On 12 June 1900 he was elevated to the Prussian nobility, becoming von Tirpitz. He had four children: Max, Wolfgang, Ilse (born 1885) and Margot (born 1888). His son, &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Wolfgang von Tirpitz, was taken prisoner of war after the sinking of in the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. Ilse married diplomat Ulrich von Hassell who was executed in 1944 as an anti-Hitler activist. Their daughter and her young sons were then taken as hostages. She wrote of the experience in &quot;A Mother&#x27;s War&quot;.

==Naval career==
Tirpitz joined the Prussian Navy more by accident than design when a friend announced that he was doing so. Tirpitz decided he liked the idea and with the consent of his parents became a naval cadet at the age of 16, on 24 April 1865. He attended Kiel Naval School. Within a year Prussia was at war with Austria. Tirpitz became a midshipman (&quot;Seekadett&quot;) on 24 June 1866 and was posted to a sailing ship patrolling the English Channel. In 1866 Prussia became part of the North German Confederation, the navy officially became that of the confederation and Tirpitz joined the new institution on 24 June 1869.

On 22 September 1869 he had obtained the rank of &quot;Unterleutnant zur See&quot; (sub-lieutenant) and served on board the ironclad . During the Franco-Prussian War the Prussian Navy was greatly outnumbered and so the ship spent the duration of the war at anchor, much to the embarrassment of the navy. During the early years of Tirpitz&#x27;s career, Prussia and Great Britain were on good terms and the Prussian Navy spent much time in British ports. Tirpitz reported that Plymouth was more hospitable to German sailors than was Kiel, while it was also easier to obtain equipment and supplies there, which were of better quality than available at home. At this time the British Royal Navy was pleased to assist that of Prussia in its development and Prussian officers had considerable respect for their British counterparts.

===Development of torpedoes===
Unification of Germany in 1871 again meant a change of name, to the German Imperial Navy. On 25 May 1872 Tirpitz was promoted to &quot;Leutnant zur See&quot; (lieutenant at sea) and on 18 November 1875 to &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; (captain-lieutenant). In 1877 he was chosen to visit the Whitehead Torpedo Works at Fiume and afterwards was placed in charge of the German torpedo section, later renamed the Torpedo Inspectorate. By 1879 a working device had been produced, but even under demonstration conditions Tirpitz reckoned it was as likely to miss a target as to hit it. On 17 September 1881 he became &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; (corvette captain). From developing torpedoes, Tirpitz moved on to developing torpedo boats to deliver them. The State Secretary for the Navy, Leo von Caprivi, was a distant relation, and Tirpitz now worked with him on the development of tactics. Caprivi envisioned that the boats would be used defensively against their most likely enemy, France, but Tirpitz set about developing plans to attack the French home port of Cherbourg-en-Cotentin. Tirpitz later described his time with torpedo boats as &quot;the eleven best years of my life&quot;.

===Strategic development of the navy===
In 1887 the torpedo boats escorted Prince Wilhelm to attend the Golden Jubilee celebrations of his grandmother, Queen Victoria. This was the first time Tirpitz met Wilhelm. In July 1888 Caprivi was succeeded by Alexander von Monts. Torpedo boats were no longer considered important, and Tirpitz requested transfer, commanding the ironclads and then . He was promoted to captain (&quot;Kapitän zur See&quot;) 24 November 1888 and in 1890 became chief of staff of the Baltic Squadron. On one occasion the Kaiser was attending dinner with the senior naval officers at Kiel and asked their opinion on how the navy should develop. Finally the question came to Tirpitz and he advised building battleships. This was an answer which appealed to the Kaiser, and nine months later he was transferred to Berlin to work on a new strategy for creating a high seas fleet. Tirpitz appointed a staff of officers he had known from his time with the torpedo boats and collected together all sorts of vessels as stand-in battleships to conduct exercises to test out tactics. On 1 December 1892 he made a presentation of his findings to the Kaiser. This brought him into conflict with the Navy State Secretary, Admiral Friedrich von Hollmann. Hollmann was responsible for procurement of ships, and had a policy of collecting ships as funding permitted. Tirpitz had concluded that the best fighting arrangement was a squadron of eight identical battleships, rather than any other combination of ships with mixed abilities. Further ships should then be added in groups of eight. Hollmann favoured a mixed fleet including cruisers for long-distance operations overseas. Tirpitz believed that in a war no number of cruisers would be safe unless backed up by sufficient battleships.

&quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; (captain at sea) Tirpitz became chief of the naval staff in 1892 and was made a &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (rear admiral) in 1895.

In autumn 1895, frustrated by the non-adoption of his recommendations, Tirpitz asked to be replaced. The Kaiser, not wishing to lose him, asked instead that he prepare a set of recommendations for ship construction. This was delivered on 3 January 1896, but the timing was bad as it coincided with raids into the Transvaal in Southern Africa by pro-British forces against the pro-German Boers. The Kaiser immediately set his mind to demanding cruisers which could operate at a distance and influence the war. Hollman was tasked with obtaining money from the Reichstag for a building programme, but failed to gain funding for enough ships to satisfy anyone. Imperial Chancellor Hohenlohe saw no sense in naval enlargement and reported back that the Reichstag opposed it. Admiral Gustav von Senden-Bibran, Chief of the Naval Cabinet, advised that the only possibility lay in replacing Hollmann: Wilhelm impulsively decided to appoint Tirpitz.

Meanwhile, however, Hollmann had obtained funding for one battleship and three large cruisers. It was felt that replacing him before the bill had completed approval through the Reichstag would be a mistake. Instead, Tirpitz was placed in charge of the German East Asia Squadron in the Far East but with a promise of appointment as secretary at a suitable moment. The cruiser squadron operated from British facilities in Hong Kong which were far from satisfactory as the German ships always took second place for available docks. Tirpitz was instructed to find a suitable site for a new port, selecting four possible sites. Although he initially favoured the bay at Kiautschou/Tsingtao, others in the naval establishment advocated a different location and even Tirpitz wavered on his commitment in his final report. A &quot;lease&quot; on the land was acquired in 1898 after it was fortuitously occupied by German forces. On 12 March 1896 the Reichstag cut back Hollmann&#x27;s appropriation of 70 million marks to 58 million, and Hollman offered his resignation. Tirpitz was summoned home and offered the post of secretary of the Imperial Navy office (&quot;Reichsmarineamt&quot;). He went home the long way, touring the United States on the way and arriving in Berlin 6 June 1897. He was pessimistic of his chances of succeeding with the Reichstag.

===State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office===
On 15 June Tirpitz presented a memorandum on the makeup and purpose of the German fleet to the Kaiser. This defined the principal enemy as Great Britain, and the principal area of conflict to be that between Heligoland and the Thames. Cruiser warfare around the globe was deemed impractical because Germany had few bases to resupply ships, while the chief need was for as many battleships as possible to take on the British fleet. A target was outlined for two squadrons of eight battleships, plus a fleet flagship and two reserves. This was to be completed by 1905 and cost 408 million marks, or 58 million per year, the same as the existing budget. The proposal was innovative in several ways. It made a clear statement of naval needs, whereas before the navy had grown piecemeal. It set out the programme for seven years ahead, which neither the Reichstag nor the navy should change. It defined a change in German foreign policy so as to justify the existence of the fleet: Great Britain up to this point had been friendly, now it was officially an enemy. The Kaiser agreed to the plan and Tirpitz retired to St Blasien in the Black Forest with a team of naval specialists to draft a naval bill for presentation to the Reichstag. Information about the plan leaked out to Admiral Knorr, head of the Naval High Command. Tirpitz agreed to a joint committee to discuss changes in the navy, but then arranged that it never receive any information. Similarly, he arranged a joint committee with the Treasury State Secretary to discuss finance, which never discussed anything. Meanwhile, he continued his best efforts to convince the Kaiser and Chancellor, so that in due course he could announce the issues had already been decided at a higher level and thereby avoid debate.

Once the bill was nearly complete Tirpitz started a round of visits to obtain support. First he visited the former chancellor and elder statesman, Prince Bismarck. Armed with the announcement that the Kaiser intended to name the next ship launched &quot;Furst Bismarck&quot;, he persuaded the former chancellor, who had been dismissed from office for disagreement with Wilhelm II, to modestly support the proposals. Tirpitz now visited the King of Saxony, the Prince Regent of Bavaria, the Grand Duke of Baden and Oldenburg and the councils of the Hanseatic towns. On 19 October the draft bill was sent to the printers for presentation to the Reichstag. Tirpitz&#x27;s approach was to be as accommodating with the deputies as he could. He was patient and good humoured, proceeding on the assumption that if everything was explained carefully, then the deputies would naturally be convinced. Groups were invited to private meetings to discuss the bill. Tours of ships and shipyards were arranged. The Kaiser and Chancellor stressed that the fleet was only intended for protection of Germany, but so that even a first class power might think twice before attacking. Highlights from a letter Prince Bismarck wrote were read out in the Reichstag, though not mentioning passages where he expressed reservations. Papers were circulated showing the relative size of foreign fleets, and how much Germany had fallen behind, particularly when considering the great power of her army compared to others.

A press bureau was created in the Navy Ministry to ensure journalists were thoroughly briefed, and to politely answer any and all objections. Pre-written articles were provided for the convenience of journalists. University professors were invited to speak on the importance of protecting German trade. The Navy League was formed to popularise the idea of world naval power and its importance to the Empire. It was argued that colonies overseas were essential, and Germany deserved her &quot;place in the sun&quot;. League membership grew from 78,000 in 1898, to 600,000 in 1901 and 1.1 million by 1914. Special attention was given to members of the budget committee who would consider the bill in detail. Their interests and connections were analysed to find ways to influence them. Steel magnate Fritz Krupp and shipowner Albert Ballin of the Hamburg-America Line were invited to speak on the benefits of the bill to trade and industry.

Objections were raised that the bill surrendered one of the most important powers of the Reichstag, that of annually scrutinising expenditure. Conservatives felt that expenditure on the navy was wasted, and that if money was available it should go to the army, which would be the deciding factor in any likely war. Eugen Richter of the Liberal Radical Union opposing the bill observed that if it was intended for Germany now to seriously take up the trident to match its other forces, then such a small force would not suffice, and there would be no end to ship building. August Bebel of the Social Democrats argued that there existed a number of deputies who were Anglophobes and wished to pick a fight with Britain, but that to imagine such a fleet could take on the Royal Navy was insanity and anyone saying it belonged in the madhouse.

Yet by the end of the debates the country was convinced that the bill would and should be passed. On 26 March 1898 it did so, by a majority of 212 to 139. All those around the Kaiser were ecstatic at their success. Tirpitz as navy minister was elevated to a seat on the Prussian Ministry of State. His influence and importance as the man who had accomplished this miracle was assured and he was to remain at the centre of government for the next nineteen years.

====Second Naval Bill====
One year after the passage of the bill Tirpitz appeared before the Reichstag and declared his satisfaction with it. The specified fleet would still be smaller than the French or British, but would be able to deter the Russians in the Baltic. Within another year all had changed. In October 1899 the Boer War broke out between the British and Boers in South Africa. In January 1900 a British cruiser intercepted three German mail steamers and searched them for war supplies intended for the Boers. Germany was outraged and the opportunity presented itself for a second Naval Bill. The second bill doubled the number of battleships from nineteen to thirty-eight. This would form four squadrons of eight ships, plus two flagships and four reserves. The bill now spanned seventeen years from 1901 to 1917 with the final ships being completed by 1920. This would constitute the second-largest fleet in the world and although no mention was made in the bill of specific enemies, it made several general mentions of a greater power which it was intended to oppose. There was only one navy which could be meant. On 5 December 1899 Tirpitz was promoted to &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (vice admiral). The bill passed on 20 June 1900.

Specifically written into the preamble was an explanation of Tirpitz&#x27;s risk theory. Although the German fleet would be smaller, it was likely that an enemy with a world spanning empire would not be able to concentrate all its forces in local waters. Even if it could, the German fleet would still be sufficiently powerful to inflict significant damage in any battle, sufficient damage that the enemy would be unable to maintain its other naval commitments and must suffer irreparable harm. Thus no such enemy would risk an engagement. Privately, Tirpitz acknowledged a second risk: that Britain might see the growing German fleet and attack before it grew to a dangerous size. A similar course had been taken before when Lord Nelson sank Danish ships at Copenhagen to prevent them falling into French hands. Tirpitz calculated this danger period would end in 1904 or 1905. In the event, Britain responded to the increased German building programme by building more ships herself and the theoretical danger period extended itself to beyond the start of the Great War. As a reward for the successful bill Tirpitz was ennobled with the hereditary article &quot;von&quot; before his name in 1900.

Tirpitz noted the difficulties in his relationship with the Kaiser. Wilhelm respected him as the only man who had succeeded in persuading the Reichstag to start and then increase a world class navy, but he remained unpredictable. He was fanatical about the navy, but would come up with wild ideas for improvements, which Tirpitz had to deflect to maintain his objectives. Each summer Tirpitz would go to St Blasien with his aides to work on naval plans, then in September he would travel to the Kaiser&#x27;s retreat at Rominten, where Tirpitz found he would be more relaxed and willing to listen to a well argued explanation.

Three supplementary naval bills (&quot;Novelles&quot;) were passed, in June 1906, April 1908 and June 1912. The first followed German diplomatic defeats over Morocco, and added six large cruisers to the fleet. The second followed fears of British encroachment, and reduced the replacement time which a ship would remain in service from 25 to 20 years. The third was caused by the Agadir Crisis where again Germany had to draw back. This time three more battleships were added.

The first naval law caused little alarm in the United Kingdom. There was already in force a dual power standard defining the size of the British fleet as at least that of the next two largest fleets combined. There was now a new player, but her fleet was similar in size to the other two possible threats, Russia and France, and a number of battleships were already under construction. The second naval law, however, caused serious alarm: eight &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class battleships were ordered in response. It was the regularity and efficiency with which Germany was now building ships, which were seen to be as good as any in the world, which raised concern. Information about the design of the new battleships suggested they were only intended to operate within a short range of a home base and not to stay at sea for extended periods. They seemed designed only for operations in the North Sea. The result was that Britain abandoned its policy of isolation which had held force since the time of Nelson and began to look for allies against the growing threat from Germany. Ships were withdrawn from around the world and brought back to British waters, while construction of new ships increased.

====Tirpitz Plan====
Tirpitz&#x27;s design to achieve world power status through naval power, while at the same time addressing domestic issues, is referred to as the Tirpitz Plan. Politically, the Tirpitz Plan was marked by the Fleet Acts of 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1912. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly 40% smaller than the Royal Navy). It included seventeen modern dreadnoughts, five battlecruisers, twenty-five cruisers and twenty pre-dreadnought battleships as well as over forty submarines. Although including fairly unrealistic targets, the expansion programme was sufficient to alarm the British, starting a costly naval arms race and pushing the British into closer ties with the French.

Tirpitz believed that the development of maritime power would advance Germany&#x27;s economic interests and so serve as a &quot;palliative against educated and uneducated Social Democrats&quot;.

Tirpitz developed a &quot;risk theory&quot; whereby, if the German Imperial Navy reached a certain level of strength relative to Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy, the British would try to avoid confrontation with Germany (that is, maintain a fleet in being). If the two navies fought, the German Navy would inflict enough damage on the British that the latter ran a risk of losing their naval dominance. Because the British relied on their navy to maintain control over the British Empire, Tirpitz felt they would opt to maintain naval supremacy in order to safeguard their empire, and let Germany become a world power, rather than lose the empire at the cost of keeping Germany less powerful. This theory sparked a naval arms race between the German and British Empires in the first decade of the 20th century.

This theory was based on the assumption that Britain would have to send its fleet into the North Sea to blockade the German ports (blockading Germany was the only way the Royal Navy could seriously harm Germany), where the German Navy could force a battle. However, due to Germany&#x27;s geographic location, Britain could blockade Germany by closing the entrance to the North Sea in the English Channel and the area between Bergen and the Shetland Islands. Faced with this option a German admiral commented, &quot;If the British do that, the role of our navy will be a sad one&quot;, correctly predicting the role the surface fleet would have during the First World War.

Politically and strategically, Tirpitz&#x27;s risk theory ensured its own failure. By its very nature it forced Britain into measures that would have been previously unacceptable to the British establishment. The necessity to concentrate the fleet against the German threat involved Britain making arrangements with other powers that enabled her to return the bulk of her naval forces to home waters. The first evidence of this is seen in the Anglo-Japanese treaty of 1902 that enabled the battleships of the China squadron to be re-allocated back to Europe. The Japanese fleet, largely constructed in British shipyards, then proceeded to utterly destroy the Russian Navy in the war of 1904–05, removing Russia as a credible maritime opponent. The necessity to reduce the Mediterranean Fleet in order to reinforce the navy in home waters was also a powerful influence in its détente and Entente Cordiale with the French. By forcing the British to come to terms with its most traditional opponent, Tirpitz scuttled his own policy. Britain was no longer at risk from France, and the Japanese destruction of the Russian fleet removed that nation as a naval threat. In the space of a few years, Germany was faced with virtually the whole strength of the Royal Navy deployed against its own fleet, and Britain committed to her list of potential enemies. The Tirpitz risk theory made it more probable that, in any future conflict between the European powers, Britain would be on the side of Germany&#x27;s foes, and that the full force of the most powerful navy in the world would be concentrated against her fleet.

Tirpitz had been made a &quot;Großadmiral&quot; (grand admiral) in 1911, without patent (the document that accompanied formal promotions personally signed at this level by the Kaiser himself). At that time, the German Imperial Navy had only four ranks for admirals: rear admiral, (&quot;Konteradmiral&quot;, equal to a &quot;Generalmajor&quot; in the army, with no pips on the shoulders); vice admiral (&quot;Vizeadmiral&quot;, equal to a &quot;Generalleutnant&quot;, with one pip); admiral (equal to a &quot;General der Infanterie&quot;, with two pips), and grand admiral (equal to a field marshal). Tirpitz&#x27;s shoulder boards had four pips, but he never received a grand admiral&#x27;s baton or the associated insignia.

====World War I====

Despite the building programme he oversaw, he believed that the war had come too soon for a successful surface challenge to the Royal Navy, as the Fleet Act of 1900 had included a seventeen-year timetable. Unable to direct naval operations from his purely administrative position, Tirpitz became a vocal spokesman for unrestricted U-boat warfare, which he felt could strangle Britain&#x27;s supply of food and force them to terms. While the German Navy abandoned the observance of cruiser rules in 1915, this policy was reversed following the outcry over the &quot;Lusitania&quot; sinking. Tirpitz, a popular figure (&quot;on account of his aggressiveness and his beard&quot;, according to US ambassador Gerard), had agitated against all restrictions using the German press, and threats to resign, and began to fall out with the Kaiser as a result. When the restrictions on the submarine war were not lifted, he finally resigned on 15 March 1916. He was replaced as State Secretary of the Imperial Naval Office by Eduard von Capelle.

Despite his support for unrestricted U-boat warfare, Tirpitz placed a low priority on submarine construction during his leadership of the Imperial Naval Office. Ultimately, this decision would result in a severe shortage of newly built U-boats by 1917.

==Fatherland Party==

In September 1917 Grand Admiral Tirpitz became a co-founder of the Pan-Germanic and nationalist Fatherland Party (&quot;Deutsche Vaterlandspartei&quot;). The party was organised jointly by Heinrich Claß, Konrad Freiherr von Wangenheim, Tirpitz as chairman and Wolfgang Kapp as his deputy. The party attracted the opponents of a negotiated peace; it organised opposition to the parliamentary majority in the Reichstag, which was seeking peace negotiations. It sought to bring together outside parliament all parties on the political right, which had not previously been done. At its peak, in the summer of 1918, the party had around 1,250,000 members. It proposed both &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff as &quot;people&#x27;s emperors&quot; of a military state whose legitimacy was based on war and on war aims instead of on the parliamentary government of the &quot;Reich&quot;. Internally, there were calls for a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; against the German government, to be led by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, even against the Kaiser if necessary. Tirpitz&#x27;s experience with the Navy League and with mass political agitation convinced him that the means for a coup was at hand.

Tirpitz considered that one of the main aims of the war must be annexation of new territory in the west, to allow Germany to develop into a world power. This meant holding the Belgian ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend, with an eye to the main enemy, the United Kingdom. He proposed a separate peace treaty with Russia, giving them access to the ocean. Germany would be a great continental state but could maintain its world position only by expanding world trade and continuing the fight against the UK. He complained of indecision and ambiguity in German policy, humanitarian ideas of self-preservation, a policy of appeasement of neutrals at the expense of vital German interests, and begging for peace. He called for vigorous warfare without regard for diplomatic and commercial consequences and supported the most extreme use of weapons, especially unrestricted submarine warfare.

The Fatherland Party had ceased its operations by February 1919.

From 1908 to 1918 Tirpitz served as a member of the Prussian House of Lords.

== After 1918 ==
After Germany&#x27;s defeat Tirpitz supported the right-wing German National People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Deutschnationale Volkspartei&quot;, or &quot;DNVP&quot;) and sat for it in the Reichstag from 1924 until 1928.

Tirpitz died in Ebenhausen, near Munich, on 6 March 1930. He is buried in the Waldfriedhof in Munich.

<text>The Adams–Onís Treaty () of 1819, also known as the Transcontinental Treaty, the Spanish Cession, the Florida Purchase Treaty, or the Florida Treaty, was a treaty between the United States and Spain in 1819 that ceded Florida to the U.S. and defined the boundary between the U.S. and Mexico (New Spain). It settled a standing border dispute between the two countries and was considered a triumph of American diplomacy. It came during the successful Spanish American wars of independence against Spain.

Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or staff garrisons, so Madrid decided to cede the territory to the United States in exchange for settling the boundary dispute along the Sabine River in Spanish Texas. The treaty established the boundary of U.S. territory and claims through the Rocky Mountains and west to the Pacific Ocean, in exchange for Washington paying residents&#x27; claims against the Spanish government up to a total of $5 million Spanish dollars (purchasing power ) and relinquishing the U.S. claims on parts of Spanish Texas west of the Sabine River and other Spanish areas, under the terms of the Louisiana Purchase.

The treaty remained in full effect for only 183 days: from February 22, 1821, to August 24, 1821, when Spanish military officials signed the Treaty of Córdoba acknowledging the independence of Mexico; Spain repudiated that treaty, but Mexico effectively took control of Spain&#x27;s former colony. The Treaty of Limits between Mexico and the United States, signed in 1828 and effective in 1832, recognized the border defined by the Adams–Onís Treaty as the boundary between the two nations.

==History==
 
The Adams–Onís Treaty was negotiated by John Quincy Adams, the Secretary of State under U.S. President James Monroe, and the Spanish minister plenipotentiary (diplomatic envoy) Luis de Onís y González-Vara, during the reign of King Ferdinand VII.

===Florida===
Spain had long rejected repeated American efforts to purchase Florida. But by 1818, Spain was facing a troubling colonial situation in which the cession of Florida made sense. Spain had been exhausted by the Peninsular War (1807–1814) against Napoleon in Europe and needed to rebuild its credibility and presence in its colonies. Revolutionaries in Central America and South America had been waging wars of independence since 1810. Spain was unwilling to invest further in Florida, encroached on by American settlers, and it worried about the border between New Spain (a large area including today&#x27;s Mexico, Central America, and much of the current U.S. western states) and the United States. With minor military presence in Florida, Spain was not able to restrain the Seminole warriors who routinely crossed the border and raided American villages and farms, as well as protected southern slave refugees from slave owners and traders of the southern United States.

The United States from 1810 to 1813 annexed and then invaded most of West Florida (already independent as the Republic of West Florida west of the Pearl River) up to the Perdido River (modern border river between the states of Alabama and Florida), claiming that the Louisiana Purchase covered West Florida also. General James Wilkinson invaded and occupied Mobile during the War of 1812 and the Spanish never returned to West Florida west of the Perdido River.

The State of Muskogee (1799–1803) demonstrated Spain&#x27;s inability to control the interior of East Florida, at least &quot;de facto&quot;; the Spanish presence had been reduced to the capital (San Agustín) and other coastal cities, while the interior belonged to the Seminole nation.

While fighting escaped African-American slaves, outlaws, and Native Americans in U.S.-controlled Georgia during the First Seminole War, American General Andrew Jackson had pursued them into Spanish Florida. He built Fort Scott, at the southern border of Georgia (i.e., the U.S.), and used it to destroy the Negro Fort in northwest Florida, whose existence was perceived as an intolerably disruptive risk by Georgia plantation owners.

To stop the Seminole based in East Florida from raiding Georgia settlements and offering havens for runaway slaves, the U.S. Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory. This included the 1817–1818 campaign by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War, after which the U.S. effectively seized control of Florida; albeit for purposes of lawful government and administration in Georgia and not for the outright annexation of territory for the U.S. Adams said the U.S. had to take control because Florida (along the border of Georgia and Alabama Territory) had become &quot;a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them&quot;. Spain asked for British intervention, but London declined to assist Spain in the negotiations. Some of President Monroe&#x27;s cabinet demanded Jackson&#x27;s immediate dismissal for invading Florida, but Adams realized that his success had given the U.S. a favorable diplomatic position. Adams was able to negotiate very favorable terms.

===Louisiana===
In 1521, the Spanish Empire created the &quot;Virreinato de Nueva España&quot; (Viceroyalty of New Spain) to govern its conquests in the Caribbean, North America, and later the Pacific Ocean. In 1682, La Salle claimed Louisiana for France. For the Spanish Empire, this was an intrusion into the northeastern frontier of New Spain. In 1691, Spain created the Province of Tejas in an attempt to inhibit French settlement west of the Mississippi River. Fearing the loss of his American territories in the Seven Years&#x27; War, King Louis XV of France ceded Louisiana to King Charles III of Spain with the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762. The Treaty of Paris of 1763 split Louisiana with the portion east of the Mississippi River (except for Île d&#x27;Orléans) becoming a part of British North America and the portion west of the river becoming the District of Louisiana within New Spain. This eliminated the French threat, and the Spanish provinces of Luisiana, Tejas, and Santa Fe de Nuevo México coexisted with only loosely defined borders. In 1800, French First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte forced King Charles IV of Spain to cede Louisiana to France with the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. Spain continued to administer Louisiana until 1802 when Spain publicly transferred the district to France. The following year, Napoleon sold the territory to the United States to raise money for his military campaigns.

The United States and the Spanish Empire disagreed over the territorial boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. The United States maintained the claim of France that Louisiana included the Mississippi River and &quot;all lands whose waters flow to it&quot;. To the west of New Orleans, the United States assumed the French claim to all land east and north of either the Sabine River or the Rio Grande. Spain maintained that all land west of the Calcasieu River and south of the Arkansas River belonged to Tejas and Santa Fe de Nuevo México.

===Oregon Country===

The British government claimed the region west of the Continental Divide between the undefined borders of Alta California and Russian Alaska on the basis of (1) the third voyage of James Cook in 1778, (2) the Vancouver Expedition in 1791–1795, (3) the solo journey of Alexander Mackenzie to the North Bentinck Arm in 1792–1793, and (4) the exploration of David Thompson in 1807–1812. The Third Nootka Convention of 1794 stipulated that both the British and Spanish would abandon any settlements they had in the Nootka Sound.

The United States claimed essentially the same region on the basis of (1) the voyage of Robert Gray up the Columbia River in 1792, (2) the United States Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–1806, and (3) the establishment of Fort Astoria on the Columbia River in 1811. On 20 October 1818, the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 was signed setting the border between British North America and the United States east of the Continental Divide along the 49th parallel north and calling for joint Anglo-American occupancy west of the Great Divide. The Anglo-American Convention ignored the Nootka Convention of 1794 which gave Spain joint rights in the region. The convention also ignored Russian settlements in the region. The U.S. government referred to this region as the Oregon Country, while the British government referred to the region as the Columbia District.

===Russian America===
On 16 July 1741, the crew of the Imperial Russian Navy ship &quot;Saint Peter&quot; (&quot;Святой Пётр&quot;), captained by Vitus Bering, sighted Mount Saint Elias, the fourth-highest summit in North America. While dispatched on the Russian Great Northern Expedition, they became the first Europeans to land in northwestern North America. The Russian fur trade soon followed the discovery. By 1812, the Russian Empire claimed Alaska and the Pacific Coast of North America as far south as the Russian settlement of Fortress Ross, only northwest of the Spain&#x27;s Presidio Real de San Francisco.

===New Spain===

The Spanish Empire claimed all lands west of the Continental Divide throughout the Americas. Between 1774 and 1779, King Charles III of Spain ordered three naval expeditions north along the Pacific Coast to assert Spain&#x27;s territorial claims. In July 1774, Juan José Pérez Hernández reached latitude 54°40′ north off the northwestern tip of Langara Island before being forced to turn south. On 15 August 1775, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra reached the latitude 59°0′ before returning south. On 23 July 1779, Ignacio de Arteaga y Bazán and Bodega y Quadra reached Puerto de Santiago on Isla de la Magdalena (now Port Etches on Hinchinbrook Island) where they held a formal possession ceremony commemorating Saint James, the patron saint of Spain. This marked the northernmost Spanish exploration in the Pacific Ocean.

Between 1788 and 1793, Spain launched several more expeditions north of Alta California. On 24 June 1789, Esteban José Martínez Fernández y Martínez de la Sierra established the Spanish colony of Santa Cruz de Nuca on the northwest coast of Vancouver Island. Asserting Spain&#x27;s claim of exclusive sovereignty and navigation rights, Martínez seized several ships in Nootka Sound provoking the Nootka Crisis with Great Britain. In negotiations to resolve the crisis, Spain claimed that its Nootka Territory extended north from Alta California to the 61st parallel north and from the Continental Divide west to the 147th meridian west. On 11 January 1794, the Spanish and British governments signed the Third Nootka Convention which called for the abandonment of all permanent settlements on Nootka Sound. Santa Cruz de Nuca was formally abandoned on 28 March 1795. The convention also stipulated that both nations were free to use Nootka Sound as a port and erect temporary structures, but, &quot;neither ... shall form any permanent establishment in the said port or claim any right of sovereignty or territorial dominion there to the exclusion of the other. And Their said Majesties will mutually aid each other to maintain for their subjects free access to the port of Nootka against any other nation which may attempt to establish there any sovereignty or dominion&quot;. On 19 August 1796, Spain made the decision to join the French Republic in their war against Great Britain with the signing of the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, thus ending Spanish and British cooperation in the Americas.

East of the Continental Divide, the Spanish Empire claimed all land south of the Arkansas River that was west of the Calcasieu River. The vast disputed region between the territorial claims of the United States and Spain was occupied primarily by native peoples with very few traders of either Spain or the United States present. In the south, the disputed region between the Calcasieu River and the Sabine River encompassed Los Adaes, the first capital of Spanish Texas. The region between the Calcasieu and Sabine rivers became a lawless no man&#x27;s land. The United States saw great potential in these western lands, and hoped to settle their borders. Spain, seeing the end of New Spain, hoped to employ its territorial claims before it would be forced to grant Mexico its independence (later in 1821). Spain hoped to regain much of its territory after the regional demands for independence subsided.

===Details of the treaty===

The treaty, consisting of 16 articles was signed in Adams&#x27; State Department office at Washington, on February 22, 1819, by John Quincy Adams, U.S. Secretary of State, and Luis de Onís, Spanish minister. Ratification was postponed for two years, because Spain wanted to use the treaty as an incentive to keep the United States from giving diplomatic support to the revolutionaries in South America. On February 24, the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty unanimously, but because of Spain&#x27;s stalling, a new ratification was necessary and this time there were objections. Henry Clay and other Western spokesmen demanded that Spain also give up Texas. This proposal was defeated by the Senate, which ratified the treaty a second time on February 19, 1821, following ratification by Spain on October 24, 1820. Ratifications were exchanged three days later and the treaty was proclaimed on February 22, 1821, two years after the signing.

The Treaty closed the first era of United States expansion by providing for the cession of East Florida under Article 2; the abandonment of the controversy over West Florida under Article 2 (a portion of which had been seized by the United States); and the definition of a boundary with New Spain, that clearly made Texas a part of it, under Article 3, thus ending much of the vagueness in the boundary of the Louisiana Purchase. Spain also ceded to the U.S. its claims to the Oregon Country, under Article 3.

The U.S. did not pay Spain for Florida, but instead agreed to pay the legal claims of American citizens against Spain, to a maximum of $5 million, under Article 11. Under Article 12, Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty of 1795 between the U.S. and Spain was to remain in force. Under Article 15, Spanish goods received exclusive most-favored-nation privileges in the ports at Pensacola and St. Augustine for twelve years.

Under Article 2, the U.S. received ownership of Spanish Florida. Under Article 3, the U.S. relinquished its own claims on parts of Texas west of the Sabine River and other Spanish areas.

==Border==

Article 3 of the treaty states:
The Boundary Line between the two Countries, West of the Mississippi, shall begin on the Gulf of Mexico, at the mouth of the River Sabine in the Sea (), continuing North, along the Western Bank of that River, to the 32d degree of Latitude (); thence by a Line due North to the degree of Latitude, where it strikes the Rio Roxo of Nachitoches, or Red-River (), then following the course of the Rio-Roxo Westward to the degree of Longitude, 100 West from London and 23 from Washington (), then crossing the said Red-River, and running thence by a Line due North to the River Arkansas (), thence, following the Course of the Southern bank of the Arkansas to its source in Latitude, 42. North and thence by that parallel of Latitude to the South-Sea [Pacific Ocean]. The whole being as laid down in Melishe&#x27;s Map of the United States, published at Philadelphia, improved to the first of January 1818. But if the Source of the Arkansas River shall be found to fall North or South of Latitude 42, then the Line shall run from the said Source () due South or North, as the case may be, till it meets the said Parallel of Latitude 42 (), and thence along the said Parallel to the South Sea ().
At the time the treaty was signed, the course of the Sabine River, Red River, and Arkansas River had only been partially charted. Furthermore, the rivers changed course periodically. It would take many years before the location of the border would be fully determined.

South of the 32nd parallel north, the Spanish Empire and the United States settled for the U.S. claim along the Sabine River. Between the meridians 94°2′45&quot; and 100° west, the parties settled on the Spanish claim along the Red River. West of the 100th meridian west, the parties settled on the Spanish claim along the Arkansas River. From the source of the Arkansas River in the Rocky Mountains, the parties settled on a border due north along that meridian (106°20′37″W) to the 42nd parallel north, thence west along the 42nd parallel to the Pacific Ocean.

Spain won substantial buffer zones around its provinces of Tejas, Santa Fe de Nuevo México, and Alta California in New Spain. While the United States relinquished substantial territory east of Continental Divide, the newly defined border allowed settlement of the southwestern part of the State of Louisiana, the Arkansas Territory, and the Missouri Territory.

Spain relinquished all claims in the Americas north of the 42nd parallel north. This was a historic retreat in its 327-year pursuit of lands in the Americas. The previous Anglo-American Convention of 1818 meant that both American and British citizens could settle land north of the 42nd parallel and west of the Continental Divide. The United States now had a firm foothold on the Pacific Coast and could commence settlement of the jointly occupied Oregon Country (known as the Columbia District to the British government). The Russian Empire also claimed this entire region as part of Russian America.

For the United States, this Treaty (and the Treaty of 1818 with Britain agreeing to joint control of the Pacific Northwest) meant that its claimed territory now extended far west from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean. For Spain, it meant that it kept its colony of Texas and also kept a buffer zone between its colonies in California and New Mexico and the U.S. territories. Many historians consider the Treaty to be a great achievement for the U.S., as time validated Adams&#x27;s vision that it would allow the U.S. to open trade with the Orient across the Pacific.

Informally this new border has been called the &quot;Step Boundary&quot;, although the step-like shape of the boundary was not apparent for several decades—the source of the Arkansas, believed to be near the 42nd parallel north, was not known until John C. Frémont located it in the 1840s, hundreds of miles south of the 42nd parallel.

==Implementation==
Washington set up a commission, 1821 to 1824, that handled American claims against Spain. Many notable lawyers, including Daniel Webster and William Wirt, represented claimants before the commission. Dr. Tobias Watkins served as secretary. During its term, the commission examined 1,859 claims arising from over 720 spoliation incidents, and distributed the $5 million in a basically fair manner.
The treaty reduced tensions with Spain (and after 1821 Mexico), and allowed budget cutters in Congress to reduce the army budget and reject the plans to modernize and expand the army proposed by Secretary of War John C. Calhoun. The treaty was honored by both sides, although inaccurate maps from the treaty meant that the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma remained unclear for most of the 19th century.

==Later developments==

The treaty was ratified by Spain in 1820, and by the United States in 1821 (during the time that Spain and Mexico were engaged in the prolonged Mexican War of Independence). Luis de Onís published a 152-page memoir on the diplomatic negotiation in 1820, which was translated from Spanish to English by US diplomatic commission secretary, Tobias Watkins in 1821.

Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the Treaty of Córdoba signed on August 24, 1821. While Mexico was not initially a party to the Adams–Onís Treaty, in 1831 Mexico ratified the treaty by agreeing to the 1828 Treaty of Limits with the U.S.

With the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, the Russian Empire ceded its claims south of parallel 54°40′ north to the United States. With the Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1825, Russia set the southern border of Alaska on the same parallel in exchange for the Russian right to trade south of that border and the British right to navigate north of that border. This set the absolute limits of the Oregon Country/Columbia District between the 42nd parallel north and the parallel 54°40′ north west of the Continental Divide.

By the mid-1830s, a controversy developed regarding the border with Texas, during which the United States demonstrated that the Sabine and Neches rivers had been switched on maps, moving the frontier in favor of Mexico. As a consequence, the eastern boundary of Texas was not firmly established until the independence of the Republic of Texas in 1836. It was not agreed upon by the United States and Mexico until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which concluded the Mexican–American War. That treaty also formalized the cession by Mexico of Alta California and today&#x27;s American Southwest, except for the territory of the later Gadsden Purchase of 1854.

Another dispute occurred after Texas joined the Union. The treaty stated that the boundary between the French claims on the north and the Spanish claims on the south was Rio Roxo de Natchitoches (Red River) until it reached the 100th meridian, as noted on the John Melish map of 1818. But, the 100th meridian on the Melish map was marked some east of the true 100th meridian, and the Red River forked about east of the 100th meridian. Texas claimed the land south of the North Fork, and the United States claimed the land north of the South Fork (later called the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River). In 1860, Texas organized the area as Greer County. The matter was not settled until a in 1896 upheld federal claims to the territory, after which it was added to the Oklahoma Territory.

The treaty gave rise to a later border dispute between the states of Oregon and California, which remains unresolved. Upon statehood in 1850, California established the 42nd parallel as its constitutional de jure border as it had existed since 1819 when the territory was part of Spanish Mexico. In an 1868–1870 border survey following the admission of Oregon as a state, errors were made in demarcating and marking the Oregon-California border, creating a dispute that continues to this day.

In 2020, a hoax appeared in Spain according to which, in 2055, the Adams–Onís Treaty would expire and Florida would be returned to Spain by the United States, which is false.

<text>An interview is a structured conversation where one participant asks questions, and the other provides answers. In common parlance, the word &quot;interview&quot; refers to a one-on-one conversation between an &quot;interviewer&quot; and an &quot;interviewee&quot;. The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds, usually providing information. That information may be used or provided to other audiences immediately or later. This feature is common to many types of interviews – a job interview or interview with a witness to an event may have no other audience present at the time, but the answers will be later provided to others in the employment or investigative process. An interview may also transfer information in both directions.

Interviews usually take place face-to-face, in person, but the parties may instead be separated geographically, as in videoconferencing or telephone interviews. Interviews almost always involve a spoken conversation between two or more parties, but can also happen between two persons who type their questions and answers.

Interviews can be unstructured, free-wheeling, and open-ended conversations without a predetermined plan or prearranged questions. One form of unstructured interview is a focused interview in which the interviewer consciously and consistently guides the conversation so that the interviewee&#x27;s responses do not stray from the main research topic or idea. Interviews can also be highly structured conversations in which specific questions occur in a specified order. They can follow diverse formats; for example, in a ladder interview, a respondent&#x27;s answers typically guide subsequent interviews, with the object being to explore a respondent&#x27;s subconscious motives. Typically the interviewer has some way of recording the information that is gleaned from the interviewee, often by keeping notes with a pencil and paper, or with a video or audio recorder.

The traditionally two-person interview format, sometimes called a one-on-one interview, permits direct questions and follow-ups, which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy and relevance of responses. It is a flexible arrangement in the sense that subsequent questions can be tailored to clarify earlier answers. Further, it eliminates possible distortion due to other parties being present. Interviews have taken on an even more significant role, offering opportunities to showcase not just expertise, but adaptability and strategic thinking.

== Contexts ==

Interviews can happen in a wide variety of contexts:
* Employment. A job interview is a formal consultation for evaluating the qualifications of the interviewee for a specific position. One type of job interview is a case interview in which the applicant is presented with a question or task or challenge, and asked to resolve the situation. Candidates may be treated to a mock interview as a training exercise to prepare the respondent to handle questions in the subsequent &#x27;real&#x27; interview. A series of interviews may be arranged, with the first interview sometimes being a short &quot;screening interview&quot;, followed by more in-depth interviews, usually by company personnel who can ultimately hire the applicant. Technology has enabled new possibilities for interviewing; for example, video telephony has enabled interviewing applicants from afar which is becoming increasingly popular.
* Psychology. Psychologists use a variety of interviewing methods and techniques to try to understand and help their patients. In a psychiatric interview, a psychiatrist or psychologist or nurse asks a battery of questions to complete what is called a psychiatric assessment. Sometimes two people are interviewed by an interviewer, with one format being called couple interviews. Criminologists and detectives sometimes use cognitive interviews on eyewitnesses and victims to try to ascertain what can be recalled specifically from a crime scene, hopefully before the specific memories begin to fade in the mind.
* Marketing and Academic. In marketing research and academic research, interviews are used in a wide variety of ways as a method to do extensive personality tests. Interviews are the most used form of data collection in qualitative research. Interviews are used in marketing research as a tool that a firm may utilize to gain an understanding of how consumers think, or as a tool in the form of cognitive interviewing (or cognitive pretesting) for improving questionnaire design. Consumer research firms sometimes use computer-assisted telephone interviewing to randomly dial phone numbers to conduct highly structured telephone interviews, with scripted questions and responses entered directly into the computer.
* Journalism and other media. Typically, reporters covering a story in journalism conduct interviews over the phone and in person to gain information for subsequent publication. Reporters also interview government officials and political candidates for broadcast. In a talk show, a radio or television host interviews one or more people, with the topic usually chosen by the host, sometimes for entertainment, sometimes for informational purposes. Such interviews are often recorded.
* Other situations. Sometimes college representatives or alumni conduct college interviews with prospective students as a way of assessing a student&#x27;s suitability while offering the student a chance to learn more about a college. Some services specialize in coaching people for interviews. Embassy officials may conduct interviews with applicants for student visas before approving their visa applications. Interviewing in legal contexts is often called interrogation. Debriefing is another kind of interview.

== Interviewer bias ==

The relationship between the interviewer and interviewee in research settings can have both positive and negative consequences. Their relationship can bring deeper understanding of the information being collected, however this creates a risk that the interviewer will be unable to be unbiased in their collection and interpretation of information. Bias or discrimination can be created from the interviewer&#x27;s perception of the interviewee, or the interviewee&#x27;s perception of the interviewer. Additionally, a researcher can bring biases to the table based on the researcher&#x27;s mental state, their preparedness for conducting the research, and the researcher conducting inappropriate interviews. Interviewers can use various practices known in qualitative research to mitigate interviewer bias. These practices include subjectivity, objectivity, and reflexivity. Each of these practices allows the interviewer, or researcher, the opportunity to use their bias to enhance their work by gaining a deeper understanding of the problem they are studying.

==Blind interview==
In a blind interview the identity of the interviewee is concealed to reduce interviewer bias. Blind interviews are sometimes used in the software industry and are standard in blind auditions. Blind interviews have been shown in some cases to increase the hiring of minorities and women.

<text>Amniotes are tetrapod vertebrate animals belonging to the clade Amniota, a large group that comprises the vast majority of living terrestrial and semiaquatic vertebrates. Amniotes evolved from amphibious stem tetrapod ancestors during the Carboniferous period. Amniota is defined as the smallest crown clade containing humans, the Greek tortoise, and the Nile crocodile. 

Amniotes are distinguished from the other living tetrapod clade — the non-amniote lissamphibians (frogs/toads, salamanders/newts and caecilians) — by the development of three extraembryonic membranes (amnion for embryonic protection, chorion for gas exchange, and allantois for metabolic waste disposal or storage), thicker and keratinized skin, costal respiration (breathing by expanding/constricting the rib cage), the presence of adrenocortical and chromaffin tissues as a discrete pair of glands near their kidneys, more complex kidneys, the presence of an astragalus for better extremity range of motion, the diminished role of skin breathing, and the complete loss of metamorphosis, gills, and lateral lines. 

The presence of an amniotic buffer, of a water-impermeable skin, and of a robust, air-breathing, respiratory system, allow amniotes to live on land as true terrestrial animals. Amniotes have the ability to procreate without water bodies. Because the amnion and the fluid it secretes shields the embryo from environmental fluctuations, amniotes can reproduce on dry land by either laying shelled eggs (reptiles, birds and monotremes) or nurturing fertilized eggs within the mother (marsupial and placental mammals). This distinguishes amniotes from anamniotes (fish and amphibians) that have to spawn in aquatic environments. Most amniotes still require regular access to drinking water for rehydration, like the semiaquatic amphibians do. 

They have better homeostasis in drier environments, and more efficient non-aquatic gas exchange to power terrestrial locomotion, which is facilitated by their astragalus.

Basal amniotes resembled small lizards and evolved from semiaquatic reptiliomorphs during the Carboniferous period. After the Carboniferous rainforest collapse, amniotes spread around Earth&#x27;s land and became the dominant land vertebrates.

They almost immediately diverged into two groups, namely the sauropsids (including all reptiles and birds) and synapsids (including mammals and extinct ancestors like &quot;pelycosaurs&quot; and therapsids). Among the earliest known crown group amniotes, the oldest known sauropsid is &quot;Hylonomus&quot; and the oldest known synapsid is &quot;Asaphestera&quot;, both of which are from Nova Scotia during the Bashkirian age of the Late Carboniferous around . 

This basal divergence within Amniota has also been dated by molecular studies at 310–329 Ma, or 312–330 Ma, and by a fossilized birth–death process study at 322–340 Ma.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;amniote&quot; comes from the amnion, which derives from Greek ἀμνίον (&quot;amnion&quot;), which denoted the membrane that surrounds a fetus. The term originally described a bowl in which the blood of sacrificed animals was caught, and derived from ἀμνός (&quot;amnos&quot;), meaning &quot;lamb&quot;.

==Description==

Zoologists characterize amniotes in part by embryonic development that includes the formation of several extensive membranes, the amnion, chorion, and allantois. Amniotes develop directly into a (typically) terrestrial form with limbs and a thick stratified epithelium (rather than first entering a feeding larval tadpole stage followed by metamorphosis, as amphibians do). In amniotes, the transition from a two-layered periderm to a cornified epithelium is triggered by thyroid hormone during embryonic development, rather than by metamorphosis. The unique embryonic features of amniotes may reflect specializations for eggs to survive drier environments; or the increase in size and yolk content of eggs may have permitted, and coevolved with, direct development of the embryo to a large size.

===Adaptation for terrestrial living===
Features of amniotes evolved for survival on land include a sturdy but porous leathery or hard eggshell and an allantois that facilitates respiration while providing a reservoir for disposal of wastes. Their kidneys (metanephros) and large intestines are also well-suited to water retention. Most mammals do not lay eggs, but corresponding structures develop inside the placenta.

The ancestors of true amniotes, such as &quot;Casineria kiddi&quot;, which lived about 340 million years ago, evolved from amphibian reptiliomorphs and resembled small lizards. At the late Devonian mass extinction (360 million years ago), all known tetrapods were essentially aquatic and fish-like. Because the reptiliomorphs were already established 20 million years later when all their fishlike relatives were extinct, it appears they separated from the other tetrapods somewhere during Romer&#x27;s gap, when the adult tetrapods became fully terrestrial (some forms would later become secondarily aquatic). The modest-sized ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places, such as depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the Carboniferous swamps and forests; and dry conditions probably do not account for the emergence of the soft shell. Indeed, many modern-day amniotes require moisture to keep their eggs from desiccating. Although some modern amphibians lay eggs on land, all amphibians lack advanced traits like an amnion.

The amniotic egg formed through a series of evolutionary steps. After internal fertilization and the habit of laying eggs in terrestrial environments became a reproduction strategy amongst the amniote ancestors, the next major breakthrough appears to have involved a gradual replacement of the gelatinous coating covering the amphibian egg with a fibrous shell membrane. This allowed the egg to increase both its size and in the rate of gas exchange, permitting a larger, metabolically more active embryo to reach full development before hatching. Further developments, like extraembryonic membranes (amnion, chorion, and allantois) and a calcified shell, were not essential and probably evolved later. It has been suggested that shelled terrestrial eggs without extraembryonic membranes could still not have been more than about 1 cm (0.4-inch) in diameter because of diffusion problems, like the inability to get rid of carbon dioxide if the egg was larger. The combination of small eggs and the absence of a larval stage, where posthatching growth occurs in anamniotic tetrapods before turning into juveniles, would limit the size of the adults. This is supported by the fact that extant squamate species that lay eggs less than 1 cm in diameter have adults whose snout-vent length is less than 10 cm. The only way for the eggs to increase in size would be to develop new internal structures specialized for respiration and for waste products. As this happened, it would also affect how much the juveniles could grow before they reached adulthood.

A similar pattern can be seen in modern amphibians. Frogs that have evolved terrestrial reproduction and direct development have both smaller adults and fewer and larger eggs compared to their relatives that still reproduce in water.

===The egg membranes===
Fish and amphibian eggs have only one inner membrane, the embryonic membrane. Evolution of the amniote egg required increased exchange of gases and wastes between the embryo and the atmosphere. Structures to permit these traits allowed further adaption that increased the feasible size of amniote eggs and enabled breeding in progressively drier habitats. The increased size of eggs permitted increase in size of offspring and consequently of adults. Further growth for the latter, however, was limited by their position in the terrestrial food-chain, which was restricted to level three and below, with only invertebrates occupying level two. Amniotes would eventually experience adaptive radiations when some species evolved the ability to digest plants and new ecological niches opened up, permitting larger body-size for herbivores, omnivores and predators.

===Amniote traits===
While the early amniotes resembled their amphibian ancestors in many respects, a key difference was the lack of an otic notch at the back margin of the skull roof. In their ancestors, this notch held a spiracle, an unnecessary structure in an animal without an aquatic larval stage. There are three main lines of amniotes, which may be distinguished by the structure of the skull and in particular the number of holes behind each eye. In anapsids, the ancestral condition, there are none; in synapsids (mammals and their extinct relatives) there is one; and in diapsids (including birds, crocodilians, squamates, and tuataras), there are two. Turtles have secondarily lost their fenestrae, and were traditionally classified as anapsids because of this. Molecular testing firmly places them in the diapsid line of descent.

Post-cranial remains of amniotes can be identified from their Labyrinthodont ancestors by their having at least two pairs of sacral ribs, a sternum in the pectoral girdle (some amniotes have lost it) and an astragalus bone in the ankle.

==Definition and classification==
Amniota was first formally described by the embryologist Ernst Haeckel in 1866 on the presence of the amnion, hence the name. A problem with this definition is that the trait (apomorphy) in question does not fossilize, and the status of fossil forms has to be inferred from other traits.

===Traditional classification===
Older classifications of the amniotes traditionally recognised three classes based on major traits and physiology:

* Class Reptilia (reptiles)
** Subclass Anapsida (&quot;proto-reptiles&quot;, possibly including turtles)
** Subclass Diapsida (majority of reptiles, progenitors of birds)
** Subclass Euryapsida (plesiosaurs, placodonts, and ichthyosaurs)
** Subclass Synapsida (stem or proto-mammals, progenitors of mammals)
* Class Aves (birds)
** Subclass Archaeornithes (reptile-like birds, progenitors of all other birds)
** Subclass Enantiornithes (early birds with an alternative shoulder joint)
** Subclass Hesperornithes (toothed aquatic flightless birds)
** Subclass Ichthyornithes (toothed, but otherwise modern birds)
** Subclass Neornithes (all living birds)
* Class Mammalia (mammals)
** Subclass Prototheria (Monotremata, egg-laying mammals)
** Subclass Theria (metatheria (such as marsupials) and eutheria (such as placental mammals))

This rather orderly scheme is the one most commonly found in popular and basic scientific works. It has come under critique from cladistics, as the class Reptilia is paraphyletic—it has given rise to two other classes not included in Reptilia.

Most species described as microsaurs, formerly grouped in the extinct and prehistoric amphibian group lepospondyls, has been placed in the newer clade Recumbirostra, and shares many anatomical features with amniotes which indicates they were amniotes themselves.

===Classification into monophyletic taxa===
A different approach is adopted by writers who reject paraphyletic groupings. One such classification, by Michael Benton, is presented in simplified form below.

===Phylogenetic classification===

With the advent of cladistics, other researchers have attempted to establish new classes, based on phylogeny, but disregarding the physiological and anatomical unity of the groups. Unlike Benton, for example, Jacques Gauthier and colleagues forwarded a definition of Amniota in 1988 as &quot;the most recent common ancestor of extant mammals and reptiles, and all its descendants&quot;. As Gauthier makes use of a crown group definition, Amniota has a slightly different content than the biological amniotes as defined by an apomorphy. Though traditionally considered reptiliomorphs, some recent research has recovered diadectomorphs as the sister group to Synapsida within Amniota, based on inner ear anatomy.

===Cladogram===
The cladogram presented here illustrates the phylogeny (family tree) of amniotes, and follows a simplified version of the relationships found by Laurin &amp; Reisz (1995), with the exception of turtles, which more recent morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies placed firmly within diapsids. The cladogram covers the group as defined under Gauthier&#x27;s definition.
Following studies in 2022 and 2023, with Drepanosauromorpha placed sister to Weigeltisauridae (&quot;Coelurosauravus&quot;) in Avicephala based on Senter (2004):

<text>Timocharis of Alexandria ( or Τιμοχάρης, &quot;gen.&quot; Τιμοχάρους; c. 320–260 BC) was a Greek astronomer and philosopher. Likely born in Alexandria, he was a contemporary of Euclid.

==Work==
What little is known about Timocharis comes from citations by Ptolemy in the &quot;Almagest&quot;. These indicate that Timocharis worked in Alexandria during the 290s and 280s BC. Ptolemy lists the declination of 18 stars as recorded by Timocharis or Aristillus in roughly the year 290 BC. Between 295 and 272 BC, Timocharis recorded four lunar occultations and the passage of the planet Venus across a star. These were recorded using both the Egyptian and Athenian calendars. The observed stellar passage by Venus may have occurred on October 12, 272 BC when the planet came within 15 arcminutes of the star η Virginis.

The observations by Timocharis are among the oldest Greek records that can be assigned a specific date. They are only exceeded by records of the summer solstice of 432 BC, as noted by Euctemon and Meton. Timocharis worked with Aristillus in an astronomical observatory that was most likely part of the Library of Alexandria. Their equipment would have been simple, most likely consisting of gnomons, sundials and an armillary sphere. The two were contemporaries of Aristarchus of Samos, but it is unclear whether there was any association between Timocharis and Aristarchus.

During his astronomical observations, Timocharis recorded that the star Spica was located 8° west of the Autumnal equinox. Later, Hipparchus observed that Spica was only 6° west of the Autumnal equinox. Hipparchus was able to deduce the period during which Timocharis made his observations based upon the records of earlier lunar eclipses. From this difference, Hipparchus discovered that the longitudes of the stars had changed over time, which led him to determine the first value of the precession of the equinoxes as no less than 1/100° per year.

In approximately 3rd century BC, with the help of Aristillus, he created the first star catalogue in the Western world.

The crater Timocharis on the Moon is named after him.

==Influence==
Galileo assigns to Arsatilis and Timocharis the origin &quot;third opinion&quot; on the number of heavens, namely that there were nine heavens, seven for the planets, one for the daily movement of the firmament from east to west, and another for the slower motion from west to east, while crediting Hipparchus, Agrias, Milaeus and Ptolemy with improving the model. This was when Galileo was of the opinion that there were ten movable heavens, and an eleventh immovable.

<doc id="236986" wikidata="Q165271" url="?curid=236986" title="Lens, Pas-de-Calais">
<text>Lens (; ) is a city in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France. It is one of the main towns of Hauts-de-France along with Lille, Valenciennes, Amiens, Roubaix, Tourcoing, Arras and Douai. The inhabitants are called &quot;Lensois&quot; ().

==Metropolitan area==
Lens belongs to the intercommunality of Lens-Liévin, which consists of 36 communes, with a total population of 242,000. Lens, along with Douai and 65 other communes, forms the agglomeration (&quot;unité urbaine&quot;) of Douai-Lens, whose population as of 2018 was 504,281.

==History==
Lens was initially a fortification from the Norman invasions. In 1180, it was owned by the Count of Flanders, and sovereignty was exercised by the Crown of France. In the 13th century, Lens received a charter from Louis VIII of France, allowing it to become a city. The Flemish razed the city in 1303. Prior to this, the city&#x27;s population relied on its markets. In 1526, Lens was made part of the Spanish Netherlands under the ownership of the French monarchy, and only passed back to France on 7 November 1659 with the Treaty of the Pyrenees.

In 1849, coal was discovered in Lens after surveys were carried out at Annay, Courrières and Loos-en-Gohelle. This led to the expansion of the city into an important industrial center as part of the Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin. The Lens Mining Company was founded in 1852 and experienced large profits. The city, occupied from 1914 to 1918, was largely destroyed in the First World War and its population of 18,000 fell by half. In World War II, the Allies bombarded the city from the air, leaving 500 dead and 1,000 buildings destroyed. A new Hôtel de Ville was erected in 1965.

The last coal mine in Lens closed in 1986. The Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin was made a UNESCO Heritage site in 2012,
and the Louvre-Lens art museum was opened the same year.

== Education ==
Lens is the site of one of the five campuses of the University of Artois.

==Transport==
The Lens railway station, built in 1927, is served by regional trains towards Lille, Arras, Douai, Dunkirk, Calais and Valenciennes. It is also connected to the TGV network, with high speed trains to Paris. It is served by the Lens-Béthune bus network, with bus services running across Lens and connecting it to nearby towns.

==Sport==

Football club RC Lens plays in the town. Their stadium, Stade Bollaert-Delelis, was used for UEFA Euro 1984, the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016 and the 1999 Rugby World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

<doc id="236988" wikidata="Q1347226" url="?curid=236988" title="Salam Pax">
<text>Salam Pax is the pseudonym of Salam Abdulmunem (), aka Salam al-Janabi (), under which he became the &quot;most famous blogger in the world&quot; during and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Along with a massive readership, his site &quot;Where is Raed?&quot; received notable media attention. The pseudonym consists of the word for &quot;peace&quot; in Arabic (&quot;salām&quot;) and in Latin (&quot;pax&quot;). His was one of the first instances of an individual&#x27;s blog having a wide audience and impact.

== Biography ==
Salam Abdulmunem (the name he uses now, based on Abd al-Munim) was born to a well-to-do secular family in Baghdad in 1973. His father Adnan Abd al-Munim al-Janabi, a Sunni, worked for OPEC, his mother was a Shi&#x27;ite, while Salam himself became skeptical of religion. He travelled to Vienna, Austria, with his parents when he was 5, the family returned to Baghdad five years later. At 16 years old Salam returned to Austria alone in order to study at the Vienna International School where he became fluent in English in addition to German and his native Arabic.

When he went through his yearly allowance from back home in a month, his family brought him to Iraq in 1995, where Salam continued his study of architecture at the University of Baghdad. He described the first two years as the most difficult period in his life:

I felt lost somewhere between the East and the West. I did not know where I belonged for a long time.

After graduation, he worked for the Baghdad office of a Beirut, Lebanon, architectural consultancy and as an occasional interpreter for foreign journalists before and during the invasion of Iraq, when he became a successful English-language blogger under the name &quot;Salam Pax&quot; and a contributor to &quot;The Guardian&quot; beginning from 4 June 2003. He moved to London in 2007, where he took up journalism at City University London, and then lived in Beirut. Salam Abdulmunem returned to Baghdad in 2009 and started working as Communications Officer for UNICEF in Iraq in 2010.

==&quot;Where is Raed?&quot;==
In his blog, Salam discussed his friends, disappearances of people under the government of Saddam Hussein, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and his work as an interpreter for journalist Peter Maass. The title of Salam&#x27;s site referred to his friend Raed Jarrar, who was working on his master&#x27;s degree in Jordan at that time. Raed did not respond promptly to e-mails, so Salam set up the weblog for him to read. Salam continued to post updates to the site even after it was temporarily blocked in Iraq. During the war, he gave accounts of bombings and other attacks from his suburb of Baghdad until his Internet access (and the electrical grid) was interrupted. Salam remained offline for weeks, writing his diary entries on paper in order to post them later.

Putting an end to earlier doubts and speculations about the blog&#x27;s authenticity, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper tracked its author down in May 2003 and printed a story confirming that the person behind the pseudonym &quot;Salam Pax&quot; indeed lived in Iraq, that Salam was his real first (given) name, and that he was a 29-year-old architect. Subsequent entries discussed the chaotic postwar economy, and a June 1, 2003, post appeared to celebrate an anarchist effort, centered in the western Al-Adel Neighborhood of Baghdad, to provide free Internet access to all of Iraq. It turned out not to be instigated by political anarchists, but by Iraqis who ran the prewar Internet cafes in Baghdad for Uruknet, the former government ISP.

==&quot;The Baghdad Blog&quot; and other reporting==
In 2003 Atlantic Books, in association with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, published a book based on &quot;Where is Raed?&quot; under the title &quot;The Baghdad Blog&quot; (). It comprises Salam&#x27;s blog entries from September 2002 to June 2003 with footnotes.

In August 2004, after not having updated his previous blog for several months, Pax started a second blog titled &quot;shut up you fat whiner!&quot; He also worked as a journalist for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, writing columns and featured articles. In October 2004 he was sent to the United States by &quot;The Guardian&quot; to report on the American presidential race and current thought there on the subject of Iraq.

In February 2005 a series of filmed reports by Salam Pax, produced by Guardian Films and transmitted by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; television programme, won the Royal Television Society Award for Innovation. In his &quot;Newsnight&quot; report broadcast in October 2005, he interviewed Iraqi Member of Parliament Adnan al-Janabi, a Sunni moderate who served as vice-chair of the constitutional committee, about the proposed Iraqi constitution and revealed that al-Janabi was his father. Salam also mentioned that his mother was Shia, and described his family as being secular in political orientation.

==Quotes==

* &quot;23/3 8:30pm (day4) we start counting the hours from the moment one of the news channels report that the B52s have left their airfield. It takes them around 6 hours to get to Iraq. On the first day of the bombing it worked precisely. Yesterday we were a bit surprised that after 6 hours bombs didn&#x27;t start falling. The attacks on Baghdad were much less than two days ago. We found out today in the news that the city of Tikrit got the hell bombed out of it. Today the B52s took off at 3pm, in half an hour we will know whether it is Baghdad tonight or another city.&quot;
* &quot;One day, like in Afghanistan, those journalists will get bored and go write about Syria or Iran; Iraq will be off your media radar. Out of sight, out of mind. Lucky you, you have that option. I have to live it.&quot;
* &quot;There were days when the Red Crescent was begging for volunteers to help in taking the bodies of dead people off the city street and bury them properly. The hospital grounds have been turned to burial grounds..&quot;
* &quot;You can follow the trail of the foreigners by how much things cost in a certain district.&quot;
* &quot;Anyway, all that doesn&#x27;t matter now. Saddam is gone, thanks to you. Was it worth it? Be assured it was. We all know that it got to a point where we would have never been rid of Saddam without foreign intervention; I just wish it would have been a bit better planned.&quot;

<text>The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome (commonly called the Metrodome) was a domed sports stadium in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. It opened in 1982 as a replacement for Metropolitan Stadium, the former home of the National Football League&#x27;s (NFL) Minnesota Vikings and Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) Minnesota Twins, and Memorial Stadium, the former home of the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team.

The Metrodome was the home of the Vikings from 1982 to 2013, the Twins from 1982 to 2009, the National Basketball Association&#x27;s (NBA) Minnesota Timberwolves in their 1989–90 inaugural season, the Golden Gophers football team from 1982 to 2008, and the occasional home of the Golden Gophers baseball team from 1985 to 2010 and their full-time home in 2012. It was also the home of the Minnesota Strikers of the North American Soccer League in 1984. The Vikings played at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s TCF Bank Stadium for the 2014 and 2015 NFL seasons, ahead of the planned opening of U.S. Bank Stadium in 2016.

The stadium had a fiberglass fabric roof that was self-supported by air pressure and was the third major sports facility to have this feature (the first two being the Pontiac Silverdome and the Carrier Dome). The Metrodome was similar in design to the former RCA Dome and to BC Place, though BC Place was reconfigured with a retractable roof in 2010. The Metrodome was the inspiration for the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan. The stadium was the only facility to have hosted a Super Bowl (1992), World Series (1987, 1991), MLB All-Star Game (1985), and NCAA Division I Basketball Final Four (1992, 2001).

The Metrodome had several nicknames such as &quot;The Dome&quot;, &quot;The Thunderdome&quot;, &quot;The Homer Dome&quot;, and &quot;The Technodome&quot;. Preparation for the demolition of the Metrodome began the day after the facility hosted its final home game for the Minnesota Vikings on December 29, 2013, and the roof was deflated and demolition began on January 18, 2014. The Metrodome was torn down in sections while construction of U.S. Bank Stadium began.

==History==
=== Background ===

By the early 1970s, the Minnesota Vikings were unhappy with Metropolitan Stadium&#x27;s (the Met) relatively small capacity for football. Before the completion of the AFL–NFL merger, the NFL declared that stadiums with a capacity under 50,000 were not adequate. The Met never held more than 49,700 people for football, and could not be expanded. At the time, the biggest stadium in the area was the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Memorial Stadium. However, the Vikings were unwilling to be tenants in a college football stadium even on a temporary basis, and demanded a new venue. Supporters of a dome also believed that the Minnesota Twins would benefit from a climate-controlled stadium to insulate the team from harsh Minnesota weather later in their season. The Met would have likely needed to be replaced anyway, as it was not well maintained. Broken railings and seats could be seen in the upper deck by the 1970s; by its final season, they had become a distinct safety hazard.

Construction success of other domed stadiums, particularly the Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit, paved the way for voters to approve funding for a new stadium. Downtown Minneapolis was beginning a revitalization program, and the return of professional sports from suburban Bloomington was seen as a major success story; a professional team had not been based in downtown Minneapolis since the Minneapolis Lakers left for Los Angeles in 1960.

=== Construction ===
Construction on the Metrodome began on December 20, 1979, and was funded by a limited hotel-motel and liquor tax, local business donations, and payments established within a special tax district near the stadium site. &quot;Uncovering the Dome&quot; by Amy Klobuchar (now a U.S. Senator) describes the 10-year effort to build the venue. The stadium was named in memory of former mayor of Minneapolis, U.S. Senator, and U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who died in 1978. The building&#x27;s construction was designed by Bangladeshi-American architect Fazlur Rahman Khan, of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.

The Metrodome itself cost $68 million to build—significantly under budget—totaling around $124 million with infrastructure and other costs associated with the project added. It was a somewhat utilitarian facility, though not quite as spartan as Metropolitan Stadium. One stadium official once said that all the Metrodome was designed to do was &quot;get fans in, let &#x27;em see a game, and let &#x27;em go home.&quot;

=== 1980s roof incidents ===
Five times in the stadium&#x27;s history, heavy snows or other weather conditions have significantly damaged the roof and in four instances caused it to deflate. Four of the five incidents occurred within the stadium&#x27;s first five years of operation: On November 19, 1981, a rapid accumulation of over a foot of snow caused the roof to collapse, requiring it to be re-inflated. It deflated the following winter on December 30, 1982, because of a tear caused by a crane used in snow removal. This was four days before the Vikings played the Dallas Cowboys in the last regular-season game of the 1982 NFL season. In the spring following that same winter, on April 14, 1983, the Metrodome roof deflated because of a tear caused by late-season heavy snow, and the scheduled Twins game with the California Angels was postponed. On April 26, 1986, the Metrodome roof suffered a slight tear because of high winds, causing a nine-minute delay in the bottom of the seventh inning versus the Angels; however, the roof did not deflate.

====2010 roof incident and replacement====

A severe snowstorm arrived in Minneapolis in the late evening of December 10. The snowstorm lasted to the following night on December 11, with of snow accumulated across the city. Due to strong winds, hoses malfunctioning, and a hazardous slippery layer building up on the roof, workers were not allowed to remove the snow from the roof. As the workers were pulled back, many noticed that the roof&#x27;s center was sagging down by the weight of the snow.

At around 5:00 a.m. CST on December 12, three of the roof&#x27;s panels tore open. Snow fell through, covering the turf field. The night before the incident a Fox Sports crew, who were setting up for the football game between the New York Giants and Vikings, noticed water was leaking through the roof. They decided to leave their cameras on; the cameras captured footage of the roof deflation and the snow dropping to the field. The footage was aired on &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; and quickly went viral.

The game between the Vikings and Giants, scheduled to take place on December 12 during the afternoon, was postponed to the next day and relocated to Ford Field in Detroit. There were considerations moving the game to the University of Minnesota&#x27;s nearby TCF Bank Stadium. However, the stadium had limited seating capacity, as well as snow that would have taken several days to clear. A couple of days later, a fourth panel ripped open, allowing more snow to enter the stadium. This forced another game between the Vikings and Chicago Bears (originally scheduled at the Metrodome on December 20) to be relocated to TCF Bank Stadium. The final two games for the Vikings for the season were on the road, and the Vikings were already eliminated from the playoffs, meaning no additional home games were to be played.

The roof collapse also caused schedule complications for the Golden Gophers baseball team. All Big Ten Conference home games were moved to Target Field, the home stadium of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) Minnesota Twins. A Metrodome tournament was replaced with a three-game series against Gonzaga. Another tournament named the Dairy Queen Classic was relocated to Tucson, Arizona. Other changes included many home game cancellations, and some games being pushed to next year&#x27;s season.

On February 10, 2011, it was announced that the entire Metrodome roof needed to be replaced at an estimated cost of $18 million. In November 2010, the University of Minnesota men&#x27;s baseball team had announced plans to play all of their 2011 games at the Metrodome; however, the roof collapse caused those plans to be abandoned. On February 18, 2011, the Gophers announced that all 12 scheduled Big Ten home games in April and May would be played at Target Field, with three non-conference games moved to on-campus Siebert Field.

On July 13, 2011, it was announced that the roof was repaired and had been inflated that morning. However, other construction and repairs were still in progress. The remaining construction and repairs were done by August 1, 2011.
=== Demolition ===

With the approval of the new Vikings stadium at the Metrodome site by the Minnesota legislature, the fate of the Metrodome was sealed. The Vikings played their final game at the Metrodome on December 29, 2013, beating the Detroit Lions 14–13. The following day, a local company began removal of seats for sale to the public and various charities and nonprofits. Individual chairs went for $40 each to charities, $60 each to the public and $80 each for specific seat requests.

The roof was deflated for the final time on January 18. On the morning of February 2, 2014, the steel support cables that stretched from end-to-end of stadium that held together the roof were severed, as construction crews set off a simultaneous set of 42 explosive charges that detached the cables from the concrete structure. The general public was not informed about this phase of the demolition process, prompting about a half-dozen phone calls to police from people who wondered what was going on. This was viewed as the final step before the destruction of the concrete bowl of the Metrodome would begin. On February 10, 2014, shortly after 9:15 a.m., after more than two months of preliminary work that dated back all the way to the groundbreaking of the new Vikings stadium, demolition of the stadium walls finally began.
Just after 1 p.m. on February 17, 2014, one week after demolition of the stadium bowl had begun, demolition crews were working on taking down the concrete ring beam that encircled to top of the Metrodome, when a portion of the ring beam collapsed out of sequence, bringing an immediate halt to the work. No one was hurt and no equipment was damaged by the collapse. After five days of investigation from structural and demolition experts, it was decided that the remaining portion of the concrete ring beam would be destroyed using controlled explosive charges—virtually the same method that was used to bring down the Metrodome&#x27;s steel support cables for the roof. This second controlled explosion was a continued deviation from the original plan to not use explosives to destroy the stadium, as it was determined that this was the safest way to bring down the remaining ring beam structure. On February 23, 2014, the remaining ring beam and corners of the Metrodome were brought down with 84 explosive charges of dynamite. This enabled demolition crews to continue with the wrecking ball demolition method that was originally chosen (though the order in which the sections would be brought down were changed as a result of the ring beam implosion), to bring down what was left of the Metrodome. Despite this unexpected setback, Mortenson Construction said that the demolition of the Metrodome and construction of U.S. Bank Stadium were both still on schedule.

On March 15, 2014, the final upper deck bleachers and concrete bleacher-support girders (on the northwest side of the Metrodome) were brought down, taking away any standing remnants of the exterior stadium walls. On April 11, 2014, the final portion of the inner-stadium concrete walls were reduced to rubble, marking the official end of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Demolition of the Metrodome was formally declared complete six days later—a month ahead of schedule—as the final truckload of rubble was loaded up and removed from the new stadium construction site. Officials from Mortenson Construction said the entire demolition job required 4,910 truckloads and 16,000 man hours to complete the job.

=== Usage ===
The Metrodome is the only venue to have hosted an MLB All-Star Game (1985), a Super Bowl (1992), an NCAA Final Four (1992 &amp; 2001), and a World Series (1987 &amp; 1991).

The NCAA Final Four was held at the Metrodome in 1992 and 2001. The Metrodome also served as one of the four regional venues for the NCAA Division I Basketball Championship in 1986, 1989, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009. The dome also held first- and second-round games in the NCAA basketball tournament in addition to regionals and the Final Four, most recently in 2009.

The Metrodome was recognized as one of the loudest venues in which to view a game, due in part to the fact that sound was recycled throughout the stadium because of the fabric domed roof. Stadium loudness is a sports marketing issue, as the noise lends the home team a home advantage against the visiting team. Until its demolition, the Metrodome was the loudest domed NFL stadium; most notably, during the 1987 World Series and 1991 World Series, peak decibel levels were measured at 125 and 118 respectively compared to a jet airliner—both close to the threshold of pain.

The 1991 World Series is considered one of the best of all time. The blue colored seat back and bottom where Kirby Puckett&#x27;s 1991 World Series Game 6 walk-off home run landed in Section 101, Row 5, Seat 27 (renumbered 34 after the home run in honor of Kirby&#x27;s uniform number), is now in the Twins archives, along with the gold-colored back and bottom that replaced it for several years. The Twins reinstalled a blue seat back and bottom as well as Puckett&#x27;s #34 on the seat where it remained until the final Vikings game of 2013 in the Metrodome when, as local media reported, a fan took the #34 plate off the seat. The original World Series armrests and hardware, as well as the replacement blue seat back and bottom, are now part of a private Kirby Puckett collection in Minnesota.

== Features ==
From the time the stadium was built to when it was demolished, the economics of sports marketing changed. Teams began charging higher prices for tickets and demanding more amenities, such as bigger clubhouses and locker rooms, more luxury suites, and more concession revenue. Team owners, the media, and fans pressured the State of Minnesota to provide newer, better facilities to host its teams. The Metrodome served its primary purpose: to provide a climate-controlled facility to host the three sports tenants in Minnesota with the largest attendance.

For Major League baseball, the Metrodome was regarded as a hitter&#x27;s park, with a low (7  ft) left-field fence (343  ft) that favored right-handed power hitters, and the higher (23  ft) but closer (327  ft) right-field Baggie that favored left-handed power hitters. It gave up even more home runs before air conditioning was installed in 1983. Before 1983, the Dome had been nicknamed &quot;the Sweat Box&quot;. The Metrodome was climate controlled, and protected the baseball schedule during the entire time it was the venue for the Minnesota Twins. Major League Baseball schedulers had the luxury of being able to count on dates played at Metrodome. Doubleheader games only occurred when purposely scheduled. The last time that happened was when the Twins scheduled a day-night doubleheader against the Kansas City Royals on August 31, 2007. The doubleheader was necessitated after an August 2 game vs. Kansas City was postponed one day after the I-35W Bridge collapse in downtown Minneapolis.

===Roof===
The Metrodome&#x27;s air-supported roof was designed by the inventor of air-supported structures, David H. Geiger, through his New York-based Geiger Berger Associates, and manufactured and installed by Birdair Structures. An air-supported structure supported by positive air pressure, it required 250,000 ft3/min (120 m3/s) of air to keep it inflated. The air pressure was supplied by 20 fans of each. The roof was made of two layers: the outer layers were Teflon-coated fiberglass and the inner was a proprietary acoustical fabric. By design, the dead air space between the layers insulated the roof; in winter, warm air was blown into space between layers to help melt snow that had accumulated on top. At the time it was built, the of fabric made the roof the largest expanse ever done in that manner. The outside Teflon membrane was of an inch thick and the inner liner of woven fiberglass was of an inch thick. The entire roof weighed roughly . It reached , or about 16 stories, at its highest point.

To prevent roof tears like those that occurred in its first years of service, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission adopted a twofold strategy: When snow accumulation was expected, hot air was pumped into the space between the roof&#x27;s two layers. Workers also climbed on the roof and used steam and high-powered hot-water hoses to melt snow. In addition, before the storm that caused the December 2010 collapse, the inside of the stadium was heated to nearly .

To maintain the differential air pressure, spectators usually entered and left the seating and concourse areas through revolving doors, since the use of regular doors without an airlock would have caused significant loss of air pressure. The double-walled construction allowed warmed air to circulate beneath the top of the dome, melting accumulated snow. A sophisticated environmental control center in the lower part of the stadium was staffed to monitor the weather and make adjustments in air distribution to maintain the roof.

Because it was unusually low to the playing field, the air-inflated dome occasionally figured into game action during baseball games. Major League Baseball had specific ground rules for the Metrodome. Any ball which struck the Dome roof, or objects hanging from it, remained in play; if it landed in foul territory it became a foul ball, if it landed in fair territory it became a fair ball. Any ball which became caught in the roof over fairground was a ground rule double. That has only happened three times in its history – Dave Kingman for the Oakland Athletics on May 4, 1984, the University of Minnesota Gophers player George Behr and Corey Koskie in 2004. The speakers, being closer to the playing surface, were hit more frequently, especially the speakers in foul ground near the infield, which were typically hit several times a season, which posed an extra challenge to infielders trying to catch them. However, beginning with the 2005 season, the ground rules for Twins games were changed such that any batted ball that struck a speaker in the foul territory would automatically be called a foul ball, regardless of whether or not it was caught.

The dome&#x27;s roof color made it close to impossible to catch balls without taking the eye off the ball. As a result, fielders frequently lost balls in the roof. An example of this is seen in a home run derby put on by a softball entertainment crew before a Twins game. Taken at the field level, the balls generally tended to be lost in the roof.

===The field===

During its early years of operation, the field at the Metrodome was surfaced with SuperTurf. The surface, also known as SporTurf, was very bouncy—so bouncy, in fact, that Billy Martin once protested a game after seeing a base hit that would normally be a pop single turn into a ground-rule double. Baseball and football players alike complained that it was too hard.

This surface was upgraded to AstroTurf in 1987, and in 2004, the sports commission had a newer artificial surface, called FieldTurf, installed. FieldTurf is thought to be a closer approximation to natural grass than Astroturf in its softness, appearance, and feel. A new Sportexe Momentum Turf surface was installed during the summer of 2010.

When the conversion between football and baseball took place, the pitcher&#x27;s mound was raised and lowered by an electric motor. The mound weighed and was in diameter. With the field repair, the sliding pits and pitcher&#x27;s mound used by the Twins and Gophers were removed. Any future baseball games would see baserunners slide on &quot;grass&quot;. The home plate area was kept, as it was not &quot;in-play&quot; for football configuration. The original home plate installed at the dome was memorably dug up after the Twins&#x27; final game and has been installed at Target Field. A new field was installed in the summer of 2011 due to the damage from the December 2010 roof collapse.

===Plexiglas===
From 1985 to 1994, the left-field wall included a clear Plexiglas screen for a total height of . It was off this Plexiglas wall that Twins player Kirby Puckett jumped to rob Ron Gant of the Atlanta Braves of an extra-base hit during Game 6 of the 1991 World Series (a game that Puckett would win with an 11th-inning walk-off homer) – in later years, with the Plexiglas removed, it would have been a potential home run ball.

===Stadium neighborhood===
The Metrodome was constructed in an area of downtown Minneapolis known as &quot;Industry Square&quot;. Development in the Downtown East neighborhood around Metrodome took many years to materialize. For many years, there were few bars or restaurants nearby where fans could gather, and tailgating was expressly forbidden in most parking areas. The City of Minneapolis was directing the development of the entertainment districts along with Seven Corners in Cedar-Riverside, Hennepin Avenue, and the Warehouse district. The Metrodome existed among several parking areas built upon old rail yards, along with defunct factories and warehouses. The Star Tribune owns several blocks nearby that have remained parking lots. The Metrodome was not connected to the Minneapolis Skyway System, although that had been proposed in 1989 to be completed in time to host Super Bowl XXVI. The Star Tribune properties and the Minneapolis Armory had not been developed and stood between the Metrodome and the rest of Downtown Minneapolis. Only in recent years did redevelopment begin moving Southeast to reach the Metrodome. More restaurants, hotels, and condominiums have been built nearby. The METRO Blue Line light rail connected the Minneapolis entertainment district with the Metrodome and the Airport.

===Sight lines===
The Metrodome was not a true multi-purpose stadium. Rather, it was built as a football stadium that could convert into a baseball stadium. The seating configuration was almost rectangular in shape, with the baseball field tucked into one corner. The seats along the four straight sides directly faced their corresponding seats on the opposite side, while the seats in the corners were four quarter-circles.

While this was more than suitable for the Vikings and Gophers, with few exceptions this resulted in poor sightlines for baseball. For instance, the seats directly along the left-field line faced the center field and right field fences. Unlike other major league parks, there were no seats down to field level. Only 8,000 seats were located in the lower deck between home plate and the dugouts, where most game action occurs. Seats in these areas were popularly known as &quot;the baseball section.&quot; However, even the closest front-row seats were at least above the field.

The way that many seats were situated forced some fans to crane their necks to see the area between the pitcher&#x27;s mound and home plate. Some fans near the foul poles had to turn more than 80°, compared to less than 70° with the original Yankee Stadium or 75° at Camden Yards. For that reason, the seats down the left-field line were typically among the last ones sold; the (less expensive) outfield lower deck seating tended to fill up sooner. Nearly 1,400 seats were at least partially obstructed – some of them due to the right-field upper deck being directly above (and somewhat overhanging) the folded-up football seats behind right field; and some of them due to steel beams in the back rows of the upper deck which are part of the dome&#x27;s support system.

On the plus side, there was relatively little foul territory, which was not typical of most domed stadiums (especially those primarily built for football). Also, with the infield tucked into one corner of the stadium, the seats in the so-called &quot;baseball section&quot; had some of the closest views in Major League Baseball. In 2007, the Twins began selling seats in extra rows behind the plate which were previously only used for football. The sight lines were also very good in the right field corner, which faced the infield and was closer to the action than the left field corner.

Unlike most domed stadiums, the Metrodome&#x27;s baseball configuration had asymmetrical outfield dimensions.

The Twins stopped selling most of the seats in sections 203–212 of the upper level in 1996. This area was usually curtained off during the regular season. However, the stadium could easily be expanded to full capacity for the postseason, or when popular opponents came to town during the regular season.

===Scheduling conflicts===
As part of the deal with Metrodome, the Minnesota Twins had post-season priority over the Gophers in scheduling. If the Twins were in the playoffs with a home series, the baseball game took priority and the Gopher football game had to be moved to a time suitable to allow the grounds crew to convert the playing field and the stands to the football configuration.

The last month of Major League Baseball&#x27;s regular season often included one or two Saturdays in which the Twins and Gophers used Metrodome on the same day. On those occasions, the Twins game would start at about 11 am local time (TV announcer Dick Bremer sometimes joked that the broadcast was competing with &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;). Afterward, the conversion took place and the Gophers football game started at about 6 pm. The University of Minnesota was the only school in the Big Ten that shared a football facility with professional sports teams for an extended period of years.

In 2007, there were two such schedule conflicts, on September 1 and 22. In 2008, there were no conflicts on the regular-season schedule.

Due to the minimum time needed to convert the field, a baseball game that ran long in clock time had to be suspended, and concluded the next day. The only time this happened was on October 2, 2004, when a game between the Twins and Indians reached the end of the 11th inning after 2:30 pm in a tie and resumed the next day.

The Vikings had rights to the Dome over the Twins except for World Series games. In 1987, the Vikings&#x27; home date with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers scheduled for the same day as Game 2 of the World Series was moved to Tampa, and the Vikings&#x27; game with the Denver Broncos scheduled for the same day as Game 7 was pushed back to the following Monday night.

The Twins&#x27; 2009 AL Central division tiebreaker with the Detroit Tigers was played on Tuesday, October 6, 2009. One-game playoffs are normally held the day after the regular season ends (in this case, the season ended on Sunday, October 4), but the Vikings were using Metrodome for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; on October 5. The Twins were awarded the right to host the tiebreaker because they won the season series against Detroit.

===Minnesota Vikings football===


As the stadium was designed first and foremost for the Minnesota Vikings, they had the fewest problems. However, the economics of 21st century professional sports meant that the Vikings owners wanted more luxury suites and better concessions. Renovations were rejected twice, with the 2001 price tag at $269 million.

The Vikings played their first game at the Metrodome in a preseason matchup against the Seattle Seahawks on August 21, 1982. Minnesota won 7–3. The first touchdown in the dome was scored by Joe Senser on an 11-yard pass from Tommy Kramer. The first regular-season game at the Metrodome was the 1982 opener on September 12, when the Vikings defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 17–10. Rickey Young scored the first regular-season touchdown in the dome on a 3-yard run in the 2nd quarter. On January 9, 1983, the Vikings defeated the Atlanta Falcons, 30–24, in a 1st-round game that was the first playoff game at the Metrodome. On January 17, 1999, the Falcons defeated the Vikings in the first NFC championship game played at the Metrodome. On December 29, 2013, the Vikings played their final game at the Metrodome, a 14–13 victory over the Detroit Lions. The team&#x27;s record at the dome was 162–88 in the regular season and 6–4 in playoff games. They finished with a perfect record at the dome against the Arizona Cardinals (8–0), Baltimore Ravens (1–0), Cincinnati Bengals (4–0), and Houston Texans (1–0), but with a winless record there against the New York Jets (0–3).

====Super Bowl XXVI====
NFL owners voted during their May 24, 1989, meeting to award Super Bowl XXVI to Minneapolis over Indianapolis, Pontiac and Seattle. The game on January 26, 1992, was the second Super Bowl to be played in a cold, winter climate city. The first one was Super Bowl XVI on January 24, 1982, in Pontiac, Michigan. Super Bowl XXVI resulted in the Washington Redskins defeating the Buffalo Bills, 37–24.

===Minnesota Twins baseball===

When opened in 1982, the Metrodome was appreciated for the protection it gave from mosquitoes, and later the weather. Over the years there had been a love-hate relationship with the fans, sportswriters, and stadium.
The Minnesota Twins won two World Series championships at the Metrodome. The Twins won the 1987 World Series and 1991 World Series by winning all four games held at the Dome in both seasons. The loud noise, white roof, quick turf, and the right-field wall (or &quot;Baggie&quot;) provided a substantial home-field advantage for the Twins. The 1991 World Series has been considered one of the best of all time.

For Twins baseball, the address of the Metrodome became 34 Kirby Puckett Place, an honor given to one of the most famous Minnesota Twins players. In 1996, a section of Chicago Avenue in front of the Metrodome was renamed Kirby Puckett Place by the city of Minneapolis. The Metrodome Plaza was added along Kirby Puckett Place before the 1996 season. Before that, the address for the Twins was 501 Chicago Avenue South. For baseball, the Metrodome informally has been called &quot;The House That Puck Built&quot;.

By 2001, several newer purpose-built Major League Baseball stadiums had been constructed, and the Metrodome was considered to be among the worst venues in Major League Baseball.

Only two Twins games at the Metrodome were ever postponed. The first was on April 14, 1983, when a massive snowstorm prevented the California Angels from getting to Minneapolis. The game would have likely been postponed in any case, however; that night heavy snow caused part of the roof to collapse. The second was on August 2, 2007, the day after the I-35W Mississippi River bridge had collapsed a few blocks away from the Metrodome. The game scheduled for August 1 was played as scheduled (about one hour after the bridge had collapsed) because the team and police officials were concerned about too many fans departing Metrodome at one time, potentially causing conflict with rescue workers. The August 2 ceremonial groundbreaking at the eventual Target Field was also postponed, for the same reason. The Metrodome carried a memorial decal on the backstop wall for the remainder of the 2007 season.

The Twins played their final scheduled regular-season game at the Metrodome on October 4, 2009, beating the Kansas City Royals, 13–4. After the game, they held their scheduled farewell celebration. Because they ended the day tied with the Detroit Tigers for first place in the American League Central, a one-game playoff between the teams was played there on October 6, 2009, with the Twins beating the Tigers 6–5 in 12 innings. The division clincher would be the Twins&#x27; last win at the Metrodome. The announced crowd was 54,088, setting the regular-season attendance record.

The final Twins game at the Metrodome was on October 11, 2009, when they lost to the New York Yankees 4–1, resulting in a three-game sweep in the 2009 ALDS. The Twins&#x27; appearance in this series gave Metrodome the distinction of being the first American League stadium to end its Major League Baseball history with post-season play. The only other stadiums whose final games came in the postseason are Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta (1996), the Astrodome in Houston (1999) and Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis (2005), all of which were home venues for National League teams. With the departure of the Twins, this leaves the Tampa Bay Rays as the last remaining major league team to play their games in a non-retractable domed stadium.

===Basketball===
When configured as a basketball arena, the fans in the nearby bleachers got a suitable view of the court, but the action was difficult to see in the upper decks. Concessions were very far away from the temporary infrastructure. The Metrodome as a basketball arena was much larger than most NBA and major college basketball arenas, which run to about 20,000 seats; it functioned like Syracuse&#x27;s large Carrier Dome. However, the NCAA made a significant amount of money selling the high number of seats for regional and championship games for the men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

Ten NCAA tournaments took place at the stadium:
*1986 1st and 2nd round
*1989 Midwest Regional
*1991 1st and 2nd round
*1992 Final Four
*1996 Midwest Regional

*2000 1st and 2nd round
*2001 Final Four
*2003 Midwest Regional
*2006 Minneapolis Regional
*2009 1st and 2nd round
The Timberwolves used the stadium for their home games during their inaugural season (1989–90) in the NBA while the team waited for construction of Target Center to be completed. The team set NBA records for the highest single-season attendance ever: 1,072,572 fans in 41 home games. The largest crowd for a single game occurred on April 17, 1990: 49,551 fans watched the T-Wolves lose to the Denver Nuggets in the last game of the season. This was the third-largest crowd in the NBA&#x27;s history.

===College football===

Beginning in the 1982 college football season, the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers began playing their home football games at the Metrodome. The first game was a 57–3 victory over the Ohio Bobcats on September 11, 1982. The Gophers football record at the Metrodome 1982–2008 (27 seasons) 169 total games 87–80–2 .521%. 109 Big Ten Conference games 41–66–2 .385%

With the Gophers&#x27; move to TCF Bank Stadium, only one Power Four program still plays in a domed stadium. Syracuse has its own such facility on campus. When the Gophers first moved to the Metrodome, the NFL-class facilities were seen as an improvement over the aging Memorial Stadium. Initially, attendance increased. However, fans waxed nostalgic over fall days playing outdoors on campus. Huntington Bank Stadium now provides an outdoor, on-campus venue for the team.

===College baseball===
In the 2010 season, the University of Minnesota Golden Gopher Baseball team played all of their home games at the Metrodome (except a game at the new Target Field on March 27, 2010). The University of Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball team had played games at the Metrodome during February and March since 1985 because of weather. Later games were played at Siebert Field, except for 2006 when all but two home games were played at the Metrodome. The team often played major tournaments at the Dome, which included the Dairy Queen Classic, where three other major Division I baseball teams play in an invitational. Before the NCAA&#x27;s 2008 rule in Division I regarding the start of the college baseball season, the Golden Gophers would often play home games at the Metrodome earlier than other teams in the area to neutralize the advantage of warmer-weather schools starting their seasons earlier in the year. Some early Big Ten conference games were played at the Metrodome, and the Golden Gophers enjoyed home-field advantage during the early part of the season before the weather warmed, and the Gophers could play games on-campus. Other small colleges also played games in the stadium during the weeks before the Metrodome was open for Division I play. In 2010, 420 amateur baseball and softball games—including the majority of the Golden Gophers&#x27; home schedule—were played at the Metrodome.

The size of Siebert Field also affected the Golden Gophers starting in 2010. The Golden Gophers last hosted an NCAA baseball tournament regional in 2000, with temporary seating added. With the Metrodome being available for the tournament starting in 2010, the team could easily place a bid for, and have a better possibility of hosting, an NCAA baseball regional or super regional.

Other cold-weather teams have played at the Metrodome. Big 12 Conference member Kansas has played two series (2007 and 2010) at the Metrodome because of inclement weather against South Dakota State University and Eastern Michigan, respectively.

===Soccer===
The Minnesota Kicks were supposed to move into the Metrodome for the 1982 NASL season. However, the franchise folded in November 1981. The Minnesota Strikers played the 1984 NASL season at the Dome. 52,621 saw the Minnesota Strikers defeat Tampa Bay 1–0 on May 28, 1984. MSHSL boys and girls soccer championships were also held at the stadium. The Minnesota Thunder played selected games at the Dome from 1990 to 2009. Minnesota Stars FC, later renamed to Minnesota United FC, opened their 2012 season at the stadium and used it for the 2013 NASL spring season. The field dimensions for soccer at the Metrodome were . The largest crowd to see a soccer game in Minnesota was at the Metrodome.

===Large concerts===
The concert capacity of the Metrodome was around 60,000 people, depending on seating and stage configurations, which made it a profitable location for stadium tours during the late 80s and 90s. By comparison, the Target Center in Minneapolis has a concert capacity of up to 20,500. Acoustics at the Metrodome for these concerts were &quot;iffy at best&quot;.

===Naming rights===

In 2009, Mall of America purchased naming rights for the field at Metrodome. The contract stated that the field would be called &quot;Mall of America Field at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome&quot; for a three-year period, beginning October 5, 2009, and ending February 28, 2012. The name was still used for the 2012 and 2013 seasons.

Despite possible inference from the signage, the MoA name applied only to the field, not the stadium as a whole. The building remained Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The connection between Mall of America and the Metrodome is also notable because Mall of America is built on the site of the former Metropolitan Stadium. The mall and the dome were located about apart from each other.

==Replacement facilities==
With the passage of time, the Metrodome was thought to be an increasingly poor fit for its three major tenants, all of whom claimed the stadium was nearing the end of its useful life.

One major complaint was about the concourses, which were considered somewhat narrow by modern standards, making for cramped conditions whenever attendance was anywhere near capacity. During a 2010 Vikings game, Fox Sports&#x27; Alex Marvez wrote that the Metrodome&#x27;s passageways were so cramped that it would be difficult for fans to evacuate in the event of an emergency. Two of the former tenants, the Gophers (football) and Twins, moved out, while the Vikings played their final years there until demolition. The Vikings&#x27; 2014 and 2015 seasons were played at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s TCF Bank Stadium, and U.S. Bank Stadium, built on the Metrodome site, opened in time for the team&#x27;s 2016 season.

The Twins, the Vikings, and the Gophers all proposed replacements for the Metrodome, and all three were accepted. The first of the three major tenants to move was the Gophers, who opened their new TCF Bank Stadium (now Huntington Bank Stadium) in September 2009. The next to depart were the Twins, whose new Target Field was completed in time for Opening Day 2010. On May 10, 2012, the Vikings were granted a new stadium by the Minnesota legislators that was built on the Metrodome site, which opened for the 2016 NFL season. Governor Mark Dayton signed the bill on May 14.

===Minnesota Twins===
The Twins moved to their new ballpark, Target Field, in 2010, after attaining their new stadium with an effort that began in the mid-1990s. Although indoor baseball had critics when Metrodome opened, it was positively regarded by players and fans. By 2001, with Metrodome&#x27;s peculiarities revealed, and several newer purpose-built Major League Baseball stadiums constructed, an ESPN Page 2 reader poll ranked it as one of the worst Major League Baseball stadiums. Twins management claimed Metrodome generated too little revenue for the Twins to be competitive; specifically, they received no revenue from luxury suite leasing (as those were owned by the Vikings) and only a small percentage of concessions sales. This came to a head in 2001, when the Twins were nearly contracted along with the Montreal Expos, who were also generating insufficient revenue and had a stadium in poor condition. Also, the percentage of season-ticket-quality seats was said to be very low compared to other stadiums. From 2003 through 2009, the Twins had year-to-year leases, and could have moved to another city at any time. However, with no large American markets or new major-league-quality stadiums existing without a current team, it was accepted that the Twins could not profit from a move. The Twins sought a taxpayer subsidy of more than $200 million to assist in construction of the stadium. On January 9, 2005, the Twins went to court to argue that their Metrodome lease should be considered &quot;dead&quot; after the 2005 season. In February, the district court ruled that the Twins&#x27; lease was year-to-year and the team could vacate Metrodome at the end of the 2005 season.

In late April 2007, Hennepin County officially took over the future ballpark site (through a form of eminent domain called &quot;quick-take&quot;) which had been an ongoing struggle between the county and the land owners. On October 15, 2007, the two sides reached a negotiated settlement of just under $29 million, ending the dispute. As a result, the county noted it would have to cut back on some improvements to the surrounding streetscapes, though it also revealed that the Pohlad family had committed another $15 million for infrastructure.

===University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football===
The Minnesota Golden Gophers football program began playing in Metrodome for the 1982 season. Attendance was expected to increase over the old Memorial Stadium attendance, especially for late fall games, due to the climate controlled comfort. Initially, average attendance had increased over previous seasons at Memorial Stadium. But, the venue was removed from the traditional on-campus football atmosphere if fans wanted to attend a Gophers football game. Students had to take a bus from the campus to the stadium. The distance from the main campus, along with poor performance by the Gopher football team, caused interest to wane.

The Gophers officially moved back onto campus, to TCF Bank Stadium, for the 2009 football season. The university believed an on-campus stadium would motivate its student base for increased ticket sales, and also would benefit from athletic revenues, not only for the football program, but the non-revenue sports as well. The new stadium reportedly cost less than half of a current-era NFL-style football stadium, and was built on what were former surface parking lots just a few blocks east of the former Memorial Stadium, with the naming rights purchased by TCF Financial Corporation. The University of Minnesota expected to raise more than half the cost of the stadium via private donations. The Gopher Stadium bill was passed by both houses on May 20, 2006, the day before the Twins Stadium bill passed. On May 24, 2006, Governor Pawlenty signed the Gopher bill on the university campus.

===Minnesota Vikings===
The Vikings initially supported a Superfund site in Arden Hills, but costs of developing infrastructure made the site unworkable. A number of sites in Minneapolis were floated before the team and state settled on a location adjacent to and including the current Metrodome site.

On May 10, 2012, the Minnesota Legislature approved funding for a new Vikings stadium on that site. The project had a budget of $1.027 billion, of which the Vikings covered $529 million, the state covered $348 million, and the remaining $150 million was covered by a Minneapolis hospitality tax. The bill was signed by Governor Dayton on May 14. The Vikings played in the Metrodome until the end of the 2013 season. The Vikings&#x27; temporary home during construction was TCF Bank Stadium.

<text>The money market is a component of the economy that provides short-term funds. The money market deals in short-term loans, generally for a period of a year or less.

As short-term securities became a commodity, the money market became a component of the financial market for assets involved in short-term borrowing, lending, buying and selling with original maturities of one year or less. Trading in money markets is done over the counter and is wholesale.

There are several money market instruments in most Western countries, including treasury bills, commercial paper, banker&#x27;s acceptances, deposits, certificates of deposit, bills of exchange, repurchase agreements, federal funds, and short-lived mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The instruments bear differing maturities, currencies, credit risks, and structures.
A market can be described as a money market if it is composed of highly liquid, short-term assets. Money market funds typically invest in government securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper of companies, and other highly liquid, low-risk securities. The four most relevant types of money are commodity money, fiat money, fiduciary money (cheques, banknotes), and commercial bank money. Commodity money relies on intrinsically valuable commodities that act as a medium of exchange. Fiat money, on the other hand, gets its value from a government order.

Money markets, which provide liquidity for the global financial system including for capital markets, are part of the broader system of financial markets.

== Participants ==
The money market consists of financial institutions and dealers in money or credit who wish to either borrow or lend. Participants borrow and lend for short periods, typically up to twelve months. Money market trades in short-term financial instruments commonly called &quot;paper&quot;. This contrasts with the capital market for longer-term funding, which is supplied by bonds and equity.

The heart of the money market revolves around the concept of interbank lending, where banks lend and borrow from each other using financial instruments such as commercial paper and repurchase agreements. These instruments are often valued with reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the specific term and currency.

Finance companies usually secure their funding by issuing substantial amounts of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). This paper is backed by the commitment of valuable assets placed into an ABCP conduit. These assets can include things like auto loans, credit card receivables, residential or commercial mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, and other financial assets. Some large, financially stable corporations even issue their own commercial paper, while others prefer to have banks issue it on their behalf.

In the United States, federal, state and local governments all issue paper to meet funding needs. States and local governments issue municipal paper, while the U.S. Treasury issues Treasury bills to fund the U.S. public debt:
* Trading companies often purchase bankers&#x27; acceptances to tender for payment to overseas suppliers.
* Retail and institutional money market funds
* Banks
* Central banks
* Cash management programs 
* Merchant banks

== Functions ==

Money markets serve five functions—to finance trade, finance industry, invest profitably, enhance commercial banks&#x27; self-sufficiency, and lubricate central bank policies.

===Financing trade===
The money market plays a crucial role in financing domestic and international trade. Commercial finance is made available to the traders through bills of exchange, which are discounted by the bill market. The acceptance houses and discount markets help in financing foreign trade.

===Financing industry===
The money market contributes to the growth of industries in two ways:
* They help industries secure short-term loans to meet their working capital requirements through the system of finance bills, commercial papers, etc.
* Industries generally need long-term loans, which are provided in the capital market. However, the capital market depends upon the nature of and the conditions in the money market. The short-term interest rates of the money market influence the long-term interest rates of the capital market. Thus, money market indirectly helps the industries through its link with and influence on long-term capital market.

===Profitable investments===
The money market enables commercial banks to use their excess reserves in profitable investments. The main objective of commercial banks is to earn income from its reserves as well as maintain liquidity to meet the uncertain cash demand of its depositors. In the money market, the excess reserves of commercial banks are invested in near money assets (e.g., short-term bills of exchange), which are easily converted into cash. Thus, commercial banks earn profits without sacrificing liquidity.

===Self-sufficiency of commercial banks===
Developed money markets help commercial banks to become self-sufficient. In an emergency, when commercial banks have scarcity of funds, they need not approach the central bank and borrow at a higher interest rate. They can instead meet their requirements by from the money market.

===Help to Central Bank===
Though the central bank can function and influence the banking system in the absence of a money market, the existence of a developed money market significantly enhances monetary policy transmission and central bank efficiency.

Money markets help central banks in three primary ways:

Interest Rate Signaling: Short-term interest rates in money markets serve as immediate indicators of monetary and banking conditions, guiding central bank policy decisions. As Chen &amp; Valcarcel (2021) demonstrate, money market rates respond quickly to policy changes, providing real-time feedback on policy effectiveness. Bech &amp; Klee (2011) further show how segmentation in money markets can affect this transmission mechanism.

Policy Implementation: Well-integrated money markets enable central banks to achieve widespread influence across financial sub-markets efficiently. When the central bank adjusts its policy rate, these changes transmit rapidly through interbank markets to other financial instruments and ultimately to the broader economy. Carpenter &amp; Demiralp (2012) highlight how this transmission has evolved beyond traditional money multiplier frameworks.

Liquidity Management: Money markets facilitate efficient distribution of liquidity among financial institutions, reducing the need for direct central bank intervention. This market-based approach to liquidity allocation improves the overall efficiency of monetary policy operations. However, as Brunnermeier &amp; Koby (2018) note, there are limits to the effectiveness of monetary policy through these channels, particularly in low-interest-rate environments.

== Instruments ==
* Certificate of deposit – Time deposit, commonly offered to consumers by banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions.
* Repurchase agreements – Short-term loans—normally for less than one week and frequently for one day—arranged by selling securities to an investor with an agreement to repurchase them at a fixed price on a fixed date.
*Money market mutual funds - short-term investment debt, operated by professional institutions. Money market mutual funds are an investment fund where a number of investors invest their money in mutual fund institutions, and they diversify the funds in various investments. 
* Commercial paper – Short term instruments promissory notes issued by company at discount to face value and redeemed at face value
* Eurodollar deposit – Deposits made in U.S. dollars at a bank or bank branch located outside the United States.
* Federal agency short-term securities – In the U.S., short-term securities issued by government sponsored enterprises such as the Farm Credit System, the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal National Mortgage Association. Money markets is heavily used function.
* Federal funds – In the U.S., interest-bearing deposits held by banks and other depository institutions at the Federal Reserve; these are immediately available funds that institutions borrow or lend, usually on an overnight basis. They are lent for the federal funds rate.
* Municipal notes – In the U.S., short-term notes issued by municipalities in anticipation of tax receipts or other revenues
* Treasury bills – Short-term debt obligations of a national government that are issued to mature in three to twelve months
* Money funds – Pooled short-maturity, high-quality investments that buy money market securities on behalf of retail or institutional investors
* Foreign exchange swaps – Exchanging a set of currencies in spot date and the reversal of the exchange of currencies at a predetermined time in the future
* Short-lived mortgage- and asset-backed securities

=== Discount and accrual instruments ===
There are two types of instruments in the fixed income market that pay interest at maturity, instead of as coupons—discount instruments and accrual instruments. Discount instruments, like repurchase agreements, are issued at a discount of face value, and their maturity value is the face value. Accrual instruments are issued at face value and mature at face value plus interest.

<doc id="237003" wikidata="Q282675" url="?curid=237003" title="Target Center">
<text>Target Center is a multi-purpose arena located in Minneapolis that opened in 1990. It hosts major family shows, concerts, sporting events, graduations and private events. Target Corporation, founded and headquartered in Minneapolis since 1902, has held the naming rights to the arena since its opening.

The arena has been the home to the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA) since its opening and is currently also the home of the Minnesota Lynx of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). The Minnesota Myth and the Target Center announced that the Myth would be playing their home games there for the 2024 Arena Football Season. The facility has also hosted the LFL&#x27;s Minnesota Valkyrie, the RHI&#x27;s Minnesota Arctic Blast, the IHL&#x27;s Minnesota Moose, and the Arena Football League&#x27;s Minnesota Fighting Pike in the past.

Target Center is the second-oldest arena in the NBA after Madison Square Garden, which was built in 1968.

==History==


===Management===
Original Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner built, owned and operated the arena for five years beginning in 1990. The venue was managed by Ogden Entertainment after the city of Minneapolis purchased the arena in 1995. Glen Taylor acquired the Timberwolves in 1994 and the Lynx in 1999.

In 2000, SFX (later Clear Channel Entertainment) took over the contract. The management was changed in May 2004 from Clear Channel to Midwest Entertainment Group, a joint venture of the Timberwolves and Nederlander Concerts.

On May 2, 2007, AEG Facilities assumed the management contract of Target Center. The city of Minneapolis owns the arena and AEG Facilities manages day-to-day operations.

===Renovations===
In 2004, Target Center underwent a major renovation that saw the replacement of all 19,006 of its original seats plus the addition of nearly 1,500 new seats as well as the reconfiguration of the lower bowl to make the arena more &quot;fan-friendly&quot;. In addition the arena&#x27;s original scoreboard was replaced with a new video screen and LED signage, LED signage on the upper deck fascia, a new lounge (Club Cambria) and improved access for fans with disabilities.

Target Center was once one of three NBA arenas with parquet floors, including TD Garden in Boston, and Amway Arena (later Amway Center) in Orlando—the floor was replaced prior to the 2007–08 NBA season.

Target Center is the first arena to have a green roof. It was unveiled on September 15, 2009. In February 2011, the Timberwolves and the city of Minneapolis introduced a $155 million proposal to remodel the Target Center. Plans included shifting the main entrance to the corner of 6th Street and First Avenue, two large glass atriums, another restaurant, and a complete remodel of the interior. The plan was approved in 2012 by the Minnesota Legislature, as part of the bill that authorized a new stadium for the Minnesota Vikings.

On April 3, 2015, the Minneapolis City Council gave the final approval for renovation plans for Target Center. The total cost was $140 million, which upgraded the exterior, seats, technology and loading bays, among other areas. The city contributed $74 million. Glen Taylor, owner of the Timberwolves and Lynx, paid a total of $60 million; AEG contributed $5.9 million. As a result, the Timberwolves&#x27; lease will run until 2035. The renovated building reopened in October 2017.

===Naming rights===
On August 7, 1990, it was announced that American retail chain Target had purchased the naming rights of the Timberwolves&#x27; arena and that it would be called Target Center. Since then, the naming rights have been renewed every five years. Target last renewed its naming rights in October 2015 for an undisclosed length of time.

==Basketball==
It hosted the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, the 1995 NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four, 2000 NBA draft and the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game. It had been slated to host an NCAA Men&#x27;s Regional Final in 2021, but on November 16, 2020, the NCAA announced that it would hold the entire tournament in one city, seeming to rule out Minneapolis. The Target Center hosted the 2022 NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four.

In 2011, the Target Center played host to its first championship event, the 2011 WNBA Finals. The Minnesota Lynx won their first two games on their home floor, and ultimately won the WNBA Championship, the first title won by a team that played in Target Center.

On April 20, 2022, it was announced that the Target Center will host the Big Ten women&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2023 and 2024 and the Big Ten men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2024.

==Ice hockey==
The NHL&#x27;s Minnesota North Stars refused to move into Target Center upon its opening due to conflicting soft drink rights (their home at the time, the Met Center was served by Pepsi whereas the Target Center&#x27;s pouring rights belonged to Coca-Cola). Despite this, the arena did host 6 neutral site NHL games during the 1993–94 NHL season after the North Stars&#x27; departure to Dallas, including one in which the Stars participated. The International Hockey League&#x27;s Minnesota Moose played several of their games at Target Center during their existence from 1994 to 1996. The Boys&#x27; State High School Hockey Tournament was held at Target Center in 1998 and 1999. In June 2012, it was announced that the arena would play host to the future NCHC tournament games starting in 2014. The NCHC moved the tournament to the Xcel Energy Center (home of the Twin Cities&#x27; current NHL franchise, the Wild) in nearby St. Paul starting in 2018.

==Notable events==

===Concerts===
The arena has been a popular venue that has hosted many concerts, including artists like Taylor Swift, Billy Joel, Celine Dion, Garth Brooks, Lana Del Rey, Justin Bieber, Megan Thee Stallion, Elton John, Twenty One Pilots, Katy Perry, Melanie Martinez, Dua Lipa, The Spice Girls, Doja Cat, One Direction, Sabrina Carpenter, Metallica, Pantera, Paul McCartney, Nicki Minaj, and Minnesota legend Prince.

===MMA and professional wrestling===
WWE has held many events at this venue and is best known for SummerSlam 1999, Judgment Day 2005, Bragging Rights 2010, Elimination Chamber 2014, and .

Professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling taped an episode of their weekly television show &quot;AEW Rampage&quot; at the center on November 12, 2021. The center also hosted that year&#x27;s edition of their annual pay-per-view event Full Gear, which occurred the following day. AEW made their Dynamite taping debut on August 10, 2022, for a special episode entitled &quot;Quake by the Lake&quot;

The Target Center held the memorable UFC championship UFC 87: Seek and Destroy in August 2008, which featured the Welterweight title match where Georges St-Pierre defeated Jon Fitch.

On October 5, 2012, UFC on FX: Browne vs. Bigfoot was held at the venue.

On June 29, 2019, UFC on ESPN: Ngannou vs. dos Santos was held at the venue.

===Gymnastics===
In 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg&#x27;s Tour of Gymnastics Champions.

In 2024, the arena will host the US Olympic Trials for gymnastics for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris from June 27 to 30.

===Other events===

==U.S. Bank Theater==
Target Center can convert into a 2,500-to-7,500-seat theater known as the U.S. Bank Theater. The Theater contains a movable floor-to-ceiling curtain system that allows the venue to be transformed based on specific show needs. In addition to concerts, the U.S. Bank Theater can also be used for family and Broadway shows.

==Transportation and location==
Target Center is a block away from the following Metro Transit stations:
* Warehouse District/Hennepin Avenue, served by the Metro Blue and Green light rail lines
* Ramp A/7th St. Transit Center that serves 11 bus routes
* Ramp B/5th St. Transit Center that serves 10 bus routes
The arena is also across the street from the well-known Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue. Target Field, the home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Minnesota Twins, is located just across the street from the Target Center, and shares the public parking that the arena also uses.

<text>Metropolitan Stadium (often referred to as &quot;the Met&quot;, &quot;Met Stadium&quot;, or now &quot;the Old Met&quot; to distinguish from the Metrodome) was an outdoor sports stadium in the north central United States, located in Bloomington, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.

The Minneapolis Millers of Minor League Baseball were the original tenant from 1956 to 1960, but Metropolitan Stadium was best known as the home of the American League&#x27;s Minnesota Twins and the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL); both played at the &quot;Met&quot; for 21 seasons, from 1961 through 1981. The Minnesota Kicks of the North American Soccer League (NASL) also played there from 1976 to 1981.

Southwest of the airport, the stadium site is now the Mall of America, which opened in 1992.

==History==
===Origins and construction===
Beginning in 1953, inspired by the Boston Braves&#x27; move to Milwaukee, Gerald Moore, the president of the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce, led the drive to lure a major league team to Minnesota by constructing a modern stadium built to major league specifications. After the rejection of numerous sites, a stadium committee appointed by Moore approved a plot of farmland in Bloomington. The stadium would replace Nicollet Park as the home of the American Association&#x27;s Minneapolis Millers. The site was approximately equidistant from the downtowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and it was believed this would be the best location for a prospective major league team. Earlier, the 1950 Census indicated that the Twin Cities and their suburbs had over a million people between them, the unofficial threshold for a major metropolitan area.

After a plan by architects Thorshov &amp; Cerny won approval, groundbreaking was scheduled to begin on June 20, 1955. The construction was almost delayed, however, when the owners of the property began a protest, claiming they had not yet been paid. One of these owners created a barricade of farm equipment along his property line that ran directly through the future infield. The dispute was settled in time for the groundbreaking to move forward as planned. Many spectators and dignitaries attended the groundbreaking, including Minneapolis mayor Eric G. Hoyer and several members of the Minneapolis Millers.

On February 7, 1956, an accident occurred on the construction site when a portable heater used to cure concrete exploded in the stadium&#x27;s basement. After $50,000 of repairs and a three-week delay in construction, Metropolitan Stadium opened in time to hold its first game, a minor league contest between the Millers and the Wichita Braves on April 24 of that year. (At the time of its opening, the stadium still lacked an official name; the park was not named until a July announcement declaring it &quot;Metropolitan Stadium&quot;.)

In the 1950s, major league owners Calvin Griffith and Horace Stoneham called the stadium the finest facility in the minors; Stoneham added that &quot;there were not two better&quot; major league stadiums of the time (although not specifying which specific two he thought were the Met&#x27;s equal) The Millers were then the top farm team of Stoneham&#x27;s New York Giants, and there was some hope or expectation that the Giants might relocate there. Under major league rules of the time, by virtue of owning the Millers, the Giants owned the major league rights to Minneapolis. Negotiations were also held with Griffith&#x27;s Washington Senators, as well as the Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians, and Philadelphia Athletics. However, the Giants chose to follow the Brooklyn Dodgers to the west coast at the urging of Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley, who owned the Millers&#x27; crosstown rivals, the St. Paul Saints. San Francisco had long been home to the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s San Francisco Seals, the top farm team of the Boston Red Sox. As part of the deal, the Millers&#x27; parent team then became the Red Sox, who had no plans to move anywhere in the foreseeable future.

Multiple exhibition games featuring Major League teams were held at the Met at this time; a game between the Detroit Tigers and Cincinnati Reds was held at the Met in 1957, another between the San Francisco Giants and Chicago White Sox in May, 1958, and a matchup between the Senators and the Philadelphia Phillies was held shortly after the 1958 All-Star break. The latter game brought 15,990 fans to the stadium, including Calvin Griffith, who described the stadium as &quot;terrific.&quot;

===Baseball and American football===

In October 1960, Calvin Griffith announced that his Washington Senators would move to Metropolitan Stadium as the Minnesota Twins. The Twins played their first home game on April 21, 1961, with a loss to the new Washington Senators (now the Texas Rangers). The Millers and Saints were then promptly folded by Major League Baseball. To ready the stadium for the Twins, a $9 million renovation increased the seating capacity from about 22,000 to over 30,000 by the completion of the Twins&#x27; inaugural season. During the Twins&#x27; first ten seasons at the Met, they outdrew the average American League team each year.

The National Football League (NFL) was also interested in placing a team at the Met. Conversations were had with Violet Bidwill Wolfner, owner of the Chicago Cardinals, about moving her team to the stadium. The Cardinals moved two of their 1959 regular season home games against the Philadelphia Eagles (October 25) (att: 20,112) and New York Giants (November 22) (att: 26,625) to Bloomington. A preseason football game was held each September at the Met for its first five years, 1956 through 1960:

*September 15, – Pittsburgh Steelers 14 Philadelphia Eagles 12 (att: 14,742)
*September 21, – Green Bay 10 Pittsburgh 10 (att: 17,226)
*September 21, – Chicago Cardinals 31 Green Bay 24 (att: 18,520)
*September 20, – Green Bay 13 Pittsburgh 10 (att: 18,018)
*September 11, – Green Bay 28 Dallas Cowboys 23 (att: 20,151)

The Met finally got a football team when the new American Football League (AFL) announced Minneapolis–St. Paul as one of its charter cities for the inaugural 1960 season. However, the NFL persuaded the team&#x27;s owners to pull out of the AFL in January 1960 and join the NFL as an expansion team in , and was later named the Minnesota Vikings. As it turned out, the year&#x27;s delay worked to the Vikings&#x27; benefit. By the time the Vikings played their first game, the Twins had moved in and the Met had been expanded to befit its new status as a big-league stadium. (The Chicago Cardinals, after playing two games in Bloomington in 1959, announced in March 1960 that they were moving to St. Louis.)
The park had a disjointed, skeletal feel; it was obvious that it had once been a minor league baseball stadium. For instance, when bleachers were erected to expand the stadium for the Twins, no concourse was built to connect them to the rest of the stadium. Due to this design flaw, fans in the bleachers literally had to leave the stadium to get to the grandstand. Unlike most multipurpose stadiums built during this time, there were very few bad seats for baseball. The stadium was built using cantilever construction for the overhanging decks, eliminating posts that blocked the fans&#x27; view. It was well known as a hitter&#x27;s park; its short foul lines— to left (east), to right (south)—were particularly friendly to pull hitters such as Harmon Killebrew. The 330 marker in right was actually closer to right-center, leading to speculation that right field was even closer. Since the Met was built in 1956, however, this would not have been a problem for the Twins; baseball required all parks built after 1958 to have foul lines of at least . Met Stadium distance signs included meters 1974–77. The diamond was aligned southeast (home plate to center field); recommended alignment is east-northeast.

The Met was often considered less than ideal for football. The gridiron ran from around third base to right field (north-south), with barely enough room to fit the playing field and end zones. Wooden bleachers were brought onto the field during football season to bring fans closer to the game. For 1965, a large double-decked grandstand was installed in left field to replace the temporary wooden bleachers. The Vikings actually paid for this new grandstand in return for reduced rent; this location was prime sideline seating in the football configuration. This left the Met with the unique configuration of a double deck in left field, and bleachers behind third base. The left-field grandstand was originally planned to be capable of sliding toward or away from the gridiron (as Denver&#x27;s Mile High Stadium later would be), but that part of the project was never realized.

The Met provided an overwhelming home-field advantage for the Vikings late in the season and in the playoffs due to Minnesota&#x27;s famously cold temperatures. The Vikings hosted ten playoff games at the Met and won seven of them.

In the 1965 baseball season, both the All-Star Game and the World Series were played at Metropolitan Stadium, one of the few times that coincidence has happened since the former event was inaugurated in 1933. (Game 7 of that year&#x27;s World Series drew 50,596 fans to the Met, the only time a baseball crowd exceeded 50,000 and remained its attendance record for baseball.) The Vikings hosted and won the 1969 NFL Championship Game at the stadium, the last NFL game prior to the merger.

===Soccer and other events===

Metropolitan Stadium was the home of the Minnesota Kicks soccer team from 1976 until the team folded in November 1981. The Kicks, members of the North American Soccer League (NASL), were highly anticipated in Minnesota and had to delay their first game at the Met by fifteen minutes to accommodate the large crowd waiting to buy tickets. To help speed things along, the Kicks&#x27; owners let two thousand fans enter the stadium for free. An NASL attendance record was set one month later, when Pelé and the New York Cosmos drew 46,164 fans to Metropolitan Stadium. Large crowds continued for the Kicks, who drew 41,505 for that year&#x27;s opening playoff game. Four days later, another record was set when 49,571 fans came to see the Kicks defeat San Jose, 3–1. The team enjoyed great success in their first four seasons in Minnesota, winning a division title each year. Attendance dipped toward the end of the franchise&#x27;s history, however, with an average of 16,605 per game in 1981, their final season. The size of the field for soccer games was 100 by 72 yards 1976–78 and 104 by 72 yards 1979–81.

====Concerts====
The Met also hosted multiple concerts.

====Wrestling====
Numerous wrestling matches were held at Metropolitan Stadium, including contests featuring Hard Boiled Haggerty, Bob Geigel, Wilbur Snyder, Kay Noble, Lord Littlebrook, Verne Gagne, Gene Kiniski, Rene Goulet, Larry Hennig, Hans Schmidt, Mad Dog Vachon and Dick the Bruiser.

===Final years and demise===
Although the Met was responsible for bringing MLB and the NFL to the Twin Cities, it had not aged well. By the early 1970s, the Vikings were making noises about moving out. For instance, there was no prospect of building permanent seats along third base. The Vikings weren&#x27;t willing to pay to build seats in an area that would have been in the end zone in the football configuration, and the Twins couldn&#x27;t afford it. At one point, there were plans to place a dome over Metropolitan Stadium, or build a new football stadium located between the Met and the Met Center, which had opened in 1967 just north of the Met. It soon became apparent that, at the very least, the Vikings would need a new stadium. As part of the AFL–NFL merger, the NFL declared that stadiums with less than 50,000 seats were inadequate for its needs; at its height the Met only seated 49,700 people for football (48,400 at the time of closure) and any expansion would have resulted in seats that would have been of no use for the Twins during baseball&#x27;s regular season. However, the Vikings would not even consider playing at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Memorial Stadium even on a temporary basis.

Discussions for a new stadium actually began in 1970, with six years remaining in both the Twins&#x27; and Vikings&#x27; leases. While the initial talks focused on a stadium for the Vikings, the Twins quickly joined the discussions. The idea of a dome was particularly appealing to Griffith given the bitterly cold weather that is common in the Twin Cities early and late in baseball season. This accelerated the push for construction of a new stadium, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which was completed in 1982.
However, it is very likely that a new stadium would have been needed in any event, as the Met was not well maintained. By the park&#x27;s final season, broken railings in the grandstand&#x27;s third deck had become a major safety hazard. Additionally, players had begun to complain about the Met&#x27;s playing conditions; the infield in particular was considered the worst in the majors. Rumors abounded that the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, which by then had taken over the stadium from the city of Minneapolis, had deliberately let the Met go to seed in order to aid the push for the Metrodome.

The Minnesota Kicks&#x27; last regular season game at Met Stadium was a 2–1 victory over the Dallas Tornado on August 19, 1981. A week later, the team&#x27;s last game at the Met was a 1-0 shoot-out playoff victory over the Tulsa Roughnecks. The team&#x27;s last game played was a home playoff loss, 3–0 to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, on September 6, 1981. The game was moved to Memorial Stadium due to a scheduling conflict with the Twins.
The Twins played their last game at the Met on September 30, 1981, losing to the Kansas City Royals 5–2 on a rainy afternoon. The night before the final game, home plate was stolen, and after the final game ended, hundreds of fans gathered on the field, searching (mostly unsuccessfully) for mementoes.

The Vikings played their last game on December 20, 1981, dropping a 10–6 decision to the Kansas City Chiefs. By this time, the Vikings had been eliminated from playoff contention. Knowing that fans would be more determined to claim souvenirs at what would almost certainly be the Met’s last major event, the Vikings tripled their security force for the contest. In the game&#x27;s final minutes, many of the 41,110 fans in attendance began dismantling seats and bleachers, and thousands stormed the field once the game ended. The goal posts were torn down, pieces of the field were dug up, and speakers and lightbulbs on the scoreboard were removed. Hundreds of injuries were reported, mostly minor scrapes and bruises but also multiple head injuries sustained during the melee.

Met Stadium was officially abandoned when the Vikings and the Twins moved to the Metrodome in January 1982, and the Kicks folded after the 1981 soccer season. For the next three years, Met Stadium sat unused, decaying, and highly vandalized. Demolition for Metropolitan Stadium kicked off in 1985 on January 28, and continued for the next four months. After the rubble was cleared, the lot sat vacant for several years, although the nearby Met Center continued to provide entertainment for NHL hockey fans for another decade.

==After the Met==
The Mall of America, which opened in 1992, stands on the site of what is now nostalgically called &quot;the Old Met.&quot; A brass plaque in the shape of home plate, embedded in the floor in the northwest corner of Nickelodeon Universe, commemorates the site&#x27;s days as a sports venue by marking where home plate once sat. Near the opposite corner, mounted high on the wall, is a red stadium seat denoting the precise landing spot (including elevation) of Harmon Killebrew&#x27;s home run, a blast to the upper deck in deep left-center field on June 3, 1967. This was the longest homer of Killebrew&#x27;s career, and the longest ever hit in Metropolitan Stadium. The Met&#x27;s outfield seating featured green bleacher-style benches and seats, yet the seat the ball hit was painted red and could be seen from all other seats in the stadium.

For a time, there was talk of building a new park for the Twins on the old Met site that would be connected to the Mall of America. However, the terms of the agreement in which the land was sold to Triple Five Group, owners of the Mall of America, do not allow another stadium to be built on the site. Even without this to consider, the site is now directly in a flight path for Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport.

The old flagpole at the stadium was purchased by the Minneapolis/Richfield American Legion Post when the stadium was razed. The pole was sold back to the Twins and restored in ; it was then placed in the plaza at Target Field.

<text>Sir Guy Stephen Montague Green, (born 26 July 1937) is a retired Australian judge who served as the Governor of Tasmania from 1995 to 2003. He was the first Tasmanian-born governor of the state, although not the first Australian-born.

==Early life and career==
Guy Green was born in Launceston, Tasmania, and attended the Launceston Church Grammar School. He studied law at the University of Tasmania&#x27;s Hobart Campus, graduating with honours in 1960. He was Chief Justice of Tasmania from 1973 until 1995, the culmination of a distinguished career in law in Tasmania, which saw him serve as a magistrate from 1971 to 1973.

Green was also heavily involved in the University of Tasmania, serving as chancellor before his appointment as governor. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by the university in 1996. Sir Guy was also chancellor of the Australian Priory of the Order of St John of Jerusalem before assuming Vice-Regal office.

On 11 May 2003, the Governor-General, Peter Hollingworth, stood aside following a controversy about his past handling of child abuse allegations. Green, the longest-serving state governor, was appointed Administrator of the Commonwealth, or in effect acting governor-general. Hollingworth later announced that he would not be returning to the position. Green served as administrator until Michael Jeffery took office in August 2003. He retired afterwards and was replaced as Tasmanian governor by Richard Butler.

Green was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1982, appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1994, and appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order during Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s visit to Tasmania in 2000. He was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001.

On retiring from the governorship, Green continued to contribute to Tasmania, as chairman of trustees of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and chairman of the board of the 10 Days on the Island festival.

Green was a member (1975-1980) of the Australian Board of The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s International Award and during this period was the Tasmanian Chairman for the Award.

<text>The International Monetary Market (IMM), a related exchange created within the old Chicago Mercantile Exchange and largely the creation of Leo Melamed, was one of four divisions of the CME Group (CME), the largest futures exchange in the United States, for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures. The IMM was started in December 1971, foreign exchange futures was started on May 16, 1972, and the IMM was merged into the CME in 1986. Two of the more prevalent contracts traded are currency futures and interest rate futures, specifically, 3-month Eurodollar time deposits and 90-day U.S. Treasury bills. The other two CME divisions includes the Index and Option Market (IOM) and Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM). All products fall under one of these three divisions.

<text>Vimy ( or ; ) is a commune in the French department of Pas-de-Calais. Located west of Vimy is the Canadian National Vimy Memorial dedicated to the Battle of Vimy Ridge and the Canadian soldiers who were killed during the First World War. The Memorial is also the site of two Canadian cemeteries.

==Geography and history==
Vimy is a farming town, situated some north of Arras, at the junction of the D51 and the N17 roads. It is situated on the crest of Vimy Ridge, a prominent feature overlooking the Artois region.

The town was first mentioned in 1183 as &quot;Viniarcum&quot; and was the scene of much fighting during the fourteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries among the French, English, Dutch and Spanish forces.

The ridge was the scene of fierce fighting in the First World War. Seized by the Germans in 1914, it was the subject of a French assault in 1915. In 1917 the Battle of Vimy Ridge took place southeast of Vimy and was an important battle of the war for Canadian military history. The town was practically destroyed during the fighting in the area.

==Places of interest==
===Canadian National Vimy Memorial Park===
Set on the highest point of Vimy Ridge, the Canadian National Vimy Memorial is the largest of Canada&#x27;s war monuments. In 1922, use of the land for the battlefield park which contains the memorial was granted, in perpetuity, by the French nation to the people of Canada in recognition of Canada&#x27;s war efforts. of the former Vimy Ridge battlefield is preserved as part of the memorial park which surrounds the monument. The grounds of the site are still honeycombed with wartime tunnels, trenches and craters, closed off for public safety.

The project took designer Walter Seymour Allward 11 years to see built. (The total cost was $1.5 million, which is over $20 million in present terms.) King Edward VIII unveiled it on 26 July 1936 in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun and a crowd of over 50,000 including over 6200 Canadian veterans and their families.

Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen Elizabeth II re-dedicated the monument on 9 April 2007 at a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. A new $10 million visitor center was completed before the 9 April 2017 commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the battle. The event was anticipated to be attended by as many as 30,000 people. 
The official ceremony included comments by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Governor General David Johnston as representative of the Monarchy of Canada, Prince Charles as representative of the Monarchy of the United Kingdom, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry, the President of France François Hollande, and the Prime Minister of France Bernard Cazeneuve.

===Town of Vimy===
The territory of the commune or local authority of Vimy is urban. It had 4,265 inhabitants in 2017. Historic sites within its boundaries include:
* The church of St. Martin, rebuilt, along with much of the village, after World War I
* The remains of a thirteenth-century castle, destroyed in 1833, now the site of the current town hall

==Population==
==Twin towns==
*Horley in Surrey, England.
*Fischach in Bavaria, Germany.

<doc id="237012" wikidata="Q1060355" url="?curid=237012" title="Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha">
<text>Simeon Borisov Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (, ; born 16 June 1937) is a Bulgarian politician who reigned as the last Tsar of the Tsardom of Bulgaria as Simeon II from 1943 until 1946. In 1946, the monarchy was abolished by a referendum, forcing Simeon into exile. Following the fall of communism in Bulgaria, Simeon returned to his home country in 1996, and founded the National Movement for Stability and Progress party (also known as the National Movement Simeon II party). After winning the 2001 election as its leader, Simeon proceeded to govern Bulgaria as prime minister of the Republic of Bulgaria from 2001 to 2005.&lt;br&gt;

Simeon was six years old when his father Boris III of Bulgaria died in 1943. Royal power was exercised on his behalf by a regency council led by Simeon&#x27;s uncle Kiril, Prince of Preslav, General Nikola Mihov and prime minister, Bogdan Filov.

Following his premiership from 2001 to 2005, in the next election, as leader of NDSV, Simeon entered a coalition government with the Bulgarian Socialist Party, as his party finished second in the election. In 2009, after NDSV failed to win any seats in the National Assembly, he retired from politics.

, Simeon is one of only two living men who were heads of state during World War II, along with the 14th Dalai Lama, although both held mostly symbolic roles in their government&#x27;s position.

== Royal history ==
Simeon was born to Boris III of Bulgaria and Giovanna of Italy. Following his birth, Boris III sent an air force officer to the Jordan River to obtain water for Simeon&#x27;s baptism in the Orthodox faith. He succeeded to the throne on 28 August 1943 upon the death of his father, who had just returned to Bulgaria from a meeting with Adolf Hitler. Since Simeon was only six years old, his uncle Prince Kiril, Prime Minister Bogdan Filov, and Lt. General Nikola Mihov of the Bulgarian Army were appointed regents.

Under his father, Bulgaria joined the Axis powers in World War II but managed to preserve diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Still, on 5 September 1944 Stalin declared war on Bulgaria and three days later, the Red Army entered the country without encountering resistance. On the next day, 9 September 1944, Prince Kiril and the other regents were deposed by a Soviet-backed coup and arrested. The three regents, all members of the last three governments, Parliament deputies, heads of the army and eminent journalists were executed by the Communists in February 1947.

== Towards exile ==
The royal family — Queen Giovanna, Simeon, and his sister Maria-Louisa — remained at Vrana Palace, near Sofia, while three new regents were appointed, all Communists (Todor Pavlov, Venelin Ganev and Tsvetko Boboshevski). On 15 September 1946, a referendum was held in the presence of the Soviet army. It proposed abolishing the monarchy and declaring a republic. Official figures showed a 95.6% approval for ending 68 years of monarchy. This referendum actually violated the Tarnovo Constitution, which held that any change in the form of the state could only be implemented by a Grand National Assembly convened by the tsar.

On 16 September 1946, the royal family was exiled from Bulgaria while given a way to take out large amount of movable property. They first went to Alexandria, Egypt, where Simeon&#x27;s grandfather Victor Emmanuel III, the former king of Italy, lived in exile. There, in 1951, Simeon studied at Victoria College (along with Crown Prince Leka of Albania). In July 1951, General Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship in Spain granted asylum to the family. He took part in the ship tour organized by King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederica in 1954, which became known as the &quot;Cruise of the Kings&quot; and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.

== Education and business career ==
In Madrid, Simeon studied at the Lycée Français. On 16 June 1955, upon turning 18, in accordance with the Tarnovo Constitution, Simeon read a proclamation to the Bulgarian people, claiming that he was Tsar of Bulgaria and confirming his will to be Tsar of all Bulgarians and to follow the principles contrary to those of the communist regime then ruling Bulgaria. In 1958, he enrolled at Valley Forge Military Academy and College in the United States, where he was known as &quot;Cadet Rylski No. 6883&quot;, and he graduated as a second lieutenant. Once again in Spain (between 1959 and 1962), Simeon studied law and business administration.

He then became a businessman. For thirteen years, he was chairman of the Spanish subsidiary of Thomson, a French defense and electronics group. He was also an adviser in the banking, hotel, electronics, and catering sectors.

== Marriage and issue ==
On 21 January 1962, Simeon married Spanish aristocrat, &quot;Doña&quot; Margarita Gómez-Acebo y Cejuela. The couple had five children – four sons (Kardam, Kiril, Kubrat and Konstantin) and a daughter, Kalina, all of whom subsequently married Spaniards. All of his sons received names of Bulgarian Tsars, his daughter has a Bulgarian name, although only four of his eleven grandchildren have Bulgarian names (Boris, Sofia, Mirko and Simeon).
* Kardam (1962–2015) married Miriam Ungría y López. They had two sons, Boris and Beltran.
* Kiril (born 1964) married María del Rosario Nadal y Fuster de Puigdórfila. They have three children: Mafalda, Olimpia and Tassilo.
* Kubrat (born 1965) married Carla María de la Soledad Royo-Villanova y Urrestarazu. They have three sons: Mirko, Lukás and Tirso.
* Konstantin-Assen (born 1967) married María García de la Rasilla y Gortázar. They have twins, Umberto and Sofia.
* Kalina (born 1972) married Antonio José &quot;Kitín&quot; Muñoz y Valcárcel. They have a son, Simeon Hassan Muñoz.

== Political return ==
In 1990, just months after the fall of communism, Simeon was issued a new Bulgarian passport. In 1996, fifty years after the abolition of the monarchy, Simeon returned to Bulgaria and was met in many places by crowds of approval. He did not, at that point, make any political announcements or moves, as he had already denied in a TV interview (1990) to have any material property claims against Bulgaria. However, these social sentiments gradually disappeared after his premiership, with Simeon making moves to take back large areas or real estate property in Bulgaria that was under the monarchy&#x27;s governance before 1945.

In 2001, Simeon, who had by this time taken the name &quot;Simeon Borisov Saxe-Coburg-Gotha&quot;, announced he would return to Bulgaria to form a new political party, the National Movement Simeon II (later renamed to NMSP), dedicated to &quot;reforms and political integrity.&quot; Simeon promised that in 800 days the Bulgarian people would feel tangible positive effects of his government and would enjoy significantly higher standards of living.

=== Prime minister ===
NMSP won a large victory in the parliamentary elections held on 17 June 2001, capturing 120 of the 240 seats in Parliament and defeating the two main pre-existing political parties. Simeon was sworn in as Prime Minister of Bulgaria on 24 July, forming a coalition with the ethnic Turkish-led party, Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF). He gave ministerial positions in his government mainly to technocrats and Western-educated economic specialists.

During his time in power, he received the Path to Peace Award from the Path to Peace Foundation in 2002. Bulgaria next joined NATO and joined the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq. 

In the 2005 elections, Simeon&#x27;s party ranked second and participated in the grand coalition government led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party and including the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. Simeon was given the unofficial ceremonial post of Chairman of the Coalition Council.

In the 2009 elections, the party got just 3.01% of the votes and no parliamentary seats. Shortly after, on 6 July, Simeon also resigned as NMSP leader.

== Views on restoration of the Bulgarian monarchy ==
Although not yet formally renouncing his claim to the Bulgarian throne, Simeon and his family take part in long orchestrated media campaigns and moves throughout Bulgarian political space. He used the title &quot;Tsar of the Bulgarians&quot; in his political statements during his exile. Since his return to Bulgaria, however, Simeon has consistently avoided revealing his views on the restoration of the Bulgarian monarchy, notwithstanding the original name of his party. Upon taking office as Prime Minister, Simeon swore to uphold the republican constitution.

== Autobiography ==
Simeon wrote an autobiography in French under the title &quot;Siméon II de Bulgarie, un destin singulier&quot; that was released in Bulgaria on 28 October 2014. It was first presented at the headquarters of the UNESCO in Paris on 22 October 2014.

<doc id="237014" wikidata="Q526999" url="?curid=237014" title="Quorum">
<text>A quorum is the minimum number of members of a group necessary to constitute the group at a meeting. In a deliberative assembly (a body that uses parliamentary procedure, such as a legislature), a quorum is necessary to conduct the business of that group. In contrast, a plenum is a meeting of the full (or rarely nearly full) body. A body, or a meeting or vote of it, is quorate if a quorum is present (or casts valid votes).

The term &quot;quorum&quot; is from a Middle English wording of the commission formerly issued to justices of the peace, derived from Latin &quot;quorum&quot;, &quot;of whom&quot;, genitive plural of &quot;qui&quot;, &quot;who&quot;. As a result, &quot;quora&quot; as plural of &quot;quorum&quot; is not a grammatically well-formed Latin-language construction. In modern times a quorum might be defined as the minimum number of voters needed for a valid election.

Quorums are often required by traditional handbooks of parliamentary procedure such as Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order. However, quorums have been criticized by social choice theorists for their pathological behavior, including an absurd result called a no-show paradox, where a proposal may pass because &quot;too&quot; &quot;many&quot; members oppose it. This has led many jurisdictions and bodies to replace traditional quorums with quorums of votes in favor, i.e. a requirement that any proposal be supported by a certain share of the entire membership to pass (e.g. 25% of all members).

==In &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;==
According to Robert, each assembly determines the number of members that constitutes a quorum in its governing documents (such as in its constitution, charter, bylaws or standing orders). The quorum may also be set by law. &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; states that the quorum set in an organization&#x27;s bylaws &quot;should approximate the largest number that can be depended on to attend any meeting except in very bad weather or other extremely unfavorable conditions.&quot;

In the absence of such a provision, a quorum is an assembly whose membership can be determined is a majority of the entire membership. In the meetings of a convention, unless provided otherwise, a quorum is a majority of registered delegates, even if some have departed. In a mass meeting or in an organization in which the membership cannot be accurately determined, the quorum consists of those who attend the meeting.

In committees and boards, a quorum is a majority of the members of the board or committee unless provided otherwise. The board or committee cannot set its own quorum unless given such power. In a committee of the whole or its variants, a quorum is the same as the assembly unless otherwise provided.

In online groups, a quorum has to be determined in a different manner since no one is actually &quot;present&quot;. The rules establishing such groups would have to prescribe this determination. An example is that a quorum in such groups could be established as &quot;present&quot; if enough members state that they are &quot;present&quot; at the designated meeting time.

===Determination of a quorum===
The chairperson of the group has the responsibility to determine if a quorum is present. In addition, any member can raise a point of order about an apparent absence of a quorum. Because it is difficult to determine exactly when a quorum was lost, points of order relating to the absence of a quorum are &quot;generally not permitted to affect prior action; but upon clear and convincing proof, such a point of order can be given effect retrospectively by a ruling of the presiding officer, subject to appeal.&quot;

===Limited actions in the absence of a quorum===
When a quorum is not met, the assembly can take only limited procedural actions. These limited actions are to fix the time to which to adjourn, adjourn, recess, or take measures to obtain a quorum, such as a motion that absent members be contacted during a recess.

Any other business that is conducted is not valid unless it is ratified at a later meeting where a quorum is present. However, there is no obligation to ratify such action and those responsible may be punished for their actions.

===Call of the house===
In legislatures and other assemblies that have the legal power to compel the attendance of their members, the call of the house procedure may be used to obtain a quorum. This procedure does not exist in ordinary societies, since voluntary associations have no coercive power.

When a call of the house is ordered, the clerk calls the roll of members and then the names of absentees. Members who do not have an excused absence are arrested and brought in. The arrested members may be charged a fee.

Both chambers of the United States Congress have the power to compel the attendance of absent members; this procedure, authorized by Article I, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution is rarely used in the modern Congress.

==By country==

===Australia===
While Section 22 and section 39 of the Constitution of Australia set the quorum for sittings of the House of Representatives and Senate at one-third of the whole number of MPs and senators, respectively, Parliament is permitted to change the quorum for each House by ordinary legislation.

In the House of Representatives, the quorum was amended down to one-fifth by the House of Representatives (Quorum) Act 1989, which means the quorum of the current House of 151 MPs is 31 MPs. In the senate, the quorum was amended down to one-quarter by the Senate (Quorum) Act 1991, so 19 senators is a quorum. The quorum includes the occupant of the Chair, and is not reduced by the death or resignation of a member or senator.

If at the beginning of a sitting the quorum is not met, the bells are rung for five minutes and a count is then taken; if the quorum is still not met the sitting is adjourned until the next sitting day. During the sitting, any MP or senator may draw attention to the lack of quorum in which the bells are rung for four minutes, and if a quorum is still not met the sitting is adjourned.

Although quorum-busting is virtually unheard of in Australia, it is not unknown for parties to deliberately use quorum counts as a disruptive tactic and there have been some suggestions to enact rules to restrict this practice; however, this is very difficult due to the explicit mention of a quorum in the constitution. It is considered disorderly to call attention to quorum when one exists, and members or senators who do so can be punished.

====State and territorial quorums====

=== Austria ===
In the National Council of Austria at least one-third of the representatives must be present, so that they may decide on a simple law (participation quorum of 33.3%). At least half of the members must participate if a constitutional law should pass the parliament (participation quorum of 50% based on the total number of members). Over and above that, constitutional laws require the consent of at least two-thirds of the members present (quorum agreement of 66.6% based on the number of voting present).

===Canada===
In Canada, the Constitution Act, 1867 sets quorum for sittings of the House of Commons of Canada at 20 MPs. If a member calls for quorum to be counted and a first count shows there are fewer than 20 members, bells are rung to call in the members; if after 15 minutes there are still fewer than 20 members, the session is adjourned to the next sitting day; the members present sign a roll on the table of the house, and this list is included in the Journal of the House. There is no need for quorum when the attendance of the House is requested in the Senate of Canada, for example, when royal assent is being given to bills. The quorum of the Senate is 15.

====Provincial and territorial quorums====

=== Germany ===
In the German Bundestag more than half of the members (currently 369 out of 736) must be present so that it is empowered to make resolutions. It is however common that fewer members are present, because they can still make effective decisions as long as no parliamentary group or 5% of the members of the parliament are complaining about the lack of quorum. This, in rare cases, is used by opposition parties to delay votes.

=== Hong Kong ===
Article 75 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong stipulates that the quorum required for the meetings of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) as &quot;not less than one-half of its members&quot;. Between 1997 and 2012 the quorum was 30, and since 2012 it has been 35. Prior to 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the quorum was set at 20.

The quorum for the panels, committees and subcommittees is, nevertheless, one-third or three members, whichever the greater, as according to the Rules of Procedure. The three standing committees, namely, the Finance Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and Committee on Members&#x27; Interests, is exceptional that the quorums are 9, 3 and 3 respectively.

Quorum-busting was used at least twice since 1997. In 2005, when some pro-democracy members of the council paid a silent tribute to late leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Zhao Ziyang, against the Rules of Procedure, the president of the council suspended the meeting. When the meeting was recalled, pro-Beijing members refused to return to the chamber, forcing the meeting to be adjourned.

On 27 January 2010, when five pro-democracy members were intending to make their resignation speeches, pro-Beijing members of the council left the chamber as a sign of protest. One of the pro-Beijing members nevertheless stayed in the chamber to call for the quorum to be counted, effectively forcing the meeting to be adjourned. The resignation was intended as a &quot;de facto&quot; referendum across all five geographical constituencies of the territory, involving the entire electorate, which would not be officially recognised anyway. Most other factions, although against the move by these five Members, stayed in the chamber.

On 2 May 2012, when the LegCo was debating a law change to bar resigning legislators to participate in by-elections in 6 months, effectively discouraging any more &quot;de facto&quot; referendums, some of the five pro-democracy members who resigned constantly issued quorum calls, especially when they were making their resignation speeches intended for 2 years before. In the nine-hour meeting, 23 quorum calls were issued, taking up to 3 hours. When LegCo reconvened on 3 May, it was adjourned for lack of quorum amid a boycott by the pan-democrats. The pro-government members drew a timetable to ensure a quorum, but it failed to prevent another lack of quorum.

On 18 June 2015, when the LegCo was due to vote on a resolution to amend the provisions for the election of the territory&#x27;s Chief Executive, pro-Beijing members left the chamber to force a quorum roll call to make sure that a sick member could be able to rush back to the chamber. However some of the members stayed behind, citing miscommunication, and the division proceeded with two members above the required quorum of 35. While the resolution was originally predicted to be narrowly defeated due to not able to get super-majority support votes, it turned out to be a landslide defeat.

Quorum-busting and attempts to thwart it are also a common feature during the annual motion debate related to the 1989 Tiananmen massacre moved by pro-democracy Members. The quorum is called to be counted from time to time by the pan-democrats, in order to force the pro-Beijing camp to keep some members in the chamber.

=== India ===
 of the Constitution of India stipulates that at least 10% of total number of members of the House must be present to constitute the quorum to constitute a meeting of either House of Parliament. For example, if the House has the total membership of 250, at least 25 members must be present for the House to proceedings with its business.

If at any time during a meeting of a House there is no quorum, the Chairman has to either adjourn the House or suspend it until there is a quorum.

=== Ireland ===
According to the most recent standing orders, published in 2011, the quorum for the Oireachtas, the Irish parliament, for both the lower House, Dáil Éireann, and the upper House, Seanad Éireann, is 20 members.

The chamber of Dáil Éireann is rarely full outside question time, with often just one government representative (often an ordinary Teachta Dála, not a minister) present to answer opposition questions.
=== Italy ===
Article 64 of the Italian Constitution prescribes that the quorum for both houses of Parliament is an absolute majority of their membership. A quorum is assumed to be present unless 20 members in the Chamber of Deputies or 7 members in the Senate, respectively, request for its presence to be verified.

===New Zealand===

In the New Zealand Parliament there is no general quorum for the House to conduct business. The House&#x27;s previous requirement for a quorum (15 members in a House of 99 members) was abolished in 1996. Some procedures do require minimum participation: a motion without notice to suspend the Standing Orders can be moved only if at least 60 members are present, and a personal vote requires at least 20 participating members.

===Pakistan===
Article 55 of the constitutions of Pakistan states that, if at any time during a sitting of the National Assembly the attention of the person presiding is drawn to the fact that less than one-fourth of the total membership of the Assembly is present, he shall either adjourn the Assembly or suspend the meeting until at least one-fourth of such membership is present, which comprises 87 out of total 342.

===Philippines===
In Congress of the Philippines, half of the membership (13 in the Senate and 159 in the House of Representatives) is needed to muster a quorum. If someone contests the lack of quorum, a roll call shall be done, and if there is indeed less than a majority of members present, the meeting shall be adjourned.

Both majority and minority blocs in Congress have used the lack of quorum in defeating bills that they do not want to be passed without putting it to a vote. After an election during the lame-duck session, quorums are notoriously difficult to muster, more so in the House of Representatives as winning incumbents may opt to go on vacation, and defeated incumbents may opt to not to show up.

===Turkey===

According to article 96 of the Turkish Constitution, unless otherwise stipulated in the Constitution, the Turkish Grand National Assembly shall convene with at least, one-third of the total number of members (184 out of 550) and shall take decisions by an absolute majority of those present; however, the quorum for decisions can, under no circumstances, be less than a quarter plus one of the total
number of members (138 out of 550).

Before the constitutional referendum of 2007, there was a quorum of two-thirds required in the Turkish Parliament: after opposition parties used the quorum to deadlock the presidential election of 2007, making it impossible for the parliament to choose a president, the ruling AK party proposed a referendum to lower the quorum to prevent a repeat of this event. Nearly seventy percent of the participants supported the constitutional changes.

===United Kingdom===
In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the House of Commons has a quorum of 40 MPs, including the Speaker, out of 650 members of the House. There is no need for a quorum to be present at all times: Commons debates could theoretically continue even if only one MP and the Speaker were present.

However, if a division is called and fewer than 40 MPs are present, then a decision on the business being considered is postponed and the House moves on to consider the next item of business.

The quorum for votes on legislation in the House of Lords is 30, but just three of the 753 peers, including the Lord Speaker, are required to be present for a debate to take place.

Historically, the quorum was a select group of the justices of the peace in each county in early modern Britain. In theory, they were men experienced in law, but many of the quorum were appointed because of their status. Some legislation required the involvement of a member of the quorum (e.g., granting a license to a badger). In practice, they increasingly were not qualified, as the proportion in the quorum rose faster than the proportion who were called to the bar or practising lawyers. By 1532, an average 45% of justices of the peace nationally were of the quorum. In Somerset, the proportion rose from 52% in 1562 to 93% in 1636. By then, most of those not on the quorum were new to the bench. Sometimes justices of the peace were removed from the quorum as a disciplinary measure less drastic than removal from the bench.

===United Nations===
The large deliberative bodies of the United Nations (the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council, as well as their subsidiary organs) generally require the attendance of one-third of the membership (currently 65 states in the General Assembly and 18 in ECOSOC) to conduct most business, but a majority of members (currently 97 states in the General Assembly and 28 states in ECOSOC) in order to take any substantive decisions. The rules of the United Nations Security Council make no provisions for quorum, but nine votes are in all cases required to pass any substantive measure, effectively meaning that a meeting with fewer than nine members in attendance is pointless.

===United States===

Article I, Section 5, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution provides that &quot;Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business...&quot;

Therefore, in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, a quorum is a simple majority of their respective members (currently 218 in the House and 51 in the Senate).

The only exceptions are those stated in the Twelfth Amendment:
* In cases where no candidate for President of the United States receives a majority in the Electoral College, the election is decided by the House of Representatives, in which case &quot;a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states&quot; (a possible quorum as low as 34).
* In cases in which no candidate for Vice President of the United States receives a majority in the Electoral College, the election is decided by the Senate, in which case &quot;a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators&quot; (a quorum of 67).

The Senate has the additional ordinary requirement in Rule VI of its Standing Rules that &quot;A quorum shall consist of a majority of the Senators duly chosen and sworn.&quot;

==== Call of the house in the United States Senate ====
In the United States Senate, the procedure was last used in the early morning hours of 25 February 1988.

Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, then the Senate Majority Leader, moved a call of the house after the minority Republicans walked out of the chamber in an attempt to deny the Senate a quorum after Senate aides began bringing cots into the Senate cloakrooms in preparation for an all-night session over campaign finance reform for congressional elections.

Byrd&#x27;s motion was approved 45-3 and arrest warrants were signed for all 46 Republicans: Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Henry K. Giugni and his staff searched the Capitol&#x27;s corridor and Senate office buildings for absent Senators, and after checking several empty offices, spotted Senator Steve Symms of Idaho, who fled down a hallway and escaped arrest. After a cleaning woman gave a tip that Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon was in his office, Giugni opened the door with a skeleton key. Packwood attempted to shove the door closed, but Giugni and two assistants pushed it open. Packwood was subsequently carried feet-first into the Senate chamber by three plainclothes officers and sustained bruised knuckles.
Prior to 1988, the last time the procedure had been used was during a 1942 filibuster over civil rights legislation: Southern Democrat senators had spent days filibustering legislation to end poll taxes, days after the midterm elections had resulted in the Democrats losing of nine seats. Democratic Majority Leader Alben W. Barkley obtained an order on a Saturday session on 14 November 1942, directing Sergeant at Arms Chesley W. Jurney to detain the five Southern absentees to obtain a quorum. Jurney sent his Deputy Sergeant at Arms, J. Mark Trice, to the apartment of Democratic Senator Kenneth McKellar of Tennessee at the Mayflower Hotel. Then 73 years old and the third-most senior Senator, McKellar was later described by Republican Senator Bill Frist in his book on Tennessee senators as an &quot;extraordinarily shrewd man of husky dimensions with a long memory and a short fuse.&quot; Trice called from the lobby, but McKellar refused to answer his phone, so the deputy sergeant-at-arms walked up to the apartment and convinced the senator&#x27;s maid to let him in:


==Quorum-busting==
Quorum-busting, also known as a walkout, is a tactic that prevents a legislative body from attaining a quorum, and can be used by a minority group seeking to block the adoption of some measure they oppose. This generally only happens where the quorum is a super-majority, as quorums of a majority or less of the membership mean that the support of a majority of members is always sufficient for the quorum (as well as for passage). Rules to discourage quorum-busting have been adopted by legislative bodies, such as the call of the house, outlined above.

Quorum-busting has been used for centuries. For instance, in 1840 during his time in the Illinois Legislature, Abraham Lincoln leapt out of a first story window (the doors of the Capitol had been locked to prevent legislators from fleeing) in a failed attempt to prevent a quorum from being present.

===Recent prominent examples===

====Texas (2003, 2021)====
The Texas Constitution requires a 2/3 majority in each chamber of the Texas Legislature for a quorum to be present (unlike the United States Congress, which only requires a simple majority). As such, on several occasions, the minority party has engaged in a walkout so as to prevent a quorum.

During the 2003 Texas redistricting, the majority Republicans in the Texas House of Representatives sought to carry out a controversial mid-decade congressional redistricting bill which would have favored Republicans by displacing five Democratic U.S. Representatives from Texas, nicknamed the &quot;Texas Five&quot;, from their districts. The House Democrats, certain of defeat if a quorum were present, took a plane to the neighboring state of Oklahoma to prevent a quorum from being present (and thus the passage of the bill). The group gained the nickname the &quot;Killer Ds&quot;.

Similarly, the minority Democrats in the Texas Legislature&#x27;s upper chamber, the Texas Senate, fled to New Mexico to prevent a quorum of the Senate to prevent a redistricting bill from being considered during a special session. The group, nicknamed the &quot;Texas Eleven&quot;, stayed in New Mexico for 46 days before John Whitmire returned to Texas, creating a quorum. Because there was now no point in staying in New Mexico, the remaining ten members of the Texas Eleven returned to Texas to vote in opposition to the bill.

Democratic House Representatives in Texas fled the state on the 12th of July 2021 to block the passage of a bill that would change voting rules. At least 51 Democrats – the number needed to break quorum – left the state to Washington D.C. via plane. On 10 August 2021 the House authorised arrest warrants for the legislators breaking quorum. After 38 days quorum was regained when three Democrats, Garnet Coleman, Armando Walle and Ana Hernandez returned, though with Coleman providing quorum from home due to serious illness and Republican Steve Allison isolating in a side room of the chamber due to contracting COVID-19.

====Wisconsin (2011)====
During the 2011 Wisconsin protests, fourteen Democratic members of the Wisconsin Senate went to Illinois in order to bust the necessary 20-member quorum. Democrats in the Indiana House of Representatives did the same in order to block another union-related bill, causing the legislative clock on the bill to expire. Traveling out of their state placed these legislators beyond the jurisdiction of state troopers who could compel them to return to the chamber.

====Oregon (2001, 2019–present)====
In 2001, Democratic members of the House of Representatives staged a five-day walkout over redistricting. Then-Representative Mark Hass participated in the walkout and later noted that although the tactic worked, Democrats &quot;got beaten up pretty hard.&quot;

Beginning in May 2019, Republican state senators in Oregon made a series of walkouts in opposition to an emissions trading bill. On 20 June 2019, Gov. Kate Brown authorized the Oregon State Police to bring back the senators, who had left the Oregon State Capitol to bust the needed quorum. State Sen. Brian Boquist said that he told the state police superintendent to &quot;send bachelors and come heavily armed. I&#x27;m not going to be a political prisoner in the state of Oregon. It&#x27;s just that simple.&quot;

===Disappearing quorum===

The similar tactic of a disappearing quorum—refusing to vote although physically present on the floor or walking out before a vote–was used by the minority to block votes as a filibuster in the United States House of Representatives from 1842 (when a speaking time limit was introduced) until 1890, when Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed ordered that members who were present would count for the purpose of a quorum even if they did not reply to the roll call.
