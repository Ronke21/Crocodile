<text>Gustave Ador (23 December 1845 – 31 March 1928) was a Swiss politician. In 1919, he became President of the Confederation.

==Biography==

===Origins===
Ador was born in Cologny, a municipality of Geneva. He was the grandson of Jean Pierre Ador, an immigrant from Vaud, who obtained his Genevan citizenship in 1814. Ador studied law at the academy (now the university) of Geneva, and in 1868 became a lawyer.

===Early political career===
In 1871, Ador started his political career as a member of the communal council of Cologny, and was twice mayor, in 1878-9 and 1883-5. 
He was a member of the cantonal parliament 1874-6, and continuously from 1878 to 1915 save for a short break in 1902. In 1878-9 he represented Geneva in the Swiss Conseil des États. Then he became a member of the executive of the canton of Geneva, being put in charge of the Department of Justice and Police. He resigned after an unfavourable election in 1880, but once more became a member of the cantonal executive in 1885, and for 12 years had charge of the cantonal finances.

===National Council===
In 1889, he became a member of the Swiss Conseil National (Swiss National Council), and remained so until 1917, being elected President of the Swiss National Council in 1901. He was president of the cantonal executive in 1890, 1892, and 1896. 
In 1894, he became lieutenant-colonel in the Swiss Army. 
Ador served as the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross from 1910 to 1928. In 1914, he founded in Geneva the association for facilitating communications between prisoners of war and the central Geneva agency, and succeeded in giving this enterprise great importance and a widespread extension.

===Federal Council===
After the enforced resignation of Arthur Hoffmann, Ador, in order to soothe the Entente, became a federal councilor (a member of the Federal Executive) on 26 June 1917. He was entrusted with the Department of Foreign Affairs. Towards the end of 1918, he was elected by Parliament to be the Swiss President for 1919, but retired from the Federal Executive at the end of his year of office, on 31 December 1919. 
During his time as councilor, along with being in the Department of Foreign Affairs (1917), he was later in the Department of Home Affairs (1918 - 1919). He was affiliated with the Liberal Party.

===Brussels conference===

In 1920, Ador chaired the Brussels International Financial Conference.

<doc id="240037" wikidata="Q1011478" url="?curid=240037" title="Darlinghurst">
<text>Darlinghurst is an inner-city suburb in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Darlinghurst is located immediately east of the Sydney central business district (CBD) and Hyde Park, within the local government area of the City of Sydney. It is often colloquially referred to as &quot;Darlo&quot;.

Darlinghurst is a densely populated suburb with the majority of residents living in apartments or terraced houses. Once a slum and red-light district, Darlinghurst has undergone urban renewal since the 1980s to become a cosmopolitan area made up of precincts. Places such as Victoria Street (which connects Darlinghurst to Potts Point in the north), Stanley Street (Little Italy) and Crown Street (Vintage and Retro Fashion) are known as culturally rich destinations. These high street areas are connected by a network of lane-ways and street corners with shops, cafes and bars.

Demographically, Darlinghurst is home to the highest percentage of generation X and Y in Australia. The majority of businesses in Darlinghurst are independently owned and operated small businesses with over 50% of all commercial activity in the area being consumer oriented: indie retail, food, drink, dining, leisure and personal services. Darlinghurst is also home to large number of off-street creative industries.

Darlinghurst&#x27;s main street is Oxford Street. This major Sydney road runs east from the south-eastern corner of Hyde Park through Darlinghurst and Paddington and terminates at Bondi Junction. Oxford Street is one of Sydney&#x27;s most famous shopping and dining strips. The Darlinghurst end is well known around the world as the centre of Sydney&#x27;s gay community, is the yearly parade route of the Sydney Mardi Gras and the spiritual birthplace of the LGBTQ rights movement. It is home to a number of prominent gay venues and businesses, while more broadly Darlinghurst is a centre of Sydney&#x27;s burgeoning small bar scene.

From the 1990s onwards, Oxford Street began to garner a reputation for being Sydney&#x27;s primary &quot;nightclub strip&quot;, popular with both gay and straight clubbers, surpassing the notorious red-light district of Kings Cross in popularity. As a result of the influx of revellers, crime rates increased in the area around 2007, particularly for assaults and robberies. This reported increase should be understood in terms of a very low background crime rate in East Sydney in general. The 2014 lockout laws saw many nightclubs close and the crime rate drop once again, with a new focus on small bars, restaurants and cafes after the lockout laws ended in 2020.

There are a number of named localities in and around Darlinghurst including Taylor Square, Three Saints Square, and confusingly also East Sydney. Locals have used this name to refer to the area immediately around Stanley Street in the suburb&#x27;s west, however the title is used more broadly throughout the area from Woolloomooloo up to Taylor Square where the old Darlinghurst Gaol still has the words East Sydney in brass lettering above the main entrance. This is because from 1900 to 1969 the entire area to the east of Sydney&#x27;s CBD, from the harbour to Redfern, was an electorate known as the Division of East Sydney. Already in 1820 the entire ridge line running from Potts Point to Surry Hills was known as Eastern Hill.

Darlinghurst shares a postcode (2010) and an extensive soft southern border with neighbouring suburb Surry Hills which, with Paddington to the east and Woolloomooloo, Rushcutters Bay and Potts Point to the north, comprise the metropolitan region of East Sydney. Although only minutes walk away from the Sydney CBD, this region is geographically distinct from it; separated from the more well known commercial centre by several landmarks: Central railway station, Hyde Park, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral and The Domain. East Sydney hosts many well-known restaurants.

Sydney&#x27;s Eastern Suburbs cover all the land from the east of Darlinghurst up to the Pacific Ocean.

==History==
The area now known as Darlinghurst lies on the traditional lands of Gadigal people. They continued to visit and use the place into the 1840s.

Although close to Sydney, rocky ridges and shallow soil made the area less attractive for the early settlers than other more productive, arable sites and it was not developed by European settlers until the early 19th century. Sandstone was quarried there, originally with convict labour, and it continued to be extracted there into the second half of the nineteenth century, using prisoners from the nearby Darlinghurst Gaol. 

In the 19th century, the prominent ridge of Darlinghurst was the site of windmills that made use of the breezes from Sydney Harbour. In about 1819, Thomas Clarkson, a merchant, erected a windmill, built of stone with a rotating top, near what is now the intersection of Liverpool and Darley streets. Close by, two post mills were built. Thomas Hyndes built a fourth mill, close to Caldwell Street. The last of the mills, which reportedly stood until around 1873, was the Craigend mill. It was near Thomas Mitchell&#x27;s Craigend villa, on the highest point of the ridge, near what is now the top of Beare&#x27;s Stairs in Caldwell Street.

The area was originally known as Eastern Hill and then Henrietta Town, after Governor Lachlan Macquarie&#x27;s wife, whose second name was Henrietta. The loyalties changed with the change of governors and the suburb became Darlinghurst in honour of Eliza Darling, the popular wife of Governor Ralph Darling, during the early 19th century. The suffix &#x27;hurst&#x27; is derived from the Old English word hyrst, meaning wooded area.

The area became fashionable after Governor Ralph Darling, selected the ridge line—from what is now Surrey Street and Tewkesbury Avenue in Darlinghurst, north to the end of Potts Point—as an area for homes of members of the colonial elite. Between 1828 and 1831, Darling made seventeen land grants to wealthy merchants, public servants and private citizens. He imposed stringent conditions on development of the land; all plans required his approval prior to construction, all houses had to be £1000 or more in value, and each piece of land could contain only a single residence and had to have a landscaped garden. Four of the villas were south of what is now William Street, within the Darlinghurst boundary. These were Barham, designed by John Verge for Edward Deas Thomson; Craigend, designed by and built for Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell; Rose Hall, the house of Ambrose Hallen Town Surveyor and Colonial Architect; and Rosebank, likely designed by John Verge and built for Deputy Commissary-General James Laidley. All four villas survived into the twentieth century, but only Barham survives today, within the grounds of the Sydney Church of England Girls&#x27; Grammar School (SCEGGS).

The area became less fashionable once the Darlighurst Gaol opened in 1841. Later, the area became partly industrial. A notable factory was that of Sargent&#x27;s Pies, in Burton Street, which was producing 150,000 pies a week there, by 1913.

The late 19th century saw Darlinghurst become the final days of English-born Australian novelist Ethel Pedley. She died at her home on 6 August 1898 at the age of 39 from complications of cancer whilst writing &quot;Dot and the Kangaroo&quot;, which would be retrospectively published a year later.

In 1973, Darlinghurst saw a green ban as a ban on all commercial construction was placed by the NSW Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) as residents demanded that all housing should be high density low-rise with adequate provision for low and middle income families to live within the inner-city area.

==Landmarks==
Darlinghurst has two of Sydney&#x27;s museums: the Australian Museum (a natural history museum) and the Sydney Jewish Museum. The suburb also features St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, and is associated with the Sacred Heart Hospice on Darlinghurst Road, and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research.

===Darlinghurst Gaol===

Darlinghurst Gaol, the large sandstone penal complex in the middle of Darlinghurst was built between 1836 and 1840. The large sandstone walls still bear convict markings, and the complex features six wings surrounding a circular chapel. Australian poet Henry Lawson spent time incarcerated here during some of the turbulent years of his life. The last hanging at the gaol was in 1907 (Jahn, 1997). The site became East Sydney Technical College in 1921, but was turned into the National Art School from 1995.

===Darlinghurst Fire Station===

Darlinghurst Fire Station was completed in 1912, this three-storey brick and stone building occupies a prominent location at the corner of Darlinghurst Road and Victoria Street. It was designed in 1910 by Walter Liberty Vernon (Jahn, 1997). It still functions as a fire station and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

===Darlinghurst Courthouse===
Darlinghurst Courthouse is an imposing heritage-listed sandstone building on Taylor Square. It was designed by architect Mortimer Lewis in 1844, and has a Greek Revival style facade. The central block is adapted from an 1823 design in Peter Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;The New Practical Builder&quot; (Apperly, Irving &amp; Reynolds, 1989).

===Oxford Street===

Oxford Street is the major commercial thoroughfare of Darlinghurst, running from the south-east corner of Hyde Park, through Taylor Square and beyond into Paddington, Woollahra and Bondi Junction, respectively. Oxford Street was originally called The South Head Road and work commenced on the road in 1811 (Faro, 2000). It was a toll road in its early years with the toll gates being located near present-day Glenmore Road. Oxford Street assumed its current name in 1875. Oxford Square is located at the intersection of Oxford and Burton Streets. Oxford Square is also the name of a small shopping centre located opposite, on the corner of Oxford and Riley Streets. Football Federation Australia have their head office at 1 Oxford Street.

===Stanley Street===

Stanley Street is one of the suburb&#x27;s two secondary restaurant strips (with Victoria Street) and is often referred to as Sydney&#x27;s first &quot;Little Italy&quot;. However, the restaurants range from Japanese, Thai and Italian and the prices range from basic to moderate. There is an annual Italian Festival held here every June.

===Victoria Street===
Victoria Street is the other major cafe strip. Restaurants range from basic to upmarket. The majority of the cafes have outdoor seating. Several iconic restaurants are in this area, such as Tropicana and Bar Coluzzi.

===The Horizon===

The Horizon, located in Forbes Street, Darlinghurst, is a 43-storey residential high-rise building completed in 1998. It has a distinctive scalloped facade and is finished in rendered concrete. The building was designed by Sydney architect Harry Seidler and is controversial in that it was one of the first high-rise buildings constructed in the predominately low rise area, with critics saying it caused overshadowing of the surrounding area. The Horizon apartments consist of a residential tower and two lower buildings of apartments, 6 levels of car parks, swimming pool, a tennis court, gym and surrounding gardens.

==Demographics==

At the , the population of Darlinghurst was 10,615. 57.9% of people were male and 42.1% female. This was a higher rate of male residents than the national average of 49.3%. In Darlinghurst, 52.7% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 6.3%, New Zealand 4.0%, Thailand 2.1%, United States of America 2.0% and China 1.6%. 71.8% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Spanish 2.5%, Thai 2.0%, Mandarin 1.9%, Italian 1.2% and French 1.2%. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 54.3%. Of occupied private dwellings in Darlinghurst, 78.8% were flats or apartments and 19.6% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses, townhouses etc. Just 0.9% of dwellings were separate houses, compared to the national average of 72.2%.

==Commercial area==
Darlinghurst&#x27;s commercial activity is centred on Oxford Street, and extends to Victoria Street, Flinders Street, Crown Street, William Street, and Darlinghurst Road. There are a large number of cafés, restaurants and take-away food stores throughout Darlinghurst, as well as a large number of pubs and nightclubs, many of which are on Oxford Street. These pubs and clubs were subject to controversial &#x27;lock-out&#x27; laws imposed by the Liberal state government in February 2014, in which venues stopped admitting new customers after 01:30, and ceased the service of alcohol between 03:00 and 05:00. These laws were introduced as a response to violence in the Inner City of Sydney that was related to alcohol intoxication. The lockout laws were repealed in January 2020 with a focus on small bars over big nightclubs. There is also a significant retail presence, including fashion retailers.

==Transport==
Darlinghurst is well-served by lots of forms of public transport, with many bus routes from the Eastern Suburbs converging on Oxford Street prior to entering the Sydney central business district. Route 333 between Circular Quay and Bondi Beach travels through Darlinghurst along Oxford Street. Routes 352, 373, 396 and 440 also travel through the suburb on Oxford Street. Buses that travel through the centre of Darlinghurst are routes 311 and 389.

There are no train stations in Darlinghurst, however Kings Cross railway station on the Sydney Trains Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra railway line is just over the northern border of the suburb. Museum station on the City Circle, is located just to the west of Darlinghurst, on the south-west corner of Hyde Park.

==Schools==
Darlinghurst Public School, located on the corner of Liverpool Street and Womerah Avenue, was opened in 1884. It teaches both boys and girl students from Kindergarten to Year 6 grade. Sydney Grammar School is located on College Street, across the road from Hyde Park. This school is a boys-only private school which opened in 1857.

The Sydney Church of England Girls&#x27; Grammar School (now called SCEGGS Darlinghurst) was founded in 1895 in Victoria Street, Darlinghurst. It moved to its current site in Forbes Street, in 1901. The former Marist Brothers High School at 280–296 Liverpool Street is now an apartment complex named Alexandra. The school occupied this site from 1911 until 1968 when it moved to Marist College Canberra.

The National Art School of Australia, a specialist Art school in collaboration with Sydney TAFE, dates back to 1859.

The University of Notre Dame&#x27;s School of Medicine and the School of Nursing are located in the historic parish buildings associated with the Sacred Heart Parish in Darlinghurst. The complex includes facilities for use by medical and nursing students such as simulated wards, practise wet laboratories and clinical skills laboratories in addition to simulated consulting rooms.

==Churches==

Darlinghurst has four functioning churches: 
* God in the city, an Assemblies of God congregation affiliated with Christian City Churches
* St. Pauls Lutheran Church congregation (Sydney Lutheran Parish)
* St John&#x27;s, an Anglican congregation. St John&#x27;s operates Rough Edges, a street outreach centre that functions as a cafe and drop-in centre. It provides a range of services to the local community, including the homeless.
* Sacred Heart Catholic Church is on the corner of Darlinghurst Road and Oxford Street.
There are also a number of other religious organisations in the suburb, including a variety of smaller chapels and religious services attached to St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital.

The building which previously housed the Church of Christ, Scientist is now a private residence. There is also the defunct St. Peter&#x27;s Anglican church, Bourke Street, which is now part of SCEGGS Darlinghurst.

==Politics==
The area has often been a battleground between the two councils of the City of Sydney and the City of South Sydney. Most of the suburb belonged to South Sydney, however the New South Wales State Government moved the borders repeatedly in order to change the make-up of the City of Sydney. Many claim that these shifts have been attempted to shift the balance of power in the favour of the party in control of the State Government, though some residents of Darlinghurst and Potts Point (the former North Ward of the City of South Sydney) felt that the postcodes of 2010 (Darlinghurst and Surry Hills) and 2011 (Elizabeth Bay, Kings Cross, Rushcutters Bay, Woolloomooloo and Potts Point) were relatively neglected by the City of South Sydney.

However, this battle is now moot since both councils were forced by the State Government to amalgamate in February 2004. An election was held on Saturday, 27 March 2004, in order to elect a new council for the redesignated (expanded) City of Sydney.
Critics of the amalgamation have claimed that the election demonstrated strong voter backlash against the State Government for pressing the issue. The Australian Labor Party, for whom the area was usually safe, had their primary vote reduced to approximately 20%. The independent Clover Moore took the Lord Mayoral position, having campaigned against the Government&#x27;s dismissal of the council.

At a federal level, Darlinghurst falls in the electorates of the Division of Sydney and Wentworth. Its current parliamentary representatives are Tanya Plibersek (Labor) and Allegra Spender (Independent). These electorates have some of the state&#x27;s strongest support for The Greens.

==Culture==

The Darlinghurst area is famous for the annual Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. The parade, first held in 1978 as a protest march by members of the gay and lesbian community, marks the end of a three-week festival and takes place on Oxford Street, the main street that runs through several suburbs, including Darlinghurst. 

The Sydney Jewish Museum is on the corner of Darlinghurst Road and Burton Street (148 Darlinghurst Rd) and features exhibitions about the Jewish community in Sydney.

There are many small private art galleries in Darlinghurst, including Black Eye Gallery (Darlinghurst Road; photography), King Street Gallery on William (William Street; painting), Conny Dietzschold Gallery (Crown Street; contemporary art), Stanley Street Gallery (Stanley Street; contemporary art), Robin Gibson (Liverpool Street; painting, sculpture), Gallery 9 (Darley Street; contemporary art) and Liverpool Street Gallery (Liverpool Street; contemporary art).

There is also a gallery in the National Art School that hosts exhibitions in a mid-19th century sandstone building.

The Watters Gallery in Riley Street was a longstanding institution run by Frank Watters and his associates Geoffrey and Alex Legge, finally closing its doors in November 2018.

The Eternity Playhouse in Burton Street Darlinghurst opened in 2013, following the renovation of the former Burton Street Tabernacle, which was founded in 1887. Following its purchase by the City of Sydney in 2004, plans were gradually developed to renovate the building as a theatre.

<text>The Wharton School ( ) is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania, a private Ivy League research university in Philadelphia. Established in 1881 through a donation from Joseph Wharton, a co-founder of Bethlehem Steel, the Wharton School is the world&#x27;s oldest collegiate business school. It is one of six Ivy League Business Schools and a member of the M7, an informal network of business schools regarded as among the most prestigious in the United States. The Wharton School is the business school which has produced the highest number of billionaires in the US.

The Wharton School awards undergraduate and graduate degrees with a school-specific economics major and concentrations in over 18 disciplines in Wharton&#x27;s academic departments. The undergraduate degree is a general business degree focused on core business skills. At the graduate level, the Master of Business Administration program can be pursued by itself or along with dual studies leading to a joint degree from its law, engineering, and government schools. 

In addition to its tracks in accounting, finance, operations, statistics, and other academic departments, the doctoral and post-doctoral programs co-sponsor several diploma programs in conjunction with other schools within the university.

== History ==
=== Founding===

Joseph Wharton, a native Philadelphian, was a leader in industrial metallurgy who built his fortune through the American Nickel Company and Bethlehem Steel Corporation. As Wharton&#x27;s business grew, he recognized that business knowledge in the United States was only taught through an apprenticeship system, and such a system was not viable for creating a wider economy during the Second Industrial Revolution. 

After two years of planning, Wharton in 1881 founded the Wharton School of Finance and Economy through a $100,000 initial pledge, making it the first business school established in the United States. ESCP Europe, established in 1819, and a few other business schools were established in Europe prior to Wharton&#x27;s founding The school was meant to train future leaders to conduct corporations and public organizations in a rapidly evolving industrial era. Wharton was quoted as saying that the school was meant to &quot;instill a sense of the coming strife [in business life]: of the immense swings upward or downward that await the competent or the incompetent soldier in this modern strife.&quot;

From the founding of the school, he defined that its goal was &quot;to provide for young men special means of training and of correct instruction in the knowledge and in the arts of modern Finance and Economy, both public and private, in order that, being well informed and free from delusions upon these important subjects, they may either serve the community skillfully as well as faithfully in offices of trust, or, remaining in private life, may prudently manage their own affairs and aid in maintaining sound financial morality: in short, to establish means for imparting a liberal education in all matters concerning Finance and Economy.&quot; The school was renamed the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, in 1902, and formally changed its name to simply Wharton School in 1972.

=== Development ===
Early on, the Wharton School faculty was tightly connected to an influential group of businessmen, bankers, and lawyers that made up the larger Philadelphia School of Political Economy. The faculty incorporated social sciences into the Wharton curriculum, as the field of business was still under development. Albert S. Bolles, a lawyer, served as Wharton&#x27;s first professor, and the school&#x27;s Industrial Research Unit was established in 1921.

Wharton professor Simon Kuznets, who later won the Nobel Prize in Economics, created statistical data on national output, prices, investment, and capital stock and measured seasonability, cycles, and secular trends of these phenomena. His work laid out what became the standard procedure for measuring the gross national product and the gross domestic product, and he later led an international effort to establish the same statistical information for all national economies. Professor Lawrence Klein, who also won the Nobel Prize in Economics, developed the first econometric model of the U.S. economy, which combined economic theory with mathematics, providing another way to test theories and predict future economic trends.

Wharton professor George W. Taylor is credited with founding the academic field of study known as industrial relations. He served in several capacities in the federal government, most notably as a mediator and arbitrator. During his career, Taylor settled more than 2,000 strikes. In 1967, he helped draft the New York State civil service law that legalized collective bargaining in the state but that also banned strikes by public employees—legislation widely known today as the Taylor Law.

Wharton professor Wroe Alderson (1898–1964) is widely recognized as the most important marketing theorist of the twentieth century and the &quot;father of modern marketing.&quot; Wharton professor Paul Green is considered to be the &quot;father of conjoint analysis&quot; for his discovery of the statistical tool for quantification of market research.

Wharton professor Solomon S. Huebner is known widely as &quot;the father of insurance education.&quot; He originated the concept of &quot;human life value,&quot; which became a standard method of calculating insurance value and need. He established the goal of professionalism in the field of insurance, developed the first collegiate-level program in insurance and chaired the Department of Insurance at Wharton, and contributed greatly to the progress of adult education in this area. Wharton professor Daniel M. McGill was widely regarded as the &quot;dean of the pension industry,&quot; whose research contributed to shaping the modern retirement system both in the public and corporate sectors.

In 1946, after ENIAC was created at the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton created the first multidisciplinary programs in technology management with the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Wharton faculty began to work closely with AT&amp;T, Merrill Lynch, MasterCard, Prudential Insurance, and the New York Stock Exchange in analyzing the strategic and commercial implications of information systems.

The Wharton School&#x27;s first business professor was an attorney, Albert Bolles. At the time, there were no other business schools, and no business professors could be recruited elsewhere. Bolles, a lawyer by education and training, and business journalist by career seemed to be the best option for Joseph Wharton. Bolles started his career as a lawyer in Connecticut in the second half of the 19th century. After resigning from his law firm, he started pursuing a new career in business journalism and was promoted to the editor role of &quot;Bankers Magazine&quot;, a trade publication, in 1880. Upon joining the Wharton School, he began teaching business with classes on the law of governing finance and on the processes of commercial banking. Bolles&#x27; instruction in finance was influenced by his previous experience in &quot;Bankers Magazine&quot;: he stressed conservative business practices, drawing on business history as much as he could. In his classes, inflationist Congressmen were &quot;self-interested debtors.&quot; Besides teaching, Bolles advocated for several national reforms, including the uniform banking law. Wharton historian Steven A. Sass wrote about him, &quot;Bolles thus fulfilled Joseph Wharton&#x27;s pedagogic expectations and…got the new school off to a respectable start by the spring of 1883.&quot; In 1884, the first five business students were awarded a Bachelor of Finance degree. One graduate, Shiro Shiba, returned to Japan where he would become a member of the Diet, the Japanese parliament, and another, Robert Adams Jr., later was named United States Ambassador to Brazil.

Classes in business and finance abounded at the Wharton School, but it lacked in any other areas of business interest. Edmund J. James, with a doctorate from the University of Halle in Germany, reinvigorated the school&#x27;s curriculum, starting classes on political finance and administration. Later in 1885, James argued for redesigning the course of study at Wharton with elements of German higher education. He wanted to include training in banking, railroading, merchandising, manufacturing, and other similar branches, and expand the course&#x27;s length to four years from the initial three. Joseph Wharton in November 1893 pledged an additional $75,000 to the school in order to implement James&#x27; ideas in the school&#x27;s curriculum. A more comprehensive study plan was then rolled out. Between 1895 and 1915, James started teaching at Wharton the new fields of finance and management as they were developing in the business world. The Wharton School improved its reputation from a bunch of academic &quot;misfits,&quot; and some of its alumni rose in the U.S. business world. During this period, the school continued to attract additional faculty members and expand its research programs.

Wharton began awarding MBA degrees in 1921. The first woman to earn an MBA at Wharton was Alma K. Ledig, in 1931. In 1942, during World War II, in the same fashion of other schools, Wharton&#x27;s full-time faculty dropped dramatically from 165 to 39 by 1944. According to school historians, members of the faculty were called upon for special posts. In 1959, Wharton adopted the curriculum that is now taught in most major business schools: the program was changed with liberal arts education doubling to almost half of the curriculum. In 1974 the social sciences department, along with the rest of the university&#x27;s liberal arts programs, was moved to the newly created University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences. Since then, Wharton faculty have focused exclusively on various aspects of business education.

Official historical names of the institution include the Wharton School of Finance and Economy, from 1881 to 1901, and the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, from 1902 to 1971.

The Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at Wharton was permanently endowed by alumnus Jay H. Baker in 2010. It is an interdisciplinary industry research center which was originally established in 2002. The center brings together retail leaders, faculty, and students to discuss the opportunities and challenges of retailers. The Baker Retailing Center also hosts an annual CEO Summit in New York City.

On February 26, 2020, Erika H. James was named dean of the Wharton School, effective July 1, 2020. She is both the first woman and the first African-American to lead the business school.

== Campus ==
=== Philadelphia campus ===

The Philadelphia campus of the Wharton School has four primary buildings, Jon M. Huntsman Hall, Steinberg Hall-Dietrich Hall, Vance Hall, and Lauder-Fischer Hall. In addition, the Steinberg Conference Center houses the Aresty Institute of Executive Education.

Jon M. Huntsman Hall is the Wharton School&#x27;s main building. The building is a 324,000-square-foot structure with 48 seminar and lecture halls, 57 group study rooms, and several auditoriums and conference rooms. It was constructed through a donation from Wharton alumnus Jon M. Huntsman. It also has a 4,000-square-foot forum, as well as a colloquium space on the top floor.

Steinberg Hall-Dietrich Hall is a joint 180,000-square-foot structure comprising two adjacent halls. It was built in 1952 and expanded in 1983 through a donation from Wharton alumnus Saul Steinberg, and houses the offices of several academic departments at the Wharton School. It also contains lecture halls, conference rooms and common areas for faculty and students.

Vance Hall is a 107,000-square-foot structure built in 1972 to house Wharton&#x27;s graduate programs, administrative offices, lecture halls, and meeting areas.

Lauder-Fischer Hall houses the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and focuses mainly on international business teaching and research initiatives. The Lauder Institute was founded in 1983 by Wharton alumni Leonard Lauder and Ronald Lauder.

In 2014, the Wharton School launched the Student Life Space in Philadelphia&#x27;s central business district. It is a 20,000-square-foot space with conference rooms, meeting rooms and over 20 group study rooms. It also serves as an incubator space for startup companies.

In 2018, it was announced that a new 70,000-square-foot campus building for student entrepreneurship would be constructed, following a $25 million donation from the hedge fund manager and philanthropist Nicolai Tangen. The building will be located at 40th and Sansom Streets, and is set to be completed by 2020.

=== San Francisco campus ===

In 2001, Wharton launched a satellite campus in San Francisco, California. The Bay Area campus was created to capitalize on the growing start-up culture and related financing sector of Silicon Valley. It serves as a hub on the West Coast for its students and alumni. As of 2012, the campus is open to executive MBA students and to full-time MBA students, who can decide to spend the spring semester of first year, or fall or spring semesters of second year of the MBA program in San Francisco in the Semester in San Francisco Program. For the full-time MBAs, the Semester in San Francisco Program focuses on entrepreneurship, technology, and venture capital.

== Undergraduate program ==
=== Admissions process ===

Prospective Wharton candidates apply in their senior year of high school either through the early decision (ED) process or regular decision (RD) process. Unlike many other undergraduate business programs where students transfer in after their freshman or second year (University of Virginia&#x27;s McIntire, Emory&#x27;s Goizueta), Wharton applicants apply specifically for Wharton during their senior year of high school. These candidates are then grouped with a pool of applicants separate from those applying to the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), or School of Nursing. Each of the other three schools also forms its own separate pool of applicants.

The legacy status of applicants, defined as having a parent or another direct relative who attended the same academic institution, may be considered in the admissions process. This correlation has been observed in a number of empirical studies conducted on the nation&#x27;s most elite schools, with a particular focus on Ivy League universities. Leading universities in the United States cite stronger alumni connections and continued support as the primary reasons for this practice.

=== Graduation and employment ===

Wharton undergraduate students are required to graduate with a B.S. in economics with at least 1 of 21 current concentrations. Concentrations range from finance and accounting to lesser-known studies such as business analytics and Social Impact &amp; Responsibility. Obtaining a concentration requires a student to take four classes outside of what is required in the core curriculum. Policy has recently changed such that Wharton students can graduate with a maximum of 2 concentrations rather than 3. 
In the 2015–16 school year, 334 employers participated in the on-campus recruiting process; each student received an average of 7.6 first-round interviews and 1.8 job offers. About 48% of Wharton&#x27;s typical undergraduate class of 650 students go into financial services, with the top sectors being investment banking, investment management, and private equity. The next most common industry after finance is management consulting, which hires approximately 22% of the students, while a significant number of students enter marketing, sales, and the technology industry, particularly in Silicon Valley.

For the Class of 2020, Wharton undergraduate students reported a median first-year base compensation of $86,217.

== Graduate programs ==
=== MBA program ===

The school offers two paths, an MBA for full-time students and an MBA for executives. Students can elect to pursue double majors or individualized majors. During their first year, all students pursue a required core curriculum that covers traditional management disciplines—finance, marketing, statistics, and strategy—as well as the leadership, ethics, and communication skills needed at senior levels of management. Students pick electives in the second year.

Wharton MBA students may pursue a dual degree with the Lauder Institute, Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, or with one of the graduate schools at the University of Pennsylvania.

MBA students from the Class of 2021 earn an average first-year salary and guaranteed compensation of $155,000. Additionally, the class reported a median sign-on bonus of $30,000 and a median guaranteed bonus of $28,204. The MBA program annually receives around 7,300 applications for the 850 places in the class.

Wharton co-sponsored the Executive Master&#x27;s in Technology Management Program (EMTM) with the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science. Graduates received a Master of Science in engineering (MSE) in the management of technology from the School of Engineering and Applied Science. The EMTM program ended in August 2014.

Wharton is also part of the Wharton-INSEAD Alliance. MBA students from each program can spend one period of study at the partner school, allowing Wharton students access to the INSEAD campuses in both Fontainebleau and Singapore. Students who are interested in careers in technology industries also regularly study at Wharton&#x27;s San Francisco campus.

=== Doctoral programs ===
Wharton offers doctor of philosophy degrees in finance, applied economics, management, and other business fields (as opposed to some schools, which grant DBAs).
It takes approximately four to six years to complete the doctoral program. Wharton also offers a dual master&#x27;s degree in statistics and data science for students enrolled in other doctoral programs at the university. 

Students who are interested in careers in technology industries also regularly study at Wharton&#x27;s San Francisco campus.

== Executive Education ==
The Wharton School pioneered so-called &#x27;executive education&#x27; (open-admissions course enrichment for professionals) and operates the Aresty Institute of Executive Education, commonly known as &quot;Wharton Executive Education&quot;, a center for continuing business education for senior executives. The institute is named in honor of civic leader, business owner, philanthropist, and Wharton alumnus Julian Aresty and his brother Joseph Aresty, who together endowed the Aresty Institute for Executive Education in 1987.
Wharton Executive Education offers programs for executives in areas such as finance, marketing, strategy, and innovation. Each year, more than 10,000 professionals worldwide attend Wharton Executive Education programs in classes taught by full-time Wharton faculty.
Wharton offers more than 50 open enrollment programs for individuals on campuses in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Beijing, China. Wharton also overs three long-duration open-enrollment programs that confer alumni status upon successful completion. These programs are the Advanced Finance Program, Advanced Management Program, and the General Management Program. Some programs eligible for alumni status, Wharton Programs for Working Professionals (WPWP), for example, are not offered anymore. However, graduates of these programs are still qualified for &quot;Alumni, Non-Degreed&quot; status by Penn.
In addition to a large portfolio of open-enrollment programs for individuals, Wharton Executive Education also offers customized programs for organizations. Custom program topic areas include Finance and Value Creation, Leadership Development, Marketing and Sales, and Strategy and Innovation. Industry areas of expertise include Consumer Products, Retail, Energy, Transportation, Financial Services, Health Care, Pharmaceuticals, Manufacturing and Industrials, Professional Services, Technology and Communications.

== Wharton Online ==
Through its online division, Wharton offers massive open online courses on Coursera with specializations in business and financial modeling, business analytics, entrepreneurship, FinTech and business foundations. Wharton Online also offers a Leadership and Management Certificate and a Business Analytics Certificate. The division is accredited by the International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET); it was the first online business school to be accredited by this organization.

The COVID-19 pandemic meant a rapid shift towards online teaching, transforming some of the classroom courses into online courses. For years there has been a strong investment in online education, so the school has been able to adapt well to the new circumstances, according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; analysis on the adaptation of business schools to COVID-19.

== Notable people ==
=== Alumni ===

Wharton School alumni include Tesla/SpaceX/Twitter CEO Elon Musk, U.S. president Donald Trump, investor Warren Buffett and financier Marc Rowan. Other alumni include the current and former CEOs of Fortune 500 at Alphabet Inc., Boeing, Comcast, General Electric, H-E-B, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Oracle, Pfizer, PepsiCo, and other companies.

<text>Butch and femme (; ; ) are masculine (butch) or feminine (femme) identities in the lesbian subculture that have associated traits, behaviors, styles, self-perception, and so on. This concept has been called a &quot;way to organize sexual relationships and gender and sexual identity&quot;. Butch–femme culture is not the sole form of a lesbian dyadic system, as there are many women in butch–butch and femme–femme relationships.

Both the expression of individual lesbians of butch and femme identities and the relationship of the lesbian community in general to the notion of butch and femme as an organizing principle for sexual relations varied over the course of the 20th century. Some lesbian feminists have argued that butch–femme is a replication of heterosexual relations, while other commentators argue that, while it resonates with heterosexual patterns of relating, butch–femme simultaneously challenges it. Research in the 1990s in the United States showed that &quot;95% of lesbians are familiar with butch/femme codes and can rate themselves or others in terms of those codes, and yet the same percentage feels that butch/femme was &#x27;unimportant in their lives.

==Etymology and symbology==
The word &quot;femme&quot; is taken from the French word for woman. The word &quot;butch&quot;, meaning &quot;masculine&quot;, may have been coined by abbreviating the word &quot;butcher&quot;, as first noted in George Cassidy&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot;. However, the exact origin of the word is still unknown.

Butch artist Daddy Rhon Drinkwater created a symbol of a black triangle intersecting a red circle to represent butch/femme &quot;passion and love&quot;. The symbol was first used on their website &quot;Butch-Femme.com&quot; (the website is now defunct).

==Attributes==
There is debate about to whom the terms butch and femme can apply, and particularly whether transgender individuals can be identified in this way. For example, Jack Halberstam argues that transgender men cannot be considered butch, since it constitutes a conflation of maleness with butchness. Halberstam further argues that butch–femme is uniquely geared to work in lesbian relationships. Stereotypes and definitions of butch and femme vary greatly, even within tight-knit LGBTQ communities. Jewelle Gomez mused that butch and femme women in the earlier twentieth century may have been expressing their closeted transgender identity. Antipathy toward female butches and male femmes has been interpreted by some commentators as transphobia, although female butches and male femmes are not always transgender, and indeed some heterosexuals of both genders display these attributes.

Scholars such as Judith Butler and Anne Fausto-Sterling suggest that butch and femme are not attempts to take up &quot;traditional&quot; gender roles. Instead, they argue that gender is socially and historically constructed, rather than essential, &quot;natural&quot;, or biological. The femme lesbian historian Joan Nestle argues that femme and butch may be seen as distinct genders in and of themselves.

===Butch===
&quot;Butch&quot; can be used as an adjective or a noun to describe an individual&#x27;s gender performance. The term butch tends to denote a degree of masculinity displayed by a female individual beyond what would be considered typical of a tomboy. It is not uncommon for women with a butch appearance to face harassment or violence. A 1990s survey of butches showed that 50% were primarily attracted to femmes, while 25% reported being usually attracted to other butches. Feminist scholar Sally Rowena Munt described butches as &quot;the recognizable public form of lesbianism&quot; and an outlaw figure within lesbian culture. In the novel &quot;Stone Butch Blues&quot;, author Leslie Feinberg explored the working-class roots in America and the concept of transmasculine and stone butches. A stone butch is a &quot;top&quot; who does not want to be touched during sex.

BUTCH Voices, a national conference for &quot;individuals who are masculine of center,&quot; including gender variant, was founded in 2008.

===Femme===
Like the term &quot;butch,&quot; femme can be used as an adjective or a noun. Femmes are not &quot;read&quot; as lesbians unless they are with a butch partner, because they conform to traditional standards of femininity. Because they do not express masculine qualities, femmes were particularly vexing to sexologists and psychoanalysts who wanted to argue that all lesbians wished to be men. Traditionally, the femme in a butch–femme couple was expected to act as a stereotypical feminine woman and provide emotional support for her butch partner. In the first half of the twentieth century, when butch–femme gender roles were constrained to the underground bar scene, femmes were considered invisible without a butch partnerthat is, they could pass as straight because of their gender conformity. However, Joan Nestle asserts that femmes in a butch–femme couple make both the butch and the femme exceedingly visible. By daring to be publicly attracted to butch women, femmes reflected their own sexual difference and made the butch a known subject of desire.

The separatist feminist movement of the late 1960s and 1970s forced butches and femmes underground, as radical lesbian feminists found lesbian gender roles to be a disappointing and oppressive replication of heterosexual lifestyle. However, the 1980s saw a resurgence of butch and femme gender roles. In this new configuration of butch and femme, it was acceptable, even desirable, to have femme–femme sexual and romantic pairings. Femmes gained value as their own lesbian gender, making it possible to exist separately from butches. For example, Susie Bright, the founder of &quot;On Our Backs&quot;, the first lesbian sex periodical of its kind, identifies as femme. Beyond depictions in pornography, the neo-butch and neo-femme aesthetic in day-to-day life helped add a sense of visual identity to lesbians who had abandoned these roles in the name of political correctness.

In &quot;Negotiating Dyke Femininity,&quot; lesbian scholar Wendy Somerson explains that women in the lesbian community who are more feminine and do not fit into the &quot;butch&quot; stereotype can pass as straight. She believes the link between appearance and gender performance and one&#x27;s sexuality should be disrupted, because the way someone looks should not define their sexuality. In her article, Somerson also clearly talks about how within the lesbian community some are considered more masculine than others.

Femmes still combat the invisibility their presentation creates and assert their sexuality through their femininity. The dismissal of femmes as illegitimate or invisible also happens within the LGBT community itself, which creates the push for femmes to self-advocate as an empowered identity not inherently tied to butches.

===Other terms===
The term &quot;kiki&quot; came into existence in the 1940s to describe a lesbian who did not identify as either butch or femme, and was used disparagingly.

Labels have been tailored to be more descriptive of an individual&#x27;s characteristics, such as &quot;hard butch,&quot; &quot;gym queen,&quot; &quot;tomboy femme,&quot; and &quot;soft stud.&quot; &quot;Lipstick lesbians&quot; are feminine lesbians. A butch woman may be described as a &quot;dyke,&quot; &quot;stone butch,&quot; &quot;diesel dyke,&quot; &quot;bulldyke,&quot; &quot;bull bitch,&quot; or &quot;bulldagger.&quot; A woman who likes to receive and not give sexually is called a &quot;pillow queen,&quot; or a &quot;pillow princess.&quot;

A &quot;stud&quot; is a dominant lesbian in the LGBT community. The term originated with construction and animal breeding, before being associated with promiscuous or attractive men. The word made its way into AAVE through jive in the 1940s. The African-American lesbian community then adopted the word, meaning &quot;masculine African-American lesbian.&quot; Studs tend to be influenced by urban and hip-hop cultures. In the New York City lesbian community, a butch may identify herself as AG (aggressive) or as a stud. In 2005, filmmaker Daniel Peddle chronicled the lives of AGs in his documentary &quot;The Aggressives&quot;, following six women who went to lengths like binding their breasts to pass as men. But Peddle says that today, very young lesbians of color in New York are creating a new, insular scene that is largely cut off from the rest of the gay and lesbian community: &quot;A lot of it has to do with this kind of pressure to articulate and express your masculinity within the confines of the hip-hop paradigm.&quot; Black lesbian filmmaker Dee Rees represented the AG culture in her 2011 film &quot;Pariah&quot;.

There is also an emerging usage of the terms soft butch, &quot;stem&quot; (stud-femme), &quot;futch&quot; (feminine butch), or &quot;chapstick lesbian&quot; as terms for women who have characteristics of both butch and femme. Lesbians who are neither butch nor femme are called &quot;androgynous&quot; or &quot;andros.&quot; The term boi is typically used by younger LGBT women. Defining the difference between a butch and a boi, one boi told a reporter: &quot;that sense of play – that&#x27;s a big difference from being a butch. To me, butch is like an adult...You&#x27;re the man of the house.&quot; Comedian Elvira Kurt contributed the term &quot;fellagirly&quot; as a description for LGBT women who are not strictly either femme or butch, but a combination.

Those who identify as butch and femme today often use the words to define their presentation and gender identity rather than strictly the role they play in a relationship, and in a departure from the historic norm, not all butches are attracted exclusively to femmes and not all femmes are exclusively attracted to butches. Besides the terms &quot;butch&quot; and &quot;femme,&quot; there are a number of other terms used to describe the dress codes, the sexual behaviours, and/or the gender identities of the sexual subcultures who use them. The meanings of these terms vary and can evolve over time.

Some members of the lesbian community eschew butch or femme classifications, believing that they are inadequate to describe an individual, or that labels are limiting in and of themselves.

==History==
Prior to the middle of the 20th century in Western culture, homosexual societies were mostly underground or secret, making it difficult to determine how long butch and femme roles have been practiced by women.

===Early 20th century===
It is known that butch–femme dress codes date back at least to the beginning of the 20th century as photographs from 1900–1920 exist of butch–femme couples in the United States; they were at the time called &quot;transvestites&quot;. However, according to the &quot;Routledge International Encyclopaedia of Women&quot;, although upper-class women like Radclyffe Hall and her lover Una Troubridge lived together in unions that resembled butch–femme relationships, &quot;The term butch/femme would have been categorically inconsequential, however, and incomprehensible to these women.&quot;

===Mid- to late 20th century===
Butch and femme lesbian labels were only starting to become apparent in the 1940s, since it started to become common to allow women to enter bars without men. In the 1940s in the U.S., most butch women had to wear conventionally feminine dress in order to hold down jobs, donning their starched shirts and ties only on weekends to go to bars or parties as &quot;Saturday night&quot; butches. Butches had to take a subtle approach to butchness in order to exist in society. They created outfits that were outwardly accepted by society, but allowed those who were butch to still present as more masculine than the norm- Alix Genter states that &quot;butches wore long, pleated skirts with their man-tailored shirts, sometimes with a vest or coat on top&quot; at Bay Ridge High school.

The 1950s saw the rise of a new generation of butches who refused to live double lives and wore butch attire full-time, or as close to full-time as possible. This usually limited them to a few jobs, such as factory work and cab driving, that had no dress codes for women. Their increased visibility, combined with the anti-gay politics of the McCarthy era, led to an increase in violent attacks on gay and bisexual women, while at the same time the increasingly strong and defiant bar culture became more willing to respond with force. Although femmes also fought back, it became primarily the role of butches to defend against attacks and hold the bars as gay women&#x27;s space. While in the &#x27;40s, the prevailing butch image was severe but gentle, it became increasingly tough and aggressive as violent confrontation became a fact of life. In 1992, a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; anthology about the butch–femme socialization that took place in working class bars of the 40s and 50s was published—&quot;The Persistent Desire: A Femme–Butch Reader&quot;, edited by femme Joan Nestle.

Although butch–femme was not the only organizing principle among lesbians in the mid-20th century, it was particularly prominent in the working-class lesbian bar culture of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, where butch–femme was the norm, while butch–butch and femme–femme relationships were taboo. Those who switched roles were called &quot;ki-ki&quot;, a pejorative term, and they were often the butt of jokes. In the 1950s, in an early piece of lesbian studies, the gay rights campaigning organisation ONE, Inc. assigned Stella Rush to study &quot;the butch/femme phenomenon&quot; in gay bars. Rush reported that women held strong opinions, that &quot;role distinctions needed to be sharply drawn,&quot; and that not being one or the other earned strong disapproval from both groups. It has been noted that, at least in part, kiki women were unwelcome where lesbians gathered because their apparent lack of understanding of the butch–femme dress code might indicate that they were policewomen.

In contrast to ONE, Inc. studies, more conservative homophile organizations of the 1950s, such as the Daughters of Bilitis, discouraged butch–femme roles and identities. This was especially true in relation to the butch identity, as the organization held the belief that assimilation into heterosexual society was the goal of the homophile movement. Gender expressions outside of the norm prevented assimilation.

In the 1970s, the development of lesbian feminism pushed butch–femme roles out of popularity. Lesbian separatists such as Sheila Jeffreys argued that all forms of masculinity, including masculine butch women, were negative and harmful to women. The group of radical lesbians often credited with sparking lesbian feminism, Radicalesbians, called butch culture &quot;male-identified role-playing among lesbians&quot;. This encouraged the emergence of androgyny in lesbian feminist circles, with many women wearing clothing like T-shirts, jeans, flannels, and boots. This dress was very similar to butch dress, weakening a key identifier of butch lesbians.

While butch–femme roles had previously been the primary way of identifying lesbians and quantifying lesbian relationships in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, lesbian feminist ideology had turned these roles into a &quot;perversion of lesbian identity&quot;. Lesbian feminism was publicly represented though white feminism, and often excluded and alienated working class lesbians and lesbians of color. In these excluded communities, butch–femme roles persisted and grew throughout the 1970s. Despite the criticism from both middle-class lesbians and lesbian feminists, butch and femme roles reemerged in the 1980s and 1990s, but were no longer relegated to only working-class lesbians.

===21st century===

In the 21st century, some writers and commentators began to describe a phenomenon in the lesbian community called &quot;The Disappearing Butch&quot;. Some felt butches were disappearing because it had become easier for masculine women who might have previously identified as butch to have sex reassignment surgery and live as men. Others claimed the Disappearing Butch was the result of lesbian &#x27;commodification&#x27; in the media, influenced by the viewing public&#x27;s desire to see lesbians as &quot;reproductions of Hollywood straight women&quot;. One writer noted that in the increased drive for LGBT &#x27;normalization&#x27; and political acceptance, butch lesbians and effeminate gay men seemed to be disappearing. In the 21st century, some younger people were also beginning to eschew labels like &#x27;butch&#x27; or even &#x27;lesbian&#x27; and identify instead as queer.&#x27;

However, others noted that butch women have gained increased visibility in the media, mentioning Ellen DeGeneres, frequently referred to as &#x27;a soft butch&#x27;, political commentator Rachel Maddow, once described as a &#x27;butch fatale&#x27; and the character Big Boo in &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, played by butch comic and actress Lea de Laria.

The 21st century also saw a re-examination of the meaning of &#x27;femme&#x27;, with the term being used in a broader and more politically charged way, particularly by women of color, and some critics challenging what is seen as its appropriation by heteronormative culture.

<doc id="240049" wikidata="Q5509356" url="?curid=240049" title="Funny Car">
<text>A funny car is a type of drag racing vehicle and a specific racing class in organized drag racing. Funny cars are characterized by having tilt-up fiberglass or carbon fiber automotive bodies over a custom-fabricated chassis, giving them an appearance vaguely approximating manufacturers&#x27; showroom models. They also have the engine placed in front of the driver, as opposed to dragsters, which place it behind the driver.

Funny car bodies typically reflect the models of newly available cars in the time period that the funny car was built. For example, in the 1970s, then current models such as the Chevrolet Vega or Plymouth Barracuda were often represented as funny cars, and the bodies represented the Big Three of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Currently, four manufacturers are represented in National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) Funny Car: Chevrolet with the Camaro, Dodge with the Charger, Ford with the Mustang, and Toyota with the Supra. Worldwide, however, many different body styles are used. These &quot;fake&quot; body shells are not just cosmetic; they serve an important aerodynamic purpose.
Modern funny cars can rival or surpass Top Fuel dragsters. 
Today, fielding a Funny Car team can cost between US$2.6 and US$3 million. A single carbon fiber body can cost US$70,000.

==Guidelines==
The NHRA has strict guidelines for Funny Cars. Most of the rules relate to the engine. In short, the engines can only be V8s displacing no more than . The most popular design is a Donovan, loosely based on the second generation Chrysler 426 Hemi.

Crankshafts are CNC machine carved from steel billet, then nitrided in an oven to increase surface hardness. Intake valves are titanium and of diameter, while exhaust valves are diameter, made from Inconel. Every Funny Car has ballistic blankets covering the supercharger because this part of the engine is prone to explosion.

Funny Car fuel systems are key to their immense power. During a single run (starting, burnout, backing up, staging, 1/4 mile) cars can burn as much as of fuel. The fuel mixture is usually 85–90% nitromethane (nitro, &quot;fuel&quot;) and 10–15% methanol (alcohol, &quot;alky&quot;). The ratio of fuel to air can be as high as 1:1. Compression ratios vary from 6:1 to 7:1. The engines in Funny Cars commonly exhibit varying piston heights and ratios that are determined by the piston&#x27;s proximity to the air intake. Funny Cars have a fixed gear ratio of 3.20:1 and have a reversing gear; power is transmitted from engine to final drive through a multiple staged clutch which provides progressive incremental lockup as the run proceeds. The rate/degree of lockup is mechanically/pneumatically controlled and preset before each run according to various conditions, in particular, the track surface. Wheelbases are between . The car must maintain a ground clearance.

Horsepower claims vary widely—from 10,000 to 11,000 HP (7.5–8 MW). Supercharged, nitromethane-fueled motors of this type have a very high torque, estimated at . They routinely achieve a 6-G acceleration from a standing start.

==Safety==
Many safety rules are in place to protect the driver and fans. The more visible safety devices are the twin parachutes to help stabilize and decelerate the car after crossing the finish line. Less visible precautions include roll cages and fire extinguishers.

During safety evaluations in the wake of the fatal crash of Scott Kalitta on June 21, 2008, in Englishtown, N.J., the NHRA reduced the distance of Top Fuel and Funny Car races to 1,000 feet (304 meters) effective July 2, 2008, as later did the National Drag Racing Championship in Australia. Pro Stock and sportsman classes still race to 1⁄4 mile (1,320 feet, 402 meters).

== History ==
In drag racing in the mid-1960s, Top Fuel horsepower began to be combined with bodied cars with altered wheelbases to produce the first &quot;funny cars&quot;. The term &quot;funny car&quot; is attributed to Mercury&#x27;s chief of racing, Fran Hernandez, as in &quot;We need to beat those &#x27;funny&#x27; cars.&quot;

The first funny cars were built in the early to mid-1960s. Funny Car as a class traces its roots to Super Stock, through &quot;the intriguingly named Optional Super Stock class&quot;, to A/Factory Experimental (A/FX), which NHRA introduced in 1962, and ultimately XS (experimental stock).

At the start, the rear tires (&quot;slicks&quot;) were made with a bias-ply construction (&quot;wrinklewall&quot; slicks had not been invented yet), which meant that grip upon launching was poor. Racers who performed these altered wheelbase modifications found it shifted the center of gravity rearward, which placed more weight on the rear wheels, enhancing traction from these bias-ply slicks. Because of these many obvious modifications they did not look stock, hence the name &quot;funny&quot;. The wheelbases were changed to assist traction for the narrow (-wide) slicks (required by NHRA rules), while keeping the mandatory factory distance between axle centers.

The first of the &quot;funny-looking cars&quot; were a trio of 1964 Dodge 330 Max Wedges which were named the &quot;Dodge Chargers&quot;. They debuted in March 1964 at San Diego Raceway. Funny Cars started as stockers, and were, at first, pure exhibition cars, in the Super/Factory Experimental (S/FX) class; NHRA treated them like a passing fad, and tried to &quot;legislate them out of existence&quot; by placing them in first gas and then fuel dragster classes, with cars of half the weight and twice the horsepower.

Funny car success followed the popularity of gassers, the previous favorite doorslammer class. The precursor of the funny car, appearing almost a decade earlier, was John Bandimere&#x27;s blown &#x27;55 Chevy. Funny cars were also preceded by the Modified Sport cars, which had fiberglass bodies, tube frames, and supercharged set-back engines even before Super Stock was conceived.

Among the Modified Sport racers to challenge early funny cars were Roger Hardcastle and Les Beattie with the Stinger, sporting a blown, fuel injected Chrysler hemi in an Astra J-5. In 1964 its 1/4 mile data was 143.85 mph and 10.02 ET. See Hot Rod Magazine from April 1964. Pages 58–60.

The first funny cars were Super Stock 1964 Dodge 330 Max Wedges, named the &quot;Dodge Chargers&quot;, prepared, at the behest of Don Beebe, by Dragmaster&#x27;s Jim Nelson and Dode Martin. Raced in the Supercharged Experimental Stock (S/XS) class, their original 426 Max Wedges were replaced by stroked Top Gas engines (virtual clones of the Top Gas Dodge Dart engines also built by Dragmaster). (Thus, they were technically &quot;funny gassers&quot;, not fuel cars, unlike the later examples.) Despite their fuel limitations, however, they were turning in E.T.s in the high 10s, with speeds around , when Super Stock and FX cars were only running 11s at about , clearly a winning edge. They would also be the first factory cars fitted with parachutes, and the first to see the drivers wear firesuits.

The first major altered-wheelbase car was Dick Landy&#x27;s class-legal SS/A 1964 Dodge 330, which had front and rear axles moved radically forward, a high gasser-style front end and axle, and a 426 hemi. Converted by Landy to A/FX in September 1964, using a straight front axle (from a Dodge A100 van) to reduce weight, then moving the front wheels 6” forward and the 8¾” rear axle 8” forward by relocating the spring hangers. Aluminum parts (including hood, front fenders, radiator shroud, front bumper and supports) replaced steel.

Considered to be the first &#x27;Funny Car&#x27; (it just looked funny at the time). First appearing at the AHRA Winternationals at Phoenix, Arizona, 29–31 January 1964, the combination improved E.T.s from low 11s with speeds in the range to 10.60s at almost . For 1965, Plymouth Belvederes and Dodge Coronets were treated to the altered wheelbase configuration for their factory drivers. Only twelve were built.

The three Chargers, wearing a color scheme of red body sides and white roof, hood, and trunk, with two blue longitudinal stripes, were driven by Jimmy Nix, who previously ran a Top Gas dragster; Jim Johnson, who ran a Dodge Polara stocker, and who had won the B/SA title in 1963; Jim Nelson; and Dode Martin. 
(Nix tried to persuade Chrisman to get Mercury Racing Director Fran Hernandez to allow him to run his Comet&#x27;s 427 on nitro, as a way to gain leverage on NHRA, so Nix could use nitro himself).

Their debut was at San Diego Raceway in March 1964, for a three-race exhibition. While in theory all were identical, Nix would change slicks or add lead shot in the trunk of his Dodge 330 to improve traction.

For their part, the Dodge factory spent only US$250,000 on the inaugural season, insufficient for a single car, let alone three, an amount arranged by promoter Don Beebe, who persuaded Wally Parks safety would not be compromised, promising the cars would be built to Super Stock standard.

Three months after the Chargers&#x27; debut, the factory-backed Sachs and Sons 1964 Mercury Comet, powered by a supercharged 427 wedge engine, made its debut, at the 1964 Nationals in Indianapolis. Driven by Jack Chrisman, and entered in B/FD, the Comet created a sensation.

When Chrisman&#x27;s Comet first ran in Indy, the Charger program had been waylaid by financial issues and parts shortages. Their final race appearance was at a Greer, South Carolina, dragstrip, in July 1964. Nix, disappointed, went back to TG/D. Chrisman&#x27;s Comet was placed in the B/Fuel Dragster class at Indianapolis; he was defeated in eliminations, but not before recording a pass of 10.25 seconds at mph.

The success of these cars inspired other racers to give up class racing for supercharged exhibition cars, led by &quot;Arnie Farmer&quot; Beswick and his Pontiac GTO, Gary Dyer&#x27;s hemi Dodge A/FX (financed by Norm Krause, &quot;Mister Norm&quot;), and

Funny cars proved enormously popular, with cars driven by Chrisman and Beswick setting track records all over the U.S. The first wave of funny car development ended around 1965, when bracket racer Jim Liberman and crew chief Lew Arrington made a deal with Pontiac to supply rare hemis (remnants of Mickey Thompson&#x27;s gas dragster program). (The duo later switched to Chrysler powerplants.) Two of the Dodge trio would return in 1965 as the Guzler Chargers team, powered by supercharged, nitro-fuelled hemis, with direct drive; both crashed the same year. The popularity of funny car grew that year, with January&#x27;s AHRA Winternationals seeing seven entrants: the Ramchargers, ”Dandy Dick” Landy, and Bud Faubel, in Dodges; and Butch Leal, Sox &amp; Martin, the Golden Commandos, and Lee Smith in Plymouths. By June, the number was over a dozen, including factory Mustangs and Cyclones with 427 “cammers”.

A dedicated funny car class was tried by NHRA at one 1966 national event, and at two in 1968, before Funny Car Eliminator was created in 1969. The trend to flip-top fiberglass bodies (&quot;floppers&quot;) began with Jim Lytle&#x27;s US$2000 Allison V-1710-powered chopped &#x27;34 Tudor &quot;Big Al II&quot;. It would inspire &quot;every flopper body ever formed.&quot; Chrysler&#x27;s dominance led Hernandez and Al Turner to try and turn things in Mercury&#x27;s favor; Don Nicholson&#x27;s flip-top, tube-chassis Comet, arriving in 1966, changed everything. The “flopper” bodied Comets were highly successful in the hands of Chrisman, Kenz and Leslie, and Eddie Schartman; at the 1966 World Final, Schartman would become NHRA&#x27;s first official Funny Car title winner.

Tom McEwen, better known for his dragster racing, flirted with funny cars in 1965, as did Lou Barney, a veteran slingshot racer; Barney&#x27;s hemi-powered, mid-engined Barracuda proved unsafe before being replaced by another, which turned out to be &quot;one of the quickest early match racers&quot;. So did Gary Gabelich, probably better known for land speed racing, in the Beach City Chevrolet-sponsored Sting Ray.

Before TF/FC became an official class, funny cars were run as B/FDs and C/FDs (B and C/Fuel Dragster), an odd classification, since they were bodied cars, not dragsters.

In 1965, Ford produced Holman and Moody-built fiberglass-bodied Mustangs for (among others) Gas Ronda, who was the most successful Ford racer. In 1966, Mercury offered a revolutionary flopper-bodied Comet, as exemplified by Don Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Eliminator I&quot;, which clocked a 7.98 at Detroit Dragway in its debut season, the quickest of the fuel injected cars. The car was built by Logghe Bros. (based in Detroit) (with bodies by Fiberglass Trends), weighing in around , making it heavier than most contemporary top fuel dragsters. (It would be the first Funny Car on the cover of &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, in April 1966.) Similar cars went to Chrisman, &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Schartman, and Kenz and Leslie. These cars had the first coilover suspension in funny car, and were powered by Hilborn-injected 427 SOHCs producing on 80% nitro. (Chrisman&#x27;s was the oddity, a roadster running a 6-71 GMC supercharger.) They were capable of mid-seven second e.t.s at around . Schartman (working with Roy Steffey, on the &quot;Flip-Top Fueler&quot;) would beat Chrisman for Top Funny Car at the NHRA World Finals in 1966 at Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a pass of 8.28 at . Nicholson would fit a Pete Robinson-built Top Fuel 427 SOHC late in the 1967 season and turn 7.90s at around , earning an eighty-six percent winning record. (The success of the Top Fuel-engined Comets would eventually prompt both Ford and Chrysler to drop funny car sponsorship.) In 1967, Doug Thorley would record the first (unofficial) funny car pass in his Corvair at Lions.

Even in 1965, Ford factory support wavered since the manufacturer did not build street versions of the radically altered cars; by 1968, pioneering Chrysler was also considering withdrawal. Of the privateers in this era, Bruce Larson&#x27;s &quot;USA-1&quot; (a &#x27;66 Chevelle with a Hilborn-injected 427 and four-speed) was the most successful. Among other early funny car competitors were Hayden Proffitt, who faced Chrisman at Lions Dragway in 1966 and won in a Hicks and Sublet-chassised Corvair. Butch Leal would body one of Logghe&#x27;s first customer chassis with a fiberglass Plymouth Barracuda and run an injected 426 Hemi on 100% nitro; this car&#x27;s best pass would be a 7.82 at , with a career win ratio of ninety percent. In 1967, Proffitt would take over the failed Grant &quot;Rebel SST&quot; AMC Rambler, aided by Les Shockley, &quot;Famous&quot; Amos Satterlee, and Dwight Guild. Gene Conway built the hemi Jeep &quot;Destroyer&quot; (sponsored by the U.S. Navy), and scored so much success, NHRA banned Jeep funny cars in 1967.

Logghe proved unable to keep up with the demand for their chassis, leading to the creation of a funny car chassis-building industry, which was soon joined by Dick Fletcher, Don Hardy, Ronnie Scrima, and a number of others. Late in 1969, Pat Foster and John Buttera would devise a Top Fuel dragster-style chassis to replace the &quot;dune buggy&quot; design common at the time. This would go under the Mustang Mach Is of Danny Ongais and Mickey Thompson. Similar chassis would be built by Logghe, Scrima, Buttera, Woody Gilmore, Don Long, and Steve Plueger, among others; this design remains the standard in TF/FC.

In 1968, Thorley would drive a rear-engined Javelin, built by Woody Gilmore, powered by an AMC 401. (This engine would later be replaced by a 392 Hemi prepared by John Hoven and Glenn Okazaki.) That same year, Leal would sell his &#x27;cuda to Don Schumacher.

NHRA created the new Funny Car (TF/FC) class at the NHRA Winternationals in 1969; Funny Car Eliminator (FCE) would be won by Clare Sanders, teammate of &quot;Jungle Jim&quot; Liberman. Tragedy struck the same year, with the death of Jerry Schwartz in the ex-Foster Mach I. In a virtually identical car (except the color), Ongais won a number of rounds, with passes frequently in the low sevens at over , including taking Funny Car Eliminator at the USnats. Gene Snow would record the first official pass in the Keith Black-engined, Logghe-chassised 1969 Dodge Charger, &quot;Rambunctious&quot;. One of the most famous (and popular) funny cars in NHRA history would appear in 1969: &quot;Chi-Town Hustler&quot;, a Charger prepared by Fakonas and Coil (driven by Pat Minnick).

Another Funny Car record was set in 1970 by Leroy Goldstein (&quot;The Israeli Rocket&quot;), then testing Firestone tires, with a 6.99 pass at Capitol Raceway, Funny Car&#x27;s first under seven seconds. By November, Jake Johnson in the hemi-powered &quot;Blue Max&quot; (driving for Harry Schmidt) turned in a 6.72 at , at OCIR. The big news that year was the creation of Mattel Hot Wheels-sponsored team of Don Prudhomme and Tom McEwen.

Don Garlits&#x27; 1971 accident in Top Fuel Dragster, which led to the creation of the revolutionary &quot;Swamp Rat XIV&quot;, did not produce the same kind of change in Funny Car, though there had been a number of rear-engined examples, including Thorley&#x27;s Javelin and Dave Bowman&#x27;s &quot;California Stud&quot;, which was the most successful of the rear-engined funny cars.

The Funny Car Eliminator title at the 1971 Winternats would go to Roland Leong&#x27;s Charger, &quot;Hawaiian&quot;.

At the 1972 Supernationals, Jim Dunn recorded a historic win in his Barracuda, the first and only, won by a mid-engined funny car.

In 1973, Shirley Muldowney teamed up with Connie Kalitta as the &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot; and &quot;Bounty Huntress&quot; in a pair of Ford Mustangs, hers a Buttera chassis, his a Logghe.

Between 1973 and 1975, Ed &quot;The Ace&quot; McCulloch would score eighteen wins at NHRA national events in the Revell-sponsored Dodge Dart, &quot;Revellution&quot;.

Shirl Greer would defeat Prudhomme in the final in 1974 to take the first NHRA Funny Car World Championship. He would suffer severe burns in the final after an engine exploded.

In 1975, Raymond Beadle and Harry Schmidt resurrected the &quot;Blue Max&quot;; built by Tony Casarez Race Cars, the Mustang II would win at Indianapolis. Beadle later bought out Schmidt and went on to seven funny car national titles, four with NHRA, three with IHRA.

Mark Oswald, driving for Candies and Hughes (with Old Milwaukee sponsorship), in 1984 did something no other driver has: he won both the NHRA and IHRA world championships. The team took four IHRA titles between 1983 and 1987, including two in a row, 1986 and 1987, as well as beating John Force in the 1986 Big Bud Shootout (losing to him the next year).

Force between 1987 and 1996, won sixty-seven of 203 NHRA national events, four of nine Big Bud Shootouts, and six World Championships. In 1996, with Austin Coil tuning, Force went to the final round in sixteen of nineteen national events, taking thirteen wins, one of the best records ever in Funny Car history. Force&#x27;s domination in 1989 would only really be challenged by Bruce Larson, a long-time East Coast match racer, with Outlaw sprint car driver Maynard Yingst as his tuner, winning six events and taking the runner-up spot five times, in an Oldsmobile sponsored by Sentry. In 1992, the honor of putting Force on the trailer would go to Cruz Pedregon, driving the Larry Minor McDonald&#x27;s-sponsored Olds to the championship. Pedregon was also one of the first Funny Car drivers to clock a five-second e.t.

Ed McCulloch in 1988 would claim the US$100,000 prize for winning both IHRA TF/FC events at Texas Motorplex; Eddie Hill would do the same in TFD that year. (Billy Meyer, who owned IHRA and offered the prize, would sell at season&#x27;s end.)

Kenny Bernstein and tuner Dale Armstrong would turn to land speed racers the Arivett brothers to design Bernstein&#x27;s car in 1989. This car would be dubbed the &quot;Batmobile&quot;. It would profoundly change Funny Car aerodynamics.

In 1991, Jim White, driving for Leong, turned in two of the fastest Funny Car passes to date, at over , and placed second to Force in the championship.

Al and Helen Hoffman, with tuner Tom Anderson, &quot;were the antithesis of the corporate button-down shirt racers.&quot; Sponsored by Blower Drive Service and later Sears, Roebuck, &amp; Co., during the 1990s, Hoffman earned eleven national event wins, as well as the 1991 Winston Invitational and the U. S. Nationals non-championship money race in 1991, 1994, and 1995.

Tom McEwen would build his &quot;gorgeous&quot; replica &#x27;57 Funny Car, running it as an NHRA exhibition vehicle and creating Nostalgia Funny Car, even though the car would not (now) be legal in that class.

Major corporate sponsorship money came to Funny Car starting in 1997, leading to significant changes in the sport. Multi-car teams, with several tuners each, became commonplace, and single car teams &quot;had a very slim chance of winning an NHRA World Championship&quot;. Force&#x27;s domination would continue, with ten NHRA FC World Championship wins from 1993 to 2002, including six straight 1997–2002; his success was so amazing he was accused of cheating (and was willing to strip off his firesuit to prove he was not). Between 1997 and 2006, Force went to the final in 105 of 228 events and took sixty-one tour wins, as well as qualifying for all ten Big Bud Shootouts, winning in 2000 and 2006. On top of that, he had ten of the quickest or fastest passes in Funny Car.

In recent years, a resurgence of interest in vintage drag cars has created many new &quot;nostalgia&quot; funny cars, which are newly made vintage-style funny car bodies mounted on modern funny car frames or, in certain cases, newly built frames that look close to the originals and are made NHRA legal. These &quot;Nostalgia Funny Cars&quot; often compete in various nostalgia drag racing events, such as the NHRA Heritage Hot Rod Racing Series, which includes the National Hot Rod Reunion and the California Hot Rod Reunion.

In 2007, NHRA limited technical innovation in Funny Car, as well as introducing a track length and restrictions on maximum engine revs.

Nitro Funny Car racing has never been more competitive than since 2006. The dominance of John Force Racing ended in 2006 and between 2007 and 2015 was equalled by DSR, with three TF/FC titles each. Funny Car is dominated by multi-car teams, with only Cruz Pedregon, Jim Dunn, and Tim Wilkerson maintaining the traditional one-car operation.

== NHRA Nitro Funny Car champions ==

Currently, John Force is the driver in the Funny Car class with the most wins, having 16 championships, more than 1,000 round wins and also 157 career wins. He is also the owner with the most Funny Car championships with 21, since Tony Pedregon (2003), Robert Hight (2009, 2017 and 2019), and Austin Prock (2024) have won five titles while on his team. Force&#x27;s former crew chief, Austin Coil, also has logged the highest number of wins in that position.

<doc id="240052" wikidata="Q1165978" url="?curid=240052" title="Darian calendar">
<text>The Darian calendar is a proposed system of timekeeping designed to serve the needs of any possible future human settlers on the planet Mars. It was created by aerospace engineer, political scientist, and space jurist Thomas Gangale in 1985 and named by him after his son Darius. It was first published in June 1986. In 1998 at the founding convention of the Mars Society the calendar was presented as one of two calendar options to be considered along with eighteen other factors to consider for the colonization of Mars.

Due to the use of 28 sol months, the Darian calendar has no mechanism for synchronization with Earth dates or with synodic periods.

==Year length and intercalation==
The basic time periods from which the calendar is constructed are the Martian solar day (sometimes called a sol) and the Martian vernal equinox year. The sol is 39 minutes 35.244 seconds longer than the Terrestrial solar day, and the Martian vernal equinox year is 668.5907 sols in length (which corresponds to 686.9711 days on Earth).

The basic intercalation formula therefore allocates six 669-sol years and four 668-sol years to each Martian decade. The former are still called leap years, even though they are more common than non-leap years, and are years that are either odd (not evenly divisible by 2) or are evenly divisible by 10: this produces 6,686 sols per ten years, giving an average year of 668.6 sols.

A 1998 iteration of the Darian calendar had leap years cancelled if the year was divisible by 100, unless the year was also divisible by 500; adding these rules produces an average year of 668.592 sols, a more reasonable approximation. 

However, these static intercalation schemes did not take into account the slowly increasing length of the Martian vernal equinox year. Thus, in 2006, Gangale devised a series of intercalation formulas, all of which have in common the basic decennial cycle, as shown in the following table:

This extended intercalation scheme gives an average year of 668.59453 days over a 10,000-year period: this results in an error of only about one sol at the end of 12,000 Martian years, or the year 24,180 of the Common Era.

==Calendar layout==
The year is divided into 24 months. The first 5 months in each quarter have 28 sols, while the final month has 27 sols unless it is the final month of a leap year, when it contains the leap sol as its final sol.

The calendar maintains a seven-sol week, but the week is restarted from its first sol at the start of each month. If a month has 27 sols, this causes the final sol of the week to be omitted. 

This is partly for tidiness and can also be rationalised as making the average length of the Martian week close to the average length of the Terrestrial week; 28 Earth days is very close to Martian sols, whereas a month is an average length of Martian sols.

In the table, the sols of the week are Sol Solis, Sol Lunae, Sol Martis, Sol Mercurii, Sol Jovis, Sol Veneris, Sol Saturni.

The last sol of Vrishika is an intercalary sol that only occurs on leap years, like February 29 in the Gregorian calendar.

== Start of year ==
The Martian year is treated as beginning near the equinox marking spring in the northern hemisphere of the planet. Mars currently has an axial inclination similar to that of the Earth, so the Martian seasons are perceptible, though the greater eccentricity of Mars&#x27; orbit about the Sun compared with that of the Earth means that their significance is strongly amplified in the southern hemisphere and masked in the northern hemisphere.

== Epoch ==
Gangale originally chose late 1975 as the epoch of the calendar in recognition of the American Viking program as the first fully successful (American) soft landing mission to Mars (the earlier 1971 Soviet Mars 3 Landing having delivered only 15 seconds of data from the planet&#x27;s surface). In 2002 he adopted the Telescopic Epoch, first suggested by Peter Kokh in 1999 and adopted by Shaun Moss in 2001 for his &quot;Utopian Calendar&quot;, which is in 1609 in recognition of Johannes Kepler&#x27;s use of Tycho Brahe&#x27;s observations of Mars to elucidate the laws of planetary motion, and also Galileo Galilei&#x27;s first observations of Mars with a telescope. Selection of the Telescopic Epoch thus unified the structures of the Darian and Utopian calendars, their remaining differences being nomenclatural. It also avoids the problem of the many telescopic observations of Mars over the past 400 years being relegated to negative dates.

== Nomenclature ==
The Darian calendar has been widely imitated. Suggested variations abound on the internet that use different nomenclature schemata for the days of the week and the months of the year. In the original Darian calendar, the names of the 24 months were provisionally chosen by Gangale as the Latin names of constellations of the zodiac and their Sanskrit equivalents in alternation. The 7 sols of the week, similarly, were provisionally named after the Sun, the largest Martian moon Phobos (Sol Phobotis) and the 5 brightest planets as seen from Mars including Earth (Sol Terrae). These were later modified to follow the familiar convention of the Romance languages, replacing Sol Phobotis with Sol Lunae and Sol Terrae with Sol Martis. The &quot;Darian Defrost Calendar&quot;, however, uses the &quot;Rotterdam System&quot; to create new names for the Martian months out of patterns relating letter choice and name length to month order and season. The &quot;Utopian Calendar&quot;, devised by the Mars Time Group in 2001, also has additional suggestions for nomenclature modification.
== Mars Julian sol ==
The Mars Julian sol count is analogous to the Julian Day count on Earth, in that it is a continuous numerical counting of days from an epoch. The Mars Julian sol epoch is the same as for the Darian calendar, thus Mars Julian sol 0 is 1 Sagittarius 0.

== Comparison with timekeeping systems in planetary science ==
Since the Darian calendar is designed as a civil calendar for human communities on Mars, it has no precise analog in the scientific community, which has no need to mark Martian time in terms of weeks or months. Two unrelated epochs that have gained some traction in the scientific community are the Mars sol date and the Mars year. In 1998 Michael Allison proposed the Mars sol date epoch of 29 December 1873 (Julian Day 2405521.502). In 2000 R. T. Clancy &quot;et al.&quot; proposed the Mars year 1 set to the epoch 11 April 1955 (Julian Day 2435208.456). The Clancy Mars year is reckoned from one Martian northward equinox to the next (Ls = 0°), and specific dates within a given year are expressed in Ls. The Clancy Mars year count is approximately equal to the Darian year count minus 183. The Allison Mars sol date epoch equates to Ls = 276.6° in a year that is undefined in the Clancy Mars year count. It converts to 25 Virgo 140 on the Darian calendar and Mars Julian sol 94128.511.

== Martiana calendar ==
In 2002 Gangale devised a variant of the Darian calendar that reconciles the months and the sols of the week in a repeating pattern and removes the need to omit days of the week. In the Martiana variant, all the months in a given quarter begin on the same sol of the week, but the sol that begins each month shifts from one quarter to the next, based on the scheme devised by the astronomer Robert G. Aitken in 1936.

The following table shows the sol of the week on which each month in the quarter begins. The first quarter corresponds to spring in the Martian northern hemisphere and autumn in the Martian southern hemisphere.

The leap sol occurs at the end of odd-numbered years as in the original Darian calendar. Since the last month of odd-numbered years contains 28 sols, the following year also begins on Sol Solis, resulting in a two-year cycle over which the relationship of the sols of the week to the months repeats. The sol that is added every tenth year is epagomenal (not counted as part of the week), thus the two-year rotation of the sols of the week is not disrupted. The Martiana scheme avoids the Darian calendar&#x27;s need to shorten the week to six sols three to four times per year. The disadvantage is that the scheme results in a two-year cycle for reconciling the sols of the week and the months, whereas the Darian calendar is repeatable from month to month.

== Other Darian calendars ==
In 1998 Gangale adapted the Darian calendar for use on the four Galilean moons of Jupiter discovered by Galileo in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. In 2003 he created a variant of the calendar for Titan.

== Important dates in Martian history ==

*Mars dates are approximate where the exact (Earth) time of the event is not stated.

== The Darian calendar in fiction ==
Gangale was inspired to create the calendar after reading &quot;Red Planet&quot;, a 1949 science fiction book by Robert A. Heinlein. In the book, Heinlein postulates a 24-month Martian calendar.

The Darian calendar is mentioned in several works of fiction set on Mars:

<text>Masculinity (also called manhood or manliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with men and boys. Masculinity can be theoretically understood as socially constructed, and there is also evidence that some behaviors considered masculine are influenced by both cultural factors and biological factors. To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate. It is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex, as anyone can exhibit masculine traits. Standards of masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods. In Western cultures, its meaning is traditionally drawn from being contrasted with femininity.

==Overview==

Standards of manliness or masculinity vary across different cultures, subcultures, ethnic groups and historical periods. Traits traditionally viewed as masculine in Western society include strength, courage, independence, leadership, dominance, and assertiveness. When women&#x27;s labor participation increased, there were men who felt less comfortable in their masculinity because it was increasingly difficult for them to reconfirm their status as the breadwinner.

The academic study of masculinity received increased attention during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the number of courses on the subject in the United States rising from 30 to over 300. This has sparked investigation of the intersection of masculinity with concepts from other fields, such as the social construction of gender difference (prevalent in a number of philosophical and sociological theories).

People regardless of biological sex may exhibit masculine traits and behavior. Those exhibiting both masculine and feminine characteristics are considered androgynous, and feminist philosophers have argued that gender ambiguity may blur gender classification.

==History==
The concept of masculinity varies historically and culturally. Since what constitutes masculinity has varied by time and place, according to Raewyn Connell, it is more appropriate to discuss &quot;masculinities&quot; than a single overarching concept.

=== Antiquity===

Ancient literature dates back to about 3000 BC, with explicit expectations for men in the form of laws and implied masculine ideals in myths of gods and heroes. According to the &quot;Code of Hammurabi&quot; (about 1750 BC):
* Rule 3: &quot;If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death.&quot;
* Rule 128: &quot;If a man takes a woman to wife, but has no intercourse with her, this woman is no wife to him.&quot;

In the Hebrew Bible of 1000 BC, when King David of Israel drew near to death, he told his son Solomon: &quot;I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man&quot;.

In his book Germania (98 AD), Tacitus stated that the men from the ancient Germanic tribes fought aggressively in battle to protect their women from capture by the enemy.&quot;It stands on record that armies already wavering and on the point of collapse have been rallied by the women, pleading heroically with their men, thrusting forward their bared bosoms, and making them realize the imminent prospect of enslavement - a fate which the Germans fear more desperately for their women than for themselves.&quot; -Tacitus (Germania)Tacitus presented the Germanic warrior Arminius as a masculine hero in his account of ancient Germany whose already violent nature was further heightened by the abduction of his beloved wife Thusnelda by the Roman general Germanicus. In his rage Arminius demanded war against the Roman empire.

===Medieval and Victorian eras===
Jeffrey Richards describes a European &quot;medieval masculinity which was essentially Christian and chivalric,&quot; which included concepts like courage, respect for women of all classes and generosity. According to David Rosen, the traditional view of scholars (such as J. R. R. Tolkien) that &quot;Beowulf&quot; is a tale of medieval heroism overlooks the similarities between Beowulf and the monster Grendel. The masculinity exemplified by Beowulf &quot;cut[s] men off from women, other men, passion and the household&quot;.

In Arab culture, Hatim al-Tai is known to be a model of Arab manliness. It is said that he used to give away everything he possessed except for his mount and weapons.

During the Victorian era, masculinity underwent a transformation from traditional heroism. Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1831: &quot;The old ideal of Manhood has grown obsolete, and the new is still invisible to us, and we grope after it in darkness, one clutching this phantom, another that; Werterism, Byronism, even Brummelism, each has its day&quot;.

Boxing was professionalized in America and Europe in the 19th century; it emphasized the physical and confrontational aspects of masculinity. Bare-knuckle boxing without gloves represented &quot;the manly art&quot; in 19th-century America.

=== 20th century to present ===

At the beginning of the 20th century, most families in the western world consisted of a father working outside the home as breadwinner and a mother as working homemaker in the home, often working together to raise children and/or taking care of elderly family members. The roles were often divided quite sharply between providing resources (considered masculine) and maintenance and redistribution of resources (considered feminine). Despite women&#x27;s increasing participation in the paid labor force and contributions to family income, men&#x27;s identities remained centered on their working lives and specifically their economic contributions. In 1963, social theorist Erving Goffman&#x27;s seminal work on stigma management presented a list of traits prescribed as categorically masculine for American men:In an important sense there is only one complete unblushing male in America: a young, married, white, urban, northern, heterosexual Protestant father of college education, fully employed, of good complexion, weight and height, and a recent record in sports.:128

Writing in 1974, R. Gould asserted that the provider role was central to adult men&#x27;s identities, as masculinity is often measured by the size of a man&#x27;s economic contribution to the family. Masculinity is also associated with denying characteristics associated with women. Overwhelmingly, the construction of masculinity most valued in the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st century is one that is independent, sexually assertive, and athletic, among other normative markers of manhood. There is some evidence of this construction developing slightly however. A 2008 study showed that men frequently rank good health, a harmonious family life and a good relationship with their spouse or partner as more important to their quality of life than physical attractiveness and success with women. The advent of social media has been associated with the ability to form emotional and supportive relationships with others.

==Development==
===Nature versus nurture===
Scholars have debated the extent to which gender identity and gender-specific behaviors are due to socialization versus biological factors. Social and biological influences are thought to be mutually interacting during development. Studies of prenatal androgen exposure have provided some evidence that femininity and masculinity are partly biologically determined. Other possible biological influences include evolution, genetics, epigenetics, and hormones (both during development and in adulthood). Scholars suggest that innate differences between the sexes are compounded or exaggerated by the influences of social factors. However, others have pointed to the fact that personality differences between the sexes are seen to increase with increased levels of egalitarianism.

===Social construction of masculinity===
Across cultures, characteristics of masculinity are similar in essence but varying in detail, another shared pattern is that non-typical behavior of one&#x27;s sex or gender may be viewed as a social problem. In sociology, this labeling is known as gender assumptions and is part of socialization to meet the mores of a society. Non-standard behavior may be considered indicative of homosexuality, despite the fact that gender expression, gender identity and sexual orientation are widely accepted as distinct concepts. When sexuality is defined in terms of object choice (as in early sexology studies), male homosexuality may be interpreted as effeminacy. Machismo is a form of masculinity that emphasizes power and is often associated with a disregard for consequences and responsibility.

Some believe that masculinity is linked to the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with male genitalia. Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct. Many aspects of masculinity assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven. Males were more likely to be depicted in a less humorous way in the evening as opposed to the daytime, whereas females were more likely to be rated in a less humorous way in the daytime as opposed to the evening. Reeser argues that although the military has a vested interest in constructing and promoting a specific form of masculinity, it does not create it. Facial hair is linked to masculinity through language, in stories about boys becoming men when they begin to shave.

Some social scientists conceptualize masculinity (and femininity) as a performance. Gender performances may not necessarily be intentional and people may not even be aware of the extent to which they are performing gender, as one outcome of lifelong gender socialization is the feeling that one&#x27;s gender is &quot;natural&quot; or biologically ordained.

Masculine performance varies over the life course, but also from one context to another. For instance, the sports world may elicit more traditionally normative masculinities in participants than would other settings. Men who exhibit a tough and aggressive masculinity on the sports field may display a softer masculinity in familial contexts. Masculinities vary by social class as well. Studies suggest working class constructions of masculinity to be more normative than are those from middle class men and boys. As these contexts and comparisons illustrate, theorists suggest a multiplicity of masculinities, not simply one single construction of masculinity.

Historian Kate Cooper wrote: &quot;Wherever a woman is mentioned a man&#x27;s character is being judged – and along with it what he stands for.&quot; Scholars cite integrity and equality as masculine values in male-male relationships.

====Gay and lesbian people====

Gay men are considered by some to be &quot;effeminate and deviate from the masculine norm&quot; and are sometimes benevolently stereotyped as &quot;gentle and refined&quot;, even by other gay men. According to gay human-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell:
Contrary to the well-intentioned claim that gays are &quot;just the same&quot; as straights, there is a difference. What is more, the distinctive style of gay masculinity is of great social benefit. Wouldn&#x27;t life be dull without the flair and imagination of queer fashion designers and interior decorators? How could the NHS cope with no gay nurses, or the education system with no gay teachers? Society should thank its lucky stars that not all men turn out straight, macho and insensitive. The different hetero and homo modes of maleness are not, of course, biologically fixed.

Psychologist Joseph Pleck argues that a hierarchy of masculinity exists largely as a dichotomy of homosexual and heterosexual males: &quot;Our society uses the male heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are &quot;real men&quot; and have power, and males who are not&quot;. Michael Kimmel adds that the trope &quot;You&#x27;re so gay&quot; indicates a lack of masculinity, rather than homosexual orientation. According to Pleck, to avoid male oppression of women, themselves and other men, patriarchal structures, institutions and discourse must be eliminated from Western society.

In the documentary &quot;The Butch Factor&quot;, gay men (one of them transgender) were asked about their views of masculinity. Masculine traits were generally seen as an advantage in and out of the closet, allowing &quot;butch&quot; gay men to conceal their sexual orientation longer while engaged in masculine activities such as sports. Some did not see themselves as effeminate, and felt little connection to gay culture. Some effeminate gay men in &quot;The Butch Factor&quot; felt uncomfortable about their femininity (despite being comfortable with their sexuality), and feminine gay men may be derided by stereotypically masculine gays.

Feminine-looking men tended to come out earlier after being labeled gay by their peers. More likely to face bullying and harassment throughout their lives, they are taunted by derogatory words (such as &quot;sissy&quot;) implying feminine qualities. Effeminate, &quot;campy&quot; gay men sometimes use what John R. Ballew called &quot;camp humor&quot;, such as referring to one another by female pronouns (according to Ballew, &quot;a funny way of defusing hate directed toward us [gay men]&quot;); however, such humor &quot;can cause us [gay men] to become confused in relation to how we feel about being men&quot;. He further stated:

A study by the Center for Theoretical Study at Charles University in Prague and the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic found significant differences in shape among the faces of 66 heterosexual and gay men, with gay men having more &quot;stereotypically masculine&quot; features (&quot;undermin[ing] stereotypical notions of gay men as more feminine looking.&quot;) However, other studies with larger sample sizes have found that homosexual men were seen as significantly more feminine and less masculine than those of heterosexual men Furthermore, a 2017 study utilized neural networks to see whether artificial intelligence would be able to differentiate accurately between more than 35,000 images of gay and straight faces. The results showed that the &quot;classifier could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81% of cases, and in 71% of cases for women.&quot; Supporting the idea that men&#x27;s faces are perceived as more feminine, analysis suggests that gay men have more &quot;gender-atypical facial morphology, expression and grooming styles&quot;.

Gay men have been presented in the media as feminine and open to ridicule, although films such as &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; are countering the stereotype. A recent development is the portrayal of gay men in the LGBT community as &quot;bears&quot;, a subculture of gay men celebrating rugged masculinity and &quot;secondary sexual characteristics of the male: facial hair, body hair, proportional size, baldness&quot;.

In the &quot;Soft Heroes&quot; series, French artist Thomas Liu Le Lann questions concepts of post-heroic masculinity. These fabric figures refer to transhuman bodies beyond heteronormativity and question conventional notions of strength and agency. The Austrian literary scientist Rebecca Heinrich, her research interests include homosexuality and masculinities in the literary discourse of the 20th and 21st centuries, HIV/AIDS as a theme and motif, hero narratives, literary mediation, performative poetry and literature in the Anthropocene, describes the &quot;Soft Heroes&quot; as “es”, as the trans-human beings are on the edge of formlessness and refuse to be assigned a gender.

Second-wave pro-feminism paid greater attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and hegemonic masculinity. This shift led to increased cooperation between the men&#x27;s liberation and gay liberation movements developing, in part, because masculinity was understood as a social construct and in response to the universalization of &quot;men&quot; in previous men&#x27;s movements. Men&#x27;s rights activists worked to stop second-wave feminists from influencing the gay-rights movement, promoting hypermasculinity as inherent to gay sexuality.

Masculinity has played an important role in lesbian culture, although lesbians vary widely in the degree to which they express masculinity and femininity. In LGBT cultures, masculine women are often referred to as &quot;butch&quot;.

====Hegemonic masculinity====
Traditional avenues for men to gain honor were providing for their families and exercising leadership. Raewyn Connell has labeled traditional male roles and privileges hegemonic masculinity, encouraged in men and discouraged in women: &quot;Hegemonic masculinity can be defined as the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of patriarchy, which guarantees the dominant position of men and the subordination of women&quot;. Connell (1987) placed emphasis on heterosexuality and its influence on the construction of gender. From this perspective, there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealized form of masculinity in every social system and an apotheosized form of femininity that is considered proper for men and women. This idealized form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalizes certain performances of men, and pathologizes, marginalizes, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalized and subordinated), which, according to a plethora of studies, are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasized femininity, marginalized and subordinated masculinities). In addition to describing forceful articulations of violent masculine identities, hegemonic masculinity has also been used to describe implicit, indirect, or coercive forms of gendered socialization, enacted through video games, fashion, humor, and so on.

====Precarious manhood====
Researchers have argued that the &quot;precariousness&quot; of manhood contributes to traditionally masculine behavior. &quot;Precarious&quot; means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved. In many cultures, boys endure painful initiation rituals to become men. Manhood may also be lost, as when a man is derided for not &quot;being a man&quot;. Researchers have found that men respond to threats to their manhood by engaging in stereotypically masculine behaviors and beliefs, such as supporting hierarchy, espousing homophobic beliefs, supporting aggression and choosing physical tasks over intellectual ones.

In 2014, Winegard and Geary wrote that the precariousness of manhood involves social status (prestige or dominance), and manhood may be more (or less) precarious due to the avenues men have for achieving status.

==In women==

Although often ignored in discussions of masculinity, women can also express masculine traits and behaviors. In Western culture, female masculinity has been codified into identities such as &quot;tomboy&quot; and &quot;butch&quot;. Although female masculinity is often associated with lesbianism, expressing masculinity is not necessarily related to a woman&#x27;s sexuality. In feminist philosophy, female masculinity is often characterized as a type of gender performance which challenges traditional masculinity and male dominance. Zachary A. Kramer argues that the discussion of masculinity should be opened up &quot;to include constructions of masculinity that uniquely affect women.&quot; Masculine women are often subject to social stigma and harassment, although the influence of the feminist movement has led to greater acceptance of women expressing masculinity in recent decades.

Women who participate in sports, especially male-dominated sports, are sometimes derided as being masculine. Even though most sports emphasize stereotypically masculine qualities, such as strength, competition, and aggression, women who participate in sports are still expected to conform to strictly feminine gender norms. This is known as the &quot;female athlete paradox&quot;. Although traditional gender norms are gradually changing, female athletes, especially those that participate in male-dominated sports such as boxing, weight lifting, American football, rugby, ice hockey, and motorsport, are still often viewed as deviating from the boundaries of femininity and may suffer negative repercussions.

Women face a similar paradox in the business world, as corporate leadership roles are widely associated with stereotypically masculine characteristics. Women who adopt these characteristics may be more successful, but also more disliked due to not conforming with expected feminine stereotypes. According to a study in the UK, women with stereotypically masculine personality traits are more likely to gain access to high-paying occupations than women with feminine personality traits. According to another study conducted in Germany, women who fit the stereotypical masculine gender role are generally more successful in their careers.

==Health==
Evidence points to the negative impact of hegemonic masculinity on men&#x27;s health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5 million fewer physician visits per year than women. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from heart disease. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than women, and are more likely to be diagnosed with a terminal illness because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.

Studies of men in North America and Europe show that men who consume alcoholic drinks often do so in order to fulfill certain social expectations of manliness. While the causes of drinking and alcoholism are complex and varied, gender roles and social expectations have a strong influence encouraging men to drink.

In 2004, Arran Stibbe published an analysis of a well-known men&#x27;s-health magazine in 2000. According to Stibbe, although the magazine ostensibly focused on health it also promoted traditional masculine behaviors such as excessive consumption of convenience foods and meat, alcohol consumption and unsafe sex. Masculinity and sexual health is also a complex issue in the Global South, as well. In South Africa, HIV transmission was one of the significant reasons for the development of masculinities research. Risky actions commonly representative of toxic masculinity are also present in Western and Chinese male clients&#x27; attitudes and behaviors toward female sex workers in China&#x27;s commercial sex industry. While many male clients frequently exhibited physical violence toward the female workers, in order to more overtly display their manliness, some men also admitted to being more sexually aggressive at times and purposefully having unprotected sex without the worker&#x27;s knowledge.

Research on beer-commercial content by Lance Strate yielded results relevant to a study of masculinity. In beer commercials, masculine behavior (especially risk-taking) is encouraged. Commercials often focus on situations in which a man overcomes an obstacle in a group, working or playing hard (construction workers, farm workers or cowboys). Those involving play have central themes of mastery (of nature or each other), risk and adventure: fishing, camping, playing sports or socializing in bars. There is usually an element of danger and a focus on movement and speed (watching fast cars or driving fast). The bar is a setting for the measurement of masculinity in skills such as billiards, strength, and drinking ability. Men engage in positive health practices, such as reducing fat intake and alcohol, to conform to masculine ideals.

Men, boys and people who were assigned male at birth face gender policing from people who think they are not masculine enough. Gender policing can increase the risk of alcoholism, anxiety, and depression.

==Criticism==
Study of the history of masculinity emerged during the 1980s, aided by the fields of women&#x27;s and (later) gender history. Before women&#x27;s history was examined, there was a &quot;strict gendering of the public/private divide&quot;; regarding masculinity, this meant little study of how men related to the household, domesticity and family life. Although women&#x27;s historical role was negated, despite the writing of history by (and primarily about) men, a significant portion of the male experience was missing. This void was questioned during the late 1970s, when women&#x27;s history began to analyze gender and women. Joan Scott&#x27;s seminal article, calling for gender studies as an analytical concept to explore society, power and discourse, laid the foundation for this field.

According to Scott, gender should be used in two ways: productive and produced. Productive gender examined its role in creating power relationships, and produced gender explored the use and change of gender throughout history. This has influenced the field of masculinity, as seen in Pierre Bourdieu&#x27;s definition of masculinity: produced by society and culture, and reproduced in daily life. A flurry of work in women&#x27;s history led to a call for study of the male role (initially influenced by psychoanalysis) in society and emotional and interpersonal life. Connell wrote that these initial works were marked by a &quot;high level of generality&quot; in &quot;broad surveys of cultural norms&quot;. The scholarship was aware of contemporary societal changes aiming to understand and evolve (or liberate) the male role in response to feminism.John Tosh calls for a return to this aim for the history of masculinity to be useful, academically and in the public sphere.

Two concerns over the study of the history of masculinity are that it would stabilize the historical process (rather than change it) and that a cultural overemphasis on the approach to masculinity lacks the reality of actual experience. According to John Tosh, masculinity has become a conceptual framework used by historians to enhance their cultural explorations instead of a specialty in its own right. This draws attention from reality to representation and meaning, not only in the realm of masculinity; culture was becoming &quot;the bottom line, the real historical reality&quot;. Tosh critiques Martin Francis&#x27; work in this light because popular culture, rather than the experience of family life, is the basis for Francis&#x27; argument. Francis uses contemporary literature and film to demonstrate that masculinity was restless, shying away from domesticity and commitment, during the late 1940s and 1950s. Francis wrote that this flight from commitment was &quot;most likely to take place at the level of fantasy (individual and collective)&quot;. In focusing on culture, it is difficult to gauge the degree to which films such as &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot; represented the era&#x27;s masculine fantasies. Michael Roper&#x27;s call to focus on the subjectivity of masculinity addresses this cultural bias, because broad understanding is set aside for an examination &quot;of what the relationship of the codes of masculinity is to actual men, to existential matters, to persons and to their psychic make-up&quot; (Tosh&#x27;s human experience).

According to Tosh, the culture of masculinity has outlived its usefulness because it cannot fulfill the initial aim of this history (to discover how manhood was conditioned and experienced) and he urged &quot;questions of behaviour and agency&quot;. His work on Victorian masculinity uses individual experience in letters and sketches to illustrate broader cultural and social customs, such as birthing or Christmas traditions.

Stefan Dudink believes that the methodological approach (trying to categorize masculinity as a phenomenon) undermined its historiographic development. Abigail Solomou-Godeau&#x27;s work on post-revolutionary French art addresses a strong, constant patriarchy.

Tosh&#x27;s overall assessment is that a shift is needed in conceptualizing the topic back to the history of masculinity as a speciality aiming to reach a broader audience, rather than as an analytical tool of cultural and social history. The importance he places on public history hearkens back to the initial aims of gender history, which sought to use history to enlighten and change the present. Tosh appeals to historians to live up to the &quot;social expectation&quot; of their work, which would also require a greater focus on subjectivity and masculinity. This view is contrary to Dudink&#x27;s; the latter called for an &quot;outflanking movement&quot; towards the history of masculinity, in response to the errors he perceived in the study. This would do the opposite of what Tosh called for, deconstructing masculinity by not placing it at the center of historical exploration and using discourse and culture as indirect avenues towards a more-representational approach. In a study of the Low Countries, Dudink proposes moving beyond the history of masculinity by embedding analysis into the exploration of nation and nationalism (making masculinity a lens through which to view conflict and nation-building). Martin Francis&#x27; work on domesticity through a cultural lens moves beyond the history of masculinity because &quot;men constantly travelled back and forward across the frontier of domesticity, if only in the realm of the imagination&quot;; normative codes of behavior do not fully encompass the male experience.

Media images of boys and young men may lead to the persistence of harmful concepts of masculinity. According to men&#x27;s-rights activists, the media does not address men&#x27;s-rights issues and men are often portrayed negatively in advertising. Peter Jackson called hegemonic masculinity &quot;economically exploitative&quot; and &quot;socially oppressive&quot;: &quot;The form of oppression varies from patriarchal controls over women&#x27;s bodies and reproductive rights, through ideologies of domesticity, femininity and compulsory heterosexuality, to social definitions of the value of work, the nature of skill and the differential remuneration of &#x27;productive&#x27; and &#x27;reproductive&#x27; labor.&quot;

===Psychological research===
According to a paper submitted by Tracy Tylka to the American Psychological Association, &quot;Instead of seeing a decrease in objectification of women in society, there has just been an increase in the objectification of both sexes. And you can see that in the media today.&quot; Men and women restrict food intake in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively thin body; in extreme cases, this leads to eating disorders. Psychiatrist Thomas Holbrook cited a recent Canadian study indicating that as many as one in six people with eating disorders are men.

Research in the United Kingdom found, &quot;Younger men and women who read fitness and fashion magazines could be psychologically harmed by the images of perfect female and male physiques.&quot; Young women and men exercise excessively in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively fit and muscular body, which may lead to body dysmorphic disorder or muscle dysmorphia. Although the stereotypes may have remained constant, the value attached to masculine stereotypes has changed; Todd Reeser has argued that masculinity is an unstable phenomenon, never ultimately achieved.

In January 2019, the American Psychological Association warns that conforming to traditional standards of masculinity can cause harm to mental health.

=== Gender-role stress===

In 1987, Eisler and Skidmore studied masculinity, creating the idea of &quot;masculine stress&quot; and finding three elements of masculinity which often result in emotional stress:
* The emphasis on prevailing in situations requiring body and fitness
* Being perceived as emotional
* The need for adequacy in sexual matters and financial status

Because of social norms and pressures associated with masculinity, men with spinal-cord injuries must adapt their self-identity to the losses associated with such injuries; this may &quot;lead to feelings of decreased physical and sexual prowess with lowered self-esteem and a loss of male identity. Feelings of guilt and overall loss of control are also experienced.&quot; Research also suggests that men feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising. Brett Martin and Juergen Gnoth (2009) found that although feminine men privately preferred feminine models, they expressed a preference for traditional masculine models in public; according to the authors, this reflected social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculine norms.

In their book &quot;Raising Cain: Protecting The Emotional Life of Boys&quot;, Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson wrote that although all boys are born loving and empathic, exposure to gender socialization (the tough male ideal and hypermasculinity) limits their ability to function as emotionally healthy adults. According to Kindlon and Thompson, boys lack the ability to understand and express emotions productively because of the stress imposed by masculine gender roles.

In the article &quot;Sexual Ethics, Masculinity and Mutual Vulnerability&quot;, Rob Cover works to unpack Judith Butler&#x27;s study of masculinity. Cover goes over issues such as sexual assault and how it can be partially explained by hypermasculinity.

=== Masculinity in crisis===
A theory of masculinity in crisis has emerged; Australian archeologist Peter McAllister said, &quot;I have a strong feeling that masculinity is in crisis. Men are really searching for a role in modern society; the things we used to do aren&#x27;t in much demand anymore&quot;. Others see the changing labor market as a source of stress. Deindustrialization and the replacement of smokestack industries by technology have allowed more women to enter the labor force, reducing its emphasis on physical strength.

The crisis has also been attributed to the questioning of male dominance and rights granted to men solely on the basis of sex following the feminist movement. British sociologist John MacInnes wrote that &quot;masculinity has always been in one crisis or another&quot;, suggesting that the crises arise from the &quot;fundamental incompatibility between the core principle of modernity that all human beings are essentially equal (regardless of their sex) and the core tenet of patriarchy that men are naturally superior to women and thus destined to rule over them&quot;.

According to John Beynon, masculinity and men are often conflated and it is unclear whether masculinity, men or both are in crisis. He writes that the &quot;crisis&quot; is not a recent phenomenon, illustrating several periods of masculine crisis throughout history (some predating the women&#x27;s movement and post-industrial society), suggesting that due to masculinity&#x27;s fluid nature &quot;crisis is constitutive of masculinity itself&quot;. Film scholar Leon Hunt also writes: &quot;Whenever masculinity&#x27;s &#x27;crisis&#x27; actually started, it certainly seems to have been in place by the 1970s&quot;.

===East Asian cultures===

In 2008, the word &quot;herbivore men&quot; became popular in Japan and was reported worldwide. Herbivore men refers to young Japanese men who naturally detach themselves from masculinity. Masahiro Morioka characterizes them as men 1) having gentle nature, 2) not bound by manliness, 3) not aggressive when it comes to romance, 4) viewing women as equals, and 5) hating emotional pain. Herbivore men are severely criticized by men who love masculinity. Some contemporary Japanese writers like Ao Omae have made the nature of masculinity a focus of their fiction.

In Chinese and Taiwanese popular culture, phrases such as &quot; (), &quot; (), and &quot;&quot; () are used as pejoratives referring to men exhibiting misogyny, dominance, and homophobia.

=== East African cultures ===
During Margrethe Silberschmidt&#x27;s research of urban and rural men in East Africa, she concludes that men experience disempowerment when they cannot fulfill their role as breadwinner and feel inferior to women when they cannot provide for their family. The changes in East Africa&#x27;s cultural and economic framework can partially be attributed to British colonial rule because it altered the gender division of labor. There was an increase in wage labor which led to a demand for more skilled workers in an environment where there were primarily unskilled workers. Eventually, there was a shift to growing cash crops and the emphasis was put on men to be the breadwinner. A man&#x27;s social value is traditionally connected to his ability to provide so when he can no longer do that, it negatively impacts his ego. Masculinity is seen as an entity to be protected, and when a man feels disempowered, he finds other ways to reaffirm their masculinity. Research that examines the struggles among men and look into their personal experiences can help to understand the social structures of masculinity.

== In the Global South ==
=== Westernized influence in the media ===
Masculinities as depicted in the media of countries categorized as the Global South can depict stereotypical gender roles in various ways. In India, such roles have been pushed through Bollywood films. Additionally, there is some indication that Westernized views of masculinity have been pushed onto a global audience through print media advertisements, as well. This has been observed in India with the expansion of availability of transnational men&#x27;s magazines. While there is some evidence of Western and specifically, North American, influence in advertisements found in Chinese and Taiwanese men&#x27;s magazines as well, it seems that more often than not, those countries&#x27; magazines have just adopted a globally uniform perception of masculinity. This theme also presents itself in visual depictions of men in Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Sports media outlets have not necessarily promoted a completely &quot;Westernized&quot; version of masculinity, and white, male sports icons may have had an impact when presented alongside those players of other races, such as Asians or black people. A 2019 study found that in Major League Baseball, for example, Korean players and their respective accomplishments tend to be pushed to the side when compared with white, male players in print media and online news outlets.

Novels may be affected by Westernized perceptions. Amjad Alsyouf argues that African novelists Tayeb Salih and Chinua Achebe, for example, bring some Western influence to the gender roles portrayed in their respective novels.

=== Visual portrayals in fashion ===
Masculinity is also an important concept in advertisement branding in the Islamic culture. In Kuwait, Muslim men must remain vigilant in making sure that their consumption decisions are representative of the socially accepted masculine norms — particularly in regard to their fashion choices. Additionally, advertising in fashion branding choices and its effectiveness has been examined in the context of Chinese male consumers&#x27; choices. Men interested in wearing luxury fashion brands were often more concerned with making sure their choices were visually representative of a more professional and refined person, as opposed to someone that simply looked tough or strong. This kind of focus on visual portrayals can also appear in media depictions. In the Japanese film &quot;Sooshokukeidanshi&quot;, one of the main characters is made to appear like more of an outsider than the other male characters because of his unique style choices being seen as less traditionally masculine than the cultural expectation is, in Japan.

=== Effects on youth ===
Adharsh Raj and Manash Pratim Goswami write that in India, young people often copy negative behaviors seen as being traditionally masculine in Bollywood films. Turkish young people can also fall prey to such negative media influence, According to Özlem Akkaya. In a 2018 study, young males often thought that the violent behavior displayed by the main character, &quot;Behzat&quot;, in the Turkish television crime series, &quot;Behzat Ç. Bir Ankara Polisiyesi&quot;, was relatable to what they already experienced in their own day to day lives (and therefore, saw violence as a seemingly reasonable thing to occur in the series).

=== Fatherhood ===
In the Global South, many societies still follow very patriarchal norms. Through media depictions and real-life scenarios, men are seen as being the head of the family — those that provide financially, have decision making power, and really are in charge. The image of the nuclear family being the societal norm is also ever-present in many places. When men are not able to fulfill that traditionally masculine, fatherly role, they may have a difficult time proving themselves as being worthy enough to have relationships with their children. In South Africa, for example, females often take on more of a culturally masculine role in providing for the household, due to the high percentage of absent fathers in some communities. Fathers&#x27; decision to desert the mother and their biological child is fairly common in South Africa, particularly with regard to those fathers who are younger and come from lower income families. They are often trying to provide for their own nuclear families and cannot also fulfill the cultural obligations commonly attached to fatherhood.

=== Efforts toward gender equality ===
While gender equality has not been achieved, changes are happening in regard to these commonly believed gender roles, particularly with gender justice work in the Global South. In New Delhi, India, males are more frequently becoming involved in this work, while also trying to remain mindful of how their privileged status as men affects the public perception of what they are doing. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, the tide is also turning, and men&#x27;s involvement in opposing violence against women is generally seen as being very positive, a good thing for all. However, there are some who still very much see conflict and violence against women as simply going hand in hand with those cultures.

Some want to shift the focus from specifically viewing females as the ones deserving of stronger rights to everyone deserving the opportunity to be viewed as an equal; however, this can create the potential for men to fall back into the mindset of &quot;male victimhood&quot;, as opposed to focusing on female oppression. Although gender equality is becoming a more acknowledged topic in South Africa, for instance, fathers would often rather still hold on to the more traditional gender roles – and pass those ideas down to their sons.

The International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) has also been developed and the results from countries in the Global South studied more in recent years. Although the survey indicated areas for further improvement, a significant recent finding comes in regard to men&#x27;s childhood upbringing and their attitudes surrounding gender equality. If men were raised seeing more equal division of household labor tasks, older female relatives working in non-traditional occupations, less violence toward females, etc., those behaviors and attitudes had a tendency to carry over into their adult lives, according to the survey.

A 2012 study found some evidence that youth have perhaps, inadvertently, made contributions toward greater acceptance of gender equality. Popular culture consumed by youth and those of lesser social status in East Asia, including manga, singing competitions, bands, and more are starting to showcase more modernized males that combine some stereotypically masculine and feminine aspects in their behaviors.

In South Africa, stricter governmental policies are being put into place regarding abuse and violence. Additionally, initiatives like the &quot;One Man Can&quot; program were formed, which aim to provide HIV prevention and an anti-violence program to men in the country. The &#x27;We Can End Violence against Women&#x27; campaign is another anti-violence initiative in Pakistan, developed by the Oxfam GB group in South Asia. In 2019, the program garnered much voluntary male participation in its gender equality work out of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

<text>Femininity (also called womanliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles generally associated with women and girls. Femininity can be understood as socially constructed, and there is also some evidence that some behaviors considered feminine are influenced by both cultural factors and biological factors. To what extent femininity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate. It is conceptually distinct from both the female biological sex and from womanhood, as all humans can exhibit feminine and masculine traits, regardless of sex and gender.

Traits traditionally cited as feminine include gracefulness, gentleness, empathy, humility, and sensitivity, though traits associated with femininity vary across societies and individuals, and are influenced by a variety of social and cultural factors.

==Overview and history==
Despite the terms &quot;femininity&quot; and &quot;masculinity&quot; being in common usage, there is little scientific agreement about what femininity and masculinity are. Among scholars, the concept of femininity has varying meanings.

Professor of English Tara Williams has suggested that modern notions of femininity in English-speaking society began during the medieval period at the time of the bubonic plague in the 1300s. Women in the Early Middle Ages were referred to simply within their traditional roles of maiden, wife, or widow. After the Black Death in England wiped out approximately half the population, traditional gender roles of wife and mother changed, and opportunities opened up for women in society. The words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; are first recorded in Chaucer around 1380.

In 1949, French intellectual Simone de Beauvoir wrote that &quot;no biological, psychological or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society&quot; and &quot;one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman&quot;. The idea was picked up in 1959 by Canadian-American sociologist Erving Goffman and in 1990 by American philosopher Judith Butler, who theorized that gender is not fixed or inherent but is rather a socially defined set of practices and traits that have, over time, grown to become labelled as feminine or masculine. Goffman argued that women are socialized to present themselves as &quot;precious, ornamental and fragile, uninstructed in and ill-suited for anything requiring muscular exertion&quot; and to project &quot;shyness, reserve and a display of frailty, fear and incompetence&quot;.

Scientific efforts to measure femininity and masculinity were pioneered by psychologists Lewis Terman and Catherine Cox Miles in the 1930s. Their &quot;M–F model&quot; was adopted by other researchers and psychologists. The model posited that femininity and masculinity were innate and enduring qualities, not easily measured, opposite to one another, and that imbalances between them led to mental disorders.

Alongside the women&#x27;s movement of the 1970s, researchers began to move away from the M–F model, developing an interest in androgyny. The Bem Sex Role Inventory and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire were developed to measure femininity and masculinity on separate scales. Using such tests, researchers found that the two dimensions varied independently of one another, casting doubt on the earlier view of femininity and masculinity as opposing qualities.

Second-wave feminists, influenced by de Beauvoir, believed that although biological differences between females and males were innate, the concepts of femininity and masculinity had been culturally constructed, with traits such as passivity and tenderness assigned to women and aggression and intelligence assigned to men. Girls, second-wave feminists said, were then socialized with toys, games, television, and school into conforming to feminine values and behaviors. In her significant 1963 book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, American feminist Betty Friedan wrote that the key to women&#x27;s subjugation lay in the social construction of femininity as childlike, passive, and dependent, and called for a &quot;drastic reshaping of the cultural image of femininity.&quot;

==Behavior and personality==

Traits such as nurturance, sensitivity, sweetness, supportiveness, gentleness, warmth, passivity, cooperativeness, expressiveness, modesty, humility, empathy, affection, tenderness, and being emotional, kind, helpful, devoted, and understanding have been cited as stereotypically feminine. The defining characteristics of femininity vary between and even within societies.

The relationship between feminine socialization and heterosexual relationships has been studied by scholars, as femininity is related to women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; sexual appeal to men and boys. Femininity is sometimes linked with sexual objectification. Sexual passiveness, or sexual receptivity, is sometimes considered feminine while sexual assertiveness and sexual desire are sometimes considered masculine.

Scholars have debated the extent to which gender identity and gender-specific behaviors are due to socialization versus biological factors. Social and biological influences are thought to be mutually interacting during development. Studies of prenatal androgen exposure have provided some evidence that femininity and masculinity are partly biologically determined. Other possible biological influences include evolution, genetics, epigenetics, and hormones (both during development and in adulthood).

In 1959, researchers such as John Money and Anke Ehrhardt proposed the prenatal hormone theory. Their research argues that sexual organs bathe the embryo with hormones in the womb, resulting in the birth of an individual with a distinctively male or female brain; this was suggested by some to &quot;predict future behavioral development in a masculine or feminine direction&quot;. This theory, however, has been criticized on theoretical and empirical grounds and remains controversial. In 2005, scientific research investigating sex differences in psychology showed that gender expectations and stereotype threat affect behavior, and a person&#x27;s gender identity can develop as early as three years of age. Money also argued that gender identity is formed during a child&#x27;s first three years.

People who exhibit a combination of both masculine and feminine characteristics are considered androgynous, and feminist philosophers have argued that gender ambiguity may blur gender classification. Modern conceptualizations of femininity also rely not just upon social constructions, but upon the individualized choices made by women.

Philosopher Mary Vetterling-Braggin argues that all characteristics associated with femininity arose from early human sexual encounters which were mainly male-forced and female-unwilling, because of male and female anatomical differences. Others, such as Carole Pateman, Ria Kloppenborg, and Wouter J. Hanegraaff, argue that the definition of femininity is the result of how females must behave in order to maintain a patriarchal social system.

In his 1998 book &quot;Masculinity and Femininity: the Taboo Dimension of National Cultures&quot;, Dutch psychologist and researcher Geert Hofstede wrote that only behaviors directly connected with procreation can, strictly speaking, be described as feminine or masculine, and yet every society worldwide recognizes many additional behaviors as more suitable to females than males, and vice versa. He describes these as relatively arbitrary choices mediated by cultural norms and traditions, identifying &quot;masculinity versus femininity&quot; as one of five basic dimensions in his theory of cultural dimensions. Hofstede describes as feminine behaviors including service, permissiveness, and benevolence, and describes as feminine those countries stressing equality, solidarity, quality of work-life, and the resolution of conflicts by compromise and negotiation.

In Carl Jung&#x27;s school of analytical psychology, the anima and animus are the two primary anthropomorphic archetypes of the unconscious mind. The anima and animus are described by Jung as elements of his theory of the collective unconscious, a domain of the unconscious that transcends the personal psyche. In the unconscious of the male, it finds expression as a feminine inner personality: anima; equivalently, in the unconscious of the female, it is expressed as a masculine inner personality: animus.

==Clothing and appearance==
In Western cultures, the ideal of feminine appearance has traditionally included long, flowing hair, clear skin, a narrow waist, and little or no body hair or facial hair. In other cultures, however, some expectations are different. For example, in many parts of the world, underarm hair is not considered unfeminine. Today, the color pink is strongly associated with femininity, whereas in the early 1900s pink was associated with boys and blue with girls.

These feminine ideals of beauty have been criticized as restrictive, unhealthy, and even racist. In particular, the prevalence of anorexia and other eating disorders in Western countries has frequently been blamed on the modern feminine ideal of thinness.

In many Muslim countries, women are required to cover their heads with a &quot;hijab&quot; (veil). It is considered a symbol of feminine modesty and morality. Some, however, see it as a symbol of objectification and oppression.

===In history===

Cultural standards vary on what is considered feminine. For example, in 16th century France, high heels were considered a distinctly masculine type of shoe, though they are currently considered feminine.

In Ancient Egypt, sheath and beaded net dresses were considered female clothing, while wraparound dresses, perfumes, cosmetics, and elaborate jewelry were worn by both men and women. In Ancient Persia, clothing was generally unisex, though women wore veils and headscarves. Women in Ancient Greece wore himations; and in Ancient Rome women wore the palla, a rectangular mantle, and the maphorion.

The typical feminine outfit of aristocratic women of the Renaissance was an undershirt with a gown and a high-waisted overgown, and a plucked forehead and beehive or turban-style hairdo.

===Body alteration===

Body alteration is the deliberate altering of the human body for aesthetic or non-medical purpose. One such purpose has been to induce perceived feminine characteristics in women.

For centuries in Imperial China, smaller feet were considered to be a more aristocratic characteristic in women. The practice of foot binding was intended to enhance this characteristic, though it made walking difficult and painful.

In a few parts of Africa and Asia, neck rings are worn in order to elongate the neck. In these cultures, a long neck characterizes feminine beauty. The Padaung of Burma and Tutsi women of Burundi, for instance, practice this form of body modification.

==Traditional roles==

Femininity as a social construct relies on a binary gender system that treats men and masculinity as different from, and opposite to, women and femininity. In patriarchal societies, including Western ones, conventional attitudes to femininity contribute to the subordination of women, as women are seen as more compliant, vulnerable, and less prone to violence.

Gender stereotypes influence traditional feminine occupations, resulting in microaggression toward women who break traditional gender roles. These stereotypes include that women have a caring nature, have skill at household-related work, have greater manual dexterity than men, are more honest than men, and have a more attractive physical appearance. Occupational roles associated with these stereotypes include: midwife, teacher, accountant, data entry clerk, cashier, salesperson, receptionist, housekeeper, cook, maid, social worker, and nurse. Occupational segregation maintains gender inequality and the gender pay gap. Certain medical specializations, such as surgery and emergency medicine, are dominated by a masculine culture and have a higher salary.

Leadership is associated with masculinity in Western culture and women are perceived less favorably as potential leaders. However, some people have argued that feminine-style leadership, which is associated with leadership that focuses on help and cooperation, is advantageous over masculine leadership, which is associated with focusing on tasks and control. Female leaders are more often described by Western media using characteristics associated with femininity, such as emotion.

=== Explanations for occupational imbalance ===
Psychologist Deborah L. Best argues that primary sex characteristics of men and women, such as the ability to bear children, caused a historical sexual division of labor and that gender stereotypes evolved culturally to perpetuate this division.

The practice of bearing children tends to interrupt the continuity of employment. According to human capital theory, this retracts from the female investment in higher education and employment training. Richard Anker of the International Labour Office argues human capital theory does not explain the sexual division of labor because many occupations tied to feminine roles, such as administrative assistance, require more knowledge, experience, and continuity of employment than low-skilled masculinized occupations, such as truck driving. Anker argues the feminization of certain occupations limits employment options for women.

====Role congruity theory====
Role congruity theory proposes that people tend to view deviations from expected gender roles negatively. It supports the empirical evidence that gender discrimination exists in areas traditionally associated with one gender or the other. It is sometimes used to explain why people have a tendency to evaluate behavior that fulfills the prescriptions of a leader role less favorably when it is enacted by a woman.

==Religion and politics==
===Asian religions===
Shamanism may have originated as early as the Paleolithic period, predating all organized religions. Archeological finds have suggested that the earliest known shamans were female, and contemporary shamanic roles such as the Korean mudang continue to be filled primarily by women.
In Hindu traditions, Devi is the female aspect of the divine. Shakti is the divine feminine creative power, the sacred force that moves through the entire universe and the agent of change. She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, the basic nature of intelligence by which the Universe exists and functions. In Hinduism, the universal creative force Yoni is feminine, with inspiration being the life force of creation.
In Taoism, the concept of &quot;yin&quot; represents the primary force of the female half of yin and yang. The yin is also present, to a smaller proportion, in the male half. The yin can be characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive.

===Abrahamic theology===

Although the Abrahamic God is typically described in masculine terms—such as &quot;father&quot; or &quot;king&quot;—many theologians argue that this is not meant to indicate the gender of God. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, God &quot;is neither man nor woman: he is God&quot;. Several recent writers, such as feminist theologian Sallie McFague, have explored the idea of &quot;God as mother&quot;, examining the feminine qualities attributed to God. For example, in the Book of Isaiah, God is compared to a mother comforting her child, while in the Book of Deuteronomy, God is said to have given birth to Israel.

The Book of Genesis describes the divine creation of the world out of nothing or ex nihilo. In Wisdom literature and in the wisdom tradition, &quot;wisdom&quot; is described as feminine. In many books of the Old Testament, including Wisdom and Sirach, wisdom is personified and called &quot;she&quot;. According to David Winston, because &quot;wisdom&quot; is God&#x27;s &quot;creative agent,&quot; she must be intimately identified with God.

&quot;The Wisdom of God&quot; is feminine in Hebrew: &quot;Chokmah&quot;, in Arabic: &quot;Hikmah&quot;, in Greek: &quot;Sophia&quot;, and in Latin: &quot;Sapientia&quot;. In Hebrew, both Shekhinah (the Holy Spirit and divine presence of God) and Ruach HaKodesh (divine inspiration) are feminine.

In Christian Kabbalah, Chokmah (wisdom and intuition) is the force in the creative process that God used to create the heavens and the earth. Binah (understanding and perception) is the great mother, the feminine receiver of energy and giver of form. Binah receives the intuitive insight from Chokmah and dwells on it in the same way that a mother receives the seed from the father, and keeps it within her until it&#x27;s time to give birth. The intuition, once received and contemplated with perception, leads to the creation of the Universe.

=== Communism ===

Communist revolutionaries initially depicted idealized womanhood as muscular, plainly dressed and strong, with good female communists shown as undertaking hard manual labour, using guns, and eschewing self-adornment. Contemporary Western journalists portrayed communist states as the enemy of traditional femininity, describing women in communist countries as &quot;mannish&quot; perversions. In revolutionary China in the 1950s, Western journalists described Chinese women as &quot;drably dressed, usually in sloppy slacks and without makeup, hair waves or nail polish&quot; and wrote that &quot;Glamour was communism&#x27;s earliest victim in China. You can stroll the cheerless streets of Peking all day, without seeing a skirt or a sign of lipstick; without thrilling to the faintest breath of perfume; without hearing the click of high heels, or catching the glint of legs sheathed in nylon.&quot; In communist Poland, changing from high heels to worker&#x27;s boots symbolized women&#x27;s shift from the bourgeois to socialism.&quot;

Later, the initial state portrayals of idealized femininity as strong and hard-working began to also include more traditional notions such as gentleness, caring and nurturing behaviour, softness, modesty and moral virtue, requiring good communist women to become &quot;superheroes who excelled in all spheres&quot;, including working at jobs not traditionally regarded as feminine in nature.

Communist ideology explicitly rejected some aspects of traditional femininity that it viewed as bourgeois and consumerist, such as helplessness, idleness and self-adornment. In Communist countries, some women resented not having access to cosmetics and fashionable clothes. In her 1993 book of essays &quot;How We Survived Communism &amp; Even Laughed&quot;, Croatian journalist and novelist Slavenka Drakulic wrote about &quot;a complaint I heard repeatedly from women in Warsaw, Budapest, Prague, Sofia, East Berlin: &#x27;Look at us – we don&#x27;t even look like women. There are no deodorants, perfumes, sometimes even no soap or toothpaste. There is no fine underwear, no pantyhose, no nice lingerie[&#x27;]&quot; and &quot;Sometimes I think the real Iron Curtain is made of silky, shiny images of pretty women dressed in wonderful clothes, of pictures from women&#x27;s magazines ... The images that cross the borders in magazines, movies or videos are therefore more dangerous than any secret weapon, because they make one desire that &#x27;otherness&#x27; badly enough to risk one&#x27;s life trying to escape.&quot; 

As communist countries such as Romania and the Soviet Union began to liberalize, their official media began representing women in more conventionally feminine ways compared with the &quot;rotund farm workers and plain-Jane factory hand&quot; depictions they had previously been publishing. As perfumes, cosmetics, fashionable clothing, and footwear became available to ordinary women in the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia and Hungary, they began to be presented not as bourgeois frivolities but as signs of socialist modernity. In China, with the economic liberation started by Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s, the state stopped discouraging women from expressing conventional femininity, and gender stereotypes and commercialized sexualization of women which had been suppressed under communist ideology began to rise.

==In men==
In many cultures, men who display qualities considered feminine are often stigmatized and labeled as weak. Effeminate men are often associated with homosexuality, although femininity is not necessarily related to a man&#x27;s sexual orientation. Because men are pressured to be masculine and heterosexual, feminine men are assumed to be gay or otherwise queer because of how they perform their gender. This assumption limits the way one is allowed to express one&#x27;s gender and sexuality.

Cross-dressing and drag are two public performances of femininity by men that have been popularly known and understood throughout many western cultures. Men who wear clothing associated with femininity are often called cross-dressers. A drag queen is a man who wears flamboyant women&#x27;s clothing and behaves in an exaggeratedly feminine manner for entertainment purposes.

==Feminist views==
Feminist philosophers such as Judith Butler and Simone de Beauvoir contend that femininity and masculinity are created through repeated performances of gender; these performances reproduce and define the traditional categories of sex and/or gender.

Many second-wave feminists reject what they regard as constricting standards of female beauty, created for the subordination and objectifying of women and self-perpetuated by reproductive competition and women&#x27;s own aesthetics.

Others, such as lipstick feminists and some other third-wave feminists, argue that feminism should not devalue feminine culture and identity, and that symbols of feminine identity such as make-up, suggestive clothing and having a sexual allure can be valid and empowering personal choices for both sexes.

Julia Serano notes that masculine girls and women face much less social disapproval than feminine boys and men, which she attributes to sexism. Serano argues that women wanting to be like men is consistent with the idea that maleness is more valued in contemporary culture than femaleness, whereas men being willing to give up masculinity in favour of femininity directly threatens the notion of male superiority as well as the idea that men and women should be opposites. To support her thesis, Serano cites the far greater public scrutiny and disdain experienced by male-to-female cross-dressers compared with that faced by women who dress in masculine clothes, as well as research showing that parents are likelier to respond negatively to sons who like Barbie dolls and ballet or wear nail polish than they are to daughters exhibiting comparably masculine behaviours. Serano notes that some behaviors, such as frequent smiling or avoiding eye contact with strangers, are considered feminine because they are practised disproportionately by women, and likely have resulted from women&#x27;s attempts to negotiate through a world which is sometimes hostile to them.

<text>A regulatory sequence is a segment of a nucleic acid molecule which is capable of increasing or decreasing the expression of specific genes within an organism. Regulation of gene expression is an essential feature of all living organisms and viruses.

==Description==

In DNA, regulation of gene expression normally happens at the level of RNA biosynthesis (transcription). It is accomplished through the sequence-specific binding of proteins (transcription factors) that activate or inhibit transcription. Transcription factors may act as activators, repressors, or both. Repressors often act by preventing RNA polymerase from forming a productive complex with the transcriptional initiation region (promoter), while activators facilitate formation of a productive complex. Furthermore, DNA motifs have been shown to be predictive of epigenomic modifications, suggesting that transcription factors play a role in regulating the epigenome.

In RNA, regulation may occur at the level of protein biosynthesis (translation), RNA cleavage, RNA splicing, or transcriptional termination. Regulatory sequences are frequently associated with messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, where they are used to control mRNA biogenesis or translation. A variety of biological molecules may bind to the RNA to accomplish this regulation, including proteins (e.g., translational repressors and splicing factors), other RNA molecules (e.g., miRNA) and small molecules, in the case of riboswitches.

==Activation and implementation==

A regulatory DNA sequence does not regulate unless it is activated. Different regulatory sequences are activated and then implement their regulation by different mechanisms.

===Enhancer activation and implementation===

Expression of genes in mammals can be upregulated when signals are transmitted to the promoters associated with the genes. &quot;Cis&quot;-regulatory DNA sequences that are located in DNA regions distant from the promoters of genes can have very large effects on gene expression, with some genes undergoing up to 100-fold increased expression due to such a &quot;cis&quot;-regulatory sequence. These &quot;cis&quot;-regulatory sequences include enhancers, silencers, insulators and tethering elements. Among this constellation of sequences, enhancers and their associated transcription factor proteins have a leading role in the regulation of gene expression.

Enhancers are sequences of the genome that are major gene-regulatory elements. Enhancers control cell-type-specific gene expression programs, most often by looping through long distances to come in physical proximity with the promoters of their target genes. In a study of brain cortical neurons, 24,937 loops were found, bringing enhancers to promoters. Multiple enhancers, each often at tens or hundred of thousands of nucleotides distant from their target genes, loop to their target gene promoters and coordinate with each other to control expression of their common target gene.

The schematic illustration in this section shows an enhancer looping around to come into close physical proximity with the promoter of a target gene. The loop is stabilized by a dimer of a connector protein (e.g. dimer of CTCF or YY1), with one member of the dimer anchored to its binding motif on the enhancer and the other member anchored to its binding motif on the promoter (represented by the red zigzags in the illustration). Several cell function specific transcription factor proteins (in 2018 Lambert et al. indicated there were about 1,600 transcription factors in a human cell) generally bind to specific motifs on an enhancer and a small combination of these enhancer-bound transcription factors, when brought close to a promoter by a DNA loop, govern the level of transcription of the target gene. Mediator (coactivator) (a complex usually consisting of about 26 proteins in an interacting structure) communicates regulatory signals from enhancer DNA-bound transcription factors directly to the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) enzyme bound to the promoter.

Enhancers, when active, are generally transcribed from both strands of DNA with RNA polymerases acting in two different directions, producing two eRNAs as illustrated in the Figure. An inactive enhancer may be bound by an inactive transcription factor. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor may activate it and that activated transcription factor may then activate the enhancer to which it is bound (see small red star representing phosphorylation of a transcription factor bound to an enhancer in the illustration). An activated enhancer begins transcription of its RNA before activating a promoter to initiate transcription of messenger RNA from its target gene.

===CpG island methylation and demethylation===

5-Methylcytosine (5-mC) is a methylated form of the DNA base cytosine (see figure). 5-mC is an epigenetic marker found predominantly on cytosines within CpG dinucleotides, which consist of a cytosine is followed by a guanine reading in the 5′ to 3′ direction along the DNA strand (CpG sites). About 28 million CpG dinucleotides occur in the human genome. In most tissues of mammals, on average, 70% to 80% of CpG cytosines are methylated (forming 5-methyl-CpG, or 5-mCpG). Methylated cytosines within CpG sequences often occur in groups, called CpG islands. About 59% of promoter sequences have a CpG island while only about 6% of enhancer sequences have a CpG island. CpG islands constitute regulatory sequences, since if CpG islands are methylated in the promoter of a gene this can reduce or silence gene expression.

DNA methylation regulates gene expression through interaction with methyl binding domain (MBD) proteins, such as MeCP2, MBD1 and MBD2. These MBD proteins bind most strongly to highly methylated CpG islands. These MBD proteins have both a methyl-CpG-binding domain and a transcriptional repression domain. They bind to methylated DNA and guide or direct protein complexes with chromatin remodeling and/or histone modifying activity to methylated CpG islands. MBD proteins generally repress local chromatin by means such as catalyzing the introduction of repressive histone marks or creating an overall repressive chromatin environment through nucleosome remodeling and chromatin reorganization.

Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences in order to regulate the expression of a given gene. The binding sequence for a transcription factor in DNA is usually about 10 or 11 nucleotides long. There are approximately 1,400 different transcription factors encoded in the human genome and they constitute about 6% of all human protein coding genes. About 94% of transcription factor binding sites that are associated with signal-responsive genes occur in enhancers while only about 6% of such sites occur in promoters.

EGR1 is a transcription factor important for regulation of methylation of CpG islands. An EGR1 transcription factor binding site is frequently located in enhancer or promoter sequences. There are about 12,000 binding sites for EGR1 in the mammalian genome and about half of EGR1 binding sites are located in promoters and half in enhancers. The binding of EGR1 to its target DNA binding site is insensitive to cytosine methylation in the DNA.

While only small amounts of EGR1 protein are detectable in cells that are un-stimulated, EGR1 translation into protein at one hour after stimulation is markedly elevated. Expression of EGR1 in various types of cells can be stimulated by growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, stress and injury. In the brain, when neurons are activated, EGR1 proteins are upregulated, and they bind to (recruit) pre-existing TET1 enzymes, which are highly expressed in neurons. TET enzymes can catalyze demethylation of 5-methylcytosine. When EGR1 transcription factors bring TET1 enzymes to EGR1 binding sites in promoters, the TET enzymes can demethylate the methylated CpG islands at those promoters. Upon demethylation, these promoters can then initiate transcription of their target genes. Hundreds of genes in neurons are differentially expressed after neuron activation through EGR1 recruitment of TET1 to methylated regulatory sequences in their promoters.

===Activation by double- or single-strand breaks===
About 600 regulatory sequences in promoters and about 800 regulatory sequences in enhancers appear to depend on double-strand breaks initiated by topoisomerase 2β (TOP2B) for activation. The induction of particular double-strand breaks is specific with respect to the inducing signal. When neurons are activated &quot;in vitro&quot;, just 22 TOP2B-induced double-strand breaks occur in their genomes. However, when contextual fear conditioning is carried out in a mouse, this conditioning causes hundreds of gene-associated DSBs in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which are important for learning and memory.

Such TOP2B-induced double-strand breaks are accompanied by at least four enzymes of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway (DNA-PKcs, KU70, KU80 and DNA LIGASE IV) (see figure). These enzymes repair the double-strand breaks within about 15 minutes to 2 hours. The double-strand breaks in the promoter are thus associated with TOP2B and at least these four repair enzymes. These proteins are present simultaneously on a single promoter nucleosome (there are about 147 nucleotides in the DNA sequence wrapped around a single nucleosome) located near the transcription start site of their target gene.

The double-strand break introduced by TOP2B apparently frees the part of the promoter at an RNA polymerase–bound transcription start site to physically move to its associated enhancer. This allows the enhancer, with its bound transcription factors and mediator proteins, to directly interact with the RNA polymerase that had been paused at the transcription start site to start transcription.

Similarly, topoisomerase I (TOP1) enzymes appear to be located at many enhancers, and those enhancers become activated when TOP1 introduces a single-strand break. TOP1 causes single-strand breaks in particular enhancer DNA regulatory sequences when signaled by a specific enhancer-binding transcription factor. Topoisomerase I breaks are associated with different DNA repair factors than those surrounding TOP2B breaks. In the case of TOP1, the breaks are associated most immediately with DNA repair enzymes MRE11, RAD50 and ATR.

<doc id="240071" wikidata="Q1517749" url="?curid=240071" title="Battle of the Winwaed">
<text>The Battle of the Winwaed (Welsh: &quot;Maes Gai&quot;; ) was fought on 15 November 655 between King Penda of Mercia and Oswiu of Bernicia, ending in the Mercians&#x27; defeat and Penda&#x27;s death. According to Bede, the battle marked the effective demise of Anglo-Saxon paganism.

==Background==

The roots of the battle lay in Penda&#x27;s success in dominating England through a number of military victories, most significantly over the previously dominant Northumbrians. In alliance with Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd he had defeated and killed Edwin of Northumbria at Hatfield Chase in 633, and subsequently he defeated and killed Oswald of Northumbria at the Battle of Maserfield in 642. Maserfield effectively marked the overthrow of Northumbrian supremacy, and in the years that followed the Mercians apparently campaigned into Bernicia, besieging Bamburgh at one point; the Northumbrian sub-kingdom of Deira supported Penda during his 655 invasion.

==Toponymy, location, and date==
Since the nineteenth century, &quot;winwœd&quot; or &quot;winwæd&quot; was interpreted as an Old English name, from the elements &quot;&quot; (&quot;strife&quot;, &quot;fight&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;shallow water&quot;, &quot;ford&quot;). In 2004, however, Andrew Breeze reinterpreted the name with a Celtic etymology, corresponding to Modern Welsh &quot;gwenwedd&quot; (&#x27;whiteness&#x27;). Meanwhile, the &quot;campus Gai&quot; (Latin) or &quot;maes Gai&quot; (Welsh) of the Welsh sources means &#x27;Caius&#x27;s field&#x27;).

Although the battle is said to be the most important between the early northern and southern divisions of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain, few details are available. The two armies met near a river named the &quot;Winwæd&quot;, but this river has never been identified. Since, after the battle, Oswiu concludes his campaign in the district of &quot;Loidis&quot; (which gives its name to the modern West Yorkshire city of Leeds), the Winwæd is usually thought to have been near Leeds and/or a tributary of the Humber. Andrew Breeze argued for the River Went, a tributary of the River Don, situated to the north of modern-day Doncaster. Other identifications include the river now known as Cock Beck, Leeds (which has inspired the modern housing estate name Pendas Fields), before joining the River Wharfe (which eventually feeds into the Humber). Wilder speculations include Oswestry or Winwick.

After his account of the battle and the monastic endowments made by Oswiu in thanks to God for his victory, Bede says that King Oswiu brought the campaign to a close in the district of Loidis (Leeds) on 15 November in the thirteenth year of his reign, to the great benefit of both peoples; for he freed his own subjects from the hostile devastations of the heathen people and converted the Mercians and the neighbouring kingdoms to a state of grace in the Christian faith, having destroyed their heathen ruler. This has traditionally been seen as evidence that the Battle of the Winwæd itself took place on 15 November 655, but Philip Dunshea has argued that Bede&#x27;s phrasing makes it possible that the battle could have happened some time—even years—before Oswiu &#x27;brought the campaign to a close&#x27;, and that its location could have been far from Leeds.

==Battle==
Penda, after gathering allies from East Anglia and Wales, marched with a force led by &quot;thirty warlords&quot;. Oswiu, who was Oswald&#x27;s brother but had succeeded him only in Bernicia, the northern part of Northumbria, was besieged by Penda&#x27;s forces at a place called &quot;Urbs Iudeu&quot; (which has been identified, perhaps dubiously, with Stirling) in the north of his kingdom. &quot;Iedeu&quot; appears as a historic name for Jedburgh, also located in the north of the kingdom. Apparently Oswiu was desperate enough to offer a great deal of treasure to Penda in exchange for peace. Although the sources are unclear, it is likely that some sort of agreement was reached at &quot;Iudeu&quot;: although Bede says that Oswiu&#x27;s offers of treasure were rejected by Penda, who, Bede says, was determined to destroy Oswiu&#x27;s people &quot;from the highest to the lowest&quot;, he does mention that Oswiu&#x27;s young son Ecgfrith was being held hostage by the Mercians, perhaps as part of a deal. 

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; contradicts Bede regarding the treasure, saying that Penda distributed it among his British allies, which would presumably mean that he accepted it. The recorded events may be interpreted to mean that Penda and his army then began marching home, but for some reason the two armies met and fought at a place called the River &quot;Winwaed&quot;. Breeze argues that Penda and his army would have been in a difficult strategic location along the Went during their withdrawal, giving Oswiu a good opportunity to attack. 

It is almost certain that the small (&quot;perparvus&quot;, according to Bede) Northumbrian forces were considerably outnumbered by the Mercians and their allies. According to Bede, before the battle Oswiu prayed to God and promised to make his daughter a nun and grant twelve estates for the construction of monasteries if he was victorious.

Penda&#x27;s army was apparently weakened by desertions. According to the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, Penda&#x27;s ally Cadafael ap Cynfeddw of Gwynedd (thereafter remembered as Cadomedd, &quot;battle-shirker&quot;) abandoned him, along with his army, and Bede says that Aethelwald of Deira withdrew from the battle to await the outcome from a place of safety. Penda was soundly defeated, and both he and his ally, the East Anglian King Aethelhere, were killed, with thirty allied leaders of warbands (&quot;duces regii&quot;). The battle was fought by the river in the midst of heavy rains, and Bede says that &quot;many more were drowned in the flight than destroyed by the sword&quot;. Bede mentions that Penda&#x27;s head was cut off. Writing in the 12th century, Henry of Huntingdon expanded his version of Bede&#x27;s text to include supernatural intervention and remarked that Penda, in dying violently on the battlefield, was suffering the same fate he had inflicted on others during his aggressive reign.

==Aftermath==
The battle had a substantial effect on the relative positions of Northumbria and Mercia. Mercia&#x27;s position of dominance, established after the battle of Maserfield, was destroyed, and Northumbrian dominance was restored; Mercia itself was divided, with the northern part being taken by Oswiu outright and the southern part going to Penda&#x27;s Christian son Peada, who had married into the Bernician royal line (although Peada survived only until his murder in 656). Northumbrian authority over Mercia was overthrown within a few years, however.

Significantly, the battle marked the effective demise of Anglo-Saxon paganism; Charles Plummer, in 1896, described it as &quot;decisive as to the religious destiny of the English&quot;. Penda had continued in his traditional paganism despite the widespread conversions of Anglo-Saxon monarchs to Christianity, and a number of Christian kings had suffered death in defeat against him; after Penda&#x27;s death, Mercia was converted, and all the kings who ruled thereafter (including Penda&#x27;s sons Peada, Wulfhere and Æthelred) were Christian.

<text>Media literacy is an expanded conceptualization of literacy that includes the ability to access and analyze media messages, as well as create, reflect and take action—using the power of information and communication—to make a difference in the world. Media literacy applies to different types of media, and is seen as an important skill for work, life, and citizenship.

Examples of media literacy include reflecting on one&#x27;s media choices, identifying sponsored content, recognizing stereotypes, analyzing propaganda and discussing the benefits, risks, and harms of media use. Critical analysis skills can be developed through practices like constructivist media decoding and lateral reading, which entails looking at multiple perspectives in assessing the quality of a particular piece of media. Media literacy also includes the ability to create and share messages as a socially responsible communicator, and the practices of safety and civility, information access, and civic voice and engagement are sometimes referred to as digital citizenship. 

Media literacy education is the process used to advance media literacy competencies, and it is intended to promote awareness of media influence and create an active stance towards both consuming and creating media. Media literacy education is taught and studied in many countries around the world. Finland has been cited as one of the leading countries that invests significantly in media literacy.

==Media literacy education==
Education for media literacy often encourages people to ask questions about what they watch, hear, and read. Some examples of media examined include, but are not limited to television, video games, photographs, and audio messages.

Media literacy education provides tools to help people develop receptive media capability to critically analyze messages, offers opportunities for learners to broaden their experience of media, and helps them develop generative media capability to increase creative skills in making their own media messages. Critical analyses can include identifying author, purpose and point of view, examining construction techniques and genres, examining patterns of media representation, and detecting propaganda, censorship, and bias in news and public affairs programming (and the reasons for these). Media literacy education may explore how structural features—such as media ownership, or its funding model—affect the information presented. Media Literacy is interdisciplinary by nature. Media literacy represents a necessary, inevitable, and realistic response to the complex, ever-changing electronic environment and communication cornucopia surrounding us. 

Goals might include developing the habits and skills to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act using all forms of communication. Education about media literacy can begin in early childhood by developing a pedagogy around more critical thinking and deeper analysis and questioning of concepts and texts. As students age and enter adulthood, the use of learning media literacy will be impactful in identifying ethical and technical standards in media as well as understanding how media ties to their cognitive, social, and emotional needs.

In North America and Europe, media literacy includes both empowerment and protectionist perspectives. Media literate people can skillfully create and produce media messages, both to show understanding of the specific qualities of each medium, as well as to create media and participate as active citizens. Media literacy can be seen as contributing to an expanded conceptualization of literacy, treating mass media, popular culture and digital media as new types of &#x27;texts&#x27; that require analysis and evaluation. By transforming the process of media consumption into an active and critical process, people gain greater awareness of the potential for misrepresentation and manipulation, and understand the role of mass media and participatory media in constructing views of reality.

Media literacy education is sometimes conceptualized as a way to address the negative dimensions of media, including media manipulation, misinformation, gender and racial stereotypes and violence, the sexualization of children, and concerns about loss of privacy, cyberbullying and Internet predators. By building knowledge and competencies in using media and technology, media literacy education may provide a type of protection to children and young people by helping them make good choices in their media consumption habits, and patterns of usage.

This pedagogical project questions representations of class, gender, race, sexuality and other forms of identity and challenges media messages that reproduce oppression and discrimination. Proponents of media literacy education argue that the inclusion of media literacy into school curricula promotes civic engagement, increases awareness of the power structures inherent in popular media and aids students in gaining necessary critical and inquiry skills. Media can have a positive or negative impact on society, but media literacy education enables the students to discern inescapable risks of manipulation, propaganda and media bias. A growing body of research has begun focusing on the impact of media literacy on youth. In an important meta-analysis of more than 50 studies, published in the &quot;Journal of Communication&quot;, media literacy interventions were found to have positive effects on knowledge, criticism, perceived realism, influence, behavioral beliefs, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior. Media literacy also encourages critical thinking and self-expression, enabling citizens to decisively exercise their democratic rights. Media literacy enables the populace to understand and contribute to public discourse, and, eventually, make sound decisions when electing their leaders. People who are media literate can adopt a critical stance when decoding media messages, no matter their views regarding a position. Likewise, the use of mobile devices by children and adolescents is increasing significantly; therefore, it is relevant to investigate the level of advertising literacy of parents who interact as mediators between children and mobile advertising.

Digitalisation and the expansion of information and communication technologies at the beginning of the 21st century have substantially modified the media and their relationship with users, which logically modifies the basic principles of media education. It is no longer so much a question of educating critical receivers as of training citizens as responsible prosumers in virtual and hybrid environments. Media education currently incorporates phenomena such as social networks, virtual communities, big data, artificial intelligence, cyber-surveillance, etc., as well as training the individual in the critical use of mobile devices of all kinds.

== Media literacy policy ==
Educators have identified some important components that should be present in &quot;quality&quot; media literacy education programs. These include: (1) attention to teaching methods; (2) the training and preparation of educators; (3) the scope, structure, and coherence of the activities of instructional practice; (4) the presence and appropriateness of underlying theories of media literacy; and (5) the originality of the programs in relation to available resources and community needs. 

In the United States, education policy is decentralized, and reference to media literacy is growing, with 22 passed bills in 14 states since 2012. Most state policies do not allocate financial resources to promote media literacy education, with only a few providing staff positions or coaching. While most policies make reference to resources for media literacy education, these generally refer to lists of curriculum materials or sample instructional material.

== Theoretical approaches to media literacy education ==
Theoretical frameworks for media literacy are rooted in interdisciplinary work at the intersection of communication and media studies, education, and the humanities. Key concepts and core principles have been synthesized from the work of 20th century thinkers and scholars who have been called grandparents of media literacy, such as Paolo Freire, Marshall McLuhan, Stuart Hall, and others.

=== Information Literacy ===
With the growing problem of so-called &quot;fake news,&quot; Mike Caulfield and Sam Wineburg adapt an approach to fact checking as a type of media literacy, suggesting that information seekers emphasize lateral reading, including starting some searches on Wikipedia. Instead of &quot;vertical reading&quot; of a single website, &quot;lateral reading&quot;, is a fact-checking method to find and compare multiple sources of information on the same topic or event. The method they suggest is called &#x27;SIFT.&#x27; &#x27;S&#x27; is for stop and reflect, especially before sharing or acting on the information. &#x27;I&#x27; is for investigate the source. Looking at the source&#x27;s Wikipedia page, for example, can sometimes a give a sense of their reliability. &#x27;F&#x27; is for find better coverage, such as a reputable fact-checking website. &#x27;T&#x27; is for trace the claim to its original context, whether an image or a quote to help make sure it was not taken out of context or comes from a reliable source.

=== Literacy ===
Other approaches focus on positioning media literacy in relation to &quot;reading,&quot; &quot;writing,&quot; and &quot;relevance.&quot; Renee Hobbs developed the AACRA model (access, analyze, create, reflect and act) and identifies three frames for introducing media literacy to learners: authors and audiences (AA), messages and meanings (MM), and representation and reality (RR), synthesizing the scholarly literature from media literacy, information literacy, visual literacy and new literacies.

=== Communication ===
Some theoretical frames make reference to the key elements of human communication. David Buckingham proposed: Production, Language, Representation, and Audience. Elaborating on the concepts presented by David Buckingham, Henry Jenkins discusses the emergence of a participatory culture and stresses the significance of &quot;new media literacies&quot;—a set of cultural competencies and social skills that young people need in the new media landscape.

=== Power ===
Other theoretical approaches, like critical media literacy, emphasize the power relationships that are inherent in media systems in society. Critical media literacy aims to analyze and understand the power structures that shape media representations and the ways in which audiences work to make meaning through dominant, oppositional and negotiated readings of media.

=== Effects ===
There is also an approach to media literacy that is rooted in media psychology and media effects. This is sometimes called a protectionist approach to media literacy because it aims to educate students about potential risks and harms of media use. This approach views children and young people as particularly vulnerable to cultural, ideological or moral influences, and needing protection by means of education.

=== Arts ===
The media arts education tradition focuses on creative production of different media forms by learners. This approach is one of the oldest approaches to media literacy education and was pioneered by educators and artists in Rochester, New York who developed visual literacy in education. 

=== Research on media literacy education ===
The scholarly knowledge community publishes research in the &quot;Journal of Media Literacy Education&quot; and other journals, and a robust global community of media literacy scholars has emerged since the European Commission set an ambitious objective for Europe to advance its knowledge economy while being more culturally inclusive. Empirical research on media literacy education is carried out by social science researchers generally falls into three major categories, focusing on (a) health outcomes; (b) curriculum and instruction; and (c) political attitudes, media use and behavior.

Meta-analysis of a large number of these studies has found that the average effect size was strong and positive for outcomes including media knowledge, criticism, perceived realism, influence, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior. In two recent nationally-representative surveys of U.S. residents, media literacy competencies were associated with health-related decision making in the context of COVID-19, and the study found that media literacy skills promote the adoption of recommended health behaviors. Health interventions have also explored issues such as media violence, stereotypes in the representation of gender and race, materialism and consumer culture, and the glamorization of unhealthy behavior, including smoking. Research shows that media literacy is associated with increased resilience in children and youth that is effective in a wide variety of contexts and learning environments.

Media literacy competencies are frequently measured using self-report measures, where people rate or agree with various statements. These measures are easy to administer to a large group of people. Some researchers use performance- or competency-based measures to examine people&#x27;s actual ability to critically analyze news, advertising, or entertainment. Media literacy programs that focus on political attitudes and behavior are thought to provide the cognitive and social scaffolding needed for civic engagement. Research on high school students has shown that participation in a media literacy program was positively associated with information-seeking motives, media knowledge, and news analysis skills. Experimental research has shown that young people ages 15 – 27 who had received media literacy education in schools were better able to evaluate the accuracy of political content, even when it aligned with their existing political beliefs. Study shows that MLA training does impact public when it comes to figuring out fake news or any sort of disinformation or misinformation. Participants who were given MLA training, 73.3 percent were able to identify information which was fake. Nearly 70% agreed upon not sharing any inaccurate information online which was not accurate.

==History and international applications==
UNESCO has investigated which countries were incorporating media studies into different schools&#x27; curricula as a means to develop new initiatives in the field of media education. Relying on 72 experts on media education in 52 countries around the world, the study identified that (1) media literacy occurs inside the context of formal education; (2) it generally relies of partnerships with media industries and media regulators; and (3) there is a robust research community who have examined the needs of educators and obstacles to future development. Although progress around the world was uneven, all respondents realized the importance of media education, as well as the need for formal recognition from their government and policymakers.

In recent years, a wide variety of media literacy education initiatives have increased collaboration in Europe and North America, Many cultural, social, and political factors shape how media literacy education initiatives are believed to be significant. Mind Over Media is one example of an international collaboration in media literacy education: it is a digital learning platform that relies on crowdsourced examples of contemporary propaganda shared by educators and learners from around the world. For educators who are developing media literacy programs, the study of propaganda has become increasingly important, especially with the rise of fake news and disinformation.

One ranking of media literacy efforts had Finland #1, Canada #7 and the United States #18.

===North America===
In North America, the beginnings of a formalized approach to media literacy as a topic of education is often attributed to the 1978 formation of the Ontario-based Association for Media Literacy (AML). Before that time, instruction in media education was usually the purview of individual teachers and practitioners.

==== Canada ====
Canada was the first country in North America to require media literacy in the school curriculum. Every province has mandated media education in its curriculum. For example, the new curriculum of Quebec mandates media literacy from Grade 1 until final year of secondary school (Secondary V). The launching of media education in Canada came about for two reasons. One reason was the concern about the pervasiveness of American popular culture and the other was the education system-driven necessity of contexts for new educational paradigms. Canadian communication scholar Marshall McLuhan ignited the North American educational movement for media literacy in the 1950s and 1960s. Two of Canada&#x27;s leaders in Media Literacy and Media Education are Barry Duncan and John Pungente. Duncan died on June 6, 2012. Even after he retired from classroom teaching, Barry had still been active in media education. Pungente is a Jesuit priest who has promoted media literacy since the early 1960s.

==== United States ====
Media literacy education has been an interest in the United States since the early 20th century, when high school English teachers first started using film to develop students&#x27; critical thinking and communication skills. However, media literacy education is distinct from simply using media and technology in the classroom, a distinction that is exemplified by the difference between &quot;teaching with media&quot; and &quot;teaching about media.&quot; In the 1950s and 60s, the ‘film grammar’ approach to media literacy education developed in the United States. Where educators began to show commercial films to children, having them learn a new terminology consisting of words such as: fade, dissolve, truck, pan, zoom, and cut. Films were connected to literature and history. To understand the constructed nature of film, students explored plot development, character, mood and tone.

Then, during the 1970s and 1980s, attitudes about mass media and mass culture began to shift around the English-speaking world. Educators began to realize the need to &quot;guard against our prejudice of thinking of print as the only real medium that the English teacher has a stake in.&quot; A whole generation of educators began to not only acknowledge film and television as new, legitimate forms of expression and communication, but also explored practical ways to promote serious inquiry and analysis—- in higher education, in the family, in schools and in society. In 1976, Project Censored began using a service learning model to cultivate media literacy skills among students and faculty in higher education.

Media literacy education began to appear in state English education curriculum frameworks by the early 1990s, as a result of increased awareness in the central role of media in the context of contemporary culture. Nearly all 50 states have language that supports media literacy in state curriculum frameworks. Additionally, an increasing number of school districts have begun to develop school-wide programs, elective courses, and other after-school opportunities for media analysis and production. Media education for teachers, as of 2015, represented 2% of all study programs in teacher training.

Founded in 2008, the News Literacy Project initially offered curricular materials and other resources for educators who taught U.S. students in grades 6–12 (middle school and high school), focusing primarily on helping students learn to sort fact from fiction in the digital age. (In 2020 NLP expanded its work to include audiences of all ages and made all of its resources free of charge.) Similar programs for students and adults are also offered by the Poynter Institute (MediaWise) and the Stanford History Education Group at Stanford University (Civic Online Reasoning). Assessments of students who have taken such programs and those who have not have shown that the students with media literacy training can more easily recognize false or misleading content and determine whether a source of information is credible.

18 states have enacted media literacy standards in K-12 education as of 2023, including Texas, New Jersey, Delaware, Florida and California. In 2021, Illinois became the first state to require high school students to take a news literacy class.

===Europe===
The UK is widely regarded as a leader in the development of media literacy education. Key agencies that have been involved in this development include the British Film Institute, the English and Media Centre Film Education the Centre for the Study of Children, Youth and Media at the Institute of Education, London, and the DARE centre (Digital Arts Research Education), a collaboration between University College London and the British Film Institute. The ‘promotion&#x27; of media literacy also became a UK Government policy under New Labour, and was enshrined in the Communications Act 2003 as a responsibility of the new media regulator, Ofcom. After an initial burst of activity, however, Ofcom&#x27;s work in this regard was progressively reduced in scope, and from the Coalition government onwards, the promotion of media literacy was reduced to a matter of market research – what Wallis &amp; Buckingham have described as an ‘undead&#x27; policy.

In the Nordics, media education was introduced into the Finnish elementary curriculum in 1970 and into high schools in 1977. The concepts devised at the Lycée franco-finlandais d&#x27;Helsinki became the standard nation-wide in 2016. Finland also offers education for older adults as well.

France has taught film from the inception of the medium, but it has only been recently that conferences and media courses for teachers have been organized with the inclusion of media production.

Germany saw theoretical publications on media literacy in the 1970s and 1980s, with a growing interest for media education inside and outside the educational system in the 80s and 90s.

In the Netherlands media literacy was placed in the agenda by the Dutch government in 2006 as an important subject for the Dutch society. In April, 2008, an official center has been created (mediawijsheid expertisecentrum = medialiteracy expertisecenter) by the Dutch government. This center is a network organization consisting of different stakeholders with expertise on the subject.

In Russia, the 1970s-1990s brought about the first official programs of film and media education, increasing interest in doctoral studies focused on media education, as well as theoretical and empirical work on media education by O.Baranov (Tver), S.Penzin (Voronezh), G.Polichko, U.Rabinovich (Kurgan), Y.Usov (Moscow), Alexander Fedorov (Taganrog), A.Sharikov (Moscow) and others. Recent developments in media education in Russia are the 2002 registration of a new ‘Media Education’ (No. 03.13.30) specialization for the pedagogical universities, and the 2005 launch of the &quot;Media Education&quot; academic journal, partly sponsored by the ICOS UNESCO ‘Information for All’.

Montenegro became one of the few countries in the world that have introduced media education into their curriculums, when in 2009 “media literacy” was introduced as an optional subject for 16 and 17-year-old students of Gymnasium high schools.

In Ukraine, media education is in the second stage (2017–2020) of development and standardization. Main centres of media education include the Ivan Franko University of Lviv (led by Borys Potyatynyk), Institute of Higher Education of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine (Hanna Onkovych), Institute of Social and Political Psychology of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine (Lyubov Naidyonova).

In Spanish legislation, digital competence is considered as an umbrella term that &quot;includes information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, media education, digital content creation (including programming), security (including digital wellbeing and cybersecurity skills), digital citizenship issues, privacy, intellectual property, problem solving, and computational and critical thinking&quot;.

===Asia===
Media literacy education is not yet as widespread or as advanced in Asia, comparative to the U.S. or Western countries. Beginning in the 1990s, there has been a shift towards media literacy in East Asia. In recent years, media literacy education is growing in Asia, with several programs in place across countries throughout the Asian Pacific region.

Studies have been done to test levels of media literacy among Chinese-speaking students in Taiwan. Beginning in the 2017 school year, children in Taiwan study a new curriculum designed to teach critical reading of propaganda and the evaluation of sources. Called &quot;media literacy,&quot; the course provides training in journalism in the new information society.

In India, the Cybermohalla program started in 2001 with the aim to bring access to technology to youths.

In Vietnam, the Young Journalists Group (YOJO) was created in 1998 in collaboration with UNICEF and the Vietnamese National Radio to combat false accounts by the media.

In Singapore, the Media Development Authority (MDA) defines media literacy and recognizes it as an important tool for the 21st century, but only from the reading aspect of the term.

===Middle East===
According to the government-owned The Jordan Times, Jordan, has been moving forward in fostering media and information literacy, which is crucial to fighting extremism and hate speech, Jordan Media Institute has worked on spreading the concepts and skills of positive interaction with the media and tools of communication technology and digital media, and to reduce their disadvantages.
An academy in Beirut, Lebanon opened in 2013, called the Media and Digital Literacy Academy of Beirut (MDLAB) with the goal for students to be critical media consumers.

Third and Fourth graders in Kuwait are learning to address visual stereotypes surrounding the Middle East through media literacy education, in part to be better able to challenge representation.

=== Africa ===
The UNESCO Media and Information Literacy Alliance, formerly known as Global Alliance for Partnerships on Media and Information Literacy (GAPMIL), is an effort to promote international cooperation to promote media and information literacy. The organization held the Global Forum for Partnerships on Media and Information Literacy which took place from 26 to 28 June 2013, in Abuja, Nigeria to promote these goals.

<doc id="240073" wikidata="Q1752065" url="?curid=240073" title="Master Roshi">
<text>Master Roshi, known in Japan as as well as , is a fictional character in the Japanese manga series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and its anime adaptations created by Akira Toriyama.

Within the series, he is an elderly martial arts master, born on March 20, who is the creator of the technique. His students include Grandpa Son Gohan, The Ox-King, Son Goku, Krillin and Yamcha. He is bald, sports a thick van dyke beard, and wears sunglasses, beach clothes, or martial arts suits. He usually wields a walking stick and, in early appearances, wears a turtle&#x27;s shell on his back. In spite of his lechery, cantankerousness and occasional whimsy or foolishness, he is often depicted as wise and perceptive. While a popular character with &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; fans, the depiction of some of his antics has been met with criticism or deemed highly controversial.

==Voice actors==
Master Roshi&#x27;s design was inspired by the character of Kami-sama from Toriyama&#x27;s previous manga &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; and accordingly was originally voiced by Kōhei Miyauchi, who also voiced Kami-sama in the original &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; anime. For unknown reasons Miyauchi was unavailable for the recording of Dragon Ball Episode #137; the role was played by series narrator Jōji Yanami. Miyauchi&#x27;s final acting session before he died was for episode 260 of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, which he recorded only 3 months before his death. Kame-Sennin is voiced by Hiroshi Masuoka from episode 288 of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; onward, in &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; and the &quot;2008 Jump Super Anime Tour film&quot;. He is voiced by Kinya Aikawa in the 10th anniversary movie, by Takko Ishimori in gameplay of &quot;Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure&quot;, by Masaharu Satō in the thirteenth &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; movie and all media following &quot;Dragon Ball Kai&quot;., and by Nobuaki Kanemitsu in &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot;.

In the Ocean dub, he is voiced by Michael Donovan, Ian James Corlett, Peter Kelamis, Don Brown, and Terry Klassen at various points. Dean Galloway voices him in the Blue Water dub, while Mike McFarland voices him in the Funimation dub. Other English dub voice actors include Ed Marcus, Nesty Ramirez, Dave Bridges, and Kirk Thornton.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Dragon Ball&quot;===

Master Roshi&#x27;s first appearance is in chapter #3 of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga. Roshi lives with his longtime companion, an anthropomorphic turtle referred to as Umigame (ウミガメ, &quot;Sea Turtle&quot;), on an island with a house built on it known as &quot;Kame House&quot;. Kame House eventually serves as a gathering place for Goku and his associates throughout the series, as well as a home for certain recurring characters like Oolong or Krillin and his young family. Graduates of Roshi&#x27;s training (i.e. Goku, Krillin, Yamcha) often wear the kanji for &quot;Turtle&quot; (&quot;Kame&quot;) on their &quot;dogi&quot;. When wishing to fight anonymously at the World Martial Arts Tournament, Roshi assumes a disguise and calls himself &quot;Jackie Chun&quot;.

Master Roshi is consistently depicted as a pervert who frequently flirts with or harasses physically attractive female characters. In Chapter 5 of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series, published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on January 15, 1985, Roshi makes sexual advances on &quot;Bulma&quot; who is wearing a suggestive bunny costume; it is in fact an impersonation by a shapeshifting Oolong, who seduces Roshi by inviting him to place his face between his &quot;breasts&quot; and calls the act &quot;Puff Puff&quot;. The term is derived from the Japanese onomatopoeia for a woman rubbing her breasts in another person&#x27;s face, though it can also be used to refer to a woman juggling her own breasts.

When tasked with putting out a fire on Mount Frypan, Master Roshi demonstrated an ability to greatly increase his energy. In this state, his appearance changes dramatically, with an enormous increase in muscle mass and likewise height which was nearly equal to Piccolo. Due to his natural precision in battle, this bulky state does not appear to affect his speed and agility. In this state, he can perform many ki attacks at their maximum potential, most noticeably an enhanced version of his &quot;Kamehameha&quot; attack, which was so powerful that it was able to destroy the moon.

At the beginning of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series, he is considered to be the strongest mortal fighter in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; universe, however his power level began to pale in comparison to Goku and his allies later in the series. While his legacy is demonstrated in the prolific use of the &quot;Kamehameha&quot; technique by numerous characters in the series, his prominence has diminished greatly by the time Goku reaches adulthood. He would only make occasional appearances as a supporting character and no longer operate as an active fighter.

===&quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;===
Master Roshi would return to prominence as a major character with the revival of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series in the 2010s. In the film Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27; and its counterpart story arc in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, Master Roshi would join Goku and his friends in their fight against a resurrected Frieza leading his army to Earth and exact vengeance against Goku. It is also implied on one episode that the Paradise Herb is the source of Master Roshi&#x27;s long lifespan, as he claims that eating some of it would allow him to live on for another millennia.

In the Universe Survival arc of the &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; manga, Roshi is revealed to have been secretly training and holding back his true strength, and he is later recruited as one of the representatives of the Seventh Universe by Goku, not for his strength, but for his knowledge in fighting in tournaments. But as his perverted behavior got him caught in a mind control spell by a Crane School student named Yurin, Roshi enlists Puar to build up a resistance to beautiful women. Master Roshi manages to eliminate competitors from other universes during the tournament and is one of the last 6 remaining members of universe 7 in the tournament. Roshi later instructs Goku as he struggles fighting against Jiren, telling him that plain old fighting strength is not a way to measure things, that they master the martial arts not to win fights but to conquer their own selves. Jiren begins to attack Roshi, but the old master is able to avoid all attacks as he focuses on controlling his body. Ultimately, Jiren is able to eliminate Roshi after chopping at his neck, but his sacrifice is not in vain as Goku uses Roshi&#x27;s teaching to unlock the new form, &quot;Ultra Instinct&quot;, as Roshi watches from the sidelines.

In the anime he is forced to eliminate himself when an altercation with the Sixth Universe warrior Frost nearly kills him from excessive use of the &quot;Mafuba&quot; technique.

===In other media===
In June 1988, Master Roshi along with other &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters were featured in two public safety announcement shorts. The first was entitled , and the second called where he along with Krillin, Yamcha, and later Goku become volunteer fire fighters.

Master Roshi is portrayed by Chow Yun-fat in the American live-action film &quot;Dragonball Evolution&quot;; his voice was dubbed over by Tsutomu Isobe in the Japanese version.

Roshi was included as one of eight character pairings in &quot;Dragon Ball x One Piece: Cross Epoch&quot;, a crossover manga between their respective &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;One Piece&quot; series. In the 2013 crossover TV special , Roshi is one of the participants in the Food Tournament (Tenkaichi Kuōkai), consisting of a race to the center of the hosting island and the championship prize of luxuriously rare Carat Sizzled Cattle, hosted by the International Gourmet Organization (IGO).

Roshi is a playable character in the following video games:
*&quot;Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Battle 22&quot;
*&quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi&quot;
*&quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2&quot; (Playable w/Jackie Chun as an alternate outfit, has MAX Power Mode as transformation)
*&quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3&quot; (same as above.)
*&quot;Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure&quot; (Playable as Jackie Chun)
*&quot;Dragon Ball FighterZ&quot; (DLC)

==Reception and controversy==

Master Roshi is a popular and widely recognized character, who has appeared in several &quot;top&quot; character lists by fans and critics. Japanese fans voted Master Roshi the thirteenth most popular character of the series in a 2004 poll. Master Roshi was ranked second place in a Japanese fan poll conducted by Charapedia for their favorite lecherous male anime and manga characters. Master Roshi was ranked among IGN&#x27;s Top 13 &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; Characters List published in 2015, which acknowledged Roshi&#x27;s primary role within the series as a comic relief character but also emphasized the importance of the character&#x27;s in-universe legacy for being the inventor of the Kamehameha, &quot;the franchise&#x27;s most recognizable move and Goku’s signature technique&quot;, and that he can still hold his own in battle when necessary. Roshi came in 12th place on &quot;Complex&quot;″s list &quot;A Ranking of All the Characters on &#x27;Dragon Ball Z&quot;: Pearce observed that while Master Roshi&#x27;s role in the series deteriorated with the arrival of the Saiyan characters, he still pops up to offer advice, support, and comic relief.

Master Roshi has received particular attention for his lewd sensibilities as well as his constant attempts to catch the series&#x27; female characters in revealing positions. Tim Jones from Them Anime Reviews believed that while fan service is prevalent in the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series, he opined that it is not very extremely offensive as characters like Roshi quite often gets beaten up or punished in retaliation for comedic effect. Master Roshi&#x27;s scene with Oolong who is disguised as Bulma originated the slang term &quot;puff puff&quot;, which is later referenced in other works which has Toriyama&#x27;s involvement, such as the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; franchise. References to the act were removed from the American television broadcast of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime adaptation. The character&#x27;s lecherous behaviour towards a female character named Yurin in a &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; episode provoked a major complaint by Japan&#x27;s Broadcasting Ethics and Program Improvement Organization due to the underlying theme of sexual harassment. Another &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; scene, where Roshi persuades Pu&#x27;ar to shapeshift into a scantily clad young woman in order to motivate him to train better, provoked controversy in Argentina. This led to the series being banned in the country as of September 2021.

Reviewing the live-action &quot;Dragonball Evolution&quot; for &quot;IGN&quot;, Christopher Monfette said that Chow Yun-Fat&#x27;s performance successfully captured Master Roshi&#x27;s &quot;whimsical, half-drunken essence&quot;.

<text>The Tongmenghui of China was a secret society and underground resistance movement founded by Sun Yat-sen, Song Jiaoren, and others in Tokyo, Empire of Japan, on 20 August 1905, with the goal of overthrowing China&#x27;s Qing dynasty. It was formed from the merger of multiple late-Qing dynasty Chinese revolutionary groups.

==History==
===Revolutionary era===
The Tongmenghui was created through the unification of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Xingzhonghui (Revive China Society), the Guangfuhui (Restoration Society) and many other Chinese revolutionary groups. Among the Tongmenghui&#x27;s members were Huang Xing, Li Zongren, Zhang Binglin, Chen Tianhua, Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, Tao Chengzhang, Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Zhang Renjie, and Qiu Jin.

In 1906, a branch of the Tongmenghui was formed in Singapore, following Sun&#x27;s visit there; this was called the Nanyang branch and served as headquarters of the organization for Southeast Asia. The members of the branch included Wong Hong-kui (), Tan Chor Lam (; 1884–1971) and Teo Eng Hock (; originally a rubber shoe manufacturer). Tan Chor Lam, Teo Eng Hock, and Chan Po-yin (; 1883–1965) started the revolution-related &quot;Chong Shing Chinese Daily Newspaper&quot; (), with the inaugural issue on 20 August 1907 and a daily distribution of 1,000 copies. The newspaper ended in 1910, presumably due to the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Working with other Cantonese people, Tan, Teo, and Chan opened the revolution-related Kai Ming Bookstore () in Singapore. For the revolution, Chan Po-yin raised over 30,000 yuan for the purchase and shipment (from Singapore to China) of military equipment and for the support of the expenses of people travelling from Singapore to China for revolutionary work.

From December 1906 to April 1908, seven Tongmenghui-led uprisings were defeated by the Qing government. Numerous Tongmenghui members fled to southeast Asia. There was an increase in discontent by the membership against Tongmenghui leadership.

In 1909, the headquarters of the Nanyang Tongmenghui was transferred to Penang. Sun Yat-Sen himself was based in Penang from July to December 1910. During this time, the 1910 Penang Conference was held to plan the Second Guangzhou Uprising. The high-powered Preparatory Meeting of Dr. Sun Yat Sen&#x27;s supporters was subsequently held in Ipoh - at the villa of Teh Lay Seng, chairman of Tungmenghui Ipoh at Jalan Sungai Pari - to raise funds. The Ipoh leaders were Teh Lay Seng, Wong I Ek, Lee Guan Swee and Lee Hau Cheong. The leaders launched a major drive for donations across the Malay Peninsula. An amount of $47,683 Straits Settlement dollars was raised. The Tongmenghui also started a newspaper, the &quot;Kwong Wah Jit Poh&quot;, with the first issue published in December 1910 from 120 Armenian Street, Penang.

In Henan, some Chinese Muslims were members of the Tongmenghui.

===Republican era===
After Shanghai was occupied by the revolutionaries in November 1911, the Tongmenghui moved its headquarters to Shanghai. After the Nanjing Provisional Government was established, the headquarters was moved to Nanjing. A general meeting was held in Nanjing on 20 January 1912, with thousands of members attending. Hu Hanmin, who represented the Provisional President Sun Yat-sen, moved that the Tongmenghui oath be changed to &quot;overthrow the Manchu government, consolidate the Republic of China, and implement the &quot;Min Sheng Chu I&quot;. Wang Jingwei was elected as Chairman, succeeding Sun. Wang resigned the following month, and Sun resumed the chairmanship.

After the establishment of the Republic of China, the Tongmenghui transformed itself into a political party on 3 March 1912, in preparation for participation in constitutional and parliamentary activities. It issued a Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, which consisted of 34 articles, meaning it had 10 more than the constitutional proposal made when the Tongmenghui was a secret society. The leadership election was held on the same day, with Sun Yat-sen elected as Chairman, Huang Xing and Li Yuanhung as Vice-Chairmen. In May 1912, the Tongmenghui moved its headquarters to Beijing. At that time, the Tongmenghui was the largest party in China, with branches in Guangdong, Sichuan, Wuhan, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Anqing, Fuzhou and Tianjin. It had a membership of about 550,000. In August 1912, the Tongmenghui formed the nucleus of the Kuomintang, the governing political party of the republic.

==Slogan and motto==
In 1904, by combining republican, nationalist, and socialist objectives, the Tongmenghui came up with their political goal: to expel the Manchu rulers, to revive &quot;Zhonghua&quot;, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people. (). The Three Principles of the People were created around the time of the merging of Revive China Society and the Tongmenghui.

<doc id="240075" wikidata="Q466009" url="?curid=240075" title="Charles Carroll of Carrollton">
<text>Charles Carroll (September 19, 1737 – November 14, 1832), known as Charles Carroll of Carrollton or Charles Carroll III, was an American politician, planter, and signatory of the Declaration of Independence. He was the only Catholic signatory of the Declaration and the longest surviving, dying 56 years after its signing.

Considered one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Carroll was known contemporaneously as the &quot;First Citizen&quot; of the American colonies, a consequence of signing articles in the &quot;Maryland Gazette&quot; with that pen name. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress and Confederation Congress. Carroll later served as the first United States Senator for Maryland. Of all of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Carroll was one of the wealthiest and most formally educated. A product of his 17-year Jesuit education in France, Carroll spoke five languages fluently.

Born in Annapolis, Maryland, Carroll inherited vast agricultural estates and was regarded as the wealthiest man in the American colonies when the American Revolution commenced in 1775. His personal fortune at this time was reputed to be 2,100,000 pounds sterling, the (US$375 million). In addition, Carroll presided over his manor in Maryland, a 10,000-acre estate, and claimed as his property approximately 300 slaves. Though barred from holding office in Maryland because of his religion, Carroll emerged as a leader of the state&#x27;s movement for independence. He was a delegate to the Annapolis Convention and was selected as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1776. He was part of an unsuccessful diplomatic mission, which also included Benjamin Franklin and Samuel Chase, that Congress sent to Quebec in hopes of winning the support of French Canadians.

Carroll served in the Maryland Senate from 1781 to 1800. He was elected as one of Maryland&#x27;s inaugural representatives in the United States Senate but resigned his seat in 1792 after Maryland passed a law barring individuals from simultaneously serving in both state and federal office. After retiring from public service, he helped establish the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad by purchasing $40,000 of state-backed securities and serving on its first board of directors.

==Ancestry==
The Carroll family were descendants of the Ó Cearbhaill&#x27;s, who were the rulers of the Irish petty kingdom of Éile in King&#x27;s County, Ireland. Carroll&#x27;s grandfather was Charles Carroll the Settler, an Irishman from Aghagurty who moved to London in 1685 and worked as a clerk for English nobleman Lord Powis before emigrating to Maryland in October 1688. After arriving in Maryland, he settled in the colonial capital of St. Mary&#x27;s City with a commission as an attorney general from the colony&#x27;s proprietor, Lord Baltimore.

Carroll&#x27;s maternal ancestry was English, as his mother hailed from the Brooke family.

Carroll&#x27;s father was Charles Carroll of Annapolis, who was born in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1702. Though he inherited the plantation of Doughoregan Manor from his father, as a Roman Catholic he was forbidden from participating in the political affairs of the colony.

==Early life==

Carroll was born on September 19, 1737, in Annapolis, Maryland, the only child of Charles Carroll of Annapolis and his wife Elizabeth Brooke. He was born an illegitimate child, as his parents were not married at the time of his birth, for technical reasons to do with the inheritance of the Carroll family estates. They eventually married in 1757. The young Carroll was educated at a Jesuit preparatory school known as Bohemia Manor in Cecil County on Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore. At age 11, he was sent to France, where he continued in Jesuit schools, first at the College of St. Omer in Northern France and later the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, graduating in 1755. He continued his studies in Europe and read law in London before returning to Annapolis in 1765.

Charles Carroll of Annapolis granted Carrollton Manor to his son, Charles Carroll of Carrollton. It is from this tract of land that he took his title &quot;Charles Carroll of Carrollton.&quot; Like his father, Carroll was a Catholic and as a consequence was barred by Maryland statute from entering politics, practicing law and voting. This did not prevent him from becoming one of the wealthiest men in Maryland (or indeed anywhere in the Colonies), owning extensive agricultural estates, most notably the large manor at Doughoregan, Hockley Forge and Mill, and providing capital to finance new enterprises on the Western Shore.

==American Revolution==

===Voice for independence===
Carroll was not initially interested in politics, and in any event Catholics had been barred from holding office in Maryland since the 1704 act seeking &quot;to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province&quot;. But as the dispute between Great Britain and her American colonies intensified in the early 1770s, Carroll became a powerful voice for independence. In 1772, he engaged in a debate, conducted through anonymous newspaper letters, maintaining the right of the colonies to control their own taxation. Writing in the &quot;Maryland Gazette&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;First Citizen,&quot; he also criticized the royal governor&#x27;s proclamation that increased special fees paid by colonists to state officials and Protestant clergy. Opposing Carroll in these written debates, using the name &quot;Antillon&quot;, was Daniel Dulany the Younger, a noted lawyer and Loyalist politician. In these debates, Carroll argued that the government of Maryland had long been the monopoly of four families, the Ogles, the Taskers, the Bladens and the Dulanys, with Dulany taking the contrary view. Eventually word spread of the true identity of the two combatants, and Carroll&#x27;s fame and notoriety began to grow. Dulany soon resorted to highly personal ad hominem attacks on &quot;First Citizen&quot;, and Carroll responded, in statesmanlike fashion, with considerable restraint, arguing that when &quot;Antillon&quot; engaged in &quot;virulent invective and illiberal abuse, we may fairly presume, that arguments are either wanting, or that ignorance or incapacity know not how to apply them&quot;. Following these written debates, Carroll became a leading opponent of British rule and served on various committees of correspondence.

In the early 1770s, Carroll appears to have embraced the idea that only war could break the impasse with Great Britain. According to legend, Carroll and Samuel Chase (who would also later sign the Declaration of Independence on Maryland&#x27;s behalf) had the following exchange:
:Chase: &quot;We have the better of our opponents; we have completely written them down.&quot;
:Carroll: &quot;And do you think that writing will settle the question between us?&quot;
:Chase: &quot;To be sure, what else can we resort to?&quot;
:Carroll: &quot;The bayonet. Our arguments will only raise the feelings of the people to that pitch when open war will be looked to as the arbiter of the dispute.&quot;

===Continental Congress===
Beginning with his election to Maryland&#x27;s committee of correspondence in 1774, Carroll represented the colony in most of the pre-revolutionary groups. He became a member of Annapolis&#x27; first committee of safety, known as the &quot;Annapolis Committee of Correspondence and Council Safety&quot; in 1775. Carroll was a delegate to the Annapolis Convention, which functioned as Maryland&#x27;s revolutionary government before the Declaration of Independence. In early 1776, the Congress sent him on a four-man diplomatic mission to the Province of Quebec, in order to seek assistance from French Canadians in the coming confrontation with Great Britain. Carroll was an excellent choice for such a mission, being fluent in French and a Catholic and therefore well suited to negotiations with the French-speaking Catholics of Quebec. He was joined in the commission by Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase, and his cousin John Carroll. The commission did not accomplish its mission.
Carroll was elected as a Maryland representative the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and remained a delegate until 1778. He arrived at the 2nd Continental Congress too late to vote in favor of the Declaration of Independence but was present to sign the official document that survives today. He signed the document in Philadelphia on August 2, 1776. After both Thomas Jefferson and John Adams died on July 4, 1826, Carroll became the last living signatory of the Declaration of Independence. His signature reads &quot;Charles Carroll of Carrollton&quot; to distinguish him from his father, &quot;Charles Carroll of Annapolis,&quot; who was still living at that time, and several other Charles Carrolls in Maryland, such as Charles Carroll, Barrister, and his son Charles Carroll Jr., also known as &quot;Charles Carroll of Homewood.&quot; He is usually referred to this way by historians. At the time, he was the richest man in America and had much to lose by identifying himself on the document. Throughout his term in the Second Continental Congress, he served on the board of war. Carroll also gave considerable financial support to the American Revolutionary War.

==Post-revolution political career==
Carroll returned to Maryland in 1778 to assist in the formation of a state government. Carroll was re-elected to the Continental Congress in 1780, but he declined to take his seat. Instead, he accepted election to the Maryland Senate in 1781 and served there until 1800. In November 1779, the Maryland House of Delegates moved to pass a bill authorizing the confiscation of property from those who would not renounce their allegiance to England, without any right to a legal hearing or remedy. Carroll opposed this measure, questioning the motives of those who pressed for confiscation and arguing that the measure was unjust. However, such moves to confiscate Tory property had much popular support and eventually, in 1780, the measure passed.

When the United States government was created, the Maryland legislature elected him to the first session of the United States Senate. In 1792, Maryland passed a law that prohibited any man from serving in the state and national legislatures at the same time. Since Carroll was more interested in matters concerning his home state, he resigned from the U.S. Senate on November 30, 1792.

==Attitude toward slavery==
The Carroll family were slaveholders and Carroll was reputedly the largest single slave owner at the time of the American Revolution. Carroll was opposed in principle to slavery, asking rhetorically: &quot;Why keep alive the question of slavery? It is admitted by all to be a great evil.; let an effectual mode of getting rid of it be pointed out, or let the question sleep forever;&quot; However, although he supported its gradual abolition, he did not free his own slaves. Carroll introduced a bill for the gradual abolition of slavery in the Maryland Senate, but it did not pass. In 1828, aged 91, he served as president of the Auxiliary State Colonization Society of Maryland, the Maryland branch of the American Colonization Society, an organization dedicated to returning Black Americans to lead free lives in African states such as Liberia.

==Later life==
Carroll retired from public life in 1801. After Thomas Jefferson became president, he had great anxiety about political activity and was not sympathetic to the War of 1812. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815. Carroll came out of retirement to help create the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1827.

In 1828, he commissioned the Phoenix Shot Tower in Baltimore and laid its cornerstone. The 234-foot tower, which is still standing, was the tallest structure in the United States until the Washington Monument was built. Carroll&#x27;s last public act, on July 4, 1828, was the laying of the &quot;first stone&quot; (cornerstone) of the railroad at almost 91 years of age. &quot;The Carrollton March&quot;, written in his honor to celebrate the occasion, is recognized as the first train song.

Carroll was admitted as an honorary member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Maryland in 1828. Unlike hereditary members, honorary members are not eligible to be represented by a living descendant. In May 1832, he was asked to appear at the first Democratic Party Convention but did not attend on account of poor health. Carroll died on November 14, 1832, at age 95, in Baltimore, at the Caton home.

He holds the distinction of being the oldest-lived Founding Father. He had outlived four of the first five U.S. presidents. His funeral took place at the Baltimore Cathedral (now known as the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary). Carrol was buried in his Doughoregan Manor Chapel at Ellicott City, Maryland after a national day of mourning.

==Legacy==

Carroll is remembered in the third stanza of the former state song &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot;.

:Thou wilt not cower in the dust,
:Maryland! My Maryland!
:Thy beaming sword shall never rust,
:Maryland! My Maryland!
:Remember Carroll&#x27;s sacred trust,
:Remember Howard&#x27;s warlike thrust –
:And all thy slumberers with the just,
:Maryland! My Maryland!

Named in his honor are counties in Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Virginia as well as two Louisiana parishes, East and West Carroll. Cities and towns named for him are in Georgia, Kentucky, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, and New York, as well as neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Tampa. Charles Carroll Middle School in New Carrollton, Maryland; Charles Carroll High School in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Philadelphia; and Carroll University in Waukesha, Wisconsin, are named in his honor.

In 1876, the Centennial Exhibition held to commemorate the birth of the United States was held in Philadelphia. The Catholic Abstinence Union of America commissioned the Catholic Total Abstinence Union Fountain for the Centennial Exhibition. The fountain was commissioned and created by sculptor Herman Kim to promote American morality, and the centerpiece of the fountain is a statue of Moses. There are four other statues that surround it, making up the points of the Maltese cross: Carroll, Father Mathew, Commodore John Barry, and Archbishop John Carroll. The fountain is located in West Fairmount Park.

In 1903, the state of Maryland added a bronze statue of Carroll to the United States Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. Sculpted by Richard E. Brooks, it is located in the Crypt. In 1906, the University of Notre Dame constructed a residence hall known as Carroll Hall. Paca-Carroll House at St. John&#x27;s College is named for Carroll and his fellow signer of the Declaration of Independence, William Paca. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

Carroll is depicted in the 2004 film &quot;National Treasure.&quot;

==Family==
Carroll married Mary Darnall (1749–1782), known as Molly, on June 5, 1768. She was a granddaughter of Henry Darnall (Carroll was a great-grandson of Darnall). They had seven children before Molly died in 1782, but only three survived infancy:
* Mary Carroll (1770–1846), who married Richard Caton (1763–1845), an English immigrant who became a Baltimore merchant. From 1820 to 1832, Carroll would winter with the Catons in Baltimore. Their daughters were:
** Marianne Caton (1788–1853), who married Robert Patterson (brother of Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte). After his death, she married Anglo-Irish statesman Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley (1760–1842), then the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who was the brother of the legendary military commander Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who was believed to have been previously Marianne&#x27;s paramour.
** Elizabeth Caton (1790–1862), who married George Stafford-Jerningham, 8th Baron Stafford.
** Louisa Caton (1793–1874), who married Col. Sir Felton Bathurst-Hervey, 1st Baronet. After his death, she married Francis D&#x27;Arcy-Osborne, Marquess of Carmarthen (later the 7th Duke of Leeds).
** Emily Caton (1794/5-1867), who married John McTavish (1788–1852), who served as British Consul to Baltimore. They were parents of four children including Mary Wellesley McTavish (1826–1915), The Hon. Mrs Henry George Howard (of the Earls of Carlisle).
* Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825) (sometimes known as Charles Carroll of Homewood because he oversaw its design and construction), married Harriet Chew (1775–1861) from Philadelphia. Harriet was the daughter of Benjamin Chew, the chief justice of Pennsylvania, and her sister married John Eager Howard, who had served in the Senate with Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Charles Jr. reportedly consumed up to two quarts of brandy a day. This led to erratic behavior that resulted in his separation from Harriet.
* Catherine (&quot;Kitty&quot;) Carroll (1778–1861), who married Robert Goodloe Harper (1765–1826), a lawyer and U.S. senator.

Today, Carroll&#x27;s descendants continue to own Doughoregan Manor, the largest parcel of land in Howard County, Maryland, with over 1,000 acres (4 km2) of valuable but historically preserved land in Ellicott City, Maryland.

Anne Marie Becraft&#x27;s grandmother, a free Black woman, worked as a housekeeper for Carroll. Carroll presented Anne Marie&#x27;s father with several of the Carroll family&#x27;s prized relics, paintings, and other keepsakes just before Carroll&#x27;s death in 1832.

==Carroll&#x27;s signature==

In the 1940s, newspaper journalist John Hix&#x27;s syndicated comic &quot;Strange as It Seems&quot; published an apocryphal explanation for Charles Carroll&#x27;s distinctive signature on the Declaration of Independence. Every member of the Continental Congress who signed this document automatically became a criminal, guilty of sedition against King George III. Carroll, because of his wealth, had more to lose than most of his companions. Some of the signators, such as Caesar Rodney and Button Gwinnett, had unusual and distinctive names which would clearly identify them to the King; other signators, with more commonplace names, might hope to sign the Declaration without incriminating themselves.

According to Hix, when it was Carroll&#x27;s turn to sign the Declaration of Independence, he rose, went to John Hancock&#x27;s desk where the document rested, signed his name &quot;Charles Carroll&quot; and returned to his seat. At this point another member of the Continental Congress, who was prejudiced against Carroll because of his Catholicism, commented that Carroll risked nothing in signing the document, as there must be many men named Charles Carroll in the colonies, and so the King would be unlikely to order Carroll&#x27;s arrest without clear proof that he was the same Charles Carroll who had signed the Declaration. Carroll immediately returned to Hancock&#x27;s desk, seized the pen again, and added &quot;of Carrollton&quot; to his name.

In fact, Carroll had been appending &quot;of Carrollton&quot; to his signature for over a decade, the earliest surviving example appearing at the end of a September 15, 1765, letter to his English friend William Gibson. Carrollton Manor was the name of a tract of more than twelve thousand acres in Frederick County, Maryland, which the Carroll family leased to tenant farmers.

<doc id="240079" wikidata="Q14544" url="?curid=240079" title="Weekend Update">
<text>Weekend Update is a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch and satirical news program that comments on and parodies current events. It is the show&#x27;s longest-running recurring sketch, having been on since the show&#x27;s first broadcast and been featured in the vast majority of episodes since. It is typically presented in the middle of the show immediately after the first musical performance, and with some exceptions is the only sketch not to feature the episode&#x27;s host.

The format of the sketch involves one or two of the players cast in the role of news anchor, presenting news headlines based on current events that are immediately followed by a gag commentary that twists the context into something humorous. The anchors also act as hosts for occasional editorials, commentaries, or other performances by other cast members or guests, either playing fictionalized versions of themselves, impressions of real-life figures, or invented characters; these guests often display eccentric behavior and baffling commentaries, with the anchors acting as straight people reacting accordingly. 

In modern times, dedicated anchors are chosen among writing staff, often lead writers, in lieu of cast or featured players.
Chevy Chase, the original cast member filling the role of the anchor, has said that &quot;Weekend Update&quot; paved the way for comedic news shows like &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, and several &quot;Weekend Update&quot; hosts have gone on to host their own late-night talk shows, most notably fellow NBC properties &quot;Late Night&quot; (Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers) and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (Fallon). The current hosts of the segment are writing staff members and former lead writers Colin Jost and Michael Che; Jost also holds the longest tenure of any &quot;Weekend Update&quot; host.

==History==
===&quot;Weekend Update&quot; (1975–1981)===

====Chevy Chase (1975–1976)====
&quot;Weekend Update&quot; was created by original anchor Chevy Chase and &quot;SNL&quot; writers Herb Sargent and Al Franken. The sketch appeared on the first &quot;SNL&quot; broadcast on October 11, 1975 as the weekly &quot;Update&quot; to NBC News&#x27; monthly news magazine &quot;&quot;Weekend&quot;&quot;, hence &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. Chase popularized several catchphrases during the segment, such as his &quot;I&#x27;m Chevy Chase... and you&#x27;re not&quot; greeting; and his repeated announcement that &quot;Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead&quot;. &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segments frequently opened with Chase having an intimate conversation with someone on the phone, unaware he was &quot;on the air.&quot; Chase ended &quot;Weekend Update&quot; with what became its signature catchphrase: &quot;That&#x27;s the news...good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow.&quot;

In addition, Garrett Morris parodied the practice of a picture insert of a person delivering the news in sign language for the hearing impaired. Chase would announce, &quot;...and now, I shall repeat the top news story, assisted by the President of the Society for The Hard of Hearing.&quot; Chase would then repeat the story while Morris simply cupped his mouth and yelled the headline.

====Jane Curtin (1976–1980)====
Jane Curtin substituted for Chase during for a few shows due to Chase&#x27;s injury. Subsequently, she replaced him when he left in the fall of 1976. Curtin stayed as anchor until the end of Season 5 in 1980. She finished Season 2 solo but was then paired with co-anchors Dan Aykroyd (1977–1978) and Bill Murray (1978–1980), with Aykroyd being &quot;promoted&quot; to &quot;Station Manager&quot; in September 1978.

A frequent feature of &quot;Weekend Update&quot; during this time was &quot;Point/Counterpoint&quot;, a send-up of the then-current &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment of the same name with James J. Kilpatrick and Shana Alexander. &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s version featured Curtin and Aykroyd as debaters, with each making personal attacks on the other and their positions; a common pattern had Aykroyd announcing the topic, followed by Curtin making an opening statement, with Aykroyd retorting &quot;Jane, you ignorant slut&quot; and Curtin replying &quot;Dan, you pompous ass&quot;.

Other popular guests during Curtin&#x27;s tenure as anchor included John Belushi and Gilda Radner&#x27;s characters Emily Litella and Roseanne Roseannadanna. During Curtin&#x27;s tenure as host, she opened each &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment with Roger Grimsby&#x27;s &quot;Here now, the news&quot; sign-on, and closed with Chase&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s the news. Goodnight and have a pleasant tomorrow&quot;.

====Charles Rocket (1980–1981)====
Charles Rocket (later teamed with Gail Matthius) anchored during the one-season (1980–1981) tenure of new executive producer Jean Doumanian. Rocket is notable as being the only &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor to have experience as a real news anchor, having served as anchorman at KOAA-TV in Pueblo, Colorado, under his birth name Charles Claverie and WTVF Nashville under the name Charles Kennedy.

Rocket&#x27;s final appearance was on the penultimate episode of the season, airing on March 7, 1981, and hosted by Bill Murray. For that episode, &quot;Weekend Update&quot; received a one-time name and set change to &quot;Saturday Night NewsLine&quot; and featured three segments: science edition, hosted by Dr. Jonathan Lear (Mark King), arts and leisure correspondent Bill Murray, and news by Rocket. Rocket signed off each week by saying &quot;Good night and watch out.&quot;

Prior to the final episode of the season, Jean Doumanian and most of the cast, including Rocket, were fired. Chase hosted the last episode and anchored &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, as he had on his previous appearances as host.

===&quot;SNL NewsBreak&quot; (1981–1982)===
The anchor position changed hands frequently under Dick Ebersol, executive producer of &quot;SNL&quot; from 1981 to 1985. Brian Doyle-Murray was teamed first with Mary Gross, then going solo for three months, then back with Gross for one more month before finally being teamed with Christine Ebersole for the remainder of the season. Doyle-Murray signed off each week with &quot;Good night, and good news.&quot;

===&quot;Saturday Night News&quot; (1982–1985)===
Brad Hall took over the desk of the retitled &quot;Saturday Night News&quot; in 1982 through most of the 1983 season. By the 1983 season, he began signing out with phrase &quot;Thanks for coming out in the rain!&quot; Hall was removed from the anchor position halfway through the 1983–84 season. For the rest of the season, and into the next, there were no regular anchors—both cast members and &quot;SNL&quot; guest-hosts took turns at the chair (Hall himself left the show at the end of the 1983–1984 season). In December 1984, Christopher Guest became the new anchor. However, within this period, the &quot;SNL&quot; broadcast of December 8, 1984 is the only episode to not feature the satirical news segment on the show, at all.

===&quot;Weekend Update&quot; (1985–present)===

==== Dennis Miller (1985–1991) ====
In 1985, Lorne Michaels returned to produce the show, bringing the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; name back with him. The new anchor was Dennis Miller, who remained in the chair for six years, the longest run for a solo &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor. Miller opened the segments by saying &quot;Good evening, and what can I tell ya?&quot; and signed off by saying &quot;Guess what, folks? That&#x27;s the news, and I am outta here!&quot; He would then scribble nonsense on his script, sometimes throwing it into the air. Miller left &quot;SNL&quot; in 1991. Dana Carvey did a memorable mockery of Miller anchoring during this period, to the point Carvey&#x27;s impersonation would &quot;itself&quot; become another character, being further impersonated by Tom Hanks simply dressing as Miller and clucking like a chicken.

During many of his Weekend Update segments, Miller was joined by The Weekend Update Dancers.

====Kevin Nealon (1991–1994)====
Kevin Nealon took over with his &quot;Mr. Subliminal&quot; character and as the straight man in many highlights such as &quot;Operaman&quot; and &quot;Cajun Man&quot; (with both characters being played by Adam Sandler) and also for Chris Farley&#x27;s &quot;Bennett Brauer&quot; character. Nealon had a three-year stint at the &quot;Update&quot; desk before requesting his departure, as he felt his time behind the desk was drawing away from other acting opportunities on the show. Nealon signed off with the tagline &quot;I&#x27;m Kevin Nealon, and that&#x27;s news to me&quot;.

====Norm Macdonald (1994–1997)====
Norm Macdonald, whom Chase called &quot;the only other guy who did [the segment] funny,&quot; took over the role for Season 20. Al Franken, whose history with &quot;SNL&quot; dated back to 1975, had been lobbying to replace Nealon as &quot;Weekend Update&quot; host. Accordingly, Franken left the show after losing the anchor spot. Although Nealon no longer anchored &quot;Weekend Update,&quot; he still remained on the show until the end of Season 20. Macdonald would open each segment with &quot;I&#x27;m Norm Macdonald, and now the fake news.&quot;

Running gags by Macdonald included punchlines involving Frank Stallone and Germans loving David Hasselhoff. In his last two seasons, he introduced another recurring gag where he would read a news story and then record a &quot;note to self&quot; on a tape recorder regarding the story he had just read. One of the most frequent guest correspondents during Macdonald&#x27;s run was Joe Blow (played by Colin Quinn), a blue-collar guy who would rant about things that bother him. He would often make Macdonald uncomfortable and always ask when they were &quot;gonna go for a beer together,&quot; to which Macdonald would always end up turning him down. His sign off was frequently &quot;And that&#x27;s the way it is&quot;, emulating Walter Cronkite&#x27;s famous sign-off phrase.

Another common topic of Macdonald&#x27;s jokes was O. J. Simpson after his arrest and trial for murder. For example, he joked that &quot;A down-and-out O. J. Simpson... has decided to go back to doing what he does best: killing people,&quot; and upon Simpson&#x27;s acquittal he declared &quot;well, it is finally official: murder is legal in the state of California.&quot; &quot;SNL&quot; writer Jim Downey recalled that &quot;we did, like three solid years of, like, 60 shows of O.J. jokes in a row.&quot; Macdonald made his final appearance as &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor in December 1997, after NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer—a longtime friend of Simpson, who had previously told Michaels to not let his friendship affect the show—demanded Macdonald&#x27;s dismissal from the segment, despite Michaels&#x27;s protest that making the change in the middle of the season would be difficult for the show. Ohlmeyer told Macdonald that he was fired because he was not funny.

====Colin Quinn (1998–2000)====
Macdonald was replaced by Colin Quinn, who started on the first episode after Macdonald had been removed and served through the 1999–2000 season. His first edition of &quot;Weekend Update&quot; began with &quot;Have you ever gone to a bar and found that your favorite bartender was replaced with a guy named Steve?&quot; He would pause for a beat before continuing, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m Steve; what can I get you?&quot; His sign-off, borrowing from a Collin Raye song, was &quot;I&#x27;m Colin Quinn, that&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m sticking to it!&quot;

For the first half of the 1998–1999 season, Quinn would do a pre-desk monologue, where he would provide commentary and rant about the week&#x27;s biggest news stories. This feature was discontinued after the January 16, 1999, episode.

Quinn stepped down from &quot;Weekend Update&quot; after 1999–2000, when he left &quot;SNL&quot; at the end of the season. He anchored the segment for two-and-a-half seasons.

====Jimmy Fallon and Tina Fey (2000–2004)====
Over the summer of 2000, cast members auditioned to be replacements. Among the candidates were stand-up comics Kevin Brennan and Jeffrey Ross plus two duos:Ana Gasteyer with Chris Parnell, and Jimmy Fallon with writer Tina Fey. The latter duo was chosen, and they made their first on-air appearance that October. Fallon ended each &quot;Weekend Update&quot; sketch by throwing his pencil at the camera and cheering if he managed to hit it. Fey often signed off with Chase and Curtin&#x27;s &quot;Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow&quot;.

Recurring features of the Fallon/Fey era included the &quot;&quot;Update&quot; Door,&quot; a door on the left of the set where celebrities, as impersonated by &quot;SNL&quot; cast members (and at one time the Land Shark) would walk through to do a commentary—a segment called &quot;Terrible ReEnactments&quot;, in which Chris Kattan would do an intentionally bad re-enactment of a news story that had occurred during the week (usually the story involved a celebrity being injured); and regular appearances from Jeff Richards&#x27;s Drunk Girl character.

Chris Parnell announced the intro for the first season. He was then followed by future &quot;Update&quot; co-anchor Amy Poehler.

====Tina Fey and Amy Poehler (2004–2006)====
Fallon left to pursue a film career in 2004, and was replaced by fellow cast member Amy Poehler as co-anchor, giving the sketch its first two-woman anchor team. Fallon became the announcer for the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; intro for the next few seasons.

The 2005–2006 season began with Poehler returning to her seat behind the desk.

The segment is featured in the 2006 film &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in which Robin Williams appears on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; alongside Poehler and Fey.

====Amy Poehler and Horatio Sanz (2005)====
Fey temporarily left the show after giving birth to her first child and was replaced briefly by Horatio Sanz as co-anchor (Sanz wore horn-rimmed glasses during Fey&#x27;s absence). Fey returned to the show in October for the season&#x27;s third live episode.

====Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers (2006–2008)====
After the departure of Fey, Poehler continued as co-anchor along with new co-anchor Seth Meyers for the 2006–2007 season. The duo began a string of running gags, including &quot;Really!?! with Seth and Amy&quot;, in which the pair lambast celebrities for lack of common sense. Poehler left &quot;SNL&quot; in fall 2008 to give birth to her first child.

During the 2007–2008 season, two previous hosts returned to the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; desk for one-off appearances–Chevy Chase, as &quot;Senior Political Correspondent&quot; and Tina Fey, as &quot;Special Women&#x27;s News Correspondent&quot;. Women&#x27;s News was a running segment during the Fey/Poehler era. Alaska Governor Sarah Palin also appeared on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; once during the 2008–09 season and ended the segment with the traditional &quot;Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow&quot;, as Poehler had left her seat to perform a &quot;Sarah Palin rap&quot;.

====Seth Meyers (2008–2013)====
Beginning October 25, 2008, Meyers anchored the segment alone with Poehler still being credited, but not appearing. On December 6, 2008, Poehler returned, four weeks after the birth of her child, to do &quot;Weekend Update&quot; with Meyers, but on the December 13, 2008, &quot;Weekend Update&quot; she announced to the audience that the show was her last one.

After that, Meyers continued anchoring &quot;Weekend Update&quot; solo. The &quot;Really!?!&quot; celebrity-mocking gag (retitled &quot;Really!?! with Seth&quot;) remained, featuring various hosts and guests including Tracy Morgan and Jerry Seinfeld in March 2009 and Kermit the Frog in November 2011. In May 2010, Poehler returned to do it once more, alongside Tina Fey as well.

A running gag of this era was Bobby Moynihan&#x27;s portrayal of Snooki from &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;. Moynihan displays a certain attraction to Meyers, who makes fun of the general attitude of the cast members of &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; as well as Snooki&#x27;s own personal attributes. Another popular segment was city correspondent Stefon, played by Bill Hader.

During his time in office, New York Governor David Paterson (played by Fred Armisen) often appeared as a guest on the segment, and which often featured jokes about Paterson&#x27;s blindness and his apparent hatred for the state of New Jersey. In the premiere episode of &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s 36th season, Paterson himself made a guest appearance on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; next to Armisen. Amy Poehler, who had returned to host the episode, co-anchored &quot;Weekend Update&quot; as she traditionally did before her departure.

On the December 17, 2011, episode, which was hosted by Jimmy Fallon, multiple former anchors returned for a &quot;&quot;Weekend Update&quot; Joke-Off&quot;. Along with Meyers, the anchors included Fallon, Poehler, and Fey.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; confirmed that Amy Poehler would appear on &quot;Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday&quot; for at least two broadcasts as co-anchor in fall 2009. For the third episode of &quot;Weekend Update Thursday&quot;, Seth Meyers anchored solo. After each episode, the anchor(s) would throw to &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. Lorne Michaels had stated that there would be six more episodes of &quot;Weekend Update Thursday&quot;; however, the spring 2010 episodes were scrapped.

Poehler returned on both the February 18, 2012, and May 18, 2013, episodes to perform &quot;Really!?! with Seth and Amy&quot; twice more. In both instances, Meyers asked her if she would like to co-anchor with him again for the rest of that segment; he was barely able to finish asking before she accepted.

====Seth Meyers and Cecily Strong (2013–2014)====
On May 12, 2013, NBC announced that Seth Meyers would become the new host of &quot;Late Night&quot; in 2014, succeeding Jimmy Fallon, who would take over as the new host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. In September 2013, Lorne Michaels confirmed that Meyers, who would stay on at &quot;SNL&quot; for at least the first half of the show&#x27;s 39th season, would be joined at the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor desk by a new co-anchor, Cecily Strong, beginning with the show&#x27;s season premiere on September 28, 2013. Strong, who joined &quot;SNL&quot; the previous season and had been upgraded to repertory status in the cast for her sophomore season, was no stranger to the segment, making visits to the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; desk as her recurring character &quot;The Girl You Wish You Hadn&#x27;t Started a Conversation with at a Party&quot;. Michaels, who also produces &quot;Late Night&quot;, hinted at Meyers potentially dropping in as &quot;Weekend Update&quot; co-anchor, noting that Meyers&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; will not tape on Friday nights. Meyers and Strong sign off with &quot;For &#x27;Weekend Update&#x27;, I&#x27;m Seth Meyers!&quot; &quot;And I&#x27;m Cecily Strong, good night!&quot; before performing a fist bump or blowing kisses to the audience.

On February 1, 2014, Meyers performed his final episode of &quot;SNL&quot; and was joined at the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; desk by Strong, Poehler, Hader in character as Stefon, Andy Samberg, and Armisen as Governor Paterson.

====Cecily Strong and Colin Jost (2014)====
&quot;SNL&quot; writer Colin Jost replaced Meyers as co-anchor of &quot;Weekend Update&quot; beginning with the March 1 episode, which was hosted by Jim Parsons. For the duration of this tenure, Strong stayed to the right side while Jost went to the left. Strong led off each broadcast except for the May 3, 2014 episode hosted by Andrew Garfield, when Jost led off.

====Colin Jost and Michael Che (2014–present)====
Comedian and &quot;SNL&quot; writer Michael Che replaced Cecily Strong beginning with the season 40 premiere, hosted by Chris Pratt. Che&#x27;s pairing with Colin Jost is the first in which both anchors are male. Che is also the first African-American &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor. As of the 2021–22 season, Jost and Che are the longest tenured &quot;Update&quot; anchors in the show&#x27;s history, with Jost becoming the longest running &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor on October 23, 2021, and Che rising to second place on January 29, 2022.

Che led off the broadcast on his premiere episode. Starting with the October 4, 2014, episode hosted by Sarah Silverman, each anchor tells at least one extended joke per segment.

So far, this era features many appearances from cast members playing some version of themselves, most notably Pete Davidson and Leslie Jones. Longtime cast member Kenan Thompson has also developed several new characters and impressions, including Willie, Michael Che&#x27;s fictional neighbor. Thompson also has brought on impressions of former MLB star David Ortiz and LaVar Ball. With Cecily Strong no longer anchoring &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, she reprised characters like The Girl You Wish You Hadn&#x27;t Started a Conversation with at a Party and Cathy Anne, a woman with a southern accent who hits on Michael Che.

On October 13, 2018, former cast member/&quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor Seth Meyers hosted the show for the first time since taking over hosting &quot;Late Night&quot;, and he returned to &quot;Weekend Update&quot; for the first time since he left the show, in a segment called &quot;Really?!? With Seth, Colin, and Michael&quot;, a callback to the &quot;Really?!? With Seth and Amy&quot; segments. This time, Meyers, Jost, and Che talk and joke about rapper Kanye West (a Trump supporter) visiting the White House.

For the Thanksgiving episode in 2015, Jost and Che did a joke swap, where they each read a joke written for them by the other. Since season 44 in 2018, at the end of each Christmas show and season finale (except for season 47 and 48) Jost and Che have continued this segment, with both of them reading multiple jokes written by the other (except for the season 45 finale, where only Jost read a joke written by Che). During the segment, Jost&#x27;s jokes for Che regularly consist of Che acting sleazy, often including bestiality and child sexual abuse, while Che forces Jost to say highly racist and sexist jokes, sometimes at the expense of his wife Scarlett Johansson, and to make him defend controversial figures such as Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein. In 2024, Johansson was present in Studio 8H during the segment and reacted to Jost deliver jokes centered around the recent birth of their child.

Due to COVID-19 issues, the December 18, 2021 episode was filmed with no audience and a limited cast and crew. &quot;Weekend Update&quot; was still performed, but Jost was not part of the episode&#x27;s cast, as he had tested positive for COVID. Tina Fey made a surprise guest appearance to fill in for Jost; due to the reduced staff, the segment was performed on chairs placed on the main stage rather than its usual newsroom set.

As well, actor Mark King (as &quot;Dr. Jonathan Lear&quot;) made a lone co-anchor appearance during season 6, in 1981.

== Controversies ==

=== Norm Macdonald ===
In the mid-1990s, former Weekend Update host Norm Macdonald was fired from SNL for tackling taboo topics including the highly controversial 1994 murder trial of O.J. Simpson. Macdonald&#x27;s comedic approach to the sensitive subject matter often crossed lines for some viewers and network executives. Don Ohlmeyer, former president of NBC&#x27;s West Coast division, was a close friend of Simpson, and took great offense to Macdonald&#x27;s jokes, ultimately firing Macdonald for his poor taste in comedy during the 23rd season.

Macdonald was immensely popular with audiences, leading to questions about his abrupt removal. Controversy broke out about the comedic freedom regarding sensitive topics highlighting the complex dynamic between the network and talent.

=== Leslie Jones ===
In May 2014, Leslie Jones was criticized for a string of slave jokes. She made a joke about Lupita Nyong’o, most well-known for her role as Nakia in &quot;Black Panther&quot;, being named People magazine’s most beautiful person, saying that during the slave days she herself would’ve been the most sought after, making comments about how she would have been paired with the best guy on that plantation and would have been the number one pick in the “slave draft.” On Twitter she responded in defending her joke and how she was sad she has to defend herself to the black community.

=== Michael Che and Colin Jost ===

During a joke swap segment, Che was criticized for making jokes about Beyoncé&#x27;s lighter complexion and blonde hair, about Scarlett Johansson being a better &quot;Black Widow&quot; than Coretta Scott King, and facetiously comparing Barack Obama to an African dodo.

In the season 40 finale of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in May 2015, during the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment, Colin Jost delivered a joke with the punchline &quot;jalapeño business,&quot; a pun sounding like &quot;all up in your business.&quot; In a recent interview on the &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; podcast with Dana Carvey and David Spade, Michael Che recalled his strong disapproval of the joke, even threatening to quit if it aired. Despite his objections, Jost performed the joke, which received substantial audience laughter, intensifying Che&#x27;s frustration. Jost admitted he wasn&#x27;t initially keen on the joke but felt compelled to perform it after seeing Che&#x27;s upset reaction. Despite the incident, Che remained on the show.

On October 21, 2020, Michael Che discussed the reversal of &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; and made a joke calling it &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tuck&quot;. The joke was criticized as transphobic. &quot;Weekend Update&quot; had previously come under fire for a 2016 joke about the dating app Tinder adding 37 gender identity options, a feature which Colin Jost jokingly called, &quot;Why Democrats lost the election&quot;.

In an interview for CBS News on May 15, 2022, Che said, &quot;I do think that controversy brings people to talking. And I think as long as people are talking, it&#x27;s not all that bad.&quot;

Scarlett Johansson recently shared her shock over a &quot;vulgar&quot; joke swap between her husband, Colin Jost, and Michael Che during the December 21, 2024 &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. The segment, where they read each other’s unreviewed jokes, left Johansson stunned as she watched live. She joked that Che might have a vendetta against them, adding, “I honestly feel he’s trying to get us permanently removed.” Despite the explicit humor, she took it in stride and even suggested getting back at Che with a teleprompter swap on &quot;Today With Jenna &amp; Friends&quot;.

<doc id="240082" wikidata="Q1285613" url="?curid=240082" title="Spencer Abraham">
<text>Edward Spencer Abraham (born June 12, 1952) is an American attorney, author, and politician who served as the 10th United States Secretary of Energy from 2001 to 2005, under President George W. Bush. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a United States Senator from Michigan from 1995 to 2001. Abraham is one of the founders of the Federalist Society, and a co-founder of the &quot;Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy&quot;. As of 2025, he is the last Republican to have served as a U.S. senator from Michigan.

==Education and family==
Abraham was born in East Lansing, Michigan, the son of Juliette Elizabeth (Sear), a member of the Michigan Republican State Central Committee, and Eddie Joseph Abraham. He is a graduate of East Lansing High School. Of Lebanese descent, Abraham is married to Jane Abraham, chair of the Susan B. Anthony List. They have three children. He holds a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard University, and is a 1974 Honors College graduate of Michigan State University. In 1978, while at Harvard Law School, Abraham helped found the &quot;Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy&quot;, which became one of the official journals of the Federalist Society, which was founded in 1982.

== Political career ==
Before his election to the Senate, Abraham was a law professor at Thomas M. Cooley Law School.

=== Republican Party service ===
He was elected chairman of the Michigan Republican Party from 1983 to 1990. He was deputy chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle from 1990 to 1991. He later served as co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) from 1991 to 1993 and ran for chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1993, coming second to Haley Barbour.

=== United States Senate ===
Abraham was elected to represent Michigan in the United States Senate in 1994, and he served until 2001 after being defeated for reelection in 2000 by Debbie Stabenow. He was the only Lebanese American in the chamber. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, state Republicans attributed his loss to &quot;scathing advertisements by a wide range of special interest groups, including advertisements that criticized Mr. Abraham&#x27;s support for a relaxation of some immigration restrictions&quot;. During the campaign, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an anti-immigration advocacy group with ties to white nationalism, ran ads asking: &quot;Why is Senator Spencer Abraham trying to make it easier for terrorists like Osama bin Laden to export their war of terror to any city street in America?&quot; The media denounced these commercials as &quot;vengeful&quot;. In 1996, when President Bill Clinton endorsed Representative Barbara Jordan&#x27;s proposed cuts to legal immigration, Abraham played a leading role in blocking the cuts. Another factor in his defeat was his vote to convict Clinton in his 1999 impeachment trial. The next year he received the &quot;Defender of the Melting Pot&quot; award from the National Council of La Raza for his efforts on immigration.
===Committee service and legislation===
Abraham served on the Budget, Commerce, Science and Transportation, Judiciary, and Small Business Committees. He also chaired two subcommittees: Manufacturing and Competitiveness, and Immigration. Abraham authored the H1B Visa in Global and National Commerce Act, establishing a federal framework for online contracts and signatures; the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, and the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, which protects Internet domain names for businesses and persons against copyright and trademark infringements. In 1999, Abraham co-sponsored S.896, a bill to abolish the U.S. Department of Energy, which would have transferred control of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in large part to the Defense Department.

===U.S. Energy Secretary===

In 2001, George W. Bush appointed Abraham Secretary of Energy. On November 15, 2004, Abraham announced that he would resign from this position, effective with the swearing-in of his successor, Samuel W. Bodman, on February 1, 2005.

In 2004, Lebanese Ambassador Farid Abboud awarded Abraham the National Order of the Cedar.

=== Hoover Institution ===
From 2005 to 2007, Abraham was a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a think tank based at Stanford University. After leaving office, he opened The Abraham Group, a Washington DC–based international strategic consulting firm, of which he is chairman and CEO.

===Fred Thompson presidential campaign===
On July 24, 2007, Abraham was announced as an &quot;ambassador to official Washington&quot; for Fred Thompson&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.

==Later career==
In 2006, Abraham was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of AREVA Inc., the American arm of the French nuclear company Areva, which is planning to build EPR nuclear power plants in the United States and is building the mixed oxide fuel (MOX) manufacturing plant at the Savannah River Site to convert legacy weapons-grade plutonium into power station fuel.

With William Tucker, Abraham wrote &quot;Lights Out!: Ten Myths About (and Real Solutions to) America&#x27;s Energy Crisis&quot; (2010).

In 2016, Abraham was elected to the board of trustees of the California Institute of Technology.

<doc id="240088" wikidata="Q2438494" url="?curid=240088" title="In Living Color">
<text>In Living Color is an American sketch comedy television series that originally ran on Fox from April 15, 1990, to May 19, 1994. Keenen Ivory Wayans created, wrote and starred in the program. The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with 20th Television and was taped at stage 7 at the Metromedia Square on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.

The title of the series was inspired by the NBC announcement of broadcasts being presented &quot;in living color&quot; during the 1960s, prior to mainstream color television. It also refers, in the sense of the term &quot;person of color&quot;, to the fact that most of the show&#x27;s cast was African Americans, unlike other popular sketch comedy shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, whose casts were mostly White at the time. &quot;In Living Color&quot; portrayed a form of irreverent Black humor in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding Black comedy on television had been set by inoffensive family-friendly shows such as &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayanses.

Other members of the Wayans family—Damon, Kim, Shawn, and Marlon—had regular roles, while brother Dwayne frequently appeared as an extra. The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors, including Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey, Tommy Davidson, David Alan Grier, Kelly Coffield Park, and T&#x27;Keyah Crystal Keymáh. The show introduced Jennifer Lopez and Carrie Ann Inaba as members of &quot;In Living Color&quot;&#x27;s dance troupe The Fly Girls, with actress Rosie Perez serving as choreographer. The show was immensely popular in its first two seasons, capturing more than a 10-point Nielsen rating; in the third and fourth seasons, ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with the Fox network&#x27;s leadership over creative control and rights.

The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series in 1990. The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live, special episode as a counterprogram for the halftime show of U.S. leader CBS&#x27;s live telecast of Super Bowl XXVI, prompting the National Football League to book A-list acts for future game entertainment, starting with Michael Jackson the following year. In 2018, a history of the show, &quot;Homey Don&#x27;t Play That!&quot; by David Peisner, was released by 37 INK, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster.

=== Early history ===
Following Keenen Ivory Wayans&#x27; success with &quot;Hollywood Shuffle&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot;, Fox approached Wayans to offer him his own show. Wayans wanted to produce a variety show similar to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but with a cast of people of color that took chances with its content. Fox gave Wayans a lot of freedom with the show, although Fox executives were a bit concerned about the show&#x27;s content prior to its television debut.

In announcing its debut, Fox described &quot;In Living Color&quot; as a &quot;contemporary comedy variety show&quot;. In its preview, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; warned that its, &quot;raw tone may offend some, but it does allow a talented troupe to experiment with black themes in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;-ish format.&quot; Keenen Ivory Wayans said, &quot;I wanted to do a show that reflects different points of view. We&#x27;ve added an Asian and a Hispanic minority to the show. We&#x27;re trying in some way to represent all the voices. ... Minority talent is not in the system and you have to go outside. We found Crystal doing her act in the lobby of a theater in Chicago. We went beyond the Comedy Stores and Improvs, which are not showcase places for minorities.&quot;

The first episode aired on Sunday, April 15, 1990, following an episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. The first episode was watched by 22.7 million people, making it the 29th-most-viewed show for the week.

&quot;The Miami Herald&quot; said the show was as &quot;smart and saucy as it is self-aware&quot; and &quot;audacious and frequently tasteless, but terrific fun&quot;. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called it &quot;the fastest, funniest half-hour in a long time&quot;. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; said it had &quot;the free-wheeling, pointed sense of humor that connects with a large slice of today&#x27;s audience&quot;. &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; described it as a &quot;marvelously inventive&quot; show that has &quot;catapulted television back to the cutting edge&quot;.

When asked about the show&#x27;s use of stereotypes of Black culture for comedy, Wayans said, &quot;Half of comedy is making fun of stereotypes. They only get critical when I do it. Woody Allen has been having fun with his culture for years, and no one says anything about it. Martin Scorsese, his films basically deal with the Italian community, and no one ever says anything to him. John Hughes, all of his films parody upscale White suburban life. Nobody says anything to him. When I do it, then all of a sudden it becomes a racial issue. You know what I mean? It&#x27;s my culture, and I&#x27;m entitled to poke fun at the stereotypes that I didn&#x27;t create in the first place. I don&#x27;t even concern myself with that type of criticism, because it&#x27;s racist in itself.&quot;

=== Opening credits ===
For the first episode, an exotic-looking logo was used for the opening credits. However, after the band Living Colour claimed in a lawsuit that the show stole the band&#x27;s logo and name, the logo was changed to one with rather plain-type letters of three colors. The show title itself is a homage to the NBC Peacock tag line, &quot;The following program is brought to you in living color&quot; from the 1960s when television was transitioning from black &amp; white to color TV.

In the first two seasons, the opening sequence was set in a room covered with painters&#x27; tarps. Each cast member, wearing black-and-white, played with brightly colored paint in a different way (throwing paintballs at the camera by hand, spray painting the lens, using a roller to cover the camera lens, etc.). The sequence ended with a segue to a set built to resemble the rooftop of an apartment building, where the show&#x27;s dancers performed a routine and opened a door to let Keenen Ivory Wayans greet a live audience.

For the third and fourth seasons, an animated sequence and different logo were used. Cast members were superimposed over pictures hanging in an art gallery and interacted with them in different ways (spinning the canvas to put it right-side up, swinging the frame out as if it were a door, etc.). The final image was of the logo on a black canvas, which shattered to begin the show. The fifth season retained the logo, but depicted the cast members on various signs and billboards around a city (either New York or Chicago), ending with the logo displayed on a theater marquee. The main title sequences were created by Klasky-Csupo, best known for &quot;Rugrats&quot; and produced by Robert Jason with some graphics by Beau Tardy.

The hip-hop group Heavy D &amp; the Boyz performed two different versions of the opening theme. One version was used for the first two seasons and remixed for the fifth, while the other was featured in the third and fourth seasons.

=== The Fly Girls ===
The show employed an in-house dance troupe known as the &quot;Fly Girls&quot;. The original lineup consisted of Carrie Ann Inaba (who became a choreographer and judge on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;), Cari French, Deidre Lang, Lisa Marie Todd, Barbara Lumpkin and Michelle Whitney-Morrison. Rosie Perez was the choreographer for the first four seasons. The most notable former Fly Girl was future actress/singer Jennifer Lopez, who joined the show in its third season.

Throughout the show&#x27;s run, the Fly Girls frequently performed a dance routine to lead into commercial breaks and/or during the closing credits. In the first two seasons, they also performed a routine that immediately followed the opening sequence. Music was provided by an in-house DJ – Shawn Wayans (credited as SW-1) in the first two seasons, then DJ Twist from season 3 onward.

The Fly Girls would sometimes be used as extras in sketches, or as part of an opening gag. In one sketch, they were shown performing open-heart surgery (in the sketch, the girls are dancing in order to pay their way through medical school). Another routine featured the three original female cast members dancing off-beat during the introduction of the show, when it was revealed that the regular Fly Girls were all bound and gagged and breaking through the door where Keenan Ivory Wayans enters.

Three of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;&#x27;s second season in 1997.

=== Wayans family departures ===
Keenen Ivory Wayans stopped appearing in sketches in 1992 after the end of the third season, over disputes with Fox about the network censoring the show&#x27;s content and rerunning early episodes without his consultation. Wayans feared that Fox would ultimately decrease the syndication value of &quot;In Living Color&quot;. Kim Wayans, who appeared in the first four seasons, left the series before season 5.

== Broadcast and syndication ==
Originally produced by 20th Television on Fox, the series was in reruns on local affiliates for a few years, but has since become a longstanding mainstay on FX and FXX, which had been sister channels to Fox prior to being acquired by The Walt Disney Company. In syndication, the series is distributed by Disney-ABC Domestic Television.

Reruns have also aired on MTV2, VH1, NuvoTV, Fusion TV, BET, and Centric, while the series previously aired on Aspire and TV One as of September 2020.

Unlike past runs on FX and the Viacom Media Networks, the FXX cut of episodes are mostly uncut and censored. The music video parodies and spoken references to licensed songs have been reinstated, but the &quot;Bolt 45&quot; sketch, the &quot;drop the soap&quot; line, and the &quot;Men on Football&quot; sketch with the adlibbed lines about Richard Gere&#x27;s and Carl Lewis&#x27;s alleged homosexuality are still edited (though the facial ejaculation shot on &quot;Men on Fitness&quot; was reinstated), along with a line from the season five sketch &quot;Fire Marshall Bill at the Magic Show&quot; that makes reference to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing (the missing line is, &quot;That&#x27;s what they said about the World Trade Center, son. But me and my friend Abdul and a couple of pounds of plastique explosives showed them different.&quot; Bill&#x27;s laugh and his catchphrase &quot;Lemme show ya somethin&#x27;&quot; was also cut abruptly), due to the September 11, 2001 attacks.

&quot;The Best of In Living Color&quot; aired on MyNetworkTV from April 16 to June 18, 2008. Hosted by David Alan Grier, it was a retrospective featuring classic sketches, along with cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. The show aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central, after MyNetworkTV&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Under One Roof&quot;.

== Home media ==
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has released all five seasons of &quot;In Living Color&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Due to music licensing issues, some sketches have been edited to remove any and all mention of licensed songs, from characters waxing lyrical to entire performances (including the music video parodies and some of the Fly Girl dancing interstitials). Additionally, the &quot;Bolt 45&quot; sketch (which aired once on May 5, 1990) was omitted, and the &quot;soap&quot; portion of the &quot;drop the soap&quot; line in the second &quot;Men on Film&quot; sketch has been muted.

== Crossovers ==
*At the 2006 BET Awards when the show returned from one of its commercial breaks, the show&#x27;s host Damon Wayans played a character very reminiscent to &quot;Men on ...&quot; critic Blaine Edwards
*&quot;In Living Color&quot; alums Damon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and David Alan Grier reprised some of their &quot;In Living Color&quot; characters on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;:
**Damon Wayans, a featured player during that show&#x27;s eleventh season, hosted an episode from &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s 20th season in 1995, where he brought on two of his famous &quot;In Living Color&quot; characters: homeless wino Anton Jackson and gay film critic Blaine Edwards. In the latter sketch, David Alan Grier made a surprise on-set appearance as Antoine Merriweather; Grier himself would also host SNL on December 9, 1995 (season 21) and January 18, 1997 (season 22), but did not reprise any of his In Living Color characters during those respective episodes.
**Jim Carrey auditioned to be one of the repertory members on &quot;SNL&quot;″s ill-fated 1980–1981 season, but was dropped in favor of Charles Rocket (who later appeared in the 1988 film &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot; and the 1994 film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; with Carrey). Carrey also auditioned for the 1985–1986 season (season 11), but backed out after seeing a man threatening to jump from 30 Rockefeller Center, believing that the stress of working on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; would drive Carrey to suicide. Carrey hosted the season finale of &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s 21st season in 1996, where he impersonated Fire Marshal Bill during the monologue. Carrey&#x27;s most recent hosting stint, in October 2014, involved a Carrey family reunion sketch in which Cecily Strong plays Carrey&#x27;s aunt, who is modeled after Fire Marshal Bill.
*Jamie Foxx reprised his role as Wanda in a short segment at the 2009 BET Awards.
* In 1997, three of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;&#x27;s second season.
*In the 1997 film &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, Jim Carrey reprised his &quot;Fire Marshal Bill&quot; character (albeit with no lines) in the background of one of the closing scenes.
*The February 10, 2001 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosted by Jennifer Lopez included a sketch where Lopez &quot;reunited&quot; with the Fly Girls (played by Rachel Dratch, Jerry Minor and Tracy Morgan).

== Attempted revival ==

In 2011, there were plans to make a revival of the original series that featured a new cast, characters, and sketches. The pilot episodes were hosted and executive produced by original series creator and cast member Keenen Ivory Wayans. In early 2012, Tabitha and Napoleon D&#x27;umo were hired as the choreographers. They cast the new line-up of The Fly Girls and shot pilot episodes for the show which were set to air on Fox, like the original. However, on January 8, 2013, Keenen Ivory Wayans confirmed the reboot had been canceled because he and Fox did not feel that the show was sustainable after one season.
Reported cast members included Cooper Barnes, Jennifer Bartels, Sydney Castillo, Josh Duvendeck, Jermaine Fowler, Ayana Hampton, Kali Hawk, and Lil Rel Howery. In addition, featured cast members were Henry Cho, Melanie Minichino, and Chris Leidecker. Members of the new Fly Girls included Christina Chandler, Tera Perez, Lisa Rosenthal, Katee Shean, and Whitney Wiley.

Many of the cast members of the revival (Bartels, Fowler, and Howery) went on to create the TruTV sketch show &quot;Friends of the People&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Singer Bruno Mars paid tribute to the television program in the music video for his single &quot;Finesse&quot;.

<text>Gabriel Mary Byrne (5 August 1934 – 4 November 2019) was an Irish presenter and host of radio and television. His most notable role was as the first host of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; over a 37-year period spanning 1962 until 1999. &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; is the world&#x27;s longest-running live chat show. He was affectionately known as &quot;Uncle Gay&quot;, &quot;Gaybo&quot; or &quot;Uncle Gaybo&quot;. His time working in Britain with Granada Television saw him become the first person to introduce the Beatles on-screen, and Byrne was later the first to introduce Boyzone on-screen in 1993. According to Byrne, Paul McCartney asked him to be the Beatles&#x27; agent during a sound check for his show but he declined the offer.

From 1973 until 1998, Byrne presented &quot;The Gay Byrne Hour&quot; – later &quot;The Gay Byrne Show&quot; when it expanded to two hours – on RTÉ Radio 1 each weekday morning. After retiring from his long-running radio and television shows, Byrne presented several other programmes, including &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; and &quot;For One Night Only&quot; on RTÉ One and &quot;Sunday Serenade&quot;/&quot;Sunday with Gay Byrne&quot; on RTÉ lyric fm. In 2006, he was elected Chairman of Ireland&#x27;s Road Safety Authority. In his retirement he was described as the &quot;Elder Lemon of Irish broadcasting&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; said Byrne was &quot;unquestionably the most influential radio and television man in the history of the Irish State&quot;. He was approached to run in the 2011 Irish presidential election but declined to run, despite topping early opinion polls.

==Early life==
Byrne was the son of Edward Byrne, who joined the Irish Volunteers in 1912. In 1913, Edward Byrne enlisted as a professional trooper with the British Army&#x27;s 19th (Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Royal) Hussars cavalry regiment, given a background as a horseman from his father&#x27;s employment by the Earl of Meath as a coachman in County Wicklow. On the outbreak of World War I he was mobilised and went with his unit to the Western Front, where he took part in heavy fighting in the Ypres Salient and at the Battle of the Somme. He was discharged from the British Army at the war&#x27;s end in 1919. He later took part in the Irish War of Independence.

In the early 1920s, Edward Byrne was employed by Guinness&#x27; St. James&#x27;s Gate Brewery, where he worked for most of the rest of his life on the barges that operated on the River Liffey, transporting wooden casks from St. James&#x27;s Gate Brewery to sea ships at the North Wall in Dublin. Byrne&#x27;s father, Edward, married his mother, Annie, in 1917, when briefly home on leave from the war. The two had met near Bray just before the war began. Both of them were from County Wicklow. His siblings were Ray, Al, Ernest and Mary; all but Mary predeceased him.

Byrne was born on 5 August 1934 and grew up in The Liberties in Dublin. He first lived with his family at 17 Rialto Street, Rialto, Dublin, before his parents moved to 124 (later renumbered 512) South Circular Road, Dublin, in 1944. Byrne&#x27;s mother, Annie, died in late 1964.

Byrne attended Rialto National School (since closed) and several other schools for short periods. Subsequently, he was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers at Synge Street CBS. He and two classmates bought a jazz record when Byrne was fourteen years old in January 1948, at a time when Radio Éireann refused to play it because of its &quot;licentious&quot; content. In December 2009, Byrne returned to his old primary school on Synge Street to launch an online children&#x27;s book club, and read an extract from Marita Conlon-McKenna&#x27;s storybook &quot;In Deep Dark Wood&quot;. In 2009, whilst celebrating the 250th anniversary of Guinness, he revealed that he had once tried unsuccessfully to earn a job in the brewery near his childhood home.

When he was young, Byrne was inspired by the broadcaster Eamonn Andrews, who had a successful career on British television, and &quot;wanted to be what he was&quot;. Andrews was friendly with Byrne&#x27;s eldest brother. In 1958, he moved over to broadcasting when he became a presenter on Radio Éireann. He also worked with Granada Television and the BBC in England. At Granada, Byrne became the first person to introduce the Beatles on television when they made their small-screen debut on a local news programme &quot;People and Places&quot;. In 1961, Telefís Éireann (later Radio Telefís Éireann and now Raidió Teilifís Éireann) was set up. Byrne finally worked exclusively for the new Irish service after 1969. He introduced many popular programmes, with his most popular and successful programme being &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.

==Radio career==

Byrne began his broadcasting career on radio. Radio Éireann gave him a 15-minute slot on Monday nights which he used to play Jazz recordings, his first broadcast for the station being in 1958.

He is now best remembered for his two-hour morning show, &quot;The Gay Byrne Hour&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;The Gay Byrne Show&quot; (1972–1999). For many years the show was produced by John Caden. Joe Duffy was a reporter and occasional co-presenter on &quot;The Gay Byrne Show&quot;.

Byrne featured on radio occasionally after retiring from &quot;The Gay Byrne Show&quot; – in 2006, he began presenting a weekly Sunday afternoon show entitled &quot;Sunday Serenade&quot; on RTÉ lyric fm. After 2010, he could be heard playing jazz on Sunday afternoons on lyric fm. This two-hour show began after an encounter with Head of Lyric FM Aodán Ó Dubhghaill at the National Concert Hall. &quot;Sunday with Gay Byrne&quot; attracted 55,000 listeners through &quot;word of mouth&quot;: no advertising and no mention in the &quot;RTÉ Guide&quot;. The show was broadcast weekly approximately from September to March, with a break during the intervening six months. Byrne once commented on the emptiness of RTÉ at this time of the week: 

==Television==

===&quot;The Late Late Show&quot;===
On 5 July 1962, the first episode of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was aired on Irish television. Originally the show was scheduled as an eight-week summer filler. The programme, which is still broadcast, has become the world&#x27;s second longest-running chat show. The show became a forum where controversial topics such as the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, contraception, AIDS, unemployment, homosexuality, abortion, divorce and other hitherto taboo subjects were discussed openly in Ireland, alongside book reviews, celebrity visits, and music acts such as the Boomtown Rats, U2, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Elkie Brooks, Boyzone and Noel Gallagher. Other guests included Presidents of Ireland, successive Archbishops of Armagh, minor members of the British Royal Family, politicians, actors and authors.

The show had much to do in shaping the new Ireland that was emerging from the 1960s. Indeed, it was famously said by politician and Papal Knight, Oliver J. Flanagan that, &quot;there was no sex in Ireland until Teilifís Éireann went on the air&quot;. Bishop of Galway Michael Browne called him &quot;a purveyor of filth&quot; after he asked a woman what colour nightie she wore on her wedding night and she had replied that she believed she&#x27;d worn nothing.

More than a decade after departing his role as host of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; Byrne is remembered for conducting memorable interviews with former politician Pádraig Flynn and then Bishop of Galway Eamon Casey″s lover Annie Murphy, among others. Another memorable moment to occur on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was when he called the winner of a prize car live on air only to discover the woman&#x27;s daughter had died since she had entered.

During the early years of Byrne&#x27;s time hosting &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, prior to about 1978 when the second national Irish TV channel was launched, he was employed by RTÉ on a continuously renewing 3-month contract, lest his employer might want to fire him any time they choose.

Byrne and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; were central to the development of the careers of figures such as Mary Coughlan.

He was noted for wearing a &quot;Bing Crosby sweater&quot; when presenting &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot;.

On 21 May 1999, Byrne presented his last edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. He was presented with a Harley-Davidson motorcycle by Bono and Larry Mullen, Jr. Pat Kenny succeeded Byrne as presenter in September 1999, subsequently succeeded by Ryan Tubridy in September 2009. Byrne gave Tubridy his blessing upon taking over the role, saying: &quot;He has all the qualities required, the light deft touch together with a serious mind. I think it&#x27;s a great adventure that he&#x27;s setting off on&quot;. Byrne returned to &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; as a guest twice during Tubridy&#x27;s first season as the presenter, the latter appearance on the day of Gerry Ryan&#x27;s death.

===&quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;===

In April 2009, RTÉ One began broadcasting a series called &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, during which Gay Byrne interviewed public figures about issues of meaning and life. He preferred not to discuss his own faith: The programme has contained a number of significant moments, including actor Gabriel Byrne&#x27;s admission that he had been abused as a child at the start of the second series and Stephen Fry&#x27;s denunciation of God during the tenth series.

===Other television work===
In the 1960s, Byrne presented &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance for Granada Television&quot; with popular singing star Marion Ryan. The programme was filmed in the Ballroom at Belle Vue, Manchester and also featured original &quot;Come Dancing&quot; stars Syd Perkin and Edna Duffield.

Byrne compèred the finals of the Castlebar Song Contest in 1966 and 1967. He also presented the Rose of Tralee festival for 17 years until 1994. Between 1989 and 2001, Byrne hosted the RTÉ People in Need Telethon several times.

After &quot;retiring&quot;, Byrne hosted the Irish version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;. He also hosted &quot;The Gay Byrne Music Show&quot; and &quot;Make &#x27;Em Laugh&quot;, a series about comedy in Ireland, &quot;Gaybo&#x27;s Grumpy Men&quot; and &quot;Class Reunion&quot;.

In the summer season of 2000, Byrne hosted &quot;The Gay Byrne Music Show&quot;, which was a studio-based show aired on Saturday nights as a summer filler between 8 July and 19 August 2000 and showcased all genres of music in the company of the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. From 2011, he presented more summer filler light entertainment in the form of &quot;For One Night Only&quot;.

==Retirement==
Byrne did not completely retire and continued to feature occasionally on radio and television after leaving &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and &quot;The Gay Byrne Show&quot;. He launched Joe Duffy&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Just Joe&quot; in Harry&#x27;s Bar in October 2011.

In March 2006, Byrne was appointed as the chairman of the Irish Road Safety Authority, a public body given the task of improving road safety in the Republic of Ireland. The role saw him visit hospitalised survivors alongside President of Ireland Mary McAleese.

===Politics===

====Views====
In &quot;retirement&quot;, Byrne continued to make his political views known, including questioning then Taoiseach Brian Cowen and &quot;whether you can be Taoiseach and still sit up and have a pint in the local pub. You have to dignify the office&quot;. In later years he became known for his anti-EU stance. Bookmakers suggested Byrne might become Mayor of Dublin.

====Presidential prospects====

In August 2011, Byrne was approached by the once dominant political party Fianna Fáil as a possible independent nominee for that year&#x27;s presidential election. The media advised Byrne, who had enjoyed an avuncular relationship with the public as a performer over many decades, against such a move. An editorial in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; said: &quot;This isn&#x27;t some sort of a reality TV show but a contest for the highest office in the land.&quot; &quot;The Irish Times&quot; queried the distinction between Byrne as a performer versus Byrne as an individual. &quot;But who is it that the Irish people really love? Is it Gaybo or Gabriel Byrne? Given they don&#x27;t really know the man himself – a man who has retained his privacy throughout a lifetime of fame – the love is surely for the persona rather than the person.&quot; Byrne topped polls as the candidate people were most likely to vote for.

On 13 August 2011, Byrne announced that he would not be a candidate for the Presidency. Appearing later on TV3&#x27;s &quot;Midweek&quot; programme he called Martin McGuinness, who was contesting the election as a representative of Sinn Féin, a &quot;liar&quot;.

===One-man show===
Byrne performed a one-man show in front of a sold-out audience at the Gate Theatre on 18 September 2011. The performance was part of a benefit night to raise funds for the Irish Cancer Society. British Ambassador Julian King and Senator David Norris were among those in attendance.

==Personal life==
Byrne was married to Kathleen Watkins, formerly a well-known harpist. Watkins was also the first continuity announcer to appear on-screen on the opening night of Telefís Éireann on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1961. Byrne first met Watkins, a native of Saggart, County Dublin, in 1957. They married in Saggart Catholic church in 1964. The couple had two daughters, Suzy and Crona. The Byrne family lived on Howth Head in Dublin and in later years in Sandymount in Dublin. Byrne became a grandfather on 15 September 2004.

Byrne relied on an accountant friend, Russell Murphy, to manage his finances, and was personally distraught when upon Murphy&#x27;s death in 1986, it was found that most of his savings had been squandered, and this had been hidden from him.

His interests included jazz. He continued to play jazz recordings on the radio during his &quot;retirement&quot;.

He was a qualified private pilot.

===Health===
In later years, Byrne revealed he had hearing loss in one ear. He thought originally that it was due to working in the television and radio industry for over 50 years that caused his hearing loss, but later found out it was genetic as his mother, his sister and three brothers all had hearing problems.

In 2011, Byrne experienced a health scare at his home in Sandymount when he struggled to breathe. He was admitted to St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital complaining his lungs felt as if they were &quot;made of concrete&quot; and there was &quot;nothing going in&quot; and that he expected to die. In 2015, after spending Christmas at home with his family, he had a heart attack and was readmitted to hospital.

On 20 November 2016, he revealed live on his &quot;Time Warp&quot; radio broadcast on RTÉ Lyric FM that he was to begin treatment for prostate cancer, and that the cancer might have also spread to his lower back. He told listeners he would be taking a one-week break before returning to work. However, he did not return to the air. Byrne had been quoted by the &quot;Irish Mirror&quot; saying that &quot;Ideally, I would like to get back to doing my Sunday afternoon radio show on Lyric FM, but my wife and daughters tell me I&#x27;m not ready and won&#x27;t let me do it.&quot;

===Death===
Byrne died on 4 November 2019 at his home in Howth, aged 85, after a three-year battle with prostate cancer.
On 5 November 2019, a special live edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was broadcast on RTÉ One, with various tributes made to him.

His funeral took place on 8 November 2019 at St Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral in Dublin and was shown live on RTÉ. After the mass, the hearse carrying Byrne&#x27;s body made its way back to Howth and was greeted by fans along the route. He was laid to rest, privately at Saint Fintans Cemetery, Sutton.

==Honours and awards==
* In 1988, Byrne was awarded an honorary doctorate in letters from Trinity College Dublin.
* In 1999 he was granted the Freedom of the City of Dublin.
* He received a Lifetime Achievement Award in February 2007 from Irish Film and Television Network.
* He holds the record for the greatest number of Jacob&#x27;s Awards received, winning a total of six for his radio and television work.
* He was appointed chairman of the Road Safety Authority in Ireland in 2006.
* Outstanding Achievement PPI Radio Award (2009) &quot;The only surprise is that it has taken so long for Gaybo to get it&quot;.
* Marking RTÉ&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2011, Byrne appeared on a postage stamp, part of a set of three that also featured Anne Doyle and Emma O&#x27;Driscoll.
* A wax figure of Gay Byrne has been put on public display at Wax Museum Plus on Dublin&#x27;s College Green.

==Legacy==
Credited with being a catalyst in the transformation of Irish society since the 1960s, Byrne broke several societal taboos by engaging in discourse on subjects like contraception, homosexuality, and abortion. For example, when Barry Galvin—then Cork&#x27;s state solicitor—guested with Byrne on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in 1992 to discuss Ireland&#x27;s mounting problems with the illegal drug trade, he was subsequently given the post of first-ever head of the important Criminal Assets Bureau. Alongside Terry Wogan, Byrne was one of two Irish broadcast giants, but he was also described as solely &quot;the most famous Irish broadcaster in history&quot;, and he was lauded by the media as &quot;the man who changed Ireland&quot;.

According to Ryle Dwyer, writing in the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;, Byrne &quot;had more influence on changing life in this country than any of the political leaders&quot;. A 1998 poll found Byrne level with notorious former Taoiseach Charles Haughey as the most hated public figure in the country, but the same poll also found Byrne to be the most popular public figure.

<doc id="240090" wikidata="Q13329" url="?curid=240090" title="Piacenza">
<text>Piacenza (; ; ) is a city and (municipality) in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy, and the capital of the eponymous province. As of 2022, Piacenza is the ninth largest city in the region by population, with more than 102,000 inhabitants.

Westernmost major city of the region of Emilia-Romagna, it has strong relations with Lombardy, with which it borders, and in particular with Milan. It was defined by Leonardo da Vinci as a &quot;Land of passage&quot; in his Codex Atlanticus, by virtue of its crucial geographical location. This strategic location would influence the history of Piacenza significantly at several times.

Piacenza integrates characteristics of the nearby Ligurian and Piedmontese territories added to a prevalent Lombard influence, favored by communications with the nearby metropolis, which attenuate its Emilian footprint.

Piacenza is located at a major crossroads at the intersection of Route E35/A1 between Bologna and Milan, and Route E70/A21 between Brescia and Turin. Piacenza is also at the confluence of the Trebbia, draining the northern Apennine Mountains, and the River Po, draining to the east.

Piacenza hosts three universities, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Polytechnic University of Milan and University of Parma.

== Etymology ==
The etymology is long-standing, deriving from the Latin &quot;Placentia&quot; tracing an origin from the verb , &quot;to please&quot;. The name means &quot;pleasant&quot; or (as James Boswell reported some of the etymologists of his time to have translated it) &quot;comely abode&quot;, and it was given as a good omen.

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===

==== Pre-Roman era ====
Before its settlement by the Romans, the area was populated by other peoples; specifically, just prior to the Roman settlement, the region on the right bank of the Po River between the Trebbia River and the Taro River had been occupied by the Ananes or Anamari, a tribe of Cisalpine Gauls. Before then, according to Polybius, &quot;These plains were anciently inhabited by Etruscans&quot; before the Gauls took the entire Po Valley from them.

==== Roman age ====
in May 218 BC, Piacenza and Cremona were founded as Roman military colonies. The Romans had planned to construct them after the successful conclusion of the latest war with the Gauls ending in 219 BC. In the spring of 218 BC, after declaring war on Carthage, the Senate decided to accelerate the foundation and gave the colonists 30 days to appear on the sites to receive their lands. Each colony was to be settled by 6,000 Roman citizens, but the cities were to receive Latin Rights; that is, they were to have the same legal status as the many colonies that had been co-founded by Rome and towns of Latium.

The reaction of the region&#x27;s Gauls was swift; they drove the colonists off the lands. Taking refuge in Mutina, the colonists sent for military assistance. A small force under Lucius Manlius was prevented from reaching the area. The Senate then sent two legions under Gaius Atelius. Collecting Manlius and the colonists, they descended on Piacenza and Cremona and successfully placed castra there of to support the building of the city. Piacenza must have been walled immediately, as the walls were in place when the Battle of the Trebia was fought around the city in December. There is no evidence either textual or archaeological of a prior settlement at that exact location; however, such a site would have been obliterated by construction. Piacenza was the fifty-third colony to be placed by Rome following its foundation. It was the first among the Gauls of the Po valley.

It had to be supplied by boat after the Battle of Trebbia, when Hannibal controlled the countryside, for which purpose a port (Emporium) was constructed. In 209 BC, Hasdrubal Barca crossed the Alps and laid siege to the city, but he was unable to take it, and he withdrew. In 200 BC, the Gauls sacked and burned the city, selling the inhabitants into slavery. Subsequently, the victorious Romans restored the city and managed to recover 2,000 of its citizens. In 198 BC, a combined force of Gauls and Ligurians plundered the whole region. As the people had never recovered from being sold into slavery, in 190 BC, they complained to Senate of underpopulation; in response the Senate sent 3,000 new settlers. Construction of the Via Aemilia in the decade of the 180s made the city easily accessible from the Adriatic ports, which improved trade and the prospects for timely defense.

The Liver of Piacenza, a bronze model of a sheep&#x27;s liver for the purposes of haruspicy was discovered in 1877 at Gossolengo just to the south of Piacenza. It bears witness to the survival of the &quot;disciplina Etrusca&quot; well after the Roman conquest.

Although sacked and devastated several times, the city always recovered and by the sixth century Procopius was calling it &quot;the principal city in the country of Aemilia&quot;.

The first Bishop of Piacenza (322–357), San Vittorio, declared Saint Antoninus of Piacenza, a soldier of the Theban Legion (and not to be confused with the sixth-century Antoninus of Piacenza), the patron saint of Piacenza and had the first basilica constructed to honor the saint in 324. The basilica was restored in 903 and rebuilt in 1101, again in 1562, and is still a church today. The remains of the bishop and the soldier-saint are in urns under the altar. The theme of Antoninus, protector of Piacenza, is well known in art.

=== Middle Ages ===

Piacenza was sacked during the course of the Gothic War (535–554). After a short period of being reconquered by the Roman emperor Justinian I, it was conquered by the Lombards, who made it a duchy seat. After its conquest by Francia in the ninth century, the city began to recover, aided by its location along the Via Francigena that later connected the Holy Roman Empire with Rome. Its population and importance grew further after the year 1000. That period marked a gradual transfer of governing powers from the feudal lords to a new enterprising class, as well to the feudal class of the countryside.

In 1095, the city was the site of the Council of Piacenza, in which the First Crusade was proclaimed. From 1126, Piacenza was a free commune and an important member of the Lombard League. In this role, it took part in the war against Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor and in the subsequent battle of Legnano (1176). It also successfully fought the neighbouring communes of Cremona, Pavia, and Parma, expanding its territory. Piacenza also captured control of the trading routes with Genoa, where the first Piacentini bankers had already settled, from the Malaspina counts and the bishop of Bobbio.

In the thirteenth century, despite unsuccessful wars against Frederick I, Piacenza managed to gain strongholds on the Lombardy shore of the Po. The preliminaries of the Peace of Constance were signed in 1183 in the Saint Antoninus church. Agriculture and trade flourished in these centuries and Piacenza became one of the richest cities in Europe. This is reflected in the construction of many important buildings and in the general revision of the urban plan. Struggles for control were commonplace in the second half of the thirteenth century, similarly to the large majority of Medieval Italian communes. The Scotti family, Pallavicini family and (1290–1313) in that order, held power during the period. Scoto&#x27;s government ended when the Visconti of Milan captured Piacenza, which they would hold until 1447. Duke Gian Galeazzo Visconti rewrote Piacenza&#x27;s statutes and relocated the University of Pavia to the city. Piacenza then became a possession of the House of Sforza until 1499.

=== Modern era ===
Chiefly due to the expansion of agriculture in the countryside surrounding Piacenza, the city progressed economically and a coin from the sixteenth century (that is displayed to the right) declares that by featuring the motto: &quot;Placentia floret&quot; (&quot;Piacenza flourishes&quot;) on one of its sides. Also in the course of that century a new city wall was erected. Piacenza, as part of the Duchy of Milan, was ruled, at alternate times, by the Sforza and by France until 1521, when, under Pope Leo X, it became part of the Papal States. From 1545, following the creation of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza by Pope Paul III to his son Pier Luigi Farnese, the city was ruled by the House of Farnese.

Piacenza was the capital city of the duchy until Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma (1547–1586), moved the capital to Parma. The city underwent some of its most difficult years during the rule of Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma (1622–1646). Out of the population of 30,000 in the city between 6,000 and 13,000 Piacentini died from famine and plague. The city and its countryside were ravaged by bandits and French soldiers as well.
Between 1732 and 1859, Parma and Piacenza were ruled by the House of Bourbon. In the eighteenth century, several edifices that belonged to noble families such as Scotti, Landi, and Fogliani were built in Piacenza.

In 1802, Napoleon&#x27;s army annexed Piacenza to the French Empire. Young Piacentini recruits were sent to fight in Russia, Spain, and Germany, while the city was plundered of a great number of artworks that are currently exhibited in many French museums.

The Habsburg government of Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma (1816–1847), is remembered fondly as one of the best in the history of Piacenza. The duchess drained many lands, built several bridges across the Trebbia and the Nure and created educational and artistic activities.

=== Union with Italy ===

Austrian troops occupied Piacenza until, in 1860, a plebiscite marked the entrance of the city into the Kingdom of Sardinia. When 37,089 voters out of 37,585 voted for the annexation, Piacenza was declared &quot;Primogenita dell&#x27;Unità di Italia&quot; (&quot;First-born of the Unification of Italy&quot;) by the monarch. The Piacentini enrolled en masse in Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s army for the Expedition of the Thousand.

In 1858, the geologist Karl Mayer-Eymar named the Piacenzian Age of the Pliocene Epoch based on deposits close to Piacenza.

In June 1865, the first railway bridge over the Po River in northern Italy was inaugurated (in southern Italy a railroad bridge had been built across the river in 1839). In 1891, the first Chamber of Workers was created in Piacenza.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, the city was heavily bombed by the Allies because of its strategic elements. The important railway and road bridges across the Trebbia and the Po and the railway yards were destroyed. The historic centre of city suffered collateral damage. In 1944, the bridges over the Po became vital for the supply from Austria of Field Marshal Albert Kesselring&#x27;s Gothic Line, which protected the withdrawal of Kesselring&#x27;s troops from Italy. Foremost among these were the railway and road bridges at Piacenza, along with supply depots and railway yards. In Operation Mallory Major, July 12–15, allied medium bombers from Corsica flew 300 sorties a day, knocking out 21 bridges east of Piacenza and then continued to the west for a total of 90 by July 20. Fighter-bombers prevented reconstruction and cut roads and rail lines. By August 4, all the cities of northern Italy were isolated and had suffered heavy bombing, especially Piacenza. Transport to Genoa to the south or through Turin to the north was impossible; nevertheless, Kesselring continued to supply his men.

On the hills and the Apennine Mountains, partisans were active. On April 25, 1945, a general partisan insurrection by the Italian resistance movement broke out and on 29 April, troops of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force entered the city. In 1996, president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro honoured Piacenza with the gold medal for Valour in Battle.

There was a prisoner of war (POW) camp located in Piacenza, Veano Camp PG 29.

== Main sights ==
Piacenza boasts a great number of historical palaces, often characterized by splendid gardens.


=== Major palaces of interest ===
==== Secular buildings ====
* &quot;Piazza dei Cavalli&quot;: main square, named (&quot;Cavalli&quot; means &quot;horses&quot;) for the two bronze equestrian monuments, made by the Mannerist sculptor Francesco Mochi and depicting two Farnese Dukes of Parma Alessandro and his son, Ranuccio I. The Piazza is flanked by:
**&quot;Palazzo Comunale&quot;: also known as &quot;il Gotico&quot;, built in 1281 as the town hall or &quot;Broletto&quot;. Only the northern facade was completed in the original design, with Ghibelline merlons, ground arcades made with pink marble, upper floors in brick, and a taller central bell tower. Inside, the frescoed main hall is used for meetings, lectures, and conferences.
**&quot;Palazzo del Collegio dei Mercanti&quot;: (17th century) current town hall
**&quot;Palazzo del Governatore&quot;: neoclassic building, and to the east by the church of San Francesco. Near the Palazzo dei Mercanti are two fascist era buildings.
*&quot;Palazzo Farnese&quot;: begun in 1568 by Ottavio Farnese and his wife, Margaret of Parma. The initial project was designed by Francesco Paciotto, and construction pursued by Giovanni Bernardo Della Valle, Giovanni Lavezzari, and Bernardo Panizzari (Caramosino). The design was modified in 1568 by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, better known as &quot;Vignola&quot;. The Civic Museums of Palazzo Farnese contain the town art gallery (Pinacoteca) and Archaeological Museum which houses the pre-Roman bronze Liver of Piacenza, an Etruscan bronze model of a sheep&#x27;s liver dating from the end of the 2nd to early 1st century BC. The model was discovered in 1877 in the Piacenza hinterland. Containing writing on its surface delineating the various parts of the liver and their significance, it was likely used as an educational tool for students studying haruspicy, or divination.
*&quot;Palazzo Costa&quot;
*&quot;Palazzo Somaglia&quot;
*&quot;Palazzo Baldini&quot;: palace located on Via San Siro
*&quot;Palazzo della Prefettura&quot; or &quot;Palazzo Scotti da Vigoleno&quot;
*Palazzo Ferrari Sacchini

== Dialect ==

Many inhabitants of Piacenza and the surrounding province still use Piacentino, which is a variety of the Emilian dialect the Emilian-Romagnol language. Emilian-Romagnol is a member of a different Romance subfamily (Gallo-Italic) than Standard Italian (which is an Italo-Dalmatian language) and its distinct grammar and phonology make it mutually unintelligible with that language.

Although there have been a number of notable poets and writers using Piacentino, the language has experienced a steady decline during the twentieth century due to the growing standardization of the Italian language in the national educational system.

== Sport ==
Piacenza Calcio 1919 is the main and most supported football team and played in Serie A for eight seasons. They play at the Stadio Leonardo Garilli.

The city&#x27;s other club, Pro Piacenza 1919, declared bankruptcy in 2019.

Volley Piacenza is the main men&#x27;s volleyball team and currently plays in serie A1; its palmares entails a championship, a national cup, a national supercup, and two European cups. River Volley is the main women&#x27;s volleyball team and won the national championship twice.

Rugby is relatively popular compared with Italian standards and Piacenza has a number of rugby teams: Piacenza Rugby Club and Rugby Lyons Piacenza are the most important.

== Cuisine ==

Piacenza and its province are known for the production of seasoned and salted pork products. The main specialities are &quot;pancetta&quot; (rolled seasoned pork belly, salted and spiced), &quot;coppa&quot; (seasoned pork neck, containing less fat than &quot;pancetta&quot;, matured at least for six months), and &quot;salame&quot; (chopped pork meat flavoured with spices and wine, and made into sausages).

&quot;Bortellina&quot; (salted pancakes made with flour, salt, and water or milk) and &quot;chisulén&quot; (&quot;torta fritta&quot; in Standard Italian; made with flour, milk, and animal fats mixed together and then fried in hot &quot;strutto&quot;, or clarified pork fat) are considered the perfect coupling of &quot;pancetta&quot;, &quot;coppa&quot;, and &quot;salame&quot;, but they are also considered good with cheeses, particularly Gorgonzola and Robiola.

&quot;Pisarei e faśö&quot; is a mixture of handmade pasta and borlotti beans. This is served with a sauce made of tomato puree, extra virgin olive oil, onion, salt, and pepper. The dish typically is consumed with grated Parmigiano on top.

Among the culinary specialties of the Piacenza region (although also enjoyed in nearby Cremona) is &quot;mostarda di frutta&quot;, consisting of preserved fruits in a sugary syrup that is strongly flavored with mustard. &quot;Turtlìt&quot; (&quot;tortelli dolci&quot; in standard Italian), or fruit dumplings, are filled with &quot;mostarda di frutta&quot;, mashed chestnuts, and other ingredients, and they are served at Easter. &quot;Turtlìt&quot; are popular in the Ferrara area as well. &quot;Turtéi&quot;, a similarly named Piacentine specialty, is a kind of pasta filled with spinaches and ricotta cheese, or filled with calabash. A similar Piacentine dish is the Panzerotti al Forno, which is made with pasta, ricotta cheese, and spinach.

Piacentine staple foods include corn (generally cooked as polenta) and rice (usually cooked as risotto), both of which are very common across northern Italy. Cheeses, such as Grana Padano, are produced in Piacenza although nearby Parma is more famous for its dairy products.

The hills surrounding Piacenza are known for their vineyards. The wine produced in the area is qualified with a &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; called &quot;Colli Piacentini&quot; (&quot;Hills of Piacenza&quot;). The main wines are &quot;Gutturnio&quot; (red wines, both sparkling and still), &quot;Bonarda&quot; (a red wine, often sparkling and foamy, made from Croatina grapes), &quot;Ortrugo&quot; (a dry white wine), and &quot;Malvasia&quot; (a sweet white wine).

<text>Lawrence Robert Klein (September 14, 1920 – October 20, 2013) was an American economist. For his work in creating computer models to forecast economic trends in the field of econometrics in the Department of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1980 specifically &quot;for the creation of econometric models and their application to the analysis of economic fluctuations and economic policies.&quot; Due to his efforts, such models have become widespread among economists. Harvard University professor Martin Feldstein told the Wall Street Journal that Klein &quot;was the first to create the statistical models that embodied Keynesian economics,&quot; tools still used by the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks.

==Life and career==
Klein was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the son of Blanche (née Monheit) and Leo Byron Klein. He went on to graduate from Los Angeles City College, where he learned calculus; the University of California, Berkeley, where he began his computer modeling and earned a BA in Economics in 1942; he earned his PhD in Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1944, where he was Paul Samuelson&#x27;s first doctoral student.

===Early model-building===
Klein then moved to the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, which was then at the University of Chicago, now the Cowles Foundation. There he built a model of the United States economy to forecast the development of business fluctuations and to study the effects of government economic-political policy. After World War II Klein used his model to correctly predict, against the prevailing expectation, that there would be an economic upturn rather than a depression due to increasing consumer demand from returning servicemen. Similarly, he correctly predicted a mild recession at the end of the Korean War.

Klein briefly joined the Communist Party during the 1940s, which led to trouble years later.

At the University of Michigan, Klein developed enhanced macroeconomic models, in particular the famous Klein–Goldberger model with Arthur Goldberger, which was based on foundations laid by Jan Tinbergen of the Netherlands, later winner of the first economics prize in 1969. Klein differed from Tinbergen in using an alternative economic theory and a different statistical technique.

===McCarthyism and move to England===
In 1954, Klein&#x27;s brief membership in the Communist Party was made public and he was denied tenure at the University of Michigan, in the wake of the McCarthy era. Klein moved to the University of Oxford, and developed an economic model of the United Kingdom known as the Oxford model with Sir James Ball. Additionally, at the Institute of Statistics, Klein assisted with the creation of the British Savings Surveys, based upon the Michigan Surveys.

===Return to the U.S.===
In 1958 Klein returned to the U.S. to join the Department of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1959 he was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal, one of the two most prestigious awards in the field of economics. In 1968 he became the Benjamin Franklin Professor of Economics and Finance at Penn.

===Brookings-SSRC Project===
In the early 1960s Klein became the leader of the major &quot;Brookings-SSRC Project&quot; to construct a detailed econometric model to forecast the short-term development of the U.S. economy.

===Wharton===
Later in the &#x27;60s, Klein constructed the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Model. This model, considerably smaller than the Brookings model, achieved a very good reputation for its analysis of business conditions, used to forecast fluctuations including national product, exports, investments, and consumption, and to study the effect on them of changes in taxation, public expenditure, oil price, etc.

In 1969 Klein founded Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates or WEFA (now IHS Global Insight), launching the econometric forecasting industry in the United States. Among his clients were General Electric Company, IBM, and Bethlehem Steel Corporation. He was the initiator of, and an active research leader in their LINK project, a consortium of model builders from many countries, which was also mentioned in his Nobel citation. The aim was to produce the world&#x27;s first global economic model, linking models of many of the world&#x27;s countries so that the effect of changes in the economy of one country are reflected in the other. LINK, which is now operated by the United Nations, is still meeting regularly, most recently in September 2018 in Santiago, Chile.

Klein served as a thesis advisor for numerous well-known economists including E. Roy Weintraub in the late 1960s.

===Later career===
During the 1976 United States presidential election, Klein coordinated Jimmy Carter&#x27;s economic task force. He declined an invitation to join Carter&#x27;s administration. Klein has also been president of the Econometric Society, the International Atlantic Economic Society (1989–1990), and the American Economic Association (in 1977).

His Nobel citation concludes that &quot;few, if any, research workers in the empirical field of economic science, have had so many successors and such a large impact as Lawrence Klein&quot;. However, Christopher Sims has criticized the assumptions underlying large macro-econometric models built by Klein (Sims, 1980). Also, many economists have questioned the suitability of estimation methods employed by large structural models and the usefulness of simple autoregressive models for approximating economic systems.

In his final years, he was constructing short range &quot;current quarter models&quot; that use current economic indicators to get a handle on the rate of economic growth during the current and next quarter. In contrast to earlier efforts to model the economy structurally and to use constant adjustments and judgmental estimates for the exogenous variables, these systems are deliberately automatic and mechanical, simply translating available information into a statistically best estimate of current conditions. This represents a very different tradition from his earlier model building and applications.

After formal retirement and until his death he was engaged in macro econometric model building high-frequency models that project the economy within a short timeframe (e.g., monthly or quarterly). A publication on high frequency model containing regions such as US, China, Russia, India, Brazil, Mexico, Korea and Hong Kong was expected in 2008.

Klein was a founding trustee of Economists for Peace and Security. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the United States National Academy of Sciences.

He died at the age of 93 in his home on October 20, 2013.

<doc id="240096" wikidata="Q829876" url="?curid=240096" title="Photokeratitis">
<text>Photokeratitis or ultraviolet keratitis is a painful eye condition caused by exposure of insufficiently protected eyes to the ultraviolet (UV) rays from either natural (e.g. intense direct or reflected sunlight) or artificial (e.g. the electric arc during welding) sources. Photokeratitis is akin to a sunburn of the cornea and conjunctiva. 

The injury may be prevented by wearing eye protection that blocks most of the ultraviolet radiation, such as welding goggles with the proper filters, a welder&#x27;s helmet, sunglasses rated for sufficient UV protection, or appropriate snow goggles. The condition is usually managed by removal from the source of ultraviolet radiation, covering the corneas, and administration of pain relief. Photokeratitis is known by a number of different terms, including snow blindness, arc eye, welder&#x27;s flash, sand eyes, bake eyes, corneal flash burns, flash burns, niphablepsia, or keratoconjunctivitis photoelectrica.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Common symptoms include pain, intense tears, eyelid twitching, discomfort from bright light, and constricted pupils.

== Cause ==
Any intense exposure to UV light can lead to photokeratitis. In 2010, the Department of Optometry at the Dublin Institute of Technology published that the threshold for photokeratitis is 0.12 J/m2. (Prior to this, in 1975, the Division of Biological Effects at the US Bureau of Radiological Health had published that the human threshold for photokeratitis is 50 J/m2.) Common causes include welding with failure to use adequate eye protection such as an appropriate welding helmet or welding goggles. This is termed &quot;arc eye&quot;, while photokeratitis caused by exposure to sunlight reflected from ice and snow, particularly at elevation, is commonly called &quot;snow blindness&quot;. It can also occur due to using tanning beds without proper eyewear. Natural sources include bright sunlight reflected from snow or ice or, less commonly, from sea or sand. Fresh snow reflects about 80% of the UV radiation compared to a dry, sandy beach (15%) or sea foam (25%). This is especially a problem in polar regions and at high altitudes, as with about every of elevation (above sea level), the intensity of ultraviolet rays increases by four percent.

== Diagnosis ==
Fluorescein dye staining will reveal damage to the cornea under ultraviolet light.

== Prevention ==

Photokeratitis can be prevented by using sunglasses or eye protection that transmits 5–10% of visible light and absorbs almost all UV rays. Additionally, these glasses should have large lenses and side shields to avoid incidental light exposure. Sunglasses should always be worn, even when the sky is overcast, as UV rays can pass through clouds.

Inuit, Yupik, and other circumpolar peoples have carved snow goggles from materials such as driftwood or antlers of caribou to help prevent snow blindness for millennia. Curved to fit the user&#x27;s face with a large groove cut in the back to allow for the nose, the goggles allow in a small amount of light through a long thin slit cut along their length. The goggles are held to the head by a cord made of caribou sinew.
In the event of missing sunglass lenses, emergency lenses can be made by cutting slits in dark fabric or tape folded back onto itself. The &quot;SAS Survival Guide&quot; recommends blackening the skin underneath the eyes with charcoal (as the ancient Egyptians did) to avoid any further reflection.

=== Arctic and Antarctic explorers ===
Explorers of the polar regions employed various methods and materials to protect their eyes from the harsh glare in snowy environments. Edward Evans noted the popularity of yellow and orange-tinted glasses among explorers, though some showed a preference for green. Despite the availability of blue and purple glasses, Edward L. Atkinson advised that all glasses, regardless of colour, should undergo spectroscope testing to ensure effectiveness.

Robert Falcon Scott favoured a more rudimentary approach, opting for goggles crafted from leather or wood with narrow slits, which prevented the accumulation of frost. A similar design principle was also applied in emergency situations, such as when the Swedish expedition, after being shipwrecked, fashioned makeshift goggles from wood or wire frames covered with fabric from a Swedish flag.

The Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s guidance for travellers included a technique used by indigenous peoples of high-altitude regions, which involved darkening the skin around the eyes and nose to mitigate the risk of snow blindness. This method was adopted by the Terra Nova northern party in the absence of traditional goggles.

The impact of snow blindness extended to animals as well; the expedition’s horses suffered from the condition. Lawrence Oates proposed dyeing the horses’ forelocks as a preventative measure, and they were also equipped with tassels over their eyes for protection. Similarly, mules were provided with canvas snow goggles, demonstrating the breadth of strategies developed to combat this pervasive issue during polar exploration.

== Treatment ==
The pain may be temporarily alleviated with anaesthetic eye drops for the examination; however, they are not used for continued treatment, as anaesthesia of the eye interferes with corneal healing, and may lead to corneal ulceration and even loss of the eye. In the 1900s polar explorers treated snow blindness by dripping cocaine into the eye. Cool, wet compresses over the eyes and artificial tears may help local symptoms when the feeling returns. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) eyedrops are widely used to lessen inflammation and eye pain, but have not been proven in rigorous trials. Systemic (oral) pain medication is given if discomfort is severe. Healing is usually rapid (24–72 hours) if the injury source is removed. Further injury should be avoided by isolation in a dark room, removing contact lenses, not rubbing the eyes, and wearing sunglasses until the symptoms improve.

<text>Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, Inc (WEFA Inc) was an economics forecasting and consulting organization founded by Nobel Prize winner Lawrence Klein.

WEFA Inc was a spinoff of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where Klein taught. WEFA Inc traced an interesting path (see below for full details) from its predecessor in 1961 (the Economic Research Unit, discussed below), its initial launch in 1969 (as Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates Inc), to its ultimate merger with DRI (formerly Data Resources Inc.) forming Global Insight in 2001, and subsequent to that, Global Insight&#x27;s acquisition in 2008 by IHS Inc.

==Origins==
Incorporated in 1969 by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania as a &quot;not for profit&quot; organization, WEFA Inc was an outgrowth of the Economics Research Unit (ERU) located in the economics department of the University of Pennsylvania. The ERU, a research unit devoted to graduate economics education, was originally sponsored in 1961 by grants from five US corporations including, IBM, Bethlehem Steel, John Deere, Exxon and Sunoco.

Among other things, the ERU was originally charged with the maintenance and use of the Wharton Quarterly Model [WQM] and the Wharton Index of Capacity Utilization. Between 1961 and 1969 the number of sponsors increased to the point where a more efficient organization was needed [WEFA Inc] to manage the many projects that grew out of the operation of the Wharton Quarterly Model.

==Leadership==
In June 1969, when WEFA Inc was incorporated, Lawrence R. Klein was appointed board chairman, Michael D. McCarthy was appointed executive director, and the then Director of the ERU, F. G. Adams, was appointed secretary-treasurer. Other members of the Board were: The Dean of the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, ex officio, The Chairman of the Department of Economics of the University of Pennsylvania, ex officio, Paul F. Miller, (Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania), Michael K. Evans (University of Pennsylvania, economics department), Paul Taubman (University of Pennsylvania, economics department), and Richard J. Kruizenga,(Chief Economist and Manager, Corporate and Environmental Economics, Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey).

Michael D. McCarthy served as executive director from June 1969 to December 1970. After joining WEFA Inc as Director of Industrial Research in August 1969, Ross S. Preston was appointed a board member and executive director of WEFA Inc in December 1970.

Preston served as executive director until the spring of 1975, at which time he was appointed secretary-treasurer of WEFA Inc. During Preston&#x27;s tenure as executive director, WEFA Inc not only expanded its sponsorship of the Wharton Quarterly Model [WQM], but also developed the Wharton Annual and Industry Forecasting Model [WAIFM] which integrated input-output theory within the structure of a macro-econometric model. The predecessor of WAIFM was the Brookings Quarterly Model, originally funded by the Social Science Research Council.

The LINK project (also housed at WEFA Inc), which produced the world&#x27;s first global macroeconomic model, was mentioned in Klein&#x27;s citation for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1980.

==Distribution rights==
The various organization which acquired the rights to distribute WQM and WAIFM include: 
* 1961-69 Economics Research Unit (University of Pennsylvania) distributes the Wharton Quarterly Model; 
* 1969 University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees (WEFA Inc is incorporated and takes over distribution of the Wharton Quarterly Model); 
* 1969 WEFA Inc begins distribution of the Wharton Annual and Industry Forecasting Model; 
* 1980 Ziff-Davis Publishing Co. acquires WEFA Inc; 
* 1983 Cie International de Services en Informatique acquires WEFA Inc; 
* 1986 WEF Associates AG acquires WEFA Inc; 
* 1987 WEF Associates AG acquires Chase Econometrics, WEFA Inc becomes WEFA-CEIS; 
* 1994 Information Partners (Bain Capital) acquires WEFA-CEIS; 
* 1997 Primark Corporation acquires WEFA-CEIS; 
* 2000 The Thomson Corporation acquires Primark Corporation; 
* 2001 Global Insight acquires WEFA-CEIS from The Thomson Corporation and merges it with DRI; 
* 2008 IHS Inc. acquires Global Insight.

==General corporate timeline==
*June 13, 1969: Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates is founded as a non-profit organization wholly owned by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. 
*July 14, 1979: McGraw-Hill announces it plans to buy Data Resources, a major competitor of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates for about $103 million. 
*December 18, 1979: It is announced that University of Pennsylvania plans to sell its controlling interest in Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, and has held talks with three potential buyers.

*June 12, 1980: Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., a privately held publishing and broadcasting company, purchased Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates Inc. from the University of Pennsylvania for an undisclosed amount. The University said it retained a minority interest. Ziff announced that Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates would be the cornerstone of a new company, Strategic Information, which planned to spend tens of millions of dollars in the next five to six years to acquire state of the art computer equipment, according to Dennis O&#x27;Brien, who was named COO and Executive Vice President.
*March 18, 1983: Cie International de Services en Informatique (CISI), a computer firm owned by the French government, acquires an 80 percent interest in Wharton Econometrics from Ziff Davis Publishing Co, and an option to buy the remaining 20 percent in 1985. At the time, Wharton Econometrics is expected to generate revenue of US$8 million in 1983.
*June 20, 1983: CISI Wharton, part of the French CEA, announces plans to invest US$12 million over the next three years to position the newly enlarged entity as one of the world&#x27;s leading economic forecasters.

*November 16, 1986: It is announced that WEF Associates, a group of European investors (the Salem family) advised by M Gerard Vila, would acquire CISI Wharton. At the time, CISI Wharton was described as having generated losses of FFr 100m in 1984-85 on revenue of FFr 94m, and employing 200 people.

*April 1, 1987: WEF Associates AG, the parent of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, announced that it acquired Chase Econometrics from Chase Manhattan Bank N.A., a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp, and that the new entity would be called WEFA-CEIS, Wharton Consulting and Economic Consulting and Economic Information Services. Chase Econometrics had been founded by Michael Kaye Evans, who had previously collaborated with Klein at Wharton but parted ways. An earlier magazine article had described Wharton Econometrics as &quot;austere and academic&quot;, Data Resources as &quot;cerebral and expanding&quot;, and Chase as &quot;outspoken and controversial&quot;. Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Chase Econometrics, became chairman and CEO, of the new business, while Lawrence Klein was positioned to act as a consultant and continue to oversee the board.

*April 11, 1987: Wharton Econometrics and Chase Econometrics agreed to call the merged companies Wharton Economics rather than the originally proposed name, WEFA-CEIS. According to the CEO Lawrence Chimerin, the term &quot;econometrics&quot; was dropped, because the consolidated company would broaden its services from econometric modeling to areas such as financial analysis, planning support, and software development.

*August 2, 1994: Information Partners, a private investment group affiliated with Bain Capital and focused on investments and acquisitions in the information services marketplace, announced that it had completed the purchase of The WEFA Group. The transaction was later valued at US$20 million.

*January 16, 1997: Primark Corporation, headed by chairman and CEO Joseph E. Kasputys, announced it entered into an agreement to acquire WEFA Holdings Inc. from Bain Capital Inc. and other shareholders in a US$45 million cash transaction. According to Primark, WEFA had revenues of about US$29 million in 1996 and was profitable. It was also reported that in selling WEFA, Information Partners had earned a ninefold return on its August 1994 acquisition. In its press release, Primark said Allen Sinai was named to the new position as WEFA&#x27;s chief global economist, and that William Mundell would continue as WEFA&#x27;s president and chief executive.

*Early-1997 to June 1998: Primark holds discussions with several prospective buyers, including Reed Elsevier. Reed Elsevier withdrew its offer while it dealt with a possible merger with Wolters Kluwer.

*June 5, 2000: The Thomson Corporation announced that it would acquire Primark Corporation. At this point, Primark&#x27;s key brands included A-T Financial Information, Baseline, Disclosure, Datastream, Global Access, GlobalTOPIC, I/B/E/S, MarketEye, PIMS, WEFA, Worldscope and Vestek. Thomson announced that it was looking at how it could integrate Primark&#x27;s offerings with its own brands such as ILX and First Call. The deal came as a further sign of Thomson&#x27;s moves to extract itself from some of its traditional operations such as small-circulation newspapers to move toward electronic-based business. It was announced that Thomson was acquiring Primark for approximately US$842 million, and the assumption of $235 million in Primark debt, while Primark had 1999 revenues of $495 million. Joseph E. Kasputys, Primark&#x27;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, became Chairman of Thomson Financial.

*March 2001: Joseph Kasputys forms Global Insight, Inc. to be a leading company providing business executives, investors and government officials with economic information, analysis and solutions.

*May 7, 2001: Global Insight announced it would acquire DRI and WEFA from their respective parent companies to form its first subsidiary, DRI-WEFA Inc. DRI, formerly known as Data Resources Inc. was at this point a unit of The McGraw-Hill Companies, a New York publisher and financial services company, while WEFA was a unit of The Thomson Corporation, a Toronto diversified information company. Joseph Kasputys was the chairman and main shareholder in Global Insight and led the acquisition. At the time of the merger, Kasputys, who had previous roles as a senior executive of both WEFA and DRI, said that he had wanted to bring together DRI and WEFA since 1990. Kasputys had also been executive vice president of McGraw-Hill until 1987. At the point of the merger, WEFA had about 220 employees and DRI about 250. At its peak, DRI, the larger of the two, had brought in US$100 million in revenue. Including new subsidiaries Primark Decision Economics; DAFSA, a European market research company; and Primark Poland, a software development company; Global Insight was planned to employ about 500, have 30 offices world wide, and have annual revenue of $70 million.
*2005: Global Insight reportedly generates revenue of US$86 million.
*September 18, 2008: Global Insight announces that it will be acquired by IHS Inc., a Colorado-based public company that supplies information on energy, the environment, security, and product life cycles. The acquisition closed on October 13, 2008 for US$165 million, consisting of $118 million in cash and IHS common stock valued at $47 million. In the announcement, Global Insight&#x27;s 2008 revenues were reported at an estimated $120 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the high single-digits. The deal anticipated the benefits of adding Global Insight to IHS&#x27; insight units, including Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Jane&#x27;s Information Group, and IHS Herold&#x27;s. At this point, Global Insight is renamed to IHS Global Insight and reportedly has 700 employees in 25 global offices.

<text>Oi Polloi are a punk rock band from Scotland that formed around 1981. Starting as an Oi! band, they are now generally more associated with the anarcho-punk genre. The band has become notable for their contributions to the Scottish Gaelic punk subgenre. The name comes from the Greek expression &quot;οἱ πολλοί&quot;, Anglicized &quot;hoi polloi&quot;, meaning &quot;the masses&quot; or &quot;the common people&quot;.

The band has gone through about 50 members since their formation, and their only permanent member has been vocalist Deek Allen, who has also been involved in Gaelic-language television. The band has included punks and skinheads. The members have been supporters of Anti-Fascist Action and Earth First!, and they use the motto &quot;No Compromise in Defence of Our Earth,&quot; which is an adaptation of Earth First!&#x27;s motto. They support direct action in defence of the environment, hunt sabotage, as well as resistance against racism, sexism, homophobia, fascism and imperialism. They are also supporters of Linux and criticized Microsoft in their song, L.I.N.U.X.

==Career==

After gigs in the Edinburgh area and the recording of the band&#x27;s self-recorded first cassette demo, &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;, drummer Stu &quot;Doccy&quot; Dunn left to become a karate instructor. A second studio demo, &quot;Green Anarchoi&quot; and their first vinyl EP, &quot;Resist the Atomic Menace&quot;, followed.

Oi Polloi started singing in Scottish Gaelic in 1996, recording the &quot;Carson?&quot; EP, (2003), then recording and releasing the full-length LP &quot;Ar Ceòl Ar Cànan Ar-A-Mach&quot; in 2006. The band members also use Scottish Gaelic in day-to-day communications.

In 2013, they collaborated with CLÀR, a Scottish Gaelic publisher, to launch &quot;Air Cuan Dubh Drilseach&quot;, a Gaelic science fiction novel by Tim Armstrong, the singer of Mill a h-Uile Rud, at events at Elvis Shakespeare on Leith Walk and on The Cruz Boat at the shore in Leith.

==Legacy and influence==
In an interview with The Guardian in 2016, the band was cited along with a number of other British Anarcho-punk bands of the early 80s as being an influence to the American avant-garde metal group Neurosis.

<text>Henry Dearborn (February 23, 1751 – June 6, 1829) was an American military officer and politician. In the Revolutionary War, he served under Benedict Arnold in his expedition to Quebec, of which his journal provides an important record. After being captured and exchanged, he served in George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army. He was present at the British surrender at Yorktown. Dearborn served on General George Washington&#x27;s staff in Virginia.

He served as Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson, from 1801 to 1809, and served as a commanding general in the War of 1812. In later life, his criticism of General Israel Putnam&#x27;s performance at the Battle of Bunker Hill caused a major controversy. Fort Dearborn in Illinois, Dearborn County in Indiana, and the city of Dearborn, Michigan, were named in his honor.

==Early life==
Henry Dearborn was born February 23, 1751, to Simon Dearborn and Sarah Marston in North Hampton in the Province of New Hampshire. He was descended from Godfrey Dearborn, from Exeter in England, who came to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1639. Godfrey Dearborn settled first at Exeter, New Hampshire, and soon after at Hampton, where four successive generations of his descendants lived. Henry spent much of his youth in Epping, where he attended public schools. He grew up as an athletic boy, notably strong and a champion wrestler. He studied medicine under Dr. Hall Jackson of Portsmouth and opened a practice on the square in Nottingham, New Hampshire, in 1772.

Dearborn was married three times: to Mary Bartlett in 1771, to Dorcas (Osgood) Marble in 1780, and to Sarah Bowdoin, widow of James Bowdoin, in 1813. Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn was his son by his second wife.

==Revolutionary War service==
When fighting in the American Revolutionary War began, Dearborn fought with the Continental Army as a captain in the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments; he soon rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was appointed Deputy Quartermaster General in July 1781 and served on George Washington&#x27;s staff while in Virginia. At age twenty-three, he organized and led a local militia troop of sixty men to the Boston area, where he fought on June 17, 1775, at the Battle of Bunker Hill as a captain in Colonel John Stark&#x27;s 1st New Hampshire Regiment. During the battle, Dearborn observed that &quot;Not an officer or soldier of the continental troops engaged was in uniform, but were in the plain and ordinary dress of citizens; nor was there an officer on horseback.&quot; Dearborn years later would accuse Israel Putnam of failing his duty during that battle, resulting in what has since been known as the Dearborn-Putnam controversy.

Dearborn volunteered to serve under Colonel Benedict Arnold in September 1775, during the difficult American expedition to Quebec. Later Dearborn would record in his Revolutionary War journal their overall situation and condition: &quot;We were small indeed to think of entering a place like Quebec. But being now almost out of provisions we were sure to die if we attempted to return back and we could be in no worse situation if we proceeded on our rout.&quot;

On the final leg of the march, Dearborn was taken seriously ill with fever, forcing him to remain behind in a cottage on the Chaudière River. Later he rejoined the combined forces of Arnold and Gen. Richard Montgomery in time to take part in the assault on Quebec. Dearborn&#x27;s journal is an important record for that campaign. During the march he and Aaron Burr became companions. Along with a number of other officers, Dearborn was captured on December 31, 1775, during the Battle of Quebec, and detained for a year. He was released on parole in May 1776, but he was not exchanged until March 1777.

After fighting at Ticonderoga in July 1777, Dearborn was appointed major in the regiment commanded by Alexander Scammell.

In September 1777, he took part in the Saratoga campaign against Burgoyne at Freeman&#x27;s Farm. The first battle was largely fought by troops from New Hampshire, Dearborn&#x27;s home state. The New Hampshire brigade under General Poor and a detachment of infantry under Major Dearborn, numbering about three hundred, along with detachments of other militia, and Whitcomb&#x27;s Rangers, co-operated with Morgan in the repulse of Fraser&#x27;s attack. The cautious General Horatio Gates reluctantly ordered a reconnaissance force consisting of Daniel Morgan&#x27;s Provisional Rifle Corps and Dearborn&#x27;s light infantry to scout out the Bemis Heights area. Gates later noted Dearborn&#x27;s marked ability as a soldier and officer in his report. Thereafter Dearborn joined General George Washington&#x27;s main Continental Army at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, as a lieutenant colonel, where he spent the winter of 1777–1778.

Dearborn fought at the Battle of Monmouth in New Jersey in 1778, following the British evacuation of Philadelphia to retreat to concentrate at New York City, in the final major battle of the Northern Theatre, and in the summer of 1779 he accompanied Major General John Sullivan on the Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois in upstate New York and in the Battle of Newtown against the Six Nations, thereafter laying waste to the Genesee Valley and the various regions around the Finger Lakes.

During the winter of 1778–1779, he was encamped at what is now Putnam Memorial State Park in Redding, Connecticut. Dearborn rejoined General Washington&#x27;s staff in 1781 as deputy quartermaster general and commanded the 1st New Hampshire at the siege of Yorktown with the rank of colonel and was present when Cornwallis surrendered in October of that year.

In June 1783, Dearborn received his discharge from the Continental Army and settled in Gardiner, Maine, where he became Major General of the Maine militia. Washington appointed him marshal of the District of Maine. Dearborn served in the U.S. House of Representatives from the District of Maine, 1793 to 1797. He was an original member of the New Hampshire Society of the Cincinnati.

===Revolutionary War journals===

During the American Revolution Dearborn maintained six separate journals where he recorded the various campaigns, battles, and other notable events from his point of experience. His &quot;Revolutionary War journals of Henry Dearborn, 1775-1783&quot;, have provided historians of early American history with valuable first-hand information from the perspective of an officer who was engaged in the various battles and surrounding events. His journals were first published in 1939 by the Caxton Club of Chicago and were edited from the original manuscripts by historians Lloyd A. Brown and Howard Henry Peckham; the publication includes a biographical essay of Dearborn by Hermon D. Smith. The six journals are enumerated as follows:

Dearborn also wrote &quot;An Account of the Battle of Bunker Hill&quot;. Various scholars have cited the short work as being culturally important and greatly contributing to the knowledge base of early American history.

==Post-Revolution==

Dearborn was commissioned as a brigadier general in the Massachusetts Militia in 1787 and was promoted to major general in 1789. The same year he was appointed as the first U.S. Marshal for the District of Maine under the new Constitution of 1787 by President Washington. He represented this district as a Democratic-Republican in the Third and Fourth Congresses from 1793 to 1797, when he lost re-election to Isaac Parker. Dearborn attempted to return to his former congressional seat in 1798 and 1800, losing both times to Silas Lee, who had succeeded Parker after one term. 

In 1801, third President Thomas Jefferson appointed Dearborn Secretary of War, a post he held for eight years until March 7, 1809. Dearborn advised Jefferson in matters of military personnel when Jefferson was formulating the Military Peace Establishment Act in 1800-01, which outlined a new set of laws and limits for the military and also led to the founding of a national military academy at West Point. In April 1801, Dearborn asked George Baron, an Englishman who was Dearborn&#x27;s friend from Maine, to be the mathematics instructor at the academy. Dearborn also offered the superintendency of the school to Jonathan Williams, who had translated into English some European treatises on artillery and fortification.

During the 1801 and 1802 period, Dearborn and Jefferson corresponded frequently, discussing various political and military matters. Notable among them was Dearborn&#x27;s report of May 12, 1801 on the War Department, and his recommendation for &quot;designating the boundary line between the United States, and the adjacent British possessions, in such manner as may prevent any disputes in future...&quot;

During his tenure, he helped Jefferson form a policy on Native Americans, the goal being to establish a western boundary by procuring lands along the Mississippi River.

In 1805, while events in the Burr conspiracy were beginning to unfold, Aaron Burr and Louisiana Territory governor James Wilkinson were allegedly planning war with Mexico, with the aim of establishing a secessionist state in the Southwest in the process. Hoping to incite war with Spain, Wilkinson in a letter to Secretary of War Dearborn urged him to attack Western Spanish Florida from Baton Rouge. Prompted by prevailing rumors of war, Dearborn ordered him to send three companies of troops to Fort Adams in Western Florida as a precaution. The prospect of war in turn was used by Wilkinson to justify sending an exploratory military expedition into the Southwest to find a route that would be used to supply a war effort at the U.S.-Spanish-Mexican border. In May, Dearborn ordered Wilkinson to the Orleans territory, directing his general to &quot;repel any invasion of the United States east of the Sabine River or north or west of the bounds of what has been called West Florida...&quot; Dearborn further maintained that any such movements across these borders would constitute &quot;an actual invasion of our territorial rights&quot;. This was the opportunity both Burr and Wilkinson were hoping for, thinking that Spanish officials were on edge over the prospect of confrontation with the U.S. and could easily be provoked into war. When Wilkinson, however, had asked Dearborn to send an exploratory military expedition into the Southwest, Dearborn replied that, &quot;you, Burr, etc., are becoming too intimate ... keep every suspicious person at arm&#x27;s length.&quot; At this time Dearborn also warned his top general that &quot;your name has very frequently been mentioned with Burr&#x27;s.&quot; Shortly thereafter Burr was arrested for treason.

Dearborn was appointed collector of the port of Boston by President James Madison in March 1809, a position he held until January 27, 1812, when he was appointed as the Commanding General of the United States Army.

==War of 1812==

During the War of 1812, while President Madison was urging Federalists to join in &quot;united support&quot; against Britain in a war they were given little reason to cooperate in, he gave Henry Dearborn senior command of the northeast sector which ranged from the Niagara River to the New England coast. Dearborn had favor with Madison as a Revolutionary War veteran who rose to the rank of colonel and for serving as Secretary of War under President Jefferson, and especially for helping Jefferson draft the Military Peace Establishment Act, which served to remove many Federalist officers from the ranks of the military. Subsequently, Madison&#x27;s choice for commanding general of the northeast theater was not well received by most Federalists. At age 61, however, Dearborn was now overweight, slow and insecure, and he found it difficult to inspire confidence among the men under his command. In March he suffered a minor injury from a fall, and it is suggested that Dearborn took his time recovering. When the war broke out he spent even more time in Boston, fearing, as did Vice President Elbridge Gerry, that the Federalists were once again plotting a northeastern secession and ready to install a &quot;Hanoverian&quot;-like monarchy in opposition to them.

Needing to present Congress with reports of progress, Secretary of War William Eustis urged Dearborn to promptly embark for Albany and plan and make preparations for an invasion of Montreal in Canada. Dearborn maintained, however, that he must first get to New England and secure the militia for defending the New England coast, which would free up the regular troops of the region for the coming campaign against Canada, and before the Federalists effected an open revolt there. After disputes with New England&#x27;s several Federalist governors, who refused to supply the militia for coastal defense, Dearborn reluctantly left New England for Albany with regular troops in late July, leaving the coast almost defenseless against British coastal attacks.

On August 9, while General William Hull was expecting a diversionary attack by Dearborn in the Niagara area, the latter was still at his headquarters at Greenbush, just outside of Albany, and was having great difficulty amassing troops for the coming offensive in Canada. At this time George Prévost had sent British Colonel Edward Baynes to negotiate a temporary armistice with Dearborn. Dearborn learned that Lord Liverpool was giving the American government time to respond. Lacking the means to adequately engage the British in Canada, Dearborn was not eager for battle, welcomed the delay, and rushed news of the armistice to Madison for approval. In the meantime Dearborn gave orders to General Van Rensselaer to avoid any engagements along the Niagara. The truce, however, was short-lived when on August 15 Madison repudiated Dearborn&#x27;s agreement and orders were issued to renew the offensive.
Dearborn prepared plans for simultaneous assaults on Montreal, Kingston, Fort Niagara, and Amherstburg, but the execution was imperfect. A half-hearted advance into Lower Canada in November 1812 simply collapsed after a very minor engagement at the Battle of Lacolle Mills. Some scholars believe that Dearborn also did not move quickly enough to provide sufficient troops to defend Detroit. Hull, without firing a shot, surrendered the city to British General Isaac Brock. Hull was court-martialed and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted. Dearborn headed the court martial.

On April 27, 1813, American forces on Lake Ontario under Dearborn and Commodore Isaac Chauncey gained success at the Battle of York, occupying the town for several days and capturing many guns and stores. Thereafter the American army was transported across the lake in Chauncey&#x27;s ships to Fort Niagara. Dearborn assembled 4,500 troops at Fort Niagara and planned to attack Fort George next, and entrusted the attack to Colonel Winfield Scott, but his army required rest and reorganization. No preparations had been made to accommodate the troops at Fort Niagara, and they suffered considerable shortages and privations for several days.

Although Dearborn had minor successes at the capture of York (now Toronto) on April 27, 1813, and at the capture of Fort George on May 27, 1813, his command was, for the most part, ineffective. He was recalled from the frontier on July 6, 1813, and reassigned to an administrative command in New York City, and married his third wife, Sarah Bowdoin.

Dearborn was honorably discharged from the Army on June 15, 1815.

==Later life==
Dearborn was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816, now the oldest historical society in the United States.

Dearborn ran for Governor of Massachusetts in 1818 against incumbent John Brooks. Because Dearborn was a Democratic-Republican in a predominantly Federalist state, he needed favorable press to help his campaign. Subsequently, Dearborn accepted an offer from Charles Miner, the editor of &quot;The Port Folio&quot;, a Philadelphia political magazine, asking him to verify and edit a British soldier&#x27;s map depicting the Battle of Bunker Hill. Dearborn saw this as a chance to win public favor and seized the opportunity. However, his efforts backfired when he also wrote a &quot;correct account&quot; of the battle in the article, which was reprinted in 1818, accusing Israel Putnam of inaction and cowardly leadership during the battle, which sparked a major and long-lasting controversy among veterans of the war and various historians.

On March 1, 1815, President James Madison nominated Dearborn for reappointment as Secretary of War, but the Senate rejected the nomination, and in the face of fierce criticism over Dearborn&#x27;s performance during the War of 1812, Madison withdrew the nomination. Dearborn was later appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Portugal by President James Monroe, serving from May 7, 1822, until June 30, 1824, when, by his own request, he was recalled.

He retired to his home in Roxbury, Massachusetts, where he died in 1829. He is interred in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain (outside of Boston at the time; annexed to the city in 1874).

==Legacy==
Lewis and Clark, appointed by Thomas Jefferson, named the Dearborn River in west-central Montana after Dearborn in 1803. Dearborn County, Indiana; Dearborn, Michigan; and Dearborn, Missouri, were also named for him, as was Fort Dearborn in Chicago, which in turn was the namesake for Dearborn Street, a major street in downtown Chicago. There was also a Fort Dearborn in Adams County, Mississippi, in the early 1800s; see Leonard Covington.

Augusta, Maine, was so renamed after Henry&#x27;s daughter, Augusta Dearborn, in August 1797.

A U.S. military armory, initially named &quot;Mount Dearborn&quot;, was planned in the early 1800s to be built on an island near the confluence of the Catawba and Wateree rivers, adjacent to Great Falls, South Carolina. The facility was never constructed, but the island name stuck, and after the town was founded in 1905, its main thoroughfare was named Dearborn Street.

During World War II, a coastal defense fort named Fort Dearborn was established in Henry Dearborn&#x27;s home state of New Hampshire, to guard the approaches to Portsmouth.

General Dearborn&#x27;s son, Henry A. S. Dearborn, was a U.S. congressman representing Massachusetts&#x27;s 10th congressional district from 1831 to 1833.

<text>Room temperature, colloquially, denotes the range of air temperatures most people find comfortable indoors while dressed in typical clothing. Comfortable temperatures can be extended beyond this range depending on humidity, air circulation, and other factors.

In certain fields, like science and engineering, and within a particular context, room temperature can mean different agreed-upon ranges. In contrast, ambient temperature is the actual temperature, as measured by a thermometer, of the air (or other medium and surroundings) in any particular place. The ambient temperature (e.g. an unheated room in winter) may be very different from an ideal &quot;room temperature&quot;.

Food and beverages may be served at &quot;room temperature&quot;, meaning neither heated nor cooled.

==Comfort temperatures==

Comfort temperature is interchangeable with neutral temperature in the scientific literature, which can be calculated through regression analysis between thermal sensation votes and indoor temperature. The neutral temperature is the solution of the resulting regression model by setting the thermal sensation vote as zero. &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot; identifies room temperature as around , while the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that it is &quot;conventionally taken as about &quot;.

Ideal room temperature varies vastly depending on the surrounding climate. Studies from Indonesia have shown that the range of comfortable temperature is for local residents. Studies from Nigeria show a comfortable temperature range of , comfortably cool and comfortably warm . A field study conducted in Hyderabad, India returned a comfort band of with a mean of . A study conducted in Jaipur, India among healthy young men showed that the neutral thermal comfort temperature was analyzed to be , although a range of was found.

People are highly sensitive to even small differences in environmental temperature. At , a difference of can be detected between the temperature of two rooms. 

Owing to variations in humidity and (likely) clothing, recommendations for summer and winter may vary; a suggested typical range for summer is , with that for winter being . Some studies have suggested that thermal comfort preferences of men and women may differ significantly, with women on average preferring higher ambient temperatures.

In the recent past, it was common for house temperatures to be kept below the comfort level; a 1978 UK study found average indoor home temperatures to be while Japan in 1980 had median home temperatures of to .

Rooms may be maintained at an ambient temperature above the comfort temperature in hot weather, or below it in cold weather, if required by cost considerations or practical issues (e.g. lack of air conditioning or relatively high expense of heating.)

In the UK, the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963 provides for a minimum temperature in commercial premises, but not for a maximum temperature.

==Health effects==
The World Health Organization in 1987 found that comfortable indoor temperatures of were not associated with health risks for healthy adults with appropriate clothing, humidity, and other factors. For infants, elderly, and those with significant health problems, a minimum of was recommended. Temperatures lower than with humidity above 65% were associated with respiratory hazards including allergies.

The WHO&#x27;s 2018 guidelines give a strong recommendation that a minimum of is a &quot;safe and well-balanced indoor temperature to protect the health of general populations during cold seasons&quot;. A higher minimum temperature may be necessary for vulnerable groups including children, the elderly, and people with cardiorespiratory disease and other chronic illnesses. However, the recommendation regarding risk of exposure to high indoor temperatures is only &quot;conditional&quot;. Minimal-risk high temperatures range from about depending on the region, with maximum acceptable temperatures between .

==Definitions in science and industry==
Temperature ranges are defined as &quot;room temperature&quot; for certain products and processes in industry, science, standards, and consumer goods. For instance, for the shipping and storage of pharmaceuticals, the United States Pharmacopeia-National Formulary (USP-NF) defines &quot;controlled room temperature&quot; as between , with excursions between allowed, provided the mean kinetic temperature does not exceed . The European Pharmacopoeia defines it as being simply , and the Japanese Pharmacopeia defines &quot;ordinary temperature&quot; as , with room temperature being . Merriam-Webster gives as a medical definition a range of as being suitable for human occupancy, and at which laboratory experiments are usually performed.

<doc id="240107" wikidata="Q3959179" url="?curid=240107" title="Shar (file format)">
<text>In the Unix operating system, shar (from &quot;shell archive&quot;) is an archive format created with the Unix codice_1 utility. A shar file is a type of self-extracting archive, because it is a valid shell script, and executing it will recreate the files. To extract the files, only the standard Unix Bourne shell &quot;sh&quot; is usually required.

shar files are also sometimes called &quot;sharchives&quot; (from &quot;/bin/sh archive&quot;).

Note that the shar command is not specified by the Single Unix Specification, so it is not formally a component of Unix, but a legacy utility.

==Details==
While the shar format has the advantage of being plain text, it poses a risk due to being executable; for this reason the older and more general tar file format is usually preferred even for transferring text files. GNU provides its own version of shar in the GNU Sharutils collection.

&quot;unshar&quot; programs have been written for other operating systems but are not always reliable; shar files are shell scripts and can theoretically do anything that a shell script can do (including using incompatible features of enhanced or workalike shells), limiting their utility outside the Unix world.

The drawback of self-extracting shell scripts (any kind, not just shar) is that they may rely on a particular implementation of programs; shell archives created with older versions of &quot;makeself&quot;, for example, the original &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; for Linux installer, fails to run on bash 3.x due to a change in how missing arguments to codice_2 built-in command are handled.

==History and variants==
James Gosling is credited with writing the first version of the &quot;shar&quot; utility in 1982, and also wrote an early example (allegedly 1978-79) of the concept in the form of this simple shell script:
# shar -- Shell archiver
AR=$1
shift
for i do
 echo a - $i
 echo &quot;echo x - $i&quot; »$AR
 echo &quot;cat &gt;$i «&#x27;!Funky!Stuff!&#x27;&quot; »$AR
 cat $i »$AR
 echo &quot;!Funky!Stuff!&quot; »$AR
done
The following variants of &quot;shar&quot; are known:

* &quot;shar 1.x&quot; (1982) by Gosling. Public domain shell script.
** Current FreeBSD &quot;shar&quot;. 3-clause BSD license, shell script. Adds md5sum.
* &quot;shar2&quot; or &quot;xshar&quot; (1988) by William Davidsen. Public domain, C program.
** &quot;shar3&quot; (1989) by Warren Tucker.

A version of the same concept, but for the VMS operating system, was written in 1987 by Michael Bednarek from The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research as a DCL script, VMS_SHAR.COM. This was later maintained and extended by James A. Gray from Xerox, and Andy Harper from King&#x27;s College London.

&quot;makeself&quot; (2001–) is a shell script that generates self-extracting tarballs (, ) using the same shell script header technique. Using tar precludes makeself from being used in plain text directly, but the better compression and other functionalities has made it more popular in the 21st century among software vendors seeking to package Linux software.

<text>Chrysalis Records () is a British independent record label that was founded in 1968. The name is both a reference to the pupal stage of a butterfly and a combination of its founders&#x27; names, Chris Wright and Terry Ellis. It started as the Ellis-Wright Agency.

==History==
===Early years===
In an interview for Jethro Tull&#x27;s video &quot;20 Years of Jethro Tull&quot;, released in 1988, Wright states &quot;&quot;Chrysalis Records&quot; might have come into being anyway, you never know what might have happened, but &quot;Chrysalis Records&quot; really came into being because Jethro Tull couldn&#x27;t get a record deal and MGM couldn&#x27;t even get their name right on the record&quot;. This was after the single &quot;Sunshine Day/Aeroplane&quot; was incorrectly credited to &#x27;Jethro Toe&#x27;.

Chrysalis entered into a licensing deal with Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records for distribution, based on the success of bands like Jethro Tull, Ten Years After and Procol Harum, which were promoted by the label. Jethro Tull signed with Reprise Records in the United States, which led Chrysalis to an American distribution deal with Reprise&#x27;s parent company, Warner Bros. Records. This lasted from 1972 until U.S. Chrysalis switched to independent distribution in 1976. PolyGram handled international distribution and Festival Records covered Australia and New Zealand. In 1973, it signed British rock band UFO. Towards the end of the 1970s, the label began to extend its range of music, incorporating acts from the punk rock scene such as Generation X. The Chrysalis offshoot 2 Tone Records brought in bands such as The Specials and The Selecter.

In 1979, Chrysalis bought and distributed U.S. folk label Takoma Records, naming manager/producer Denny Bruce as president, who signed The Fabulous Thunderbirds and T-Bone Burnett. Jon Monday who was Vice President of Takoma Records prior to the acquisition continued as General Manager, later becoming Director of Marketing of Chrysalis Records.

Chrysalis made history in 1979 by creating the first &quot;music video album&quot;, a videocassette featuring a corresponding music video for each song on Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Eat to the Beat&quot; album (released at the same time as the LP).

In the 1980s, Chrysalis was at the forefront of the British new romantic movement with bands such as Gen X, Ultravox, and Spandau Ballet. The 1980s proved to be the most successful time for the label, whose roster then included Billy Idol, Pat Benatar, Blondie and Huey Lewis and the News. Chrysalis also distributed Animal Records, the short-lived label founded by Blondie guitarist, Chris Stein. In 1983, after the label re-established itself in New York, Eric Heckman, formally of Atlantic and Epic Records promotion took over as Senior Director of Promotion and Marketing. Also in 1983, Daniel Glass moved to Chrysalis as Director of New Music Marketing, advancing later to Senior Vice President. During the next two years Chrysalis broke Huey Lewis and the News, Billy Idol and Spandau Ballet in the United States, whilst Pat Benatar continued to find success on both the traditional and dance music charts.

In 1984, Chrysalis bought Ensign Records, a record label Nigel Grainge started in 1976 (with the label&#x27;s name coming from the idea that &#x27;N. signs&#x27; as in &#x27;Nigel Signs&#x27;). Ensign Records would go on to have The Waterboys, World Party and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor on its roster in the late 1980s. Ensign joined TV marketing/compilations company Dover Records and dance label Cooltempo as part of the Chrysalis family, with Grainge staying on to run the label that he founded.

===EMI===

50% of the Chrysalis Records label was sold in 1989, then the remaining half in 1991 to Thorn EMI, with the Chrysalis Group (primarily a music publisher with other interests in radio and television production) setting up new indie labels such as Echo and Papillon in the mid 1990s. Chrysalis Records was folded into EMI subsidiary and flagship label EMI Records in 2005, with catalogue and artists such as Starsailor being shifted to EMI&#x27;s main imprints. In 2010, BMG Rights Management bought Chrysalis Music&#x27;s assets (the publishing division and The Echo Label).

In September 2012, after acquiring EMI&#x27;s record labels, Universal Music Group offered to divest several record labels, including EMI&#x27;s Chrysalis and Parlophone, in order to meet the European Commission&#x27;s demands. The deal did not include Chrysalis&#x27; North American catalogue (which was folded into Capitol Records in 2007) or Robbie Williams (who was transferred to Island Records).

In February 2013, Warner Music Group announced that it would acquire many of EMI&#x27;s European record labels, including Chrysalis and Parlophone, for £487 million. In July 2013, WMG completed its purchase of the Parlophone Label Group.

===Later ownership===
Two weeks after announcing its acquisition of Parlophone, Warner Music agreed to sell roughly 30 percent of its own catalogue to independent record labels.

Chrysalis Records was bought in May 2016 from WMG in a deal led by Blue Raincoat Music&#x27;s Jeremy Lascelles and Robin Millar. The agreement saw the co-founder and original owner of Chrysalis, Chris Wright, reunited with the label as non-executive chairman, 27 years after selling the company to EMI. Former Virgin Media boss Robert Devereux was also part of the original consortium.

After the 2016 purchase, Warner Music kept the rights to namely Spandau Ballet, The Proclaimers, Jethro Tull and the Ramones, whilst Universal Music kept the rights to Chrysalis&#x27; American, Canadian and some British artists.

Chrysalis Records has represented over 20,000 recordings comprising many British and other, chiefly American, rock and pop tracks from the 1960s to 1990s. Artists on the roster include The Specials, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, The Waterboys, Ten Years After, Debbie Harry, Fun Boy Three, Ultravox, Lucinda Williams, Dario G, Generation X, the Two Tone label, Grant Lee Buffalo, Everything but the Girl, Athlete, Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals, Suzi Quatro, Steve Harley, Naked Eyes and many more.

In 2018, the Cooltempo label was relaunched by Blue Raincoat Music with the release of the &quot;Eye Ring EP&quot; by Francesca Lombardo and Infinity Ink&#x27;s debut album &quot;House of Infinity&quot;. In August 2019, music rights company, Reservoir, partnered with Blue Raincoat, to make the Chrysalis record label part of Reservoir&#x27;s extended global infrastructure and network.

===2020s===
Chrysalis Records relaunched itself as a front line label in February 2020, marking a return to releasing new music for the first time in over two decades. The first signing was in partnership with award winning independent label Partisan Records. The labels came together to sign British singer/songwriter Laura Marling in a fully co-branded global release. As the first project released on Chrysalis&#x27; re-launched frontline label, Marling&#x27;s album, &quot;Song for Our Daughter&quot;, debuted in April 2020 to critical acclaim and a Mercury Prize nomination.

In September 2020, Chrysalis signed the indie singer-songwriter Liz Phair. Her raw lyrical style made her a trailblazer for a raft of female artists in alternative music, when she began to make records at the start of the 1990s. Phair&#x27;s first album in a decade, &quot;Soberish&quot;, came out later in 2021.

On 6 August 2021, the second album from Laura Marling and Mike Lindsay&#x27;s project, Lump (styled in all caps), titled &quot;Animal&quot; charted at number 65 on the UK Albums Chart, and was one of the Top 20 selling albums for that week (6–12 August 2021). Chrysalis also reissued the first six albums by De La Soul on physical, digital and streaming platforms in early 2023; those albums were originally released by Tommy Boy, which, like Chrysalis, is also owned by Reservoir Media.

In July 2023, &quot;The Endless Coloured Ways&quot; was released under the Chrysalis Records label. It is a collection of songs by singer/songwriter Nick Drake, performed and recorded by 30 artists, including Fontaines D.C., Guy Garvey, Aurora, Feist, Self Esteem and David Gray.

<text>The STEN (or Sten gun) is a British submachine gun chambered in 9×19mm which was used extensively by British and Commonwealth forces throughout World War II and during the Korean War. The Sten paired a simple design with a low production cost, facilitating mass production to meet the demand for submachine guns. 

As well as equipping regular units, the Sten was distributed to resistance groups within occupied Europe. Its simple design made it an effective insurgency weapon for resistance groups. 

The Sten is a select fire, blowback-operated weapon with a side-mounted magazine. Sten is an acronym, derived from the names of the weapon&#x27;s chief designers: Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold J. Turpin, and &quot;En&quot; for the Enfield factory.
Around four million Stens in various versions were made in the 1940s, making it the second most produced submachine gun of the Second World War, after the Soviet PPSh-41. The Sten served as the basis for the Sterling submachine gun, which replaced the Sten in British service from the 1950s.

==History==
The Sten emerged while Britain was engaged in the Battle of Britain, facing invasion by Germany. The army was forced to replace weapons lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk while expanding their arsenal at the same time. After the start of the war and to 1941 (and even later), the British purchased all the Thompson submachine guns they could from the United States, but these did not meet demand, and Thompsons were expensive, the M1928 costing $200 in 1939 (and still $70 in 1942), whereas a Sten would turn out to cost only $11. American entry into the war at the end of 1941 placed an even bigger demand on the facilities making Thompsons. In order to rapidly equip a sufficient fighting force to counter the Axis threat, the Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield, was commissioned to produce an alternative.

The credited designers were Major R. V. Shepherd, OBE, Inspector of Armaments in the Ministry of Supply Design Department at The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, (later Assistant Chief Superintendent at the Armaments Design Department) and Harold John Turpin, Senior Draughtsman of the Design Department of the Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF), Enfield. Shepherd had been recalled to service after having retired and spending some time at the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA).

The Sten shared design features, such as its side-mounted magazine configuration, with the Lanchester submachine gun being produced at the same time for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, which was a copy of the German MP28. In terms of manufacture, the Lanchester was entirely different, being made of high-quality materials with pre-war fit and finish, in stark contrast to the Sten&#x27;s austere execution. The Lanchester and Sten magazines were even interchangeable (though the Lanchester&#x27;s magazine was longer with a 50-round capacity, compared to the Sten&#x27;s 32.)

The Sten used simple stamped metal components and minor welding, which required minimal machining and manufacturing. Much of the production could be performed by small workshops, with the firearms assembled at the Enfield site. Over the period of manufacture, the Sten design was further simplified: the most basic model, the Mark III, could be produced from five man-hours of work. Some of the cheapest versions were made from only 47 different parts (out of 47 components, only the barrel and bolt were machined). The Mark I was a more finely finished weapon with a wooden foregrip and handle; later versions were generally more spartan, although the final version, the Mark V, which was produced after the threat of invasion had died down, was produced to a higher standard.

The Sten underwent various design improvements over the course of the war. For example, the Mark 4 cocking handle and corresponding hole drilled in the receiver were created to lock the bolt in the closed position to reduce the likelihood of unintentional discharges inherent in the design. Most changes to the production process were more subtle, designed to give greater ease of manufacture and increased reliability, and the potentially great differences in build quality contributed to the Sten&#x27;s reputation as being an unreliable weapon. Historian John Warwicker claimed &quot;Exaggerated reports about the unreliability [of the Sten] were usually related to the quality of manufacture. Don Handscombe and his comrades in the Thundersley Patrol of the Auxiliary Units rated them more reliable than the Thompson SMG.&quot; Sten guns of late 1942 and beyond were highly effective weapons, though complaints of accidental discharge continued throughout the war.

The Sten was replaced by the Sterling submachine gun from 1953 and was gradually withdrawn from British service in the 1960s. Other Commonwealth nations followed suit, either by creating their own replacements or adopting foreign designs.

==Design==
The Sten was a blowback-operated submachine gun firing from an open bolt with a fixed firing pin on the face of the bolt. This means the bolt remains to the rear when the weapon is cocked and on pulling the trigger the bolt moves forward from spring pressure, stripping the round from the magazine, chambering it and firing the weapon all in the same movement. There is no breech locking mechanism; the rearward movement of the bolt caused by the recoil impulse is arrested only by the mainspring and the bolt&#x27;s inertia. 

The German MP40, Russian PPSh-41, and US M3 submachine gun, among others, used the same operating mechanisms and design philosophy of the Sten, namely their low cost and ease of manufacture. Though the MP40 was also built largely for this purpose, Otto Skorzeny went on record saying that he preferred the Sten because it required less raw material to produce and performed better under adverse combat conditions. The effect of putting lightweight automatic weaponry into the hands of soldiers greatly increased the short-range firepower of the infantry, especially when the main infantry weapon was a bolt-action rifle capable of only around 15 rounds per minute. The open-bolt firing mechanism, short barrel and use of pistol ammunition severely restricted accuracy and stopping power, with an effective range of only around , compared to for the Lee–Enfield rifle.

Stoppages could occur for poor maintenance, while others were particular to the Sten. Carbon build up on the face of the breech or debris in the bolt raceway could cause a failure to fire, while a dirty chamber could cause a failure to feed. Firing the Sten by grasping the magazine with the supporting hand, contrary to instruction, tended to wear the magazine catch, altering the angle of feed and causing a failure to feed; the correct method of holding the weapon was as with a rifle, the left hand cradling the fore piece.
The Sten&#x27;s magazine, which, like the Lanchesters, derived from the MP28, originally to use its magazines, which incorporated the faults of the MP28 magazine. The magazine had two columns of 9mm cartridges in a staggered arrangement, merging at the top to form a column. While other staggered magazines, such as the Thompson, fed from the left and right side alternately (known as &quot;double column, double feed&quot;), the Sten magazine required the cartridges gradually to merge at the top of the magazine to form a column (&quot;double column, single feed&quot;). Dirt or foreign matter in this taper area could cause feed malfunctions. The walls of the magazine lip had to endure the full stresses of the rounds being pushed in by the spring. This, along with rough handling could result in deformation of the magazine lips (which required a precise 8° feed angle to operate), resulting in misfeeding and a failure to fire. If a Sten failed to feed due to jammed cartridges in the magazine, standard practice to clear it was to remove magazine from the gun, tap the base of the magazine against the knee, re-insert the magazine, then re-cock the weapon and fire again as normal. To facilitate easier loading when attempting to push the cartridges down to insert the next one, a magazine filler tool was developed and formed part of the weapon&#x27;s kit. The slot on the side of the body where the cocking knob ran was also a target of criticism, as the long opening could allow foreign objects to enter. On the other hand, a beneficial side-effect of the Sten&#x27;s minimalist design was that it would fire without any lubrication.

The selector was a push button type that actuated a sear disconnector to enable firing in semi-automatic. When firing in this mode, the bolt moves rearward tripping on the sear disconnector downwards requiring the user to release the trigger to fire the weapon again. When firing in full automatic, the selector slightly pivots and moves the sear disconnector sideways enabling the trigger to hold the sear in the firing position without interference of the bolt movement. The open bolt design combined with cheap manufacture and rudimentary safety devices also meant the weapon was prone to accidental discharges, which proved hazardous. A simple safety could be engaged while the bolt was in the rearwards (cocked) position. However, if a loaded Sten with the bolt in the closed position was dropped, or the butt was knocked against the ground, the bolt could move far enough rearward to pick up a round (but not far enough to be engaged by the trigger mechanism) and the spring pressure could be enough to chamber and fire the round. The Mk. IV&#x27;s cocking handle was designed to prevent this by enabling the bolt to be locked in its forward position, immobilising it. Wear and manufacturing tolerances could render these safety devices ineffective. Though the Sten was somewhat prone to malfunction, in the hands of a well-trained soldier, who knew how to avoid the Sten&#x27;s failings, they were less of a liability as otherwise may be suggested. According to Leroy Thompson, &quot;Troops usually made the conscious choice to keep the Sten with a magazine in place, based on the assumption that they might need it quickly. It might, then, be argued that more troops were saved by having their Sten ready when an enemy was suddenly encountered than were injured by accident. The Sten was more dangerous to its users than most infantry weapons, but all weapons are dangerous&quot;.

== Variants ==

Sten guns were produced in several basic marks, of which nearly half of the total produced consisted of the Mark II variant. Approximately 4.5 million Stens were produced during the Second World War.

=== Mark I ===

The first ever Mk I Sten gun (number &#x27;T-40/1&#x27; indicating its originator Harold Turpin, the year 1940 and the serial number &quot;1&quot;) was handmade by Turpin at the Philco Radio works at Perivale, Middlesex during December 1940/January 1941 in 36 days. This weapon is held by the historical weapons collection of the British Army&#x27;s Infantry and Small Arms School Corps in Warminster, Wiltshire.

The Mark I had a conical flash hider and fine finish. The bolt on the Mark I rotated downwards to hold open for safety, similar to that of a bolt action rifle (The bolt on Mark II+ variants rotate upwards). The handguard, vertical forward grip and some of the stock were made of wood. The stock consisted of a small tube, similar to the Mark II Canadian. The barrel shroud had vent holes. The magazine insert was fixed to the receiver with screws (unlike the later found on Mark II+ variants that could be rotated 90 degrees for stowage). A design choice that was only present on the Mark I was that the vertical forward grip could be rotated forward to make it easier to stow. 100,000 Mark I Stens were made before production was moved to the Mark II. Mark I Stens in German possession were designated MP 748(e), the &#x27;e&#x27; standing for &quot;englisch&quot;.

=== Mark I* ===

The Mark I* (pronounced &quot;Mark-One-Star&quot;) variant was to simplify production of the Mark I, the handguard, vertical foreward grip, vent holes, wooden furniture and conical flash hider were removed with this variant. It was the first variant to come with a tube stock.

=== Mark II ===

The Mark II was the most common mainstream variant, with two million units produced. The flash eliminator and the folding handle (the grip) of the Mk I were omitted. A removable barrel was now provided which projected beyond the barrel sleeve. It used a tube stock. Also, a special catch allowed the magazine to be slid partly out of the magazine housing and the housing rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (from the operator&#x27;s perspective), together covering the ejection opening and allowing the weapon and magazine both to lie flat on its side.

The barrel sleeve was shorter and rather than having small holes on the top, it had three sets of three holes equally spaced on the shroud. To allow a soldier to hold a Sten by the hot barrel sleeve with the supporting hand, an insulating lace-on leather sleeve guard was sometimes issued. Sten Mk II&#x27;s in German possession were designated MP 749(e). Some Mk IIs had wooden stocks. The Spz-kr assault rifle, a rudimentary German design made in the closing stages of the war, used the receiver and components from the Sten Mk II, and the MP 3008 was made as a cheap copy.

===Mark II (Canadian)===
 During World War II, a variation of the Sten gun was produced at the Long Branch Arsenal plant in Long Branch, Ontario (now Lakeview, an area of Mississauga, Peel Region). This was very similar to the regular Mark II, with a different stock (&#x27;skeleton&#x27; type instead of strut type). It was first used in combat in the Dieppe Raid in 1942.

The Mark II that were made in China with a copy known as the M38. The Chinese M38s were made in an automatic-only configuration, unlike the standard Mark II. The M38 was made in 9×19mm and 7.62×25mm Tokarev variants.

===Mark III===

After the Mark II, this was the most produced variant of the Sten, manufactured in Canada alongside the United Kingdom, with Lines Bros Ltd being the largest producer. The Mark III was made of 48 parts, compared to the Mark II&#x27;s 69, but the Mark II remained more commonplace for logistical reasons – parts between the two were not interchangeable. Though slightly lighter, the magazine well was fixed in place, and the barrel could not be removed, meaning if it was damaged the weapon had to be scrapped. Combined with the fact the Mark III was more prone to failure than the Mark II, production of the weapon ceased in September 1943. Unlike the Mark II, the receiver, ejection port, and barrel shroud were unified, leading to them being extended further up the barrel. Captured Sten Mk III&#x27;s in German possession were designated MP 750(e). A total of 876,886 Mark III&#x27;s were produced.

===Mark V===

The Mark V added a bayonet mount, and a wooden pistol grip and stock. There was a No. 4 Lee–Enfield Front sight and the weapon was of better quality manufacture and finish than the Mk II and Mk III.

Another variant of the Mk V had a swivel stock and rear sight mirror intended for firing around corners in urban warfare, similar to the Krummlauf developed by the Germans for the StG 44.

===Suppressed models===
Mk II(S) and Mk VI models incorporated an integral suppressor and had a lower muzzle velocity than the others due to a ported barrel intended to reduce velocity to below the speed of sound – – without needing special ammunition. The suppressor heated up rapidly when the weapon was fired, and a canvas cover was laced around the suppressor for protection for the firer&#x27;s supporting hand.

; Mk II(S): Designed in 1943, the Mk II(S) (&quot;Special-Purpose&quot;) was an integrally suppressed version of the Mk II. Captured examples of the Sten Mk II(S) in German service were designated MP 751(e).
; Mk VI: The Mk VI was a suppressed version of the Mk V. The Mk VI was the heaviest version due to the added weight of the suppressor, as well as using a wooden pistol grip and stock.

The suppressed models were produced at the request of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) for use in clandestine operations in occupied Europe, starting with the Mk II(S) in 1943. Owing to their tendency to overheat, they were fired in short bursts or single shots. Some guns were even changed to semi-automatic only.

In addition to its use in the European theatre, the Mk II(S) saw service with clandestine units in the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA) such as the Services Reconnaissance Department and SOE&#x27;s Force 136 on operations against the Imperial Japanese Army. The Sten Mk II(S) was used by the Operation Jaywick party during their raid into Japanese-occupied Singapore Harbour.

The Sten Mk II(S) also saw service with the Special Air Service Regiment during the Vietnam War.

=== Experimental models ===

; Mark II (wooden stock model): This was a standard Sten Mk.II with a wooden stock attached in place of the wireframe steel stock used with Mk.IIs. This wooden stock model was never put into service; likely due to the cost of producing it.
; Mark II (Rosciszewski model): This was a Sten Mk.II modified by Antoni Rosciszewski of Small Arms Ltd. The magazine was mechanically operated by the breech block movement. The trigger was split into two sections, with the upper part of the trigger offering full-auto fire and a lower part offering single shots. It was very complex in design and never fielded.
; Mark II (pistol grip model): This was a Sten Mk.II with a wireframe pistol grip, intended for use with paratroopers. It was compact but predictably uncomfortable to fire.
; Model T42: This was a Sten Mk.II modified with a five-inch barrel and folding stock, as well as a conventional pistol grip and redesigned trigger guard. It was dubbed the &quot;T42&quot; in prototype phases, but never entered service.
; Mark IV: The Mark IV was a smaller variant of the Sten, comparable in size to a pistol, and never left the prototype stage. It used a conical flash hider, a shortened barrel, and a much lighter stock.
; Rofsten: Developed at the Royal Ordnance Factory in Fazakerley (ROF Fazakerley), the Rofsten was an odd Sten prototype with a redesigned magazine feed, ergonomic pistol grip, selector switch and cocking system. The weapon was cocked by pulling the small ring above the stock. A large flash eliminator was fixed onto the barrel, and a No.5 bayonet could be fixed. It was made to a very high quality standard and had an increased rate of fire (around 900 rounds per minute). The Rofsten was made in 1944 as a single prototype and ROF wanted to submit it to trials the next year. Despite better quality there were numerous reliability problems due to the much higher rate of fire. The budget cuts prevented the modifications and this version never got beyond the prototype stage.
; Small Arms Ltd. Model 2: Designed by Antoni Rosciszewski of Small Arms Ltd, this weapon used a magazine with an internal endless belt-feed holding 50 rounds of ammunition. The weapon also had a two-stage trigger for automatic and semi-automatic fire.
; Viper mk1: This version simplified the weapon, including the trigger mechanism and barrel which was welded to the gun making it not removable. The weapon was also fully automatic and there was no semi-automatic function on the gun. It was made in the United Kingdom after World War II and was a prototype weapon never used as it was deemed impractical. It was designed for military policeman in post-war Germany to be fired one-handed. Only one was ever made and it is currently held at the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds, United Kingdom.

=== Foreign-built variants and post-1945 derivatives ===

; Argentina: Sten MkIIs were licence-copied in Argentina by Pistola Hispano Argentino and can be recognised with a wooden handguard in front of the trigger group. It was known as the Modelo C.4. Another variant came with a pistol grip section based on the Ballester–Molina .45 pistol. The Halcon ML-57 was a simpler derivative of the Sten gun of Argentine origin that was fed from a vertically inserted magazine.

; Indonesia: Indigenous copies were produced at the former Demakijo (alternatively Demak Ijo) sugar mill in Sleman Regency and other factories throughout Yogyakarta in 1946–1948 for the Indonesian Army during the Indonesian National Revolution. The indigenous Sten had the trigger group closer to the magazine insert. Another variant of the indigenous copies was named &quot;Pren Gun&quot;, from the portmanteau of Pranggono (the designer) and Sten gun. Pren Gun were made at a factory in Tirtomoyo, Wonogiri Regency for the Surakarta-based &quot;Tentara Genie Pelajar&quot; (Student Soldiers Combat Engineers). The design were similar to Sten Mk II with wire stock and additional flash hider.
; Israel: Copies of the Sten Mk II and Sten Mk V were clandestinely manufactured in Tel Aviv and on various kibbutzim in 1945–48 for use with Haganah and other Jewish paramilitary groups.
; France: The French &quot;Gnome et Rhône&quot; R5 Sten, manufactured in Limoges by the motorbike and aeroplane engine manufacturer Gnome et Rhône (SNECMA), came with a shorter barrel, a forward pistol grip and distinctive wooden stock, although its greatest improvement was a sliding bolt safety, added to secure the bolt in its forward position. Dimensions have been converted to the metric system, so the parts were not interchangeable with the Sten. From an initial target of 10,000 to 20,000 copies, 8,100 R5s were produced between late 1944 and November 1945. They were delivered to the former FFI units of the French Liberation Army and some were used during the Western Allied invasion of Germany and the First Indochina War.&lt;br&gt;Another variant made by MAC (Manufacture d’armes de Châtellerault), were made and tested shortly after WWII. One variant had an unusual stock shape that proved detrimental to the user aim. Internally it was basically a Sten gun but had two triggers for semi/full auto, a grip safety and a foregrip that used MP40 magazines. Another had a folding stock with a folding magazine insert. The trigger mechanism was complicated and unusual. Neither of these prototypes had any kind of success and MAC closed its doors not long after their conception.
; Norway: The Norwegian resistance, under the leadership of Bror With, created a large number of Sten guns from scratch, mainly to equip members of the underground army &quot;Milorg&quot;. In his autobiography, Norwegian resistance fighter Max Manus frequently mentions the Sten as one of the weapons his groups of commandos and resistance fighters used effectively against German troops.
; Denmark: Several groups in the Danish resistance movement manufactured Sten guns for their own use. BOPA produced around 200 in a bicycle repair shop on Gammel Køge landevej (Old Køge road), south of Copenhagen. Holger Danske produced about 150 in workshops in Copenhagen, while employees of the construction company Monberg &amp; Thorsen built approximately 200–300 in what is now the municipality of Gladsaxe (a suburb of Copenhagen) for use by Holger Danske and others. The resistance groups &#x27;Frit Danmark&#x27; and &#x27;Ringen&#x27; also built significant numbers of Stens.

; Poland: From 1942 and 1944, approximately 11,000 Sten Mk IIs were delivered to the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; by the SOE and Cichociemni. Because of the simplicity of the design, local production of Sten variants was started in at least 23 underground workshops in Poland, with some producing copies of the Mark II, and others developing their own designs, namely the &quot;&quot;, the &quot;KIS&quot;, and the more significantly altered &quot;Błyskawica&quot;. Polski Stens made in Warsaw under the command of Ryszard Białostocki were built from parts made in official factories, with the main body of the design being made from hydraulic cylinders produced for hospital equipment. To help disguise their origin, the Polski Stens were marked in English.

; Belgium: A little known version of the MkII Sten was built in Belgium by &quot;l&#x27;arsenale militare belga&quot; (the Belgian military arsenal). The magazine well was stamped AsArm (the manufacturer), ABL (for Armée Belge Belgisch Leger), the Belgian Royal Crown and a serial number of typically five figure with no letter prefix. It is believed the Belgian built Mk II Stens remained in ABL service until the early 1980s, particularly with helicopter-borne forces. Some of the weapons had a &quot;Parkerised&quot; finish. After the Second World War the Belgian Army was mainly equipped with a mixture of British and American submachine guns. The army, wanting to replace them with a modern and preferably native design, tested various designs with the Vigneron M2 and licence-produced FN Uzi being selected. However, the Imperia was an improved Sten with a fire selector and retractable stock.
; Germany: In late 1944, Mauser began to produce copies of the Mk II Sten for sabotage purposes. The series was referred to as the &quot;Gerät Potsdam&quot; (Potsdam Device) and almost 10,000 weapons were made. By 1945, Germany was seeking a cheaper replacement for the MP40 submachine gun to issue to the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;. Mauser produced a modified Sten, named the MP 3008. The main difference was that the magazine attached below the weapon. Altogether, roughly 10,000 were produced in early 1945, just before the end of World War II.
; Australia: The Mark I Austen submachine gun (&quot;Australian Sten&quot;) was an Australian design, derived from the Sten and manufactured by Diecasters Ltd of Melbourne and W. T. Carmichael Ltd of Sydney. It externally resembled the Sten but had twin pistol grips and folding stock resembling those of the German MP40. Australian and NZ troops however preferred the Owen gun which was more reliable and robust in jungle warfare. A Mk 2 version was also produced which was of different appearance and which made more use of die-cast components. 20,000 Austens were made during the war and the Austen was replaced by the F1 submachine gun in the 1960s.
; United States: A short-lived American invention developed in the 1980s, the Sputter Gun was designed to circumvent the law that defined a machine gun as something that fired multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. The Sputter Gun had no trigger, but fired continuously after loading and the pulling back of its bolt, firing until it ran out of ammunition. The gun was very short lived as the ATF quickly reclassified it. During the 1970s-1980s, International Ordnance of San Antonio, Texas, United States released the machine pistol. It was intended as a more compact, simpler derivative of the British Sten gun to be used in urban guerrilla actions, to be manufactured cheaply and/or in less-than-well-equipped workshops and distributed to &quot;friendly&quot; undercover forces. Much like the FP-45 Liberator pistol of World War II, it could be discarded during an escape with no substantial loss for the force&#x27;s arsenal. The MP2 is a blowback-operated weapon that fires from an open bolt with an extremely high rate of fire.
; Guatemala: The is a machine pistol of Guatemalan origin and manufactured by Cellini-Dunn IMG, Military Research Corp and Wildfire Munitions as the SM-90. It is blowback operated, firing from an open bolt and can use magazines from Ingram MAC-10 submachine guns inserted into a similar foregrip that can be rotated 45 and 90 degrees for left/right handed operators. The layout of the receiver is somewhat simpler than that of a Sten with its internal components light in weight enabling a very high rate of fire of 1200rpm. Its forward pistol grip can hold a spare magazine as well as handling the weapon when firing.
; Croatia: The Pleter submachine gun was created in 1991 when the breakup of Yugoslavia in the midst of emerging war left the newly formed Republic of Croatia with small number of military firearms. Since the embargo prevented the Croatian military from legally buying them on open market (so they were mostly obtained on the world black market, but with significantly higher price and sometimes of questionable quality), to fulfill the immediate need for arms, they tried to resort on quick and simple locally made designs. Despite having a vertical magazine well (designed to accept 32-round staggered-feed direct copy of UZI magazine, rather than original single-feed Sten-type magazine), analogies with the Sten include a striking resemblance in the barrel assembly and in the bolt and recoil spring. In addition, this gun also fires from an open bolt, and is further simplified by removing fire mode selector or any safety.
; Canada: SMG International in Canada manufactured reproductions of the Sten in six variants. They made copies of the Sten&#x27;s Mk 1*, Mk II and Mk III, a &quot;New Zealand Sten&quot; (a Mk II/III Sten hybrid, with sights and a fixed magazine housing similar to the Mk III), then branched out into &quot;hypothetical&quot; Sten-guns with a &quot;Rotary Magazine Sten&quot; (a Mk II Sten with a drum magazine attached below the weapon and wooden horizontal forward grip on the left side of the weapon) and the &quot;FRT Gun&quot; (a long barrel Sten with a wooden or Mk 1* type butt stock, a drum magazine attached below the weapon and sliding ramp rear sights). These last two being obviously not Sten reproductions, especially if they included a drum magazine. The &quot;Rotary Magazine Sten&quot; is a vertically fed Sten which uses a modified Sten bolt, which can use either PPSh drum magazines or stick magazines. The FRT gun is essentially a Suomi that uses a Sten trigger mechanism. All SaskSten guns fire from an open bolt.
;Taiwan: During the 1950s in the 39th year of the Republic of China, the 44th Arsenal developed a prototype Sten with a folding Dadao blade known as the Type 90. This example used a rear pistol grip and an inline tube stock with folding blade catch and extended barrel shroud.

===Conversions===
The Sten MKII can be converted to take 7.62×25mm ammo by changing the barrel, magazine, magazine housing and bolt. Some of them were imported to the US before 1968. These MKIIs were made by Long Branch as part of a Nationalist Chinese contract.

While all types of 7.62×25mm ammo can be used, those made in the former Czechoslovakia are made for small arms that can handle high velocity, so users are not advised to use them.

==Service==
The Sten, especially the Mark II, tended to attract affection and loathing in equal measure. Its peculiar appearance when compared to other firearms of the era, combined with sometimes questionable reliability made it unpopular with some front-line troops. It gained nicknames such as &quot;Plumber&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, &quot;Plumber&#x27;s Abortion&quot;, or &quot;Stench Gun&quot;. The Sten&#x27;s advantage was its ease of mass-production manufacture in a time of shortage during a major conflict.

Made by a variety of manufacturers, often with subcontracted parts, some early Sten guns were made poorly and/or not to specification, and could malfunction in operation, sometimes in combat. The double-column, single-feed magazine copied from the German MP28 was never completely satisfactory, and hasty manufacturing processes often exacerbated the misfeed problems inherent in the design. A common statement heard from British forces at the time was that the Sten was made &quot;by Marks and Spencer out of Woolworth.&quot; British and Commonwealth forces in the early years of the war often extensively test-fired their weapons in training to weed out bad examples; a last-minute issue of newly manufactured Stens prior to going into action was not welcomed.

The MK II and III Stens were regarded by many soldiers as very temperamental, and could accidentally discharge if dropped or even laid on the ground whilst the gun was cocked. Others would fire full-automatic when placed on &#x27;single&#x27;, or fire single shots when placed on &#x27;automatic&#x27;. This was particularly true of early Stens using bronze bolts, where the sear projection underneath the bolt could wear down more easily than ones made of case-hardened steel.

Stens could jam at inopportune moments. One of the more notable instances of this was the assassination of SS–Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich on 27 May 1942, when Czechoslovak Warrant Officer Jozef Gabčík wanted to fire his Sten point blank at Heydrich, only to have it misfire. His comrade Jan Kubiš then hastily tossed a grenade, which mortally wounded Heydrich. There are other accounts of the Sten&#x27;s unreliability, some of them true, some exaggerated and some apocryphal. France manufactured (well-made) Sten copies postwar into the early 1950s, evidently believing in the basic reliability and durability of the design.
A well-maintained (and properly functioning) Sten gun was a devastating close-range weapon for sections previously armed only with bolt-action rifles. In addition to regular British and Commonwealth military service, Stens were air-dropped in quantity to resistance fighters and partisans throughout occupied Europe. Due to their slim profile and ease of disassembly/reassembly, they were good for concealment and guerrilla warfare. Wrapping the barrel in wet rags would delay undesirable overheating of the barrel. Guerrilla fighters in Europe became adept at repairing, modifying and eventually scratch-building clones of the Sten (over 2,000 Stens and about 500 of the similar Błyskawica SMGs were manufactured in occupied Poland).
Canadian infantry battalions in northwest Europe retained spare Sten guns for special missions and the Canadian Army reported a surplus of the weapons in 1944.
The Sten saw use even after the economic crunch of World War II, replacing the Royal Navy&#x27;s Lanchester submachine guns into the 1960s, and was used in the Korean War, including specialist versions for British Commandos. It was slowly withdrawn from British Army service in the 1960s and replaced by the Sterling SMG; Canada also phased out the Sten, replacing it with the C1 SMG.

The Sten was one of the few weapons that the State of Israel could produce domestically during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Even before the declaration of the State of Israel, the Yishuv had been producing Stens for the Haganah; after the declaration, Israel continued making Stens for IDF use. The opposing side also used (mostly British-made) Stens, particularly the irregular and semi-regular Arab Liberation Army.

In the 1950s, &quot;L numbering&quot; came into use in the British Army for weapons—Stens were then known as L50 (Mk II), L51 (Mk III) and L52 (Mk V).

One of the last times the Sten was used in combat during British service was with the RUC during the IRA border campaign of 1956–1962. In foreign service, the Sten was used in combat at least as recently as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.

Sten guns were widely used by guerrilla fighters during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. In 1975, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members were assassinated using Sten guns. 

A number of suppressed Stens were in limited use by the US Special Forces during the Vietnam War, including c. 1971, by the United States Army Rangers.

In 1984, Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her bodyguards, one of whom fired the entire magazine (30 rounds) of his Sten at point-blank range, of which 27 hit her.

In the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, both nationalists and communist Chinese forces used the Sten. Some Stens were converted by the communists to 7.62×25mm by using the magazine housing from a PPS to accept curved PPS magazines. British, Canadian, and Chinese Stens were seen in the hands of the communists during the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

The Finnish Army acquired moderate numbers of Stens in the late 1950s, mainly Mk. III versions. Refurbishment at the Kuopio Arsenal included bluing of the arms. Stens in Finnish service saw limited usage by conscripts (notably combat swimmers) and were mostly stockpiled for use in a future mobilization.

During the Zapatista movement in 1994, some Zapatista soldiers were armed with Sten guns.

<text>In physics and materials science, plasticity (also known as plastic deformation) is the ability of a solid material to undergo permanent deformation, a non-reversible change of shape in response to applied forces. For example, a solid piece of metal being bent or pounded into a new shape displays plasticity as permanent changes occur within the material itself. In engineering, the transition from elastic behavior to plastic behavior is known as yielding.

Plastic deformation is observed in most materials, particularly metals, soils, rocks, concrete, and foams. However, the physical mechanisms that cause plastic deformation can vary widely. At a crystalline scale, plasticity in metals is usually a consequence of dislocations. Such defects are relatively rare in most crystalline materials, but are numerous in some and part of their crystal structure; in such cases, plastic crystallinity can result. In brittle materials such as rock, concrete and bone, plasticity is caused predominantly by slip at microcracks. In cellular materials such as liquid foams or biological tissues, plasticity is mainly a consequence of bubble or cell rearrangements, notably T1 processes.

For many ductile metals, tensile loading applied to a sample will cause it to behave in an elastic manner. Each increment of load is accompanied by a proportional increment in extension. When the load is removed, the piece returns to its original size. However, once the load exceeds a threshold – the yield strength – the extension increases more rapidly than in the elastic region; now when the load is removed, some degree of extension will remain.

Elastic deformation, however, is an approximation and its quality depends on the time frame considered and loading speed. If, as indicated in the graph opposite, the deformation includes elastic deformation, it is also often referred to as &quot;elasto-plastic deformation&quot; or &quot;elastic-plastic deformation&quot;.

Perfect plasticity is a property of materials to undergo irreversible deformation without any increase in stresses or loads. Plastic materials that have been hardened by prior deformation, such as cold forming, may need increasingly higher stresses to deform further. Generally, plastic deformation is also dependent on the deformation speed, i.e. higher stresses usually have to be applied to increase the rate of deformation. Such materials are said to deform visco-plastically.

==Contributing properties==
The plasticity of a material is directly proportional to the ductility and malleability of the material.

== Physical mechanisms ==
=== In metals ===
Plasticity in a crystal of pure metal is primarily caused by two modes of deformation in the crystal lattice: slip and twinning. Slip is a shear deformation which moves the atoms through many interatomic distances relative to their initial positions. Twinning is the plastic deformation which takes place along two planes due to a set of forces applied to a given metal piece.

Most metals show more plasticity when hot than when cold. Lead shows sufficient plasticity at room temperature, while cast iron does not possess sufficient plasticity for any forging operation even when hot. This property is of importance in forming, shaping and extruding operations on metals. Most metals are rendered plastic by heating and hence shaped hot.

====Slip systems====
Crystalline materials contain uniform planes of atoms organized with long-range order. Planes may slip past each other along their close-packed directions, as is shown on the slip systems page. The result is a permanent change of shape within the crystal and plastic deformation. The presence of dislocations increases the likelihood of planes.

====Reversible plasticity====
On the nanoscale the primary plastic deformation in simple face-centered cubic metals is reversible, as long as there is no material transport in form of cross-slip. Shape-memory alloys such as Nitinol wire also exhibit a reversible form of plasticity which is more properly called pseudoelasticity.

====Shear banding====
The presence of other defects within a crystal may entangle dislocations or otherwise prevent them from gliding. When this happens, plasticity is localized to particular regions in the material. For crystals, these regions of localized plasticity are called shear bands.

====Microplasticity====
Microplasticity is a local phenomenon in metals. It occurs for stress values where the metal is globally in the elastic domain while some local areas are in the plastic domain.

=== Amorphous materials ===
====Crazing====
In amorphous materials, the discussion of &quot;dislocations&quot; is inapplicable, since the entire material lacks long range order. These materials can still undergo plastic deformation. Since amorphous materials, like polymers, are not well-ordered, they contain a large amount of free volume, or wasted space. Pulling these materials in tension opens up these regions and can give materials a hazy appearance. This haziness is the result of &quot;crazing&quot;, where fibrils are formed within the material in regions of high hydrostatic stress. The material may go from an ordered appearance to a &quot;crazy&quot; pattern of strain and stretch marks.

=== Cellular materials ===
These materials plastically deform when the bending moment exceeds the fully plastic moment. This applies to open cell foams where the bending moment is exerted on the cell walls. The foams can be made of any material with a plastic yield point which includes rigid polymers and metals. This method of modeling the foam as beams is only valid if the ratio of the density of the foam to the density of the matter is less than 0.3. This is because beams yield axially instead of bending. In closed cell foams, the yield strength is increased if the material is under tension because of the membrane that spans the face of the cells.

=== Soils and sand ===

Soils, particularly clays, display a significant amount of inelasticity under load. The causes of plasticity in soils can be quite complex and are strongly dependent on the microstructure, chemical composition, and water content. Plastic behavior in soils is caused primarily by the rearrangement of clusters of adjacent grains.

=== Rocks and concrete ===

Inelastic deformations of rocks and concrete are primarily caused by the formation of microcracks and sliding motions relative to these cracks. At high temperatures and pressures, plastic behavior can also be affected by the motion of dislocations in individual grains in the microstructure.

== Time-independent yielding and plastic flow in crystalline materials ==
Time-independent plastic flow in both single crystals and polycrystals is defined by a critical/maximum resolved shear stress (&quot;τ&quot;CRSS), initiating dislocation migration along parallel slip planes of a single slip system, thereby defining the transition from elastic to plastic deformation behavior in crystalline materials.

=== Time-independent yielding and plastic flow in single crystals === 
The critical resolved shear stress for single crystals is defined by Schmid’s law &quot;τ&quot;CRSS=σy/m, where σy is the yield strength of the single crystal and &quot;m&quot; is the Schmid factor. The Schmid factor comprises two variables λ and φ, defining the angle between the slip plane direction and the tensile force applied, and the angle between the slip plane normal and the tensile force applied, respectively. Notably, because &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1, &quot;σ&quot;&quot;y&quot; &gt; &quot;τ&quot;CRSS.

==== Critical resolved shear stress dependence on temperature, strain rate, and point defects ====
There are three characteristic regions of the critical resolved shear stress as a function of temperature. In the low temperature region 1 (&quot;T&quot; ≤ 0.25&quot;T&quot;m), the strain rate must be high to achieve high &quot;τ&quot;CRSS which is required to initiate dislocation glide and equivalently plastic flow. In region 1, the critical resolved shear stress has two components: athermal (&quot;τ&quot;&quot;a&quot;) and thermal (&quot;τ&quot;*) shear stresses, arising from the stress required to move dislocations in the presence of other dislocations, and the resistance of point defect obstacles to dislocation migration, respectively. At &quot;T&quot; = &quot;T&quot;*, the moderate temperature region 2 (0.25&quot;T&quot;m &lt; &quot;T&quot; &lt; 0.7&quot;T&quot;m) is defined, where the thermal shear stress component &quot;τ&quot;* → 0, representing the elimination of point defect impedance to dislocation migration. Thus the temperature-independent critical resolved shear stress τCRSS = τa remains so until region 3 is defined. Notably, in region 2 moderate temperature time-dependent plastic deformation (creep) mechanisms such as solute-drag should be considered. Furthermore, in the high temperature region 3 (&quot;T&quot; ≥ 0.7&quot;T&quot;m) έ can be low, contributing to low τCRSS, however plastic flow will still occur due to thermally activated high temperature time-dependent plastic deformation mechanisms such as Nabarro–Herring (NH) and Coble diffusional flow through the lattice and along the single crystal surfaces, respectively, as well as dislocation climb-glide creep.

==== Stages of time-independent plastic flow, post yielding ====
During the easy glide stage 1, the work hardening rate, defined by the change in shear stress with respect to shear strain (&quot;dτ&quot;/&quot;dγ&quot;) is low, representative of a small amount of applied shear stress necessary to induce a large amount of shear strain. Facile dislocation glide and corresponding flow is attributed to dislocation migration along parallel slip planes only (i.e. one slip system). Moderate impedance to dislocation migration along parallel slip planes is exhibited according to the weak stress field interactions between these dislocations, which heightens with smaller interplanar spacing. Overall, these migrating dislocations within a single slip system act as weak obstacles to flow, and a modest rise in stress is observed in comparison to the yield stress. During the linear hardening stage 2 of flow, the work hardening rate becomes high as considerable stress is required to overcome the stress field interactions of dislocations migrating on non-parallel slip planes (i.e. multiple slip systems), acting as strong obstacles to flow. Much stress is required to drive continual dislocation migration for small strains. The shear flow stress is directly proportional to the square root of the dislocation density (τflow ~&quot;ρ&quot;½), irrespective of the evolution of dislocation configurations, displaying the reliance of hardening on the number of dislocations present. Regarding this evolution of dislocation configurations, at small strains the dislocation arrangement is a random 3D array of intersecting lines. Moderate strains correspond to cellular dislocation structures of heterogeneous dislocation distribution with large dislocation density at the cell boundaries, and small dislocation density within the cell interior. At even larger strains the cellular dislocation structure reduces in size until a minimum size is achieved. Finally, the work hardening rate becomes low again in the exhaustion/saturation of hardening stage 3 of plastic flow, as small shear stresses produce large shear strains. Notably, instances when multiple slip systems are oriented favorably with respect to the applied stress, the τCRSS for these systems may be similar and yielding may occur according to dislocation migration along multiple slip systems with non-parallel slip planes, displaying a stage 1 work-hardening rate typically characteristic of stage 2. Lastly, distinction between time-independent plastic deformation in body-centered cubic transition metals and face centered cubic metals is summarized below.
=== Time-independent yielding and plastic flow in polycrystals ===
Plasticity in polycrystals differs substantially from that in single crystals due to the presence of grain boundary (GB) planar defects, which act as very strong obstacles to plastic flow by impeding dislocation migration along the entire length of the activated slip plane(s). Hence, dislocations cannot pass from one grain to another across the grain boundary. The following sections explore specific GB requirements for extensive plastic deformation of polycrystals prior to fracture, as well as the influence of microscopic yielding within individual crystallites on macroscopic yielding of the polycrystal. The critical resolved shear stress for polycrystals is defined by Schmid’s law as well (τCRSS=σy/ṁ), where σy is the yield strength of the polycrystal and &quot;ṁ&quot; is the weighted Schmid factor. The weighted Schmid factor reflects the least favorably oriented slip system among the most favorably oriented slip systems of the grains constituting the GB. 

==== Grain boundary constraint in polycrystals ====
The GB constraint for polycrystals can be explained by considering a grain boundary in the xz plane between two single crystals A and B of identical composition, structure, and slip systems, but misoriented with respect to each other. To ensure that voids do not form between individually deforming grains, the GB constraint for the bicrystal is as follows:
εxxA = εxxB (the x-axial strain at the GB must be equivalent for A and B), εzzA = εzzB (the z-axial strain at the GB must be equivalent for A and B), and εxzA = εxzB (the xz shear strain along the xz-GB plane must be equivalent for A and B). In addition, this GB constraint requires that five independent slip systems be activated per crystallite constituting the GB. Notably, because independent slip systems are defined as slip planes on which dislocation migrations cannot be reproduced by any combination of dislocation migrations along other slip system’s planes, the number of geometrical slip systems for a given crystal system - which by definition can be constructed by slip system combinations - is typically greater than that of independent slip systems. Significantly, there is a maximum of five independent slip systems for each of the seven crystal systems, however, not all seven crystal systems acquire this upper limit. In fact, even within a given crystal system, the composition and Bravais lattice diversifies the number of independent slip systems (see the table below). In cases for which crystallites of a polycrystal do not obtain five independent slip systems, the GB condition cannot be met, and thus the time-independent deformation of individual crystallites results in cracks and voids at the GBs of the polycrystal, and soon fracture is realized. Hence, for a given composition and structure, a single crystal with less than five independent slip systems is stronger (exhibiting a greater extent of plasticity) than its polycrystalline form.
==== Implications of the grain boundary constraint in polycrystals ====
Although the two crystallites A and B discussed in the above section have identical slip systems, they are misoriented with respect to each other, and therefore misoriented with respect to the applied force. Thus, microscopic yielding within a crystallite interior may occur according to the rules governing single crystal time-independent yielding. Eventually, the activated slip planes within the grain interiors will permit dislocation migration to the GB where many dislocations then pile up as geometrically necessary dislocations. This pile up corresponds to strain gradients across individual grains as the dislocation density near the GB is greater than that in the grain interior, imposing a stress on the adjacent grain in contact. When considering the AB bicrystal as a whole, the most favorably oriented slip system in A will not be the that in B, and hence τACRSS ≠ τBCRSS. Paramount is the fact that macroscopic yielding of the bicrystal is prolonged until the higher value of τCRSS between grains A and B is achieved, according to the GB constraint. Thus, for a given composition and structure, a polycrystal with five independent slip systems is stronger (greater extent of plasticity) than its single crystalline form. Correspondingly, the work hardening rate will be higher for the polycrystal than the single crystal, as more stress is required in the polycrystal to produce strains. Importantly, just as with single crystal flow stress, τflow ~ρ½, but is also inversely proportional to the square root of average grain diameter (τflow ~d-½ ). Therefore, the flow stress of a polycrystal, and hence the polycrystal’s strength, increases with small grain size. The reason for this is that smaller grains have a relatively smaller number of slip planes to be activated, corresponding to a fewer number of dislocations migrating to the GBs, and therefore less stress induced on adjacent grains due to dislocation pile up. In addition, for a given volume of polycrystal, smaller grains present more strong obstacle grain boundaries. These two factors provide an understanding as to why the onset of macroscopic flow in fine-grained polycrystals occurs at larger applied stresses than in coarse-grained polycrystals.

== Mathematical descriptions ==
=== Deformation theory ===
There are several mathematical descriptions of plasticity. One is deformation theory (see e.g. Hooke&#x27;s law) where the Cauchy stress tensor (of order d-1 in d dimensions) is a function of the strain tensor. Although this description is accurate when a small part of matter is subjected to increasing loading (such as strain loading), this theory cannot account for irreversibility.

Ductile materials can sustain large plastic deformations without fracture. However, even ductile metals will fracture when the strain becomes large enough—this is as a result of work hardening of the material, which causes it to become brittle. Heat treatment such as annealing can restore the ductility of a worked piece, so that shaping can continue.

=== Flow plasticity theory ===

In 1934, Egon Orowan, Michael Polanyi and Geoffrey Ingram Taylor, roughly simultaneously, realized that the plastic deformation of ductile materials could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations. The mathematical theory of plasticity, flow plasticity theory, uses a set of non-linear, non-integrable equations to describe the set of changes on strain and stress with respect to a previous state and a small increase of deformation.

== Yield criteria ==

If the stress exceeds a critical value, as was mentioned above, the material will undergo plastic, or irreversible, deformation. This critical stress can be tensile or compressive. The Tresca and the von Mises criteria are commonly used to determine whether a material has yielded. However, these criteria have proved inadequate for a large range of materials and several other yield criteria are also in widespread use.

===Tresca criterion===
The Tresca criterion is based on the notion that when a material fails, it does so in shear, which is a relatively good assumption when considering metals. Given the principal stress state, we can use Mohr&#x27;s circle to solve for the maximum shear stresses our material will experience and conclude that the material will fail if

: formula_1

where &quot;σ&quot;1 is the maximum normal stress, &quot;σ&quot;3 is the minimum normal stress, and &quot;σ&quot;0 is the stress under which the material fails in uniaxial loading. A yield surface may be constructed, which provides a visual representation of this concept. Inside of the yield surface, deformation is elastic. On the surface, deformation is plastic. It is impossible for a material to have stress states outside its yield surface.

===Huber–von Mises criterion===

The Huber–von Mises criterion is based on the Tresca criterion but takes into account the assumption that hydrostatic stresses do not contribute to material failure. M. T. Huber was the first who proposed the criterion of shear energy. Von Mises solves for an effective stress under uniaxial loading, subtracting out hydrostatic stresses, and states that all effective stresses greater than that which causes material failure in uniaxial loading will result in plastic deformation.

: formula_2

Again, a visual representation of the yield surface may be constructed using the above equation, which takes the shape of an ellipse. Inside the surface, materials undergo elastic deformation. Reaching the surface means the material undergoes plastic deformations.

<doc id="240126" wikidata="Q932962" url="?curid=240126" title=".hack//Sign">
<text>.hack//Sign (stylized as .hack//SIGN) is a Japanese anime television series directed by Kōichi Mashimo, and produced by studio Bee Train and Bandai Visual, that makes up one of the four original storylines for the &quot;.hack&quot; franchise. Twenty-six original episodes aired in 2002 on television and three additional bonus ones were released on DVD as original video animation. The series features each characters designed by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, and written by Kazunori Itō. The score was composed by Yuki Kajiura, marking her second collaboration with Mashimo.

The series is influenced by psychological and sociological subjects, such as anxiety, escapism and interpersonal relationships. The series focuses on a Wavemaster (magic user) named Tsukasa, a player character in a virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game called &quot;The World&quot;. He wakes up to find himself in a dungeon in &quot;The World&quot;, but he suffers from short-term memory loss as he wonders where he is and how he got there. The situation gets worse when he discovers he is trapped in the game and cannot log out. From then on, along with other players, Tsukasa embarks on a quest to find the truth behind his abnormal situation.

The series premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo from April 4 to September 25, 2002. It was broadcast across East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and Latin America, by the anime television network, Animax, and across the United States, Nigeria, Canada and United Kingdom, by Cartoon Network, YTV and AnimeCentral (English and Japanese) respectively. It was distributed across North America by Bandai.

The storyline moves at a leisurely pace, and has multiple layers—the viewer is often fed false information and red herrings, potentially leading to confusion until the true nature of events is unveiled towards the end of the series. It relies on character development and has few action scenes; most of the time character interaction is presented in the form of dialogue. English language reception to the series has been generally positive, but some of these sources have negatively criticised the series as a result of its slow pacing and character-driven storyline.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
The series is set in a fictional 2009, introducing a computer virus called &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Kiss&quot; as the cause of a massive Internet shutdown. The results are described as catastrophic: traffic lights shut down, planes collide in midair, and the American nuclear missiles are nearly launched. As a consequence, cyberspace is subjected to severe restrictions. The virus affects all operating systems except for one, Altimit OS, the only operating system immune to all computer viruses.

Two years later free access to the networks recovers, bringing with it the release of &quot;The World&quot;: the first online game since &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Kiss&quot;, developed for Altimit OS. &quot;The World&quot; is portrayed as a fantasy setting wherein player characters can be different classes, adventure by themselves to go searching through dungeons or join with others and form parties, fight monsters and level up, collect new items and participate in special events. At the center of each server is a Root Town, which contain shops, a save point, and the Chaos Gate that players use to travel between servers in the game.

Harald Hoerwick is introduced as the creator of &quot;The World&quot;. He secretly designed the game as a virtual womb in order to create the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), by receiving emotional and psychological data from the players. His motivation is revealed to be the death of Emma Wielant, a German poet with whom he was in love; the AI, who was named Aura, would serve as the &quot;daughter&quot; they never had. Harald left the gathering of the required data for Aura&#x27;s development at the care of the core system of &quot;The World&quot; itself, an omnipresent AI called Morganna Mode Gone. The storyline of &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;, set in early 2010, revolves around the premise of Morganna attempting to stall the growth of Aura indefinitely, after realizing that she will lose her purpose once Aura is complete.

===Plot===

The series follows the story about Tsukasa being mind-trapped into the game. Despite being a &quot;fantasy quest type adventure&quot;, it does not rely on action sequences. Instead, the show is driven by mystery, slowly revealing its secrets to the viewer while paying much attention to the individual characters. Questions like what happened to Tsukasa in the real world, who he really is, and why he cannot log out are driving points of the story.

Soon after the beginning of the series, Tsukasa is led to a hidden area. There he meets Morganna, depicted as a voice without physical appearance, and Aura, who appears as a young girl clad entirely in white, floating asleep above a bed. The storyline introduces Morganna as an ally, but her real intentions are unknown at this point.

As the story progresses many characters are introduced, some who want to help, some who have ulterior motives. Then more questions arise as to &quot;what is happening in the game itself, who are these various characters, what are their true goals and what will happen to Tsukasa&quot;. All the while he is seen struggling with his increasingly dire situation as well as his own social and emotional shortcomings. Tsukasa isolates himself, but eventually he begins to get closer to other players, and builds strong relationships with some of them; the most important is the one born between him and Subaru, a kind and thoughtful female Heavy Axeman.

In the meantime, the series follows the quest for the , a legendary item rumored to have the ability to bypass the system in &quot;The World&quot;. Some characters want the &quot;Key&quot; to gain the power this supposedly confers. Others believe the item will provide Tsukasa with a way to log out. Despite their reasons for seeking it, everyone agrees that it is related to Tsukasa in some way, as he is also a factor bypassing the system in the game. His body being in a coma in the real world adds a sense of urgency to the quest.

Near the end of the series, Tsukasa&#x27;s real-life identity takes a more central place in the storyline, particularly in relation to his growing bond with Subaru. The series shows his fear and insecurity as he confesses to her that he is probably a girl in the real world. It is also at this point when Tsukasa is told Morganna&#x27;s plan by a highly skilled hacker called Helba. Morganna conceived the plan to link Aura to a character who could corrupt her with negative emotional data, placing her in a state where she would never awaken. The chosen character was Tsukasa, as his mind was filled with distressful memories of his real life. Helba also suggests that when Aura is able to awaken, &quot;the &quot;Key of the Twilight&quot; will take form&quot;.

The story reaches the climax, when Tsukasa confronts Morganna. He declares that he is no longer afraid of her or of reality, and will log out because there is someone he wants to see. This statement triggers Aura&#x27;s awakening, allowing Tsukasa to log out. The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa&#x27;s real-life self, who is shown to actually be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.

===Characters===
The primary characters in the series are Tsukasa, BT, Bear, Mimiru and Subaru (as depicted in the intro of the series).

Tsukasa is the protagonist of the story and plays a Wavemaster. At the start of the series he is seen waking up to find himself trapped in &quot;The World&quot;, unable to log out. He is initially depicted as a cynical introvert who tends to avoid others as much as possible, but his character development shows him growing to realize there are people who care about him. One of these people is Subaru, a female Heavy Axeman introduced as the leader of the Crimson Knights, a player organization designed to fight injustice (such as player killing) in &quot;The World&quot;. Most of the time Subaru is the only character preventing the Crimson Knights from running wild; she knows that they must be restrained from abusing their power. She eventually joins in the search of a way to help Tsukasa, and builds a close relationship with him.

Also close to Tsukasa is Mimiru, a Heavy Blade who is poor at planning things out and following through on them. She is the first player to meet Tsukasa, and later forms a bond with him and vows to protect him. She usually hangs out with Bear, trying to solve the mystery of Tsukasa&#x27;s inability to log out. Bear is an older player of the game and plays a Blademaster. He appears as cool and collected, always willing to help out newbies. He also conducts research in the real world on Tsukasa. One of Bear&#x27;s acquaintances is BT, a plotting and scheming Wavemaster.

BT teams up with Crim and Sora to find the &quot;Key of the Twilight&quot;. Crim is a powerful Long Arm, friend of Subaru who founded the Crimson Knights organization with her, but afterwards left it as he found it did not match his personality. Amiable, easygoing and sociable; he prefers to keep the real world and the game separate. Crim&#x27;s stated goal when playing is simply to have fun, although he never turns down a chance to help somebody in need. Sora is a Twin Blade player killer who enjoys hunting players down, especially attractive female ones, and demanding their Member Addresses in exchange for their lives. He sees Tsukasa as the strongest link to the &quot;Key of the Twilight&quot;, and starts working with BT in the quest for it.

==Concept and design==
The project development began in early 2000 as a joint effort between Bandai and CyberConnect2, with the original idea of producing an online game. In online games people can interact with each other and create their own stories. The producers wanted to design a game that would offer the players the same experience, but they later thought it would be more appealing with its own storyline, like in standard offline role-playing video game. According to Daisuke Uchiyama, sub-leader of Bandai&#x27;s video game planning department, the result was a challenge to the RPG genre itself: an offline RPG, entitled &quot;.hack&quot;, set in a simulated MMORPG named &quot;The World&quot;.

For &quot;The World&quot;&#x27;s design, writer Kazunori Ito did an extensive research on online games available at the time: the staff played titles such as &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, and &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. Nevertheless, according to Hiroshi Matsuyama (president of CyberConnect2), they were not actively looking to make the fictional game seem like a real-life one. Instead, the idea was to create a &quot;gigantic game system that, if the CC Corporation (the creators of &quot;The World&quot; in the game) actually existed, it would make sense for them to be behind&quot; [emphasis added]; a game described by Matsuyama as largely &quot;futuristic and alien&quot;.

As the project started shortly before the PlayStation 2&#x27;s release, the authors seized the opportunity to make the &quot;.hack&quot; game on the new platform. This decision allowed them to develop into unexpected directions. Shin Unozawa, general manager of Bandai&#x27;s game department, suggested dividing the game into four parts and release them in three-month intervals. The idea being to follow the four panel manga style as well as to keep sales constant throughout the year. Taking advantage of the PlayStation 2&#x27;s capability to read DVD-Video, the authors also decided making an OVA series (&quot;.hack//Liminality&quot;) comprised by four episodes, one to go with each game. Nevertheless, they still felt the need to bolster the project with something more, therefore they decided to produce &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;, a TV show timed to air with the first game&#x27;s release. For Kōichi Mashimo it was a hectic schedule: he was directing both animated projects, and was also in the midst of developing the &quot;Noir&quot; anime series.

===Imagery===

The virtual environment depicted in &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; draws on medieval imagery: settings range from a Venice-like city to a Gothic stone church, passing by settlements such as villages and castles; the series&#x27; scenery shows examples of Celtic art. Natural landscapes such as forests and tundras complete the setting design, which overall displays the fantasy theme seen in most MMORPGs.

Sadamoto&#x27;s character designs follow the fantasy theme as well, drawing influence from the sword and sorcery subgenre in particular. Character designs also draw on Celtic imagery: Director Mashimo acknowledged similarities between Bear&#x27;s design and Mel Gibson in his role as William Wallace, an example of Celtic warrior. All the characters are given distinctive patterns resembling tattoos, the visual representation of a fictional gameplay aspect called Wave.

In contrast with &quot;The World&quot;&#x27;s scenery, real-world sequences are minimalist in their presentation. They display faces frequently obscured by shadows or hidden by extreme angles. The dialogue is not heard, but shown through title cards: when someone speaks the screen blacks out and a line of red or blue text appears with the dialogue. The combination of visual and acoustic noise makes reality appear as &quot;some kind of less authentic, alternate channel&quot;.

===Music===
Yuki Kajiura provides a soundtrack permeated by the Celtic style and gaming theme of the series. The songs feature synthesizer and strings compositions, as well as vocals consisting of English chanting. Celtic influence is prominent in themes such as &quot;Key of the Twilight&quot; and &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;. Performed by Emily Bindiger, &quot;Key of the Twilight&quot; blends a pulsing drum and bass mix with guitar intonations. &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, on the other hand, combines Bindiger&#x27;s contralto vocals with an uilleann pipes solo. The &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; soundtrack also features vocals by Yuriko Kaida. &quot;Mimiru&quot; has her humming across a saxophone melody performed by Kazuo Takeda; in &quot;Das Wandern&quot; she sings over a lone piano.

European influence is prominent in instrumental pieces as well, &quot;Foreigners&quot; being a prime example. Reminiscent of a classic Irish diddy, the track comprises a flute dancing across a tribal-like percussion set. Orchestral music includes pieces such as &quot;Fear&quot; and &quot;Kiss&quot;. &quot;Fear&quot; features an electronic melody wrapped around a digital-beat groove, mixed with a distant voice uttering &quot;feeaarr!&quot;. Combining &quot;the childlike humanity into a frightening digital reality&quot;, the song is an &quot;analogy to the series&#x27; plot&quot;. &quot;Kiss&quot; is a theme that entirely features traditional symphony, although only using a few performers. It is a violin and piano mix, used to set mood in the series.

The opening theme of the series is &quot;Obsession&quot;. Performed by Kajiura&#x27;s musical group See-Saw, the track features an electric guitar and rapid electronic beat. The closing theme is , also performed by See-Saw. It is a blend of Japanese vocals, an Irish bouzouki, acoustic guitars and percussion. Both themes were released as a single on May 22, 2002, by Victor Entertainment. Three original soundtracks with vocals Emily Bindiger, with music and arrangement (and lyrics in vocals themes) by Yuki Kajiura were released. The first original soundtrack was released in North America with the limited edition of the first &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; DVD. This album is a mix of vocal themes and BGM. Most of the vocal songs and a couple of BGM tracks have strong Celtic influence. The BGM is completed with tracks with noticeable console-RPG style. The second original soundtrack was released in North America with the limited edition of the second &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; DVD. All of the tracks are fairly slow, with catchy beats. The final music soundtrack was titled &quot;.hack//Extra Soundtrack&quot;. In North America this soundtrack was included with the limited edition of the fourth &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; DVD.

===Themes===
Despite its visual concept, &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; is not a sword and sorcery story, but an exposition-driven character study. It proposes &quot;a trip inside the psychology and soul of an emotionally bruised, but slowly healing person.&quot; Themes range from psychological to sociological and are dealt with using classical dialogue as well as image-only introspection.

Among the most prominent themes in &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; are anxiety, its causes, and the effects it has upon human behavior. Scenes of the real world show people living an apprehensive, even painful reality: characters&#x27; background includes subjects such as dysfunctional families and physical impediments. Tsukasa himself is psychologically affected by years of physical abuse and neglect, a state that gets worse throughout his experience in the game, where his reality disappears and he begins to doubt his own existence. When anxiety is excessive (like in the case depicted by Tsukasa&#x27;s story) and can not be relieved by practical problem-solving methods, &quot;the human ego uses maneuvers such as a defense mechanism to deny, falsify or even distort reality.&quot; The anime series explores this process as the root of emotional and behavioral issues such as detachment and isolation.

Escapism, if only as representing a consequence of anxiety, is a significant theme in &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;. The series explores how technology, such as the Internet and online games, can be used to escape reality. &quot;The World&quot; is portrayed as a means that people use &quot;to escape their lives&quot;, assuming roles online that compensate for their shortcomings in the real world: to some, it is a place where they can overcome their physical limitations; to others, it is a social outlet or a world free of rules. In addition, the preference given to the virtual world over reality represents the intrusion of technology in the social structure: as people engage in &quot;the wide potential of cyberspace&quot;, they become more withdrawn in the real world.

Interpersonal relationships are a prominent theme too. The show explores the psychological effects social connections have upon people with emotional needs. Initially Tsukasa shows no respect for any values or other people, but as he engages in relationships, he begins to gradually change, learning to care about others and acquiring the strength to face the reality of his life.

===Releases===

Originally, &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; was broadcast in Japan on TV Tokyo between April 4 to September 25, 2002. The same year Victor Entertainment released the entire score in three albums, along with a single containing the opening and ending of the series.

In North America, &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; was licensed and distributed by Bandai Entertainment, and dubbed by PCB Productions, who are known for their adaptations of fare like &quot;Geneshaft&quot;. The dub aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami between February 1, 2003 and March 1, 2004. The series was also released on DVD, spanning six volumes. The limited edition ran from March 4, 2003 to March 16, 2004, followed by the regular edition from March 18, 2003 to March 16, 2004. A recap episode called &quot;Evidence&quot; and the DVD only episode &quot;Intermezzo&quot; were included in the sixth volume, and &quot;Unison&quot; was only included in its limited edition. Following the multimedia concept of the franchise, Bandai also acquired the license for the &quot;.hack&quot; games, the first one being released the same month the anime series began broadcast.

The multimedia approach is shown through the DVD release as well. The limited edition not only included the three soundtrack albums of the series, but also the soundtrack of &quot;.hack//Liminality&quot; and a demo disc of the first game.

The series was compiled three times. The first DVD box set was released on October 26, 2004, by the name &quot;.hack//Sign – Complete Collection&quot;, and the second, more affordable one on August 22, 2006, by the name &quot;.hack//Sign: Anime Legends Complete Collection&quot;. Neither of these releases contains the OVA episode &quot;Unison&quot;.

Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment, Funimation (later Crunchyroll, LLC) announced at SDCC 2013, that they acquired four .hack titles including SIGN. In 2015, Funimation released the DVD boxset &quot;.hack//Sign: The Complete Series&quot;, which contains all 28 episodes, including both OVA episodes.

===Publications===
A compilation artbook called &quot;.hack//the visions&quot; was included in the February, 2003 issue of &quot;Newtype&quot; published by Kadokawa Shoten. The book contains &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;, &quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight&quot;, and the &quot;.hack&quot; games illustrations which were originally shown in different issues of Newtype during 2002. Participating artists included Rei Izumi, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Satoshi Ohsawa, and Yuko Iwaoka.

An information book about &quot;Project .hack.&quot; was published by Fujimi Shobo in June, 2003. The book, called &quot;Encyclopedia .hack&quot; (), is a compilation of theories and information about storyline, setting, and characters of the franchise, taken from the series itself. Another information book about &quot;Project .hack&quot; was published by Softbank Publishing on September 27, 2003. This publication was called &quot;hack//analysis&quot; () and, unlike &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, included never-before-seen information on &quot;The World&quot; and the characters of the franchise. Information about &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; characters like Bear and BT was expanded in this book.

==Reception==
The series has generally been positive. Holly Ellinwood of Anime Active saluted Ito&#x27;s &quot;well thought out, even provocative&quot; storyline in the 2006 review of the series, saying that it is &quot;far more cerebral, even existential than the anime&#x27;s other less sophisticated contemporaries.&quot; Nevertheless, reviewers agree that it is the series which viewers either love or hate. According to Mike Toole from Anime Jump, it &quot;deserves to be both maligned and admired&quot;. NeedCoffee&#x27;s reviewer regarded the show as &quot;one of the most controversial titles in recent years&quot;. Negative criticism focuses on the slow-paced story and the almost total absence of action sequences, elements which are also considered as what makes the series &quot;most unique&quot;.

Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network called the series &quot;interesting to watch,&quot; saying the story gets more &quot;detailed and complex&quot; by the show&#x27;s fourth episode, praised the music selection, the voice casting, and the artwork. Dong also said that while the storyline has &quot;aspects of mediocrity, &quot; the storyline is intriguing and intense, and that the series is something that &quot;has to be watched at least once.&quot; 
Nick Creamer of Anime News Network called the series the &quot;grandfather of MMO anime,&quot; saying it is mellow, contemplative, and slow. He further said that the show puts you in the middle of relationships between the character and although these are not originally described, views come to understand the logic behind their actions, and added that the &quot;underlying art&quot; of the series holds up. He also said that the series has consistent backgrounds, a diverse music score, and calls the anime, ultimately, a story of &quot;anxiety and identity and virtual selves.&quot;

The series received high marks for technical aspects. Chris Beveridge from Anime On DVD feels the animation is &quot;gorgeous&quot; and the &quot;colors are lush and vivid&quot;. Tasha Robinson from SCI FI Weekly says that &quot;&quot;The World&quot;&#x27;s hugely varied settings provide ever-changing backgrounds,&quot; which are considered by Rob Lineberger of DVD Verdict as &quot;detailed and innovative&quot;. In his review of the first English release, Mike Toole described the series as &quot;a beautiful, rich-looking series, with frequently sumptuous character design and animation that&#x27;s only emphasized by the quality of the DVD.&quot; A negative opinion is expressed by Rob Lineberger himself, who says that &quot;many of the animated sequences were static characters with slightly moving lips.&quot; Tasha Robinson, instead, shows a more neutral perspective on this subject, saying that &quot;the animation is simple but attractive.&quot; A concern several reviewers express is that the gaming environment the series tries to simulate should be more crowded, being a game supposedly extremely popular worldwide. A different opinion is that of Anime Academy&#x27;s reviewer, who writes that the anime&#x27;s depiction of the game-world setting is realistic and accurate.

Bandai&#x27;s release earned praise for the quality of the video transfer and the DVD extras (particularly in the limited edition). Reviewers appreciated the English voice acting: Lauren Synger from DVD Vision Japan feels that &quot;everyone was very appropriate to their characters&quot;, noting that Brianne Sidal did an excellent work capturing Saiga&#x27;s Tsukasa. Lineberger, in contrast, finds the English dub to be &quot;antiseptic and uninspired&quot;. Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network thinks for her part that Mimiru sounded bland and poorly executed, but overall, the actors did a good job &quot;delivering their lines and giving life to their characters.&quot;

Ridwan Khan of Animefringe welcomes the &quot;excellent&quot; &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; score composed by Yuki Kajiura, which is hailed by Mark McPherson from Anime Boredom as &quot;the best orchestrated track ever made for a television series&quot;. Most reviewers agree that the soundtrack is one of the series&#x27; most prominent features. A negative criticism on the music is that it tends to overwhelm the dialogue in the first couple of episodes. Kōichi Mashimo has stated that he specifically had the music louder than the dialogue as he tried to do some experimentation, and it was his intent to draw complaints from the audience. Still, Chris Beveridge thinks it is an &quot;interesting device to sort of ratchet up the speed of things.&quot;

<text>A grey market or dark market (sometimes confused with the similar term &quot;parallel market&quot;) is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels that are not authorised by the original manufacturer or trademark proprietor. Grey market products (grey goods) are products traded outside the authorised manufacturer&#x27;s channel.

== Etymology ==
Manufacturers of computers, telecom, and technology equipment often sell these products through distributors. Most distribution agreements require the distributor to resell the products strictly to end users. However, some distributors choose to resell products to other resellers. In the late 1980s, manufacturers labelled the resold products as the &quot;grey market&quot;.

==Description==
Grey market goods are goods sold outside the authorized distribution channels by entities which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods. This form of parallel import frequently occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another. This commonly takes place with electronic equipment such as cameras. Entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, and import it to the target market. They then sell it at a price high enough to provide a profit but below the normal market price.

International efforts to promote free trade, including reduced tariffs and harmonised national standards, facilitate this form of arbitrage whenever manufacturers attempt to preserve highly disparate pricing. Because of the nature of grey markets, it is difficult or impossible to track the precise numbers of grey market sales. Grey market goods are often new, but some grey market goods are used goods. A market in used goods is sometimes nicknamed a green market.

The two main types of grey markets are those of imported manufactured goods that would normally be unavailable or more expensive in a certain country and unissued securities that are not yet traded in official markets. Sometimes the term dark market is used to describe secretive, unregulated trading in commodity futures, notably crude oil in 2008. This can be considered a third type of &quot;grey market&quot; not intended or explicitly authorised by oil producers.

The import of legally restricted or prohibited items such as prescription drugs or firearms, on the other hand, is considered black market, as is the smuggling of goods into a target country to avoid import duties. A related concept is bootlegging; the smuggling or transport of highly regulated goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The term &quot;bootlegging&quot; is also often applied to the production or distribution of counterfeit or otherwise infringing goods (also black market).

Grey markets sometimes develop for video game consoles and titles whose demand temporarily exceeds their supply causing authorised local suppliers to run out of stock. This happens especially during the Christmas and holiday season. Other popular items, such as dolls, magnets and contraception, can also be affected. In such situations, the grey market price may be considerably higher than the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price, with unscrupulous sellers buying items in bulk for the express purpose of inflating the prices during resale, a practice called scalping. Online auction sites such as eBay have contributed to the emergence of the video-game grey market.

== Goods ==

===Arcade games===
Certain otherwise identical arcade games are marketed under different titles, such as &quot;Carrier Air Wing&quot;/&quot;U.S. Navy&quot;, &quot;Mega Man&quot;/&quot;Rockman&quot;, and &quot;Police 911&quot;/&quot;Police 24/7&quot;.
When certain arcade games are first powered on, a warning message is shown such as &quot;[t]his game is intended only for sale and use in (country/region)&quot; and often, such a message is occasionally displayed while the machine is in an attract mode.

One reason for these regional name variants is trademark issues. A company may not own the rights to a trademark in another country, where that trademark may be owned by an entirely different entity. Because of this, a different name must be used.

These regional name variations may also be used to prevent the sale of bootleg arcade games, including those from Japanese versions.

===Automobiles===

Automobile manufacturers segment world markets by territory and price, thus creating a demand for grey import vehicles.
Although some grey imports are a bargain, some buyers have discovered that their vehicles do not meet local regulations, or that parts and services are difficult to obtain because these cars are different from the versions sold through the new car dealer network.

Many used cars come from Singapore or Japan, and are sold in other countries around the world, including the United Kingdom, Russia and New Zealand. Japan and Singapore both have strict laws against older cars. The Japanese &quot;Shaken&quot; testing regime requires progressively more expensive maintenance, involving the replacement of entire vehicle systems, that are unnecessary for safety, year on year, to devalue older cars and promote new cars on their home market that were available for low prices. This makes these well running cars seem reasonably priced, even after transport expenses. There are very few cars in Japan more than five years old.

New car arbitrage has become an issue in the US as well, especially when the US price is lower in the US than in countries like China.

Beyond cost issues, grey market cars provide consumer access to models never officially released. Before 1987, the Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz G-Class, and Lamborghini Countach, all revolutionary designs, were grey import vehicles in the United States. The grey market provided a clear signal to these manufacturers that the United States had significant demand for these cars, and their present-day US model descendants remain popular. Years later, Nissan similarly decided to sell the GT-R in North America after seeing how many people were importing older Skylines. Although Mercedes-Benz was also a beneficiary of the signals to US consumer demand that the grey market provided, their lobbying in Washington succeeded in virtually ending the US grey market in 1988.

In the UK, some Japanese domestic market models fetch a high price because of their performance, novelty or status, assisted by the fact that the Japanese drive on the left, in common with the UK, so vehicles are right hand drive. Popular types include off-road vehicles, people carriers, affordable sports cars like the Mazda MX-5 / Roadster, very high performance sports cars including the rally homologation based cars like the Subaru Impreza and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, ultra-compact kei cars, and limited edition Japanese market designer cars like the Nissan Figaro.

In Japan, due to strict and differing car classifications and emission regulations, or lack of main consumer demand, some international models or certain regional models are not sold in Japanese domestic market. Grey importers are trying to import some of these models into Japan but it is permitted due to lack of restrictions imposed on them, unlike in other countries. Among the grey-imported vehicles in Japan are pickup trucks like Toyota Tundra, Nissan Navara and Subaru BRAT, which are not officially sold in Japan.

===Broadcasting===

In television and radio broadcasting, grey markets primarily exist in relation to satellite radio and satellite television delivery. The most common form is companies reselling the equipment and services of a provider not licensed to operate in the market. For instance, a Canadian consumer who wants access to American television and radio services that are not available in Canada may approach a grey market reseller of Dish Network or DirecTV. There is also a grey market in the United States (especially from Canadian citizens with winter homes in the U.S.) for Canadian satellite services such as Bell Satellite TV or Shaw Direct.

VPN services also market access to programming restricted by broadcasting deals through spoofing an IP address within a different territory. This is commonly used to access a television series otherwise stuck on an unpopular streaming service and instead access it easier through a service such as Netflix, which may have it in their library within another territory.

In Europe, some satellite TV services are encrypted since they have only been authorised by content suppliers to broadcast films, sporting events and US entertainment programming in a certain country or countries. For example, only residents of the UK and Ireland may subscribe to Sky Digital. In other European countries with large British expatriate populations, such as Spain, Sky is widely available through the grey market. Although Sky discourages the use of its viewing cards outside the UK or Ireland, and has the technology to render them invalid, many people continue to use them.

Parallel importing of &quot;free-to-view&quot; Sky cards from the UK to Ireland is often done so that Irish Sky customers can receive Channel 5 and some of the other channels not generally available via Sky in Ireland because of trademark and other licensing issues. Conversely, Sky viewing cards from Ireland, which allow viewing of Irish terrestrial channels, are imported into the UK. Northern Ireland residents subscribing to Sky can watch RTÉ One and Two and TG4, although not TV3, which carries many of the same programmes as ITV, a lot of the programmes airing before ITV can show them.

It is also becoming increasingly common in the UK for some pubs to use satellite decoder cards from Greece, Norway, Poland or the Arab world to receive satellite TV broadcasting live English football matches from those countries. Alternatively, they may use cards which allow pirate decryption of scrambled signals. Such cards are typically much cheaper than the cards available in the UK from Sky (who charge extra fees for public showing licences). However, Sky has taken civil and criminal action against some who do this. Two recent cases involving grey cards have been referred to the European Court of Justice. The suppliers of grey cards and Karen Murphy won their cases at the European Court of Justice. The judges ruled that right holders cannot license their content on an exclusive territorial basis as it breaches EU law on competition and free movement of goods and services. However, whilst this ruling allows domestic viewers to subscribe to foreign satellite services, pubs may still need permission from rights holders such as the Premier League to broadcast content. This is because certain elements of the broadcast such as branding are copyrighted.

There followed two High Court judgements on this matter. Mr Justice Kitchin ruled that QC Leisure and other suppliers of foreign satellite systems could carry on with their businesses if they could prevent copyright elements such as branding of football matches from being shown in a public place. The Premier League could pursue prosecutions of licensees who showed branding of matches via foreign satellite systems. Karen Murphy won her case in the High Court following the ruling from the European Court of Justice. The ruling from Justice Stanley Burnton allowed Ms Murphy to shop for the cheapest foreign satellite provider. However, the ruling from Justice Kitchin prevented Ms Murphy from showing matches in her pub via foreign satellite systems because branding is subject to trade mark law. It is no longer illegal though for a customer to purchase a foreign viewing card from an EU country and use it outside the territory.

===Cannabis in the United States===

Unlike other countries that have legalized recreational cannabis, federal law in the United States still prohibits possessing, transporting, or selling cannabis, while many states have legalized it at the state level. These contradictory laws have led to an unusual situation where a person may purchase cannabis at a legal dispensary, but may face charges if they take it into another state where it has not been legalized or attempt to take it on an airplane.

===Cell phones===
The emergence of the GSM international standard for cell phones in 1990 prompted the beginning of the grey market in the cell phone industry. As global demand for mobile phones grew, so did the size of the parallel market. Today, it is estimated that over 30% of all mobile phones traded will pass through the grey market and that statistic continues to grow. It is impossible to quantify an exact figure, but sources suggest that as many as 500,000 mobile phones are bought and sold outside official distribution channels through their trading platforms every day. Many smaller countries and markets (Croatia, for example) are still prone to grey imports of mobile phones, apparently due to very limited number of mobile phone models ever to be sold in that particular country.

The driving forces behind a heavily active mobile phone grey market include currency fluctuations, customers demands, manufacturers policies, market-specific features, and price variations. It is not uncommon for grey market traders to introduce a product into a market months in advance of the official launch. This was evident with the launch of the iPhone 4, where international grey market traders bought large quantities at Apple&#x27;s retail price then shipped to countries where the product was not available, adding a substantial margin to the resale price. The launch of the iPhone 14, which removed the SIM card slot in the United States and was replaced with eSIM technology, but remains elsewhere, including Canada, also created a grey market for a version with a traditional SIM card slot.

===Computer software===

Purchasing some games from online content distribution systems, such as Valve&#x27;s Steam, simply requires entering a valid CD key to associate with an account. In 2007, after the release of &quot;The Orange Box&quot;, Valve deactivated accounts with CD keys that were purchased outside the consumer&#x27;s territory in order to maintain the integrity of region-specific licensing. This generated complaints from North American customers who had circumvented their Steam end-user licence agreement by purchasing &quot;The Orange Box&quot; through cheaper, market retailers.

Due to regional lockout, video game consoles and their games are often subjected to grey market trade and are chosen as the alternative to modding by some gamers. The reasons for this may range from the console being crippled in some markets to that of the desired game not being released for the market the potential consumer of the game is in.

PC code stripping is a process by which boxed PC product is bought in large quantities at cheap rates. Manual labor is then used to open the box, retrieve the activation code from the box and enter the code into a database. The activation code is then sold online as a download key and the physical product is discarded or sold as backup media.
===Electronics===
There is a grey market in electronics in which retailers import merchandise from regions where the prices are cheaper or where regional design differences are more favourable to consumers, and subsequently sell merchandise in regions where the manufacturer&#x27;s selling price is more expensive. Online retailers are often able to exploit pricing disparities in various countries by using grey-market imports from regions where the product is sold at lower costs and reselling them without regional buyer restrictions. Websites such as Taobao and eBay enable customers to buy products designed for foreign regions with different features or at cheaper costs, using parallel importation.

The grey market for photographic equipment and other such electronics is thriving in heavily taxed states like Singapore with dealers importing directly from lower taxed states and selling at lower prices, creating competition against local distributors recognised by the products&#x27; manufacturers. &quot;Grey sets&quot;, as colloquially called, are often comparable to products purchased from the manufacturer&#x27;s preferred retailer. Lenses or flash units of parallel imports often only differ by the warranty provided, and since the grey sets were manufactured for another state, photographic equipment manufacturers often offer local warranty, instead of international warranty, which will render grey sets ineligible for warranty claims with the manufacturer.

Because of the nature of local warranties, importers of grey sets usually offer their own warranty schemes to compensate for the manufacturers&#x27; refusal of service. Grey sets do not differ particularly from official imports. They look and function identically. In the early days of camera sales during the 1960s and 70s, when lenses had amber coating, the bargain basements for Japanese equipment were Hong Kong and Singapore, through which goods were channeled to European shop windows bypassing the often substantial levy of the official importers. World-market pricing and the Internet have largely eliminated this. Canon gives their hard-selling DSLR cameras names like &quot;Rebel&quot; in the US and &quot;EOS xx0/xx00&quot; outside it, aimed at preventing the competitively priced US-merchandise reaching Europe where sales are slower but achieve a higher profit.

===Frequent-flyer miles===
Trade or bartering of frequent-flyer miles is prohibited by nearly all major airlines, although an authorised medium exists for specific frequent flyer programs. Unauthorised exchanges of frequent flyer miles – of which several exist – are also major examples of grey markets.

===Infant formula===
Following the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, parents in China lost confidence in locally produced infant formula, creating a demand for European, Japanese and American produced formula. Import restrictions on formula from these sources has led to parents willing to pay a premium for foreign brands leading to the emergence of milk-powder runners, who buy formula at ticket price over the counter in Hong Kong, carry the tins over the border to Shenzhen before returning to Hong Kong to repeat the process. The effect of the runners led to a shortage of infant formula in Hong Kong forcing the government to impose an export restriction of two tins per person per trip. The Chinese then turned to Australia, subsequently also causing shortages there and for milk formula producers to ask retailers in the United Kingdom to restrict purchasers to two tins, as there was evidence that milk formula is being purchased for onward shipment to China.

===Pharmaceuticals===

Some prescription medications, most notably popular and branded drugs, can have very high prices in comparison to their cost of transport. In addition, pharmaceutical prices can vary significantly between countries, particularly as a result of government intervention in prices. As a consequence, the grey market for pharmaceuticals flourishes, particularly in Europe and along the US–Canada border where Canadians often pay significantly lower prices for US-made pharmaceuticals than Americans do.

A related concept is off-label use. Drugs are generally authorized for particular uses, but such authorization generally only prohibits the manufacturer from marketing them for other uses; physicians may be permitted to prescribe them for unauthorized, &quot;off-label&quot; uses.

===Securities===
Public company securities that are not listed, traded or quoted on any U.S. stock exchange or the OTC markets are sometimes purchased or sold over the counter (OTC) via the grey market. Grey market securities have no market makers quoting the stock. Since grey market securities are not traded or quoted on an exchange or interdealer quotation system, investor&#x27;s bids and offers are not collected in a central spot so market transparency is diminished and effective execution of orders is difficult.

In India, unofficial grey market trades are very common for the initial public offering (IPOs). The people put their money in the unregulated and unofficial grey market before the listing of the IPOs. Company promoters along with the market operators buy and sell the shares before the listing. This is the easiest way to manipulate the share price before IPO listing.

===Textbooks===
College-level textbooks have a grey market, with publishers offering them for lower prices in developing countries or sometimes the UK.

These books typically contain a disclaimer stating that importation is not permitted. However, the U.S. Supreme Court decisions &quot;Quality King v. L&#x27;anza&quot; (1998) and especially &quot;Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&quot; (2013, involving textbooks imported from Thailand by an eBay seller) protect the importation of lawfully produced copyrighted materials under the first-sale doctrine.

===Swiss watches===
The &quot;Financial Times&quot; stated that in 2022 there was market of over a billion dollars for grey market Swiss watches such as Rolex, Breitling, IWC, Cartier, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, Breguet and Bulgari.

&quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; has said that in 2017 fine Swiss watches were available for up to 40% lower prices from the grey market.
&quot;The New York Times&quot; even went after the Rolex Daytona calling it &quot;the hottest watch that money can&#x27;t buy&quot;.

===Sneakers===
One of the biggest grey market marketplaces for sneakers is StockX. Since November 2020, it has also opened up to electronic products with a valuation of almost four billion.

StockX has planned to go public since October 2019. As of January 2022, they had not yet done so.

==Corporate action==
The parties most opposed to the grey market are usually the authorised agents or importers, or the retailers of the item in the target market. Often this is the national subsidiary of the manufacturer, or a related company. In response to the resultant damage to their profits and reputation, manufacturers and their official distribution chain will often seek to restrict the grey market. Such responses can breach competition law, particularly in the European Union. Manufacturers or their licensees often seek to enforce trademark or other intellectual-property laws against the grey market. Such rights may be exercised against the import, sale and/or advertisement of grey imports. In 2002, Levi Strauss, after a 4-year legal case, prevented the UK supermarket Tesco from selling grey market jeans. However, such rights can be limited. Examples of such limitations include the first-sale doctrine in the United States and the doctrine of the exhaustion of rights in the European Union.

When grey-market products are advertised on Google, eBay or other legitimate web sites, it is possible to petition for removal of any advertisements that violate trademark or copyright laws. This can be done directly, without the involvement of legal professionals. For example, eBay will remove listings of such products even in countries where their purchase and use is not against the law. Manufacturers may refuse to supply distributors and retailers (and with commercial products, customers) that trade in grey market goods. They may also more broadly limit supplies in markets where prices are low. Manufacturers may refuse to honor the warranty of an item purchased from grey market sources, on the grounds that the higher price on the non-grey market reflects a higher level of service even though the manufacturer does of course control their own prices to distributors. Alternatively, they may provide the warranty service only from the manufacturer&#x27;s subsidiary in the intended country of import, not the diverted third country where the grey-market goods are ultimately sold by the distributor or retailer. This response to the grey market is especially evident in electronics goods. Local laws (or customer demand) concerning distribution and packaging (for example, the language on labels, units of measurement, and nutritional disclosure on foodstuffs) can be brought into play, as can national standards certifications for certain goods.

Manufacturers may give the same item different model numbers in different countries, even though the functions of the item are identical, so that they can identify grey imports. Manufacturers can also use supplier codes to enable similar tracing of grey imports. Parallel market importers often decode the product in order to avoid the identification of the supplier. In the United States, courts have ruled decoding is legal, however manufacturers and brand owners may have rights if they can prove that the decoding has materially altered the product where certain trademarks have been defaced or the decoding has removed the ability of the manufacturer from enforcing quality-control measures. For example, if the decoding defaces the logo of the product or brand or if the batch code is removed preventing the manufacturer from re-calling defective batches.

The development of DVD region codes, and equivalent regional-lockout techniques in other media, are examples of technological features designed to limit the flow of goods between national markets, effectively fighting the grey market that would otherwise develop. This enables movie studios and other content creators to charge more for the same product in one market than in another, or alternatively withhold the product from some markets for a particular time.

===Canon===

The lawsuits started by Canon U.S.A. Inc. against a number of retailers on 25 October 2015 in the New York Eastern District Court (Case No. 2:15-cv-6019 and No. 2:15-cv-6015) will not be tried until 2016 at the earliest, but are based on a trademark violation. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant retailers applied counterfeit serial numbers to Canon digital SLR cameras and sold kits with inferior (non-Canon) warranties as well as counterfeit batteries and chargers that did not comply with U.S. certification regulations. Canon U.S.A. Inc. also reserves the right to claim damages for &quot;further violations of CUSA&#x27;s intellectual property and other rights [that] will come to light as this litigation progresses&quot;.

===Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement===

The Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement (AGMA) is a California-based non-profit organisation of information technology (IT) companies that works to educate and raise awareness on counterfeiting; digital IP protection; service and warranty abuse; and the grey market.

==Support==
Consumer advocacy groups argue that discrimination against consumers—the charging of higher prices on the same object simply because of where they happen to live—is unjust and monopolistic behaviour on the part of corporations towards the public. Since it requires governments to legislate to prevent their citizens from purchasing goods at cheaper prices from other markets, and because this is clearly not in their citizens&#x27; interests, many governments in democratic countries have chosen not to protect anti-competitive technologies such as DVD region-coding.

Correspondingly, the grey market has found support from most ideological tendencies. Anarchist opponents of class discrimination argue that private property in general leads to the oppression of much of society and are therefore against the very idea of intellectual property, which forms the basis of arguments against the grey market. Proponents of the corporate financial system, in agreement, assert that the enforcement of intellectual property can lead to a &#x27;lessening of composing effort&#x27;.

The grey market has been a constant source of litigation and appeals in the United States. The same fundamental question arises under patent law and copyright law, namely whether or not a good sold abroad lawfully is still protected by United States intellectual property law for the purposes of resale. When purchased domestically, a copyrighted good may be resold by the purchaser under the first-sale doctrine contained at . Similarly, a patented good may be re-sold under the patent exhaustion doctrine. In 2013, the United States Supreme Court largely discussed the legality of the grey market when it decided &quot;Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&quot; where it held that a sale abroad of a copyrighted good triggers the first sale doctrine. The decision is largely understood to apply to patented goods as well.

<doc id="240128" wikidata="Q660898" url="?curid=240128" title="Carbon copy">
<text>Before the development of photographic copiers, a carbon copy was the under-copy of a typed or written document placed over carbon paper and the under-copy sheet itself (not to be confused with the carbon print family of photographic reproduction processes). When copies of business letters were so produced, it was customary to use the acronym &quot;CC&quot; or &quot;cc&quot; before a colon and below the writer&#x27;s signature to inform the principal recipient that carbon copies had been made and distributed to the parties listed after the colon. With the advent of word processors and e-mail, &quot;cc&quot; is used as a merely formal indication of the distribution of letters to secondary recipients.

== Process ==
A sheet of carbon paper is placed between two or more sheets of paper. The pressure applied by the writing implement (pen, pencil, typewriter or impact printer) to the top sheet causes pigment from the carbon paper to reproduce the similar mark on the copy sheet(s). More than one copy can be made by stacking several sheets with carbon paper between each pair. Four or five copies is a practical limit. The top sheet is the &quot;original&quot; and each of the additional sheets is called a carbon copy.

== History ==
While carbon paper was invented by Pellegrino Turri in 1801, it was not widely used for copying until typewriters became common. Carbon copies were in wide use between the 1870s and 1980s, largely for administrative tasks.

== Use ==
The use of carbon copies declined with the advent of photocopying and electronic document creation and distribution (word processing). Carbon copies are still sometimes used in special applications: for example, in manual receipt books which have a multiple-use sheet of carbon paper supplied, so that the user can keep an exact copy of each receipt issued, although even here carbonless copy paper is often used to the same effect.

It is still common for a business letter to include, at the end, a list of names preceded by the abbreviation &quot;CC&quot;, indicating that the named persons are to receive copies of the letter, even though carbon paper is no longer used to make the copies.

An alternative etymology is that &quot;c:&quot; was used for copy and &quot;cc:&quot; indicates the plural, just as &quot;p.&quot; means page and &quot;pp.&quot; means pages. This alternative etymology explains the frequent usage of &quot;c:&quot; when only one recipient is listed, while &quot;cc:&quot; is used for two or more recipients of the copies. This etymology can also explain why, even originally, &quot;cc:&quot; was used to list recipients who received typed copies and not necessarily carbon copies. Sometimes this &quot;cc&quot; is interpreted as &quot;courtesy copy&quot;.

The term &quot;carbon copy&quot; can denote anything that is a near duplicate of an original (&quot;...and you want to turn him into a carbon copy of every fourth-rate conformist in this frightened land!&quot; Robert Heinlein, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;).

===Use as a verb===
Carbon copy can be used as a transitive verb with the meaning described under e-mail below related to the CC field of an e-mail message. That is, to send the message to additional recipients beyond the primary recipient. It is common practice to abbreviate the verb form, and many forms are used, including &quot;cc&quot; and &quot;cc:&quot;. Past tense forms in use are &quot;CCed&quot;, &quot;cc&#x27;d&quot;, &quot;cc&#x27;ed&quot;, &quot;cc-ed&quot; and &quot;cc:&#x27;d&quot;. Present participle or imperfect forms in use include &quot;cc&#x27;ing&quot;. Merriam-Webster uses &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;cc&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;cc&#x27;ing&quot;, respectively.

==Email==
In common usage, an email message has three fields for addressees: the To field is for principal recipients of the message, the Cc field indicates secondary recipients whose names are visible to one another and to the principal, and the Bcc (blind carbon copy) field contains the names of tertiary recipients whose names are invisible to each other and to the primary and secondary recipients.

==Printers==
Impact printers, such as dot matrix and daisy wheel impact printers, are also able to use carbon paper to produce several copies of a document in one pass. Commercial-grade models can print on six-part forms, while less powerful, low-cost ones may print up to three-part forms. Usually, this feature is used in conjunction with continuous, prearranged perforated paper and carbon supplies for use with a tractor feeder, rather than with single sheets of paper, for example, when printing out commercial invoices or receipts.

<doc id="240137" wikidata="Q151877" url="?curid=240137" title="StG 44">
<text>The StG 44 (abbreviation of Sturmgewehr 44, &quot;assault rifle 44&quot;) is a German assault rifle developed during World War II by Hugo Schmeisser. It is also known by its early designations as the MP 43 and MP 44 (&quot;Maschinenpistole 43&quot; and &quot;44&quot;). The StG 44 was an improvement of an earlier design, the Maschinenkarabiner 42(H).

The StG 44 was the first successful assault rifle, with features including an intermediate cartridge, controllable automatic fire, a more compact design than a battle rifle with a higher rate of fire, and being designed primarily for hitting targets within a few hundred metres. Other rifles at the time were designed to hit targets at greater ranges, but this was found to be in excess of the range in which most enemy engagements actually took place.

The StG 44 fulfilled its role effectively, particularly on the Eastern Front, offering a greatly increased volume of fire compared to standard infantry rifles. The StG largely influenced the Soviet AK-47, introduced two years after the war concluded. The StG&#x27;s influence can still be seen in modern assault rifles, which, after World War II, became the global standard for infantry rifles.

==Description==
MP 43, MP 44, and StG 44 were different designations for what was essentially the same rifle with minor updates in production. The variety in nomenclatures resulted from the complicated bureaucracy in Nazi Germany. Developed from the Mkb 42(H) &quot;machine carbine&quot;, the StG 44 combined the characteristics of a carbine, submachine gun, and automatic rifle. StG is an abbreviation of &quot;&quot;. According to one account, the name was chosen personally by Adolf Hitler for propaganda reasons and means &quot;assault rifle&quot; as in &quot;to assault an enemy position&quot;, although some sources dispute that Hitler had much to do with coining the new name besides signing the order. After the adoption of the StG 44, the English translation &quot;assault rifle&quot; became the accepted designation for this type of infantry small arm. Over the course of its production, there were minor changes to the butt end, muzzle nut, shape of the front sight base and stepping of the barrel.

The rifle was chambered for the 7.92×33mm Kurz cartridge. This shorter version of the German standard 7.92×57mm Mauser rifle round, in combination with the weapon&#x27;s selective-fire design, provided a compromise between the controllable firepower of an MP-40 submachine gun at close quarters with the accuracy and power of a Karabiner 98k bolt-action rifle at intermediate ranges. While the StG 44 had less range and power than the more powerful infantry rifles of the day, the German military believed a maximum effective range of 400 m was optimal. Full-power rifle cartridges were excessive for most uses for the average soldier. Only a trained specialist, such as a sniper, or soldiers equipped with machine guns, which fired multiple rounds at a known or suspected target, could make full use of the standard rifle round&#x27;s range and power.

==History==
===Background===
In the late 19th century, small-arms cartridges had become able to fire accurately at long distances. Jacketed bullets propelled by smokeless powder were lethal out to . This was beyond the range a shooter could engage a target with open sights, as at that range a man-sized target would be completely blocked by the front sight blade; only units of riflemen firing by volley could hit grouped targets at those ranges. That fighting style was taken over by the widespread introduction of machine guns, which made use of these powerful cartridges to suppress the enemy at long range. Rifles remained the primary infantry weapon, but in some forces were seen as a secondary or support weapon, backing up the machine guns.

This practice left a large gap in performance: the rifle was not effective at the ranges it could theoretically reach while being much larger and more powerful than needed for close combat. Weapons for short-range use existed, initially semi-automatic pistols and, later, automatic submachine guns. These fired pistol rounds which lacked power, accuracy, and range. They were only useful at very short ranges of no more than . This led to extensive research into creating an intermediate round to fill this gap. This type of ammunition was being considered as early as 1892, but militaries at the time were still fixated on increasing the maximum range and velocity of bullets from their rifles.

===Earlier development===
In early 1918, Piderit, part of the &quot;Gewehrprüfungskommission&quot; (&quot;Small Arms Examination Committee&quot;) of the German General Staff in Berlin, submitted a paper arguing for the introduction of an intermediate round in the German Army with a suitable firearm. He pointed out that firefights rarely took place beyond , about half the sight line range of the 7.92×57mm round from a Mauser Gewehr 98 rifle or less for MG 08 machine gun. A smaller, shorter, and less powerful round would save materials, allow soldiers to carry more ammunition, and increase firepower. Less recoil would allow semi-automatic or even fully automatic select-fire rifles, although in his paper he called it a &quot;Maschinenpistole&quot; (submachine gun). The German Army showed no interest, as it already had the MP 18 submachine gun firing 9 mm pistol rounds and did not want to create a new cartridge.

In 1923, the German Army set out requirements for a Gewehr 98 replacement. It had to be smaller and lighter than the Mauser, have similar performance out to , and have a magazine with a 20- or 30-round capacity. The Bavarian company experimented with rounds in the 1920s, and German companies developing intermediate ammunition for aerial machine guns showed interest. Development of the future infantry rifle did not start until the 1930s. RWS offered two rounds, one with a 7 mm bullet and one with an 8 mm bullet, both in a 46 mm case. The German company Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken had the 7×39.1mm round, and Gustav Genschow &amp; Co (Geco) proposed a 7.75×39.5mm round. Geco&#x27;s automatic carbine was the Model A35, a further development of the SG29 semi-automatic rifle. The weapon was complicated and unsafe to handle.

The German government started its own intermediate round and weapon program soon after. German ammunition maker Polte of Magdeburg was commissioned to develop the rounds in April 1938 and signed a contract with the Heereswaffenamt (HWA). At the same time, the HWA contracted C. G. Haenel of Suhl to create a weapon for the round. HWA requirements were for a rifle that was shorter and with equal or less weight to the Karabiner 98k and as accurate out to ; and be select-fire with a rate of fire under 450 rounds per minute. It should be rifle grenade compatible, reliable, maintainable, and have a &quot;straightforward design&quot;. Fifty rifles were to be delivered for field testing in early 1942.

At the start of World War II, German infantry were equipped with weapons comparable to those of most other military forces. A typical infantry unit was equipped with a mix of bolt-action rifles and some form of light, medium or general-purpose machine gun. A problem with this mix was that the standard rifles were too large to be effectively used by mechanized and armored forces, where they were difficult to maneuver in the cramped spaces of an armored vehicle. Submachine guns, such as the MP 28, MP 38, and MP 40 were issued to augment infantry rifle use and increase individual soldiers&#x27; firepower, but lacked range and accuracy beyond .

===New requirements===
During the invasion of the Soviet Union, increasing numbers of semi-automatic Tokarev SVT-38 and SVT-40s were used by the Red Army – mostly elite units and non-commissioned officers – while some Soviet rifle companies were completely equipped with PPSh-41 submachine guns.

After experiencing high volumes of automatic fire from these weapons, German commanders re-thought their small arms requirements. The German army had been attempting to introduce semi-automatic weapons such as the Gewehr 41, but these proved troublesome in service, and production was insufficient to meet requirements. Several attempts had been made to introduce lightweight machine guns or automatic rifles, but recoil from the powerful 7.92×57mm Mauser round was too difficult to control in automatic fire.

By 1941, it was becoming clear that action needed to be taken. Although various experimental rounds had been developed, the Army ultimately choosing a new design, the Polte 8×33mm &quot;&quot; (&quot;short cartridge&quot;). It used a spitzer bullet and the basic cartridge design of the standard 7.92×57mm Mauser rifle cartridge, cutting down the cartridge from the original 7.92×57mm Mauser to 7.92×33mm Kurz. It was understood that this was not ideal, but it would minimize logistical problems.

====Design influences====

The German 7.92×57mm Mauser chambered FG 42 battle rifle/automatic rifle was one of the first inline firearms incorporating a &quot;straight-line&quot; recoil configuration and an elevated sight line over the bore axis. The inline design helps reduce muzzle rise during automatic fire.

===MKb 42(H) &amp; MKb 42(W)===

Contracts for rifles firing the 7.92×33mm Kurz round were issued to both Walther and Haenel (whose design group was headed by Hugo Schmeisser), were asked to submit prototype weapons under the name &#x27; 1942 (&quot;machine carbine&quot;) or MKb 42&quot;&#x27;. Both designs were similar, using a gas-operated action, with selective fire. Since both rifles shared the title of Maschinenkarabiner 42 the letters (H) and (W) were added to differentiate the two. In this case (H) and (W) were the first initial of each guns manufacturer &quot;Haenel Waffen und Fahrradfabrik&quot; and &quot;Walther Waffenfabrik AG&quot;. The MKb 42(H) along with the less successful MKb 42(W) were predecessors of the later MP 43, MP 44, StG 44. The majority of the MP 43&#x27;s features came from the MKb 42(H), with the hammer firing system and closed bolt coming from the MKb 42(W).

With time, Hitler became aware of the troop trials and ordered that all work on this new weapon be stopped immediately because of the new ammunition. Nonetheless, production was allowed to continue, since the Gustloff company had been developing a machine carbine for normal rifle cartridges as a cover since July 1942.

===MP 43, MP 44, StG 44===
As work moved forward to incorporate this new firing system, Hitler demanded top priority for the production of FG 42 rifles, MP 40 submachine guns and telescopic sights for the Kar98k and Gewehr 41 rifles as well. To keep the MKb 42(H) development program alive, the &quot;Waffenamt&quot; (Armament Office) re-designated the weapon as the Maschinenpistole 43 (MP 43) (&quot;Machine pistol 43&quot;) and, making a few improvements, billed the weapon as an upgrade to existing submachine guns, temporarily deceiving Hitler.

Much time was wasted trying to make the MP 43 a replacement for the Karabiner 98k rifle. This goal was eventually realized to be impossible; the MP 43 cartridge was too weak to fire rifle grenades, too inaccurate for sniping, and the weapon was too short for bayonet fighting. In September 1943, it was decided that the MP 43 would supplement rather than replace the Kar 98k. As a result, the optical sight base, grenade-launching extended muzzle thread, and bayonet lug were removed.

On 6 February 1943, an early production MP 43 was presented to Hitler and Colonel Friedrich Kittel, with the former expressing his considerable annoyance at the change in designation. Shortly after this unveiling, Minister of Armaments Albert Speer sent a telegram from Hitler to the Waffenamt demanding the termination of the machine carbine project. Despite this, a limited production run continued. In the spring of 1943, small batches of the new weapon were used by troops in the Eastern front, with the Army Group North receiving 2,000 MKb 42(H) rifles on 21 April 1943. By the end of the year, it is estimated that a total of 29,500 MKb 42(H) and MP 43/1 rifles were produced in total, with slightly more than half being issued to troops in the field. Meanwhile, officers and other ranks in the Army were showing a growing interest in the machine carbine, with the guards at Hitler&#x27;s headquarters enthusiastically expressing their approval upon receiving the new weapons. Presumably Hitler believed that these guns in particular were already being assembled by the time he gave his order terminating the MP 43 production.

Sometime in 1943, while Hitler was decorating three generals for outstanding service on the Eastern Front he allowed each one to make a request (as was his custom on such ceremonial occasions). They all asked for the same thing: production and issue of the MP 43 for the troops. After further questioning, Hitler was surprised upon learning that limited numbers of the new rifle were already being used on the Eastern Front. He called for full reports from the Army and after reviewing them, Hitler changed his opinion on the MP 43, ordering the monthly production of 30,000 guns alongside the 7.92×33mm Kurz cartridge on 2 October 1943 (the day before, Chief of the Technical Department for Armament Production Karl Saur managed to convince Hitler of the merits of the new weapon). In November 1943, the Army ordered the issue of MP 43s for the troops in the Eastern Front, with the goal of having it as the standard weapon for more than a hundred divisions. Hitler would re-designate the weapon as the Maschinenpistole 44 (MP 44) in April 1944, while the production was given special priority by decree in August 1944.

Around 16−22 October 1944, the new rifle received its final designation, the Sturmgewehr 44 (StG 44) (&quot;Assault rifle 44&quot;). According to Johnston and Nelson, the term was coined by General Erich Jaschke and was accepted by Hitler and all parties associated with the assault rifle program. The final change of name was partly for propaganda purposes, and partly for technical reasons. The change of was to differentiate the new rifle from the MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns, both of which fired 9 mm rounds, preventing any confusion over ammunition supply and it also more accurately described the weapon&#x27;s role, delivering full-automatic fire at short range during the final assault on the enemy&#x27;s lines.

Numerous reports and company correspondence reveal frequent presentation of the rifle&#x27;s stages of development to Hitler. Rather than being opposed to the entire idea, his apprehension may have been from reluctance to send a new weapon to the front in too small numbers. Industry would not be able to replace some 12 million Kar 98k rifles in a short time, and the already strained logistics structure would have to support another cartridge. While the Sturmgewehr required specialized tooling to manufacture it, it consumed less materials and was faster and easier to make than a Kar 98k. Without suppliers to quickly produce components, companies could not manufacture sufficient numbers to replace the Kar 98k quickly. Introducing the new assault rifle in quantities that would not make an impression on the front would be counter-productive. Hitler instead may have wanted to introduce it on the largest scale possible.

Production soon began with the first batches of the new rifle being shipped to troops on the Eastern Front. By the end of the war, a total of 425,977 StG 44 variants of all types were produced and work had commenced on a follow-on rifle, the StG 45. The assault rifle proved a valuable weapon, especially on the Eastern front, where it was first deployed. A properly trained soldier with a StG 44 had an improved tactical repertoire, in that he could effectively engage targets at longer ranges than with an MP 40, but be much more useful than the Kar 98k in close combat, as well as provide covering fire like a light machine gun. It was also found to be exceptionally reliable in extreme cold. The StG 44&#x27;s rate of fire was 540 rpm.
A primary use of the MP 44/StG 44 was to counter the Soviet PPS and PPSh-41 submachine guns, which used the 7.62×25mm Tokarev round. These cheap, mass-produced weapons used a 71-round drum magazine or 35-round box magazine and though shorter-ranged than the Kar 98k rifle, were more effective weapons in close-quarter engagements. The StG 44, while lacking the range of the Kar 98k, had a considerably longer range than the PPS/PPSh submachine guns, more power, an ability to switch between a fully automatic and a default semi-automatic fire mode and surprising accuracy. The StG 44 was an intermediate weapon for the period; the muzzle velocity from its barrel was , compared to of the Karabiner 98k, of the British Bren, of the M1 carbine, and achieved by the MP40. Furthermore, the StG 44&#x27;s inline design gave it controllability even on full-auto.

The 1st Infantry Division of Army Group South and 32nd Infantry Division of Army Group North were selected to be issued the rifle, both being refitted from heavy losses on the Eastern Front; ammunition shortages meant the 1st ID was the only division fully equipped with it. The Kar 98k was retained as a specialist weapon for sniping and launching rifle grenades, while MP 40s were used by vehicle and artillery crews and officers. The StG 44 was issued to all infantry soldiers and employed for accurate short-range rapid-fire shooting (similar to how the MP 18 was used when it went into service). The assault rifles in a squad added firepower when the machine gun had to cease fire or move. When attacking a position, Kar 98k riflemen would employ grenades against at close-range, while StG 44 riflemen would fire in rapid semi-automatic or automatic bursts to keep the defenders suppressed. The magazine follower spring had a short service life, so soldiers were ordered to load no more than 25 rounds to reduce wear of the spring. In January 1945, a magazine was introduced fitted with a fixed plug to restrict its capacity to 25 rounds. While the StG 44 was capable of fully automatic fire, German soldiers were directed to use it primarily in semi-automatic mode. Fully automatic mode was to be used only in emergencies, for short bursts of two or three rounds.

Germany had ammunition logistics problems, thus Hitler&#x27;s calculations came true in part: for the initially planned 200 million rounds per month, 86,000 additional workers were necessary, but were not available. The 400 million rounds per month planned from February 1944 onwards were completely utopian; from February 1945 the number was then reduced to a realistic 110 million.

One unusual addition to the design was the &quot;Krummlauf&quot;; a bent barrel attachment for rifles with a periscope sighting device for shooting around corners from a safe position. It was produced in several variants: an &quot;I&quot; version for infantry use, a &quot;P&quot; version for use in tanks (to cover the dead areas in the close range around the tank, to defend against assaulting infantry), versions with 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° bends, a version for the StG 44 and one for the MG 42. Only the 30° &quot;I&quot; version for the StG 44 was produced in any numbers. The bent barrel attachments had very short lifespans – approx. 300 rounds for the 30° version, and 160 rounds for the 45° variant. The 30° model was able to achieve a 35×35 cm grouping at 100 m.
Some StG 44s were fitted with the Zielgerät 1229 infra-red aiming device, also known by its codename &quot;Vampir&quot; (&quot;vampire&quot;). This device consisted of a large scope, rather like modern starlight scopes, and a large infra-red lamp on top, the scope being able to pick up the infra-red that would be invisible to the naked eye. The user had to carry a transformer backpack powered by a battery fitted inside the gas mask canister. Electric cables connected the power unit with the IR reflector, with the cathode ray tube mounted on the rifle imaging IR from the spotlight. The &quot;Vampir&quot; had only 15 minutes of battery life, but was able to sight within 200 meters in total darkness. A conical flash hider was added to the barrel to keep the muzzle flash from blinding the shooter.

At the end of the war, Hugo Schmeisser claimed that 424,000 MP 43/MP 44/StG 44 rifles were built between June 1943 and April 1945 in four plants: 185,000 by C.G. Haenel in Suhl; 55,000 by J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn in Suhl; 104,000 in Erfurt; and 80,000 by Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG in Steyr, Austria. This was fewer than the 1.5 million ordered, and far fewer than the 4 million planned.

Some 822 million rounds of 7.92×33mm Kurz ammunition were produced from 1942 to 1945. At the beginning of March 1945, the troops had 273.9 million rounds, with a replenishment reserve of 69.6 million rounds on standby.

===Late prototypes===
In a somewhat unrelated development, Mauser continued design work on a series of experimental weapons in an effort to produce an acceptable service-wide rifle for the short cartridge system. One of these prototypes, a product of the engineers at the Light Weapon Development Group (&quot;Abteilung 37&quot;) at Oberndorf, was the MKb &quot;Gerät 06 (&quot;Maschinenkarabiner Gerät 06&quot; or &quot;machine carbine device 06&quot;) first appearing in 1942. This gun used a unique gas piston-delayed roller-locked action derived from the short recoil operation of the MG 42 machine gun but with a fixed barrel and gas system. It was realized that with careful attention to the mechanical ratios, the gas system could be omitted. The resultant weapon, the Gerät 06(H)&quot;, was supposedly slated for adoption by the Wehrmacht as the StG 45(M). The operating principle lived on in postwar designs from CEAM/AME, CETME, and most famously, Heckler &amp; Koch.

Towards the end of the war, there were last-ditch efforts to develop cheap so-called &quot;Volksgewehr&quot; rifles in the 7.92×33mm caliber. One of these, the Gustloff Volkssturmgewehr, used a gas-delayed blowback action based on the Barnitzke system, whereby gas bled from the barrel near the chamber created resistance to the rearward impulse of the operating parts, which ceases when the projectile leaves the muzzle, allowing the operating parts to be forced rearward by the residual pressure of the cartridge case. This principle has been used most successfully in the P7 pistol.

===Post-1945===

The Sturmgewehr remained in use with the East German Nationale Volksarmee with the designation &quot;MPi.44&quot; until it was eventually replaced with domestic variants of the AK-47 assault rifle. The &quot;Volkspolizei&quot; used it until approximately 1962 when it was replaced by the PPSh-41. It was still used by other public security formations thereafter. The ammunition was manufactured there at least until 1961. Other countries to use the StG 44 after World War II included Czechoslovakia (although it was not officially adopted) and Yugoslavia, where units such as the 63rd Paratroop Battalion were equipped with it until the 1980s, when the rifles were ultimately transferred to Territorial Defense reserves or sold to friendly regimes in the Middle East and Africa. France adopted captured StG 44 for colonial Foreign Legion units.

Argentina manufactured their own trial versions of the StG 44 made by CITEFA in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but instead adopted the FN FAL in 1955, because it used the then more common and powerful 7.62×51mm NATO round, which also lacked connections with the Third Reich.

New semi-automatic civilian reproductions of the MKb 42(H), MP 43/1, and StG 44 are being manufactured in Germany today by SSD (Sport Systeme Dittrich) and distributed by HZA Kulmbach GmbH in the original 7.92×33mm Kurz chambering and accepting the standard magazines. The PTR-44 by PTR Industries was produced for a short while, but was soon discontinued due to high prices and lack of demand. A .22 rimfire copy of the StG 44 by GSG (German Sports Guns) has also been manufactured in great quantity for a lower price, but it is the only widely available reproduction of the StG. Talks have been made by HMG (Hill &amp; Mac Gunworks) to mass-produce a StG-44 replica in different calibers, including the original 7.92×33mm Kurz, but also more modern calibers, like 7.62×39mm, 5.56×45mm NATO and .300 AAC Blackout, but these have yet to be released.

7.92mm Kurz ammunition is currently manufactured by Prvi Partizan of Serbia.

===Assessment of the StG 44=== 
A late-war U.S. assessment derided the StG 44 as &quot;mediocre&quot;, &quot;bulky&quot;, and &quot;unhandy&quot;, declaring it incapable of sustained automatic fire and prone to jamming, though the report accepted that its accuracy was &quot;excellent for a weapon of its type&quot;.

According to British Captain Clifford Shore in &quot;With British Snipers to the Reich&quot;, the British found the StG 44 to be poorly made compared to the weapons fielded by the Germans early in World War II.

==Legacy==

The StG 44 was the first assault rifle to be accepted into widespread service and put into mass production. &quot;The principle of this weapon – the reduction of muzzle impulse to get useful automatic fire within actual ranges of combat – was probably the most important advance in small arms since the invention of smokeless powder.&quot; The StG 44&#x27;s effect on post-war arms design was wide-ranging, as made evident by Mikhail Kalashnikov&#x27;s AK-47, and later Eugene Stoner&#x27;s M16 and its variants. The Soviet Union was quick to adopt the assault rifle concept. The AK-47 used a similar-sized intermediate round and followed the design concept, but utilized a rotating bolt as a part of its firing action. In 1944 the US added an automatic fire capability to the M1 carbine, and issued it as the M2 carbine with 30 round magazines, fulfilling much the same function. Kits were distributed to convert M1 carbines to M2s.

The extent to which the Sturmgewehr influenced the development of the AK-47 is not clearly known. Apart from external layout similarity and the gas-operation principle, the AK-47 was not a copy of the German gun because the AK-47 used a very different mechanism. However, tens of thousands of Sturmgewehrs were captured by the Soviets and some were more than likely provided to Kalashnikov and his team. In addition, Hugo Schmeisser was put to work by the Soviets at the Izhmash factory (factory number 74) in Izhevsk until 1952. The 7.62×39 mm cartridge, however, was verifiably influenced by the 7.92×33 mm cartridge used in the StG 44. In July 1943, the Soviet Technical Council of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Armament (NKV) met to consider new foreign weapons firing lower-powered rounds. Two rounds that were studied were the American .30 Carbine and German 7.92 Kurz, captured from MKb 42(H) rifles undergoing troop trials. The meeting concluded that the 7.92 mm cartridge was an important development and that the Soviets needed to design a reduced-power round. The first prototype 7.62 mm M1943 round was created a month later and used the 7.92 Kurz design method of using the same caliber bullet as their standard rifle round (7.62×54mmR) in a shorter case.

After World War II, many Western countries continued using their existing full-caliber rifles. Although the 7.62×51mm NATO round adopted post-war was still a full-power cartridge, the trend towards the adoption of less powerful rounds was already under way in the West. For example, the M1 Garand had initially been developed for the .276 Pedersen (7 mm) round, a cartridge less powerful than the standard .30-06 Springfield. The U.S. Army&#x27;s adoption of the M1 carbine in 1941 proved the utility of a small, handy, low-powered rifle that required little training to use effectively. Franchi of Italy-based the actions of both the LF-58 carbine and the LF-59 battle rifle on the StG-44.

United States and, later, NATO developed assault rifles along a roughly similar path by at first adding selective-fire capability in a reduced power, full-caliber cartridge. The Soviet Union lightened the AK-47 and introduced the AKM. The U.S. developed the concept of small-caliber, high-velocity (SCHV) bullets and further reduced the weight of their firearms with the introduction of the M16 (5.56 mm). The Soviet armed forces followed suit with the introduction of the SCHV AK-74 rifle (5.45 mm).

===Non-state groups===
Captured StG 44 were used by Polish partisan groups during World War II, including during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, although they were not a commonly captured weapon. Relatively large numbers of StG 44 were used post-war by Polish anti-communist resistance groups until the 1950s.

After World War II, the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc states supplied allied regimes and guerrilla movements with captured German arms, such as the StG 44, along with newly manufactured or repackaged 7.92×33mm ammunition. French forces discovered many in Algeria and determined the origin to be from Czechoslovakia. Examples also found their way into the hands of the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, and the PLO. StG44s were used by the WSLF and FLCS insurgents in Somalia.

It is still used in very limited numbers by militia and insurgent forces in the Middle East. StG 44s have been confiscated from militia groups by U.S. forces in Iraq.

In August 2012, the Syrian Al-Tawhid Brigade posted a video clip on their YouTube channel showing a cache of StG 44s in their possession. They claimed to have captured 5,000 StG 44 rifles and ammunition from a weapons depot in the city of Aleppo. Photos later surfaced of the rebels using them in combat. In September 2013, a photo showed a Syrian rebel with a Sturmgewehr 44 connected to a makeshift remote weapon station. The gun was controlled by a wired joystick, vision was provided by a video camera mounted behind a scope, and the picture was displayed on an LCD screen.

In 2013 a small number of StG44 rifles were seized from rebels in Burkina Faso, it is thought that they were looted from government depots during the Libyan Civil War and later sold in the black market.

<text>Lakeside School is a private school located in Seattle, Washington, for grades 5–12. As of 2024, school review website Niche ranked Lakeside School as the best private high school in Washington state and the 52nd best private high school in the United States. Niche also ranked Lakeside as the 28th best high school for STEM in the United States.

==History==

The Moran-Lakeside School was an independent prep school for boys established in 1919 by Frank G. Moran on the shores of Lake Washington in the Denny-Blaine neighborhood of Seattle. The school was intended to feed students to Moran&#x27;s other school, the Moran School on nearby Bainbridge Island. The school was incorporated in 1923 by a group of parents and renamed to Lakeside Day School. It moved a year later to the present site of The Bush School in Washington Park.

A site near Northeast 145th Street in northern Seattle was selected in 1929 for a new campus for the Lakeside Day School, which had outgrown the Washington Park campus. Four buildings were constructed, including dormitories for 30 students and a refectory. The campus opened on September 4, 1930; a year later, the school was renamed to the Lakeside School. Additional buildings were opened during the 1930s despite low enrollment and mounting debt during the Great Depression; several were later named for students who had died during their World War II military service.

Lakeside adopted stricter academic requirements for admissions in the 1950s and launched a zero-fee summer educational program in 1965 with Seattle Public Schools. The first Black students enrolled through the summer program. The formal school uniform was abolished in 1969 by a vote of the student body. By 1971, the boarding program at Lakeside had also ceased. The school became co-educational in a 1971 merger with St. Nicholas School, a Capitol Hill private girls&#x27; school. Initially, the Lakeside campus was used by older students from both schools while the St. Nicholas campus was used by younger students. Three new buildings were constructed at Lakeside to complete the full merger.

== Student life ==
Lakeside has numerous student-initiated and led clubs, such as the Chess Team, Model United Nations, Quiz Bowl, Ethics Bowl, Proof Pioneers, Hackathon, and Imago. Other aspects of student life include the affinity groups, like BSU (Black Student Union), GLOW (Gay Lesbian Or Whatever, a gay-straight alliance club), LAPS (Lakeside Asian/Pacific Islander Students), MIXED (Multicultural Initiators EXperiencing and Encouraging Diversity), and LATISPA (a support network for Latin American students).

== Athletics ==
Lakeside&#x27;s athletic program offers golf, football, soccer, volleyball, crew, wrestling, baseball, basketball, ultimate frisbee, tennis, swimming, diving, cross country, and track and field as well as a strength and conditioning program. In recent years, the boys&#x27; swim team won a 3A WIAA state championship in the 2011–2012 season, the 2012–2013 season, and the 2023–2024 season. The 2013-2014 boys&#x27; soccer team won the WIAA state championship in the 3A division. The 2014 girls&#x27; swim team won the 3A WIAA state championship for the first time in school history, and won the 2015 state championship as well. The 2016 volleyball team won the 3A WIAA state championship for the first time in school history. The 2021 girls&#x27; soccer team won the 3A WIAA state championship for the first time since 2003.
