<text>The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church () is the largest of the Oriental Orthodox Churches. One of the few Christian churches in sub-Saharan Africa originating before European colonization of the continent, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church dates back to the Christianization of the Kingdom of Aksum in 330, and has between 36 million and 51 million adherents in Ethiopia. It is a founding member of the World Council of Churches. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is in communion with the other Oriental Orthodox churches (the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, and the Syriac Orthodox Church).

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church had been administratively part of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria from the first half of the 4th century until 1959, when it was granted autocephaly with its own patriarch by Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria, Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church.

&quot;Tewahedo&quot; ( &quot;täwaḥədo&quot;) is a Geʽez word meaning &quot;united as one.&quot; This word refers to the Oriental Orthodox belief in Miaphysitism, meaning one perfectly unified nature of Christ; i.e., a complete union of the divine and human natures into one nature is self-evident to accomplish the divine salvation of mankind, as opposed to the &quot;two natures of Christ&quot; belief commonly held by the Latin and Eastern Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, and most other Protestant churches. The Oriental Orthodox Churches adhere to a miaphysite Christological view followed by Cyril of Alexandria, the leading protagonist in the Christological debates of the 4th and 5th centuries, who advocated &quot;mia physis tou Theo logou sesarkōmenē&quot;, or &quot;one (mia) nature of the Word of God incarnate&quot; (μία φύσις τοῦ θεοῦ λόγου σεσαρκωμένη) and a hypostatic union (ἕνωσις καθ&#x27; ὑπόστασιν, &quot;henōsis kath hypostasis&quot;). The distinction of this stance was that the incarnate Christ has one nature, but that one nature is of the two natures, divine and human, and retains all the characteristics of both after the union.

Miaphysitism holds that in the one person of Jesus Christ, divinity and humanity are united in one (μία, &quot;mia&quot;) nature (φύσις - &quot;physis&quot;) without separation, without confusion, without alteration and without mixing where Christ is consubstantial with God the Father. Around 500 bishops within the patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem refused to accept the dyophysitism (two natures) doctrine decreed by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, an incident that resulted in the second major split in the main body of the Catholic-Orthodox Church in the Roman Empire.

==Name==

&quot;Tewahedo&quot; ( &quot;täwaḥədo&quot;) is a Geʽez word meaning &quot;being made one&quot; or &quot;unified&quot; (see also the Arabic word Tawhid). This word refers to the Oriental Orthodox belief in the one composite unified nature of Christ; i.e., a belief that a complete, natural union of the divine and human natures into one is self-evident to accomplish the divine salvation of humankind. This is in contrast to the &quot;two natures of Christ&quot; belief (unmixed, but unseparated divine and human natures, called the hypostatic union) which is held by the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The Oriental Orthodox Churches are known as &quot;non-Chalcedonian&quot;, and, sometimes by outsiders as &quot;monophysite&quot; (meaning &quot;One Single Nature&quot;, in allusion to Jesus Christ). However, these churches themselves describe their Christology as miaphysite, meaning &quot;one united nature&quot; about Jesus (the Greek equivalent of &quot;Tewahedo&quot;).

==History==
===Origins===

John Chrysostom speaks of the &quot;Ethiopians present in Jerusalem&quot; as being able to understand the preaching of Peter in Acts, 2:38. Possible missions of some of the Apostles in the lands now called Ethiopia is also reported as early as the 4th century. Socrates of Constantinople includes Ethiopia in his list as one of the regions preached by Matthew the Apostle, where a specific mention of &quot;Ethiopia south of the Caspian Sea&quot; can be confirmed in some traditions such as the Roman Catholic Church among others. Ethiopian Church tradition tells that Bartholomew accompanied Matthew in a mission which lasted for at least three months. Paintings depicting these missions can be seen in the Church of St. Matthew found in the Province of Pisa, in northern Italy portrayed by Francesco Trevisan (1650–1740) and Marco Benefial (1688–1764).

The earliest account of an Ethiopian converted to the faith in the New Testament books is a royal official baptized by Philip the Evangelist (distinct from Philip the Apostle), one of the seven deacons (Acts, 8:26–27):
The passage continues by describing how Philip helped the Ethiopian treasurer understand a passage from the Book of Isaiah that the Ethiopian was reading. After Philip interpreted the passage as prophecy referring to Jesus Christ, the Ethiopian requested that Philip baptize him, and Philip did so. The Ethiopic version of this verse reads &quot;Hendeke&quot; (ህንደኬ); Queen Gersamot Hendeke VII was the Queen of Ethiopia from c. 42 to 52. Where the possibility of gospel missions by the Ethiopian eunuch cannot be directly inferred from the Books of the New Testament, Irenaeus of Lyons around 180 AD writes that &quot;Simon Backos&quot; preached the good news in his homeland outlining also the theme of his preaching as being the coming in flesh of God that &quot;was preached to you all before.&quot; The same kind of witness is shared by 3rd and 4th century writers such as Eusebius of Caesarea and Origen of Alexandria.

Early Christianity became the established church of the Ethiopian Axumite Kingdom under king Ezana in the 4th century when priesthood and the sacraments were brought for the first time through a Syrian Greek named Frumentius, known by the local population in Ethiopia as &quot;Selama, Kesaté Birhan&quot; (&quot;Father of Peace, Revealer of Light&quot;). As a youth, Frumentius had been shipwrecked with his brother Aedesius on the Eritrean coast. The brothers managed to be brought to the royal court, where they rose to positions of influence and baptized Emperor Ezana. Frumentius is also believed to have established the first monastery in Ethiopia, named Dabba Selama after him. In 2016, archaeologists excavated a 4th-century AD basilica (radio-carbon dated) in northeastern Ethiopia at a site called Beta Samati. This is the earliest known physical evidence of a church in sub-Saharan Africa.

===Middle Ages===

Union with the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria continued after the Arab conquest of Egypt. Abu Saleh records in the 12th century that the patriarch always sent letters twice a year to the kings of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and Nubia, until Al Hakim stopped the practice. Cyril, 67th patriarch, sent Severus as bishop, with orders to put down polygamy and to enforce the observance of canonical consecration for all churches. These examples show the close relations of the two churches throughout the Middle Ages. In 1439, in the reign of Zara Yaqob, a religious discussion between Giyorgis and a French visitor led to the dispatch of an embassy from Ethiopia to the Vatican.

===Jesuit interim===
The period of Jesuit influence, which broke the connection with Egypt, began a new chapter in church history. The initiative in Roman Catholic missions to Ethiopia was taken not by Rome, but by Portugal, in the course of a conflict with the Muslim Ottoman Empire and the Sultanate of Adal for the command of the trade route to India via the Red Sea.

In 1507, Mateus, or Matthew, an Armenian, had been sent as an Ethiopian envoy to Portugal. In 1520, an embassy under Dom Rodrigo de Lima landed in Ethiopia. An interesting account of the Portuguese mission, which lasted for several years, was written by Francisco Álvares, its chaplain.

Later, Ignatius Loyola wished to take up the task of conversion, but was forbidden to do so. Instead, the pope sent out João Nunes Barreto as patriarch of the East Indies, with Andrés de Oviedo as bishop; and from Goa envoys went to Ethiopia, followed by Oviedo himself, to secure the king&#x27;s adherence to Rome. After repeated failures some measure of success was achieved under Emperor Susenyos I, but not until 1624 did the Emperor make formal submission to the pope. Susenyos made Roman Catholicism the official state religion but was met with heavy resistance by his subjects and by the authorities of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and eventually had to abdicate in 1632 in favour of his son, Fasilides, who promptly restored Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity as the state religion. He then in 1633 expelled the Jesuits, and in 1665 Fasilides ordered that all Jesuit books (the Books of the Franks) be burned.

===Influence on the Reformation===

David Daniels has suggested that the Ethiopian Church has had a stronger impact on the Reformation than most scholars acknowledge. For Martin Luther, who spearheaded the Reformation, Daniels says &quot;the Ethiopian Church conferred legitimacy on Luther&#x27;s emerging Protestant vision of a church outside the authority of the Roman Catholic papacy&quot; as it was &quot;an ancient church with direct ties to the apostles&quot;. According to Daniels, Martin Luther saw that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church practiced elements of faith including &quot;communion under both kinds, vernacular Scriptures, and married clergy&quot; and these practices became customary in the Lutheran churches. The Ethiopian church also rejected papal supremacy, purgatory and indulgences, which the Lutherans disagreed with, and thus for Luther, the Ethiopian church was the &quot;true forerunner of Protestantism&quot;. Luther believed that the Ethiopian church kept true apostolic practices which the Lutherans would adopt through reading the scriptures.

In 1534, a cleric of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Michael the Deacon, met with Martin Luther and affirmed the Augsburg Confession, saying &quot;This is a good creed, that is, faith&quot;. In addition, Martin Luther stated that the Lutheran Mass agreed with that used by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. As a result, Luther invited the Ethiopian church and Michael to full fellowship.

===Recent history===

In more modern times, the Ethiopian Church has experienced a series of developments. The 19th century witnessed the publication of an Amharic translation of the Bible. Largely the work of Abu Rumi over ten years in Cairo, this version, with some changes, held sway until Emperor Haile Selassie ordered a new translation which appeared in 1960/1. Haile Selassie also played a prominent role in further reforms of the church, which included encouraging the distribution of Abu Rumi&#x27;s translation throughout Ethiopia, as well as his promotion of improved education of clergy, a significant step in the Emperor&#x27;s effort being the founding of the Theological College of the Holy Trinity Church in December 1944. A third development came after Haile Selassie&#x27;s restoration to Ethiopia, when he issued, on 30 November, Decree Number 2 of 1942, a new law reforming the church. The primary objectives of this decree were to put the finances of the church in order, to create a central fund for its activities, and to set forth requirements for the appointment of clergy—which had been fairly lax until then.

The Coptic and Ethiopian churches reached an agreement on 13 July 1948, that led to autocephaly for the Ethiopian Church. Five bishops were immediately consecrated by the Coptic Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, empowered to elect a new patriarch for their church, and the successor to Qerellos IV would have the power to consecrate new bishops. This promotion was completed when Coptic Orthodox Pope Joseph II consecrated an Ethiopian-born Archbishop, Abuna Basilios, 14 January 1951. Then in 1959, Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria crowned Basilios as the first Patriarch of Ethiopia.

Basilios died in 1970, and was succeeded that year by Tewophilos. With the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was disestablished as the state church. The new Marxist government began nationalizing property (including land) owned by the church. Tewophilos was arrested in 1976 by the Marxist Derg military junta, and secretly executed in 1979. The government ordered the church to elect a new Patriarch, and Takla Haymanot was enthroned. The Coptic Orthodox Church refused to recognize the election and enthronement of Tekle Haymanot on the grounds that the Synod of the Ethiopian Church had not removed Tewophilos and that the government had not publicly acknowledged his death, and he was thus still the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the two churches were halted, although they remained in communion with each other. Formal relations between the two churches resumed on July 13, 2007.

Tekle Haymanot proved to be much less accommodating to the Derg regime than it had expected, and so when the patriarch died in 1988, a new patriarch with closer ties to the regime was sought. The Archbishop of Gondar, a member of the Derg-era Ethiopian Parliament, was elected and enthroned as Abuna Merkorios. Following the fall of the Derg regime in 1991, and the coming to power of the EPRDF government, Merkorios abdicated under public pressure. The church then elected a new Patriarch, Paulos, who was recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria. The former Merkorios then fled abroad, and announced from exile that his abdication had been made under duress and thus he was still the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Several bishops also went into exile and formed a break-away alternate synod. The Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church was granted autocephaly from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church on 28 September 1993 following ratification by Coptic church Patriarch Shenouda III. The schism has met opposition from dissent that saw it as a disintegration of Ethiopia&#x27;s spiritual heritage.

There are many Ethiopian Orthodox churches located throughout the United States and other countries to which Ethiopians have migrated (Archbishop Yesehaq 1997).

Paulos died on 16 August 2012. On 28 February 2013, a college of electors assembled in Addis Ababa and elected Mathias to be the 6th Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

On 25 July 2018, delegates from the Patriarchate in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and those in the United States, declared reunification in Washington, D.C. Declaring the end of a 26-year-old schism, the church announced that it acknowledges two Patriarchs, Merkorios, Fourth Patriarch of Ethiopia and Mathias I, Sixth Patriarch and Catholicos of Ethiopia, Archbishop of Axum and Ichege of the See of Saint Taklehaimanot. After the reunification of the church fathers Abune Merkorios,the fourth Patriarch of Ethiopia died on 3 March 2022.

On 22 January 2023, an attempt to overthrow Abune Mathias was failed following a secret formation of new 26-made bishop Synod led by Abune Sawiros in Oromia Region diocese, such as in Haro Beale Wold Church in Woliso, and nine bishops of diocese outside the region. The Patriarchate called it an &quot;illegal appointment&quot;, where Abune Mathias decried it as &quot;great event that has targeted the church&quot;.
After not apologising for the illegal ordination, three Archbishops were excommunicated by the Holy Synod on 26 January. On 31 January 2023, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed convened a discussion surrounding the incident where he responded he is ready to resolve the conflict. The speech led backlash from the Holy Synod and accused his government of meddling in the Church in reference to separation of church and state in the Article 11 of the FDRE Constitution.

On 4 February, three people were reportedly killed in Shashemene by the Oromia Special Forces. According Tewahedo Media Center (TMC), two Orthodox youth were killed and four others were injured by the Oromo Special Forces. Abune Henok, Archbishop of Addis Ababa Diocese described it as &quot;shameful and heart-wrenching&quot;. In response to grievance, numerous celebrities expressed their solidarity to the Church via social media and other platforms and donned black clothing during three-days Fast of Nineveh. On 9 February, the government imposed restrictions on social sites targeted to Facebook, Messenger, Telegram and TikTok. On the next day, the delegation of Synod held an urgent meeting with Abiy at his office, which resulted in condemnation of the proclaimed Oromia Synod from Abiy. On 12 February, a nationwide protest was postponed. Abune Petros, the Secretary of the Holy Synod announced that the demonstration would be postponed following peaceful talks with the Prime Minister and a government agreement to solve the problem. On 15 February, the Church reached an agreement with the illegally ordinated synod. The government lifted the internet ban after five months on 17 July.

==Traditions==
The faith and practice of Orthodox Ethiopian Christians include elements from Miaphysite Christianity as it has developed in Ethiopia over the centuries. Christian beliefs include belief in God (in Geʽez / Amharic, &quot;′Egziabeher&quot;, lit. &quot;Lord of the Universe&quot;), veneration of the Virgin Mary, the angels, and the saints, besides others. According to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church itself, there are no non-Christian elements in the religion other than those from the Old Testament, or &quot;Həggä &#x27;Orät&quot; (ሕገ ኦሪት), to which are added those from the New Testament, or &quot;Həggä Wongel&quot; (ሕገ ወንጌል). A hierarchy of &quot;K&#x27;ədusan&quot; ቅዱሳን (angelic messengers and saints) conveys the prayers of the faithful to God and carries out the divine will, so when an Ethiopian Christian is in difficulty, he or she appeals to them as well as to God. In more formal and regular rituals, priests communicate on behalf of the community, and only priests may enter the inner sanctum of the usually circular or octagonal church where the tabot (&quot;ark&quot;) dedicated to the church&#x27;s patron saint is housed. On important religious holidays, the tabot is carried on the head of a priest and escorted in procession outside the church. It is the tabot, not the church, which is consecrated. At many services, most parish members remain in the outer ring, where debteras sing hymns and dance.

The Eucharist is given only to those who feel pure, have fasted regularly, and have, in general, properly conducted themselves. In practice, communion is mainly limited to young children and the elderly; those who are at a sexually active age or who have sexual desires generally do not receive the Eucharist. Worshipers receiving communion may enter the middle ring of the church to do so.

Ethiopian Orthodox believers are strict Trinitarians, maintaining the Orthodox teaching that God is united in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This concept is known as &quot;səllase&quot; (ሥላሴ), Geʽez for &quot;Trinity&quot;.

Daily services constitute only a small part of an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian&#x27;s religious observance. Several holy days require prolonged services, singing and dancing, and feasting.

=== Fast days ===
An important religious requirement, however, is the keeping of fast days, during which adherents abstain from consuming meat and animal products, and refrain from sexual activity. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has 250 fasting days, 180 of which are obligatory for laypeople, not just monks and priests, when vegan food is eaten by the faithful. During the 40-day Advent fast, only one vegan meal is allowed per day.

#Fast for Hudadi or Abiye Tsome [ሁዳዴ/ዓብይ ጾም] (Great Lent), 55 days prior to Easter (&quot;Fasika&quot;). This fast is divided into three separate periods: Tsome Hirkal (ጾመ ህርቃል), eight days commemorating Heraclius; Tsome Arba (ጾመ አርባ), forty days of Lent; and Tsome Himamat (ጾመ ሕማማት), seven days commemorating Holy Week.
#Fast of the Apostles, 10–40 days, which the Apostles kept after they had received the Holy Spirit. It begins after Pentecost.
#The fast Tsome Dihnet (ጾመ ድህነት), which is on Wednesdays in commemoration of the plot organized to kill Jesus Christ by Caiaphas and the members of the house of the high priest and Fridays in commemoration of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ (starts on Wednesday after Pentecost and spans up to Easter, in other words all Wednesdays and Fridays except during 50 days after Easter).
#The fast of Dormition, 16 days.
#The fast preceding Christmas, 40 days (Advent). It begins with Sibket on 15th Hedar and ends on Christmas Eve with the feast of Gena and the 29th of Tahsas and 28th if the year is preceded by leap year.
#The Fast of Nineveh, commemorating the preaching of Jonah. It comes on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the third week before Lent.
#The &quot;gahad&quot; of Timkat (Epiphany), fast on the eve of Epiphany.

In addition to standard holy days, most Christians observe many saints&#x27; days. A man might give a small feast on his personal saint&#x27;s day. The local voluntary association (called the &quot;maheber&quot;) connected with each church honours its patron saint with a special service and a feast two or three times a year.

=== Monasticism ===
===Exorcism===
Priests intervene and perform exorcisms on behalf of those believed to be afflicted by demons or &quot;buda&quot;. According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study, 74% of Christians in Ethiopia report having experienced or witnessed an exorcism. Demon-possessed persons are brought to a church or prayer meeting. Often, when an ill person has not responded to modern medical treatment, the affliction is attributed to demons. Unusual or especially perverse deeds, particularly when performed in public, are symptomatic of a demoniac. Superhuman strength—such as breaking one&#x27;s bindings, as described in the New Testament accounts—along with glossolalia are observed in the afflicted. Amsalu Geleta, in a modern case study, relates elements that are common to Ethiopian Christian exorcisms:

It includes singing praise and victory songs, reading from the Scripture, prayer and confronting the spirit in the name of Jesus. Dialogue with the spirit is another important part of the exorcism ceremony. It helps the counsellor (exorcist) to know how the spirit was operating in the life of the demoniac. The signs and events mentioned by the spirit are affirmed by the victim after deliverance.

The exorcism is not always successful, and Geleta notes another instance in which the usual methods were unsuccessful, and the demons apparently left the subject at a later time. In any event, &quot;in all cases the spirit is commanded in no other name than the name of Jesus.&quot;

===Language===

The divine services of the Ethiopian Church are celebrated in Geʽez, which has been the liturgical language of the church at least since the arrival of the Nine Saints (Pantelewon, Gerima (Isaac, or Yeshaq), Aftse, Guba, Alef, Yem’ata, Liqanos, and Sehma), who are believed to have fled persecution by the Byzantine Empire after the Council of Chalcedon (451). The Greek Septuagint was the version of the Old Testament originally translated into Ge&#x27;ez, but later revisions show clear evidence of the use of Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic sources. The first translation into a modern vernacular was done in the 19th century by a man usually known as Abu Rumi (died 1819). Later, Haile Selassie sponsored Amharic translations of the Ge&#x27;ez Scriptures during his reign (1930–1974): one in 1935 before World War II and one afterwards (1960–1961). Sermons today are usually delivered in the local language.

===Architecture===

There are many monolithic (rock-hewn) churches in Ethiopia, most famously eleven churches at Lalibela. Besides these, two main types of architecture are found—one basilican, the other native. The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion at Axum is an example of the basilican design, though the early basilicas are nearly all in ruin. These examples show the influence of the architects who, in the 6th century, built the basilicas at Sanʻāʼ and elsewhere in the Arabian Peninsula. There are two forms of native churches: one oblong, traditionally found in Tigray; the other circular, traditionally found in Amhara and Shewa (though either style may be found elsewhere). In both forms, the sanctuary is square and stands clear in the centre, and the arrangements are based on Jewish tradition. Walls and ceilings are adorned with frescoes. A courtyard, circular or rectangular, surrounds the body of the church. Modern Ethiopian churches may incorporate the basilican or native styles and use contemporary construction techniques and materials. In rural areas, the church and outer court are often thatched, with mud-built walls. The church buildings are typically surrounded by a forested area, acting as a reservoir of biodiversity in otherwise de-forested parts of the country.

===Ark of the Covenant===

The Ethiopian Church claims that one of its churches, Our Lady Mary of Zion, is host to the original Ark of the Covenant that Moses carried with the Israelites during the Exodus. Only one priest is allowed into the building where the Ark is located, ostensibly due to biblical warnings of danger. As a result, international scholars doubt that the original Ark is truly there.

Throughout Ethiopia, Orthodox churches are not considered churches until the local bishop gives them a &quot;tabot&quot;, a replica of the original Ark of the Covenant. The &quot;tabot&quot; is at least six inches (15 cm) square, and it is made of either alabaster, marble, or wood (see acacia). It is always kept in ornate coverings on the altar. Only priests are allowed to see or touch the &quot;tabot&quot;. In an elaborate procession, the &quot;tabot&quot; is carried around the outside of the church amid joyful song on the feast day of that particular church&#x27;s namesake. On the great Feast of T&#x27;imk&#x27;et, known as Epiphany or Theophany in Europe, a group of churches send their &quot;tabot&quot; to celebrate the occasion at a common location where a pool of water or a river is to be found.

===Similarities to Judaism and Islam===

The Ethiopian Church places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in other churches. Women are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or &quot;shash&quot;) while in church, as described in 1 Corinthians, chapter 11. As with Orthodox synagogues, men and women sit separately in the Ethiopian church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar). (Women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in churches officially is common to few other Christian traditions; it is also the rule in some non-Christian religions, Islam and Orthodox Judaism among them).

Before praying, the Ethiopian Orthodox remove their shoes in order to acknowledge that one is offering prayer before a holy God. Ethiopian Orthodox worshippers remove their shoes when entering a church temple, in accordance with Exodus 3:5 (in which Moses, while viewing the burning bush, was commanded to remove his shoes while standing on holy ground). Furthermore, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is known to observe the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday, or the lesser Sabbath), in addition to the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday, or the Christian Sabbath), recognizing both to be holy days of joy, prayer, and contemplation, although more emphasis, because of the Resurrection of Christ, is laid upon Sunday. While the Ethiopian Church is known for this practice, it is neither an innovation nor unique to it, deriving from the Apostolic Constitutions and the Apostolic Canons the former of which without the Apostolic Canons included is in the church&#x27;s 81-book canon as the &quot;Didascalia&quot;. The nature of the Sabbath only became a doctrinal dispute in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in the centuries leading up to the issue being rectified by Ewostatewos. The emperor Gelawdewos in his &quot;Confession&quot;, an apologia of traditional beliefs and practices says &quot;we do not honour it as the Jews do... but we so honour it that we celebrate thereon the Eucharist and have love-feasts, even as our Fathers the Apostles have taught us in the Didascalia&quot;.

The Ethiopian Church does not call for circumcision, yet it is a cultural practice, as is abstention from pork and other meats deemed unclean. It is not regarded as being necessary to salvation. The liturgy mentions, &quot;let us not be circumcised like the Jews.&quot;

The Ethiopian Orthodox Church observes days of ritual purification. People who are ritually unclean may approach the church but are not permitted to enter it; they instead stand near the church door and pray during the liturgy.

Rugare Rukuni and Erna Oliver identify the Nine Saints as Jewish Christians, and attribute the Judaic character of Ethiopian Christianity, in part, to their influence.

===Debtera===
A debtera is an itinerant lay priest figure (not a member of the priesthood) trained by the Ethiopian Church to function principally as a scribe or cantor. But often he is also a folk healer, who may also function in roles comparable to a deacon or exorcist. Folklore and legends ascribe the role of magician to the debtera as well.

===Music===
The music of Ethiopian Orthodox Church traced back to Saint Yared, who composed Zema or &quot;chant&quot;, which divided into three modes: Geʽez (ordinary days), Ezel (fast days and Lent) and Araray (principal feasts). It is important to Ethiopian liturgy and divided into fourteen Anaphoras, the normal use being of the Twelve Apostles. In ancient times, there were six Anaphoras used by many monasteries.

== Patriarch-Catholicoi, archbishops and bishops ==

;Patriarch-Catholicos

Since 1959, when the church was granted autocephaly by Cyril VI, Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, an Ethiopian Patriarch-Catholicos of Eritrea also carrying the title of Abuna is the head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The Abuna is officially known as &quot;Patriarch and Catholicos of Ethiopia, Archbishop of Axum and Ichege of the See of Saint Taklahaimanot&quot;. The incumbent head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is Mathias who acceded to this position on 28 February 2013.

<doc id="229436" wikidata="Q1162680" url="?curid=229436" title="Tropospheric scatter">
<text>Tropospheric scatter, also known as troposcatter, is a method of communicating with microwave radio signals over considerable distances – often up to and further depending on frequency of operation, equipment type, terrain, and climate factors. This method of propagation uses the tropospheric scatter phenomenon, where radio waves at UHF and SHF frequencies are randomly scattered as they pass through the upper layers of the troposphere. Radio signals are transmitted in a narrow beam aimed just above the horizon in the direction of the receiver station. As the signals pass through the troposphere, some of the energy is scattered back toward the Earth, allowing the receiver station to pick up the signal.

Normally, signals in the microwave frequency range travel in straight lines, and so are limited to &quot;line-of-sight&quot; applications, in which the receiver can be &#x27;seen&#x27; by the transmitter. Communication distances are limited by the visual horizon to around . Troposcatter allows microwave communication beyond the horizon. It was developed in the 1950s and used for military communications until communications satellites largely replaced it in the 1970s.

Because the troposphere is turbulent and has a high proportion of moisture, the tropospheric scatter radio signals are refracted and consequently only a tiny proportion of the transmitted radio energy is collected by the receiving antennas. Frequencies of transmission around are best suited for tropospheric scatter systems as at this frequency the wavelength of the signal interacts well with the moist, turbulent areas of the troposphere, improving signal-to-noise ratios.

==Overview==
===Discovery===
Prior to World War II, prevailing radio physics theory predicted a relationship between frequency and diffraction that suggested radio signals would follow the curvature of the Earth, but that the strength of the effect would fall off rapidly and especially at higher frequencies. In spite of this widespread belief, during the war there were numerous incidents in which high-frequency radar signals were able to detect targets at ranges far beyond the theoretical calculations. In spite of these repeated instances of anomalous range, the matter was never seriously studied.

In the immediate post-war era, the limitation on television construction was lifted in the United States and millions of sets were sold. This drove an equally rapid expansion of new television stations. Based on the same calculations used during the war, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) arranged frequency allocations for the new VHF and UHF channels to avoid interference between stations. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, interference was common, even between widely separated stations. As a result, licenses for new stations were put on hold in what is known as the &quot;television freeze&quot; of 1948.

Bell Labs was among the many organizations that began studying this effect, and concluded it was a previously unknown type of reflection off the tropopause. This was limited to higher frequencies, in the UHF and microwave bands, which is why it had not been seen prior to the war when these frequencies were beyond the ability of existing electronics. Although the vast majority of the signal went through the troposphere and on to space, the tiny amount that was reflected was useful if combined with powerful transmitters and very sensitive receivers. In 1952, Bell began experiments with Lincoln Labs, the MIT-affiliated radar research lab. Using Lincoln&#x27;s powerful microwave transmitters and Bell&#x27;s sensitive receivers, they built several experimental systems to test a variety of frequencies and weather effects. When Bell Canada heard of the system they felt it might be useful for a new communications network in Labrador and took one of the systems there for cold weather testing.

In 1954 the results from both test series were complete and construction began on the first troposcatter system, the Pole Vault system that linked Pinetree Line radar systems along the coast of Labrador. Using troposcatter reduced the number of stations from 50 microwave relays scattered through the wilderness to only 10, all located at the radar stations. In spite of their higher unit costs, the new network cost half as much to build as a relay system. Pole Vault was quickly followed by similar systems like White Alice, relays on the Mid-Canada Line and the DEW Line, and during the 1960s, across the Atlantic Ocean and Europe as part of NATO&#x27;s ACE High system.

===Use===
The propagation losses are very high; only about one trillionth () of the transmit power is available at the receiver. This demands the use of antennas with extremely large antenna gain. The original Pole Vault system used large parabolic reflector dish antennas, but these were soon replaced by billboard antennas which were somewhat more robust, an important quality given that these systems were often found in harsh locales. Paths were established at distances over . They required antennas ranging from and amplifiers ranging from to . These were analogue systems which were capable of transmitting a few voice channels.

Troposcatter systems have evolved over the years. With communication satellites used for long-distance communication links, current troposcatter systems are employed over shorter distances than previous systems, use smaller antennas and amplifiers, and have much higher bandwidth capabilities. Typical distances are between , though greater distances can be achieved depending on the climate, terrain, and data rate required. Typical antenna sizes range from while typical amplifier sizes range from to . Data rates over can be achieved with today&#x27;s technology.

Tropospheric scatter is a fairly secure method of propagation as dish alignment is critical, making it extremely difficult to intercept the signals, especially if transmitted across open water, making them highly attractive to military users. Military systems have tended to be ‘thin-line’ tropo – so called because only a narrow bandwidth ‘information’ channel was carried on the tropo system; generally up to 32 analogue ( bandwidth) channels. Modern military systems are &quot;wideband&quot; as they operate 4-16 Mbit/s digital data channels.

Civilian troposcatter systems, such as the British Telecom (BT) North Sea oil communications network, required higher capacity ‘information’ channels than were available using HF (high frequency – to ) radio signals, before satellite technology was available. The BT systems, based at Scousburgh in the Shetland Islands, Mormond Hill in Aberdeenshire and Row Brow near Scarborough, were capable of transmitting and receiving 156 analogue ( bandwidth) channels of data and telephony to / from North Sea oil production platforms, using frequency-division multiplexing (FDMX) to combine the channels.
Because of the nature of the turbulence in the troposphere, quadruple diversity propagation paths were used to ensure reliability of the service, equating to about 3 minutes of downtime due to propagation drop out per month. The quadruple space and polarisation diversity systems needed two separate dish antennas (spaced several metres apart) and two differently polarised feed horns – one using vertical polarisation, the other using horizontal polarisation. This ensured that at least one signal path was open at any one time. The signals from the four different paths were recombined in the receiver where a phase corrector removed the phase differences of each signal. Phase differences were caused by the different path lengths of each signal from transmitter to receiver. Once phase corrected, the four signals could be combined additively.

<text>A skip distance is the distance a radio wave travels, usually including a hop in the ionosphere. A skip distance is a distance on the Earth&#x27;s surface between the two points where radio waves from a transmitter, refracted downwards by different layers of the ionosphere, fall. It also represents how far a radio wave has travelled per hop on the Earth&#x27;s surface, for radio waves such as the short wave (SW) radio signals that employ continuous reflections for transmission.

==Propagation Path==

Radio waves from a particular transmitting antenna do not all get refracted by a particular layer of the ionosphere; some are absorbed, some refracted while a portion escapes to the next layer. At this higher layer, there is a possibility of this radio wave being bent downwards to earth again. This bending happens because each layer of the ionosphere has a refractive index that varies from that of the others. Because of the differing heights of refraction, or apparent reflection, the radio waves hit the earth surface at different points hence generating the skip distance. Skip distance is greatest during the night when the ionosphere is the highest.

<text>A broadcast range (also listening range or listening area for radio, or viewing range or viewing area for television) is the service area that a broadcast station or other transmission covers via radio waves (or possibly infrared light, which is closely related). It is generally the area in which a station&#x27;s signal strength is sufficient for most receivers to decode it. However, this also depends on interference from other stations.

==Legal definitions==
The &quot;primary service area&quot; is the area served by a station&#x27;s strongest signal. The &quot;city-grade contour&quot; is 70 dBμ (decibels relative to one microvolt per meter of signal strength) or 3.16mV/m (millivolts per meter) for FM stations in the United States, according to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. This is also significant in broadcast law, in that a station must cover its city of license within this area, except for non-commercial educational and low-power stations.

The legally protected range of a station extends beyond this range, out to the point where signal strength is expected to be 1mV/m for most stations in North America, though for class B1 stations it is 0.7mV/m, and as low as 0.5mV/m for full class B stations (the maximum allowed in densely populated areas of both Canada and the U.S.).

==Practical application==
In reality, radio propagation changes along with the weather and tropospheric ducting, and occasionally along with other upper-atmospheric phenomena like sunspots and even meteor showers. Thus, while a broadcasting authority might fix the range to an area with exact boundaries (defined as a series of vectors), this is rarely if ever true. When a broadcast reaches well outside of its intended range due to unusual conditions, DXing is possible.

The local terrain can also play a major role in limiting broadcast range. Mountain ranges block FM broadcasts, AM broadcasts, and TV broadcasts, and other signals in the VHF and especially UHF ranges, respectively. This terrain shielding occurs when the line of sight is blocked by something through which the radio waves cannot pass, particularly stone. At times this may be due to weather, such as when the tall cumulonimbus clouds of a squall line of thunderstorms reflect the signal over the top, like an extremely tall radio tower. Conversely, heavy rain may attenuate the range of even local stations. ATSC digital television is affected by wind and trees (even if not surrounding the transmitter or receiver locations), apparently related to its use of 8VSB modulation instead of COFDM.

AM broadcasting stations have different issues, due to using the mediumwave band. Broadcast range in these stations is determined by ground conductivity, and the proper use and maintenance of grounding radials which act as a ground plane for the mast radiators used. Skywaves reflect off the ionosphere at a much greater distance above Earth&#x27;s surface at night. This in turn causes mediumwave, most shortwave, and even longwave stations to travel much further at night, which is the side of the Earth where the solar wind pulls the ionosphere (and magnetosphere) away from the planet, instead of pushing toward it as on the day side. Because of this, many AM stations must cut power or go off-air at night, except for the very earliest stations still grandfathered on clear channels. Border blaster stations in northern Mexico also used this effect, along with very high-power transmitters, to extend their nighttime broadcast ranges well over the US/Mexico border and across most of the United States.

Various broadcast relay stations can help to extend a station&#x27;s area by retransmitting them on the same or another channel. What is usually called a repeater in amateur radio is called a broadcast translator (different channel) or booster (same channel) in American broadcasting, or the much broader category or rebroadcasters in Canadian broadcasting (which includes more than just the low-power broadcasting used in the U.S.) Boosters are used only within the broadcast range of the parent station, and serve the same function locally as regional and national single-frequency networks do in Europe. Distributed transmission has also undergone tests in the U.S., but to preserve stations&#x27; market share in their home media markets, these will be limited to the broadcast area of a single large station. Satellite radio, which is designed for use without a dish, also uses ground repeaters in large cities due to the many obstructions their high-rise buildings cause to the many current and potential customers that are concentrated there.

==Edge-of-range issues==
Those at the edge of a station&#x27;s broadcast range will typically notice static in an analog broadcast, while error correction will keep a digital signal clear until it hits the cliff effect and suddenly disappears completely. FM stations may flip back and forth (sometimes annoyingly rapidly when moving) due to the capture effect, while AM stations (including TV video) may overlay or fade with each other.

FM stereo will tend to get static more quickly than the monophonic sound due to its use of subcarriers, so stations may choose to extend the usable part of their range by disabling the stereo generator. Listeners can also choose to disable stereo decoding on the receiver, though loss of the stereo pilot tone causes this to happen automatically. Because this tends to turn on and off when at the threshold of reception, and the threshold is often set too low by the manufacturer&#x27;s product design, manually disabling this when at the edge of the broadcast range prevents the annoying noisy-stereo/quiet-mono switching.

The same is true of analog TV stereo and second audio programs, and even for color TV, all of which use subcarriers. Radio reading services and other subcarrier services will also tend to suffer from dropouts sooner than the main station.

Technologies are available that allow for switching to a different signal carrying the same radio program when leaving the broadcast range of a station. Radio Data System allows for switching to a different FM or station with the same identifier, or even to (but not necessarily from) an AM station. Satellite radio also is designed to switch seamlessly between repeaters and/or satellite when moving outside the range of one or the other. HD Radio switches back to the analog signal as a fallback when the edge of the digital range is encountered, but the success of this from the listener&#x27;s perspective depends on how well the station&#x27;s broadcast engineer has synchronized the two.

==Digital versus analog==
Digital transmissions require less power to be received clearly than analog ones. The exact figure for various modes depends on how robust the signal is made to begin with, such as modulation, guard interval, and forward error correction. In each of these three factors, the caveat is that a higher data signaling rate means a tradeoff with reduced broadcast range. The hierarchical modulation used on DVB is a unique case, which reduces the range of the full-definition signal, in exchange for an increase in the usable range of the lower-definition part of the video.

Digital stations in North America usually are operated by the same groups as the analog side, and thus operate their own independent facilities. Because of this, the FCC requires U.S. TV stations to replicate their analog coverage with their digital signal as well. However, ATSC digital TV only requires about one-fifth the amount of power to reach the same area on the same channel as analog does. For HD Radio, the figure is only one percent of the station&#x27;s analog wattage, in part because it is an in-band on-channel method, which uses sidebands that must prevent interference to adjacent channels, especially for older or cheaper receivers which have insufficient sensitivity and/or selectivity.

<doc id="229446" wikidata="Q4769937" url="?curid=229446" title="Anomalous propagation">
<text>Anomalous propagation (sometimes shortened to anaprop or anoprop) includes different forms of radio propagation due to an unusual distribution of temperature and humidity with height in the atmosphere. While this includes propagation with larger losses than in a standard atmosphere, in practical applications it is most often meant to refer to cases when signal propagates beyond normal radio horizon.

Anomalous propagation can cause interference to VHF and UHF radio communications if distant stations are using the same frequency as local services. Over-the-air analog television broadcasting, for example, may be disrupted by distant stations on the same channel, or experience distortion of transmitted signals ghosting). Radar systems may produce inaccurate ranges or bearings to distant targets if the radar &quot;beam&quot; is bent by propagation effects. However, radio hobbyists take advantage of these effects in TV and FM DX.

== Causes ==

=== Air temperature profile ===

The first assumption of the prediction of propagation of a radio wave is that it is moving through air with temperature that declines at a standard rate with height in the troposphere. This has the effect of slightly bending (refracting) the path toward the Earth, and accounts for an effective range that is slightly greater than the geometric distance to the horizon. Any variation to this stratification of temperatures will modify the path followed by the wave. Changes to the path can be separated into super and under refraction:

==== Super refraction ====
It is very common to have temperature inversions forming near the ground, for instance air cooling at night while remaining warm aloft. This happens equally aloft when a warm and dry airmass overrides a cooler one, like in the subsidence aloft cause by a high pressure intensifying. The index of refraction of air increases in both cases and the EM wave bends toward the ground instead of continuing upward.

On surface-base inversion, the beam will eventually hit the ground and a part of it can be reflected back toward the emitter. In upper air inversion, the bending will be limited to the layer involved but the bending will extend the path of the beam, possibly beyond the usual transmission horizon.

==== Atmospheric duct ====

When the inversion is very strong and shallow, the EM wave is trapped within the inversion layer. The beam will bounce many times inside the layer as within a waveguide. In surface-based ducting, the beam will hit the ground many times, causing return echoes at regular distances toward the emitter. In elevated ducts, the transmission can be extended to very large distances.

==== Sub refraction ====
On the other hand, if the air is unstable and cools faster than the standard atmosphere with height, the wave is higher than expected and can miss the intended receiver.
=== Other causes ===

Other ways anomalous propagation is recorded is by troposcatters causing irregularities in the troposphere, scattering due to meteors, refraction in the ionized regions and layers of the ionosphere, and reflection from the ionosphere.

Finally, multipath propagation near the Earth&#x27;s surface has multiple causes, including atmospheric ducting, ionospheric reflection and refraction, and reflection from water bodies and terrestrial objects such as mountains and buildings.

== In radio ==

Anomalous propagation can be a limiting factor for the propagation of radiowaves, especially the super refraction. However, reflection on the ionosphere is a common use of this phenomenon to extend the range of the signal. Other multiple reflections or refractions are more complex to predict but can be still useful.

== Radar ==

The position of the radar echoes depend heavily on the standard decrease of temperature hypothesis. However, the real atmosphere can vary greatly from the norm. Anomalous propagation refers to false radar echoes usually observed when calm, stable atmospheric conditions, often associated with super refraction in a temperature inversion, direct the radar beam toward the ground. The processing program will then wrongly place the return echoes at the height and distance it would have been in normal conditions.

This type of false return is relatively easy to spot on a time loop if it is due to night cooling or marine inversion as one sees very strong echoes developing over an area, spreading in size laterally, not moving but varying greatly in intensity with time. After sunrise, the inversion disappears gradually and the area diminishes correspondingly. Inversion of temperature exists too ahead of warm fronts, and around thunderstorms&#x27; cold pool. Since precipitation exists in those circumstances, the abnormal propagation echoes are then mixed with real rain and/or targets of interest, which make them more difficult to separate.

Anomalous propagation is different from ground clutter, ocean reflections (sea clutter), biological returns from birds and insects, debris, chaff, sand storms, volcanic eruption plumes, and other non-precipitation meteorological phenomena. Ground and sea clutters are permanent reflection from fixed areas on the surface with stable reflective characteristics. Biological scatterers gives weak echoes over a large surface. These can vary in size with time but not much in intensity. Debris and chaff are transient and move in height with time. They are all indicating something actually there and either relevant to the radar operator and/or readily explicable and theoretically able to be reproduced.

Doppler radars and Pulse-Doppler radars are extracting the velocities of the targets. Since anomalous propagation comes from stable targets, it is possible to subtract the reflectivity data having a null speed and clean the radar images. Ground, sea clutter and the energy spike from the sun setting can be distinguished the same way but not other artifacts. This method is used in most modern radars, including air traffic control and weather radars.

<text>The Armenian Apostolic Church () is the autocephalous national church of Armenia. Part of Oriental Orthodoxy, it is one of the most ancient Christian institutions. The Kingdom of Armenia was the first state in history to adopt Christianity as its official religion under the rule of King Tiridates III, of the Arsacid dynasty in the early 4th century.

According to tradition, the church originated in the missions of Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus (Jude) in the 1st century. St. Gregory the Illuminator was the first official primate of the church. It is sometimes referred to as the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church, Armenian Church or Armenian Gregorian Church.

The Armenian Apostolic Church should not be confused with the fully distinct Armenian Catholic Church, which is an Eastern Catholic Church in communion with the See of Rome.

== History ==
=== Origins ===


The Armenian Apostolic Church believes in apostolic succession through the apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus (Jude). According to tradition, the latter of the two apostles is said to have cured Abgar V of Edessa of leprosy with the Image of Edessa, leading to his conversion in AD 30. Thaddaeus was then commissioned by Abgar to proselytize throughout Armenia, where he converted King Sanatruk&#x27;s daughter, who was eventually martyred alongside Thaddeus when Sanatruk later fell into apostasy. After this, Bartholomew came to Armenia, bringing a portrait of the Virgin Mary, which he placed in a nunnery he founded over a former temple of Anahit. Bartholomew then converted the sister of Sanatruk, who once again martyred a female relative and the apostle who converted her. Both apostles ordained native bishops before their execution, and some other Armenians had been ordained outside of Armenia by James the Just. Scholars including Bart Ehrman, Han J.W. Drijvers, and Walter Bauer dismiss the conversion of Abgar V as fiction.

According to Eusebius and Tertullian, Armenian Christians were persecuted by kings Axidares, Khosrov I, and Tiridates III, the last of whom was converted to Christianity by Gregory the Illuminator. Ancient Armenia was the first state to adopt Christianity as a state religion, which has been referred to by Nina Garsoïan as &quot;probably the most crucial step in its history.&quot; This conversion distinguished it from its Iranian and Mazdean roots and protected it from further Parthian influence. According to Mary Boyce, the acceptance of Christianity by the Arsacid-Armenian rulers was partly in defiance of the Sassanids.

When King Tiridates III made Christianity the state religion of Armenia between 300 and 301, it was not an entirely new religion there. It had penetrated the country from at least the third century, and may have been present even earlier.

Tiridates declared Gregory to be the first &quot;Catholicos&quot; of the Armenian Apostolic Church and sent him to Caesarea to be consecrated. Upon his return, Gregory tore down shrines to idols, built churches and monasteries, and ordained many priests and bishops. While meditating in the old capital city of Vagharshapat, Gregory had a vision of Christ descending to the earth and striking it with a hammer. From that spot arose a great Christian temple with a huge cross. He was convinced that God intended him to build the main Armenian church there. With the king&#x27;s help he did so in accordance with his vision, renaming the city Etchmiadzin, which means &quot;the place of the descent of the Only-Begotten&quot;.

Initially, the Armenian Apostolic Church participated in the larger Christian world and was subordinated to the Bishop of Caesarea. Its Catholicos was represented at the First Council of Nicea (325). St. Vrtanes I, the third Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church (333–341), sent a letter with specific questions to Macarius, the Orthodox Bishop of Jerusalem (312-335/36), taken to Jerusalem by a delegation of Armenian priests on the occasion of the Encaenia, in dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in September 335. In Macarius&#x27;s letter to the Armenians in 335, it seeks to correct irregularities in the initiation rites of baptism and the eucharist in use in the Armenian Church by articulating the practices in Jerusalem. In so doing, it reveals the divergent forms being practiced in Armenia, which have strong echoes of old East Syriac Rite. Orthopraxy was conceived by Vrtanes and his Armenian colleagues in terms of liturgical performance in Jerusalem. In 353, King Papas (Pap) appointed Catholicos Husik without first sending him to Caesarea for commissioning. The Armenian Catholicos was still represented at the First Council of Constantinople (381).

As Gregory was consecrated by the bishop of Caesarea, he also accepted the Byzantine Rite. However, the Armenian Church, due to the influence of the Church in Edessa, the large presence of Syriacs in Armenia, as well as the number of Syriac priests that arrived in Armenia with Gregory, also cultivated the West Syriac or Antiochian Rite. Since Armenians at the time did not have an alphabet, its clergy learned Greek and Syriac. From this synthesis, the new Armenian Rite came about, which had similarities both with the Byzantine and the Antiochian Syriac rite.

Christianity was strengthened in Armenia in the 5th century by the translation of the Bible into the Armenian language by the native theologian, monk, and scholar, Saint Mesrop Mashtots. Before the 5th century, Armenians had a spoken language, but no script. Thus, the Bible and liturgy were written in the Greek or Syriac scripts until Catholicos Sahak Part&#x27;ew commissioned Mesrop to create the Armenian alphabet, which he completed in . Subsequently, the Bible and liturgy were translated into Armenian and written in the new script. The translation of the Bible, along with works of history, literature and philosophy, caused a flowering of Armenian literature and a broader cultural renaissance.

Although unable to attend the Council of Ephesus (431), Catholicos Isaac Parthiev (Sahak Part&#x27;ew) sent a message agreeing with its decisions. However, non-doctrinal elements in the Council of Chalcedon (451) caused certain problems to arise.

===Independence===

Miaphysitism spread from Syria to Armenia, from where it came to Georgia and Caucasian Albania.

At the First Council of Dvin in 506, the synod of the Armenian, Georgian, and Caucasian Albanian bishops was assembled during the time in office of Catholicos Babken I. The participation of the Catholicoi of Georgia and Albania was set to make clear the position of the churches concerning the Council of Chalcedon. The &quot;Book of Epistles&quot; mentions that 20 bishops, 14 laymen, and many nakharars (rulers of Armenia) participated in the council.

Almost a century later (609–610), the Third Council of Dvin was convened during the reign of Catholicos Abraham I of Aghbatank and Prince Smbat Bagratuni, with clergymen and laymen participating. The Georgian Church disagreed with the Armenian Church, having approved the christology of Chalcedon. This council was convened to clarify the relationship between the Armenian and Georgian churches. After the Council, Catholicos Abraham wrote an encyclical letter addressed to the people, blaming Catholicos Kurion of the Georgian Church and his adherents for the schism. The Council never set up canons; it only deprived Georgians from taking communion in the Armenian Church. Despite this, the Albanian Church remained under the jurisdiction of the Armenian Church while also in communion with the Georgian Church.

=== 20th century ===

In 1903, the Tsarist government of the Russian Empire moved to confiscate the property of the Armenian Church.

==Miaphysitism versus monophysitism==
Like all Oriental Orthodox churches, the Armenian Church has been referred to as monophysite by both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theologians because it rejected the decisions of the Council of Chalcedon, which condemned the belief of one incarnate nature of Christ (monophysis). The Armenian Church officially severed ties with Rome and Constantinople in 610, during the Third Council of Dvin where the Chalcedonian dyophysite christological formula was rejected.

However, again like other Oriental Orthodox, the Armenian Apostolic Church argues that the identification as &quot;monophysitism&quot; is an incorrect description of its position. It considers Monophysitism, as taught by Eutyches and condemned at Chalcedon, a heresy and disagrees with the formula defined by the Council of Chalcedon. The Armenian Church instead adheres to the doctrine defined by Cyril of Alexandria, considered as a saint by the Chalcedonian churches as well, who described Christ as being of one incarnate nature, where both divine and human nature are united (miaphysis). To distinguish this from Eutychian and other versions of Monophysitism this position is called miaphysitism. Whereas the prefix &quot;mono-&quot; (&lt; Greek μονο- &lt; μόνος) means &quot;single, alone, only&quot;, thus emphasising the singular nature of Christ, &quot;mia&quot; (μία &quot;one&quot; ), simply means &quot;one&quot; unemphatically, and allows for a compound nature.

In recent times, both Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian churches have developed a deeper understanding for each other&#x27;s positions, recognizing their substantial agreement while maintaining their respective positions.

==Structure and leadership==
According to &quot;The Armenian Church&quot; by Archdeacon Dowling published in 1910 (before the Great War and the Armenian Genocide), the Armenian Apostolic Church was composed of four patriarchal provinces, comprising at that date seventy-two, six, and two dioceses in Turkey, Russia, and Iran, respectively.

===Two catholicosates===
The Armenian Apostolic Church currently has two sees. First, there is the Catholicos of All Armenians residing in Etchmiadzin, Armenia, at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. Second, there is the Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia, headquartered since 1930 in Antelias, Lebanon. The Catholicos of Etchmiadzin has pre-eminent supremacy in all spiritual matters over the See of Cilicia, which however administers to the dioceses under its jurisdiction as they see fit.

The Armenian Catholic Church is completely distinct from the Armenian Apostolic Church and is headed by its own Patriarch-Catholicos.

===Two patriarchates===
The Armenian Apostolic Church has two patriarchates of high authority, both under the jurisdiction of the Catholicos of All Armenians:

*The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem (), whose seat is in the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem. It is headed since 2013 by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Archbishop Nourhan Manougian.
*The Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople () and All of Turkey, which has jurisdiction in the modern-day Republic of Turkey. Its seat is in Istanbul, Turkey and is headed since 2019 by the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Archbishop Sahak II Mashalian.

==Women in the Armenian Church==
The Armenian Church does not ordain women to the priesthood. Historically, however, monastic women have been ordained as deacons within a convent environment. When ordained to the diaconate, &quot;men and women are ordained to the diaconate using the same rite, with both having functions of chanting the Gospel and serving in the Divine Liturgy.&quot; Monastic women deacons generally do not minister in traditional parish churches or cathedrals, although the late Sister Hripseme did minister and serve during public liturgies, including in the United States. The Armenian Church&#x27;s last monastic deaconess was Sister Hripsime Sasounian (died in 2007) and on 25 September 2017, Ani-Kristi Manvelian, a twenty-four-year-old woman, was ordained in Tehran&#x27;s St. Sarkis Mother Church as the first parish deaconess after many centuries. 

Women also serve as altar girls and lay readers, especially when a parish is so small that not enough boys or men are regularly available to serve. Women commonly serve the church in the choir and at the organ, on parish councils, as volunteers for church events, fundraisers, and Sunday schools, as supporters through Women&#x27;s Guilds, and as staff members in church offices. In the case of a married priest (Der Hayr), the wife of the priest generally plays an active role in the parish and is addressed by the title Yeretzgin.

In limited circumstances, the Armenian Church allows for divorce and remarriage. Cases usually include either adultery or apostasy.

==Armenian genocide victims canonization==
On April 23, 2015, the Armenian Apostolic Church canonized all the victims of the Armenian genocide; this service is believed to be the largest canonization service in history. 1.5 million is the most frequently published number of victims, however, estimates vary from 700,000 to 1,800,000. It was the first canonization by the Armenian Apostolic Church in four hundred years.

== Army Chaplaincy Program ==
The Army Chaplaincy Program of the Armenian Church is made up of more than 50 clergymen serving as military chaplains to the Armed Forces of Armenia. They organize various religious programs in the military, including delivering lectures and prayers. It is jointly funded and sponsored by the Ministry of Defence of Armenia and the Armenian Apostolic Church. All army chaplains are commissioned officers in the armed forces who hold a military rank. It was established in 1997 on the basis of a joint initiative of Catholicos Karekin I and Defense minister Vazgen Sargsyan. Since 2011, combined clergy company has taken part in the quinquennial Armenian Independence Day Parade on Republic Square in Yerevan.

==Current state==
=== In Armenia ===

The status of the Armenian Apostolic Church within Armenia is defined in the country&#x27;s constitution. Article 8.1 of the Constitution of Armenia states: &quot;The Republic of Armenia recognizes the exclusive historical mission of the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church as a national church, in the spiritual life, development of the national culture and preservation of the national identity of the people of Armenia.&quot; Among others, ethnographer Hranush Kharatyan has questioned the constitutionality of the phrase &quot;national church&quot;.

In 2009, further constitutional amendments were drafted that would make it a crime for non-traditional religious groups to proselytize on adherents of the Apostolic Church. Minority groups would also be banned from spreading &#x27;distrust&#x27; in other faiths. Hrant Bagratyan, former Prime Minister of Armenia, condemned the close association of the Armenian Apostolic Church with the Armenian government, calling the Church an &quot;untouchable&quot; organisation that is secretive of its income and expenditure.

=== In Artsakh ===
After the Bolshevik revolution and the subsequent Soviet occupation of Armenia, all functioning religious institutions in the NKAO were closed down and clergymen often either exiled or shot.

After a while the Armenian Apostolic Church resumed its activities. There were weddings, baptisms, and every Sunday Patarag at a free will attendance basis. The Armenian Apostolic Church since 1989 restored or constructed more than 30 churches worldwide. In 2009 the Republic of Artsakh government introduced a law entitled &quot;Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organisations&quot;, article 8 of which provided that only the Armenian Apostolic Church is allowed to preach on the territory of the Republic of Artsakh. However, the law did make processes available for other religious institutions to get approval from the government if they wished to worship within the Republic.

=== Armenian diaspora ===

Outside of West Asia, today there are notable Armenian Apostolic congregations in various countries.

In 2024, the church had 600,000 members in North America and 10,000 members in South America; they also had 25,000 members in Europe.

Lebanon, home to a large and influential Armenian diaspora community with its own political parties, has more than 17 recognized Armenian Apostolic churches.

The Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople in Turkey and the Armenian Apostolic Church of Iran are important communities in the diaspora. These churches represent the largest Christian ethnic minorities in these predominantly Muslim countries.

The United Kingdom has three Armenian churches: St Sarkis in Kensington, London; Saint Yeghiche in South Kensington, London; and Holy Trinity in Manchester.

Ethiopia has had an Armenian church since the 1920s, when groups of Armenians were invited there after the Armenian genocide by Turkey; however, membership numbers are low in the early 2020s.

==Historical role and public image==
The Armenian Apostolic Church is &quot;seen by many as the custodian of Armenian national identity.&quot; &quot;Beyond its role as a religious institution, the Apostolic Church has traditionally been seen as the foundational core in the development of the Armenian national identity as God&#x27;s uniquely chosen people.&quot; According to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center, in Armenia 82% of respondents say it is very or somewhat important to be a Christian to be truly Armenian.

According to a 2015 survey 79% of people in Armenia trust it, while 12% neither trust it nor distrust it, and 8% distrust the church.

As both Eastern and Western Armenia came under Persian and Ottoman rule, the Armenian Apostolic Church was the centre of many Armenian liberation activities.

==Controversies and criticisms==
=== Medieval era ===
Early medieval opponents of the Armenian Church in Armenia included the Paulicians (7th-9th centuries) and the Tondrakians (9th-11th centuries).

The power relationship between Catholic and secular rulers was sometimes a source of conflict. In 1037 king Hovhannes-Smbat of Ani deposed and imprisoned Catholicos Petros, who he suspected of holding pro-Byzantine views, and appointed a replacement catholicos. This persecution was highly criticized by the Armenian clergy, forcing Hovhannes-Smbat to release Petros and reinstall him to his former position. In 1038 a major ecclesiastical council was held in Ani, which denied the king the right to elect or remove a catholicos.

Architecture historian Samvel Karapetyan (1961-2016) has criticized many aspects of the Armenian Apostolic Church, especially its role in Armenian history. Karapetyan particularly denounced what he called the Armenian Church&#x27;s loyal service to foreign invaders: &quot;The Armenian Apostolic Church is a conscientious tax structure, which every conqueror needs.&quot;

===Modern era===
Gerard Libaridian argued that because Armenians consider the church a national institution, it &quot;must be respected and guarded at all times. Therefore the critical attitude regarding Armenian historical institutions is rarely applied to the Armenian Church, as it is seen as a venerable institution that unites all Armenians.&quot; Stepan Danielyan, a scholar on religion, argued in 2013 that &quot;When Armenia became independent with the collapse of the Soviet Union, a great deal was expected of the church, but those expectations have not been fulfilled. The church continues to ignore the things most people are worried about – vitally important social, economic and political problems and endless corruption scandals.&quot;

In independent Armenia, the Armenian Apostolic Church has often been criticized for its perceived support of the governments of Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan despite the formal separation of church and state in Armenia. According to former Prime Minister Hrant Bagratyan religion and state management &quot;have completely gotten mixed up&quot;. He described the church as an &quot;untouchable&quot; organization that is secretive of its income and expenditure. Large-scale construction of new churches in the independence period and the negligence of endangered historic churches by the Apostolic church (and the government) have also been criticized.

In recent years, a few high-profile leaders of the church have been involved in controversies. In 2013 Navasard Ktchoyan, the Archbishop of the Araratian Diocese and Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan were alleged to have been partners with a businessman charged with laundering US$10.7 million bank loan and then depositing most of it in accounts he controlled in Cyprus. In 2011 it was revealed that Ktchoyan drives a Bentley (valued at $180,000-$280,000). Pointing out the 34% poverty rate in Armenia, &quot;Asbarez&quot; editor Ara Khachatourian called it &quot;nothing but blasphemy&quot;. He added &quot;Archbishop Kchoyan&#x27;s reckless disregard and attitude is even more unacceptable due to his position in the Armenian Church.&quot;

In October 2013 Father Asoghik Karapetyan, the director of the Museum of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, stated on television that a non-Apostolic Armenian is not a &quot;true Armenian&quot;. A spokesperson for the Armenian Apostolic Church stated that it is his personal view. The statement received considerable criticism, though Asoghik did not retract his statement. In an editorial in the liberal &quot;Aravot&quot; daily Aram Abrahamyan suggested that religious identity should not be equated with national (ethnic) identity and it is up to every individual to decide whether they are Armenian or not, regardless of religion.

<doc id="229449" wikidata="Q327264" url="?curid=229449" title="William Ponsonby (British Army officer)">
<text>Major-General Sir William Ponsonby (13 October 177218 June 1815) was a British Army officer and politician who served in the Napoleonic Wars and was killed at the Battle of Waterloo.

==Early life and education==
He was the second son of William Ponsonby, who was created Baron Ponsonby of Imokilly in 1806, and Hon. Louisa Molesworth. He was the grandson of politician Hon. John Ponsonby and great-grandson of the 3rd Duke of Devonshire and the 1st Earl of Bessborough. Educated at Kilkenny and Eton, he married Hon. Georgiana FitzRoy, youngest daughter of Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton.
Together they had five children:

*Hon. Anne Louisa (d. 23 Jan 1863), who married William Tighe Hamilton and together had at least one son, Frederick FitzRoy Hamilton.
*Hon. Charlotte Georgiana (d. 7 Sep 1883), who married firstly Lt.-Col. John Horace Thomas Stapleton, son of Lt.-Gen. William Stapleton and Anna Maria Keppel (daughter of the Bishop of Exeter, Frederick Keppel), and had no issue. Secondly Rear-Adm. Sir Charles Talbot, son of Rev. Charles Talbot. They had seven children.
*Mary Elizabeth (d. 14 Sep 1838), who married Rev. Henry George Talbot, brother of her sister&#x27;s husband, Charles. They had one son, Maj. Henry Charles Talbot. 
*Frances Isabella (d. 1845), who married Rev. Hyde Wyndham Beadon, son of Rt. Rev. Richard Beadon and Annabella à Court, daughter of Sir William à Court, 1st Baronet. They had five children.
*Lord William (6 Feb 1816 – 2 Oct 1861), married Maria Theresa Duerbeck but died without issue.

==Political career==
Between 1796 and 1798, Ponsonby sat as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the Irish House of Commons for the Tories and represented Bandonbridge. Subsequently, he stood for Fethard (County Tipperary) and held this seat until the Act of Union in 1801. He entered the British House of Commons in 1812, sitting for Londonderry until his death. In 1815, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB).

==Peninsular War==
When Ponsonby&#x27;s command, the 5th Dragoon Guards, arrived in the Peninsula in October 1811, it became part of John Le Marchant&#x27;s heavy cavalry brigade. For the rest of the war, this brigade included the 5th Dragoon Guards and the 3rd and 4th Dragoons. Ponsonby took part in Le Marchant&#x27;s famous charge at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812. On that occasion, the British heavy dragoons rode down one French infantry division and part of a second before being repulsed. Upon Le Marchant&#x27;s death in the battle, Ponsonby took over the brigade, participating in the campaign that included the Siege of Burgos. In 1813, Ponsonby led his 1,200-strong cavalry brigade at the Battle of Vitoria. During the Battle of the Pyrenees and the autumn campaigns in the mountains, the Duke of Wellington sent the bulk of his cavalry to the rear. On 25 January 1814, Ponsonby took leave of his brigade and in the final battles in France, Lord Charles Manners exercised command.

==Battle of Waterloo==
Ponsonby&#x27;s part in the Battle of Waterloo is remembered because it highlights some pertinent points about cavalry charging. Ponsonby was in command of the Union Brigade, so-called because it included an English, a Scottish and an Irish regiment. The brigade consisted of the 1st &quot;Royal&quot; and 6th &quot;Inniskilling&quot; Regiments of Dragoons in the first line and the 2nd &quot;Royal North British&quot; Dragoons (Scots Greys) in reserve. It had counter-attacked to great effect against the disorganised French columns of d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s I Corps. Carried away by their initial success, however, the brigade failed to rally and continued towards the French positions. The Scots Greys in particular, forgetting their supporting role and ignoring the &quot;recall&quot;, charged on in disordered groups, some of whom reached the French guns on the other side of the valley. By this time their horses were exhausted and a swift retribution followed in the form of a counter-attack by the French lancers. The brigade suffered very heavy losses (see table below) and played no further part in the battle. Ponsonby, who was mounted on a horse of less value than the best one in his stable, rode too far and with his horse mired in mud close to enemy lines, was set upon by French Lancers. Recognising his rank and worth as a prisoner, the French gestured to him, urging him to surrender. He failed to understand them, and, when a group of his own Union Brigade spotted him and rode to his rescue, the lancers from one of the French line regiments (either the 3rd Lancers or 4th Lancers) attached to d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s I Corps had no option but to kill him. Myths growing up after the battle turned this into a guardsman from the &quot;Red Lancers&quot;, which included the surviving squadron of the Polish lancers of the Guard. Following Ponsonby&#x27;s death, command of the Union Brigade devolved upon Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Clifton of the 1st Royal Dragoons.

==Memorials==
Ponsonby has a large marble monument at the west end of the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. It was designed by Edward Hodges Baily in 1815.

==Other==
In the 1970 film &quot;Waterloo,&quot; Ponsonby was played by Michael Wilding.

<text>Blanketing is a term used predominantly in the US to refer to receiver blocking, which is interference caused when a strong unwanted off-channel radio signal prevents the reception of another (wanted) transmission.

This problem is greatly reduced by even moderate-quality receivers, which have better selectivity (filtering) and dynamic range than poorly designed inexpensive or disposable ones.

<doc id="229454" wikidata="Q5137431" url="?curid=229454" title="Co-channel interference">
<text>Co-channel interference or CCI is crosstalk from two different radio transmitters using the same channel. Co-channel interference can be caused by many factors from weather conditions to administrative and design issues. Co-channel interference may be controlled by various radio resource management schemes.

== Cellular mobile networks ==
In cellular mobile communication (GSM &amp; LTE Systems, for instance), frequency spectrum is a precious resource which is divided into non-overlapping spectrum bands which are assigned to different cells (In cellular communications, a cell refers to the hexagonal/circular area around the base station antenna). However, after certain geographical distance, these frequency bands are re-used, i.e. the same spectrum bands are reassigned to other distant cells. The co-channel interference arises in the cellular mobile networks owing to this phenomenon of frequency reuse. Thus, besides the intended signal from within the cell, signals at the same frequencies (co-channel signals) arrive at the receiver from the undesired transmitters located (far away) in some other cells and lead to deterioration in receiver performance.

== Adverse weather conditions ==
For FM, vertical layering of moisture content and temperature in the atmosphere (inversion layers) can occasionally cause signals to travel hundreds or thousands of kilometres further than usual. An inversion layer (or duct) is most commonly observed over high pressure regions and may affect radio signals for several hours to several days. The phenomenon is commonly referred to as anomalous propagation and is more likely in hot, dry weather in late summer.

== Poor frequency planning ==
Poor planning of frequencies by broadcasters can cause CCI, although this is rare. A very localised example is Listowel in the south-west of Ireland. The 2RN UHF television transmitter systems in Listowel and Knockmoyle (near Tralee) are on the same frequencies but with opposite polarisation. However, in some outskirts of Listowel town, both transmitters can be picked up causing heavy CCI. This problem forces residents in these areas to use alternative transmitters to receive RTÉ programming.

== Overly-crowded radio spectrum ==

In many populated areas, there just isn&#x27;t much room in the radio spectrum. Stations will be jam-packed in, sometimes to the point that one can hear loud and clear two, three, or more stations on the same frequency, at once. In the USA, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) propagation models used to space stations on the same frequency are not always accurate in prediction of signals and interference. An example of this situation is in some parts of Fayetteville, Arkansas the local 99.5 FM KAKS is displaced by KXBL 99.5 FM in Tulsa, Oklahoma particularly on the west side of significant hills. Another example would be of Ashtabula&#x27;s WKKY 104.7 having interference from Toledo&#x27;s WIOT 104.7 FM on the Ontario shore of Lake Erie, as well as Woodstock&#x27;s CIHR-FM (on rare occasions), which is also on 104.7 FM, due to the signals traveling very far across Lake Erie. The interference to WIOT from the operation of W284BQ, translator, has been resolved by the FCC. Effective October 18, 2011, it must cease operation.

== Daytime vs nighttime ==
In the medium frequency portion of the radio spectrum where most AM broadcasting is allocated, signals propagate full-time via groundwave and, at nighttime, via skywave as well. This means that during the nighttime hours, co-channel interference exists on many AM radio frequencies due to the medium waves reflecting off the ionosphere and being bounced back down to earth. In the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Bahamas, there are international agreements on certain frequencies which allocate &quot;clear-channel&quot; broadcasting for certain stations to either have their respective frequencies to themselves at night, or to share their respective frequencies with other stations located over hundreds or even thousands of miles away. On other frequencies, there are &quot;Regional Channels&quot; where most stations on these frequencies either reduce power or change to a directional antenna system at nighttime to help reduce co-channel interference to each other&#x27;s signals. In the United States, there are six &quot;Local Channel&quot; frequencies, also known as &quot;graveyarders&quot; where nearly every station on those frequencies has the same power and antenna pattern both day and night and, as a result of skywave propagation, there is normally massive co-channel interference in rural areas on these frequencies, often making it difficult, if not impossible, to understand what&#x27;s being said on the nearest local station on the respective channel, or the other distant stations which are bouncing on the same channel, during the nighttime hours. Skywave has been used for long distance AM radio reception since radio&#x27;s inception and should not be construed as a negative aspect of AM radio. FCC deregulation allowed many new AM radio stations on the former clear and regional channel designations; this is the principal cause of overcrowding on the AM band at night. A new source of interference on the AM broadcast band is the new digital broadcast system called HD, any AM station that broadcasts HD superimposes digital &quot;hash&quot; on its adjacent channels. This is especially apparent at night as some stations, for example WBZ transmits its 30 kHz wide signal for hundreds of miles at night causing documented interference and covering another station on an adjoining frequency (WYSL 1040) as far as 400 miles away.

== Cancellation of signal ==
In addition, many AM stations, including but not limited to the clear channel-stations, often experience cancellation of their own signals within the inner and outer fringes of their normal groundwave coverage areas at nighttime due to the stations&#x27; individual skywave signals reaching the listeners&#x27; receivers at or near equal strength to the stations&#x27; individual groundwave signals; this phenomenon is very similar to the multipath interference experienced on FM Radio in the VHF band within mountainous regions and urban areas due to signals bouncing off of mountains, buildings, and other structures, except that the groundwave-skywave cancellation occurs almost exclusively at nighttime when skywave propagation is present.

== Bleeding of adjacent bands ==

Even with frequency planning, bleeding of signals from adjacent bands can lead to interference. This can impair passive remote sensing used for environmental monitoring, such as by weather satellites. The advent of 5G may significantly increase deleterious effects on satellites which would impair numerical weather prediction performance, resulting in substantially adverse economic and public safety impacts. Due to such concerns, US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine in February 2019 urged the FCC to cancel proposed spectrum bidding, which this was rejected. Unlicensed operations or poorly regulated bands also can lead to interference.

<text>Operation Reinhard or Operation Reinhardt ( or ; also or ) was the codename of the secret German plan in World War II to exterminate Polish Jews in the General Government district of German-occupied Poland. This deadliest phase of the Holocaust was marked by the introduction of extermination camps. The operation proceeded from March 1942 to November 1943; about 1.47 million or more Jews were murdered in just 100 days from late July to early November 1942, a rate which is approximately 83% higher than the commonly suggested figure for the kill rate in the Rwandan genocide. In the time frame of July to October 1942, the overall death toll, including all killings of Jews and not just Operation Reinhard, amounted to two million killed in those four months alone. It was the single fastest rate of genocidal killing in history.

During the operation, as many as two million Jews were sent to Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka to be murdered in purpose-built gas chambers. In addition, facilities for mass-murder using Zyklon B were developed at about the same time at the Majdanek concentration camp and at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, near the earlier-established Auschwitz I camp.

==Background==
After the German–Soviet war began, the Nazis undertook their European-wide &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;. In January 1942, during a secret meeting of German leaders chaired by Reinhard Heydrich, Operation Reinhard was drafted; it was soon to become a significant step in the systematic murder of the Jews in occupied Europe, beginning in the General Government district of German-occupied Poland. Within months, three top-secret camps (at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka) were built to efficiently murder tens of thousands of Jews every day.

These camps differed from Auschwitz and Majdanek, which initially operated as forced-labour camps before facilities for mass death were installed (gas chambers, crematoria etc.) Even after becoming death camps fitted with crematoria, &quot;konzentrationslager&quot; like Auschwitz remained largely dedicated to forced labor. Unlike &quot;mixed&quot; extermination camps, the extermination camps of Operation Reinhard kept no prisoners, except as needed to advance the camp&#x27;s industrial-scale murder. Very few Jews escaped death (notably, only two at Bełżec). All other victims were murdered on arrival.

The organizational apparatus behind the new extermination plan had been put to the test already during the &quot;euthanasia&quot; &quot;Aktion&quot; T4 programme ending in August 1941, during which more than 70,000 Polish and German disabled men, women, and children were murdered. The &quot;SS&quot; officers responsible for the &quot;Aktion&quot; T4, including Christian Wirth, Franz Stangl, and Irmfried Eberl, were all given key roles in the implementation of the &quot;Final Solution&quot; in 1942.

==Operational name==
The origin of the operation&#x27;s name is debated by Holocaust researchers. Various German documents spell the name differently, some with &quot;t&quot; after &quot;d&quot; (as in &quot;Aktion Reinhardt&quot;), others without it. Yet another spelling (&quot;Einsatz Reinhart&quot;) was used in the Höfle Telegram. It is generally believed that &quot;Aktion Reinhardt&quot;, outlined at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, was named after Reinhard Heydrich, the coordinator of the so-called Final Solution of the Jewish Question, which entailed the extermination of the Jews living in the European countries occupied by Nazi Germany. Heydrich was attacked by British-trained Czechoslovakian agents on 27 May 1942 and died of his injuries eight days later. The earliest memo spelling out &quot;Einsatz Reinhard&quot; was relayed two months later.

==Death camps==
On 13 October 1941, SS and Police Leader Odilo Globočnik headquartered in Lublin received an oral order from Himmleranticipating the fall of Moscowto begin the construction of the first extermination camp at Bełżec in the General Government territory of occupied Poland. The order preceded the Wannsee Conference by three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;M/MPwB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The new camp was operational from 17 March 1942, with leadership brought in from Germany under the guise of Organisation Todt (OT).

Globočnik was given control over the entire programme. All the secret orders he received came directly from Himmler and not from &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Richard Glücks, head of the greater Nazi concentration camp system, which was run by the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; and engaged in slave labour for the war effort. Each death camp was managed by between 20 and 35 officers from the &quot;Totenkopfverbände&quot; (Death&#x27;s Head Units) sworn to absolute secrecy, and augmented by the &quot;Aktion&quot; T4 personnel selected by Globočnik. The extermination program was designed by them based on prior experience from the forced euthanasia centres. The bulk of the actual labour at each &quot;final solution&quot; camp was performed by up to 100 mostly Ukrainian Trawniki guards, recruited by &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Karl Streibel from among the Soviet prisoners of war, and by up to a thousand &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; prisoners whom the Trawniki guards used to terrorise. The &quot;SS&quot; called their volunteer guards &quot;Hiwis&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;Hilfswillige&quot; (lit. &quot;willing to help&quot;). According to the testimony of &quot;SS-Oberführer&quot; Arpad Wigand during his 1981 war crimes trial in Hamburg, only 25 percent of recruited collaborators could speak German.

By mid-1942, two more death camps had been built on Polish lands: Sobibór (operational by May 1942) under the leadership of &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Franz Stangl, and Treblinka (operational by July 1942) under &quot;SS-Obersturmführer&quot; Irmfried Eberl.
The &quot;SS&quot; pumped exhaust fumes from a large internal-combustion engines through long pipes into sealed rooms, murdering the people inside by carbon monoxide poisoning. Beginning in February–March 1943, the bodies of the dead were exhumed and cremated in pits. Treblinka, the last camp to become operational, used knowledge learned by the &quot;SS&quot; previously. With two powerful engines, run by &quot;SS-Scharführer&quot; Erich Fuchs, and the gas chambers soon rebuilt of bricks and mortar, this death factory had murdered between 800,000 and 1,200,000 people within 15 months, disposed of their bodies, and sorted their belongings for shipment to Germany.

The techniques used to deceive victims and the camps&#x27; overall layout were based on a pilot project of mobile killing conducted at the Chełmno extermination camp (&quot;Kulmhof&quot;), which entered operation in late 1941 and used gas vans. Chełmno was not a part of Reinhard. It came under the direct control of &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Ernst Damzog, commander of the SD in &quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot;. It was set up around a manor house similar to Sonnenstein. The use of gas vans had been previously tried and tested in the mass murder of Polish prisoners at Soldau, and in the extermination of Jews on the Russian Front by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. Between early December 1941 and mid-April 1943, 160,000 Jews were sent to Chełmno from the General Government via the Ghetto in Łódź. Chełmno did not have crematoria; only the mass graves in the woods. It was a testing ground for the establishment of faster methods of murdering and incinerating people, marked by the construction of stationary facilities for the mass murder a few months later. The Reinhard death camps adapted progressively as each new site was built.

Taken as a whole, Globočnik&#x27;s camps at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka had almost identical design, including staff members transferring between locations. The camps were situated within wooded areas well away from population centres. All were constructed near branch lines that linked to the &quot;Ostbahn&quot;. Each camp had an unloading ramp at a fake railway station, as well as a reception area that contained undressing barracks, barber shops, and money depositories. Beyond the receiving zone, at each camp was a narrow, camouflaged path known as the &quot;Road to Heaven&quot; (called &quot;Himmelfahrtsstraße&quot; or &quot;der Schlauch&quot; by the &quot;SS&quot;), which led to the extermination zone consisting of gas chambers, and the burial pits, up to deep, later replaced by cremation pyres with rails laid across the pits on concrete blocks; refuelled continuously by the &quot;Totenjuden&quot;. Both Treblinka and Bełżec were equipped with powerful crawler excavators from Polish construction sites in the vicinity, capable of most digging tasks without disrupting surfaces. At each camp, the &quot;SS&quot; guards and Ukrainian Trawnikis lived in a separate area from the Jewish work units. Wooden watchtowers and barbed-wire fences camouflaged with pine branches surrounded all camps.

The killing centres had no electric fences, as the size of the prisoner &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; (work units) remained comparatively easy to controlunlike in camps such as Dachau and Auschwitz. To assist with the arriving transports only specialised squads were kept alive, removing and disposing of bodies, and sorting property and valuables from the dead victims. The &quot;Totenjuden&quot; forced to work inside death zones were deliberately isolated from those who worked in the reception and sorting area. Periodically, those who worked in the death zones would be killed and replaced with new arrivals to remove any potential witnesses to the scale of the mass murder.

During &quot;Operation Reinhard&quot;, Globočnik oversaw the systematic murder of more than 2,000,000 Jews from Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, the Reich (Germany and Austria), the Netherlands, Greece, Hungary, Italy and the Soviet Union. An undetermined number of Roma were also murdered in these death camps, many of them children.

===Extermination process===
To achieve their intended purpose, all death camps used subterfuge and misdirection to conceal the truth and trick their victims into cooperation. This element had been developed in &quot;Aktion&quot; T4, when disabled and handicapped people were taken away for &quot;special treatment&quot; by the &quot;SS&quot; from &quot;Gekrat&quot; wearing white laboratory coats, thus giving the process an air of medical authenticity. After supposedly being assessed, the unsuspecting T4 patients were transported to killing centres. The same euphemism &quot;special treatment&quot; (&quot;Sonderbehandlung&quot;) was used in the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning/Matthäus&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;SS&quot; used a variety of ruses to move thousands of new arrivals travelling in Holocaust trains to the disguised killing sites without panic. Mass deportations were called &quot;resettlement actions&quot;; they were organised by special Commissioners and conducted by uniformed police battalions from Orpo and Schupo in an atmosphere of terror. Usually, the deception was absolute; in August 1942, people of the Warsaw Ghetto lined up for several days to be &quot;deported&quot; to obtain bread allocated for travel. Jews unable to move or attempting to flee were shot on the spot. Even though death in the cattle cars from suffocation and thirst was rampant, affecting up to 20 percent of trainloads, most victims were willing to believe that the German intentions were different. Once alighted, the prisoners were ordered to leave their luggage behind and march directly to the &quot;cleaning area&quot; where they were asked to hand over their valuables for &quot;safekeeping&quot;. Common tricks included the presence of a railway station with awaiting &quot;medical personnel&quot; and signs directing people to disinfection facilities. Treblinka also had a booking office with boards naming the connections for other camps further east.

The Jews most apprehensive of danger were brutally beaten to speed up the process. At times, the new arrivals who had suitable skills were selected to join the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;. Once in the changing area, the men and boys were separated from the women and children and everyone was ordered to disrobe for a communal bath: &quot;quicklythey were toldor the water will get cold&quot;. The old and sick, or slow, prisoners were taken to a fake infirmary named the &quot;Lazarett&quot;, that had a large mass grave behind it. They were killed by a bullet in the neck, while the rest were being forced into the gas chambers.
To drive the naked people into the execution barracks housing the gas chambers, the guards used whips, clubs, and rifle butts. Panic was instrumental in filling the gas chambers because the need to evade blows on their naked bodies forced the victims rapidly forward. Once packed tightly inside (to minimize available air), the steel air-tight doors with portholes were closed. The doors, according to Treblinka Museum research, originated from the Soviet military bunkers around Białystok. Although other methods of extermination, such as the cyanic poison Zyklon B, were already in use at other Nazi killing centres such as Auschwitz, the &quot;Aktion Reinhard&quot; camps used lethal exhaust gases from captured Soviet tank engines. Fumes would be discharged directly into the gas chambers for a given period, then the engines would be switched off. &quot;SS&quot; guards would determine when to reopen the gas doors based on how long it took for the screaming to stop from within (usually 25 to 30 minutes). Special teams of camp inmates (&quot;Sonderkommando&quot;) would then remove the corpses on flatbed carts. Before the corpses were thrown into grave pits, gold teeth were removed from mouths, and orifices were searched for jewellery, currency, and other valuables. All acquired goods were managed by the &quot;SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt&quot; (Main &quot;SS&quot; Economic and Administrative Department).

During the early phases of &quot;Operation Reinhard&quot;, bodies were simply thrown into mass graves and covered with lime. From 1943, to hide the evidence of the crime, the victims&#x27; remains were burned in open air pits. Special &quot;Leichenkommando&quot; (corpse units) had to exhume bodies from the mass graves around these death camps for incineration. &quot;Reinhard&quot; still left a paper trail; in January 1943, Bletchley Park intercepted an SS telegram by &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Hermann Höfle, Globočnik&#x27;s deputy in Lublin, to &quot;SS-Obersturmbannführer&quot; Adolf Eichmann in Berlin. The decoded Enigma message contained statistics showing a total of 1,274,166 arrivals at the four &quot;Aktion Reinhard&quot; camps until the end of 1942 but the British code-breakers did not understand the meaning of the message, which amounted to material evidence of how many people the Germans had murdered.

===Camp commandants===
==Temporary substitution policy==
In the winter of 1941, before the Wannsee Conference but after the commencement of Operation Barbarossa, the Nazis&#x27; need for forced labor greatly intensified. Himmler and Heydrich approved a Jewish substitution policy in Upper Silesia and in Galicia under the &quot;extermination through labour&quot; doctrine. Many Poles had already been sent to the Reich, creating a labour shortage in the General Government. Around March 1942, while the first extermination camp (Bełżec) began gassing, the deportation trains arriving in the Lublin reservation from Germany and Slovakia were searched for the Jewish skilled workers. After selection, they were delivered to Majdan Tatarski instead of for &quot;special treatment&quot; at Bełżec. For a short time, these Jewish laborers were temporarily spared death, while their families and all others were murdered. Some were relegated to work at a nearby airplane factory or as forced labor in the &quot;SS&quot;-controlled &quot;Strafkompanies&quot; and other work camps. Hermann Höfle was one of the chief supporters and implementers of this policy. There were problems with food supplies and the ensuing logistical challenges. Globočnik and Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger complained and the mass transfer was stopped even before the three extermination camps were operational.

==Disposition of the property of the victims==

Approximately 178 million German Reichsmarks&#x27; worth of Jewish property (equivalent to  million euros) was taken from the victims, with vast transfers of gold and valuables to the Reichsbank&#x27;s &quot;Melmer&quot; account, Gold Pool, and monetary reserve. Not only the German authorities were in receipt of Jewish property, because corruption was rife within the death camps. Many of the individual &quot;SS&quot; members and policemen involved in the murders took cash, property, and valuables for themselves. The higher-ranking &quot;SS&quot; men stole on an enormous scale. It was a common practice among the top echelon. Two Majdanek commandants, Karl-Otto Koch and Hermann Florstedt, were tried by the &quot;SS&quot; for it in April 1945. &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Georg Konrad Morgen, an &quot;SS&quot; judge from the &quot;SS&quot; Courts Office, prosecuted so many Nazi officers for individual violations that Himmler personally ordered him to restrain his cases by April 1944.

==Aftermath and cover up==

Operation Reinhard ended in November 1943. Most of the staff and guards were then sent to northern Italy for further &quot;Aktion&quot; against Jews and local partisans. Globočnik went to the San Sabba concentration camp, where he supervised the detention, torture and murder of political prisoners. To cover up the mass murder of more than two million people in Poland during Operation Reinhard, the Nazis implemented the secret &quot;Sonderaktion 1005&quot;, also called &quot;Aktion 1005&quot; or &quot; Enterdungsaktion&quot; (&quot;exhumation action&quot;). The operation, which began in 1942 and continued until the end of 1943, was designed to remove all traces that mass murder. &quot;Leichenkommando&quot; (&quot;corpse units&quot;) comprising camp prisoners were created to exhume mass graves and cremate the buried bodies, using giant grills made from wood and railway tracks. Afterwards, bone fragments were ground up in special milling machines, and all remains were then re-buried in new pits. The &quot;Aktion&quot; was overseen by squads of Trawniki guards. After the war, some of the &quot;SS&quot; officers and guards were tried and sentenced at the Nuremberg trials for their role in &quot;Operation Reinhard&quot; and &quot;Sonderaktion 1005&quot;. Many others escaped conviction, such as Ernst Lerch, Globočnik&#x27;s deputy and chief of his Main Office, whose case was dropped for lack of witness testimony.

<text>A clear-channel station is a North American AM radio station that has the highest level of protection from interference from other stations, particularly from nighttime skywave signals. This classification exists to ensure the viability of cross-country or cross-continent radio service enforced through a series of treaties and statutory laws. Known as Class A stations since the 1983 adoption of the Regional Agreement for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2 (Rio Agreement), they are occasionally still referred to by their former classifications of Class I-A (the highest classification), Class I-B (the next highest class), or Class I-N (for stations in Alaska too far away to cause interference to the primary clear-channel stations in the lower 48 states). The term &quot;clear-channel&quot; is used most often in the context of North America and the Caribbean, where the concept originated.

Since 1941, these stations have been required to maintain a transmitter power output of at least 10,000 watts to retain their status. Nearly all such stations in the United States, Canada and The Bahamas broadcast with 50,000 watts, with several clear-channel stations in Mexico going as high as 150,000 watts, and XEW in Mexico City having formerly operated with 250,000 watts for over 80 years before moving the transmitter and reducing to 100,000 watts in 2016. Cuba was originally included in the plan and had several stations given clear-channel status, but stopped participating after the Cuban Revolution of 1959.

==Description==
Sixty medium wave frequencies were set aside in 1941 under the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) for use by usually only one, although in some cases two or three, AM stations, covering a wide nighttime area via skywave propagation. These frequencies were known as the &quot;clear channels&quot;, and the stations on them are thus clear-channel stations. NARBA set aside 37 Class I-A frequencies and 27 Class I-B frequencies. The Class I-N stations in Alaska shared those same frequencies. Where only one station was assigned to a clear channel, the treaty provides that it must operate with a nominal power of 50 kilowatts or more. These were for the most part Class I-A. Stations on the other clear channels, with two or more stations, must use between 10 kW and 50 kW, and most often use a directional antenna so as not to interfere with each other. In addition to the frequencies, the treaty also specified the specific locations where stations on Class I-B channels could be built.

Some of the original NARBA signatories, including the United States, Canada and Mexico, have implemented bilateral agreements that supersede NARBA&#x27;s terms, eliminating among other things the distinction between the two kinds of clear channel: the original &quot;I-A&quot; and &quot;I-B&quot; classes, and the newer, U.S.-only &quot;I-N&quot; class, which are now all included in class A. Classes &quot;I-A&quot; and &quot;I-B&quot; still mandate a minimum efficiency of 362.10 mV/m/kW at 1 km, whereas Class &quot;I-N&quot; is permitted to use the lower Class B minimum efficiency of 281.63 mV/m/kW at 1 km. There exist exceptions, where a former Class B station was elevated to Class A, yet it maintained its previous antenna system, or made only minor changes thereto.

Clear-channel stations, unlike other AM stations in North America, have protection from interference to their nighttime skywave &quot;secondary service area&quot;. Other stations are entitled, at most, to protection from nighttime interference in their &quot;primary service area&quot;—that which is covered by their groundwave signal.

Many stations beyond those listed in the treaty have been assigned to operate on a clear channel (and some had been long before NARBA came into effect in 1941). In most cases, those stations operate during the daytime only, so as not to interfere with the primary stations on those channels. Since the early 1980s, many such stations have been permitted to operate at night with such low power as to be deemed not to interfere; these stations are still considered &quot;daytimers&quot; and are not entitled to any protection from interference with their nighttime signals. Another group of stations, formerly known as class II stations, were licensed to operate on the former &quot;I-B&quot; clear channels with significant power at night, provided that they use directional antenna systems to minimize radiation towards the primary stations.

===Daytimers===

Daytimers (also known as daytime-only stations) are AM radio stations that are limited to broadcasting during the daytime only, as their signals would interfere with clear-channel and other radio stations at night, when solar radiation is reduced, and medium-frequency radio signals can propagate much farther. Such stations are allowed three manners of operation after sunset; to sign off the air completely until sunrise, reduce power (sometimes dramatically, to only a few watts), or switch to a nighttime-only frequency (such as the Detroit area&#x27;s WNZK, which broadcasts on 690 during the day, and on 680 at night). Their broadcast class is Class D. A great number of these stations use FM translators to continue their broadcasts overnight, and some also broadcast on the internet and have separate streams that air when the station&#x27;s over-the-air signal has signed off.

Daytime-only stations first originated in the late 1920s shortly after General Order 40 was imposed. One of the first to do so was WKEN in Kenmore, New York (now WUFO). WKEN proposed the concept to avoid the then-common practice of having to share one frequency between multiple stations; under General Order 40, WKEN would have had to share its frequency with WKBW, and the daytime-only proposal allowed both stations their own frequency. WUFO remains a daytime-only station to the present day, albeit with a 24/7 FM translator introduced in mid-2017.

As of 2013, daytimers exist only in the United States and Mexico. The last Canadian daytime station, CKOT, signed off on February 17 of that year after converting to the FM band. There were 61 daytimers in Mexico in 2015.

The following two tables show all of the class-A stations in North America.

First is the Canada, Mexico, and contiguous United States table, for the former class I-A and class I-B stations. General Order 40 allocations are in bold.

Second is the Alaska table, for the former class I-N stations.

Under the most recent treaty, Mexican Class A stations that previously operated with 50 kW or less (but a minimum of 10 kW nights) may increase power to 100 kW days while retaining their 10 kW night operation. This created some anomalies where stations licensed for 10 kW during all hours could increase power to 100 kW days and 10 kW nights, unless a directional antenna system was installed for nights, in which case the maximum night power was 50 kW. Additionally, one Class B station that had been operating non-directionally with 100 kW days and 50 kW nights was required to reduce power to 50 kW during all hours.

==History==
In the early days of radio, regulators had difficulty reducing interference between stations. There were two major limitations: a lack of good frequency control during the 1920s, resulting in heterodyne tones that were encountered far beyond the range of understandable audio, and no directional antennas or skywave-suppressing vertical antennas until the early 1930s. The problem was much more severe at night, when skywave signals expanded station signal coverage to hundreds of kilometers. However, with most stations located at urban locations, quality skywave service was considered to be important for providing nighttime reception to the extensive rural regions. 

For the U.S., a form of clear channels first appeared in 1923 when the Commerce Department started moving stations which had previously shared three (initially two) frequencies (two for entertainment stations, one for &quot;weather and crop reports&quot;) onto a band of frequencies from 550 to 1350 kHz, which was later extended to 1500 kHz, with 550 to 1070 kHz reserved for higher powered &quot;Class B&quot; stations. Many of the Class B frequencies were assigned to a single station, although a few were used on both the East and West coasts, which were considered far enough apart to limit interference. Class B stations with transmitters located in population centers were limited to 1,000 watts, although stations that operated transmitters at remote sites were permitted to use up to 5,000 watts.

Problems intensified in the summer of 1926, when a successful challenge was made to the government&#x27;s authority, under the Radio Act of 1912, to assign station transmitting frequencies and powers. This led to unrestricted expansion of the number of stations to 732, and increased the number of stations operating on same frequency. Moreover, previously stations had been assigned to transmitting frequencies of multiples of 10 kHz, which largely eliminated heterodynes from adjacent frequencies. However, during the lapse in regulation, some stations relocated to non-standard &quot;split frequencies&quot;, increasing heterodyne interference.

The Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was formed in March 1927, and one of its key tasks was to reorganize the chaotic broadcast band. A May 1927 reallocation began the process, in part by eliminating &quot;split frequency&quot; operations. A December 1, 1927 report on the FRC&#x27;s ongoing work reviewed operations on 600 to 1000 kHz, which divided these frequencies into ones that were considered &quot;clear&quot; and &quot;unclear&quot;. Its 1928 implementation of General Order 32 was only partially successful in reducing the number of stations. On November 11, 1928, the FRC implemented General Order 40, which classified AM band frequencies as Local, Regional or Clear. Under restrictions imposed by the Davis Amendment, eight clear channels were assigned to each of five U.S. regions. This classification also reserved a small number of frequencies for use by Canada. The maximum power for clear channel stations was gradually increased to 50,000 watts: additionally there were some short-lived experiments with 250–500 kilowatt &quot;super-power&quot; operations, most prominently by WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio

The Federal Radio Commission was replaced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1934. There was debate in Washington, D.C., and in the U.S. broadcasting industry, over whether continuation of the clear-channel system was justifiable. The licensees of clear-channel stations argued that, without their special status, many rural areas would receive no radio service at all. Rural broadcasters pointed out that most of the clear-channel stations were licensed to serve large cities on the two coasts, which made little sense for a service that was meant to provide radio to the vast rural areas in the middle of the country. On June 13, 1938, the U.S. Senate adopted resolution 294, sponsored by Burton K. Wheeler (D-Montana), which stated that it was the &quot;sense of the Senate... that the Federal Communications Commission should not adopt or promulgate rules to permit or otherwise allow any station operating on a frequency in the standard broadcast band (550 to 1600 kilocycles) to operate on a regular or other basis with power in excess of 50 kilowatts&quot;. However, the clear-channel licensees argued that a 50,000 watt limit in the U.S. should be lifted. They pointed to successful experiments made by WLW in Cincinnati before World War II, and in later years successful implementation by state broadcasters in Europe and the Middle East, as evidence that this would work and improve the service received by most Americans. Other broadcasters, particularly in the western states, argued to the contrary; that if the special status of the clear-channel stations was eliminated, they would be able to build facilities to provide local service to those rural &quot;dark areas&quot;.

The clear channel standards were continued by the March 1941 adoption of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, during which most stations shifted frequencies, in order to increase the number of Canadian clear channel assignments, as well as provide clear channels to Mexico and the Bahamas. Because FM and TV stations did not yet exist, the FCC&#x27;s main intent for the clear-channel assignments was to provide reliable radio service to the thousands of Americans who lived in the vast rural areas of the United States. As a result, these stations usually reached large portions of North America at night. Radio fans (and staff at those stations) often affectionately call such stations &quot;flamethrowers&quot; or &quot;blowtorches&quot; because of their high power, and boast about their reach by a combined state and provincial count of their coverage area. One of the most outspoken of the small-town broadcasters, Ed Craney of KGIR in Butte, Montana, went so far as to apply to move his station, then on the 1370 kHz regional channel, to a class I-A signal on 660 kHz, asking the FCC to downgrade the NBC New York flagship, WEAF, to make way for the Butte station. The FCC denied Craney&#x27;s petition.

After 1941, several clear-channel stations applied for power increases to between 500 and 750 kW; with dissemination of national defense information cited as one reason this would be in the public interest. In October 1941 the FCC&#x27;s engineering department presented a report on a complete reorganization of the clear-channel service; the report considered the possibility of &quot;some 25 superpower stations of 500,000 watts or more, strategically located to provide maximum service&quot; (as &quot;Broadcasting&quot; described it), and suggested that stations would have to be relocated away from the east and west coasts in such a scenario, as coastal stations waste energy over the oceans. One complication the FCC considered was the 1938 Wheeler resolution suggestion that stations be limited to 50 kW.

One station, KOB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, fought a long legal battle against the FCC and New York&#x27;s WABC for the right to move from a regional channel to a clear channel, 770 kHz, arguing that the New York signal was so weak in the mountain west that it served no one there. KOB eventually won the argument in the late 1960s; it and several other western stations were allowed to move to eastern clear channels. (Western clear channels, such as 680 in San Francisco, had been &quot;duplicated&quot; in the eastern states for many years.)

These new Class II-A assignments began what would later be called &quot;the breakdown of the clear channels&quot;.

The class I-A station owners&#x27; proposal to increase power fifteen-fold was not immediately quashed, but the new II-A stations would make it effectively impossible for stations on the duplicated channels to do so, and the owners eventually lost interest. That proposal was finally taken off the FCC&#x27;s docket in the late 1970s.

On May 29, 1980, the FCC voted to limit the protection for all clear-channel stations to a 750-mile (1,207 km) radius around the transmitter. Stations on those frequencies outside the area of protection were no longer required to sign off or power down after sundown.

In 1987 the FCC changed its rules to prohibit applications for new &quot;class-D&quot; stations. (Class-D stations have night power between zero and 250 watts, and frequently operate on clear channels.) However, any existing station could voluntarily relinquish nighttime authority, thereby becoming a class-D, and several have done so since the rule change.

<doc id="229460" wikidata="Q1473826" url="?curid=229460" title="Sporadic E propagation">
<text>Sporadic E (abbreviated E or SpE) is an uncommon form of radio propagation using a low level of the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere that normally does not refract radio waves above about 15 MHz.

Sporadic E propagation reflects signals off relatively small ionization patches in the lower E region located at altitudes of about 95–120 km (50–75 miles). The more conventional forms of skywave propagation in the ionosphere&#x27;s higher F region refract off layers of electrons knocked off of gas atoms and molecules by intense UV light, which are renewed on a regular repeating daily cycle. In both cases, the electrons, when present, refracts (or &quot;bends&quot;) radio signals back toward the Earth&#x27;s surface creating a &quot;bent pipe&quot; path for radio signals.

The E propagation often supports occasional long-distance communication during the approximately 6 weeks centered on summer solstice at very high frequencies (VHF), which under normal conditions can usually propagate mostly by line-of-sight.

==Overview==
As its name suggests, sporadic E is an unpredictable event that can happen at almost any time; it does, however, display strong seasonal and diurnal patterns. Sporadic E activity peaks predictably near the solstices in both hemispheres. In the mid-latitude of the Northern Hemisphere, activity usually begins in mid-May, with the peak most noticeably beginning in early June. It begins trailing off after mid-July and becomes much less reliable by early August. A much smaller sporadic-E peak occurs during the winter solstice. For the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, the timeframes are inversed; the highest activity occurring during their summer solstice.

Communication distances of 800–2,200 km (500–1,400 miles) can occur using a single E cloud. This variability in distance depends on a number of factors, including cloud height and density. The maximum usable frequency (MUF) also varies widely, but most commonly falls in the 25–150 MHz range, which includes the band II FM broadcast band (87.5–108 MHz), band I VHF television (American TV channels A2–A6, Russian channels R1–R5, and European channels E2–E4, which are no longer used in Western Europe), CB radio (27 MHz), and the amateur radio 2 meter, 4 m, 6 m, and 10 m bands. On very rare occasions, a MUF of 225 MHz can be attained.

No conclusive theory has yet been formulated as to the origin of sporadic E. Attempts to connect the incidence of sporadic E with the eleven-year Sunspot cycle have provided tentative correlations. There seems to be a positive correlation between sunspot maximum and E activity in Europe. Conversely, there seems to be a negative correlation between maximum sunspot activity and E activity in Australasia. Harrison implies that there is a correlation between the formation of sporadic E and iron/magnesium micrometeoroid ablation in the ablation zone, 100 to 140 km above the earth surface. Maruyama discusses this possibility further.

==Characteristic distances==
Television and FM signals received via sporadic E can be extremely strong and range in strength over a short period from just detectable to overloading. Although polarisation shift can occur, single-hop E signals tend to remain in the original transmitted polarization. Long single-hop () sporadic E television signals tend to be more stable and relatively free of multipath images.

Shorter-skip () signals tend to be reflected from more than one part of the sporadic E layer, resulting in multiple images and ghosting, with phase reversal at times. Picture degradation and signal-strength attenuation worsens with each subsequent sporadic E hop.

Sporadic E usually affects the lower VHF band I (TV channels A2–A6, E2–E4, and R1–R5) and band II (88–108 MHz FM broadcast band). A 1945 FCC engineering study concluded that E caused interference issues 1% of the time for a station broadcasting at 42 MHz, but only 0.01% for one at 84 MHz.

The typical expected distances are about . However, under exceptional circumstances, a highly ionized E cloud can propagate band I VHF signals down to approximately . When short-skip E reception occurs, i.e., under in band I, there is a greater possibility that the ionized sporadic E cloud will be capable of reflecting a signal at a much higher frequency – i.e., a VHF band 3 channel – since a sharp reflection angle (short skip) favours low frequencies, a shallower reflection angle from the same ionized cloud will favour a higher frequency. In this case even E DVB-T reception might be possible if a MUX uses VHF band 3, preferably channel E5, especially if QPSK mode is used, due to its low signal requirements. In addition to that, band 3 signals are more affected by tropospheric propagation which may indirectly increase the actual MUF because the signals only need to be refracted to low enough elevations that they get refracted towards the ground by the troposphere.

===Equatorial sporadic E===
Equatorial sporadic E is a regular daytime occurrence over the equatorial regions. For stations located within ±10° of the geomagnetic equator, equatorial E-skip can be expected on most days throughout the year, peaking around midday local time.

===Auroral sporadic E ===
At polar latitudes, sporadic E can accompany auroras and associated disturbed magnetic conditions and is called auroral E.

Unlike equatorial or mid-latitude E, sporadic E propagation over high latitude paths is rare, and supports unexpected contacts between locations surrounding the Arctic, even during periods of low solar activity.

==Occasional &quot;bonanza&quot; events==
On 12 June 2009, sporadic E allowed some television viewers in the eastern United States to see VHF analog TV stations from other states at great distances, in places and on TV channels where local stations had already done their permanent analog shutdown on the final day of the DTV transition in the United States. This was possible because VHF has been mostly avoided by digital TV stations, leaving the analog stations the last ones on the band.

As of April 2010, it was possible for many in the U.S. to see Canadian and Mexican analog in this manner during sporadic E events; this should continue until all parts of those countries complete their own analog TV shutdowns over the succeeding few years.

In some cases it is even possible to get DTV E receptions from well over 1,000 miles (1,600 km), since even for DTV, some U.S. stations still use band 1. These signals are characterized for being either extremely clear, or extremely blocky. They are also much easier to identify. Furthermore, ATSC 3.0 could make sporadic E DTV reception easier, due to its usual modulation scheme being more resistant to multipath propagation, as well as impulse noise encountered on those frequencies.

=== Notable sporadic E DX reception events ===
* In 1939, there were some news reports of reception of an early Italian television service in England about away.
* The Medford Mail Tribune in Medford, Oregon reported on 1 June 1953, that KGNC-TV, channel A4 in Amarillo, and KFEL-TV, channel A2 from Denver had been received on the Trowbridge and Flynn Electric Company&#x27;s television set at their Court Street warehouse, and with a pre-amplifier, a New York station&#x27;s test pattern was reportedly picked up.
* The 4 June 1953 issue of the Brimfield News in Brimfield, Illinois reported that area residents &quot; &#x27;saw&#x27; Salt Lake City Monday (via television)&quot;. It reported that a local farm family witnessed interference to WHBF-TV, channel A4 of Rock Island, Illinois by KDYL-TV in Salt Lake City, which &quot;blocked out all their favorite programs.&quot;
* In June 1981, Rijn Muntjewerff, in the Netherlands, received 55.25 MHz TV-2 Guaiba, Porto Alegre, Brazil, via a combination of sporadic E and afternoon TEP at a distance of .
* On 30 May 2003, Girard Westerberg, in Lexington, Kentucky, made the first known reception of digital television by sporadic E when he decoded the PSIP identification of KOTA-DT, broadcasting on channel A2 from Rapid City, South Dakota, away.
* On 26 June 2003, Paul Logan, in Lisnaskea, Ireland, was the first DXer to receive transatlantic sporadic E at frequencies above 88 MHz. Stations received included 88.5 MHz WHCF Bangor, Maine (), and 97.5 MHz WFRY Watertown, New York (). David Hamilton from Cumnock in Ayrshire, Scotland, received CBTB from Baie Verte, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, on 97.1 MHz on this day also.
* On 20 July 2003, Jozsef Nemeth, in Győr, Hungary, received TR3 Radio Miras on OIRT FM 70.61 MHz from Uly Balkan, Türkmenistan, transmitter away.
* On 15 June 2005, Danny Oglethorpe in Shreveport, Louisiana, received a KBEJ-TV test signal on channel A2, from Fredericksburg, Texas, by sporadic E, at a very short distance for this propagation mode: .
* On 26 June 2009, Paul Logan, in Lisnaskea, Ireland, had transatlantic sporadic E reception on the FM band from eight US States and one Canadian Province. The most distant signal received was that of 90.7 WVAS radio in Montgomery, Alabama, at 6,456 km (4,012 miles). This reception was recorded and later confirmed by WVAS newsreader Marcus Hyles.
* On 31 May, 2010 Mike Fallon in East Sussex, UK received a transatlantic signal from the religious station La Voz de la Luz in Salvaléon de Higüey, Dominican Republic on 88.7MHz from 12:48 UTC for approximately 20 minutes at a distance of 4302 miles/6924Km via multihop Sporadic-E. This reception was confirmed via an email from the station.
* On 24 November 2016, many radio listeners from Australia and New Zealand were able to listen to radio stations from other states of Australia, overlapping many radio signals. Many people complained about this, saying that many of their favorite radio stations got replaced by different radio stations from other states. Later, the ACMA confirmed that this was caused by sporadic E.

<text>National Geographic (formerly The National Geographic Magazine, sometimes branded as Nat Geo) is an American monthly magazine published by National Geographic Partners. The magazine was founded in 1888 as a scholarly journal, nine months after the establishment of the society, but is now a popular magazine. In 1905, it began including pictures, a style for which it became well-known. Its first color photos appeared in the 1910s. During the Cold War, the magazine committed itself to present a balanced view of the physical and human geography of countries beyond the Iron Curtain. Later, the magazine became outspoken on environmental issues.

Until 2015, the magazine was completely owned and managed by the National Geographic Society. Since 2015, controlling interest has been held by National Geographic Partners.

Topics of features generally concern geography, history, nature, science, and world culture. The magazine is well known for its distinctive appearance: a thick square-bound glossy format with a yellow rectangular border. Map supplements from National Geographic Maps are included with subscriptions, and it is available in a traditional printed edition and an interactive online edition.

, the magazine was circulated worldwide in nearly forty local-language editions and had a global circulation of at least 6.5 million per month including 3.5 million within the U.S., down from about 12 million in the late 1980s. , the magazine had won 25 National Magazine Awards.

In 2023, &quot;National Geographic&quot; laid off all staff writers and announced they would stop U.S. newsstand sales in the next year.

, its Instagram page has 280 million followers, the third most of any account not belonging to an individual celebrity. The magazine&#x27;s combined U.S. and international circulation as of June 30, 2024 was about 1.65 million, with its kids magazines separately achieving a circulation of about 500,000.

==History==

The first issue of the &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; was published on September 22, 1888, eight months after the Society was founded. In the first issue, Gardiner Greene Hubbard writes, 
It was initially a scholarly journal sent to 165 charter members; in 2010, it reached the hands of 40 million people each month. Starting with its January 1905 publication of several full-page pictures of Tibet in 1900–01, the magazine began to transition from being a text-oriented publication to featuring extensive pictorial content. By 1908 more than half of the magazine&#x27;s pages were photographs. The June 1985 cover portrait of a 12-year-old Afghan girl Sharbat Gula, shot by photographer Steve McCurry, became one of the magazine&#x27;s most recognizable images.

&quot;National Geographic Kids&quot;, the children&#x27;s version of the magazine, was launched in 1975 under the name &quot;National Geographic World&quot;.

At its peak in the late 1980s, the magazine had 12 million subscribers in the United States, and millions more outside of the U.S.

In the late 1990s, the magazine began publishing &quot;The Complete National Geographic&quot;, an electronic collection of every past issue of the magazine. It was then sued over copyright of the magazine as a collective work in &quot;Greenberg v. National Geographic&quot; and other cases, and temporarily withdrew the compilation. The magazine eventually prevailed in the dispute, and in July 2009 resumed publishing all past issues through December 2008. More recent issues were later added to the collection; the archive and electronic edition of the magazine are available online to the magazine&#x27;s subscribers.

In September 2015, the National Geographic Society moved the magazine to a new owner, National Geographic Partners, giving 21st Century Fox a 73% controlling interest in exchange for $725 million. In December 2017, a deal was announced for Disney to acquire 21st Century Fox, including the controlling interest in National Geographic Partners. The acquisition was completed in March 2019. NG Media publishing unit was operationally transferred into Disney Publishing Worldwide.

In September 2022, the magazine laid off six of its top editors. In June 2023, the magazine laid off all of its staff writers, shifting to an entirely freelance-based writing model, and announced that beginning in 2024 it would no longer offer newsstand purchases.

==Administration==

===Editors-in-chief===

The magazine had a single &quot;editor&quot; from 1888 to 1920. From 1920 to 1967, the chief editorship was held by the president of the National Geographic Society. Since 1967, the magazine has been overseen by its own &quot;editor&quot; and/or &quot;editor-in-chief&quot;. The list of editors-in-chief includes three generations of the Grosvenor family between 1903 and 1980.
* Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor (1875–1966): (Editor-in-Chief: February 1903– January 1920; Managing Editor: September 1900 – February 1903; Assistant Editor: May 1899 – September 1900)
* John Oliver La Gorce (1879–1959): (May 1954 – January 1957) (president of the society at the same time)
* Melville Bell Grosvenor (1901–1982): (January 1957 – August 1967) (president of the society at the same time) (thereafter editor-in-chief to 1977)
* Frederick Vosburgh (1905–2005): (August 1967 – October 1970)
* Gilbert Melville Grosvenor (born 1931): (October 1970 – July 1980) (then became president of the society)
* Wilbur E. Garrett: (July 1980 – April 1990)
* William Graves: (April 1990 – December 1994)
* William L. Allen: (January 1995 – January 2005)
* Chris Johns: (January 2005 – April 2014) (first &quot;editor-in-chief&quot; since MBG)
* Susan Goldberg: (April 2014 – April 2022)
* Nathan Lump: (May 2022 – present)

==Articles==
During the Cold War, the magazine committed itself to present a balanced view of the physical and human geography of countries beyond the Iron Curtain. The magazine printed articles on Berlin, de-occupied Austria, the Soviet Union, and Communist China that deliberately downplayed politics to focus on culture. In its coverage of the Space Race, &quot;National Geographic&quot; focused on the scientific achievement while largely avoiding reference to the race&#x27;s connection to nuclear arms buildup. There were also many articles in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s about the individual states and their resources, along with supplementary maps of each state. Many of these articles were written by longtime staff such as Frederick Simpich.

After 21st Century Fox acquired controlling interest in the magazine, articles became outspoken on topics such as environmental issues, deforestation, chemical pollution, global warming, and endangered species. Series of articles were included focusing on the history and varied uses of specific products such as a single metal, gem, food crop, or agricultural product, or an archaeological discovery. Occasionally an entire month&#x27;s issue would be devoted to a single country, past civilization, a natural resource whose future is endangered, or other themes. In recent decades, the National Geographic Society has unveiled other magazines with different focuses. Whereas the magazine featured lengthy expositions in the past, recent issues have included shorter articles.

==Photography==
In addition to being well known for articles about scenery, history, and the most distant corners of the world, the magazine has been recognized for its book-like quality and the high standard of its photography. It was during the tenure of Society President Alexander Graham Bell and editor Gilbert H. Grosvenor (GHG) that the significance of illustration was first emphasized, in spite of criticism from some of the Board of Managers who considered the many illustrations an indicator of an &quot;unscientific&quot; conception of geography. By 1910, photographs had become the magazine&#x27;s trademark and Grosvenor was constantly on the search for &quot;dynamical pictures&quot; as Graham Bell called them, particularly those that provided a sense of motion in a still image. In 1915, GHG began building the group of staff photographers and providing them with advanced tools including the latest darkroom.

The magazine began to feature some pages of color photography in the early 1930s, when this technology was still in its early development. During the mid-1930s, Luis Marden (1913–2003), a writer and photographer for &quot;National Geographic&quot;, convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use the so-called &quot;miniature&quot; 35 mm Leica cameras loaded with Kodachrome film over bulkier cameras with heavy glass plates that required the use of tripods. In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs. National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, to allow for a full-page photograph taken for one of the month&#x27;s articles. Issues of &quot;National Geographic&quot; are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles. The standard for photography has remained high over the subsequent decades and the magazine is still illustrated with some of the highest-quality photojournalism in the world. In 2006, &quot;National Geographic&quot; began an international photography competition, with over eighteen countries participating.

==Map supplements==

Supplementing the articles, the magazine sometimes provides maps of the regions visited.
National Geographic Maps (originally the Cartographic Division) became a division of the National Geographic Society in 1915. The first supplement map, which appeared in the May 1918 issue of the magazine, titled &quot;The Western Theatre of War&quot;, served as a reference for overseas military personnel and soldiers&#x27; families alike. On some occasions, the Society&#x27;s map archives have been used by the United States government in instances where its own cartographic resources were limited. President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s White House map room was filled with National Geographic maps. A National Geographic map of Europe is featured in the displays of the Winston Churchill museum in London showing Churchill&#x27;s markings at the Yalta Conference where the Allied leaders divided post-war Europe.

In 2001, &quot;National Geographic&quot; released an eight-CD-ROM set containing all its maps from 1888 to December 2000. Printed versions are also available from the National Geographic website.

==Language editions==

===Active===
In April 1995, &quot;National Geographic&quot; began publishing in Japanese, its first local language edition. The magazine is currently published in 29 local editions around the world.


===Discontinued===
The following local-language editions have been discontinued.


In association with Trends Publications in Beijing and IDG Asia, &quot;National Geographic&quot; has been authorized for &quot;copyright cooperation&quot; in China to publish the yellow-border magazine, which launched with the July 2007 issue of the magazine with an event in Beijing on July 10, 2007, and another event on December 6, 2007, in Beijing also celebrating the 29th anniversary of normalization of U.S.–China relations featuring former President Jimmy Carter. The mainland China version is one of the two local-language editions that bump the &quot;National Geographic&quot; logo off its header in favor of a local-language logo; the other one is the Persian version published under the name &quot;Gita Nama&quot;.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian version of &quot;National Geographic&quot; was discontinued effective April 2022. Its publication team then launched the &quot;Russian Traveler&quot;, which is not associated with the &quot;National Geographic&quot; brand.

==Distribution==

In the United States, &quot;National Geographic&quot; is available only to subscribers beginning with the January 2024 issue. For the first 110 years of the magazine&#x27;s existence, membership in the National Geographic Society was the only way to receive it. Newsstand sales, which began in 1998, ceased in 2023, following a year of layoffs and a shift in focus to digital formats amid the decline of the print media industry.

Worldwide editions are sold on newsstands in addition to regular subscriptions. In several countries, such as Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Turkey and Ukraine, &quot;National Geographic&quot; paved the way for a subscription model in addition to traditional newsstand sales.

==Awards==
On May 1, 2008, &quot;National Geographic&quot; won three National Magazine Awards—an award solely for its written content—in the reporting category for an article by Peter Hessler on the Chinese economy; an award in the photojournalism category for work by John Stanmeyer on malaria in the Third World; and a prestigious award for general excellence.

Between 1980 and 2011, the magazine has won a total of 24 National Magazine Awards.

In May 2006, 2007, and 2011, &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine won the American Society of Magazine Editors&#x27; General Excellence Award in the over two million circulation category. In 2010, &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; received the top ASME awards for photojournalism and essay. In 2011, &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; received the top-award from ASME – the Magazine of the Year Award.

In April 2014, &quot;National Geographic&quot; received the National Magazine Award (&quot;Ellie&quot;) for best tablet edition for its multimedia presentation of Robert Draper&#x27;s story &quot;The Last Chase&quot;, about the final days of a tornado researcher who was killed in the line of duty.

In February 2017, &quot;National Geographic&quot; received the National Magazine Award (&quot;Ellie&quot;) for best website. &quot;National Geographic&quot; won the 2020 Webby Award for News &amp; Magazines in the category Apps, Mobile &amp; Voice. &quot;National Geographic&quot; won the 2020 Webby Award and Webby People&#x27;s Voice Award for Magazine in the category Web.

==Controversies==
On the magazine&#x27;s February 1982 cover, the pyramids of Giza were altered, resulting in the first major scandal of the digital photography age and contributing to photography&#x27;s &quot;waning credibility&quot;.

The cover of the October 1988 issue featured a photo of a large ivory portrait of a male, whose authenticity, particularly the alleged ice age provenance, has been questioned.

In 1999, the magazine was embroiled in the &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; scandal, in which it purported to have a fossil linking birds to dinosaurs. The fossil was a forgery.

In 2010, the magazine&#x27;s Your Shot competition was awarded to American filmmaker and photographer William Lascelles for a photograph presented as a portrait of a dog with fighter jets flying over its shoulder. Lascelles had in reality created the image using photo editing software.

After the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014, &quot;National Geographic&quot; published maps with the Crimean peninsula marked as &quot;contested&quot;, contrary to international norms.

In March 2018, the editor of &quot;National Geographic&quot;, Susan Goldberg, said that historically the magazine&#x27;s coverage of people around the world had been racist. Goldberg stated that the magazine ignored non-white Americans and showed different groups as exotic, thereby promoting racial clichés.

<text>The Cybermen are a fictional race of cyborgs principally portrayed in the British science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The Cybermen are a species of space-faring cyborgs who often forcefully and painfully convert human beings (or other similar species) into more Cybermen in order to populate their ranks while also removing their emotions and personalities. They were conceived by writer Kit Pedler (who was also the unofficial scientific advisor to the series) and story editor Gerry Davis, and first appeared in the 1966 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;.

The Cybermen have seen many redesigns and costume changes over &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s long run, as well as a number of varying origin stories. In their first appearance, &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; (1966), they are humans from Earth&#x27;s nearly identical &quot;twin planet&quot; of Mondas who upgraded themselves into cyborgs in a bid for self-preservation. Forty years later, the two-part story, &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot; (2006), depicted Cybermen invented again in a parallel universe London as a business corporation&#x27;s attempt at upgrading humanity. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas, novels, and comic books have also elaborated on existing origin stories or presented alternatives. The 2017 episode, &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot;, explains the different origins as parallel evolution, due to the inevitability of humans and human-like species upgrading themselves through technology; this perspective resolves continuity differences in the Cybermen&#x27;s history.

A mainstay of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; since the 1960s, the Cybermen have also appeared in related programmes and spin-off media, including novels, audiobooks, comic books, and video games. Cybermen stories were produced in officially licensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; products between 1989 and 2005, when the TV show was off the air, with writers either filling historical gaps or depicting new encounters between them and the Doctor. The species also appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV spin-off, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, appearing in the fourth episode, &quot;Cyberwoman&quot; (2006).

== Creation ==

The name &quot;Cyberman&quot; comes from cybernetics, a term used in Norbert Wiener&#x27;s book &quot;Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine&quot; (MIT Press, 1948). Wiener used the term in reference to the control of complex systems, particularly self-regulating control systems, in the animal world and in mechanical networks. By 1960, doctors were researching surgical or mechanical augmentation of humans and animals to operate machinery in space, leading to the portmanteau &quot;cyborg&quot;, for &quot;cybernetic organism&quot;.

In the 1960s, &quot;spare-part&quot; surgery began with the development of gigantic heart-lung machines. Public discussion included the possibility of wiring amputees&#x27; nerve endings directly into machines. In 1963, Kit Pedler discussed with his wife (who was also a doctor) what would happen if a person had so many prostheses that they could no longer distinguish themselves between man and machine. He got the opportunity to develop this idea when, in 1966, after an appearance on the BBC science programmes &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Horizon&quot;, the BBC hired him to consult on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The War Machines&quot; (1966). That eventually led to him writing, with Gerry Davis, &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; (1966) for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Pedler, influenced by the logic-driven Treens from the &quot;Dan Dare&quot; comic strip, originally envisaged the Cybermen as &quot;space monks&quot;, but was persuaded by Davis to concentrate on his fears about the direction of spare-part surgery. The Cybermen were originally imagined as human but with plastic and metal prostheses. The Cybermen of &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; still have human hands, and their facial structures are visible beneath the masks they wear, but over time they evolved into metallic, more fully mechanized designs.

A variety of specialized forms of Cybermen have been shown, in particular Cyber Leaders and Cyber Controllers, with power to command other Cybermen.

== Appearances ==
=== Television ===
==== Classic series (1963–1996) ====

The Cybermen first appear in the serial &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; in 1966, set in 1986. This story explains how, millions of years ago, Earth had a twin planet known as Mondas that was knocked out of solar orbit and drifted into deep space. The Mondasians, already far in advance of Earth&#x27;s technology and fearful for their race&#x27;s survival, replaced most of their bodies with cybernetic parts. Having eventually removed all emotion from their brains (to maintain their sanity), the natives installed a drive propulsion system to pilot the planet itself through space. As the original race was limited in numbers and were continually being depleted, the Mondasians – now Cybermen – became a race of conquerors who reproduced by forcibly changing other organic beings into Cybermen. The First Doctor (William Hartnell) opposes these Cybermen when they attempt to drain the Earth&#x27;s energy to make way for Mondas&#x27; return to the solar system; in this encounter, Mondas absorbs too much energy from Earth, destroying it and all Cybermen on Earth. The adventure takes its physical toll on the Doctor, forcing him to regenerate for the first time, becoming the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton).

The Cybermen next appeared later in the same television season in &quot;The Moonbase&quot; (1967) opposite the Second Doctor. In 2070, the Cybermen attempt to remotely destroy the Earth by affecting its weather patterns with a device called the Gravitron. However, the Gravitron is used against them, hurling them into space. In the following season, &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; saw a 25th Century human expedition discover sarcophagi containing hibernating Cybermen on the planet Telos, where the creatures arise and attack. This episode introduced the cybermats, small mechanical scouts used by the Cybermen, as well as the Cyber Controller. In &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; (1968), the Doctor and his crew face off against the Cybermen on a marooned Earth space station in the 21st century. This episode introduces the Cyber-Planner, an immobile unit which directs the Cybermen. The Cybermen plan to take over the space station, after which their fleet will invade Earth. The Doctor uses an x-ray laser to destroy the Cybermen. In the next season, &quot;The Invasion&quot; has the Doctor and his companions visit late 20th century England, where he discovers an army of Cybermen are hidden on Earth and working with magnate Tobias Vaughn (Kevin Stoney) to invade Earth. Their invasion is defeated by the Doctor and the military support of the newly formed United Nations Intelligence Taskforce.

The Cybermen did not face the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) during his era, but one is shown as part of an exhibit in &quot;Carnival of Monsters&quot; (1973). The Third Doctor would however face Cybermen in the 20th anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983).

The Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) is next to encounter a group of Cybermen in &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; (1975). These Cybermen are depicted as the wandering remnants of a fallen empire, ravaged by the so-called Cyber-Wars against victorious humanity, which had exploited the Cybermen&#x27;s weakness to gold. These Cybermen attempt to restore the glory of their race by destroying the gold-rich asteroid Voga.

Cybermen were not seen again until &quot;Earthshock&quot; (1982), in which the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) encounters Cybermen in Earth in the year 2526. The Cybermen plan to destroy the planet with a large bomb while alien dignitaries visit Earth to discuss the ongoing Cyber-Wars. After the Doctor foils this plan, they decide to crash their freighter into the planet to achieve the same result. The freighter is hurled back in time, however, and the Doctor&#x27;s companion, boy genius Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), is trapped on board as the freighter crashes into prehistoric Earth, killing Adric and triggering the K-T extinction event. The Cybermen appear once more in the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s era, alongside the four previous Doctors, in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), when they are transported to the Doctor&#x27;s home planet of Gallifrey by the Time Lord President Borusa (Philip Latham).

&quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot; (1985) is set after &quot;Tomb&quot;. The Cybermen attempt to use a time machine to avert the destruction of Mondas by causing Halley&#x27;s Comet to crash into the Earth. Their plan fails and, due to the intervention of the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker), they also lose their adopted homeworld of Telos to its original inhabitants, the Cryons.

The Cybermen appeared for a final time in the classic series in &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot; (1988), in which a fleet of Cybermen warships assemble to convert Earth into a new Mondas. A Cybermen scouting party is sent to Earth in search of the legendary Nemesis statue, a Time Lord artefact of immense power, made of the &quot;living metal&quot; validium. The intervention of the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and his companion Ace (Sophie Aldred), however, ensures that the Nemesis destroys the entire cyber-fleet instead.

Between the series&#x27; cancellation and subsequent revival, the Cybermen make one brief appearance, in the 1993 Children in Need special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, as one of several enemies used by evil Time Lady the Rani (Kate O&#x27;Mara) to hunt the Doctor.

==== Revived series (2005–present) ====

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; was revived after a long hiatus by new showrunner Russell T Davies in 2005. By then, development of CGI enabled large numbers of Cybermen or Daleks to be featured in stories. In the first series of the revived programme, the Cybermen do not appear except for the inactive head of one, which is seen in a private museum of alien artefacts on Earth in the episode &quot;Dalek&quot;. For Series 2 in 2006, Cybermen were reintroduced with a new origin story set in a parallel universe. In the &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot; two-part story, the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companions, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke), crash land in a parallel London where the Cybermen are being created on modern-day Earth. The Cybermen are created by the owner of Cybus Industries, the dying transhumanist mad scientist John Lumic (Roger Lloyd-Pack). Lumic&#x27;s Cybermen successfully convert much of the world&#x27;s population by placing their human brains into robotic shells. The Doctor and his friends free London from their control. A human resistance group, the Preachers, then sets about to clean up the remainder of Lumic&#x27;s factories around the world. The Cybermen reappear in the 2006 two-part finale &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Doomsday&quot;, exploiting a breach between universes to invade the Doctor&#x27;s Earth. This breach is caused by a transport device belonging to the Daleks, who reveal themselves and trigger all-out war between the two species. The Doctor ultimately re-opens the breach, causing the Cybermen and all but a few Daleks to become trapped inside before it is re-sealed. Cybermen next appear in the 2008 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas special &quot;The Next Doctor&quot;, emerging in 1851 London after the Daleks damaged the walls of reality in the previous episode, &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. They attempt to raise a new army on Earth using period technology, but are again foiled by the Doctor.

After Steven Moffat took over the role of executive producer in 2010, Cybermen of essentially the design introduced by Davies continued to appear. No explicit reference is made to their origin, but generally the stylised &#x27;c&#x27; (for Cybus Corporation) on their breastplate had been replaced by a plain circle, implying that they were not from the parallel universe. They appear in &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot; (2010) alongside many of the Doctor&#x27;s recurring enemies as part of an alliance dedicated to stopping him, arriving in cyber ships in 102 CE. They appear again in &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot; (2011), when the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s (Matt Smith) companion Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) demands the location of a secret asteroid base in a quadrant of space which they monitor in the 52nd century. The Doctor destroys a large fleet of their spaceships to indicate their seriousness. In &quot;Closing Time&quot;, an ancient slumbering cyber ship is awakened in 2011 Colchester, and the Doctor and his friend Craig Owens (James Corden) work together to repel a Cyberman invasion. This episode also reintroduces cybermats to the series. Neil Gaiman&#x27;s episode &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot; (2013) depicts the re-emergence of the Cybermen in the distant future, following what was believed to be their complete eradication by humankind. These redesigned Cybermen have discarded many of their limitations, exhibiting increased speed, rapid upgrading to overcome weaknesses, and the ability to convert any biological organism into their ranks. The Eleventh Doctor undergoes a partial cyber-conversion, and mentally duels with a Cyber-Planner for control of his body. The emperor of the galaxy (Warwick Davis) orders a planet&#x27;s destruction to wipe out the Cyberman, but one intact (new, minuscule cybermat variants) is later seen floating through space. A dead Cyberman head is briefly shown in the UNIT Black Archive in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, and in &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; they are among the many species which besiege the planet Trenzalore for centuries. In the latter episode, the Doctor also uses a disembodied Cyberman head, devoid of any remaining organic parts; named &quot;Handles&quot;, he serves as the Doctor&#x27;s personal assistant and confidant for several centuries until his eventual &#x27;death&#x27; brings the Doctor to tears.
In the two-part finale of the 2014 series, &quot;Dark Water&quot; and &quot;Death in Heaven&quot;, the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) learns too late that the Cybermen have formed an alliance with a female incarnation of the Master, Missy (Michelle Gomez), who is converting the stolen bodies of the dead into an army. A process begins on all of Earth&#x27;s dead. Missy offers the Doctor control of the Cybermen army so they can rule the universe together, but her plan is foiled when Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson), the cyber-converted boyfriend of the Doctor&#x27;s companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), resists his programming and destroys himself along with all the other Cybermen. Cybermen are next seen in &quot;Face the Raven&quot; (2015), among the various alien refugees hiding in London, and in series finale &quot;Hell Bent&quot;, in which a rusted Cyberman is imprisoned in the Cloisters of Gallifrey. The origin of another group of Cybermen is told in the two-part Series 10 finale &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; and &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot;, when a Mondasian colony ship is stuck escaping the gravity of a black hole for many years. The human-like Mondasians, assisted unknowingly by the Master (John Simm), begin upgrading their population to adapt to life aboard the decaying ship. The Doctor reflects on all the societies that have created Cybermen and concludes that the Cybermen is an example of parallel evolution; the Cybermen will always arise and be developed on human-like species across the universe. Ultimately, this encounter with the Cybermen proves brutal: the Doctor&#x27;s companion Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) is ; two incarnations of the Master (Simm and Gomez) kill one another in a disagreement over standing alongside the Doctor; and the Doctor&#x27;s companion Nardole (Matt Lucas) is left behind on the ship to look after human colonists, for whom inevitable has been delayed but not averted, though the Doctor manages to destroy most of the Cybermen in a massive explosion. The Doctor, exhausted and wounded to a point of nearing death, awakens in his TARDIS and begins to regenerate. At the same time, the Bill is saved by her old flame Heather who turns her into the same sort of being Heather became after being infected by a sentient liquid.

Cybermen feature heavily in Series 12 (2020). In &quot;Fugitive of the Judoon&quot;, experienced companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) sends a message to the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker): &quot;do not give the lone Cyberman what it wants&quot;. In &quot;The Haunting of Villa Diodati&quot;, the Doctor encounters this Cyberman, the sole survivor of the Cyber-Wars, partially-converted Ashad (Patrick O&#x27;Kane). She ignores Jack&#x27;s warning and gives him the Cyberium, the total knowledge of the defeated Cyberman empire, to save human history. This leads to Ashad rejuvenating the Cyber-Empire in season finale &quot;Ascension of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Timeless Children&quot;, intending to end all organic life in the universe with a &quot;Death Particle&quot; once he transforms the Cybermen into a purely technological race. However, the Master (Sacha Dhawan) intervenes, promising an alliance only to swiftly betrays Ashad, confiscating the Cyberium and converting the massacred Time Lord civilisation into &quot;CyberMasters&quot; – a new race of infinitely regenerating Cybermen. This army is seemingly defeated by a miniaturised version of the Death Particle. A Cyberman is later seen in the 2021 New Years Special &quot;Revolution of the Daleks&quot; as one of the Doctor&#x27;s cellmates in a Judoon prison. The CyberMasters and a clone of Ashad return alongside the Master in a daring scheme alongside the Daleks to steal the Doctor&#x27;s body in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; (2022), narrowly defeated only when the Doctor&#x27;s companions succeed in bringing her back to life.

In the revival series, some Cybermen who have interacted with the Doctor have been portrayed by actor Paul Kasey.

=== Spin-offs ===
The Cybermen have appeared in various spin-off media.

==== Novels ====
The Cybermen were also featured in the novel &quot;Iceberg&quot; by actor David Banks, who played the Cyber Leader in the television series from &quot;Earthshock&quot; to &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot;. Banks had previously written, in 1988, &quot;Cybermen&quot;, a fictional history of the Cybermen which included a &quot;future&quot; design for them. The Missing Adventure Novel &quot;Killing Ground&quot; also features Cybermen of the type seen in &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;. During this novel, the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s new companion Grant Markham returns to his home planet and learns that a group of Cybermen have hidden on it for centuries, with his robophobia being based around the repressed memory of witnessing a Cyberman kill his mother before he escaped.

In two Virgin Missing Adventures novels by Craig Hinton, the Cybermen become Cyberlords at some point in their history. They are mentioned in passing in Hinton&#x27;s &quot;The Crystal Bucephalus&quot;, where the Cyberlord Hegemony is a peaceful future version of the Cybermen who have an empire in the Milky Way; their description was modelled after Banks&#x27;s designs. In &quot;The Quantum Archangel&quot;, there are numerous unexplained references to the Cyberlords as an extremely advanced race. At one point, they are referred to as the Time Lords&#x27; greatest ally in the Millennium War, though because that war was supposed to have taken place a very long time before the modern era, it is unclear how this bit of Cyberhistory fits in or whether or not they have achieved advanced time travel capabilities. While not explicitly mentioned, Hinton may have adopted this idea from the aborted script for the Five Doctors by Robert Holmes (scriptwriter), which would have had the Cybermen adopting Time Lord DNA to achieve their higher state of being.

The Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Illegal Alien&quot; featured Cybermen and Cybermats in London during the Blitz. Cyber-technology left over from that adventure was subsequently misused in &quot;Loving the Alien&quot;, written by the same authors. The Fifth Doctor story &quot;Warmonger&quot; by Terrance Dicks has the Cybermen join the Doctor&#x27;s alliance against Morbius. The First Doctor story &quot;The Time Travellers&quot; by Simon Guerrier, set in an alternate reality, has the Cybermen (who are never named) living at the South Pole and trading advanced technology to South Africa. The Eighth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Hope&quot; by Mark Clapham features the Silverati, a group of cybernetically enhanced humans heavily reminiscent of the Cybermen, in existence in the very far future as the universe approaches its end, with some evidence suggesting that the Silverati were adapted from remnants of the Cybermen of the present.

==== Audio dramas ====
The Cybermen have appeared in several Big Finish audio plays battling the Doctor, the first of which was &quot;Sword of Orion&quot; (released on CD in 2001 and broadcast on BBC 7 in 2005), where the Eighth Doctor deals with humans and androids engaged in a war who seek Cyber-technology to improve their sides. The 2002 play &quot;Spare Parts&quot; explored aspects of the Cybermen&#x27;s origin, revealing that the design was ironically only perfected after their creator, Doctorman Allan, studied the biology of the Fifth Doctor and duplicated a third lobe to the Doctor&#x27;s brain that controlled his body functions. They were the villains in the company&#x27;s BBCi webcast &quot;Real Time&quot;, which was released on purely audio in December 2002. The first instalment of a four-CD series titled &quot;Cyberman&quot;, which does not feature the Doctor, was released in September 2005. &quot;Sword of Orion&quot; and the &quot;Cyberman&quot; series are set around the &quot;Great Orion Cyber-Wars&quot; of the 26th century, when androids rebelled against humanity in the Orion System and both human and android turned to the Cybermen to gain a military advantage. In &quot;Sword of Orion&quot;, the Cybermen are still entombed on Telos and are mostly forgotten, setting it before &quot;Earthshock&quot;; by the time of &quot;Cyberman&quot;, Telos has been destroyed by an asteroid collision, placing that series after &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;.

The Cybermen appeared in a linked trilogy of plays entitled &quot;The Harvest&quot; (2004), &quot;The Reaping&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Gathering&quot; (2006), where small groups of Cybermen attempt to manipulate humans into setting up conversion factories on Earth. The Bernice Summerfield play &quot;The Crystal of Cantus&quot; features a former human colony turned into Cybermen, with Irving Braxiatel planning to use them as a private army. A Cyberman tomb also appeared in the Bernice Summerfield play &quot;Silver Lining&quot;, which came free with &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; #351. They appear in &quot;Human Resources&quot;, which Big Finish produced for radio BBC 7 and subsequently released on CD, and sees the Eighth Doctor averting a plan to take control of a new weapons system. The Sixth Doctor joins forces with the Second Doctor&#x27;s companions Jamie and Zoe to deal with two different Cybermen assaults in &quot;Legend of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;Last of the Cybermen&quot;; &quot;Legend&quot; sees Zoe made into the new Mistress of the Land of Fiction, bringing in the Sixth Doctor and a fictional version of Jamie to stop the Cybermen conquering the Land, and &quot;Last&quot; depicts the Sixth swapping places with the Second just as the younger Doctor discovers a Cybermen plot to alter the outcome of the last battle of the Cyber-Wars. In the Fourth Doctor Adventures audio &quot;The Fate of Krelos&quot;/&quot;Return to Telos&quot;, the Fourth Doctor, Leela and K9 discover that the Cybermen planted nanobots on Jamie during their past trip to Telos that allow the Cybermen to infect K9 and subsequently use the TARDIS to take over the machinery of the planet Krelos, but the Doctor is able to use a robot drone to go back to his original trip to Telos and prevent Jamie being exposed to the nanites, undoing these events.

In March 2018, the Cybermen had their first encounter with the Third Doctor (this time played by Tim Treloar) in &quot;The Tyrants of Logic&quot;, one of the stories in Volume 4 of Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;The Third Doctor Adventures&quot; series. In the story, the Doctor and companion Jo Grant (Katy Manning) arrive in the town of Port Anvil on the planet Burnt Salt. They come across a mysterious crate, which the Cybermen set about to reclaim as it contains the &quot;Cyber Leveler,&quot; a type of tactician similar to the Cyber Controller. In the ensuing adventure, the Doctor is exposed to &quot;Cyber Smoke,&quot; a poisonous gas that prepares a body for cyber conversion. The Doctor is able to fight off the infection for a time, and develop a cure, which he then uses against the Cybermen, defeating them. The Cybermen battle the Third Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith in the Audio Novel &quot;Scourge of the Cybermen&quot;. David Banks reprised his role as the Cyber-Leader in &quot;Hour of the Cybermen&quot;, against the Sixth Doctor and UNIT, and &quot;Conversion&quot;, which served as a follow-up to &quot;Earthshock&quot;.

==== Comics ====
They have also appeared in the various &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strips, beginning with &quot;The Coming of the Cybermen&quot; in &quot;TV Comic&quot; #824-#827. TV Comic cashed in on their frequent presence in the TV series in the late 1960s by featuring them regularly, and they appeared in &quot;Flower Power&quot; (TVC #832-#835), &quot;Cyber-Mole&quot; (TVC #842-#845), &quot;The Cyber Empire&quot; (TVC #850-#853), &quot;Eskimo Joe&quot; (TVC #903-#906), &quot;Masquerade&quot; (TVC Holiday Special 1968), &quot;The Time Museum&quot; (TVC Annual 1969), &quot;The Champion&quot; (TVC Holiday Special 1969) and &quot;Test-Flight&quot; (TVC Annual 1970). Their absence from the TV show for most of the 1970s was reflected in a lack of appearances in the strip: they eventually returned in the early 1980s in the &quot;Doctor Who Monthly&quot; strip &quot;Junk-Yard Demon&quot; (DWM #58-#59). They made further appearances after the publication was re-titled &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;: &quot;Exodus&quot;/&quot;Revelation&quot;/&quot;Genesis&quot; (DWM #108-#110), &quot;The World Shapers&quot; (DWM #127-#129, written by Grant Morrison, which revealed that the Voord were the race that evolved into the Cybermen and that Mondas was previously the planet Marinus), &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; (DWM #175-#178) and &quot;The Flood&quot; (DWM #346-#353). In addition, a Cyberman named Kroton, who originally appeared in a couple of &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; back-up strips called &quot;Throwback: The Soul of a Cyberman&quot; (DWW #5-#7) and &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (DWW #23-#24), was reintroduced in &quot;Unnatural Born Killers&quot; (DWM #277) and was briefly a companion of the Eighth Doctor in &quot;The Company of Thieves&quot; (DWM #284-#286) and &quot;The Glorious Dead&quot; (DWM #287-#296). The Cybermen had their own one-page strip in DWM from issues #215-#238, written by Alan Barnes and drawn by Adrian Salmon.

In 1996, the &quot;Radio Times&quot; published a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strip. The first story, entitled &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, featured the Cybermen attacking a human starship in 2220 and introduced the strip companion Stacy Townsend.

In 2006/2007, the Trading Cards magazine Doctor Who - Battles in Time issues 8 - 11 ran a sixteen-page comic strip consisting of four linked stories featuring the Cybermen, written by Steve Cole, drawn by Lee Sullivan and coloured by Alan Craddock.

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot;/&quot;Star Trek&quot; crossover, &quot;Assimilation2&quot;, the Cybermen join forces with the Borg, forcing the Eleventh Doctor to join forces with the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D to stop them. The Borg and Cybermen have begun to attack and convert worlds without warning, with the apparent &#x27;leader&#x27; being a Cyber-Controller with Borg components. The Doctor also recalls a past incident where he helped the crew of the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; defeat a Cyberman infiltration of a Federation outpost in his fourth incarnation, although it would appear that this is a recent addition to his history as the Eleventh Doctor also remembers &quot;not&quot; remembering that encounter. The Cybermen attempt to subvert and take over the Borg Collective, forcing the Doctor and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to ally with the Borg to stop the Cybermen and restore the Collective to normal.

The Cybermen also feature in the Titan Comics 2016 multi-Doctor event story &quot;Supremacy of the Cybermen&quot;, which depicts the last Cybermen at the end of the universe forming an alliance with Rassilon- after he was exiled from Gallifrey by the Twelfth Doctor in &quot;Hell Bent&quot;- with the goal of conquering Gallifrey and using Time Lord energy to regenerate the universe into one under Cyber-control. Although Rassilon&#x27;s insight allows the Cybermen to conquer history and defeat all of the past Doctors, the Twelfth Doctor is able to convince Rassilon to help him after the Cybermen betray Rassilon, the two turning the Cybermens&#x27; equipment against them so that the universe is &#x27;regenerated&#x27; to a point before the Cybermen conquered Gallifrey, with only the Twelfth Doctor (and possibly Rassilon) remembering these events.

==== Video games ====
The 2010 video game &quot;Blood of the Cybermen&quot; features Cybermen of the 2006 design without the Cybus Industries chest plate. These Cybermen are unearthed in the Arctic in 2010; their ship is said to have been damaged by a time-storm and crashed 10,000 years earlier. The player plays as the Eleventh Doctor and his companion Amy, who work to defeat the Cybermen. They also appear on Telos in both the android games &quot;Doctor Who: The Mazes of Time&quot; and Doctor Who and the Dalek.

The Cybermen appear as enemies in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, and one was added as a playable character in Wave 3.

== Physical characteristics ==

While the Doctor&#x27;s archenemy, the Daleks, were on the whole unchanged during the original series&#x27;s 26-season run, the Cybermen were seen to change with almost every encounter. The Cybermen are humanoid, but have been altered until they have few remaining organic parts. They retain living human brains. In their first appearance in the series, the only parts of their bodies that still seemed human were their hands; by their next appearance in &quot;The Moonbase&quot; (1967), their bodies were entirely covered in their metallic suits, with their hands replaced by three finger claws, but they changed back to regular five-fingered hands in &quot;The Invasion&quot; (1968). As they are relatively few, the Cybermen tend towards covert activity, scheming from hiding and using human pawns or robots to act in their place until they need to appear. They also seek to increase their numbers by converting others into Cybermen (a process known as &quot;cyber-conversion&quot; or &quot;Cybernisation&quot; in the older episodes and &quot;upgrading&quot; in the newer episodes), an often painful process as body parts are removed and replaced with cybernetic replacements.

It is implied that there are still organic components beneath their suits, meaning they are cyborgs, not robots: in &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;, a Cyberman tells a group of humans that &quot;our brains are just like yours&quot;, although by the time of &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot; (1985), their brains seem to have been replaced with electronics. Also in this story, two human slave-prisoners of the Cybermen on the planet Telos, named Bates and Stratton, reveal that their organic arms and legs have been removed by the Cybermen and replaced by cyber-substitutes. In &quot;Earthshock&quot; (1982), the actors&#x27; chins were vaguely visible through a clear perspex area on the helmet to suggest some kind of organic matter. In &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; (1967), veins and brains were visible through the domed head of the Cyber-Controller, and similarly, in &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot; (2006), the Cyber-Controller&#x27;s brain is visible through the dome. The first is a Mondas Cyber Controller, and the second involves alternative Earth&#x27;s John Lumic. However, in &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; (1975), the Doctor says they are &quot;total machine creatures&quot;.

The audio play &quot;Real Time&quot; implies that the converted victim&#x27;s face remains beneath the Cyberman faceplate, although the audio plays, like all non-televised spin-off media, are of uncertain canonicity with regard to the television series. In the 2014&#x27;s &quot;Death in Heaven&quot;, Danny Pink removes the faceplate showing his face underneath. The &quot;Virgin New Adventures&quot; novel &quot;Iceberg&quot; by David Banks states that some Cybermen experience rare flashes of emotional memory from the time before they were converted; these flashes are then usually suppressed. The Cybermen in the revived series are usually constructed from human brains bonded to a Cyberman exoskeletal shell with an artificially-grown nervous system threaded throughout (&quot;The Age of Steel&quot;), although direct grafting of cyber-components is another method of conversion (&quot;Cyberwoman&quot;). In &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;, a Cyberman head is shown to open up, revealing an entire human skull, not just the brain.
Although the Cybermen often claim that they have done away with human emotion, they have exhibited emotions ranging from anger to smug satisfaction in their confrontations with the Doctor. Some Cybermen in the early stories were even given individual names such as &quot;Krang&quot; (however these names only appeared in the cast listings for &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; and were not spoken on-screen). Some parallel Earth Cybermen did retain some memories of their pre-conversion lives, although their emotional response varied. In &quot;Cyberwoman&quot;, the partial conversion led to a degree of insanity in Lisa Hallett, which was retained even after she transferred her brain into a fully human body. In &quot;Doomsday&quot;, Yvonne Hartman retains at least some elements of her personality (including her voice being heard over the usual Cyberman voice) to prevent the advance of a group of other Cybermen, and is last seen weeping what appears to be either an oil-like substance or blood. In the same episode, the Cyber-Leader expresses clear frustration at the humans&#x27; refusal to surrender, although in a later scene he criticises the Doctor for showing emotion. In &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;, the Doctor defeats the Cybermen by shutting down their emotional inhibitors, enabling them to &quot;see&quot; what had become of them. Their realisation of what they had become led them to either simply shut down out of sheer horror, or partially explode. Lastly, when the first Cyber Leader is killed, his head explodes with some white liquid leaking down his body; there are references in that episode to a patented Cybus Industries mixture of chemicals used to preserve the brain. In &quot;Death in Heaven&quot;, Danny Pink also retains some of his personality traits, including shock at seeing his reflection and what he&#x27;s become, but also his love for Clara Oswald. The Doctor turns it on to gain intelligence and reveal that the Cybermen have developed a way to cyber-convert dead human remains. Only then does the Doctor exploit Danny&#x27;s keeping of his personality traits, even under the inhibitor, to command the Cyber-Army. In &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot;, the Doctor&#x27;s companion Bill retains her complete sense of self and identity, even to the point of not initially seeing herself as a Cyberman, as a result of her experiences resisting mind control and telepathic suggestions in a past adventure. However, Cyberman program does manifest in her bursts of anger and she says her mind cannot hold on forever.

The Virgin Missing Adventures novel &quot;Killing Ground&quot;, by Steve Lyons suggests that some Cybermen imitate emotions to intimidate and unnerve their victims. The Big Finish Productions audio play &quot;Spare Parts&quot; (set on Mondas in the early days of Cyber-conversion) suggests that the Cybermen deliberately remove their emotions as part of the conversion process to stifle the physical and emotional trauma of becoming a Cyberman.

This motive behind the removal of emotions is made more explicit in &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;, where it is done by an emotional inhibitor. In that episode, deactivating their emotional inhibitors causes the converted Cybermen to realise what they have become, driving them insane and killing them.

=== Weaknesses ===

The Cybermen have had a number of weaknesses since their introduction. The most notable weakness of the original Cybermen is the element gold. Their aversion to gold was not mentioned until they try to destroy the planetoid Voga (the so-called &quot;Planet of Gold&quot;) in &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; (1975). Initially, it was explained that, due to its non-corrodible nature, gold essentially chokes their respiratory systems. For example, the glittergun, a weapon used during the Cyber-Wars in the future, fired gold dust at its targets. However, in later serials, gold appeared to affect them rather as silver affects werewolves, with gold coins or gold-tipped bullets fired at them having the same effect. The revived series&#x27;s Cybermen have no such weakness, though the tie-in website for the episode mentions it. Cybermen are also efficiently killed when shot with their own guns, or by a Dalek. Other weaknesses from early stories include solvents, gravity based technology, and excessive levels of radiation. In &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;, an EMP grenade is shown to disable a Cyberman and shut down its emotional inhibitor. The vulnerability to gold is clearly not present in some early Cyberman types, for example the type seen in the 1968 serial &quot;The Invasion&quot; were unlikely to possess it, or perhaps more likely the weakness is not known, otherwise the Doctor/UNIT would simply have used it and not needed the elaborate plan involving the assistance of a Russian missile base and the Cybermen&#x27;s puppet ally, Tobias Vaughn. In &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;, the Doctor uses gold to slow down though not destroy some circuitry of technologically advanced Cybermen in the distant future. It is unclear precisely how many of the different types, and which types, of Cyberman are vulnerable to gold.

Their armour is often depicted as flexible and resistant to bullets, but can be penetrated by gold arrows and projectiles made of gold. The Cybus Cybermen are bullet-proof and are very resilient, but are not indestructible – they are vulnerable to high explosives, electromagnetic pulses, specialised weaponry and Dalek energy weapons.

In &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; (2022), Tegan Jovanka and Ace fire gold bullets at a group of Cybermen only to be told that they have evolved beyond weakness to gold.

=== Costumes ===

For &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;, the original Cyberman costumes, including the &quot;handle&quot; shapes on their heads, were designed by Sandra Reid. The masks and one-piece bodystockings were made from jersey fabric, with holes trimmed with vinyl where the Cybermen &quot;eyes&quot; and &quot;mouths&quot; were; the actors&#x27; features were darkened to hide their faces. The fabric of the costumes were coloured a faint blue so they could show up on black and white television cameras. Over the top of the stockings, the Cybermen wore polythene suits ribbed with metal wings, along with epaulettes made of metal, and plastic piping. Their boots were short Wellington boots, painted silver. In a 2016 interview, Reid, by then going by the name Alexandra Tynan, described the motivation behind her designs was &quot;I had a planning meeting that I had to be at, and I had to have a design drawing with me. My motivation was the clock on the wall!&quot; Although the script specified the Cybermen should keep their human hands, Reid wanted them to wear gloves. However, Reid mistakenly forgot she said she would make special gloves for the Cybermen until the first day in the studio. Instead, make-up designer Gillian James hastily added silver paint to the actors&#x27; human hands. The chest units and &quot;handles&quot; were built by Shawcraft of Uxbridge. The handles were adapted from lorry headlamps, while the chest units used a lot of clear plastic and had battery-powered flashing mechanisms. The handles were intended as the housing for wires that lit up the lamps, but in a test shot the bulb exploded and the idea was dropped. Tynan explained in 2016, &quot;I indicated that there was going to be a chest unit there, but I didn&#x27;t do any designs for them, because I knew that the units were going to be a props thing.&quot;

Producer Innes Lloyd&#x27;s production team wished to update the Cybermen for &quot;The Moonbase&quot; and make them look more sophisticated and robotic. Sandra Reid designed new costumes for this serial. These were based on a one-piece silver jumpsuit made from vinyl fabric, and the Cybermen were given gloves with three-fingered hands. Their boots were lace-up army boots painted silver. Fibreglass helmets and chest units made from aluminium were built by freelance prop makers Jack and John Lovell. Silver tape was added around the eye and mouth area for emphasis, and on Reid&#x27;s instruction, the Lovells attached &quot;hydraulic joints&quot; consisting of tubing from a vacuum cleaner manufacturer and plastic practice golf balls. Costume designer Daphne Dare, consulting with Reid over the phone, took over midway through production of &quot;The Moonbase&quot; while Reid was recovering from surgery. Eight of these costumes were reused, with slight repainting and additions, for &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;, Reid&#x27;s final &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, and a new costume was built for the Cyber Controller, with a red-domed cranium built that was intended to light up, but the lighting mechanism failed.

For the filmed inserts in &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;, Martin Baugh supervised the creation of the costumes, made from a thinner one-piece material. Junction boxes, linked by steel rods, were used at the joints and near the neck to give the impression of something more technological and functional than was seen in &quot;The Moonbase&quot; and &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;. The same chest units from before were used, with the lamp at the bottom of the unit. New helmets were cast with simpler handles that extended out further from the head. These introduced a &quot;teardrop&quot; shape to the Cybermen&#x27;s eyes. An unmodified &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; suit was also used to swell the Cybermen&#x27;s numbers during the spacewalk scene, and was positioned at the back to hide the difference from the other two costumes. Mid-production, the suits were redesigned again for the more extensive recordings of &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; in the studio. Baugh&#x27;s solution was to spray-paint two padded wet suits to make them look bulkier, with the helmets, junction boxes and rods from the filmed inserts modified or removed to make the actors move more freely. The hands from the earlier &quot;Wheel in Space&quot; costumes were cut off and used as gloves for the new costumes. The chest units were turned upside down so the lamps, mounted beneath the Cybermen&#x27;s chins, could be fired as a weapon in a tighter shot.

For &quot;The Invasion&quot;, costume designer Bobi Bartlett ordered a resculpt of the helmet moulds with more head space for the actors to be done by outside company Trading Post. This included the sculpting of two large &quot;ear muffs&quot;. The helmet was made of a light fibreglass. The costumes featured army boots, and now had five-fingered gloves, rather than three. Wetsuits were reused for this serial, and a simpler and sturdier version of the chest units, with the light at the top of the unit as before, was commissioned. At each of the joints there were now domes connected by a set of ribbed rods.

While production notes in &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete History&quot; claimed that the brief appearance of a Cyberman in &quot;Carnival of Monsters&quot; consisted of a diving suit from &quot;The Invasion&quot;, Gavin Rymill in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; wrote that this Cyberman was a Cyber Controller costume from &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;. Both sources concurred that the helmet originated from &quot;The Invasion&quot;, and the back of the helmet was left unfastened.

Prue Handley was the costume designer on &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;. The costumes were built by freelance prop company Alister Bowtell, and were again based on wet suits, with rubber tubing along the arms and at the knees and elbow. The chest unit props from &quot;The Moonbase&quot; returned, and included bits of broken television sets. New, larger fibreglass helmets were made, and the costumes had silver gloves and Wellington boots.

The &quot;Earthshock&quot; designs by Dinah Collin included a set of Mk 2C RAF flight suits with built-in pipes used to pump cool air around. The &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; head was reshaped and recut by Richard Gregory of the freelance company Imagineering to add more details. There was a transparent section in the face through where the actor&#x27;s moving jaw could be seen. New chest units were made in fibreglass, and they were decorated with ammunition trays. Also worn with the costumes were padded zip-back gloves and Tecnica Moon Boots. For &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;, the jaw area was sprayed silver, and less ostentatious boots were worn. Anushia Nieradzik was the costume designer on &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;. A specially modified Cyber Controller costume with a tall silver dome on its head was made for &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;; as with the Controller costume used in &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;, its helmet had no handles. For &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot;, the same head and chest pieces returned with a dappled plastic jaw and the removal of the ammunition trays. A plainer type of flight suit without built-in pipes was used for the bodies, and cable junction boxes with plastic tubes were added to the limbs for more detail. The costumes had cricket gloves sprayed silver, and Dr. Martens boots.

The redesign of the Cybermen in &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot; was a month-long process involving nearly every part of the design team. The production team decided on an Art Deco approach, and the final design was handed to Neill Gorton&#x27;s team at Millennium FX, who also built the final costumes. The head was designed to be able to be turned independently from the body; such movement had not been possible in previous helmets. Millennium&#x27;s Martin Rezard was the lead sculptor of a full-sized clay Cyberman, from which moulds were taken to create over forty fibreglass pieces to make up the head and body of each costume. Powdered aluminium was added to the final layer of the fibreglass, and each component was hand polished until it gleamed. Each of the fibreglass pieces were clipped onto a basic Lycra suit assembled by Jo Glover. The gloves and neck were cast in a soft silver-tinted silicone by Helen Rowe and Alex Whathey. Ten Cyberman costumes were made, including the Cyber Controller, which had a visible brain and pipes connecting him to his life support systems. In &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot; the costumes no longer had the Cybus Industries &quot;C&quot; logo introduced in &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot;.

The sleeker and more elegant design introduced in &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot; was made by the Millennium FX team from flexible polyurethane rubber, painted to look metallic using a new process originally developed for use in the car industry.

The &quot;Mondasian Cybermen&quot; in &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; and &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot; were created by the Millennium FX team, and were an updated version of Sandra Reid&#x27;s 1966 design of the Cybermen for &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;. The Chest units and helmets and other like attachments were moulded and constructed by Millennium FX. The costumes themselves were built from a silver latex fabric by costume designer Robin Archer. The Cybermen&#x27;s hands were covered by rubber gloves. Millennium also created the transitional &quot;patients&quot; that evolve into Cybermen from the two-parter. Despite the &quot;Tenth Planet&quot; Cybermen not having gloves, director Rachel Talalay said that the reason for adding them to the Mondasian Cybermen in the series 10 two-part finale was &quot;partially an issue because of skintone&quot; with Pearl Mackie&#x27;s Cyberman, but also to &quot;get a scarier feel and something more artificial by putting the gloves on them&quot;. She further explained that in &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; it was hard to tell if they had skintone gloves or not to justify their addition.

Unlike the Doctor&#x27;s other foes, the Cybermen costumes have changed substantially in appearance over the years, looking more and more modern, although retaining certain commonalities of design, the most iconic being the &quot;handles&quot; attached to Cybermen heads. Other design elements include their round eyeholes and their chest units.

Aside from these changes, variations in design between rank-and-file Cybermen and their leaders have been seen. In &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; and &quot;The Invasion&quot; (both 1968), the Cyber Director was depicted as an immobile mechanism. The Cyber Leader in &quot;The Next Doctor&quot; sports a transparent brain casing.

Because the Doctor is a time traveller, he meets the Cybermen at various points in their history out of sequence from the order the serials were made. This can be confusing since Cybermen from serials set in &quot;earlier&quot; periods of history can sometimes look more sophisticated than those from &quot;later&quot; periods. Lawrence Miles suggests in his reference work &quot;About Time 5&quot; that the anachronistically designed Cybermen of &quot;Earthshock&quot; and &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot; are time travellers, like those in &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;. The Doctor Who Role Playing Game &quot;Cyber Files&quot; worked around the contradiction by stating that in &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;, the oldest designs of Cybermen were used for the attack while the later more sophisticated models remained on Mondas.

The &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode &quot;Cyberwoman&quot; features a partially cyber-converted woman who lacks the outer plating of a fully converted Cyberman. Her body is encased in metal structures but much of her flesh, including her face, is visible. She also has clearly visible metallic breasts, though it is not clear how much of her own flesh has been replaced and how much is merely covered. Another character speculates she could be 40–45% human, and 55–60% Cyberman.

=== Voice ===

Early Cybermen had an unsettling, sing-song voice, provided by Roy Skelton, constructed by placing the inflections of words on the wrong syllables. In their first appearance, the effect of this was augmented by having a Cyberman abruptly open his mouth wide and keep it open, without moving his tongue or lips, while the separately recorded voice would be playing, and then shut it quickly when the line was finished. Although the cloth-like masks of the first Cybermen were soon replaced by a full helmet, a similar physical effect involving the mouth &quot;hatch&quot; opening and then shutting when the line was finished was used until &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; (1968).

Later, the production team used special effects from its Radiophonic Workshop by adding first a mechanical larynx used by Peter Hawkins, then a vocoder, to modify speech to make it sound more artificial. In later stories of the original series and in the audio plays, two copies of the voice track were sampled and pitch-shifted downwards by differing amounts and layered to produce the effect, sometimes with the addition of a small amount of flanging. From &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; to &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot; (1988) the actors provided the voices themselves, using microphones and transmitters in the chest units.

The voices for the 2006 return of the Cybermen are similar to the buzzing electronic monotone voices of the Cybermen used in &quot;The Invasion&quot;. They were provided by Nicholas Briggs. As shown in the second series of &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;, the timbre was created by processing Briggs&#x27; voice through a Moog moogerfooger ring modulator. Unusually, in &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;, the Cyber-Controller (John Lumic, played by Roger Lloyd-Pack) retains his voice after being upgraded, but it is still electronic. In &quot;Doomsday&quot;, a Cyberman which contains the brain of Torchwood Institute director Yvonne Hartman retains a female-sounding though still electronic voice, as does the partially converted Lisa Hallett in &quot;Cyberwoman&quot; when her Cyberman personality is dominant. In an effect reminiscent of the earliest Cybermen&#x27;s mouths snapping open while speaking, the new Cybermen have a blue light in their &quot;mouths&quot; (or &quot;teeth&quot;) which illuminates in synchronisation with their speech.

Since &quot;The Next Doctor&quot; in 2008, the Cybermen have had nasally-sounding electronic voices; this continued all the way until &quot;Closing Time&quot; in 2011. Between the 2013 episode &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot; and 2017 episode &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot;, the Cybermen (continuing to be voiced by Briggs) now have deep, almost growl-like voices. Their mouths retain a blue light-up effect but flicker luminously instead of staying lit as opposed to the 2006 design.

The Patients in &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; (Pre Mondasian Cybermen) communicated through speech synthesis keyboards, similar to those used in hospitals for people unable to talk normally or use their vocal cords. These voices were disturbing in that they almost &#x27;replicated&#x27; actual human speech, but with stilted delivery

== Variants ==
Some Cybermen are given titles, being credited as &quot;Cyber Leader&quot; (or variants thereof), &quot;Cyber Lieutenant&quot;, &quot;Cyber Scout&quot; or the &quot;Cyber Controller&quot;. The Cyber Leader is usually depicted as a Cyberman with black handles.

An immobile computer, referred to as the &quot;Cyber Planner&quot;, appears in &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; and &quot;The Invasion&quot;. A Cyber Planner also takes over the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s body in &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;.

The original Controller is seen (and destroyed) in two serials, &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;, and in each may or may not be the same consciousness in different bodies; it appears to recognise and remember the Doctor from previous encounters. In the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Iceberg&quot;, the first Cyber Controller is created by implanting a Cyber Director, or Cyber Planner, into the skull of a recently converted Cyberman.

The parallel universe Cyber Controller in &quot;The Age of Steel&quot; uses the brain of John Lumic, the creator of the Cybermen in that parallel reality.

In &quot;Doomsday&quot;, a Cyber Leader appears, and when he is destroyed, mention is made of downloading his data files into another Cyberman unit, which is then upgraded to Cyber Leader.

The 2008 Christmas special, &quot;The Next Doctor&quot;, featured a new, more agile variant called a Cybershade. The Doctor theorises that it is a more primitive version of a Cyberman, using the brain of a cat, and they physically resemble animals as they cannot speak and walk on all fours. In the same story a &quot;Cyber-King&quot; appears; according to the Doctor, it is a &quot;Dreadnought-class&quot; ship for use in invasions resembling a Cyberman hundreds of feet tall, and contains a Cyber-factory in its chest. It is controlled from within its mouth. Its right arm can be converted into a cannon, and its left into a laser.

&quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; introduced a unique prototype Cyberman that was made of wood to avoid detection by the Church of the Papal Mainframe and equipped with blowtorches.

After Bill Potts is wounded on the bridge of a Mondasian colony ship, and taken down the ship&#x27;s lifts to be surgically repaired, she encounters half converted Mondasians referred to only as &#x27;The Patients&#x27;. They wore grey surgical robes and their faces were entirely covered with cloth bags, save for a nasal canula that administered fluids and all were hooked up to IV drips. Most remained stationary; reliant on wheelchairs in the &quot;out ward&quot; while some walked the hospital grounds; being prepped for additional surgery and rounding up humans in the city and leading them to the hospital. During the early stages of these experiments (a precursor to cyber-conversion), The Patients were shown to feel the pain caused by this process, with some even begging for death, twisting in their chairs and jabbing at their speech keyboards. They were capable of attacking, following commands (such as restraining Bill) and possessed great strength. They could be incapacitated, though not killed by gunfire.

In &quot;Ascension of the Cybermen&quot; (2020), Cyber Warriors are introduced who are a &quot;Warrior Class&quot; of Cyberman. Their armour is specifically designed in a medieval way, giving the appearance of a medieval warrior. The chest is that of a 2013 Cyberman but with less detail, while their helmets bear a resemblance to the Cybermen from &quot;The Invasion&quot;. They also have small energy cannons on their wrists. In the following episode &quot;The Timeless Children&quot;, the Master creates the &quot;Cyber Masters&quot;, a new breed created from Cyberium and Time Lord corpses. These Cybermen, while resembling the Cyber-Warriors, have Time Lord apparel built into their armour, such as their headdresses. These Cybermen were loyal to the Master, and had the ability to regenerate, making them a potentially unstoppable threat. They also appeared in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; with updated designs.

== Technology ==
Cybermen technology is almost completely oriented towards weaponry, apart from their own bodies. When originally seen in &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;, they had large energy weapons that attached to their chests. In &quot;The Moonbase&quot;, the Cybermen had two types of weaponry: an electrical discharge from their hands, which stunned the target, and a type of gun. They also made use of a large laser cannon with which they attempted to attack the base itself.

The hand discharge was also present in &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;, which featured a smaller, hand-held Cyber-weapon shaped like a pistol that was described as an X-ray laser. In &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;, the Cybermen could use the discharge to also operate machinery, and had death rays built into their chest units. They displayed the same units in &quot;The Invasion&quot; as well as carrying large rifles for medium distance combat. In &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; and the audio play &quot;Real Time&quot;, their weapons were built into their helmets. &quot;Killing Ground&quot; indicates that this type of Cybermen also have more powerful hand weapons. Subsequent appearances have shown them armed almost exclusively with hand-held gun-style weapons.

The Cybermen have access to weapons of mass destruction known as cobalt bombs, also sometimes as Cyber-bombs, which were banned by the galactic Armageddon Convention (&quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;). A &quot;Cyber-megatron bomb&quot; was mentioned in &quot;The Invasion&quot;, supposedly powerful enough to destroy all life on Earth. In &quot;Earthshock&quot;, the Cybermen also used android drones as part of their plans to invade Earth.

The revived programme Cybermen electrocute their victims by touching them and at first carried no other weaponry. In &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Doomsday&quot;, the Cybermen are equipped with retractable energy weapons housed within their forearms (these were actually first shown in &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;, but only very briefly and were not used during that episode), but also use advanced human weapons to battle the Daleks. The arm mounted guns prove effective against humans but are unable to penetrate Dalek shields. Two Cybermen sent to parley with Dalek Thay at the Battle of Canary Wharf shot the Dalek but were promptly exterminated. In the &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode &quot;Cyberwoman&quot;, the partially converted Lisa Hallett used her electrical touch against the Torchwood team, as well as an energy beam fired from her arm which could only stun the part of the body at which it was aimed. In &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;, the Cybermen again have the wrist-blaster, but also regain the modified human weapons. In &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;, the Cybermen have the ability to move at a warp-like speed. At this speed they appear as blurry after images. Cyberman had also overcome the weakness of solely being able to convert human-like species; the Doctor had been safe from being in danger of conversion until this point.

The Mondasian Cybermen from The Tenth Planet were updated for the Series 10 Finale. As opposed to shooting from their chest pieces they used their lanterns as weapons. This was in the Novelisation for The Tenth Planet. They also had the ability to emit electricity.

=== Cybermat ===

The Cybermen also use smaller, cybernetic creatures called &quot;cybermats&quot; as weapons of attack. In their first appearance in &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;, they resembled oversized metallic silverfish and had segmented bodies with hair-like tactile sensor probes along the base of their heads, which were topped with crystalline eyes. The Second Doctor described them as a &quot;form of metallic life,&quot; implying that they may be semi-organic like the Cybermen, and that they too attack by feeding off brain waves. They were defeated using electricity.

The second model of Cybermat seen in &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; was used for sabotage, able to tune in on human brainwaves. They were carried to the &quot;Wheel&quot; in small but high-density sacs that sank through the hull of the space station, causing drops in air pressure. These Cybermats had solid photoreceptors for eyes instead of crystals. The Second Doctor used an audio frequency to jam them, causing them to spin, crash and disintegrate.

The third model, seen in &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;, was a much larger, snake-like cybermat that could be remotely controlled and could inject poison into its victims. It had no visible eyes or other features, and was as vulnerable to gold dust as the Cybermen were.

The original model was later mentioned in a conversation between the Doctor and his double during &quot;The Rebel Flesh&quot;, reaffirming that that model of Cybermat killed by feeding on brainwaves.

The fourth model of cybermat appears for the first time in the revived series in the 2011 episode &quot;Closing Time&quot;, where it is shown to have an organic mouth full of sharp teeth, and transmits power to a crashed cyber-ship.

In the audio play &quot;Spare Parts&quot;, &quot;mats&quot; are cybernetically augmented creatures, sometimes kept as pets. Cybermats of a different design are used for surveillance by Mondas&#x27; Central Committee. The creatures occasionally go wild, chewing on power sources, and must be rounded up by a &quot;mat-catcher.&quot; In the Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Illegal Alien&quot; by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry, set in the 1940s, the Cybermen create cybermats by cyber-converting local animals like cats or birds, possibly because of lack of technological resources.

In the Bernice Summerfield audio adventure &quot;The Crystal of Cantus&quot;, a Cyberman reveals that the organs of children who are too small to be fully cyber-converted are used in the creation of cybermats.

The cybermats appeared in the video game &quot;Blood of the Cybermen&quot; where instead of killing, they turned individuals into . The slaves have mostly human bodies, but have Cyberman heads and arms. The Cybermen see the as inferior, and delete them once they have served their purpose.

An upgraded form of cybermats, referred to as , appeared in &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;. They were incredibly small mechanical insects that were more versatile and were able to partially convert other lifeforms into Cybermen.

<doc id="229470" wikidata="Q285132" url="?curid=229470" title="Haikouichthys">
<text>Haikouichthys is an extinct genus of craniate (animals with notochords and distinct heads) that lived 518 million years ago, during the Cambrian explosion of multicellular life. The type species, Haikouichthys ercaicunensis, was first described in 1999. &quot;Haikouichthys&quot; had a defined skull and other characteristics that have led paleontologists to label it a true craniate, and even to be popularly characterized as one of the earliest fishes. More than 500 specimens were referred to this taxon and phylogenetic analyses indicates that the animal is probably a basal stem-craniate. Some researchers have considered &quot;Haikouichthys&quot; to be synonymous with the other primitive chordate &quot;Myllokunmingia&quot;, but subsequent studies led by the British paleontologist Simon Conway Morris identified both genera to be distinct, separate taxa on the basis of different gill arrangement, the absence of branchial rays in &quot;Myllokunmingia&quot; and the myomeres having a more acute shape in &quot;Haikouichthys&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Haikouichthys&quot; is about long and is narrower than &quot;Myllokunmingia&quot;, another chordate that comes from the same beds. The holotype of &quot;Haikouichthys ercaicunensis&quot; was found in the Yuanshan member of the Qiongzhusi Formation in the &#x27;Eoredlichia&#x27; Zone near Ercai Village in the Haikou Subdistrict (not to be confused with the city of Haikou in Hainan) of Xishan, Kunming, hence its name, which means &quot;Haikou fish from Ercaicun&quot;. The fossil was recovered among the Chengjiang fauna, in one of a series of Lagerstätten sites where thousands of exquisitely preserved soft-bodied fossils have already been found. Following the discovery of the holotype, additional Lower Cambrian fossils of &quot;Haikouichthys ercaicunensis&quot; have been discovered. 
Researchers have identified eyes, cranial cartilages, at least six to nine gill arches, possible nasal sacs and otic capsules from its head. It is likely that the brain of &quot;Haikouichthys&quot; had the same major brain divisions found in extant vertebrates. The describers of this taxon initially reported its potential notochord, though some researchers consider this claim to be uncertain. Still, numerous segments (myomeres) with rear directed chevrons in the tail indicate that &quot;Haikouichthys&quot; was indeed a chordate, and complete dorsal, ventral and caudal fins were also found in its specimens. The fin radials of &quot;Haikouichthys&quot; show similarity to those of hagfish and lampreys, and they seem to angle &quot;forward&quot; toward the end thought on the basis of internal structures to be the head. There are 13 circular structures along the bottom that may be gonads, slime organs, or something else entirely.

<doc id="229473" wikidata="Q12969145" url="?curid=229473" title="President of Argentina">
<text>The president of Argentina (; officially known as the president of the Argentine Nation ) is both head of state and head of government of Argentina. Under the national constitution, the president is also the chief executive of the federal government and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

Throughout Argentine history, the office of head of state has undergone many changes, both in its title as in its features and powers. The current president Javier Milei was sworn into office on 10 December 2023. He succeeded Alberto Fernández. 

The constitution of Argentina, along with several constitutional amendments, establishes the requirements, powers, and responsibilities of the president, the term of office and the method of election.

==History==
The origins of Argentina as a nation can be traced to 1776, when it was separated by King Charles III of Spain from the existing Viceroyalty of Peru, creating the new Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. The head of state continued to be the king, but he was represented locally by the viceroy. These viceroys were seldom natives of the country.

By the 18-25 May Revolution in 1810, the first Argentine autonomous government, known as the &quot;Primera Junta&quot;, was formed in Buenos Aires. It was later known as the &quot;Junta Grande&quot; when representatives from the provinces joined. These early attempts at self-government were succeeded by two Triumvirates and, although the first &quot;juntas&quot; had presidents, the king of Spain was still regarded as head of state.

Executive power was still not in the hands of a single person until the position of supreme director was created by the 1813 National Assembly. In 1817, Congress declared independence and composed a constitution. This established the Supreme Director as head of state and vested the position with presidential powers. This constitution gave the supreme director the power of appointing governors of the provinces. Owing to political circumstances, this constitution never came into force, and the central power was dissolved, leaving the country as a federation of provinces.

A new constitution was drafted in 1826. This constitution was the first to create a president, although this office retained the powers described in the 1816 constitution. This constitution did come into force, resulting in the election of the first president, Bernardino Rivadavia. Because of the Cisplatine War, Rivadavia resigned after a short time, and the office was dissolved shortly thereafter.

A civil war between &quot;unitarios&quot; (unitarians, i.e. Buenos Aires centralists) and federalists ensued in the following decades. At this time, there was no central authority, and the closest to that was the chairman of foreign relations, typically the governor of the province of Buenos Aires. The last to bear this title was Juan Manuel de Rosas, who in the last years of his governorship was elected Supreme Chief of the Confederation, gaining effective rule of the rest of the country.

In 1852, Rosas was deposed, and a constitutional convention was summoned. This constitution, still in force, established a national federal government, with the office of president. The term was fixed as six years, with no possibility of reelection. The first elected president under the constitution was Justo José de Urquiza, but Buenos Aires seceded from the Argentine Confederation as the State of Buenos Aires. Bartolomé Mitre was the first president of the unified country, when Buenos Aires rejoined the confederation. Thus, Rivadavia, Urquiza, and Mitre are considered the first presidents of Argentina by different historians: Rivadavia for being the first one to use the title, Urquiza for being the first one to rule under the 1853 constitution, and Mitre for being the first president of Argentina under its current national limits.

In 1930, 1943, 1955, 1962, 1966, and 1976, military coups deposed elected presidents. In 1966 and 1976, the federal government was undertaken by a military junta, where power was shared by the chiefs of the armed forces. In 1962, the president of the Senate ruled, but in the other cases, a military chief assumed the title of president.

It is debatable whether these military presidents can properly be called presidents, as there are issues with the legitimacy of their governments. The position of the current Argentine government is that military presidents Jorge Rafael Videla and Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri were explicitly &quot;not&quot; legitimate presidents. They and their immediate successors were denied the right to a presidential pension after the conclusion of their terms. The status of earlier military presidents, however, remains more uncertain.

==Powers and duties==
The president of the nation has the following powers granted by Constitution (Article 99):

* Is the supreme head of the nation, head of government and is politically responsible for the general administration of the country.
* Issues the instructions and regulations necessary for the execution of the laws of the nation, without altering their spirit with regulatory exceptions.
* Participates in the making of laws under the Constitution, promulgates them and has them published. The Executive Power shall in no case under penalty, and void, issue legislative provisions. Only when exceptional circumstances make it impossible to follow the ordinary procedures foreseen by this Constitution for the enactment of laws, and not try to rules governing criminal matters, taxation, electoral or political party regime, may issue decrees on grounds of necessity and urgency, which will be decided by a general agreement of ministers who shall countersign them together with the head of the cabinet of ministers. The head personally and within ten days submit the decision to the consideration of the Joint Standing Committee, whose composition proportion of the political representation of each chamber. This commission shall submit its report within ten days to the plenary of each House for its specific treatment, they immediately considered the Chambers. A special law enacted with the absolute majority of all the members of each House shall regulate the procedure and scope of Congress intervention.
* Appoints the judges of the Supreme Court with the Senate by two-thirds of the members present, at a public meeting convened for that purpose. Appoints the other judges of the lower federal courts according to a binding three candidates proposed by the Judiciary Council, with the Senate, in public session, in which the suitability of candidates will be considered. A new appointment, the same consent, it is necessary to keep in under any of those judges, once they reach the age of seventy-five years. All appointments of judges whose age is indicated or over shall be five years and maybe repeated indefinitely, by the same procedure.
* May grant pardons or commute sentences for crimes subject to federal jurisdiction, following a report of the court, except in cases of impeachment by the House of Representatives.
* Grant pensions, retirements, pensions and licenses under the laws of the Nation.
* Appoints and removes ambassadors, ministers plenipotentiary and business with the Senate; alone appoints and removes the chief of cabinet ministers and other cabinet ministers, the officers of his Secretariat, consular agents and employees whose appointments are not otherwise regulated by this Constitution.
* Is the commander in chief of all of the armed forces of the nation and thus is the highest-ranked officer.
* Annually attends the opening session of the Congress, both Houses assembled for this purpose, this time realising the state of the Nation, on amendments promised by the Constitution, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.
* Attends regular sessions of Congress, or convokes extraordinary sessions when a serious interest order or progress requires.
* Oversees the performance of the duties of the chief of the Ministerial Cabinet as regards the collection of the revenues of the Nation and its investment in accordance with the law or budget of national expenditures.
* Traditionally, the president is the godfather of the seventh sons or the seventh daughters. This tradition came from Imperial Russia and became law in 1974. A similar tradition is attached to the king and queen of the Belgians.

==Features of the office==
===Requirements===
Article 89 of the Constitution detail the requirements:

Sections 94 to 98 detail the electoral requirements. A modified two-round system, or ballotage, is used (Section 94). Unlike in most countries using a two-round system, presidential candidates in Argentina do not need to win a majority of the vote to win the presidency in a single round. To win the election in the first round, the winning candidate&#x27;s party must receive either more than 45 percent of so-called &quot;positive votes&quot;, or &quot;votos positivos&quot; (Section 97) or at least 40 percent of positive votes and be more than 10 percentage points ahead of the next most-voted candidate (Section 98). Positive votes are valid votes cast for any of the candidates, leaving out of the count blank and spoiled ballots.

If no candidate obtains the necessary votes to win in the first round, then the two candidates with the most votes compete in the second round, held two weeks later, when the candidate with the most votes in that round is elected president.

===Term duration===
Under the 1994 constitutional amendment, the president serves for four years, with a possibility of immediate reelection for one more term. A president who has served two consecutive terms may be elected again after an interval of one term. There is no limit on how many times a candidate may seek the presidency if they are unsuccessful. The same rules apply, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, to the vice presidency of Argentina.

Under the constitution of 1853, the president served for six years, with no possibility of consecutive reelection. In 1949, the constitution was amended to allow the president to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. This provision was repealed in 1957. After the 1966 military coup d&#x27;état, the regime shortened the presidential term to four years. However, political instability led to frequent turnovers in office. With the restoration of democracy in 1983, the term was restored to six years.

Prior to the 1994 constitutional reform, the president and vice president were required to be Roman Catholics. This stipulation was abolished in 1994.

==Compensation and privileges of office==
As of 2015, the president and vice president enjoy a salary paid by the national treasury, which cannot be altered during the period of their appointment. During the same period, they may not hold any other office nor receive any other emolument from the nation or from any province. The president&#x27;s salary is $131,421 Argentine pesos per month.
The &quot;Casa Rosada&quot; in Buenos Aires is the official workplace of the president and the &quot;Quinta de Olivos&quot; their official residence. The president is entitled to use its staff and facilities. It has a summer residence in the town of Chapadmalal, in Buenos Aires Province, which is called the Presidential Unit Chapadmalal. The Presidential Guard is responsible for the security of the entire presidential family.

To move the president uses aircraft that are part of the Presidential Air Group:

The main aircraft was a Boeing 757 known as Tango 01 after its military registry: &quot;T-01&quot; (the &quot;T&quot; stands for &quot;Transport&quot;, although it is fortuitously pronounced &quot;Tango&quot;, as in the Argentine national dance, in the NATO alphabet). The 757 entered the service in 1995 replacing the former T-01, a Boeing 707. The aircraft was nicknamed Virgen de Luján after Argentina&#x27;s patron saint. The Tango 01 was defunct in 2016 and eventually replaced in 2023 by a Boeing 757-200 in VIP design, designated ARG-01.

The current presidential fleet also includes two Fokker F28 (T-02 and T-03) (one always in service) and Learjet 60 (T-10). The Learjet is also used by the Air Force chief of staff.

As helicopters, a Sikorsky S-70 (H-01pic) and two Sikorsky S-76 (H-02pic and H-03pic) also make-up the fleet, with an additional Air Force Bell 212, as needed. During Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández administration AAP used different aircraft for their global flights, most notably Boeing 747 loaned from Aerolíneas Argentinas and a private Bombardier Global 5000.


== &quot;De facto&quot; governments ==

Following military coups that overthrew the constitutional government were &quot;de facto&quot; military presidents in 1930–1932, 1943–1946, 1955–1958, 1966–1973 and 1976–1983 that brought in addition to the powers of the president also corresponding to Congress. The subsequent analysis of the validity of their actions led to the subsequent formulation of the doctrine of &quot;de facto&quot; governments.

That doctrine was nullified by the constitutional reform of 1994, which added Article 36 (see below).

Article 29 of the constitution of 1853 had an article that considered the usurpation of public power as &#x27;treason&#x27;, but was referred to the &quot;de jure&quot; rulers. For this reason the constitutional reform of 1994 included Article 36 which says:

:&quot;Article 36. This Constitution shall rule even when its observance is interrupted by acts of force against the institutional order and the democratic system. These acts shall be irreparably null.

:&quot;Their authors shall be punished with the penalty foreseen in Section 29, disqualified in perpetuity from holding public offices and excluded from the benefits of pardon and commutation of sentences.

:&quot;Those who, as a consequence of these acts, were to assume the powers foreseen for the authorities of this Constitution or for those of the provinces, shall be punished with the same penalties and shall be civil and criminally liable for their acts. The respective actions shall not be subject to prescription.

:&quot;All citizens shall have the right to oppose resistance to those committing the acts of force stated in this section.

:&quot;He who, procuring personal enrichment, incurs in serious fraudulent offence against the Nation shall also attempt against the democratic system, and shall be disqualified to hold public office for the term specified by law.

:&quot;Congress shall enact a law on public ethics which shall rule the exercise of public office.&quot;

In summary, the article states:

* Absolute nullity of the acts issued by the government installed by force;
* The authors shall be punished as traitors;
* These crimes are barred and the authors can not receive the benefit of the amnesty;
* Every citizen has the right to resistance against these acts of force.

== Line of succession ==
===Vice president===
The office of vice president was established by the 1853 constitution for the purpose of providing a succession in case the president is unable to complete their term via death, resignation, or removal from office. The Argentine constitution (art. 88) entitles the vice president to exercise the duties of the president, both in the case of a temporary absence and in the case of a permanent absence for health reasons.

===Further succession===

In the absence of both the president and the vice president, the succession is regulated by the Law 20,972 (&quot;Acephaly Law&quot;). It provides that the executive power must be temporarily exercised (without assuming the title of president) by the provisional president of the Senate; in his or her absence, by the president of the Chamber of Deputies; and in the absence of both, by the president of the Supreme Court.

In case of the permanent absence of both the president and the vice president, due to resignation, death, or removal, the Constitution (art. 88) entitles the National Congress Assembled to select a new president from among the current senators, deputies and governors, within the following two days of the death or resignation of the former president.

<text>The is a Japanese Cabinet Office commission. It is headquartered in the 2nd Building of the Central Common Government Office at 2-1-2 Kasumigaseki in Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda, Tokyo.

The commission consists of a chairperson who holds the rank of Minister of State and five other members appointed by the prime minister, with consent of both houses of the Diet. The commission operates independently of the cabinet, but coordinates with it through the Minister of State.

The commission&#x27;s function is to guarantee the neutrality of the police system by insulating the force from political pressure and ensuring the maintenance of democratic methods in police administration. It administers the National Police Agency, and has the authority to appoint or dismiss senior police officers.

==History==
The Japanese government established a European-style civil police system in 1874, under the centralized control of the Police Bureau within the Home Ministry, to put down internal disturbances and maintain order during the Meiji Restoration. By the 1880s, the police had developed into a nationwide instrument of government control, providing support for local leaders and enforcing public morality. They acted as general civil administrators, implementing official policies and thereby facilitating unification and modernization. In rural areas especially, the police had great authority and were accorded the same mixture of fear and respect as the village head. Their increasing involvement in political affairs was one of the foundations of the authoritarian state in Japan in the first half of the twentieth century.

The centralized police system steadily acquired responsibilities, until it controlled almost all aspects of daily life, including fire prevention and mediation of labor disputes. The system regulated public health, business, factories, and construction, and it issued permits and licenses. The Peace Preservation Law of 1925 gave police the authority to arrest people for &quot;wrong thoughts&quot;. Special Higher Police were created to regulate the content of motion pictures, political meetings, and election campaigns. Military police operating under the army and navy and the justice and home ministries aided the civilian police in limiting proscribed political activity. After the Manchurian Incident of 1931, military police assumed greater authority, leading to friction with their civilian counterparts. After 1937 police directed business activities for the war effort, mobilized labor, and controlled transportation.

After Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945, occupation authorities retained the prewar police structure until a new system was implemented and the Diet passed the 1947 Police Law. Contrary to Japanese proposals for a strong, centralized force to deal with postwar unrestbut in line with the thinking of American police reformers on the same subjectthe police system was decentralized. About 1,600 independent municipal forces were established in cities, towns, and villages with 5,000 inhabitants or more, and a National Rural Police was organized by prefecture. Civilian control was to be ensured by placing the police under the jurisdiction of public safety commissions controlled by the National Public Safety Commission in the Office of the Prime Minister. The Home Ministry was abolished and replaced by the less powerful Ministry of Home Affairs, and the police were stripped of their responsibility for fire protection, public health, and other administrative duties.

When most of the occupation forces were transferred to Korea in 1950–51, the 75,000 strong National Police Reserve was formed to back up the ordinary police during civil disturbances, and pressure mounted for a centralized system more compatible with Japanese political preferences. The 1947 Police Law was amended in 1951 to allow the municipal police of smaller communities to merge with the National Rural Police. Most chose this arrangement, and by 1954 only about 400 cities, towns, and villages still had their own police forces. Under the 1954 amended Police Law, a final restructuring created an even more centralized system in which local forces were organized by prefectures under a National Police Agency.

The revised Police Law of 1954, still in effect in the 1990s, preserves some strong points of the postwar system, particularly measures ensuring civilian control and political neutrality, while allowing for increased centralization. The National Public Safety Commission system has been retained. State responsibility for maintaining public order has been clarified to include coordination of national and local efforts; centralization of police information, communications, and record keeping facilities; and national standards for training, uniforms, pay, rank, and promotion. Rural and municipal forces were abolished and integrated into prefectural forces, which handled basic police matters. Officials and inspectors in various ministries and agencies continue to exercise special police functions assigned to them in the 1947 Police Law.

<doc id="229490" wikidata="Q498508" url="?curid=229490" title="Law enforcement in South Korea">
<text>South Korea has a relatively unified and integrated approach to law enforcement. For example, the National Police Agency (NPA) provides all general policing services throughout the country. Due to the unitary system, local police organizations are directly under the NPA.

This differs from the situation in many countries such as France, where policing is split between the National Police and &quot;Gendarmerie&quot;, or the United States, which has a layered system of federal, state, and/or local law enforcement organizations.

However, South Korea has several independent agencies that only enforce a specific law or laws—for example, the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Economy and Finance have their own enforcement organizations for either border control, Customs or taxation, respectively.

== History ==

=== Before the Koryo era ===
Before the Koryo era, there were many records about criminal law, but there were no accurate records about the police. Some people speculate that there is no complete differentiation with government organizations or military organizations.

=== Korean era ===
There was the Anti-Criminal Department (an ancient judicial department) in Korea, and a ACD captain was appointed to take charge of police affairs. In 1835, the organization was expanded to the left and right Anti-Criminal Department. In 1884, the Left and Right Podo Offices were abolished, and the police department was newly established to take charge of public order within the capital. Local police affairs were managed from within.

=== Korean Empire ===
The modern police system was introduced before and after the establishment of Korean Empire in 1897. In 1899, the police chief was promoted to the position of police minister, who was in charge of public security work throughout the country. In 1901, it was reorganized into an internal police department, and the interior minister was in charge of police work.

=== Japanese imperialist occupation period ===
In the 1910s, during the Japanese imperialist occupation, the police organization was directly under the authority of the deputy governor of the Joseon Colonies. The central government had a police inspector general&#x27;s department and local police departments. Police Superintendent The military police commander, who is not interfered by the Japanese military police commander, also serves as the police superintendent, supervising the police work on the Korean Peninsula. The Ministry of Police Supervision directly governs the Ministry of Beijing.

The provincial police ministers are concurrently the provincial gendarmerie captains, who are responsible for the police affairs in their provinces. The chief of police is responsible for the police affairs of military units, but the sub-captains of military police and sub-captains of military police have the same authority as the chief of police, and are responsible for areas beyond the authority of the chief of police. The cotton unit has a pure social finance office, a pure social police station, a military police dispatch office and a military police business office to assist police affairs. Generally, the police are deployed in areas that mainly need to maintain order, such as the port of departure, while the military police are deployed in important military places or border areas, where there are militia.

In the 1920s, during the Japanese occupation, the police organization changed from military police to ordinary police. The General Police Supervision Department and the provincial police departments were abolished, and the police departments under the provincial governor exercised police power. At the same time of setting up military police detachment or military police detachment, police stations are also set up in areas where there are no police stations, and the principle of setting up a police station in a department or county and a resident station on one side is formulated. With the need for more policemen, a police training workshop was set up.

To carry out Japan&#x27;s war of aggression, the control of the Korean Peninsula was strengthened, and the police organization was also expanded. The police were responsible for national defense, air defense, economic control, listening to the public&#x27;s trends, media guidance and national health care, which lasted until the liberation of the Korean Peninsula.

The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea established by the March 1st Movement in 1919 is a police bureau under the Ministry of the Interior which performs police functions. The first police chief was recommended by Interior Minister An Changhao, and Jin Jiu was elected on 12 August 1919. The police bureau was responsible for intelligence and supervision, police work, and arrested Japanese imperialist spies. Jin Jiu appointed Lu Shungen as the guard minister, and employed most young Han people, including more than 20 guards. Jin Jiu not only supervised the police work as the police chief, but also tried as the presiding judge in the interim government without courts. Jin Jiu, the police chief, expelled Sun Yujia and Jiang Linyu, who had been a spy of Japanese imperialism, shot and killed Jin Daoshun, who had been a spy of Japanese consulate, and arrested and executed Huang Heshan, who tried to poison independence activists.

=== Republic of Korea era ===

After liberation on August 15, 1945, the Police Department was established in the US Military Government and the police departments were established in each province on October 21. In 1946, the Police Department was reorganized into the Police Department, and each provincial police department was reorganized into the provincial police office, and the Railway Provincial Police Agency was established. In September 1948, police authority was transferred from the US Military Government to the Korean government, and as the National Security Bureau was established under the Ministry of Home Affairs, each city and provincial police office was changed to the National Police Agency.

In 1949, the Railway District Police Agency was reduced to the Railway Police Unit, and the Coast Guard was established on December 23, 1953. In 1963, when the railroad police force was abolished, it was transferred to the Transportation Bureau. 

In 1974, the Public Security Bureau became the Security Headquarters, and in 1991, as the Security Headquarters was expanded to the National Police Agency, the Metropolitan Police Agency was changed to the Local Police Agency. 

In 1996, the Korea Coast Guard was separated as an organization under the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.

<doc id="229497" wikidata="Q40780" url="?curid=229497" title="Acre (state)">
<text>Acre () is a state located in the west of the North Region of Brazil and the Amazonia Legal. Located in the westernmost part of the country, at a two-hour time difference from Brasília, Acre is bordered clockwise by the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Rondônia to the north and east, along with an international border with the Bolivian department of Pando to the southeast, and the Peruvian regions of Madre de Dios, Ucayali and Loreto to the south and west. Its capital and largest city is Rio Branco. Other important places include Cruzeiro do Sul, Sena Madureira, Tarauacá and Feijó. The state, which has 0.42% of the Brazilian population, generates 0.2% of the Brazilian GDP.

Intense extractive activity in the rubber industry, which reached its height in the early 20th century, attracted Brazilians from many regions to the state. From the mixture of sulista, southeastern Brazil, nordestino, and indigenous traditions arose a diverse cuisine. It combines sun-dried meat (carne-de-sol) with pirarucu, a typical fish of the region. Such dishes are seasoned with tucupi, a sauce made from manioc.

Fluvial transport, concentrated on the Juruá and Moa rivers, in the western part of the state, and the Tarauacá and Envira rivers in the northwest, is the principal form of transportation, especially between November and June. Heavy seasonal rains frequently make the BR-364 impassable in those months; it usually connects Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul.

==Etymology==
The name, which was given to the territory in 1904, and to the state in 1962, is derived from one of the local rivers, perhaps originates from the Tupi word &quot;a&#x27;kir ü&quot; &quot;green river&quot;, or from the form &quot;a&#x27;kir&quot;, of the Tupi word &quot;ker&quot;, &quot;to sleep, to rest&quot;. It is believed more likely to be derived from &quot;Aquiri&quot;, a transliteration by European explorers of the term &quot;Umákürü&quot;, or &quot;Uakiry&quot;, from the Ipurinã dialect. Another hypothesis is that Acquiri derives from &quot;Yasi&#x27;ri&quot;, or &quot;Ysi&#x27;ri&quot;, meaning &quot;flowing or swift water&quot;.

According to one account, agriculturist João Gabriel de Carvalho Melo wrote during an 1878 trip on the Purús River to merchant Viscount of Santo Elias (from Pará), asking him for goods to be sent to the &quot;mouth of the Aquiri River&quot;. In Belém, the local merchant or his employees either misinterpreted Gabriel&#x27;s handwriting, or he spelled the name wrong: the goods and invoice which Gabriel received were marked as having been sent to the Acre River.

Acre possesses some nicknames: the End of Brazil, The Rubber Tree State, the Latex State (from when it was a center of rubber production) and the Western End.

The native inhabitants of Acre are called &quot;acrianos, in the singular &quot;acriano. Until the entry according to the Orthographic Agreement of 1990, the correct spelling was &quot;acreano in the singular and in the plural &quot;acreanos. In 2009, with the new orthographic agreement, the change generated controversy between the Academy of Letters of Acre (Academia Acreana de Letras) and the Brazilian Academy of Letters (Academia Brasileira de Letras). The latter said that the change would mean the denial of the state&#x27;s historical and cultural roots, by changing the last letter of the toponym from &quot;E&quot; to &quot;I&quot;.

==Geography==

The state of Acre occupies an area of (58,911 mi2) in the extreme west of Brazil. It is located at 70º west longitude and at 9º south latitude. In Brazil, the state is part of the North Region, forming borders with the states of Amazonas and Rondônia, and with two countries: Peru and Bolivia.

Practically all of the terrain of the state of Acre is part of the low sandstone plateau, or terra firme, morphological unit which dominates most of the Brazilian Amazon. These terranes rise, in Acre, from the southeast to the northeast, with very tabular topography in general. In the extreme west is found the Serra da Contamana or Serra do Divisor, along the western border, with the highest altitudes in the state (). About 63% of the state&#x27;s surface lies between in height; 16% between 300 and 609 (984 and 1,998 ft); and 21% between 200 and 135 (656 and 443 ft).

The climate is hot and very humid, of the &quot;Am&quot; type in the Köppen climate classification system, and the monthly average temperatures vary between , being the lowest average of the North Region. The rainfall reaches an annual total of , with a clear dry season in the months of June, July, and August.

The Amazon Rainforest covers all of the state territory. Very rich in rubber trees of the most valuable species (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;) and Brazil nut trees (&quot;Bertholletia excelsa&quot;), the forest guarantees that Acre is the greatest national producer of rubber and nuts. Acre&#x27;s principal rivers, mostly navigable during the wet season (the Juruá, Tarauacá, Envira, Purús, Iaco, and Acre), cross the state with almost parallel courses which converge only outside of its territory.

The largest recorded Black Caiman, measured at and weighing , was shot in Acre in 1965.

The Amazon represents over half of the planet&#x27;s remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species-rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. More than 1/3 of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest.

==Statistical and legal subdivisions==
Acre is divided into 22 municipalities, 5 immediate regions and 2 intermediate regions:
===Rio Branco===
* Immediate Region of Brasileia
* Immediate Region of Rio Branco

==History==


The region of present-day Acre is thought to have been inhabited by Pre-Columbian civilizations since at least 2,100 years ago. Evidence includes complex geoglyphs of this age found in the area. The natives who crafted them are believed to have had a relatively advanced knowledge of this technology. Since at least the early 15th century, the region has been inhabited by peoples who spoke Panoan languages; their territory was geographically close to that of the Inca.

In the mid-18th century, the region was colonized by the Spanish and became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Following the Peruvian and Bolivian wars of independence, which ended in 1826, the region and large portions around it became part of both Peru and Bolivia respectively, but independent of Spain and both states disputed the territory. It was a territory of the short-lived Peru–Bolivian Confederation (1836–1839), until the two countries separated and most of the region returned to Bolivian control.

The discovery of rubber tree groves in the region in the mid-19th century attracted numerous immigrants, especially from Brazil and Europe, seeking to build on the rubber boom. Despite the increased numbers of Brazilians, the Treaty of Ayacucho (1867) determined that the region belonged to Bolivia. By 1877, Acre&#x27;s population was composed almost entirely of Brazilians coming from the Northeast.

In 1899, Brazilian settlers from Acre created an independent state in the region called the Republic of Acre. Bolivians tried to gain control of the area, but Brazilians revolted and there were border confrontations. This resulted in what was known as the Acre War. On November 17, 1903, with the signing over and sale in the Treaty of Petrópolis, Brazil received final possession of the region. Acre was integrated into Brazil as a territory divided into three departments. The territory was acquired by Brazil for two million pounds sterling. The land was taken from Mato Grosso in accordance with terms for the construction of the Madeira-Mamoré railway.

Once the Acre War was over, Peru did not recognize the annexation of Acre until 1909, with the Velarde-Río Branco Treaty, where the borders between Peru and Brazil were defined. It was signed in Rio de Janeiro, on September 8, 1909, by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, Baron of Rio Branco, and the plenipotentiary minister of Peru in Brazil, Hernán Velarde, by President Augusto B. Leguía (first government) then ruled in Peru, and in Brazil by the president Nilo Pecanha, in order to solve the border problems between Peru and Brazil.

Acre was united in 1920. On June 15, 1962, it was elevated to the category of state, and was the first to be governed by a woman, Iolanda Fleming, a teacher.

During the early twentieth century, rubber seedlings were taken to Southeast Asia, where competitive plantations were established, reducing the importance of the Amazon in production. But during the Second World War, Japanese forces took over the rubber tree groves of Malaya.

Acre was called on to produce rubber for the Allied war effort. The Rubber Soldiers, natives mostly of the Ceará plantation, increased production and provided critical supplies to the Allies.

Acre&#x27;s decisive contribution to the Allied victory may have helped Brazil attract North American investment to form the National Steel Company (Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional) in the postwar era. This company aided in the industrialization of the Central-south, which did not yet possess basic heavy industries.

On April 4, 2008, Acre won a judicial debate with the state of Amazonas in relation to the dispute surrounding the Cunha Gomes Line. It annexed part of the municipalities of Envira, Guajará, Boca do Acre, Pauini, Eirunepé and Ipixuna. The territorial redefinition consolidated the incorporation of 1.2 million hectares of the Liberdade, Gregório, and Mogno forest complex to the territory of Acre, which corresponds to .

===Initial settlement===

Since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs, major geometric earthworks, have been discovered on deforested land in Acre, and dated to between 1–1250 AD. These are cited as evidence of complex Pre-Columbian societies. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Unnatural Histories&quot; explored studies of this area, concluding that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine &quot;wilderness&quot;, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years. Traditional ancient practices included forest gardening. Ondemar Dias is credited as the first to discover the geoglyphs in 1977. Alceu Ranzi expanded their findings by flying over Acre.

During the 17th century, Portuguese expeditions reached many of the far ends of present-day Brazil. The expansion of the exploration to the west followed, and they reached lands under control by the Spanish colonies. The two nations negotiated to establish their territories, under the Treaties of Madrid (1750) and San Ildefonso (1777). Both of the treaties were based on the explorations of Portuguese &quot;bandeirante&quot; Manoel Félix de Lima of the Guaporé and Madeira river basins. The treaties established the riverbeds of the Mamoré and Guaporé to their maximum western limits on the left bank of the Javari as the border between the Spanish and Portuguese territories.

The Portuguese created the new royal captaincy of Mato Grosso (1751), stimulating settlement toward the frontier. New centers developed: Vila Bela (1752) on the banks of the Guaporé, Vila Maria (1778) on the Paraguay River, and Casalvasco (1783). Until the mid-19th century, there was little effort to settle the area systematically. At that time, the great virgin source of rubber attracted commercial interest, and development followed.

The empire was directed towards agricultural exports, based on coffee as the most important commodity. The territories of the extreme west were unknown and usually overlooked. For example, although Cândido Mendes de Almeida&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of the Empire of Brazil&quot; (1868), was considered a model of its time, geographers knew nothing of the Acre River and its principal tributaries, which did not appear at all in the atlas.

Some few armed bands of Brazilian explorers exploited the rural and unpopulated region, not knowing and little interested in whether they were &quot;controlled&quot; by Brazil, Peru, or Bolivia.

But the rubber boom of the mid-19th century, stimulated exploration by various expeditions to survey this resource and develop a plan for colonial settlement. At that time, João Rodrigues Cametá initiated the conquest of the Purús River; Manuel Urbano da Encarnação, an Indian with extensive knowledge of the region, reached the Acre River, traveling up it as far as the vicinity of the Xapuri; and João da Cunha Correia reached the drainage basin of the upper Tarauacá. For the most part, these expeditions took place on Bolivian land.

Exploitative activities, the industrial importance of the rubber reserves, and the penetration of Brazilian colonists in the region raised the attention of Bolivia, which solicited a better fixation of boundaries. After much failed negotiation, in 1867 the Treaty of Ayacucho was signed, which recognized the colonial &quot;uti possidetis&quot;, or use of that territory by Brazil. A border was established parallel to the confluence of the Beni and Mamoré rivers, running eastward to the headwaters of the Javari River, even though the source of this river was not yet known.

===Northeast occupation===
As the price of rubber rose in the market, the demand for it grew. The race to the Amazon increased. Plantations multiplied in the valleys of the Acre, Purús and, farther west, the Tarauacá. In the year 1873–1874, in the drainage basin of the Purús, the population rose from around one thousand to four thousand inhabitants. The Brazilian imperial government, already sensitive to the resulting offerings of rubber, considered the entire valley of the Purús to be Brazilian.

In the second half of the 19th century, disturbances were registered in the demographic and geo-economic balance of the empire. The coffee boom in the south attracted financial resources and workers, to detriment of the northeast. The growing impoverishment of that region stimulated migratory waves to the states of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and São Paulo. The movement of population became particularly active during the prolonged drought of the northeastern interior, from 1877 to 1880. Hundreds of Ceará indigenous people headed for the rubber plantations in search of work.

The Cearense migration reached the banks of the Juruá and accelerated the occupation of land which Bolivia would later reclaim. The great fluvial rivers and their tributary systems were full of small ship fleets transporting colonists, goods, and supply material to the most isolated centers. The governments of Amazonas and Pará quickly established &quot;supply houses&quot;, which financed various types of operations, guaranteed credit, and promoted the commercial incentive of the rubber tree groves.

The rubber race had the frantic urgency of gold rushes of the 18th century. The situation drew the attention of the government to the economic use and development of an almost completely unknown area. The activities of private businesses would enable the government to incorporate the new region.

===Land dispute===
In 1890, José Manuel Pando, a Bolivian official, alerted his government to the fact that more than three hundred rubber plantations had been developed in the Jura basin, and most were occupied by Brazilians on what was nominally Bolivian territory. The Brazilian penetration had advanced west from the 64th meridian to beyond the 72nd, in an extension of one thousand kilometers, despite the borders having been established. The Treaty of 1867 limited Brazil to land above the confluence of the Beni and Mamoré rivers.

In 1895 a new commission to define the borders was created. The Brazilian representative, Gregório Taumaturgo de Azevedo, resigned after verifying that the ratification of the Treaty of 1867 would harm the Brazilian rubber gatherers already settled in Bolivian territory. In 1899, the Bolivians established an administrative post in Puerto Alonso, exacting taxes and customs duties upon Brazilian activities. The following year, Brazil accepted the sovereignty of Bolivia in the zone, when it officially recognized the old boundaries at the confluence of the Beni and Mamoré rivers.

Distant from the diplomatic process, the rubber workers judged their interests to have been cheated, and initiated insurrection movements. Some of this was in response to brutal treatment and abuse by forces managed by the major rubber companies. In the same year that Bolivia established administration in Puerto Alonso (1899), two serious uprisings occurred.

In April, a Cearense lawyer, José Carvalho, led an armed movement, which culminated in the expulsion of the Bolivian authorities. Shortly thereafter, Bolivia began negotiations with an Anglo-American trust, the &quot;Bolivian Syndicate&quot;, in order to promote, with exceptional force (exacting of taxes, armed force), the political and economic incorporation of Acre into its territory. The governor of Amazonas, Ramalho Júnior, informed of the agreement by a functionary of the Bolivian consulate in Belém, Luis Gálvez Rodríguez de Arias, sent military contingents forward to occupy Puerto Alonso. Gálvez proclaimed the independence of Acre, in the form of a republic. He became its president with the acquiescence of the rubber gatherers. Under protests from Bolivia, President Campos Sales abolished the ephemeral republic (March 1900).

Bolivians, reinstated in the region, suffered in 1900 from the assault of the so-called Floriano Peixoto expedition, or &quot;expedition of the poets&quot;. It was made up of intellectual bohemians from Manaus. Following brief fighting in the area surrounding Puerto Alonso, the expedition was completely scattered.
Ultimately, the Bolivian government signed a contract with the &quot;Bolivian Syndicate&quot; (July 1901). The Brazilian congress, shocked by the arbitrariness of the act, took measures, canceling commercial accords and navigation between the two countries, and suspending the right of travel to Bolivia.

At the same time, Brazilians organized a large armed assault on the disputed area. The operations were led by a former student of the Military School of Rio Grande do Sul (Escola Militar do Rio Grande do Sul), José Plácido de Castro. The rubber gatherers occupied the village of Xapuri in Alto Acre (August 1902), and took Bolivian officials into custody. Finally, Plácido de Castro&#x27;s forces besieged Puerto Alonso, proclaiming the Independent State of Acre, after the capitulation of Bolivian troops (February 1903).

===Diplomatic intervention===

José Plácido de Castro was proclaimed governor of the new Independent State of Acre, and he had to discuss the question of borders in the diplomatic sphere. The Baron of Rio Branco, who had just assumed the role of Brazil&#x27;s Minister of External Relations, immediately opened channels which were meant to have put an end to the question.

The simplest problem, with the &quot;Bolivian Syndicate&quot;, was resolved by Brazil paying one hundred and ten thousand pounds to renounce the contract (February 1903). Next, commercial relations were reestablished with Bolivia, while a part of the territory on the upper Purús and Juruá, militarily occupied in March 1903, was declared litigious.

Bolivia finally agreed to cede to Brazil an area of , in exchange for two million pounds sterling, paid in two installments. Brazil committed to the construction of a Madeira-Mamoré Railway, connecting Porto Velho to Guajará-Mirim, at the confluence of the Beni and Madeira rivers. These actions were ratified in the Treaty of Petrópolis (November 17, 1903), through which Brazil acquired the future territory, now state of Acre.

Peru had also claimed sovereignty over the entire territory of Acre and part of the state of Amazonas, based on historic colonial titles. After armed conflicts between Brazilians and Peruvians on the upper Purús and Juruá, a joint administration was established in those regions (1904). The studies to determine the borders proceeded until the end of 1909, when a treaty was signed that completed the political integration of Acre into Brazilian territory.

===Development from territory to statehood===

Exercising a prominent role in national exports until 1913, when rubber was introduced to European and North American markets, Acre enjoyed a period of great prosperity. At the start of the 20th century, in a period of less than ten years, it grew to have more than 50,000 inhabitants.

From 1946 on, the federal government undertook actions to revive the economy of the Amazon Basin, and to include it in regional development projects.

Attending to the judicial arrangements of the Treaty of Petrópolis, President Rodrigues Alves sanctioned the law which created the Territory of Acre (1904), further dividing it into three departments: Alto Acre, Alto Purús, and Alto Juruá, the latter being separated to form Alto Tarauacá (1912). The departmental administration was exercised until 1921 by mayors appointed by the President of Brazil. At that time the arrangements were altered, passing the administration to a governor. The second Constitution of Brazil (1934) conceded to Acre the right to elect representatives to the National Congress of Brazil.
During the Estado Novo (New State) political ideas involving the valorization of the interior took hold, with the intention of promoting the articulation of more isolated areas. Thereafter, the vote of 1946 commended the channeling of budgetary resources from the Union to the Amazon, determining that the Territory of Acre would be elevated to the condition of state as soon as its revenue reached the equivalent of the lowest state tax exaction.

In the 1960s, the second cycle of efforts to accelerate the progress of the Amazon area was begun with the Superintendency of the Development of the Amazon (Superintendência do Desenvolvimento da Amazônia or SUDAM, 1966). Better networking of regional sub-sectors within the state was sought out, thus connecting the branch lines of the Transamazônica, which connected Rio Branco and Brasiléia, on the upper course of the Acre River, and Cruzeiro do Sul, on the banks of the Juruá, crossing the valleys of the Purús and the Tarauacá. Planning politics developed, therefore, destined to correct the demographic, economic, and political distortions of national integration.

==Culture==
Despite being the only state that fought to be Brazilian (Acre War), Acre&#x27;s culture is similar to that of other Northern Brazilian states, however, there is a high consumption of Northeastern Brazilian culture. In Rio Branco, there is a religious community called Alto Santo (Universal Christian Enlightenment Center) that practices the Santo Daime Ritual, typical of Acre, of indigenous origin, which uses Daime, a natural tea made with leaves and vines, used by the Indigenous peoples as a way of approaching God. The ritual implies in drinking a tea, including children and the elderly. The members wear uniforms and sing the hymnal.

The best-known dish consumed by Acreans is called Baixaria. The typical food uses duck, tucupi, cassava flour and pirarucu fish, in addition to the huge variety of Amazonian fruits inherited from the Indigenous peoples.

Some singers, activists and artists from Acre: João Donato, Sansão Campos Pereira, Chico Mendes, Sergio Souto and Tião Natureza.

==Flag==

The flag was adopted on March 15, 1921. It is a variation of the flags used by the secessionist state of Acre, with the yellow and green parts exchanged and mirrored. The yellow color symbolizes peace, green hope, and the star symbolizes the light which guided those who worked to make Acre a state of Brazil.

<text>Abner Read (1821–1863) was an officer of the United States Navy who distinguished himself in the American Civil War. He died of injuries sustained while patrolling the Mississippi River, in command of the . At the time of his death, he had attained the rank of lieutenant commander.

==Early life and education==
Abner Read was born April 5, 1821, in Urbana, Ohio, to Ezra Read and Nancy (Clark) Read. He studied at Ohio University, but left that institution a year before graduating to accept a warrant as a midshipman, effective March 2, 1839. Assigned to , he departed New York City in that schooner on March 16, 1840 and proceeded to South American waters where he served first in &quot;Enterprise&quot; and then in until the latter sailed for home early in 1844.

Following a year of study at the naval school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Read was promoted to passed midshipman on July 2, 1845. then took him to the Atlantic coast of Africa where she operated against slavers through the summer of 1847.

==Sea and shore duty, 1848–1860==
Next ordered to , he departed New York in that storeship on January 9, 1848, and proceeded to Veracruz where she arrived a week after the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. His vessel promptly began issuing supplies to the warships of Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s squadron and continued such duty until heading home in June.

&quot;Fredonia&quot; again left New York on December 11, 1848, bound for California. Gold recently had been discovered there, greatly increasing the importance of and the interest in that newly acquired territory. The ship proceeded south along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, rounded Cape Horn, reached San Francisco Bay on July 31, 1849, and operated on the west coast during the most tempestuous year of the gold rush. She got underway homeward on July 4, 1850, and reached New York on January 7, 1851.

Leave and a tour of duty in , the receiving ship at Philadelphia, ensued before Read reported to the side-wheel steamer in the autumn of 1853. She took him to the Mediterranean, but he left that ship while she was still in European waters and returned to the United States for duty at the Portsmouth Navy Yard.

Meanwhile, Read had been rising in rank. He received his commission as master effective April 12, 1853, and was promoted to lieutenant on February 6, 1854.

Read joined the wardroom of the sloop-of-war in the fall of 1854, departed Norfolk, Virginia, in her on December 16, 1854, and cruised through the West Indies unsuccessfully seeking information concerning . That sloop-of-war had departed Aspinwall, Colombia, (now Colón, Panama), on September 29, 1854, and had not been heard from since sailing.

Soon after &quot;Falmouth&quot; returned to New York in August, Read was shocked to be &quot;dropped from the Navy&quot; on September 13, 1855, in compliance with the recommendation of a board of officers charged with carrying &quot;...into execution an act [of Congress] to promote the efficiency of the Navy.&quot; He appealed this decision and was reinstated in rank by a board of inquiry in 1858.

His first ship following his return to duty was , which departed New York in the autumn of 1858 and took him back to South American waters as a part of Commodore Shubrick&#x27;s expedition to demand an apology and retribution for the death of &#x27;s helmsman. That sailor had been killed by fire from Paraguayan batteries upon his side-wheel steamer as she explored the Paraná River and its tributaries.

Following the resolution of the dispute between the United States and Paraguay through diplomacy backed by a highly visible display of American seapower, &quot;Supply&quot; operated off the coast of Africa, along the Atlantic coast of the United States, and in the Gulf of Mexico.

==Civil War service==
&quot;Supply&quot; arrived at Pensacola, Florida, on December 7, 1860, just a month and a day after Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States, precipitating the secession crisis. Just over a week later, entered the navy yard at that port to have her hull scraped. That screw steamer was short of officers due to the resignation of Southerners, so Read was detached from &quot;Supply&quot; and assigned to the new arrival. In her he helped to prevent Fort Pickens from falling into Confederate hands. However, while doing so, he became ill and was sent home to recuperate.

===Command of the USS &quot;New London&quot;===
Ready for duty again, Read took command of the newly acquired when she was commissioned at New York on October 29, 1861. Assigned to the Gulf Squadron, his screw steamer was stationed in Mississippi Sound where she joined screw gunboat in taking the lumber-laden schooner &quot;Olive&quot; shortly before midnight on November 21, 1861.

In ensuing months, &quot;New London&quot; took over 30 prizes. Her success was so remarkable that Flag Officer David Farragut felt that he must hold &quot;New London&quot; in his new command even though she had been assigned to the eastern group when the Navy divided its force in the gulf into two squadrons. &quot;...Lieutenant Read&#x27;s having made her such a terror to the Confederates in this quarter&quot;, he explained, &quot;...that justice to the service required me to keep her...&quot; She was, he maintained, &quot;...absolutely necessary to command the inland passage...&quot;

Read and his ship were ever ready to face up to any challenge which confronted them. When he found &quot;...two rebel steamers ... at Pass Christian...&quot; on March 25, 1862, &quot;New London&quot; headed straight for and and drove them off to the protection of Southern shore batteries after a two-hour engagement.

Read was promoted to lieutenant commander on July 16, 1862, and on April 18, 1863, he led a boat expedition which landed near the lighthouse at Sabine Pass. It was attacked by a large force of Confederate troops who had been hiding behind the light keeper&#x27;s house. All but one member of Read&#x27;s crew were wounded as they raced back to their boat and rowed to &quot;New London&quot;. Read himself suffered a serious gunshot wound of the eye. Yet, despite his painful injury, he remained on duty until &quot;New London&quot; returned to New Orleans, Louisiana, late in May for repairs.

While work on &quot;New London&quot; was still in progress Read was detached from her on June 22 and ordered to relieve Captain Melancton Smith in command of . Six days later his new ship headed up the Mississippi River to defend Donaldsonville, Louisiana, which was then being threatened by Southern troops. As its beleaguered riparian fortresses at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Port Hudson were about to slip from its grasp, the Confederacy was struggling desperately to maintain some hold on the river.

&quot;Monongahela&quot; spent the ensuing days patrolling the Mississippi between Donaldsonville and New Orleans. On the morning of July 7, 1863, Southern forces opened fire on the ship with artillery and musketry when she was about ten miles below Donaldsonville. A shell smashed through the bulwarks on her port quarter wounding Read in his abdomen and his right knee. He was taken to a hospital at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he died on the evening of the next day.

Farragut and the other officers of the squadron were lavish in praise of their fallen comrade. The admiral said that Read had &quot;...perhaps done as much fighting as any man in this war... The very mention of his name&quot;, Farragut maintained, &quot;was a source of terror to the rebels.&quot; On another occasion, the Admiral said, &quot;I know nothing of him prejudicial as a man, but I do know that no Navy can boast a better officer and I deem him a great loss both to the Navy and to his country.&quot;

<doc id="229502" wikidata="Q40130" url="?curid=229502" title="Amapá">
<text>Amapá () is one of the 26 states of Brazil. It is in the North Region of Brazil. It is the second-least populous state and the eighteenth-largest state by area. Located in the far northern part of the country, Amapá is bordered clockwise by French Guiana to the north for 730 km, the Atlantic Ocean to the east for 578 km, Pará to the south and west, and Suriname to the northwest for 63 km. The capital and largest city is Macapá. The state has 0.4% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for only 0.22% of the Brazilian GDP.

In the colonial period the region was called Portuguese Guiana and was part of Portugal&#x27;s State of Brazil. Later, the region was distinguished from the other Guianas. Amapá was once part of Pará, but became a separate territory in 1943, and the decision to make it a state was made in 1988. The first state legislators took office on 1 January 1991.

The dominant feature of the region, and 90 percent of its total area, is the Amazon rainforest. Unexplored forests occupy 70 percent of Amapá, and Tumucumaque Mountains National Park, established in 2002, is the largest tropical forest park in the world. The mouth of the River Oiapoque is the northern end of Brazil&#x27;s coastline.

==History==
During the colonial era from 1637 to 1654 the Amapá region was merged into the Captaincy of Pará, which was the Captaincy of Cabo de Norte. In the early colonial period the Amapá region was a rich source of lumber, resins, annatto, vegetable oils, and salted fish, all of which were exported to Europe. The French established sugarcane plantations in this period.
With the discovery of mineral deposits the Amapá region was invaded by the British and Dutch, who were ultimately repelled by the Portuguese. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 established the boundaries between the colony of Brazil and French Guiana, but these were not respected by the French. A fort was constructed at São José de Macapá, in present-day Macapá, as a base of Portuguese power in the region. In the 18th century, France retook control of the area. This international dispute continued until 1900.

The discovery of gold and the increasing value of rubber on the international market during the 19th century increased the Portuguese population of Amapá, bringing the dispute with France to a head. Although French settlers had established the Republic of Independent Guyana (1886–1891), Brazil challenged the Amapá claim through international arbitration in Geneva on 1 December 1900, which was found in favour of Brazil. It was subsequently incorporated into the state of Pará, as &quot;Araguari&quot; after the Araguari River and in 1943 this became the federal territory of Amapá.

The discovery of rich manganese deposits in Serra do Navio in 1945 revolutionized the local economy. Manganese remains the largest source of revenue in the state. Amapá&#x27;s move to statehood was made on 5 October 1988, at the time of the promulgation of the new Brazilian Constitution, with the first state legislators taking office at the start of 1991.

==Geography==

The State of Amapá possesses the lowest rate of loss of its original vegetation for any Brazilian state, estimated at only 2%. Most of the Amapá territory is covered with rainforest, while the remaining areas are covered with savannah and plains. On the Amapá coast, almost intact beaches mix with swamps, creating the largest representation of this biome in Brazil. This mixture of salt and fresh water is perfect for the food chain reproduction of several animal species. Pollution, however, is now a chronic problem in the state of Amapá. Mercury, which is used in the extraction of gold, is widely found in water sources and sewage systems in the population centers of Amapá.

===Nature===
To protect the natural resources of the state, there are, as of 2016, 12 protected areas and five indigenous territories covering , or 72% of the state. The Amapá Biodiversity Corridor has been established in 2003 to provide integrated management for the conservation area. The most important protected areas are the Tumucumaque Mountains National Park located in the west of the state, and the Cabo Orange National Park located near the coast. The Tumucumaque Mountains National Park is the world&#x27;s largest tropical forest national park. The Cabo Orange National Park contains flooded grasslands and mangrove forests which are important fish nurseries.

===Climate===

Most of Amapá has a Tropical monsoon climate, a tropical climate with a short dry season and heavy rainfall for the majority of the year. In the Köppen climate classification, it is classified under the letters &quot;Am&quot;. Tropical rainforest is the natural vegetation, and also provides the other climate type located in the state.

==Demographics==
According to the 2022 census, there were 733,759 people residing in the state, with a population density of 5.1/km2. The population of Amapá is highly urbanized, with 93.7% of the population residing primarily in Macapá and Santana. Population growth: 5.7% (1991–2000); Houses: 144,000 (2006).

During the 2022 census, 65.3% identified as Pardo (multiracial), 21.4% as White Brazilians, 11.8% as Black Brazilians and 1.4% as Indigenous. The remaining 0.1% are Asians and undeclared.

The majority of the residents of Amapá live in poverty. According to the Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) 36.56% of the population live on only R$79 per month, which the foundation considers below a decent standard of living.

=== Religion ===

According to data obtained by the IBGE in the 2010 Brazilian Census, 64% of Amapá residents are Roman Catholics, 28% are evangelicals (Protestants) and 6% do not profess any religion. The other faiths added together add up to 2% of the population.

The Catholic Church comprises the Diocese of Macapá (1949) a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Belém de Pará, under Bishop Pedro José Conti (2004) with 27 parishes.

=== Municipalities ===
It is divided into 16 municipalities.
=== Indigenous population ===

The Amerindians tribes in Amapá are located in the north near the Oiapoque River, and in the east in the Wayampi Indigenous Territory. All the indigenous territories in Amapá have been demarcated. The tribes living in Amapá are the Galibi do Oiapoque, the Karipuna do Amapá, the Palikur, the Wayampi and the Galibi Marwono.

The region around the Amazon River used to support a large population of Amerindians during the pre-Columbian era. The policy of the Portuguese monarchy was to engage in war in order to clear them from the land. The Cabanagem Revolt in the 1830s, resulted in the final dispersal of the Amerindians along the Amazon.

===Education===
Portuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. French is the second language taught in every school due to the proximity of French Guiana. A Creole language called Lanc-Patuá is spoken among some of the people.

====Educational institutions====
* Universidade Federal do Amapá (Unifap) (Federal University of Amapá)
* Universidade Estadual do Amapá (UEAP) (Amapá State University)
* Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Amapá (IFAP) (Amapá Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology)
* Centro de Ensino Superior do Amapá (Ceap)
* Instituto de Ensino Superior do Amapá (Iesap)
* Instituto Macapaense de Ensino Superior (IMMES)
* Faculdade Seama (Seama College)

==Economy==
The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 87.6%, followed by the industrial sector at 7.8%. Agriculture represents 4.6% of GDP (2004). Amapá exports: wood 75.5%, ores 18.7%, heart of palm 5.5% (2002). The state, which has 0.4% of the Brazilian population, is responsible for only 0.22% of the Brazilian GDP.

== Transport ==
===International Airport===
The main airport of the state is Macapá International Airport. On 12 April 2019 a new terminal was opened replacing an older facility. Following its closure, the old terminal was demolished to make room for an enlarged apron which was completed by 2020.

===Highways===
There are two federal highways in Amapá: BR-156 connects Laranjal do Jari, Macapá and Oiapoque. The highway is connected to the road network of French Guiana via the Oyapock River Bridge. BR-210 connects Macapá with Serra do Navio. It is supposed to be extended all the way to the border with Colombia in Amazonas; however, as of 2021, it ends in the Wayampi Indigenous Territory. An important state road is the AP-010 which connects Macapá with Santana and Mazagão Velho.

There are no road connections to other Brazilian states. In Laranjal do Jari there is a ferry to Monte Dourado in Pará. In Port Santana, there is a ferry to Belém, Pará.

===Ports and harbours===
There is a small port in Macapá; however, it is not suitable for cargo traffic. The main harbour is the Port of Santana which is also used for international cargo.

==Flag==

The flag was adopted by Decree No. 8 of 23 April 1984. The blue represents the sky over Amapá and justice, the green represents the native rainforest, and the yellow represents the Union and its natural resources. The black stands for the deceased who worked for the state, and the white for the will of the state to live in peace and stability. The symbol on the hoist-side represents the Fortress of São José, out of which the state capital grew.

Before 1984, the state had a red-white-red flag, based on the flag of Pará, and similar to the flag of Peru.

<doc id="229504" wikidata="Q528428" url="?curid=229504" title="Douglas Fairbanks Jr.">
<text>Douglas Elton Fairbanks Jr. (December 9, 1909 – May 7, 2000) was an American actor, producer, and decorated naval officer of World War II. He is best-known for starring in such films as &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937), &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; (1941). He was the son of Douglas Fairbanks and the stepson of Mary Pickford, and his first marriage was to actress Joan Crawford.

== Early life ==

Douglas Elton Fairbanks Jr. was born in New York City in 1909. He was the only child of actor Douglas Fairbanks and Anna Beth Sully, the daughter of wealthy industrialist Daniel J. Sully. Fairbanks&#x27; father was one of cinema&#x27;s first icons, noted for such swashbuckling adventure films as &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, and &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;. Fairbanks had small roles in his father&#x27;s films &quot;American Aristocracy&quot; (1916) and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1921).

His parents divorced when he was nine years old, and both remarried. He lived with his mother in New York, California, Paris, and London.

Fairbanks began his education at the exclusive Hollywood School for Boys in Los Angeles. After his mother and stepfather moved to New York, he attended the Bovee School, a private grammar school for boys. While attending Bovee, he was also enrolled in an after-school drill academy called Knickerbocker Greys, which he attended for a year while assigned to the drum corps. After moving back to California, he attended Harvard Military School, followed by studies at the Polytechnic School in Pasadena. After his mother and he moved to France, Fairbanks attended Lycée Janson-de-Sailly.

== Film career ==
=== &quot;Stephen Steps Out&quot; and Paramount ===
Largely on the basis of his father&#x27;s name, in May 1923, Fairbanks Jr. was given a contract with Paramount Pictures at age 13, at $1,000 a week for three years. He was signed by Jesse L. Lasky, who said the junior Fairbanks &quot;is the typical American boy at his best&quot; and said he likely would be featured in a film about Tom Sawyer.

&quot;I do not think it is the right thing for the boy to do&quot;, said his father. &quot;I want to see him continue his education. He is only 13 years old.&quot; The young actor arrived in Hollywood in June 1923 and was mobbed.

&quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; was not made. Instead, Fairbanks Jr. appeared in &quot;Stephen Steps Out&quot; (1923). The film was not a hit.

Paramount and he parted ways by mutual consent and Doug went to Paris to resume his studies. A year later, he returned to the studio, hired at what Fairbanks called &quot;starvation wages&quot;, and having him work as a camera assistant.

&quot;I was anxious to build my career as an actor slowly and painstakingly&quot;, he said in 1928. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be a young, blond leading man with an aquiline nose and shiny white teeth.&quot;

Paramount gave him supporting roles in &quot;The Air Mail&quot; (1925) and &quot;Wild Horse Mesa&quot; (1925).

=== &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; and &quot;Young Woodley&quot; ===
Sam Goldwyn borrowed him to play the juvenile in &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; (1925), which wound up being his first box-office success. He had supporting roles in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The American Venus&quot; (1926), and &quot;Padlocked&quot; (1926). At Warner Bros., Fairbanks was in &quot;Broken Hearts of Hollywood&quot; (1926), then, at Metropolitan Pictures, he was in &quot;Man Bait&quot; (1927).

At MGM, he was in Edmund Goulding&#x27;s &quot;Women Love Diamonds&quot; (1927) and for Alfred E. Green at Fox he was in &quot;Is Zat So?&quot; (1927). He supported Will Rogers in &quot;A Texas Steer&quot; (1927). Also in 1927, Fairbanks made his stage debut in &quot;Young Woodley&quot; based on a book by John Van Druten. Fairbanks Jr received excellent reviews and the production was a success – the play did much to improve his reputation in Hollywood. A regular audience member was Joan Crawford, with whom Fairbanks became romantically involved. He also appeared in a stage production of &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Children&quot;.

=== Early leading-man roles ===
 Fairbanks&#x27; second lead role was in &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; (1928) for FBO. He was Helene Chadwick&#x27;s leading man in &quot;Modern Mothers&quot; (1928) at Columbia, and he starred in &quot;The Toilers&quot; (1928) for Tiffany. Fairbanks starred in another for Columbia, &quot;The Power of the Press&quot; (1928), directed by Frank Capra. He went back to supporting roles for &quot;The Barker&quot; (1928) at First National, his first &quot;talkie&quot; and &quot;A Woman of Affairs&quot; (1928) at MGM with Greta Garbo and John Gilbert.

Fairbanks had another starring role at FBO with &quot;The Jazz Age&quot; (1929) and received top billing over Loretta Young in &quot;Fast Life&quot; (1929) at Warner Bros. He appeared in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Our Modern Maidens&quot; (1929) opposite Crawford.

=== First National and Warner Bros. ===
First National gave Fairbanks a starring role in &quot;The Careless Age&quot; (1929), and he was reunited with Young in &quot;The Forward Pass&quot; (1929). He was one of many names in &quot;The Show of Shows&quot; (1929). In September 1929, he returned to the stage in a production of &quot;The Youngest&quot;. Victor Halperin cast Fairbanks in the lead of &quot;Party Girl&quot; (1930), and Ted Wilde paired him for a third time with Young in &quot;Loose Ankles&quot; (1930), back at First National.

In 1930, Fairbanks Jr. went to Warner Bros. to test for the second lead in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. Although he did not win the part, head of production Darryl F. Zanuck was impressed with Douglas&#x27;s screen test, and cast him in an important role in &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; directed by Howard Hawks. Universal borrowed him to have the lead role in &quot;Little Accident&quot; (1930) and at Warner Bros., he was in the lead in &quot;The Sin Flood&quot; (1930). He supported Leslie Howard in the prestigious &quot;Outward Bound&quot; (1930) and was Billie Dove&#x27;s leading man in &quot;One Night at Susie&#x27;s&quot; (1930).

=== &quot;Little Caesar&quot; ===
Fairbanks had a role supporting Edward G. Robinson in &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (1931), filmed in August 1930. &quot;We knew it was going to be good when we were making it, but not that it would become a classic&quot;, he later said. The movie was a big hit, and Warner Bros. offered Fairbanks Jr. a contract with cast and script approval – a condition which, Fairbanks Jr. says, was only offered to one other actor at the studio, Richard Barthelmess.

&quot;By sheer accident, I had four successes in a row in the early &#x27;30s, and although I was still in my 20s, I demanded and received approval of cast, story, and director. I don&#x27;t know how I got away with it, but I did!&quot; Because he spoke French, he was put in &quot;L&#x27;aviateur&quot; (1931). Back in Hollywood, he was in &quot;Chances&quot; (1931) and &quot;I Like Your Nerve&quot; (1931) with Young.

In June 1931, he starred in another play, &quot;The Man in Possession&quot;, which he also produced along with Sid Grauman. Fairbanks said he wanted to stay away from costume adventures, which were associated with his father. He starred in two pictures for Alfred E Green, &quot;Gentleman for a Day&quot; (1932), a melodrama with Joan Blondell, and the comedy &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be Famous&quot; (1932). He starred in a film shot in French, &quot;L&#x27;athlète incomplet&quot; (1932).

He starred in &quot;Love Is a Racket&quot; (1932) for William Wellman and &quot;Scarlet Dawn&quot; (1932) for William Dieterle. Fairbanks did another with Green, &quot;Parachute Jumper&quot; (1933), which gave an early co-starring role to Bette Davis. Fairbanks starred again with Young in &quot;The Life of Jimmy Dolan&quot; (1933) and did &quot;The Narrow Corner&quot; (1933) with Green. RKO borrowed Fairbanks to support Katharine Hepburn in &quot;Morning Glory&quot; (1933), a big success.

Fairbanks was reunited with Howard in &quot;Captured!&quot; (1933). In 1934, Warner asked all its stars to take a 50% pay cut because of the Depression. Fairbanks Jr. refused and was fired from the studio. He received a job offer from Britain and spent the next few years there, taking a residence in London&#x27;s Park Lane.

=== Britain and Criterion films ===
Fairbanks went to Britain to star in Alex Korda&#x27;s &quot;The Rise of Catherine the Great&quot; (1934) playing Grand Duke Peter opposite Elisabeth Bergner. &quot;Hollywood was getting to be a grind&quot;, he said at the time. &quot;They had me doing five and six pictures a year. Some of them looked all right on paper, but they had the habit of slipping down into programmer class. Only once in three years would I get a part that I cared about. I kept going up and down the ladder and not getting any place. There was nothing stable about my career in Hollywood.&quot;

He intended to return to Hollywood to appear in &quot;Design for Living&quot;, but became ill and was replaced by Gary Cooper. He did ultimately return to Hollywood for &quot;Success at Any Price&quot; (1934) at RKO, then returned to London for &quot;Mimi&quot; (1935). The latter starred Gertrude Lawrence, who became romantically involved with Fairbanks Jr. He announced he would make &quot;Zorro Rides Again&quot; with his father.

Fairbanks fell ill during the 1936 flu epidemic.

Fairbanks set up his own film production company, Criterion Films, where the board members included Paul Czinner. Among Criterion&#x27;s films were &quot;Man of the Moment&quot; (1935), &quot;The Amateur Gentleman&quot; (1936), &quot;Accused&quot; (1936), and &quot;Jump for Glory&quot; (1937). He announced &quot;Lancelot&quot;, but did not make it.

=== Return to Hollywood and focus on action roles ===
Fairbanks Jr. returned to Hollywood when David O. Selznick offered him the role of Rupert of Hentzau in &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937). He had been reluctant to accept the role, but his father urged him to do it, saying it was &quot;actor proof&quot;. The movie was a big success.

In December 1937, he signed a nonexclusive contract with RKO to make two films a year for five years, at $75,000 a film. RKO used him as Irene Dunne&#x27;s leading man in &quot;Joy of Living&quot; (1938). At Universal, he was Danielle Darrieux&#x27;s co-star in &quot;The Rage of Paris&quot; (1938) and Ginger Rogers&#x27;s in RKO&#x27;s &quot;Having Wonderful Time&quot; (1938). Selznick used him again in &quot;The Young in Heart&quot; (1938) with Janet Gaynor.

Fairbanks then had his biggest-ever hit with RKO&#x27;s &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939), alongside Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen. He began to work increasingly in action/adventure films: &quot;The Sun Never Sets&quot; (1939) at Universal; &quot;Rulers of the Sea&quot; (1939) at Paramount; &quot;Green Hell&quot; (1940) for James Whale at Universal, a flop; and &quot;Safari&quot; (1940) at Paramount.

He had a change of pace when he starred in and co-produced &quot;Angels Over Broadway&quot; (1940), written and directed by Ben Hecht at Columbia. His last film before enlisting was &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; (1941), a swashbuckler made as a tribute to Fairbanks&#x27; father. Fairbanks did not have faith in the film while it was being filmed (&quot;I thought we were cutting corners&quot;), but it was a huge success.

== World War II ==

Fairbanks was commissioned as a reserve officer in the United States Navy when the United States entered World War II, and was assigned to Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s commando staff in the United Kingdom.

In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him special envoy to South America. Fairbanks served on the cruiser during the disastrous Convoy PQ 17 operation.

Lieutenant Fairbanks was subsequently transferred to Virginia Beach, where he came under the command of Admiral H. Kent Hewitt, who was preparing U.S. naval forces for the invasion of North Africa. Fairbanks convinced Hewitt of the advantages of a military deception unit, then repeated the proposal at Hewitt&#x27;s behest to Admiral Ernest King, Chief of Naval Operations. King thereupon issued a secret letter on March 5, 1943, charging the Vice Chief of Naval Operations with the recruitment of 180 officers and 300 enlisted men for the Beach Jumpers program.

The Beach Jumpers&#x27; mission would simulate amphibious landings with a very limited force. Operating miles from the actual landing beaches and using their deception equipment, the Beach Jumpers would lure the enemy into believing that theirs was the principal landing.

United States Navy Beach Jumpers saw their initial action in Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. For the remainder of the war, the Beach Jumpers conducted their hazardous, shallow-water operations throughout the Mediterranean.

For his planning the diversion-deception operations and his part in the amphibious assault on Southern France, Lieutenant Commander Fairbanks was awarded the United States Navy&#x27;s Legion of Merit with bronze V (for valor), the Italian War Cross for Military Valor, the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; and the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; with Palm, and the British Distinguished Service Cross.

Fairbanks was also awarded the Silver Star for valor displayed while serving on PT boats, and in 1942, made an Officer of the National Order of the Southern Cross, conferred by the Brazilian government.

Among his other exploits was the sinking of the corvette UJ-6083 (formerly the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; &quot;Capriolo&quot;) while in command of a mixed division of American PT boats and British s plus assorted other small craft. Fairbanks commanded from . Fairbanks stayed in the US Naval Reserve after the war, and ultimately retired as a captain in 1954. In 1982, Fairbanks was awarded the German Federal Cross of Merit for his contribution to the relief of the needy in occupied Germany.

== Postwar years ==

=== Hollywood ===

Fairbanks returned to Hollywood at the conclusion of World War II. He spent two years finding a comeback vehicle, and picked &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; (1947), which was not a big hit.

He followed it with &quot;The Exile&quot; (1947), another swashbuckler, which Fairbanks wrote and produced; it was directed by Max Ophüls. The film was the first of three independent films Fairbanks was to produce – the others being a big screen version of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, and a film called &quot;Happy Go Lucky&quot;. It was another box office disappointment.

He thought his career would be revived by &quot;That Lady in Ermine&quot; with Betty Grable, but director Ernst Lubitsch died during production and was replaced by Otto Preminger; the resulting film was not a success, and Fairbanks Jr believes this cost his career momentum. Fairbanks tried another swashbuckler for his own company, &quot;The Fighting O&#x27;Flynn&quot; (1949).

=== British career ===
As a confirmed Anglophile, Fairbanks spent much time in the United Kingdom post World War II, where he was well known in the highest social circles. He was made an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1949. In 1950 he purchased a house, no. 28, The Boltons in Mayfair, London which became his primary residence until he sold it in 1973 to move to Florida.

The College of Arms in London granted Fairbanks a coat of arms symbolizing the U.S. and Britain united across the blue Atlantic Ocean by a silken knot of friendship.

Fairbanks starred in the British thriller &quot;State Secret&quot; (1950), written and directed by Sidney Gilliat, and a comedy for Val Guest, &quot;Mr Drake&#x27;s Duck&quot; (1951)

Between 1954 and 1956, he also made a number of half-hour programs at one of the smaller Elstree film studios as part of a syndicated anthology series for television called &quot;Douglas Fairbanks Presents&quot;.

During the 1950s, Fairbanks appeared as himself on episodes of a number of American television shows, such as &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, &quot;The Ford Show&quot;, &quot;The Steve Allen Plymouth Show&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;.

He co-produced the films &quot;The Silken Affair&quot; (1957) and &quot;Chase a Crooked Shadow&quot; (1958).

In 1961, he was a guest at the wedding of Katharine Worsley to Prince Edward, Duke of Kent.

He guest-starred on shows such as &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, and &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;. He played King Richard in a TV musical &quot;The Legend of Robin Hood&quot; (1968).

== Later career ==
On stage, Fairbanks toured in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in 1968, and in &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot; several times, including tours in the U.S. in 1970–72 and the 1977 Australian production with Stanley Holloway, David Langton, Carole Ray- and Christine Amore. He appeared in some TV movies and TV series, including &quot;The Crooked Hearts&quot; (1972), &quot;The Hostage Tower&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

His last feature film was &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (1981). His last TV roles were in the mini series &quot;Strong Medicine&quot; (1987) and the TV series &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot;. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1989, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel in the foyer of Thames Television&#x27;s Teddington Studios.

Fairbanks was also involved in several successful business ventures. These included manufacturing ball point pens, real estate development, management of copyrighted theatrical works, and film production.

== Personal life ==
His first notable relationship was with the actress Joan Crawford, whom he began to date seriously during the filming of &quot;Our Modern Maidens&quot;. Fairbanks and Crawford married on June 3, 1929, at the &quot;Actors Chapel&quot;, St. Malachy Roman Catholic Church in midtown Manhattan, although neither was Catholic. Fairbanks was only 19; Crawford was 3 or 4 years older. Their witnesses were his mother, Beth Sully, and actor Jack Whiting, who were married themselves a few weeks later.

Fairbanks and Crawford travelled to Britain on a delayed honeymoon, where he was entertained by Noël Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Beatrice Lillie, and Prince George, Duke of Kent. He became active in both society and politics, but Crawford was far more interested in her career and had an affair with Clark Gable. In his first autobiography, he later admitted that he was also unfaithful during that period and that he unsuccessfully pursued Katharine Hepburn during the filming of &quot;Morning Glory&quot;. The couple divorced in 1933, but the divorce did not become final for another year.

Despite their divorce, Fairbanks was quick to defend Crawford when her adopted daughter Christina Crawford published &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, a scathing biography of Crawford&#x27;s personal life. He firmly stated, &quot;The Joan Crawford that I&#x27;ve heard about in &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; is not the Joan Crawford I knew back then.&quot; In his autobiography, he stated that he never saw a hint of any significant anger outbursts from Crawford during their marriage, and that she was more likely to sulk or argue than become angry.

On April 22, 1939, Fairbanks married Mary Lee Hartford (née Mary Lee Epling), a former wife of Huntington Hartford, the A&amp;P supermarket heir. He remained devoted to her until her death in 1988. They had three daughters: Daphne, Victoria, and Melissa, and eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. On May 30, 1991, Fairbanks married Vera Lee Shelton, a merchandiser for QVC Network Inc.

Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was claimed to be the naked man in the incriminating photos used as evidence in the divorce trial of Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll in 1963. However, in 2013, Lady Colin Campbell, Margaret Campbell&#x27;s stepdaughter-in-law, revealed that the man in the photo was actually Bill Lyons, sales director of Pan American Airlines.

Fairbanks was also named in connection with the Profumo Scandal.

Fairbanks was a friend of Laurence Olivier and was among the contributors to a documentary by &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; titled &quot;Laurence Olivier: A Life&quot;. He was also a close friend of Sir Rex Harrison and was a presenter at Harrison&#x27;s New York City memorial service.

He wrote his autobiography &quot;The Salad Days&quot; in 1988. In addition, Fairbanks wrote a chronicle of his experiences during the Second World War, &quot;A Hell of a War&quot;, published in 1993. Beyond his two volumes of autobiography, Fairbanks collaborated with Richard Schickel on the illustrated survey of Fairbanks Sr. and Jr. called &quot;The Fairbanks Album&quot; (1975) and Jeffrey Vance with a critical study/biography of Fairbanks Sr. ultimately published as &quot;Douglas Fairbanks&quot; (2008).

== Death and legacy ==
On the morning of May 7, 2000, Fairbanks died at the age of 90 of a heart attack and was interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California, in the same tomb as his father.

Fairbanks has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - one for motion pictures at 6318 Hollywood Boulevard, one for television at 6665 Hollywood Boulevard, and one for radio at 6710 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1969, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the International Best Dressed List.

The moving image collection of Douglas Fairbanks Jr., held at the Academy Film Archive, includes over 90 reels of home movies.

== Estate ==
Fairbanks&#x27;s personal belongings were auctioned September 13, 2011, by Doyle New York, surpassing estimated proceeds by netting over $500,000.

<text> (Spirit and soul become confused), 35, is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He composed the solo cantata for alto voice in Leipzig for the twelfth Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 8 September 1726.

Bach composed the cantata in his fourth year as &quot;Thomaskantor&quot; (musical director) in Leipzig. The text is based on the day&#x27;s prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God&#x27;s miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.

The cantata is structured in seven movements in two parts, to be performed before and after the sermon. Both parts are opened by an instrumental sinfonia with solo organ, probably derived from concerto music composed earlier in Weimar or Köthen. The alto singer performs a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives, accompanied in all three arias by the organ as an equal partner. The Baroque instrumental ensemble is formed by two oboes, taille, strings and basso continuo. The alto part is demanding and was probably written with a specific singer in mind, as with the two other solo cantatas composed in the same period. 
== History and words ==
Bach composed the cantata in his fourth year as in Leipzig for the Twelfth Sunday after Trinity. It is regarded as part of his third cantata cycle.
The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, the ministry of the Spirit (), and from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man (). The cantata text was written by Georg Christian Lehms and published in (1711). The text connects the healing of the deaf man to the thoughts of the believer who is left deaf and mute in awe looking at the healing of Jesus and God&#x27;s creation. The text of the second aria is almost a quote of the gospel&#x27;s last verse.

Because of the requirements that &quot;new music&quot; be composed as often as possible, Bach seldom chose older poems for his cantatas; consequently, the conductor Craig Smith has suggested that parts of this work may have been composed earlier than the first recorded Leipzig performance. Bach had already composed his first solo cantata on a text by Lehms, , composed during his tenure in Weimar, also for an alto soloist.

The cantata is one of three Bach cantatas written in Leipzig in 1726 in which an alto is the only vocal soloist, the others being , and . It seems likely that Bach had a capable alto singer at his disposal during this period.

Bach had earlier composed two other cantatas for the twelfth Sunday after Trinity, in his first year in Leipzig &quot;Lobe den Herrn, meine Seele&quot;, BWV 69a, first performed on 15 August 1723, and in his third year &quot;Lobe den Herren, den mächtigen König der Ehren&quot;, BWV 137, first performed on 19 August 1725, as an added part of his cycle of chorale cantatas. Both works focus on praise (&quot;Lob&quot;) and use an orchestra including festive trumpets.

Furthermore, the work has two large concerto movements for organ and orchestra, probably from a lost concerto for keyboard, oboe or violin, perhaps indicating that the cantata was composed for a seasonal choral &quot;absentia&quot; at Thomaskirche. The first nine bars of the opening sinfonia are practically identical to the fragment BWV 1059.

Bach led the first performance on 8 September 1726, and probably played the organ part himself.

== Structure and scoring ==
Bach structured the cantata in two parts, four movements to be performed before the sermon, three after the sermon. Both parts begin with a sinfonia. Bach scored the cantata for an alto soloist and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes (Ob), taille (Ot), obbligato solo organ (Org), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the &quot;Neue Bach-Ausgabe&quot;. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds, strings, and organ and continuo.




==Music==

John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted this work on the twelfth Sunday after Trinity in St. Jakob, Köthen as part of the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir in 2000, calls the occasion &quot;one of the most cheerful programmes of the whole Trinity season&quot;, leading Bach to compose &quot;celebratory pieces&quot;, two with trumpets and timpani, and finally this one with an obbligato organ. In an expanded two-part structure, the organ is both an instrumental soloist in the two sinfonias and a partner for the singer in all three arias. The musicologist Laurence Dreyfus distinguished Bach&#x27;s use of the organ as &quot;sacred icon&quot; versus &quot;galant conversationalist&quot;, writing on Bach&#x27;s &quot;assimilation of the secular solo concerto into his church cantatas and his adjustment of the normal concerto principle, that of soloist-versus-orchestra, through subtle shifts in role playing, the instrument now posing as a soloist, now retreating into the background.&quot;

=== 1 ===
The opening &quot;allegro&quot; sinfonia incorporates concerto techniques, suggesting an origin in a pre-existing concerto. The organ performs both the solo melody and the continuo line, punctuated by quasi-cadenza passages and interspersed ten-measure ritornellos. The musicologist Klaus Hofmann notes that in the movement in Italian style, the theme is &quot;subjected to intensive thematic working-out in the dialogue between solo instrument and orchestra&quot;.

=== 2 ===
The first aria in da capo form, &quot;&quot; (Spirit and soul become confused), is characterized by a broken ritornello and a sense of confusion and uncertainty. The rhythm is siciliano, a frequent feature in slow concerto movements by Bach and others. Hofmann concludes from many corrections in Bach&#x27;s autograph that the aria is a new composition. He sees the &quot;agility of the organ part which does not follow the siciliano pattern&quot; as an image of the &quot;confusion&quot; mentioned in the text.

=== 3 ===
A secco recitative, &quot;&quot; (I am amazed), expresses awe at the creation, rendered in the first person which according to Mincham underlines the cantata&#x27;s &quot;personal and individual emphasis&quot;. Beginning in a major mode which contrasts with the preceding aria, it turns to &quot;the solemnity of the minor mode&quot;.

=== 4 ===
An aria with obbligato organ, &quot;&quot; (God has made everything well), is the first movement in a major mode, expressing pleasure with God&#x27;s creation. It has a dominating two-part ritornello. Hofmann observes that the organ, this time the only partner of the voice, is &quot;rich in coloratura&quot; and has a theme, &quot;heard throughout the movement, sometimes in the manner of an ostinato, sometimes freely developed; in its figuration and motoric drive it is stylized just like Bach’s writing for the violoncello piccolo&quot;. Gardiner notes that not only the tessitura but also &quot;characteristic string-crossing patterns&quot; are reminiscent of violoncello piccolo use.

=== 5 ===
Part 2 begins with another sinfonia, this time in binary form. Hofmann describes it as &quot;an engaging perpetuum mobile introduced by the keyboard&quot;. It may be based on the final movement of a concerto. The organ interacts with the orchestra without a prelude, which is unusual in Bach&#x27;s concertos, but not without precedent, such as the harpsichord concerto in F major, BWV 1057

=== 6 ===
Another secco recitative, &quot;&quot; (Ah, powerful God, let me [think upon this continually]), is a prayer for the ability to always reflect on the miracle of creation. It quotes Jesus saying &quot;Hephata&quot; (Be opened) to the deaf mute man, and turns it to &quot;the believer&#x27;s heart would open up and his tongue would be loosened so that he might perceive and praise the divine miracles&quot;.

=== 7 ===
The cantata concludes with an aria with the complete orchestra, &quot;&quot; (I wish to live with God alone). It expresses the wish to dwell with God forever in a minuet of positive character. The movement again uses a two-part ritornello. When contrasting aspects of life on earth are mentioned, such as &quot;jammerreichen Schmerzensjoch&quot; (sorrowful yoke of pain) and &quot;martervollen Leben&quot; (tormented life), the music darkens to minor keys. The organ supplies triplet figures, which the voice also uses to express &quot;ein fröhliches Halleluja&quot; (a joyful hallelujah).

<doc id="229509" wikidata="Q40040" url="?curid=229509" title="Amazonas (Brazilian state)">
<text>Amazonas () is a state of Brazil, located in the North Region in the north-western corner of the country. It is the largest Brazilian state by area and the ninth-largest country subdivision in the world with an area of 1,570,745.7 square kilometers. It is the largest country subdivision in South America, being greater than the areas of Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay combined. Neighbouring states are (from the north clockwise) Roraima, Pará, Mato Grosso, Rondônia, and Acre. It also borders the nations of Peru, Colombia and Venezuela. This includes the Departments of Amazonas, Vaupés and Guainía in Colombia, as well as the Amazonas state in Venezuela, and the Loreto Region in Peru.

Amazonas is named after the Amazon River, and was formerly part of the Spanish Empire&#x27;s Viceroyalty of Peru, a region called Spanish Guyana. It was settled by the Portuguese moving northwest from Brazil in the early 18th century and incorporated into the Portuguese empire after the Treaty of Madrid in 1750. It became a state under the First Brazilian Republic in 1889.

Most of the state is tropical jungle; cities are clustered along navigable waterways and are accessible only by boat or plane. It is divided into 62 municipalities and the capital and largest city is Manaus, a modern city of 2.1 million inhabitants in the middle of the jungle on the Amazon River, 1,500 km upstream from the Atlantic Ocean. Nearly half the state&#x27;s population lives in the city; the other large cities, Parintins, Manacapuru, Itacoatiara, Tefé, and Coari are also along the Amazon River in the eastern half of the state.

==Etymology==
The name was originally given to the Amazon River that runs through the state by the Spaniard Francisco de Orellana in 1541. Claiming to have come across a warlike tribe of natives, with whom he fought, he likened them to the Amazons of Greek mythology, and hence named the river &quot;Río de las Amazonas&quot;.
==History==

===Rise of the rainforest===
At one time the Amazon River flowed westward, perhaps as part of a proto-Congo (Zaïre) river system from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were joined as part of western Gondwana. Fifteen million years ago, the Andes were formed by the collision of the South American Plate with the Nazca Plate (eastern Pacific oceanic) plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields, blocked the river and caused the Amazon to become a vast inland sea. Gradually this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater. For example, over 20 species of stingray, most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean, can be found today in the fresh waters of the Amazon.

About ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone to the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward. At this time the Amazon rainforest was born. During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river. Three million years later, the ocean level receded enough to expose the Central American isthmus and allow mass migration of mammal species between the Americas.

The Ice Ages caused tropical rainforest around the world to retreat. Although debated, it is believed that much of the Amazon reverted to savanna and montane forest. Savanna divided patches of rainforest into &quot;islands&quot; and separated existing species for periods long enough to allow genetic differentiation. A similar rainforest retreat took place in Africa, where Delta core samples suggest that even the mighty Congo watershed was void of rainforest at this time. When the ice ages ended, the forest was again joined, and the species that were once one, had diverged significantly enough to be designated as separate species, adding to the tremendous diversity of the region. About 6,000 years ago, sea levels rose about 130 meters, once again causing the river to be inundated like a long, giant freshwater lake.

===Native peoples===

The pre-Columbian Amazonas was inhabited by seminomadic peoples whose livelihood mixed occasional agriculture with a fishing and hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Because of Christopher Columbus&#x27; misunderstanding of the continent at which he had arrived, the native population were and are denominated &quot;índios&quot; by the Portuguese. Approximately two thousand Indian tribes lived in the region in the sixteenth century, perhaps amounting to some millions of people, but phenomena such as disease and assimilation to Brazilian culture caused their numbers to fall to approximately three hundred thousand, and two hundred tribes, by the end of the twentieth century. Certain uncontacted tribes still exist in the region.

===Colonial conflicts===
In the colonial time, the territory which today belongs to the State of Amazonas, was a combination of treaties, expeditions, evangelism and military occupations. Scarce but recorded claims and indigenous uprisings in the region, were initially made by the Spanish Empire through the Treaty of Tordesillas and after the Portuguese Empire by the First Treaty of San Ildefonso. The State also includes territory from failed attempts at colonization by the European powers, such as England and the Dutch empire.
The first Spanish expedition was by Francisco de Orellana in conjunction with Catholic priest Gaspar de Carvajal, who documented the expedition. He reported a conflict against indigenous women which led to the current name of the river, and then to the current name of the region and the state (Amazonas in English: Amazons). The second Spanish expedition was by Pedro de Ursúa, intending to prove the previous expedition, but resulted in the Spanish Kingdom dropping the attempt to colonize the region.

After the unification of the Iberian kingdoms, Portugal launched an expedition on the river [but in reverse from Francisco de Orellana, at the mouth of the river to the site of the present-day city of Quito, capital of Ecuador], with the intention of attaching Spanish lands (comprising the current territory of the Brazilian Amazon) to the Portuguese Kingdom. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union, Portuguese and Spanish possessions in the region were undefined, resulting in internal conflicts in the region between Portugal and Spain. The Portuguese Crown later asserted the principle of uti possidetis, with respect to the region. This was the first assertion of the principle from Roman law of &quot;uti possidetis, ita possideatis&quot;, (Latin, &quot;who has possession, has dominion&quot;), analogous to English common law &quot;Squatters rights&quot;. Due account may have been taken of John Locke&#x27;s labour theory of property.

Conflicting issues arose between what was granted by law in the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), and the subsequent reality of colonial expansion: the Spanish, eastward from the Pacific coastal plains (though restrained by the Andes), and the Portuguese, westward (aided by the waterways and lowlands of the mighty Amazon). The Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750) – that determined the border between the Spanish possessions and southern Portuguese Brazil – had first enunciated the principle that new states, at the time of their creation shall have dominion over the lands that were settled as colonies. It implicitly opened the door to claims by prior possession in the vast lands of the north.

After the independence of Brazil in 1822, the current borders of the Amazonas State were still undefined – at that time being with Gran Colombia. The internal conflicts within that neighbour country resulted in the emergence of Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama. Brazil signed the Treaty Vásquez Cobo–Martins (1908) (with those countries) finally entitling those possessions in the north to Brazil. One region is marked by the geodesic line Apóporis-Tabatinga; and the other is the municipal area of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, on the Brazil-Colombia border.

===Spanish conquistadors and Jesuits===

By the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the whole Amazon basin was in the area of the Spanish Crown. The mouth of a great river was explored by Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; Vicente Yáñez Pinzón, who reached it in February 1500, with his cousin Diego de Lepe. He called the river &quot;Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce&quot; (River of Saint Mary of the Sweet Sea) on account of the large freshwater estuary extending into the sea at its mouth.

In 1541, Spanish &quot;conquistadores&quot; Gonzalo Pizarro and Francisco de Orellana, from Quito, Ecuador, crossed the Andes Mountains and explored the course of the river to the Atlantic Ocean. The indigenous people called this river the &quot;Conoris&quot;. The myth of women warriors on the river has spread in the accounts and books, without any popular scope, still making those regions to receive names of warriors of Greek mythology, the Amazons — among them the largest river in the region that became known as the Amazon River. Early publications, as was the style of the day, called the river after its European explorer, the &quot;Orellana&quot;.

Also in the 16th century, there were the expeditions of &quot;conquistadores&quot; Pedro de Ursúa and Lope de Aguirre in search of the legendary &quot;El Dorado&quot;, the Lost City of Gold (1559–1561)
Spanish Jesuit missions were the first settlements upstream on the Amazon. As many as 30 missions were founded in Amazon territory, seven in Brazil, between 1638 and 1727. The municipality of Silves on an island of Lake Saracá is one of the oldest in the Amazon, originating in a Mercedarian Indian mission founded in 1663. By the early 18th century, they were destroyed by the Portuguese, depopulated by smallpox, or their indigenous residents taken away as slaves by Portuguese Bandeirantes. A few were taken over by Portuguese Carmelites. The destruction of the missions was the end of Spanish claims in western Amazonia. Only one is a populated place today, San Pablo, now the municipality of São Paulo de Olivença.

===English, Dutch and French outposts===
Starting about 1580, without effective occupation, English, Dutch, French (and even some Irish) searching for so-called &quot;Drogas do Sertão&quot; (spices of the backlands) had established some outposts upstream of the mouth of the Amazon.

===Portuguese usurpation===
From at least the time of the Tordesillas Treaty in 1494 until the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, the region of the upper Amazon was part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru (Viceroyalty of New Granada after 1717). Everything north of the Amazon (Solimões) and west of the Nhamundá River (Yamundá, in Spanish), an affluent of the left bank of the Amazon that forms the boundary of Amazonas with Pará, was known as Spanish Guyana.

Portuguese expansion westward and northward of the Tordesillas Line began from the frontier of the northernmost captaincy of Maranhão with the expulsion of the French from São Luis in 1615, and the founding of Belém at the mouth of the Amazon in 1616. Exploration and colonization thence followed the waterway upstream.

There are accounts of Portuguese Carmelite missionaries active in the Solimões area, upstream of the Rio Negro, as early as the 1620s, but permanent settlements weren&#x27;t established for another 80 years, so the records are nebulous.
The first documented Portuguese foray into upper Amazonia was the expedition of Portuguese explorer and military officer Pedro Teixeira, who followed the great river from the Atlantic Ocean to Quito, Ecuador with 70 soldiers and 1,200 Indians in forty-seven great canoes (1637–1639). He returned by the same route, arriving back in Belém in 1639. According to the Portuguese, Pedro Teixeira placed a possession marker at the upper Japurá River in 1639. Soon after that the Portuguese &quot;bandeirante&quot; António Raposo Tavares, whose &quot;bandeira&quot;, leaving the captaincy of São Vicente travelling overland, reached the Andes, and following the Amazon River, returned to Belém, visiting a total of about , between 1648 and 1651.

Tropical jungle is hostile and impenetrable as well as European settlements were exclusively along the waterways. Portuguese expansion generally was east to west, and from the main channel, the Solimões, north and south along the tributaries. The character of the settlements was of three kinds: defense and occupation (&quot;fortes&quot;), economic (&quot;feitorias&quot;), and evangelical (&quot;missões&quot;). The first permanent Portuguese settlements in the region were Itacoatiara 176 km east of Manaus, founded in 1655 by Portuguese Jesuit Padre António Vieira as Mission of Aroaquis on the island of Aibi near the mouth of Lake Arauató, followed by São Gabriel, founded in 1668 as by Franciscan Friar Teodózio [or Teodósio] da Veiga and Captain Pedro da Costa Favela on the Rio Negro, near the mouth of the Rio Aruím. In 1761, a fort was built on the location, and the settlement became the town of São Gabriel da Cachoeira. The first missionary &quot;aldea&quot; of the Portuguese in the Negro was that known as Santo Elias dos Tarumas (originally aldeia of Nossa Senhora da Conceição, and later called Airão), dating from 1692.
the capital Manaus, was founded in 1669 as the Fort of São José do Rio Negro (later called Lugar da Barra do Rio Negro or &quot;place on the shore of Rio Negro&quot;) on the confluence of the Rio Negro and Solimões Rivers.

The Royal Charter of 1693 divided Amazonia among the Jesuits, Carmelites, Capuchines and Franciscans: the Jesuits restricted their activities to the south bank of the Amazon upstream to the mouth of the Madeira; the north shore of the Amazon as far as the Trombetas fell to the Franciscans, to the mouth of the Rio Negro to the Mercedarians, and the Negro itself and the Solimoes to the Carmelites.
The Portuguese Carmelites got a later start than the Spanish Jesuits, but their impact was more durable. Between 1697 and 1757, they established eight missions on the Solimões and nine on the Rio Negro. In addition, there were a few Portuguese Jesuit missions in the Solimões. In 1731, Portuguese Jesuits received orders from the Governor Luiz de Vasconcellos Lobo to establish two &quot;aldeias&quot; above the mouth of the Rio Negro, one on the right bank of the Orellana Solimões, between the eastern mouth of the Javari and the Carmelite &quot;aldeia&quot; of São Pedro; the other at the western mouth of the great river Japurá. This was the beginning of what came to be called the Jesuit–Carmelite War.

Antidote to settlement was disease: fierce smallpox epidemics in 1661, 1695, 1724, and 1743/49 left the region nearly depopulated. A Carmelite Friar had notable success with the method of variolation in 1729, but the technique was not propagated. The Jenner cowpox vaccine was not introduced in Brazil until 1808. Variolation was prohibited in 1840, and vaccination was mandated in 1854. But epidemics got worse until finally petering out around the turn of the century.

Within the project of occupying the Amazon hinterland, was formed the royal captaincy of São José do Rio Negro subordinate to Para, in Mar. 1755, with headquarters in the village of Mariuá, (now Barcelos).

====The borders of Brazil====
The boundary between the Portuguese and Spanish domination of the Amazon was eventually fixed at the Rio Javari (river that rises on the border between Amazonas state, Brazil, and Loreto department, Peru) by the Treaty of Madrid in 1750.

By the mid-18th century, the effective boundary between the two empires, the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru and Portuguese Brazil, had shifted to the area of the confluence of the Rio Negro and Amazon Rivers, in upper Amazonia.
While the Treaty of Madrid in 1750 implicitly recognized the principle of &quot;uti possiditis&quot;, it did not actually specify the northern borders of the country. At that time, the border of contention between Spanish and Portuguese domains was in the upper Solimões, at the junction of the Rio Negro. In the upper Salomoes, Spanish missionary influence was being displaced, and the Viceroy was indifferent to colonization, but Portuguese settlements were not yet established.
Part of the northern boundary between Brazil and what was then British Guyana, was set by the Spanish Boundary-line Commission of Yturriaga and Solano (1757–1763). After two indecisive wars between Portuguese and Spanish colonial forces 1761–1763 and 1776–1777, the border between the Spanish and Portuguese possessions, the Viceroyalty of Peru (and successor states) and Grão-Pará region of Brazil, was set between 1781 and 1791 by negotiation.

===Age of rebellion===
In 1821, Grão-Pará and Rio Negro provinces became the unified &quot;Grão-Pará&quot;. The following year, Brazil proclaimed its independence and Grão-Pará became the province of Pará of state of Brazil.

When Emperor Pedro I declared independence from Portugal, in 1822, he had to fight also the provinces of Grão-Pará and Maranhão. In 1823, a ship commanded by British officer John Pascoe Grenfell arrived at the port of Belém, to combat rebels. Only in August 1824 did the new governor swear loyalty to the Brazilian Emperor.
The Province of Pará, including the &quot;comarca&quot; of Rio Negro, the upper Amazon region, was incorporated into the Empire of Brazil in 1824.

A revolt in 1832 demanded the autonomy of the Amazonas region as a separate province of Pará. The rebellion was suppressed, but the Amazons were able to send a representative to the Imperial Court, Friar José dos Santos Inocentes, who got up the creation of the District of the Upper Amazon. During Cabanagem in 1835–40, the Amazon remained loyal to the imperial government and not joined the revolt.

As a sort of reward for loyalty, the Province of Amazonas was officially created by Emperor Pedro II in 1850.

=== Rubber and economic exploitation ===

From the mid-19th century, the territory began to receive migrants from the northeast seeking a better life. Attracted by the rubber boom, they settled in important Amazonian cities such as Manaus, Tabatinga, Parintins, Itacoatiara and Barcelos, the first capital of Amazonas.
The state had an era of splendor in the 1890s, at the peak of the rubber boom. However, the economic gains were largely the result of great human suffering: untold thousands of enslaved Amerindian seringueiros (rubber tappers) died through disease and overwork.

Manaus, which already boasted as the capital administrative of the State, experienced a great population growth and the economic advancement, resulting mainly from exports of raw materials until then exclusively from Amazon Region. With the wealth generated by the production and export of natural rubber (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;), the amazonian capital received large works such as the port of Manaus, the Amazonas Opera House, Palace of Justice, Reservoir of Mocó, the first network of electric energy and public transport services as trams. Vista as a reference, your headquarters became a symbol of prosperity and civilization for the Amazonas State, being the center of important artistic and cultural events. Bloomed so trade in luxury products and superfluous, with men and women from all over the world parading its streets and avenues, at purchase of the so-called &quot;black gold&quot;, as was dubbed the natural rubber, to resell big profits in the main capitals of Europe and in the United States from 1910, difficult times began, due to the strong competition of natural rubber planted in rubber plantations the Asian continent, to European and American markets with superior advantages, which ultimately enact bankruptcy of Amazonian economy.
By the late 19th century, the Brazilian rubber monopoly was slowly dying, as British and Dutch plantations in South-East Asia were producing cheaper, superior quality rubber, and by 1900 the Amazonas state had fallen into serious economic decline.
===Free Economic Zone===
Free trade zone of Manaus (also called Manaus Industrial Pole or Industrial Pole of the Brazilian Amazon) was an economic development project implemented by Act number 3 173 of 3 June 1957, that reframed, enlarged and established tax incentives for deployment of an industrial, commercial and agricultural pole in a physical area of 10 000 km2, with headquarters in the city of Manaus. Despite the adoption in 1957, that project has only been in fact deployed, by Decree-Law number 288 of 28 February 1967.

The project was implemented by the Brazilian military government, at first, the benefits of this project was extended to the Western Amazon, formed by the States of Amazonas, Acre, Rondônia and Roraima. On August 20, 2008, the free trade area of Macapá, which was included in the Council of Manaus by Free Zone Superintendence (Suframa) and thus, the Amapá received the same benefit given for other Amazonian Brazilian States. The creation of the Manaus free trade zone aimed at promoting the occupation of this region population and raise the level of security to maintain your integrity in addition, brake deforestation in the region and recoup the preservation and sustainability of biodiversity present in the state. In its years of existence, the story of the Manaus Free Trade Zone is divided into four phases: the first, from 1967 to 1975, characterized the reference in the country&#x27;s industrial policy for the import substitution of final goods and formation of the internal market; the second, from 1975 to 1990, was characterized by the adoption of measures promoting the domestic industry inputs, especially in the State of São Paulo (largest consumer at the time); the third, in 1991 and 1996, came into force on new Industrial policy and foreign trade, marked by the opening of the Brazilian economy, reducing the import tax for the rest of the country and emphasis on quality and productivity, with the implementation of the Brazilian policy quality and productivity (PBPQ in Portuguese) and Industrial competitiveness program; and the fourth and last, of the 1996–2002, marks its adaptation to a globalized economy scenarios and the adjustments demanded by the effects of the Real plan, as the movement of privatization and deregulation.

==Geography==
Characterized by being the largest of the States of Brazil, with an area of . Amazonas has most of its land occupied by forest reserves and water. The access to the region is mainly made by waterway or by plane. It is located in the North of Brazil, bordering the States of Mato Grosso, Rondônia, and Acre to the South; Pará and Roraima, in the North East beyond the republics of Peru for 1,430 km along the Yavari river, Colombia for 1,644 km and Venezuela for 996 km to the Southwest and Northwest respectively. Most of its territory is in the time zone UTC−4 (with 4 hours less than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Thirteen municipalities in the West of the State are in the time zone UTC−5; it is one of the States of Brazil that contains two time zones in its territory. Amazonas is split by the Amazon river, the largest river by volume of water in the world. In the state, the river has several tributaries: Negro, Madeira, Purus, Japurá, Juruá, Içá or Putumayo and many other confluent. Most rivers are navigable for large ships.
===Climate===

The average temperature varies very little by season, between , the rainfall varies from 50 to 250 mm per month, averaging 2100 mm per year.
Most of the state is in the tropical rainforest climate zone, a type of tropical climate in which there is no dry season—all months have mean precipitation values of at least 60 mm. Its latitude is within five degrees of the equator—which is dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The equatorial climate is denoted Af in the Köppen climate classification.

=== Relief ===
The relief of the state is relatively low, since in the region, 85% does not surpass of altitude. The highest points of the state are the Pico da Neblina, with an approximate height of , followed by Pico Phelps or Pico 31 of March of , located in the border between Venezuela and Brazil, both mountains are in the municipality of Santa Isabel do Rio Negro and ironically, are the highest in Brazil.

===Vegetation===

Amazonas is almost entirely covered by the Amazon Rainforest, 98% according to officials, and it is divided into three types of habitat, viz:
* &quot;igapos&quot; – permanently flooded land, roots of vegetation always submerged
* &quot;varzeas&quot; – higher than &quot;igapos&quot;, land is only submerged when rivers are at their highest during the wet season
* low plateau – higher still, never submerged
The Amazon represents over half of the planet&#x27;s remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species-rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. More than of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest. and species are discovered on an almost daily basis.
The largest biodiversity of the planet is present across the State of Amazonas, generating great surprise in its visitors.

Amazonas economy was once reliant almost entirely upon rubber; today it has wide and varied industries, including the farming of cassava, oranges, and other agricultural products.

Recently the Brazilian government is pursuing the development of industries whose main focus will be the exporting of consumer goods. Due to its geographical proximity to the markets in the northern hemisphere and Amazon countries, like Venezuela, they believe this move will have a great economic impact not only in the north region of Brazil but in the entire country.

Over the last decades, a system of federal investments and tax incentives have turned the surrounding region into a major industrial center (the Free Economic Zone of Manaus). The mobile phone and game console companies Flextronics, LG and Sony run manufacturing plants in Manaus. Other major electronics and motorcycle manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics, Honda and Yamaha have plants as well.

<text>Ceará ( , , ) is one of the 26 states of Brazil, located in the northeastern part of the country, on the Atlantic coast. It is the eighth-largest Brazilian State by population and the 17th by area. It is also one of the main tourist destinations in Brazil. The state capital is the city of Fortaleza, the country&#x27;s fourth most populous city. The state has 4.3% of the Brazilian population and produces 2.1% of the Brazilian GDP. It is divided into 184 municipalities.

Literally, the name &quot;Ceará&quot; means &quot;sings the jandaia&quot;. According to José de Alencar, one of the most important writers of Brazil and an authority in Tupi Guaraní, &quot;Ceará&quot; means turquoise or green waters.

The state is best known for its extensive coastline, with of sand. There are also mountains and valleys producing tropical fruits. To the south, on the border of Paraíba, Pernambuco and Piauí, is the National Forest of Araripe.

== Geography ==
Ceará has an area of . It is bounded on the north by the Atlantic Ocean, on the east by the states of Rio Grande do Norte and Paraíba, on the south by Pernambuco state, and on the west by Piauí.

Ceará lies partly upon the northeast slope of the Brazilian Highlands, and partly upon the sandy coastal plain. Its surface is a succession of great terraces, facing north and northeast, formed by the denudation of the ancient sandstone plateau which once covered this part of the continent; the terraces are seamed by watercourses, and their valleys are broken by hills and ranges of highlands. The latter are the remains of the ancient plateau, capped with horizontal strata of sandstone, with a uniform altitude of . The flat top of such a range is called a &quot;chapada&quot; or &quot;taboleira&quot;, and its width in places is from . The boundary line with Piauí follows one of these ranges, the Serra de Ibiapaba, which unites with another range on the southern boundary of the state, known as the Serra do Araripe. Another range, or escarpment, crosses the state from east to west, but is broken into two principal divisions, each having several local names. These ranges are not continuous, the breaking down of the ancient plateau having been irregular and uneven.

The rivers of the state are small and, with one or two exceptions, become completely dry in the dry season. The largest is the Jaguaribe, which flows entirely across the state in a northeast direction.

Ceará has a varied environment, with mangroves, &quot;caatinga&quot;, jungle, scrubland and tropical forest. The higher ranges intercept considerable moisture from the prevailing trade winds, and their flanks and valleys are covered with a tropical forest which is typical of the region, gathering species from tropical forests, caatinga and cerrado. The less elevated areas of the plateaus are either thinly wooded or open campo. Most of the region at the lower altitudes is characterized by scrubby forests called &quot;caatingas&quot;, which is an endemic Brazilian vegetation. The sandy, coastal plain, with a width of , is nearly bare of vegetation, although the coast has many enclaves of &quot;restingas&quot; (coastal forests) and mangroves.

The soil is, in general, thin and porous and does not retain moisture; consequently, the long dry season turns the country into a barren desert, relieved only by vegetation along the riverways and mountain ranges, and by the hardy, widely distributed carnauba palm (&quot;Copernicia cerifera&quot;), which in places forms groves of considerable extent. Some areas in the higher ranges of Serra da Ibiapaba, Serra do Araripe and others are more appropriate for agriculture, as their soil and vegetation are less affected by the dry seasons.

The beaches of the state are a major tourist attraction. Ceará has several famous beaches such as Canoa Quebrada, Jericoacoara, Morro Branco, Taíba and Flexeiras. The beaches are divided into two groups (in relation to the capital Fortaleza): Sunset Coast (&quot;Costa do Sol poente&quot;) and Sunrise Coast (&quot;Costa do Sol nascente&quot;).

Ceará lies in one of the few regions of the country that experiences earthquakes. In 1980 an earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale struck near Quixeramobim in the center of the state, rattling the city of Fortaleza but causing no injuries.

===Climate===

The climate of Ceará is hot almost all year. The temperature in the state varies from . The coast is hot and humid, tempered by the cool trade winds; in the more elevated, semi-arid regions it is very hot and dry (often above , but seldom above ), although the nights are cool. In the higher ranges (Serra da Ibiapaba, Chapada do Araripe and several smaller highlands) the temperatures are cooler and vary from about . The record minimum temperature registered in Ceará was , recorded in Jardim, a small city in Chapada do Araripe.

The year is divided into a rainy and dry season, the rains beginning in January to March and lasting until June. The dry season, July to December, is sometimes broken by slight showers in September and October, but these are of slight importance. Sometimes the rains fail altogether, and then a drought (&quot;seca&quot;) ensues, causing famine and pestilence throughout the entire region. The most destructive droughts recorded in the 18th and 19th centuries were those of 1711, 1723, 1777–1778, 1790, 1825, 1844–1845, and 1877–1880, the last-mentioned (known by local people as &quot;a Grande Seca&quot;, &quot;the Great Drought&quot;) destroying nearly all the livestock in the state, and causing the death through starvation and pestilence of nearly half a million people, or over half the population. Because of the constant risk of droughts, many dams (called &quot;açudes&quot;) have been built throughout Ceará, the largest of them the Açude Castanhão. Because of the dams, the Jaguaribe River no longer dries up completely.

== Paleontology ==
The state contains outcrops of the Early Cretaceous Crato and Santana formations. In 2015, the earliest South American enantiornithine bird was described from the Aptian sediments of Crato Formation. The animal was named &quot;Cratoavis cearensis&quot;, after formation and state’s naming.

== History ==



The territory of Ceará was originally inhabited by different Indian peoples, such as the Tabajara, Potyguara, Anacés, Kariri, Inhamum, Jucá, Kanindé, Tremembé, Paicaú and others, who had commercial relations with various European people, including the French, before the Portuguese decided to include the area in Brazil.

The first Portuguese plan for settling in Ceará dated from 1534, but the first attempts to settle the territory failed, and the earliest Portuguese settlement was made near the mouth of the Ceará River in 1603, by Pero Coelho de Sousa. He established the fort of São Tiago, but one year later he and his family abandoned Ceará because of a period of drought, a natural phenomenon that periodically afflicts the province, which the Portuguese settlers were ill-equipped to endure.

Portugal wanted to form a military base in Ceará to support the Portuguese operations in the war against the French. The first attempt with Pero Coelho de Sousa, in 1603, was not successful, and the French continued operating from Maranhão and Ibiapaba, where they had established a base in 1590. The Indians and French formed political and military alliances. In 1607, two Jesuits, Francisco Pinto and Pereira Figueira, arrived in Ceará with a mission to spy in the area of Ibiapaba. In October, that year Francisco Pinto was killed by the Indians and Pereira Filgueira returned with more information about the area and the French and Indian alliance.

In 1612, the French were successfully expelled from Ceará and Maranhão by a military expedition under the command of Portuguese Martim Soares Moreno. In the same year he constructed the fortress of São Sebastião on the same site as São Tiago, and one year later he left Ceará for Portugal. It was only in 1618 that Martim Soares Moreno returned to Ceará, and it is from this time that the Portuguese presence dates. This was restricted at first to the area of the Ceará River: Martim Soares Moreno made an alliance with the Indians of the Potiguara tribe. In 1631, he left Ceará to help the Portuguese against the Dutch in Pernambuco and the fort of São Sebastião lost its importance.

At this time, what is today Brazil was hotly disputed by the Dutch and the Portuguese. The area was invaded twice by the Dutch, in 1637 and in 1649. In 1637, the Dutch and the Indians took the Fort of São Sebastião and dominated Ceará. The Dutch expanded their presence in Ceará and made alliances with different Indian tribes. In 1639, Georg Marcgrave made an expedition in Ceará, but in 1644 the Indians attacked the Dutch Governor of Ceará, Gideon Morris, the Dutch soldiers were killed, and São Sebastião was destroyed.

There were no Europeans in the region between 1644 and 1649, but in 1649, before negotiations with the different Indian tribes, Matias Beck arrived in Ceará to explore silver mines of Maranguape. Good-quality silver was not found however. In this period the Dutch built another fort, by the banks of river Pajeú, and named it Fort Schoonenborch after one of their commanders. In 1654, the Dutch were expelled from Brazil; the Portuguese took Schoonenborch, changed its name to Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora de Assunção (The Fortress of Our Lady of the Assumption), and the different Indian tribes that had made alliance with the Dutch had to flee from Portuguese persecution.

In 1661, the Netherlands formally ceded their Brazilian territories to the Portuguese crown, ending conflict in the region. Ceará became a dependency of Pernambuco in 1680; this relationship lasted until 1799, when the Captaincy of Ceará was made independent.

The fight for Brazilian independence in 1822 was fierce in Ceará, with the area being a rebel stronghold that incurred vicious retribution from loyalists. The captaincy became a province in 1822 under Dom Pedro I. A revolution followed in 1824, the president of the province was deposed fifteen days after his arrival, and a republic was proclaimed. Internal dissensions immediately broke out, the new president was assassinated, and after a brief reign of terror the province resumed its allegiance to the empire.

Ceará became the first province of Brazil to abolish slavery, on March 25, 1884, more than four years before the 1888 national law of abolition, passed by Princess Isabel.

The reign of Dom Pedro II (see Empire of Brazil) saw great advances in infrastructure in Ceará, with the commerce increasing by a large amount, and with gas lighting becoming almost ubiquitous.

The state of Ceará became a bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church in 1853, the bishop residing at Fortaleza.

Two railway lines running inland from the coast (the Baturité line from Fortaleza to Senador Pompeu, , and the Sobral line from the port of Camocim to Ipu, 134 miles), were built by the national government after the drought of 1877–1878 to give work to the starving refugees, and were later operated under leases. Dams were also built for irrigation purposes.

The population numbered 805,687 in 1890, and 849,127 in 1900. In 1900, approximately five-sixths of the population lived on estates, owned no property, paid no taxes, and derived few benefits from the social and political institutions about them. Education was then confined almost exclusively to the upper classes, from which came some of the most prominent men in Brazilian politics and literature.

In the early 20th century the sandy zone along the coast was nearly barren, but the more elevated region behind the coast with broken surfaces and sandy soil produced fruit and most tropical products when conditions were favourable. The natural vegetable production was important, and included manigoba or Ceará rubber, carnahuba wax and fibre, cashew wine and ipecacuanha. The principal agricultural products were cotton, coffee, sugar, manioc and tropical fruits. The production of cotton increased largely with the development of cotton manufacture in Brazil.

The higher plateau was devoted almost exclusively to cattle raising, once the principal industry of the state, although recurring droughts created an obstacle to its profitable development. The state exported considerable amounts of cattle, hides and skins.

Since 1960, the Orós Dam, comparable in size to the Aswan Dam has supplied Ceará with much of its water, and in 1995 construction began on the enormous Castanhão Dam, completed in 2003, which is able to hold 6.5 km3 of water.

==Politics and government==

Ceará is governed by the Governor of Ceará, currently Elmano de Freitas since 2023, and the Legislative Assembly of Ceará.

== Demographics ==
According to the IBGE of 2008, there were 8,472,000 people residing in the state. The population density was 55.2 inhabitants/km2.

Urbanization: 76.4% (2006); Population growth: 1.7% (1991–2000); Houses: 2,181,000 (2006).

The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 5,690,973 Brown (Multiracial) people (64.7%), 2,456,214 White people (27.9%), 595,694 Black people (6.8%), 39,982 Amerindian people (0.5%), 11,256 Asian people (0.1%).

===Religion===

Religion is very important in the culture of Ceará, being an extremely important factor in the construction of the identity of the people. Catholicism is the hegemony religion in Ceará and is the Christian confession that left most marks in Ceara&#x27;s culture. It was the only one recognized by the government until 1883, when the Presbyterian Church of Fortaleza was founded in the state capital. Roman Catholicism in Ceará presents several influences of indigenous beliefs. A large portion of traditional Christian manifestations in Ceará are strongly influenced by religious syncretism.

Throughout the 20th century, several churches were installed in the State and at the end of that century there was a considerable increase in people from other religions. However, Ceará is still the third Brazilian state with the highest proportion of Roman Catholics, 78.8% of the population, according to data from 2010 census. Evangelicals are 14.6%, Spiritists, 0.6%, members of other religions, 2.0%, and those without religion, 4.0%.

===Statistics===
Vehicles: 1,084,991 (March/2007);
Mobile phones: 3.5 million (April/2007); Telephones: 908 thousand (April/2007); Cities: 184 (2007).

==Economy==
The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 73.28%, followed by the industrial sector at 20.49%. Agriculture represents 6.23% of GDP (2021). Ceará exports: cast iron, iron and steel (53,08%), shoes and similar artifacts (13,12%), fruits (7,66%), mineral fuels and derived products (3,81%), fish, crustaceans and other aquatic invertebrates (3,68%) (2023). It is one of only three Brazilian states which together produce the world&#x27;s entire supply of carnauba wax.

Share of the Brazilian economy: 2,16% (2021).

According to the data from IPECE and IBGE, the GDP growth of the State of Ceará in 2021 was of 4.76%, while Brazil&#x27;s overall GDP grew 4,76% as well in the same year.

Traditionally an agriculture-based state, Ceará began an industrialisation program under the military regime (1964–1985), and the industrial sector continues to expand annually. In 1999, industry accounted for 39.3% of the state&#x27;s GDP. Tourism also plays a large role in Ceará&#x27;s economy, with the state&#x27;s many waterfalls, beaches and rainforests. On average, Fortaleza alone receives half a million tourists annually.

In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of cashew nuts, coconut, papaya, melon and beans.

The production of cashew in Brazil is carried out almost exclusively in the Northeast. The area occupied by cashew trees in Brazil in 2017 was estimated at 505,500 ha; of this total, 99.5% is located in the Northeast. The main producers in this region are Ceará (61.6% of the national area), Rio Grande do Norte and Piauí. However, Brazil, which in 2011 was the fifth largest world producer of cashew nuts, in 2016, fell to 14th position, with 1.5% of the total volume of nuts produced in the world. Vietnam, Nigeria, India and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire were the world&#x27;s largest cashew nut producers in 2016, with 70.6% of global production. In recent years, there has been increased competition with some African countries, where government programs have driven the expansion of culture and processing capacity. It is estimated that at 295 thousand tons per year the installed capacity for processing cashew nuts in the Northeast, however, the Region only managed to produce around a quarter of that quantity. Among the main world producers, Brazil has the lowest productivity. Several factors are pointed out as the cause of the low productivity and the fall in the Brazilian production of cashew nuts. One reason is that most orchards are in a phase of natural decline in production. In addition, the giant cashew trees, which are the majority in the Region, are exploited in an almost extractive manner, with low use of technology.

In 2017, the Northeast Region was the largest producer of coconut in the country, with 74.0% of national production. Bahia produced 351 million fruits, Sergipe, 234 million, and Ceará 187 million. However, the sector has been suffering strong competition and losing market to Indonesia, the Philippines and India, the world&#x27;s largest producers, who even export coconut water to Brazil. In addition to climatic problems, the low productivity of coconut palms in the Northeast Region is the result of factors related to the variety of coconut harvested and the technological level used in coastal regions. In these areas, the semi-extractive cultivation system still prevails, with low fertility and without the adoption of cultural management practices. The three states that have the largest production, Bahia, Sergipe and Ceará, present a yield three times lower than that of Pernambuco, which is in 5th place in the national production. This is because most of the coconut trees in these three states are located in coastal areas and cultivated in semi-extractivist systems.

In 2018, the South Region was the main producer of beans with 26.4% of the total, followed by the Midwest (25.4%), Southeast Region (25.1%), Northeast (20.6%) and North (2.5%). The largest producers in the Northeast were Ceará and Bahia.

In cassava production, Brazil produced a total of 17.6 million tons in 2018. Maranhão was the 7th largest producer in the country, with 681 thousand tons. Ceará was 9th, with 622 thousand tons. In total, the northeast produced 3,5 million tons.

Rio Grande do Norte is the largest producer of melon in the country. In 2017 it produced 354 thousand tons. The Northeast region accounted for 95.8% of the country&#x27;s production in 2007. In addition to Rio Grande do Norte, which in 2005 produced 45.4% of the country&#x27;s total, the other 3 largest in the country were Ceará, Bahia and Pernambuco.

In the production of papaya, in 2018 Bahia was the 2nd largest producer state in Brazil, almost equaling with Espírito Santo. Ceará was in 3rd place and Rio Grande do Norte in 4th place.

In the production of banana, in 2018 Ceará was the 8th largest national producer, with 408 thousand tons.

The state stands out nationally in raising goats and sheep. In 2016, Ceará had the fourth largest herd of goats in the country, with 1.13 million heads. The state occupied the same position in the herd of sheep, with 2.31 million animals.

Ceará&#x27;s cattle herd is small compared to other states in Brazil. In 2019, it had 2.4 million heads. Milk production was 705 million liters this year.

In 2017, the Northeast was the largest shrimp producer in the country. National production was 41 thousand tons. Rio Grande do Norte (37.7%) and Ceará (28.9%) were the largest producers. Aracati, in Ceara, was the municipality with the highest participation.
About industry, Ceará had in 2017 an industrial GDP of R$ 22.2 billion, equivalent to 1.9% of the national industry. It employs 296,734 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Construction (26.2%), Industrial Public Utility Services, such as Electricity and Water (22.5%), Food (11.0%), Leather and footwear (10.5%) and Clothing (5.5%). These 5 sectors concentrate 75.7% of the state&#x27;s industry.

The main sectors of the Ceará industry are clothing, food, metallurgy, textiles, chemicals and footwear. Most of the industries are installed in the Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza, where the Industrial District of Maracanaú is located. In São Gonçalo do Amarante, a steel mill is installed, Companhia Siderúrgica do Pecém, which in 2018 produced 2.9 million tons of crude steel, of the 35.4 million produced in the country.

Some of the large companies in Ceará with national reach are: Aço Cearense (steel), Companhia de Alimentos do Nordeste (food), Grendene (footwear), Café Santa Clara (coffee), Grande Moinho Cearense (mill), Edson Queiroz Group (business conglomerate, works with gas, mineral water, household appliances, communications, education, among others), Naval Industry of Ceará, J. Macêdo, M. Dias Branco (food company that manufactures, markets and distributes cookies, pasta, cakes, snacks, wheat flour, margarine and vegetable fats) and Ypióca.

The state is generally poor. According to 2013 data, 396,370 people live in slums in Fortaleza. Fortaleza has the 2nd largest population in a slum among cities in the Northeast. 31.6% of residents have income per capita up to half the minimum wage. The state&#x27;s productivity is small.

==Tourism and recreation==

Fortaleza&#x27;s international airport (Pinto Martins airport) is served by international flights from North and Central America as well as Europe.

The beach of Cumbuco, located in the municipality of Caucaia (neighbour to Fortaleza), is considered one of the best places in the world for the practicing of kitesurfing.

Jericoacoara National Park is a windswept region, with local fisherman mixing it with travellers keen to get off the beaten track – and provides a local relaxed atmosphere, incredible forro dancing and music and Capoeira with famous kite and windsurfing adventures, sand buggy tours to the stunning Lagoa Azul nearby, and interesting opportunities available including following the shamans path into the experiences of Ayahuasca – often viewed as one of the most effective tools of enlightenment.

===Main tourist attractions===

* Guaramiranga Mountains
* Canoa Quebrada Beach (in Aracati)
* Morro Branco
* Praia Do Futuro
* Jericoacoara Beach (profiled on E! Network&#x27;s &quot;Wild On!&quot; series in 2000)

==Infrastructure==

===International airport===

The Pinto Martins International Airport is situated in Fortaleza. The passenger terminal is air conditioned and has four levels. The basement level has parking for 1,000 cars as well as automatic teller machines and a stop for regular city buses.

The ground level has 31 check-in counters, airline offices, car rental agencies, special tourist information, a juvenile court bureau to facilitate travel of minors, a National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) office, information counter, passenger arrival area and access to two taxi stops.

The second level contains shops, a food court and domestic and international boarding lounges. The top floor has a beer garden and panoramic deck overlooking the maneuvering apron with a view of the Fortaleza skyline. The apron is 152,857 square meters and can accommodate 14 aircraft at once in pre-established positions (&quot;boxes&quot;).

The scheduled airlines operating out of Fortaleza are Cabo Verde Airlines, TAP, Delta Air Lines, Gol, TAM, Webjet, OceanAir and TAF. The airport also frequently receives domestic and international charter flights. The passenger terminal, opened in 1998, was designed to have a useful life of 50 years. The former terminal, called the General Aviation Terminal, is now used for general aviation and the fire brigade. The control tower is located alongside.

Construction of a cargo terminal is the next big step planned by Infraero. The new terminal will have roughly eight thousand square meters, boosting the cargo storage and handling capacity fourfold. Plans then call for the new terminal to be integrated with highway and railroad links.

===Highways===

Highways in Ceará include:

<text>Mato Grosso ( – ) is one of the states of Brazil, the third largest by area, located in the Central-West region. The state has 1.66% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for 1.9% of the Brazilian GDP.

Neighboring states (from west clockwise) are: Rondônia, Amazonas, Pará, Tocantins, Goiás and Mato Grosso do Sul. It is divided into 142 municipalities and covers an area of 903,357 square kilometers, 
consequently the state is roughly 82.2% of the size of its southwest neighbor, the nation of Bolivia. A state with a flat landscape that alternates between vast &quot;chapadas&quot; and plain areas, Mato Grosso contains three main ecosystems: the Cerrado, the Pantanal and the Amazon rainforest.

The Chapada dos Guimarães National Park, with its caves, grottoes, tracks, and waterfalls, is one of its tourist attractions. The extreme northwest of the state has a small part of the Amazonian forest. The Xingu Indigenous Park and the Araguaia River are in Mato Grosso. Farther south, the Pantanal, the world&#x27;s largest wetland, is the habitat for nearly one thousand species of animals and many aquatic birds.

==Geography==
The varied terrain of Mato Grosso includes cliffs, canyons, and waterfalls. It is home to the Chapada dos Guimarães National Park, its sandstone mountains have eroded into a remarkably varied vistas.

The biologically rich Pantanal, one of the world&#x27;s largest wetland/prairie ecosystems, is also located within this state. The Paraguay basin is rich in the number and diversity of fish (around 230 species), a fascinating place for fishermen and scholars. In this basin are numerous species classified as &quot;noble&quot; in sport fishing, others, including ornamental species, are of great interest to aquarists and still others whose rarity has led to detailed research. The fishing industry in the Pantanal plays an important role in the region&#x27;s economy and, for local people, fish is a staple food. The Pantanal has a habitat similar to the Everglades in Florida in the United States, although the Pantanal is much larger.

==History==

The Bororo Indians live in the Mato Grosso area. As late as 1880, soldiers patrolled lands on the outskirts of Cuiabá, Mato Grosso&#x27;s capital and largest city, to protect settlers from Bororo raids.

By the end of the 19th century, although severely reduced by disease and by warfare with explorers, slave traders, prospectors, settlers, and other indigenous groups, as many as five to 10 thousand Bororo continued to occupy central and eastern Mato Grosso, as well as western Goiás. The southwestern part of this state was ceded by Brazil to Bolivia in exchange for the then-Bolivian territory of Acre, according to the Treaty of Petrópolis in 1903.

This historically remote area attracted expeditions of exploration in the early 20th century that sought to find lost civilizations. A notable example was British Captain Percy Fawcett&#x27;s expedition to find the Lost City of Z which he believed existed in the jungles of Brazil. Certain proponents of the Hollow Earth hypothesis speculated that the region had sites of access to the interior of the earth and its settlements.

In 1977, the state was split into two halves, and the neighboring state of Mato Grosso do Sul was created from the other part of its territory.

== Demographics ==
Mato Grosso had a high rate of population growth in the 20th century due to timber, ranching and agricultural development. The state as a whole has one of the lowest population densities of any Brazilian state. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), 3,441,998 people resided in the state as of 2018. The population density was 3.8 inhabitants/km2.

*Urbanization: 76.6% (2006)
*Population growth: 2.4% (1991–2000)
*Houses: 836,000 (2006)

Ethnically, the state includes a relatively high proportion of caboclos (persons of mixed European and Indian ancestry), as do other areas of interior Brazil. The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 2,048,782 Brown (Mixed) people (56%); 1,181,590 White people (32.3%); 360,698 Black people (9.9%); 56,687 Amerindian people (1.5%); and 10,813 Asian people (0.3%).
At the 2022 census, the most commonly nominated ethnic groups as a proportion of the total population were:

<text>Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse, (9 November 1884 – 4 August 1917) was an English medical doctor, Olympic athlete, and British Army officer from the Chavasse family. He is one of three people to be awarded a Victoria Cross twice, the others being Arthur Martin-Leake and Charles Upham.

The Battle of Guillemont saw acts of heroism by Chavasse, the only man to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice during the First World War. In 1916, he was hit by shell splinters while rescuing men in no-man&#x27;s land. It is said he got as close as 25 yards to the German line, where he found three men and continued throughout the night under a constant rain of sniper bullets and bombing. He performed similar heroics in the early stages of the offensive at Passchendaele in August 1917 to gain a second VC and become the most highly decorated British officer of the First World War. He died of wounds suffered at Passchendaele in 1917.

==Childhood==
Noel Godfrey Chavasse was the younger of identical twin boys born to the Rev. Francis Chavasse (later Bishop of Liverpool and founder of St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford) and Edith Jane Chavasse (née Maude) on 9 November 1884 at 36 New Inn Hall Street, Oxford. Christopher Maude was born 20 minutes before his brother. In all, there were seven children born to the Chavasse family, in age order: Dorothea, Christopher, Noel, Edith, Mary, Francis and Aidan. The twins were so small and weak at birth that their baptism was delayed until 29 December 1884, and both were very ill with typhoid in their first year of life.

Chavasse was educated at Magdalen College School in Cowley Place, Oxford, where a blue plaque was dedicated to him in 2005, Liverpool College and Trinity College, Oxford. The family grew up in Oxford until, on 3 March 1900, Francis Chavasse was offered the Anglican Bishopric of Liverpool. The move was not without regrets as Liverpool during this time was one of the busiest seaports in the Empire and had a great deal of religious turmoil. The family moved to the Bishop&#x27;s Palace at 19 Abercromby Square, Liverpool. Noel and Christopher went to school at Liverpool College, where they excelled at sports from the start. Their academic progress was initially rather slower, but as they grew older, both did well until, in 1904, both were admitted to Trinity College, Oxford.

==University and early professional career==
In 1907, Noel graduated with First-class honours but Christopher failed, leading to a nervous breakdown. Both of them stayed at Oxford, Noel to study medicine and Christopher to retake his exams. During their time at Trinity, both men had not neglected their sports, rugby union being a favourite of theirs. In 1908, both twins represented Great Britain in the Olympic Games in the 400 metres. Noel finished third in his heat while Christopher finished second, but only the heat winners progressed to the semi-finals.

In January 1909, Noel joined the Oxford University Officers&#x27; Training Corps Medical Unit. By the following May, he was promoted to lance-sergeant. Noel finished his studies at Oxford in July 1909 and returned to Liverpool to continue his studies under such eminent teachers as Sir Robert Jones, who went on to become a leading authority in orthopaedic surgery.

On returning to Liverpool, Chavasse resumed his connection with the Grafton Street Industrial School, an institution for homeless boys in Liverpool. In the autumn, he went to London to sit his examination for Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons. He failed, apparently because of ill health. When he sat the examination again in May 1910, he passed it with ease. In the meantime, Christopher was well into his studies for the ministry under his father&#x27;s guidance. Noel progressed through his studies, having studied pathology and bacteriology. He was obliged to undertake a hospital &quot;placement&quot; as part of his course. He found a position at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin. Whilst Chavasse liked Dublin, his first experience of coming into contact with Roman Catholic clergy disturbed him.

In January 1912, Chavasse passed his final medical examination and was awarded the university&#x27;s premier medical prize, the Derby Exhibition, in March of that year. On 22 July 1912, he registered as a doctor with the General Medical Council. His first placement was at the Royal Southern Hospital in Liverpool, initially until 31 March 1913, and then for a further six months. He then became house surgeon to Robert Jones, his former tutor.

==Military career and decorations==
In early 1913, after discussions with some of his fellow doctors, Chavasse applied for and was accepted by the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC); he was commissioned as a lieutenant on 2 June. Thanks to one of his mentors, Dr McAlistair, who was then Surgeon-Captain of the 10th Battalion of the King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment), the Liverpool Scottish, he was attached to the battalion as Surgeon-Lieutenant. The 10th Kings had been a Territorial battalion since the Haldane Reforms in 1909. Chavasse joined the battalion on 2 June 1913 and was welcomed by Lieutenant-Colonel W. Nicholl, the commanding officer. As an officer in a Territorial unit, Chavasse now had to attend to both his civilian and military duties.

During the First World War, Chavasse was a captain with the Royal Army Medical Corps, British Army attached to the 1/10th (Scottish) Battalion of the King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment), part of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division.

Chavasse was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry at Hooge, Belgium in June 1915, although the award was not gazetted until 14 January 1916. He was promoted captain on 1 April 1915; on 30 November 1915 that year he was Mentioned in Despatches.

===Victoria Cross===

Chavasse was first awarded the VC for his actions on 9 August 1916, at Guillemont, France, when he attended to the wounded all day under heavy fire. The full
citation was published on 24 October 1916 and read:

===Bar to Victoria Cross===
Chavasse&#x27;s second award was made during the period 31 July to 2 August 1917, at Wieltje, Belgium; the full citation was published on 14 September 1917 and read:

Chavasse died of his wounds in Brandhoek and is buried at Brandhoek New Military Cemetery, Vlamertinge. His military headstone carries, uniquely, a representation of two Victoria Crosses.

Chavasse was the only man to be awarded both a Victoria Cross and Bar in the First World War and one of only three men ever to have achieved this distinction.
==Personal life==

At the time of his death, Chavasse was engaged to one of his cousins, Frances Gladys Ryland Chavasse, daughter of his uncle Sir Thomas Frederick Chavasse of Bromsgrove, a surgeon. Noel&#x27;s engagement is mentioned on a plaque at the Chavasse family grave at Bromsgrove. Gladys Chavasse was mentioned in despatches 1945 at Monte Cassino, Italy, and killed in 1962 in an accident in France while crossing the road.

Noel&#x27;s nephew – Christopher Chavasse&#x27;s son – was named in his honour and served as an aide to Bernard Montgomery, as well as being awarded the Military Cross in the Second World War.

==Commemorations==

Chavasse is believed to be commemorated by more war memorials in the UK than any other individual. Sixteen have currently been recorded by the UK National Inventory of War Memorials.

Chavasse&#x27;s medals, which had been left by his family to St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford (which had been founded by his father; his brother Christopher was its first Master), were purchased in 2009 by Lord Ashcroft for around £1.5 million, a world record price. The medals, along with others, are displayed in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum.

Chavasse Park in Liverpool city centre was named in honour of the Chavasse family; Francis (2nd Bishop of Liverpool) and his twin sons Christopher Maude Chavasse (an Olympic athlete and later Bishop of Rochester), and Noel Godfrey Chavasse.

A hospital ward is named after him at the Walton Centre in Liverpool.

One of the houses at Magdalen College School is named in honour of him.

There are two World War One Victoria Cross paving stones (each depicting a pair of crosses) dedicated to Chavasse in Oxford: one outside St Peter&#x27;s College and one near Magdalen College School.

A bronze memorial (the &#x27;Liverpool Heroes Memorial&#x27;) commemorating Chavasse and fifteen other Liverpool-born Victoria Cross recipients has been erected at Abercromby Square in Liverpool. It was sculpted by Tom Murphy.

In 2017, Noel Chavasse was featured on a £5 coin (issued in silver and gold) in a six-coin set commemorating the centenary of the First World War produced by the Royal Mint.

<text>Mato Grosso do Sul ( ) is one of Brazil&#x27;s 27 federal units, located in the southern part of the Central-West Region, bordering five Brazilian states: Mato Grosso (to the north), Goiás and Minas Gerais (northeast), São Paulo (east) and Paraná (southeast); and two South American countries: Paraguay (south and southwestern) and Bolivia (west). It is divided into 79 municipalities and covers an area of 357,145.532 square kilometers, which is about the same size as Germany. With a population of 2,839,188 inhabitants in 2021, Mato Grosso do Sul is the 21st most populous state in Brazil.

Campo Grande is the capital and largest city of Mato Grosso do Sul. The economy of the state is largely based on agriculture and cattle-raising. Crossed in the south by the Tropic of Capricorn, Mato Grosso do Sul generally has a warm, sometimes hot, and humid climate, and is crossed by numerous tributaries of the Paraná River. The state has 1.3% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for 1.5% of the Brazilian GDP. Mato Grosso do Sul is also known for its natural environment, and is a destination for domestic and international tourism. The Pantanal lowlands cover 12 municipalities and presents a variety of flora and fauna, with forests, natural sand banks, savannahs, open pasture, fields and bushes. The city Bonito, in the mountain of Bodoquena, has prehistoric caves, natural rivers, waterfalls, swimming pools and the Gruta do Lago Azul cave.

The name &quot;Mato Grosso do Sul&quot; is Portuguese for &quot;Southern Thick Bush&quot;; the name is inherited from its northern neighbour state of Mato Grosso, from which it was split on 1 January 1979. The state is still commonly referred to as &quot;Mato Grosso&quot; in colloquial speech. Other names that were proposed, at the time of the split and afterwards, include &quot;Pantanal&quot; (a reference to its best known geographical feature) and &quot;Maracaju&quot; (a reference to the Maracaju Mountain Range that crosses the state from north to south).

==Geography==
=== Climate ===

Mato Grosso do Sul has humid subtropical and tropical climates. The average annual rainfall is 1471.1 mm. January is the warmest month, with mean maximum of 34 °C (93.2 °F) and minimum of 24 °C (75.2 °F) and more rain; July experiences the coldest temperatures, with mean maximum of 25 °C (77 °F) and minimum of -2,0 °C (28 °F) and sun.

===Vegetation===
The &quot;cerrado&quot; landscape is characterized by extensive savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys. Cerrado includes various types of vegetation. Humid fields and &quot;buriti&quot; palm paths are found where the water table is near the surface. Alpine pastures occur at higher altitudes and mesophytic forests on more fertile soils. The &quot;cerrado&quot; trees have characteristic twisted trunks covered by a thick bark, and leaves which are usually broad and rigid. Many herbaceous plants have extensive roots to store water and nutrients. The plant&#x27;s thick bark and roots serve as adaptations for the periodic fires which sweep the cerrado landscape. The adaptations protect the plants from destruction and make them capable of sprouting again after the fire.

The state is located in western Brazil, in a region mostly occupied by the inland marshes of the Pantanal. The highest elevation is the 1,065 m high Morro Grande.

==History==
In the 1630s, the Jesuits also established short-lived missions among the Guaraní people in the Itatín region of present-day Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. They were destroyed by Bandeirantes and revolts by the indigenous people.

The first peoples or indigenous peoples of Mato Grosso do Sul, particularly occupying the Nhande Ru Marangatu tropical rainforested area, are the Guarani-Kaiowá, first contacted by non-indigenous peoples in the 1800s.

On October 11, 1977, the state was created by dividing the state of Mato Grosso. Its status as a state went into full effect two years later on January 1, 1979. The new state also incorporated the entirety of the former territory of Ponta Porã.

== Demographics ==
According to the IBGE of 2008, there were 2,372,000 people residing in the state. The population density was 6.4 inhabitants/km2.

Urbanization: 84.7% (2006); Population growth: 1.7% (1991–2000); Houses: 689,000 (2006)

The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 1,293,797 Brown (Multiracial) people (46.9%), 1,168,407 White people (42.4%), 179,101 Black people (6.5%), 96,029 Amerindian people (3.5%), 19,616 Asian people (0.7%).

In the Cerrado areas, mostly in the south, central and east, there is a predominance of Southern Brazilian farmers of Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian and Slavic descent.

According to an autosomal DNA study from 2008, the ancestral composition of Mato Grosso do Sul is 73,60% European, 13,90% African and 12,40% Native American. Additionally, according to a different 2013 DNA study, the ancestral composition of Mato Grosso do Sul is: 58.8% European, 25.9% Amerindian and 15.3% African ancestries, respectively.

===Industry===
Mato Grosso do Sul had an industrial GDP of R $19.1 billion in 2017, equivalent to 1.6% of the national industry. It employs 122,162 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Public Utility Industrial Services, such as Electricity and Water (23.2%), Construction (20.8%), Food (15.8%), Pulp and Paper (15.1%) and Petroleum Derivatives and Biofuels (12.5%). These 5 sectors concentrate 87.4% of the state&#x27;s industry.

In the city of Três Lagoas, the production of paper and cellulose is considerable. Mato Grosso do Sul recorded growth above the national average in the production of cellulose, reached the mark of 1 million hectares of planted eucalyptus, expanded its industrial park in the sector and consolidated itself as the largest exporter of the product in the country in the first quarter of 2020.

In BR-163 there were about 120 km of duplicated highways in 2022, with future planning to have a total of 847 km of duplications, crossing the entire state. Other important highways in the state are BR-262, BR-060 and BR-267. As it is a state that only became more populated in the 1970s, its transport network is in a clear process of evolution, and it continues to be a low-density road network.

The state also has two railway lines: the Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil, which connects the center-west of the state of São Paulo with the city of Corumbá, in Mato Grosso do Sul, on the Paraguay River, with 1,330 kilometers in length; and Ferrovia Norte Brasil, which has connected the city of Santa Fé do Sul with Rondonópolis since 1989, being one of the main corridors for the flow of grain in the region, with 755 kilometers connect the northwest of São Paulo with the south of Mato Grosso.

River navigation, once again important, is losing its pre-eminence. Two fluvial axes make up the state, both belonging to the Río de la Plata basin. The Paraguay River integrates the state with the neighboring countries Paraguay and Argentina, and with Mato Grosso through the port of Cáceres. The main products transported by the river are: iron and manganese ores, cement, wood, petroleum derivatives and cattle. In 1999, this waterway began transporting sugar, departing from Porto Murtinho. The main ports are Corumbá (Corumbá, Ladário and Porto Esperança) and Porto Murtinho. Finally, the Paraná-Tieté Waterway runs through the Paraná River.

About international Airports:

* Campo Grande - The operation of Campo Grande International Airport is shared with the Campo Grande Air Base. The airport has two runways. Construction of the main runway, made of concrete, began in 1950 and was finished in 1953. The passenger terminal was concluded in 1964, and in 1967 concrete aprons were built for both military and civilian aircraft. As commercial aviation demand grew, it became necessary to widen the civil aircraft apron, which was completed 12 years after its construction. The airport has been administered by Infraero since 1975.
* Corumbá - Corumbá International Airport, located just 3 km (1.86 mi) from the city center, was opened on September 21, 1960, the city&#x27;s anniversary. Built on a land plot of 290 hectares and at an elevation of 140 meters above sea, it has an asphalt runway measuring 1660 x 30 meters, with one of its thresholds reinforced with concrete for an additional 60 meters.

<text>Pará () is a state of Brazil, located in northern Brazil and traversed by the lower Amazon River. It borders the Brazilian states of Amapá, Maranhão, Tocantins, Mato Grosso, Amazonas and Roraima. To the northwest are the borders of Guyana and Suriname, to the northeast of Pará is the Atlantic Ocean. The capital and largest city is Belém, which is located at the Marajó bay, near the estuary of the Amazon river. The state, which is home to 4.1% of the Brazilian population, is responsible for just 2.2% of the Brazilian GDP.

Pará is the most populous state of the North Region, with a population of over 8.6 million, being the ninth-most populous state in Brazil. It is the second-largest state of Brazil in area, at , second only to Amazonas upriver. Its most famous icons are the Amazon River and the Amazon rainforest. Pará produces rubber (extracted from rubber tree groves), cassava, açaí, pineapple, cocoa, black pepper, coconut, banana, tropical hardwoods such as mahogany, and minerals such as iron ore and bauxite. A new commodity crop is soy, cultivated in the region of Santarém.

Every October, Belém receives tens of thousands of tourists for the year&#x27;s most important religious celebration: the procession of the Círio de Nazaré. Another important attraction of the capital is the Marajó-style ceramics, based on the vanished Marajoara culture, which developed on that very large island in the Amazon River.

==Etymology==
The state&#x27;s name is a toponym of the Tupi word &quot;pará&quot; – literally &quot;sea&quot;, but sometimes used to refer to large rivers. The state was named after the river of the same name, the Pará River, one of the tributaries of the Amazon River.

== History ==
In 1500, the Spanish navigator Vicente Yáñez Pinzón was the first European to navigate the mouth of the Amazon River. On 26 August 1542, the Spaniard Francisco de Orellana reached the mouth of the Amazon River waterway, by river from Quito, Ecuador. On 28 October 1637, the Portuguese Pedro Teixeira left Belém and went to Quito: during the expedition, he placed a landmark in the confluence of the Napo and Aguarico, in the current border between Ecuador and Peru, to Portugal, and later to Brazil, getting the possession of most of the Amazon, including all of the current territory of Pará.

===Prior to European Arrival===

Archaeologists divide the ancient inhabitants of prehistory Brazil into groups according to their way of life and tools: hunter-gatherers of the coast and farmers. These groups were subsequently named by European settlers as &quot;Indians&quot;. There are archaeological records proving the human presence in Brazil and the region of Santarém since 3000 BC.

Marajó people lived in farmers&#x27; huts or houses 3,500 years ago. These people knew ceramics, dyes, natural medicinal compounds; practiced slash-and-burn (to clear the land); and planted cassava. A reminder of their culture remains in Marajoara pottery, which has peculiar size and decoration. The period from 500 to 1300 was the height of the Marajoara culture.

===Formation of Grão-Pará and Maranhão===

The region of the Amazon valley, by the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), was in possession of the Spanish Crown, the Portuguese expeditionaries, with the purpose of consolidating the region as Portuguese territory, founded the Fort of the Nativity (Forte do Presépio) in 1616, in Santa Maria de Belém do Grão-Pará (Saint Mary of Bethlehem of the Great Pará). The building was the first of the model on Amazon and the most significant in the Amazon territory until 1660. Despite the construction of fort, the occupation of territory was marked by early Dutch and English incursions in search of spices, hence the need of the Portuguese to fortify the area.

In the 17th century, the region, integrated into the captaincy of Maranhão, was prosperous with crops and livestock. In 1616 the captaincy of Grão-Pará was created, belonging to the Portuguese colonial state of Maranhão. In the same year the state of Grão-Pará and Maranhão transferred capital to Belém, forming and attaching the captaincy of Rio Negro in 1755 by creating the State of Grão-Pará and Rio Negro.

In 1751, with the expansion to the west, the colonial state of Grão-Pará, which besides the captaincy of Grão Pará would host the captaincy of São José do Rio Negro (today the State of Amazonas).

In 1823, the Pará decided to join the independent Brazil, which had been separated during the colonial period, reporting directly to Lisbon. However, political infighting continued. The most important of them, the Cabanagem (1835), decreed the independence of the province of Pará. This was, along with the Ragamuffin War, the only to lift the regency period when the power was taken. Cabanagem was the only revolt led by the popular strata.

===Cabanagem===
Cabanagem, a popular and social revolt during the Empire of Brazil, in the Amazon region, was influenced by the French Revolution. It was mainly due to extreme poverty, hunger and disease that devastated the Amazon at the beginning of the period, in the former province of Grão-Pará, which included the current Amazonian states of Pará, Amazonas, Amapá, Roraima and Rondônia. The revolt spread from 1835 until January 1840, due to the process of independence of Brazil (1822), which did not occur immediately in the province due to political irrelevance to which the region was relegated by Prince Regent Pedro I. After independence, the strong Portuguese influence remained stable, giving political irrelevance in this province to the Brazilian central government.

Indians, blacks, and mestizos (mostly poor class members), all named cabanos (cabins), teamed against the Regent Government and rebelled, to increase the importance of the region in Brazil&#x27;s central government addressing the issue of poverty as one of the reasons. All lived in mud huts (hence the name of the revolt). At the bottom of the rebellion, there was a mobilization of the Brazilian Empire against the reactionary forces of the province of Grão-Pará in expelling the insurgents who wanted to keep the region as a Portuguese colony or territory independent. Many of the local leaders, who resented the lack of political participation in decisions of the centralizer of the Brazil government, contributed to the climate of dissatisfaction against the provincial government.

===Rubber cycle and mineral extraction===
After the revolt, the local economy grew rapidly during the 19th century and early 20th century by exploitation of rubber, the latex, by extracting it. At this period the Amazon experienced two distinct economic cycles with the exploitation of the same raw material.

The intendant Antônio Lemos was the main character of the urban transformation that Belém experienced, which came to be known as Paris n’America (Paris in the America), as a reference to the influence of the urbanization that Paris had experienced at the time, which served as the inspiration for Antônio Lemos.

During this period, for example, the city center was heavily lined with mango trees transported from India and development inspired by the model of Paris. With the decline of the two cycles of rubber (1870–1920 and 1940–1945), came a distressing economic stagnation, which stopped in the 1960s and 1970s, with the development of agricultural activities in the south of the state. From the decade of 1960s, but mainly in the 1970s, growth was accelerating with the exploitation of minerals mainly in the southeastern region of the state, as with iron extraction in the Serra dos Carajás and the Serra Pelada gold.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

A tropical rainforest climate is a type of tropical climate in which there is no dry season — all months have mean precipitation values of at least . It is usually found at latitudes within five degrees of the equator — which are dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The equatorial climate is denoted &quot;Af&quot; in the Köppen climate classification.

=== Vegetation ===
The Amazon represents over half of the planet&#x27;s remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tracts of tropical rainforest in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. More than one-third of all species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest The largest biodiversity of the planet is present across the state of Pará.

== Political subdivisions ==
The state is divided into 144 municipalities.
The largest cities by population (2016) are:
*Belém 1,446,042
*Ananindeua 510,834
*Santarém 294,447
*Marabá 272,172

== Demographics ==
According to the IBGE of 2022, there were 8,120,131 people residing in the state. The population density was . Urbanization: 75.2% (2006); Population growth: 2.5% (1991–2000); Houses: 1,754,000 (2006).

The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 5,673,446 Brown (Multiracial) people (69.9%), 1,570,281 White people (19.3%), 793,621 Black people (9.8%), 69,180 Amerindian people (0.9%), 12,432 Asian people (0.2%).

=== Ethnic groups ===
The majority of the population is mixed, due to the large indigenous population and, to a lesser amount, those with African ancestry. In the last IBGE census (2010), 817,000 Brazilians classified themselves as indigenous, about 0.26% percent of the country&#x27;s population.

Pará has attracted numerous Portuguese, Spanish, and Japanese immigrants. They have told their stories in a permanent space, the &quot;Room Vicente Salles&quot; of the &quot;Memorial of the People&quot;, in Belém. The Portuguese colonists were followed by Spaniards fleeing wars and social unrest due to political disputes in the Iberian Peninsula. The Japanese have become established in agrarian communities, settling in towns such as Tomé-Açu.

Portuguese explorers and missionaries settled in the state in the 17th century. In January 1616, the Portuguese captain, Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco began the occupation of the land, founding the Fort of the Nativity, nucleus of the future state capital. Portuguese religious missions were used to establish settlements between here and the Fort St. Louis of Maranhão. Most settlers sailed up the Amazon River as travel overland was extremely arduous. The Portuguese were the first to arrive in Pará, leaving contributions ranging from cuisine to architecture.

The first Japanese immigrants who settled in the Amazon left the Port of Kobe in Japan, on July 24, 1926, and reached the city of Tomé-Açu, on 22 September of that year, with stops in Rio de Janeiro and Belém.

The Japanese introduced crops such as jute and black pepper in the 1930s; jute was so successful that it drove a boom in the regional economy. In the 1970s, Japanese farmers introduced cultivation of Hawaiian papaya and melon, for which there is international demand. The third largest ethnic Japanese community in Brazil is in Pará, with about 13,000 inhabitants (surpassed only by settlements in the states of São Paulo and Paraná). They live mainly in the cities of Tomé-Açu, Santa Izabel do Pará, and Castanhal.

Italian immigrants in Pará came predominantly from the south of Italy, originating in Calabria, Campania and Basilicata. It was a time of a wave of emigration. They were all settlers and devoted to trade. The first Italian trade was recorded in 1888 in Santarém. The immigrants planted family roots in Belém, Breves, Abaetetuba, Óbidos, Oriximiná, Santarém and Alenquer. The presence in western Pará was so pronounced that the Consulate of Italy established an office in Óbidos, which is the largest city populated by Italians in the state. The consulate was in Recife, Pernambuco.

In Belém, the Italians worked in commercial and retail services. They were important during the beginning of the industrialization of the state capital (1895). According to the 1920 census, about 1,000 Italians lived in Pará. At the end of World War II, another wave of Italian immigrants arrived after the persecution of Japanese, Italians, and Germans. Similar to French immigrants, this wave of Italians did not remain in Pará.

Lebanese immigrants arrived in Pará in the mid-19th century, at the time of the rubber boom, and through 1914. There were between 15,000 and 25,000 Syrian-Lebanese immigrants, of whom one-third went to Acre. In Pará, the Lebanese settled in Belém, and in the cities of Cametá, Marabá, Altamira, Breves, Monte Alegre, Alenquer, Santarém, Óbidos, Soure, Maracanã, Abaetetuba, among others.

The first French immigrants arrived in Brazil in the second half of the 19th century, settling in the colony of Benevides, the metropolitan region of Belém do Pará. The French were attracted to the region because of the rubber boom, eventually settling in Belém, which became known as &quot;Paris N&#x27;América&quot;.

== Economy ==

The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 40.9%, followed by the industrial sector at 36.3%. Agriculture represents 22.8% of GDP (2004). Pará exports iron ore 31.1%, aluminium 22.2%, wood 13.5%, ores of aluminium 8.3%, others ores 7.9% (2002), representing 1.8% of the Brazilian economy (2005).

The mining sector represents 14% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the state, originated mainly from the extraction of iron, bauxite, manganese, limestone and tin, as well as gold, until recently extracted from one of the largest mines of recent history: Serra Pelada. The economy of Pará is based also on the extraction of vegetation, on agriculture and cattle raising. Thanks to the rich soil and the important hydrographic basin – boats are the main means of transport in the region. Guaraná, a tree from which a powder is produced and used as a stimulant, and annatto seeds, a fruit used for cooking, as a sunscreen and for dye extraction. Marajó – the biggest fluvial-maritime island in the world, with an area of . Its territory has one of the largest mining areas in the country, in the Carajás Mountains, a mining province where the Ferro Carajás Project is based, from Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. The complex produced 296 million metric tons of iron ore in 2007, exporting the product to many countries, among them Japan, Germany, Italy, France and Spain.

Pará is the largest producer of cassava, açaí, pineapple and cocoa of Brazil and is among the largest in Brazil in the production of black pepper (2nd place), coconut (3rd place) and banana (6th place).

In cassava production, Brazil produced a total of 17.6 million tons in 2018. Pará was the largest producer in the country, with 3.8 million tons.

In 2019, Pará produced 95% of açaí in Brazil. The state traded more than 1.2 million tons of the fruit, worth more than US$1.5 billion, about 3% of the state&#x27;s GDP.

In 2018, Pará was the largest Brazilian producer of pineapple, with 426 million fruits harvested on almost 19 thousand hectares. In 2017, Brazil was the 3rd largest producer in the world (close to 1.5 billion fruits harvested on approximately 60 thousand hectares). It is the fifth most cultivated fruit in the country. The southeast of Pará has 85% of the state production: the cities of Floresta do Araguaia (76.45%), Conceição do Araguaia (8.42%) and Salvaterra (3.12%) led the ranking this year. Floresta do Araguaia also has the largest concentrated fruit juice industry in Brazil, exporting to European Union, United States and Mercosur.

Pará is also one of the largest Brazilian producers of coconut. In 2019, it was the 3rd largest producer in the country, with 191.8 million fruits harvested, second only to Bahia and Ceará.

Pará is the 2nd largest Brazilian producer of black pepper, with 34 thousand tons harvested in 2018.

The Brazil nut has always been one of the main products of extraction in Northern Brazil, with collection on the forest floor. However, in recent decades, the commercial cultivation of Brazil nut was created. There are already properties with more than 1 million chestnut trees for large-scale production. The annual production averages in Brazil varied between 20 thousand and 40 thousand tons per year in 2016.

In the production of cocoa, Pará has been competing with Bahia for the leadership of Brazilian production. In 2017 Pará obtained the leadership for the first time. In 2019, people from Pará harvested 135 thousand tons of cocoa, and Bahians harvested 130 thousand tons. Bahia&#x27;s cocoa area is practically three times larger than that of Pará, but Pará&#x27;s productivity is practically three times greater. Some factors that explain this are: the crops in Bahia are more extractivist, and those in Pará have a more modern and commercial style, in addition to paraenses using more productive and resistant seeds, and their region providing resistance to Witch&#x27;s broom.

In 2018, Pará occupied the 6th national position in the banana production.

In 2018, Pará had the 5th largest cattle herd in Brazil, with 20.6 million head of cattle. The city of São Félix do Xingu is the largest in the country, with 2.2 million animals. Marabá is the 6th largest city in the country in numbers, with 1 million animals. In the ranking of the 20 main herds, Pará has seven names. Part of this is due to the fact that the municipalities of Pará have gigantic territory.

In 2017, in the iron ore sector, Pará was the 2nd largest national producer, with 169 million tons (of the 450 million produced by the country), at a value of R$25.5 billion. In copper, Pará produced almost 980 thousand tons (of the 1.28 million tons in Brazil), at a value of R$6.5 billion. In aluminum (bauxite), Pará carried out almost all Brazilian production (34.5 of 36.7 million tons) at a value of R$3 billion. In manganese, Pará produced a large part of Brazilian production (2.3 of 3.4 million tons) at a value of R$1 billion. In gold, Pará was the 3rd largest Brazilian producer, with 20 tons at a value of R$940 million. In nickel, Goiás and Pará are the only two producers in the country, with Pará being the 2nd in production, having obtained 90 thousand tons at a value of R$750 million. In tin, Pará the 3rd largest producer (4.4 thousand tons, at a value of R$114 million). Pará had 42.93% of the value of commercialized mineral production in Brazil, with almost R$38 billion.

Due to the proximity of the iron ore mines, Siderúrgica Norte Brasil (Sinobras) was created in Marabá. In 2018, the company produced 345 thousand tons of crude steel, of the 35.4 million produced in the country.

Pará had in 2017 an industrial GDP of R$43,8 billion, equivalent to 3.7% of the national industry. It employs 164,989 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Extraction of metallic minerals (46,9%), Industrial Public Utility Services, such as Electricity and Water (23.4%), Construction (14.8%), Metallurgy (4.3%) and Food (4.3%). These 5 sectors concentrate 93.7% of the state&#x27;s industry.

<text>Paraíba ( , ; ) is a state of Brazil. It is located in the Brazilian Northeast, and it is bordered by Rio Grande do Norte to the north, Ceará to the west, Pernambuco to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Paraíba is the third most densely populated state of the Northeast; João Pessoa, the sea-bordered state capital, and Campina Grande, in the interior, rank among the fifteen-largest municipalities in the Northeast of Brazil. The state is home to 1.9% of the Brazilian population and produces 0.9% of the Brazilian GDP and it is divided into 223 municipalities.

Paraíba is most populated along the Atlantic coast, which extends as far as Ponta do Seixas, the easternmost point of the Americas. The state is a tourist and industrial hotspot; it is known for its cultural heritage, amenable climate and geographical features, ranging from the seaside beaches to the Borborema Plateau. It is named after the Paraíba river.

Some of the most notable Brazilian writers and poets are from Paraíba like Augusto dos Anjos, José Américo de Almeida, José Lins do Rego, Ariano Suassuna and Pedro Américo, the last being also known for his historical paintings.

==History==
Before Europeans arrived in Brazil, the territory that is now the state of Paraíba was home to numerous indigenous tribes. Between the coast and the Borborema Plateau, the main indigenous group was the Potiguara (part of the larger Tupi group), who lived along the Paraíba do Norte river. The Kiriri and Ariús groups, meanwhile, lived further to the west, occupying the region between the Borborema Plateau and the sertão.

=== Colonization and conquest ===

In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral reached the northeastern coast of Brazil and claimed the territory of Brazil for the Portuguese Empire as set out in the Treaty of Tordesillas. It was not until 1534, however, that colonization began, spurred on by the increasing French presence in the Northeast. In that same year, the King of Portugal, John III, divided Brazil into fifteen captaincies. Most of what is now the state of Paraíba became part of the Captaincy of Itamaracá, which comprised a thin band of area stretching from the Tordesillas line at the far western extremity to the Ponta do Seixas, the easternmost point of Brazil. The remaining portions of the state fell under the neighboring captaincies of Rio Grande to the north and Pernambuco to the south. Itamaracá, in contrast to Pernambuco, continued to be troubled by French piracy, especially of wood, animal skins, and amber.

Convents, churches, and sugar mills began to sprout up in the captaincy as the colonial population grew. Where once the Portuguese had had a relatively conciliatory relationship with the Tupi people, due in part to their usefulness as allies against other European powers (the French, Dutch, and Spanish), as well as to other hostile indigenous peoples, the growth of the colonies sparked tensions. The principal reasons for heightened tensions were the encroachment of settlers on indigenous territory, driven by the establishment of sugarcane plantations and the increasing nutritional needs of a larger population; the new compulsory labor relations imposed by the Portuguese, which implied the abandonment of the indigenous agricultural production system, essential for the survival of the villages; and the fact that though they were banned from attacking Portuguese settlements, their own villages were subject to attacks from settlers searching for slave labor. Eventually, the tensions came to a head when the Potiguara people, urged on by the French, gathered around 2,000 tribesmen from Paraíba and Rio Grande and attacked the Tracunhaém plantation in 1574, killing all residents. The event had powerful reverberations in Lisbon, leading to King Henry creating the Royal Captaincy of Paraíba, which was subordinate directly to the Portuguese Crown. The &quot;Tragedy of Tracunhaém&quot; also served as the trigger for the Potiguara War, which lasted from 1574 to 1599.
Though it was officially created in 1574, the Captaincy of Paraíba was only made reality eleven years after the fact. In 1572, Luís de Brito was named the governor-general of the country and the governor of the northern captaincies, including Itamaracá. He received from the King the order to punish those responsible for the Tracunhaém attack and create a new city to serve as the governor&#x27;s seat. Brito&#x27;s expedition, as well as the next three attempts, ended in failure. Finally, in 1584, the new governor-general, Manuel Teles Barreto, mounted a successful expedition with the help of the captain-major of the captaincy, Frutuoso Barbosa, and the fleet of Admiral D. Diogo Flores de Valdés. At the time, eastern Paraíba was inhabited by the Potiguara people and their rivals, the Tabajaras, who had moved there from the central region following a period of drought. The Tabajara joined the Portuguese and together they chased the Potiguara from the area, thereby completing their original mission. Having now conquered Paraíba, the colonists established the first Royal City in Brazil under the Philippine Dynasty in 1585, named &quot;Filipeia de Nossa Senhora das Neves&quot; (today the capital of Paraíba, João Pessoa). Additionally, to repel French invaders, they constructed the &quot;Forte de São Tiago&quot; on the edge of the Paraíba do Norte river.

=== Dutch invasion ===

Owing to its lucrative sugarcane industry, the Captaincy of Paraíba proved to be one of the most economically successful regions in Portuguese America, alongside Pernambuco and Bahia. Because of this, the Dutch were interested in claiming the Northeast region and first attempted to do so in 1624 by seizing the then-capital city of Brazil, Salvador, in Bahia. Following their expulsion from Salvador, the Dutch made their first appearance on Paraíban territory on June 20, 1625, when they arrived in the Bay of Traição to treat their sick and bury their dead. The Dutch Admiral, Boudewijn Hendricksz, quickly formed an alliance with the Potiguaras, promising them protection in return for military support against the Portuguese. The governor of Paraíba, Antônio de Albuquerque, sent troops to drive away the invaders. Seven companies of men from the Captaincy of Paraíba, the Captaincy of Pernambuco, the Captaincy of Rio Grande, and from indigenous tribes succeeded in defeating the Dutch on August 1, at least for the time being. Hendricksz was able to escape, fleeing to Puerto Rico. During the battle, however, the Potiguaras suffered heavy losses of 600 to a thousand dead.

On December 5, 1632, 1,600 Dutchmen landed on Paraíban shores. After undergoing fire from the Portuguese, they began digging trenches in front of the Forte de Santa Catarina, located in Cabedelo, 18 km away from the center of Filipeia de Nossa Senhora das Neves (João Pessoa). Despite this stand, the Dutch once again proved unable to seize Paraíba and they were forced to retreat to Pernambuco, which they had already conquered in 1630.

The Dutch attempted the invasion anew on November 25, 1634, with the arrival of a squadron of 29 ships on the coast of Paraíba. Though reinforcements were sent to Paraíba from as far as Europe to repel the Dutch, the Portuguese had already been too weakened, and allowed the Forte de Santa Catarina and the Forte de Santo Antônio to fall into the hands of the Dutch. The Dutch then went to Filipeia de Nossa Senhora das Neves in search of Governor Antônio de Albuquerque, who was in command of the Portuguese troops. On Christmas Eve, they entered the city, but did not find Albuquerque; instead, they found empty streets and abandoned homes, a shell of the former city. With that final nail in the coffin — despite some ongoing resistance from the local population — the Dutch had finally conquered Paraíba. After the Dutch invasion, the sugarcane economy, the principal industry of the region, was devastated, as many sugarcane plantations on the coast had been set on fire. It was not until 1654, two decades later, that the Portuguese would finally retake Paraíba.

=== Expansion ===

Until 1670, colonial occupation of Paraíba had mostly been restricted to the east, near the coast, but from that point forward, colonists started pushing further into the interior. Much of these efforts were carried out by fortune-seeking explorers called bandeirantes, led by Domingos Jorge Velho. This expansion resulted in conflicts with the indigenous tribes of the region, including the enslavement and massacre of indigenous peoples.

Western expansion was also spearheaded by Catholic missionaries, who sought to convert the local indigenous population. One of the most important missionaries of this time was the priest Martim Nantes, who founded the village of Pilar.

On January 1, 1756, the Captaincy of Paraíba was dissolved and annexed to Pernambuco. This lasted until 1799, when it became the Captaincy of Paraíba again. At this time, some minor adjustments were made to Paraíba&#x27;s borders, with a portion of its northern territory being given to Rio Grande do Norte.

=== Revolt ===

Throughout its history, Paraíba participated in various revolts. The Pernambuco Revolution of 1817 stands out as an example; inspired by the War of Independence in the United States and the French Revolution, its objective was to make Brazil an independent country. From its origins in Pernambuco, the revolution spread to the entire Northeast. In Paraíba, the movement arose in the southern municipality of Itabaiana and fanned out to the agreste, sertão, and coast. The movement proved unsuccessful, though the struggle for independence continued on afterwards. The following five years (1818–1822) were marked by clashes between two rival factions: the cajás, also called patriots, who were revolutionaries, and the carambolas (realists), who were counterrevolutionaries.

In 1822, Brazil finally became an independent country and Paraíba was turned into a province of the Brazilian Empire of King Pedro I. Two years later, Paraíba was implicated in the Confederation of the Equator, which was an anti-authoritarian movement that started in Pernambuco. The movement was suppressed by Imperial forces, with some of the leaders sentenced to execution.

Inspired by the various revolutions that took place in Europe in 1848, the Praieira Revolt was organized in Pernambuco at the end of that same year. It arrived in Paraíba in February 1849, led by Maximiano Machado and Borges da Fonseca, demanding various social and economic reforms, such as land ownership changes, democracy, and freedom of the press. The revolt only lasted for about five months and ended in failure. Three years later, in 1851, Paraíba and its neighboring provinces became involved in the Ronco da Abelha revolt. This revolt was a reaction to new modernization laws from the Imperial government that, it was falsely rumored, would enslave the lower-classes of workers in Paraíba now that the slave trade was prohibited in Brazil. Between the months of October and December 1874, Paraíba participated in the Quebra–Quilos revolt, which was instigated by the replacement of the measurement system in Brazil with the metric system. The uprising was mostly concentrated in rural areas and was characterized by several acts of violence, at the same time as the so-called Religious Issue was gaining momentum. Paraíba also participated in the Paraguayan War, with a force of three thousand men.

In 1860, Paraíba had a population of about 212,000 people and suffered from several serious public health problems, including epidemics like cholera and yellow fever. One of the main causes of these issues was the lack of water in the largely semi-arid climate of the province. In 1877, Paraíba was hit by the worst drought in its history, accentuating poverty and prompting migration from the interior to the east.

=== Building a republic ===

In November 1889, after the fall of the monarchical regime in Brazil and the institution of a republic, Paraíba became a federal state. Venâncio Neiva became the first president — equivalent to the modern-day role of governor — of the state. Neiva served from 1889 to 1891, when he was deposed. The next president was a member of the Social Nationaist Party (PSN), Floriano Peixoto. The PSN governed Paraíba until 1908, when the Conservative Republican Party (PRC) won the elections. The PRC then remained in power for an additional two decades, until the end of the Old Republic in 1930.

After the onset of the First World War (1914–1918), the economy of Paraíba entered a crisis, mainly due to the drop in exports of one of the main agricultural products of the state, cotton. In the April 1919 federal election, the Paraíban candidate Epitácio Pessoa won; at the time, he was leading the Brazilian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. After returning to Brazil, he was sworn in as president on July 28, 1919, and remained in office until November 15, 1922. It was during his government that Brazil celebrated its first centennial of independence.

Dissatisfied with the current oligarchical system, in February 1926 a rebel group called the Coluna Prestes entered Paraíba. The group faced resistance from the local population as they traveled through cities in the hinterland, including in Piancó where a local political leader, Father Aristides Ferreira da Cruz, died during the clashes, becoming one of the Martyrs of Piancó. The sertão was also home to other groups operating outside the law, namely the cangaço bandits (cangaceiros), the most well-known of which is Virgulino Ferreira da Silva (Lampião).

In 1928, João Pessoa (the nephew of Epitácio Pessoa, the former president of Brazil) was elected as governor of Paraíba. Under his administration, cangaceiros in the interior of the state were persecuted and oligarchs were defied, generating discontent among the local landlords. This was especially the case with José Pereira Lima, a political leader of the municipality of Princesa Isabel and an ally of presidential candidate Júlio Prestes. With the invasion of the city of Teixeira by the Paraíban police and the imminent invasion of Lima&#x27;s own Princesa Isabel, on February 28, 1930, he proclaimed the independent &quot;Território de Princesa&quot;, which would only be subordinate directly to the federal government. The next day, the national election took place, with João Pessoa as the vice-presidential candidate for Getúlio Vargas. Though they had the support of the Liberal Alliance (), created by Paraíba together with Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul in the last year, they were defeated by Júlio Prestes and Vital Soares.

On July 26, 1930, João Pessoa was assassinated by João Duarte Dantas. Generating great national commotion, especially among the states of the Liberal Alliance, the death of João Pessoa was one of the triggers of the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 that brought Vargas to power. It also resulted in the weakening of the armed movement in Território de Princesa, which became a part of Paraíba again on August 11, 1930, four days after João Pessoa was buried in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The state capital was then renamed to João Pessoa and, three weeks later, the current flag of Paraíba was adopted, representing Pessoa&#x27;s stand against the presidency of Júlio Prestes. Between the 1930 revolution and Vargas&#x27; fall from power in 1946, the state of Paraíba was governed by ten federal appointees, the first being Antenor de França Navarro (1930–1932) and the last being José Gomes da Silva (1946–1947). Only in January 1947 did Paraíba start holding direct elections for the governorship again, with the first governor under the new president being Osvaldo Trigueiro (1947–1951).

In 1964, a coup d&#x27;état by military forces deposed President João Goulart from power and instituted a military dictatorship. Pedro Gondim, the governor of Paraíba, had been allied with Goulart, resulting in his mandate being revoked and his political rights being suspended for ten years by the new administration. Among the local Paraíban population, opponents to the coup were arrested, exiled, tortured, or killed, with an amnesty only being granted in the late 1970s. The next few governors were all indirectly elected, either by the legislative assembly or the electoral college, until 1983 when Wilson Braga was democratically elected governor. With the constitution of 1988, Brazil returned to a democratic system of government.

In 1997, the body of former president João Pessoa was transferred from Rio de Janeiro to the eponymous capital of Paraíba, where he was buried in a mausoleum built by the state government.

=== Twenty-first century ===

In 2009, Governor Cássio Cunha Lima was impeached after being elected two terms in a row. As such, the runner-up of the previous elections, José Maranhão, who had already been governor from 1995 to 2002, was reappointed as governor of Paraíba. Despite the confirmation of Lima&#x27;s impeachment by the Superior Electoral Court (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral), he ran again in 2014, though he lost to the former mayor of João Pessoa, Ricardo Coutinho, first elected in 2011.

Between 2012 and 2017, Paraíba faced the worst drought in its recent history, which put more than 90% of Paraíba municipalities in a state of emergency and had significant ramifications for agriculture, electricity generation, and water supply. In 2017, after years in the works, the east axis of the multi-billion dollar São Francisco river transfer project was completed, allowing for water to be diverted to the Paraíba do Norte river. The goal of the project — the largest water infrastructure project in Brazil&#x27;s history — is to alleviate the impact of droughts and water shortages in the semi-arid regions of the Northeast.

==Geography==

Paraíba, located in the eastern portion of the broader Northeast region, is one of 27 states of Brazil. Its total area is 56,467.242 km2, making it the seventh smallest state in the country and the fourth smallest in the Northeast. The distance between its north and south extremities is 263 kilometers, and that of its east and west extremities is 443 kilometers. On average, the state sits at a relatively low elevation, with its highest elevations found in the Borborema Plateau in the center of the state. The highest peak in Paraíba and the third highest peak in the Northeast, Pico do Jabre, is located in this plateau at 1,208 meters above sea level.

There are 11 river basins in Paraíba, the largest of which is the Piancó-Piranhas-Açu river basin, which feeds six sub-basins and covers an area of approximately 26,047.49 km2, followed by the Paraíba river basin, which feeds four sub-basins and covers an area of approximately 20,071.83 km2.

===Climate===

The majority of Paraíba is considered to have a hot semi-arid climate, with almost 98% of its territory included in the so-called &quot;Polygon of Drought.&quot; Parts of the state that do not fall into this category, namely the far east and far west, have a tropical climate.

Paraíba goes through wet and dry seasons, with most of its rain falling in the first third of the year, especially in March and April. However, in the east, including the coast and the agreste mesoregion, most rainfall occurs from April to June.

In the entire state, the period from October to December is the hottest and driest of the year, whereas June to August is the coldest, with temperatures in some areas reaching below 20 °C. Areia, located in the agreste, is the coldest city of the state while Patos, located in the sertão, is the hottest. A record low temperature of 7.7 °C was recorded in the city of Monteiro on July 28, 1976.
===Geology===

In 1987, a team led by gemstone prospector Heitor Dimas Barbosa uncovered tourmaline crystals in the Batalha mine, about 50 km away from Patos. A trace of copper gives the tourmalines a vivid turquoise color that is sometimes referred to as &quot;neon&quot;.

The neon Paraíba tourmaline has also been found in the neighboring state of Rio Grande do Norte. In the early 2000s, tourmaline gems containing copper and bearing similar colors were found in Nigeria and Mozambique.

Initially, the nomenclature for this tourmaline was &quot;Paraíba tourmaline&quot;. In 2006, the LMHC (Laboratory Manual Harmonization Committee) agreed that &quot;Paraíba&quot; should be simplified to &quot;paraiba&quot; and should refer to a variety of tourmaline instead of indicating a geographic origin. The term &quot;paraiba tourmaline&quot; may now refer to gems found in Brazil, Nigeria, and Mozambique that contain copper and have the characteristic fluorescent blue-green color.

The stone has since become among the most sought-after gemstones on the market, yielding upwards of $50,000+ per carat. These tourmalines are often subject to heat-treatment and clarity enhancement to achieve a more desirable color. A lack of these treatments often increases the value of the stone.

== Demographics ==

According to the 2022 census, there were 3,974,687 people residing in the state, with a population density of 70.4 inhabitants/km2.
Other numbers include: Urbanization rate: 75.4% (2010), Population growth: 0.8% (1991–2000) and Houses: 987,000 (2006).

The 2022 census also revealed the following figures relating ethnicity: 2,207,880 Brown (Multiracial) people (55.5%), 1,419,778 White people (35.7%), 316,572 Black people (8.0%), 25,478 Amerindian people (0.6%) and 4,912 Asian (0.1%) people.

Among people of mixed ancestry the White, Amerindian and African altogether combination is the most prevalent one, followed by caboclo, mulato and zambo.

===Education===

Portuguese is the official and only language spoken in the state and thus the primary language taught in schools. However, significant dialectal differences regarding other Brazilian varieties are present, although mainly phonological (&quot;Northeastern accent&quot;).

English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.

====Educational institutions====

==Economy==

The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 56.5%, followed by the industrial sector at 33.1%. Agriculture represents 10.4%, of GDP (2004). Paraíba exports: woven of cotton 36.3%, footweares 20.1%, sugar and alcohol 10.8%, fish and crustacean 9.7%, sisal 7%, cotton 6.6% (2002).

Share of the Brazilian economy: 0.8% (2004).

The Paraíba economy is largely based upon the making of shoes and other leather products, the raising of cattle for beef, and sugarcane, corn. Though historically sugarcane has dominated the Paraíba agricultural sector, pineapple, corn, and beans cultivation are also widespread. The other important economical sector in the state is tourism, especially the state urban and unspoilt beaches, ecotourism and festivals such as &quot;carnaval&quot; and &quot;São João.&quot;

==Infrastructure==

===International Airport===
Located in the municipality of Bayeux, from downtown João Pessoa, Presidente Castro Pinto International Airport is currently undergoing expansion and remodeling work, which will raise the terminal&#x27;s annual capacity to 860 thousand passengers.
The airport is well located in relation to obstacles because it covers an area roughly above sea level and is sufficiently distant from urban areas or large real estate developments.

The surrounding area is sparsely populated, with large open spaces. The existing developments are industrial with some small weekend country houses. There is no rough terrain or tall buildings nearby creating obstacles for takeoffs and landings.
The airport also is blessed with excellent climatic conditions for air operations. Moreover, within its approach radius there are no obstacles that can hinder or create risk for local air traffic. Named for a past president (former name for governors) of Paraíba, Castro Pinto, the airport operates round the clock.

The current passenger terminal, built in an area of , has two levels, gardens and ample vehicle parking. It has all the expected amenities: arrival and departure lounges, a main concourse, check-in counters, baggage storage lockers, airline counters, snack bar/restaurant, tourist information booth, car rental agencies, taxi service and private parking.

===Highways===

The BR-101 also the BR-230 are found in Paraíba . Several other roads also cross the state composing the complex net which is present all across the country.

===National Airport===
Located in the interior of the state of Paraíba, in the city of Campina Grande, João Suassuna Airport was remodeled in 2003, receiving a new terminal with capacity of 250 thousand passengers a year.

The old building was demolished and on the site a new facility was built holding nine shops, the main concourse, arrival and departure lounges, VIP lounge, bathrooms, mezzanine and a diaper-changing area.

The terminal area was increased to . The boarding area has and the parking lot has spaces for 180 cars.

This expansion benefited the city both economically and from the standpoint of tourism. With the possibility for new flights, the air cargo movement will be able to grow, along with the number of tourists coming to attend the city&#x27;s São João Festival.
A panel measuring in the front of the building carries a poem by the Paraíban writer Ariano Suassuna, in homage to his father, for whom the airport is named. Three more artworks are on permanent display in the passenger terminal.

==Culture==

===Festa Junina (Saint John Festival)===

Festa Junina was introduced to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese for whom St John&#x27;s day (also celebrated as Midsummer Day in several European countries), on the 24th of June, is one of the oldest celebrations of the year. Differently, of course, from what happens on the European Midsummer Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the summer solstice but during the winter solstice. The festivities traditionally begin after the 12th of June, on the eve of St Anthony&#x27;s day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter&#x27;s day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Once exclusively a rural festival, today in Brazil, it is largely a city festival during which people joyfully and theatrically mimic peasant stereotypes and clichés in a spirit of jokes and good times. Typical refreshments and dishes are served. Like during Carnival, these festivities involve costume-wearing (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing), such as what happens on Midsummer and St John&#x27;s Day in Europe, and bonfires are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.

===Carnival===
The four-day period before Lent leading up to Ash Wednesday is carnival time in Brazil. Rich and poor alike forget their cares as they party in the streets.

The word &quot;nego&quot; on the state flag is Portuguese for &quot;I deny&quot; or &quot;I refuse&quot;, referring to the events that led to the Brazilian Revolution of 1930.

Due to Milk Coffee Politics in Brazil, the president of the country always alternated between someone from the state of Minas Gerais and someone from the state of São Paulo. In 1929, the incumbent president from São Paulo, Washington Luís, was supposed to support a politician from Minas Gerais as the next president, but he instead decided to nominate someone from São Paulo for the second time in a row, Júlio Prestes. The state governor of Paraíba, João Pessoa Cavalcânti de Albuquerque, refused to support the appointment of Júlio Prestes, and in 1930, Pessoa joined the alliance for the overthrow of the federal government. The revolution succeeded in toppling the Old Republic and installing Getúlio Vargas—who was from neither Minas Gerais nor São Paulo—as the president of Brazil, however, João Pessoa was assassinated; there is still debate as to whether the motive behind his murder was personal, political, or both. Following these events, the word &quot;nego&quot; was added to the flag of Paraíba.

According to the official government site of the state of Paraíba, the red color stands for the blood of João Pessoa after his assassination, while the black color represents mourning.

In football, the main teams in the state are: Botafogo from João Pessoa, Campinense and Treze, both from Campina Grande.

<doc id="229525" wikidata="Q40942" url="?curid=229525" title="Pernambuco">
<text>Pernambuco () is a state of Brazil located in the Northeast region of the country. With an estimated population of 9.5 million people as of 2024, it is the seventh-most populous state of Brazil and with around 98,067.877 km2, it is the 19th-largest in area among federative units of the country. It is also the sixth-most densely populated with around 92.37 people per km2. Its capital and largest city, Recife, is one of the most important economic and urban hubs in the country. Based on 2019 estimates, the Recife Metropolitan Region is seventh-most populous in the country, and the second-largest in northeastern Brazil. In 2015, the state had 4.4% of the national population and produced 2.8% of the national gross domestic product (GDP).

The contemporary state inherits its name from the Captaincy of Pernambuco, established in 1534. The region was originally inhabited by Tupi–Guarani-speaking peoples. European colonization began in the 16th century, under mostly Portuguese rule interrupted by a brief period of Dutch rule, followed by Brazilian independence in 1822. Large numbers of slaves were brought from Africa during the colonial era to cultivate sugarcane, and a significant portion of the state&#x27;s population has some amount of African ancestry.

The state has rich cultural traditions thanks to its varied history and peoples. Brazilian Carnivals in Recife and the historic colonial capital of Olinda are renowned: the Galo da Madrugada parade in Recife has held world records for its size.

Historically a center of sugarcane cultivation due to the favorable climate, the state has a modern economy dominated by the services sector today, though large amounts of sugarcane are still grown. The coming of democracy in 1985 has brought the state progress and challenges in turn: while economic and health indicators have improved, inequality remains high.

== Etymology ==
The origins of the name &quot;Pernambuco&quot; are debated, though most hypotheses derive the name from the now-extinct Tupi language.

Some scholars claim that the name comes from the combining of the Tupi words &quot;para&#x27;nã&quot;, meaning &quot;great river&quot; or &quot;sea&quot; and &quot;buka&quot;, meaning &quot;hole&quot;. Thus, &quot;pernambuco&quot; would mean &quot;hole in the sea&quot;, possibly referring to the Canal de Santa Cruz on the Island of Itamaracá, north of Olinda, or to an opening in the reefs between Olinda and Recife. According to others, &quot;pernambuco&quot; was the name of brazilwood in local indigenous languages at the time of first contact, as the tree is found widely in the forests of the future state. A third hypothesis also derives from a Tupi word, &quot;paranãbuku&quot;, meaning &quot;long river&quot;, a possible reference to the Capibaribe River, since primitive maps mark such a &quot;Pernambuco river&quot; north of Cabo de Santo Agostinho, south of Recife.

Another hypothesis, suggested by the academic Jacques Ribemboim, asserts the origins of the name from the Portuguese language. The Canal de Santa Cruz in Recife, at the beginning of the 16th century, was known as &quot;Boca de Fernão&quot; (named after the explorer Fernão de Noronha). The Indians may have pronounced &quot;Fernão&quot; as &quot;Pernao&quot; and reversed the order of the words, giving &quot;Pernão Boca&quot; or &quot;Pernambuka&quot;, leading to the contemporary name of Pernambuco.

The state also has some nicknames, such as &quot;Lion of the North&quot;, &quot;Land of Frevo and Maracatu&quot; and &quot;Blessed Land&quot;.

== Geography ==
Pernambuco comprises a comparatively narrow coastal zone, a high inland plateau, and an intermediate zone formed by the terraces and slopes between the two.

Its surface is much broken by the remains of the ancient plateau which has been worn down by erosion, leaving escarpments and ranges of flat-topped mountains, called chapadas, capped in places by horizontal layers of sandstone. Ranges of these chapadas form the boundary lines with three states–the Serra dos Irmãos and Serra Vermelha with Piauí, the Serra do Araripe with Ceará, and the Serra dos Cariris Velhos with Paraíba.


=== Regions ===
The coastal area is fertile, and was formerly covered by the humid Pernambuco coastal forests, the northern extension of the Atlantic Forests (Mata Atlântica) of eastern Brazil. It is now occupied by extensive sugar cane plantations. It has a hot, humid climate, relieved to some extent by the south-east trade winds.

The middle zone, called the &quot;agreste&quot; region, has a drier climate and lighter vegetation, including the semi-deciduous Pernambuco interior forests, where many trees lose their leaves in the dry season.

The inland region, called the &quot;sertão&quot; is high, stony, and dry, and frequently devastated by prolonged droughts (secas). The climate is characterized by hot days and cool nights. There are two clearly defined seasons, a rainy season from March to June, and a dry season for the remaining months. The interior of the state is covered mostly by the dry thorny scrub vegetation called &quot;caatinga&quot;. The Rio São Francisco is the main water source for this area.

The climate is more mild in the Borborema Plateau (&quot;Planalto da Borborema&quot;). Some towns are located more than 1000 meters above sea level, and temperatures there can descend to 10 °C (50 °F) and even 5 °C (41 °F) in some cities (i.e., Triunfo) during the winter.

The volcanic archipelago of Fernando de Noronha in the Atlantic Ocean, 535 km northeast of Recife, has been part of Pernambuco since 1988.

=== Hydrology ===
The rivers of the state include a number of small plateau streams flowing southward to the São Francisco River, and several large streams in the eastern part flowing eastward to the Atlantic. The former are the Moxotó, Ema, Pajeú, Terra Nova, Brigida, Boa Vista and Pontai, and are dry channels the greater part of the year.

The largest of the coastal rivers are the Goiana River, which is formed by the confluence of the Tracunhaem and Capibaribe-mirim, and drains a rich agricultural region in the north-east part of the state; the Capibaribe, which has its source in the Serra de Jacarara and flows eastward to the Atlantic at Recife with a course of nearly ; the Ipojuca, which rises in the Serra de Aldeia Velha and reaches the coast south of Recife; the Serinhaen; and the Uná. A large tributary of the Uná, the Rio Jacuhipe, forms part of the boundary line with Alagoas.

== History ==

===Prehistory===
Prior to discovery and colonization by Portugal, Pernambuco was inhabited by numerous tribes of Tupi-Guarani speaking indigenous peoples. The Tupi peoples were a largely hunter-gatherer culture living in long houses who cultivated some indigenous crops, most notably manioc (&quot;Manihot esculenta&quot;), but lacked any metallic tools. Many elements of the Tupi culture were a shock to Europeans: among these, they bathed frequently, they eschewed wealth accumulation, practiced nudity, and warred frequently, primarily to capture enemies for communal, ritual cannibalism.

===European contact===

Modern day Pernambuco includes the islands of Fernando de Noronha, which precedes mainland Pernambuco&#x27;s history since the islands were granted to Fernão de Laronha by King Manoel in 1502.

Pernambuco was initially valued as a source of Brazilwood (&quot;Caesalpinia echinata&quot;) used in Europe for dyes. These Amerindians were eager to harvest and exchange brazilwood for axes, fishhooks and other goods offered by Europeans. The Portuguese crown granted a license to Fernão de Laronha in 1502. After the expiration of the license the trade in brazilwood was a driver of the exploration of Brazil. Brazilwood was highly valued and other European nations, particularly the French, soon sent ships to exploit this new dye wood. The French under Bertrand d&#x27;Ornesan tried to establish a French trading post at Pernambuco in 1531. This fort was located at the border of Pernambuco and Itamaricá to the North. The Portuguese King responded by dispatching an armada under the command of Pero Lopes de Sousa. Pero Lopes defeated the French, destroyed their fort and built a new fort.

===Portuguese settlement===
Shortly after the success in dislodging the French from Pernambuco&#x27;s northern border with Itamaricá the Portuguese began to settle Brazil. King John III of Portugal created the Hereditary Captaincies in 1534, Pernambuco was granted to Duarte Coelho, who arrived in &quot;Nova Lusitânia&quot; (or &quot;New Lusitania&quot;) in 1535. Duarte directed military actions against the French-allied Caetés Indians and upon their defeat in 1537 established a settlement at the site of a former Marin Indian village, henceforth known as Olinda, as well as another village at Igarassu. Under his leadership sugar soon replaced Brazilwood as Pernambuco&#x27;s most profitable export. Due to the cultivation of sugar and cotton, Pernambuco was one of the few prosperous captaincies (the other notable one being São Vicente).

====Slavery====

In addition to requiring a lot of capital investment, refining sugar in the 16th century also required a vast amount of labor. Brazilian Indians were very useful to the Portuguese; both free Indians and enslaved Indians performed many useful services for the Portuguese settlers. This included helping with building Engenhos. However, Brazilian Indian culture was not well suited to the operation of sugar engenhos. Indian culture was not oriented to wealth accumulation. Stuart Schwartz expressed it, &quot;Once a man had enough to eat and a few new tools and weapons, why should he want or work for more.&quot;

While the sugar industry relied at first on the labor of indigenous peoples, especially the Tupis and Tapuyas, high mortality and economic growth led to the importation of enslaved Africans from the late 17th century onward. Some of these slaves escaped the sugar-producing coastal regions and formed independent inland communities called mocambos, including Palmares.

===Dutch conquest===


In 1630, Pernambuco, as well as many Portuguese possessions in Brazil, was occupied by the Dutch until 1654. The occupation was strongly resisted and the Dutch conquest was only partially successful for these few decades. In the interim, thousands of the enslaved Africans had fled to Palmares, and soon the mocambos there had grown into two significant states. The Dutch Republic, which allowed sugar production to remain in Portuguese hands, regarded suppression of Palmares as important, but was unsuccessful in this. Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, count of Nassau, was appointed as ruler of the &quot;Nieuw Holland&quot; (Dutch colonization enterprise in Brazil).

In the 17th century, the Netherlands was experiencing a surge of freedom and progress, and wanted to expand their colonies in the American continent. An expression of this new economy was the Dutch West India Company, (modeled after the Dutch East India company which had influence throughout the world and controlled much of the trade between East and West). A Board of nineteen members appointed Prince Johan Maurits, Count of Nassau, Governor of Pernambuco. It was an auspicious choice for Northeast, because he was a lover of the arts with a deep interest in the New World. In 1637 he opened his government guidelines quite different from those of the Portuguese colonists, declaring &quot;Freedom of Religion and Trade&quot;. His entourage contained traders, artists, planners, German and Dutch citizens. He was accompanied by six painters, including Frans Post and Albert Eckhout. Nassau also created an environment of Dutch religious tolerance, new to Portuguese America and irritating to his Calvinist associates. Nassau made efforts to reduce the sugar production monoculture by encouraging the cultivation of other crops, particularly foodstuffs.
===Jewish immigration===

Under Dutch rule, Jewish culture developed in Recife. Many Jews, having fled the Inquisition in Iberia, sought refuge in the Netherlands. The Jewish community established themselves in Dutch Brazil and would later migrate elsewhere in the Americas. There are records that in 1636 a synagogue was being built in the city. A Jewish scholar from Amsterdam, Isaac Aboab da Fonseca, arrived in Recife in 1642, becoming the first rabbi on Brazilian soil and on the continent. In 1643, three years after the Portuguese regained the crown in the metropolis, Father António Vieira – frowned upon, persecuted by the Inquisition and admirer of Aboab – recommended the King of Portugal occupy the capital of the New Christian and Jewish immigrants to help the depressed Portuguese finances

===Portuguese reconquest===
The Portuguese reconquered Recife in 1654 and Olinda regained its status of political center. However, Recife remained the commercial /port city. Nowadays, it is credited that many inhabitants of Pernambuco&#x27;s &quot;agreste&quot; region have some Dutch ancestry.
If the Dutch were gone, however, the threat of the now unified quilombo of Palmares remained. In spite of a treaty negotiated in 1678 with its ruler Ganga Zumba, a war between the two remained. Zumbi who became ruler following the peace treaty and later repudiated it, fought the Portuguese government until 1694 when soldiers brought from the south eventually defeated him.

===Three centuries of the sugar cycle===
Throughout the remainder of the 17th century on to the 20th century much of life in Pernambuco was dominated by the patterns established by monoculture, latifundia, and slavery (until 1888). Sugar and cotton were grown on large plantations and rural society was largely divided into landowning elites and the impoverished poor. In addition, Pernambuco, except for a narrow coastland, is subject to periodic droughts. The boom and bust economy throughout this period is often exemplified as the &quot;sugar cycle&quot; when the international market for sugar is good, the economy booms, when the market is bad, it is hard times for all and particularly for the impoverished. Sugar has always been the principal example of the boom or bust cycle, but there has, from time to time been a similar cycle in cotton. Cotton was profitable during the U.S. War of Independence, the War of 1812, and the U.S. Civil War. Each time the bust in Pernambuco came when U.S. growers resumed their exports.

====17th-century class conflict====
A sugar mill &quot;engenho&quot; requires a large investment both to build and to operate. Much of the time the money is borrowed. Although there were other sources, one source that was a particular irritant to mill owners were the merchants of Recife. In 1710 this irritant resulted in the Mascate War. This conflict set the &quot;mascates&quot; from Recife against the establishment planters of Olinda It was led by the &quot;Senhores de Engenho&quot; (owners of the sugar mills). It is an example of the continuing tensions between the senhores de engenho (the landed elites) in colonial Brazil and the merchants of Recife. The &quot;War&quot; (there was considerable shooting but little loss of life) has elements of class struggle. Olinda had, before the Dutch, always been the municipal seat. Recife, once merely a port facility for Olinda, had formerly consisted of a few modest dwellings, warehouses, and businesses catering to ships and seamen, but under the Dutch had been developed into a thriving center of commerce populated by wealthy, more recently arrived merchants to whom most of the landed aristocracy of Pernambuco were heavily indebted. After several excesses the king issued a new set of instructions to the governor. In 1715 the crown dispatched a new governor and the residents of Pernambuco finally felt the troubles were ended, though many families of the colony&#x27;s elites were ruined.

====18th century: mining eclipses sugar====
The discovery of gold in Minas Gerais late in the Seventeenth Century and the discovery of diamond displaced agriculture. In fact, for all the disruption caused by &quot;gold fever&quot; throughout the mining boom the value of sugar exports always exceeded the value of any other export. Nevertheless, among many other disruptions, gold shifted the focus South. Pernambuco, Bahia, and the entire Northeast were eclipsed by the South of Brazil and that shift in focus has never been reversed.

====19th century: a province, then a state====
Pernambuco&#x27;s response to the nationhood of Brazil seems to have been rebellion. Pernambuco was the site of some of the most important rebellions and insurrections in Brazilian history, especially in the 19th century. See Also Rebellions and revolutions in Brazil, Pernambucan Revolt, Cabanada, April Revolt (Pernambuco) At one point Pernambuco led much of the Northeast region in a very short-lived independent Confederation of the Equator.

====The end of slavery and the beginning of the republic====
In 1888, under the influence of increasingly urban society, and with the advocacy of intellectuals such as Pernambucan politician Joaquim Nabuco, slavery was abolished. However, freedom for the slaves did little or nothing to improve life for the underclass. Economic downturns were used to cut wages, children were paid almost nothing, and violence ruled. In those days before antibiotics there were major epidemics, fourteen between 1849 and 1920.

====20th century====

The twentieth century did bring better communication and transportation which would slowly allow development. But for the poor employed in the sugar industry, as late as the 1960s infant mortality in this labor segment was nearly half of live births. Politically, the century was dominated by two periods of dictatorship, ruled by Getúlio Vargas for most of the period from 1930 to 1954. and the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985

===Post-dictatorship progress===
Since the end of military rule, there is still an underemployed and under-fed underclass. However, quality of life has improved along with industrial development. Pernambuco has also become a major tourist destination. Statistics from the turn of the millennium show a sharp and continuing improvement. According to estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study, the infant mortality rate declined 6.2 percent annually between 1990 and 2015: from 90.4 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 1990, to 13.4 deaths/1000 live births in 2015. The homicide rate in Recife, still higher than the average for Brazil, declined by about 6% per annum during the period from 2000 to 2012.

Income inequality remains a problem; in 2000, the state had a Gini coefficient of 0.59, with wealth and resources being concentrated at the top.

== Government and politics ==
The state government is divided into three branches, like all Brazilian states. All the branches are located in capital of Recife.

* Executive: the Governor, currently Raquel Lyra of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, is responsible for administration. The vice-governor, currently Priscila Krause of the Cidadania is first in line of succession to the governorship, but otherwise has few responsibilities.
* Legislative: the Legislative Assembly of Pernambuco, a unicameral body with 49 state deputies. It meets in the &quot;Edifício Governador Miguel Arraes de Alencar.&quot;
* Judicial: the (&quot;Tribunal de Justiça de Pernambuco&quot;), with 52 justices.

The governor and deputies are elected to four year terms in Brazilian general elections, with the most recent being held in 2022.

=== Local government ===
The 185 municipalities that make up the state have similar structures, though they lack the judicial branch. Each municipality has a chief executive, analogous to mayor, called a &quot;Prefeito/Prefeita&quot;, while the legislative branch is called the &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;.

Municipal officials also serve four year terms, with the most recent being held in 2020.

Fernando de Noronha is a &quot;sui generis&quot; &quot;State District&quot; (&quot;distrito estadual&quot;), governed directly by a Pernambuco state administrator.

=== Federal representation ===
At the federal level, Pernambuco is represented by 25 deputies in the Chamber of Deputies, and three senators in the Federal Senate.

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===
According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), at the last census in 2022 there were 9,058,621 people residing in the state. The population is concentrated along the coast in the Recife Metropolitan Region.

Urbanization: 77% (2006); Population growth: 1.2% (1991–2000); Houses: 2,348,000 (2006).

=== Religion ===

The majority of the state&#x27;s inhabitants are Catholic; while more than 86% of the state is Christian.

In 2010, 5,834,601 inhabitants identified as Roman Catholic (65.95%), 1,788,973 as Evangelical (20.34%): of these, 1,102,485 were Pentecostal (12.53%), and 376,880 were Evangelical Protestant (4.28%) and 309,608 other Evangelical (3.52%). 123,798 inhabitants identified as spiritists (1.41%), 43,726 as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (0.50%), 26,526 as Brazilian Apostolic Catholics (0.30%) and 6,678 as Eastern Orthodox(0.08%).

914,954 had no religion (10.40%): of these, 10,284 identified as atheists (0.12%) and 5,638 as agnostics (0.06%). 80,591 followed all other religions not listed above (0.90%), and 9,805 did not know or did not declare (0.12%).

The former Latin Catholic Territorial Prelature of Pernambuco became the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Olinda &amp; Recife, with these suffragan dioceses in its ecclesiastical province (all in Pernambuco) : Diocese of Afogados da Ingazeira, Diocese of Caruaru, Diocese of Floresta, Diocese of Garanhuns, Diocese of Nazaré, Diocese of Palmares, Diocese of Pesqueira, Diocese of Petrolina and Diocese of Salgueiro.

=== Racial/Ethnic composition ===
The results of the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) conducted in 2022 led to the following estimates of race or skin color: 5,006,802 Brown (Multiracial) people (55.3%), 3,043,916 White people (33.6%), 909,557 Black people (10.0%), 83,667 Indigenous people (0.9%) and 13,225 Asian people (0.1%).

Due to the legacy of slavery and the sugarcane plantations, it has been observed that those of mixed African and Portuguese ancestry are more common on the coast, while Mamelucos (those of mixed Amerindian and Portuguese ancestry) are more common in the interior &quot;Sertão&quot; region.

According to a genetic study from 2013, Pernambucans have 56.8% European, 27.9% African and 15.3% Amerindian ancestries.

=== Largest cities ===
===Education===
Portuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. But English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.

====Higher education====
Pernambuco is served by many higher education institutions, concentrated in Recife. Most universities and colleges were founded in the 19th and 20th century, and some are known nationally.

The oldest is the Faculdade de Direito do Recife (), founded on 11 August 1827 in the then-state capital of Olinda, one of the first higher education institutes in Brazil. Castro Alves and Joaquim Nabuco, two important Brazilian historical figures are among its alumni.

Many institutions are composed of several autonomous campuses serving the entire state, however Recife remains undeniably the center of education.

Important institutions include:

Headquartered in Recife:
* The Federal University of Pernambuco (&quot;Universidade Federal de Pernambuco&quot;, UFPE), which now contains the historical College of Law of Recife, public, federally-funded
* The Catholic University of Pernambuco, (Universidade Católica de Pernambuco, Unicap), private, non-profit,

==Economy==
The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 73.2%, followed by the industrial sector at 21.6%. Agribusiness represents 5.2% of GDP (2006). Pernambuco exports: sugar 35.6%, fruit and juice 12.6%, fish and crustacean 12.3%, electric products 11.1%, chemicals 7.1%, woven 5.6% (2002).

According with IBGE, in 2007 &quot;Pernambuco&quot; has 2.34% share of the Brazilian economy and 17.9% share of the Northeast region economy. It&#x27;s the 10th largest economy of the whole country. The GDP for the state was R$104,394,000,000 (2011), and the per capita income was R$11,776.
The economy is based on agriculture (sugarcane, manioc), livestock farming and creations, as well as industry (shipbuilding, automotive, chemical, metallurgical, electronic, textile, alimentary). In the period of October 2005 to October 2006, the industrial growth of the state was the second biggest in Brazil – 6.3%, more than double the national average in the same period (2.3%). Another segment that deserves to be highlighted is mineral extraction. The pole gesseiro of Araripina is the supplier from 95% of the plaster consumed in Brazil. The pole of data processing of the Recife, Digital Port, despite having started in 2000, is one of the five biggest in Brazil. It employs around three thousand persons, and has 3.5% the GDP of the state.

===Livestock===
According with IBGE 2007, Pernambuco has the 2nd largest livestock portfolio in the Northeast region and the 8th of Brazil.

===Agriculture===


&quot;S – Seasonal; P – Permanent agriculture; + – Thousands units&quot;

===Ethanol===
Pernambuco was once the 5th largest producer of sugarcane in Brazil, but today it ranks 8th, behind São Paulo, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Mato Grosso and Alagoas. Brazil is the second largest producer of alcohol fuel in the world, typically fermenting ethanol from sugarcane and sugar beets. The country produces a total of 18 billion liters annually, of which 3.5 billion are exported, 2 billion of them to the US. Alcohol-fueled cars started in the Brazilian market in 1978 and became quite popular because of heavy subsidy, but in the 80s prices rose and gasoline regained the leading market share.
But from 2004 on, alcohol rapidly increased its market share once again because of new technologies involving hybrid fuel car engines called &quot;Flex&quot; by all major car manufacturers (Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Peugeot, Honda, Citroën, Fiat, etc.). &quot;Flex&quot; engines work with gasoline, alcohol or any mixture of both fuels. As of February 2007, approximately 80% of new vehicles sold in Brazil are hybrid fuel powered. Because of the Brazilian lead in production and technology, many countries became very interested in importing alcohol fuel and adopting the &quot;Flex&quot; vehicle concept.

===Industry===

In 2018, Pernambuco had an industrial GDP of R$32.4 billion, equivalent to 2.5% of the national industry and employing more than 280,000 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Construction (20%), Public Utilities Industrial Services, such as Electricity and Water (17%), Food (14.9%), Petroleum derivatives and biofuels (9.3%) and Motor vehicles (8.8%). These 5 sectors concentrate 70% of the state&#x27;s industry. In only 3 places in the Brazilian Northeast Region, there is some relevant industrial production, one of them being the surroundings of Recife. However, the state continues to have little participation in the Brazilian economy, with the population largely concentrated on the coast.

==Infrastructure==
===Airports===

Recife/Guararapes–Gilberto Freyre International Airport has been open since July 2004 and has 52 thousand square meters of area. The largest airport in the North and Northeast regions, Guararapes had its capacity expanded from 5 million to 11 million passengers a year. Now there are 64 check-in counters, versus the former terminal&#x27;s 24. The shopping and leisure area was also totally remodeled, within the &quot;Aeroshopping&quot; concept, which transforms an airport into a center for business and retail. The commercial spaces will be occupied in steps and the final total will be 142 shops. Since 2000, Recife has had the longest runway in the Northeast, at 3,305 meters. Its extension permits operations with jumbo jets, such as the Boeing , able to fly nonstop to anywhere in South and Central America, Africa and parts of Europe, the United States and Canada.

Pernambuco is also served by the Petrolina International Airport, which is responsible for the delivery of fresh fruit from the São Francisco valley to Europe and the US. The cargo terminal operates with 6 large coolers with 17000 boxes capacity each plus 2 coolers tunnels. This airports also has daily direct connections between this region (which includes 53 municipalities from the states such as Pernambuco, Piaui and Bahia) to major capitals as Recife and Salvador. Like the Recife airport, it is administered by the Brazilian Federal Agency (Infraero).

Other locally administered airports within the state are the Fernando de Noronha Airport and the Caruaru airports. Fernando de Noronhha has daily flights between the islands with Recife and Natal, and the second airport connects the textile industry region of Caruaru with São Paulo and local cities.

===Ports===

*Suape port. Suape serves ships &quot;cargo&quot; 365 days a year without any restrictions in regards to tidal schedules. To assist in the docking operation of the ships, the port offers a monitoring system and laser ship docking system that enables effective, secure control and upholds the same technical standards as the most important ports across the globe. The port moves over 8.4 million tons of cargo a year (has increased 7 times since 1992). The liquid granary (petroleum by-products, chemical products, alcohols, vegetable oils, etc.) constitutes more than 80% of the movement. The port can serve ships of up to 170,000 tpb and operational draft of 14.50 m. With of backport, the internal and external ports offer the necessary conditions for serving large ships. The access canal has 5,000m of extension, 300m in width and 16.5m in length.
Suape has started in the 21st century to be Pernambuco&#x27;s motive power toward development. Huge national and international investments are being attracted by its logistic qualities, of which, until 2010, more than US$10 billion are expected.

*Recife Port handles &quot;cruises and cargo&quot;. National and international cruises are made in this port, mainly of those connecting Fernando de Noronha islands with Brazil, Caribbean islands and South America. The Brazilian and foreign tourists who come to Recife on a cruise ship will use a new &quot;Passengers Terminal&quot; (2009) with stores, food court and information kiosks. Also, will have an increase in depth from 8.4 m to 11.5 meters deep, what originates will no longer be necessary to do transfer between large and small ships as before.
There are two access channels to the Port, both of natural characteristics. The main one, &quot;South Channel&quot;, has 260 m of width and of extension approximately, with a depth of 10.5 m. The other, denominated &quot;North Channel&quot;, has little width, about of length, and a depth of 6.5 m, and it is used only by small size vessels. Handles an average of 2.2 million tons of cargo annually, and the main loads are sugar, wheat, corn, barley, malt, fertilizers, clinker and kelp.

=== Railways ===
Freight trains are operated by , formerly the &quot;Companhia Ferroviária do Nordeste&quot; (CFN), and mainly hauls iron ore, petroleum, and cement. The company won a 30-year concession following the privatization of the RFFSA in 1997, and also serves neighboring states of Ceará and Piauí. The network is built to metre gauge, and is long.

The Recife Metro, opened in 1985, has five lines and is operated by the federally-controlled &quot;Compania Brasileira de Trens Urbanos&quot; (CBTU).

=== Roads ===
==Festivals==
===Carnival===
The four-day period before Lent leading up to Ash Wednesday is carnival time in Brazil. Rich and poor alike forget their cares as they party in the streets. Pernambuco has large Carnaval celebrations, including the &quot;frevo&quot;, typical Pernambuco music. Another carnaval music style from Pernambuco is &quot;maracatu&quot;.

The cities of Recife and Olinda hold the most authentic and democratic carnaval celebrations in Brazil. The largest carnaval parade in all of Brazil is &quot;Galo da Madrugada&quot;, which takes place in downtown Recife in the Saturday of carnaval. Another event is the &quot;Noite dos Tambores Silenciosos&quot;.

Recife&#x27;s joyous Carnaval is nationally known, attracting thousands of people every year. The party starts a week before the official date, with electric trios &quot;shaking&quot; the Boa Viagem district.

On Friday, people take to the streets to enjoy themselves to the sound of frevo and to dance with maracatu, ciranda, caboclinhos, afoxé, reggae and manguebeat (cultural movement created in Recife during the 1990s) groups. There are still many other entertainment centres around the city, featuring local and national artists.

One of the highlights is Saturday when more than one million people follow the Galo da Madrugada group. From Sunday to Monday, there is the Night of the Silent Drums, on the Pátio do Terço, where Maracatus honor slaves that died in prisons.

===Saint John&#x27;s Day===
Festa Junina was introduced to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese, for whom Saint John&#x27;s day (also celebrated as Midsummer Day in several European countries), on 24 June, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Differently, of course, from what happens on the European Midsummer Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the summer solstice, but during the tropical winter solstice. The festivities traditionally begin after 12 June, on the eve of Saint Anthony&#x27;s day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter&#x27;s day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets. Once exclusively a rural festival, today, in Brazil, it is largely a city festival during which people joyfully and theatrically mimic peasant stereotypes and clichés in a spirit of jokes and good times. Typical refreshments and dishes are served, including canjica and pamonha. Like during Carnival, these festivities involve costume-wearing (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). Like what happens on Midsummer and Saint John&#x27;s Day in Europe, bonfires are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.

Saint John&#x27;s Day is celebrated throughout Pernambuco. Nonetheless, the festivities in Caruaru are by far the largest in the state. Saint John&#x27;s festivals in Gravatá and Carpina are also popular.

===Winter Festival===
In the hilly areas of the interior – mainly in areas with a micro-climate of altitude – temperatures that can reach 8 °C in the winter. Every winter, when the weather is milder, tourists from neighboring states and other parts of Pernambuco visit cities such as Garanhuns, Gravatá, Triunfo, Taquaritinga do Norte and Brejo da Madre de Deus.

The city of Garanhuns holds an annual Winter Festival, in the month of July. The main attractions are concerts, dances, rural tourism, culinary and the relatively low temperatures for a tropical climate.

==Tourism and recreation==


The Pernambuco coastline is 187 km long. There are about of beaches, including at Porto de Galinhas, Carneiros and Calhetas.
* Fernando de Noronha, an isolated group of 21 volcanic islands approximately 540 km from Recife. The main islands are the visible parts of a range of submerged mountains, islets and rocks. The Archipelago of Fernando de Noronha hosts ecological sites ideal for exuberant marine animal life, due to its geographic location far from the continent and well within the path of the Southern Equatorial Currents, as well as the nature of its climate.
* Porto de Galinhas. It features warm clear water pools scattered around its coral reefs, estuaries, mangroves, coconut trees and a number of other samples of abundant nature richness make Porto de Galinhas a place not to be missed or forgotten.



* Boa Viagem. Located in the privileged southern Recife metropolitan area, Boa Viagem is the most important and frequented beach in town. It is protected by a long reef wall and has an extensive coastline.
* Itamaracá island. Separated from the mainland by the Canal Santa Cruz, it has several highly frequented beaches. Among them are Forte Orange, Praia do Sossego and Pontal da Ilha. The island houses the Marine Manatee Preservation Center.
* Maracaípe, a beach with big waves which hosts a phase of the Brazilian Surf Tournament. Highly frequented by surfers and neighbor to Porto de Galinhas, Maracaípe.
* Tamandaré. Small waves and fine sand can be found there.
* Calhetas, a small bay of difficult access. Searched for by many for diving.
* Coroa do Avião, a small island in the middle of the Jaguaribe River delta, which can be reached only by boat or raft, from Recife or Itamaracá.

==Main cities==
==Sports==
Football was introduced to Pernambuco in 1902, when English and Dutch sailors disembarked in Recife and played a game of football in the beach. The novelty awoke the interest of the people of Pernambuco, that soon adhered to the game. Recife provides visitors and residents with various sport activities; the city has the largest football teams of the state of Pernambuco. There are several football clubs based in Recife, such as Sport, Santa Cruz, and Náutico.

According to the Brazilian Football Confederation in 2008, the Pernambuco Football Federation was ranked sixth nationwide, behind São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Paraná; and first in the Northeast region. The Pernambuco Football Federation organizes the &quot;Campeonato Pernambucano&quot; state championship and the state cup. The first edition of the &quot;Campeonato Pernambucano&quot; was played in 1915, and was won by Sport Club Flamengo, a club since defunct. In 2011 twelve clubs competed, which was won by Santa Cruz.

In 2012 the state was represented in the highest national level of football (Brazilian Série A) by Náutico and Sport. Also, it was represented in (Série C) by Santa Cruz and Salgueiro and in (Série D) by Central.

Recife was one of the 12 Brazilian cities that hosted the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

<text>In mathematics, a delta operator is a shift-equivariant linear operator formula_1 on the vector space of polynomials in a variable formula_2 over a field formula_3 that reduces degrees by one.

To say that formula_4 is shift-equivariant means that if formula_5, then

:formula_6

In other words, if formula_7 is a &quot;shift&quot; of formula_8, then formula_9 is also a shift of formula_10, and has the same &quot;shifting vector&quot; formula_11.

To say that an operator &quot;reduces degree by one&quot; means that if formula_7 is a polynomial of degree formula_13, then formula_9 is either a polynomial of degree formula_15, or, in case formula_16, formula_9 is 0.

Sometimes a &quot;delta operator&quot; is defined to be a shift-equivariant linear transformation on polynomials in formula_2 that maps formula_2 to a nonzero constant. Seemingly weaker than the definition given above, this latter characterization can be shown to be equivalent to the stated definition when formula_3 has characteristic zero, since shift-equivariance is a fairly strong condition.

==Examples==

* The forward difference operator

:: formula_21

:is a delta operator.

* Differentiation with respect to &quot;x&quot;, written as &quot;D&quot;, is also a delta operator.
* Any operator of the form
::formula_22
: (where &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;(ƒ) = ƒ(&quot;n&quot;) is the &quot;n&quot;th derivative) with formula_23 is a delta operator. It can be shown that all delta operators can be written in this form. For example, the difference operator given above can be expanded as
::formula_24

* The generalized derivative of time scale calculus which unifies the forward difference operator with the derivative of standard calculus is a delta operator.
* In computer science and cybernetics, the term &quot;discrete-time delta operator&quot; (δ) is generally taken to mean a difference operator

:: formula_25

: the Euler approximation of the usual derivative with a discrete sample time formula_26. The delta-formulation obtains a significant number of numerical advantages compared to the shift-operator at fast sampling.

==Basic polynomials==

Every delta operator &quot;formula_4&quot; has a unique sequence of &quot;basic polynomials&quot;, a polynomial sequence defined by three conditions:

* formula_28
* formula_29
* formula_30

Such a sequence of basic polynomials is always of binomial type, and it can be shown that no other sequences of binomial type exist. If the first two conditions above are dropped, then the third condition says this polynomial sequence is a Sheffer sequence—a more general concept.

<doc id="229536" wikidata="Q42722" url="?curid=229536" title="Piauí">
<text>Piauí ( ) is one of the states of Brazil, located in the country&#x27;s Northeast Region. The state has 1.6% of the Brazilian population and produces 0.7% of the Brazilian GDP.

Piauí has the shortest coastline of any coastal Brazilian state at 66 km (41 mi), and the capital, Teresina, is the only state capital in the northeast to be located inland. The reason for this is, unlike the rest of the area, Piauí was first colonised inland and slowly expanded towards the ocean, rather than the other way around. In the southeast of the state, the National Park of Serra da Capivara is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park has more than 400 archaeological sites and the largest concentration of rock paintings in the world, in a landscape dominated by canyons and caatinga.

== History ==

The state has many notable archaeological sites, including Serra de Capivara National Park and Sete Cidades National Park, which are rich in remains of prehistoric Paleo-Indian and sedentary-based Indigenous Brazilian complex cultures.

Early settlers in the region included Francisco Dias d&#x27;Ávila from state of Bahia, who brought the first herds of cattle to the area; and Domingos Afonso Mafrense, from Portugal, who founded what is today Oeiras.

In the 17th century, many impoverished noblemen and Jesuit priests, as well as black and Amerindian slaves, settled there. The first large-scale cattle farming also arrived with these settlers. Large estate owners seeking new pastures for their livestock arrived from neighbouring states such as Bahia and Maranhão.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the principal industry of the state was stock raising, which dates from the first settlement in 1674 by Domingos Afonso Mafrense, who established a number of cattle ranges. A secondary industry was the raising of goats, which were able to stand neglect and a scanty food supply. Agricultural products were cotton, sugar and tobacco. Forest products included rubber, carnauba wax and dyewoods. Exports included hides, skins, rubber, wax, tobacco and cotton.

Teresina was the first Brazilian city to be planned. In 1852, an architect designed it, after being inspired by a chessboard. Situated at the confluence of the Parnaíba and Poti Rivers, Teresina was (and still is) known as the Green City because of the countless mango trees that line the city&#x27;s streets.

==Geography==

Piauí is bounded on the west by Maranhão, on the east by Ceará and Pernambuco, to the west by Tocantins, and to the south by Bahia. It has a short Atlantic coastline on the north.

The Parnaíba River forms the boundary with Maranhão throughout its entire length; the state lies almost entirely within the basin of the Parnaíba and its tributaries. Part of the state on the Atlantic coast and along the lower Parnaíba is low, swampy, and historically malarial. South of this the country rises gradually to a plateau with open campos. This plateau region is watered by numerous tributaries of the Parnaíba, chief of which are, from south to north: the Poti, which has its source in the state of Ceará; the Longa; the Canindé and its tributary the Piauí, which is navigable for boats of one-meter draft up to Nova Iorque, a few miles above the mouth of the Gurguéia River. The river valleys are separated by flat-topped plateaus called &quot;chapadas,&quot; including the Serra Uruçui, which lies between the Uruçui-Preto and the Gurguéia, the Serra da Capivara National Park, which lies between the Gurguéia and the Piauí, and the Chapada das Mangabeiras, which forms the southwestern boundary of the state, separating the upper basin of the Parnaíba from that of the Tocantins.

===Ecoregions===
The sandy soils along the Atlantic coast are home to the Northeastern Brazil restingas, low evergreen forests adapted to the nutrient-poor conditions. The lower basin of the Parnaíba is home to the Maranhão Babaçu forests, which extend westward into Maranhão. This ecoregion is dominated by stands of the Babaçu palm.
The eastern portion of the state is dominated by the dry Caatingas shrublands, which extend across much of northeastern Brazil. The Cerrado savannas extend across the southwestern portion of the state, in the basins of the upper Parnaíba and Gurguéia rivers. Enclaves of Atlantic dry forests lie in basin of the Gurguéia, forming a transition between the Cerrado and Caatinga. Serra da Capivara National Park is located in the Caatinga of the south-central part of the state, and protects numerous caves with ancient cave paintings.

===Climate===
The climate is hot and humid in the lowlands and along the lower Parnaíba, but in the uplands it is dry with high day-time temperatures and cool nights.

==Demographics==

According to the 2022 census, there were 3,271,199 people residing in the state. The population density was 13 inhabitants/km2.

Urbanization: 60.7% (2006); Population growth: 1.1% (1991–2000); Houses: 791,000 (2006).

The last census in 2022 revealed the following numbers: 2,120,880 Brown (Multiracial) people (64.8%), 740,322 White people (22.6%), 400,662 Black people (12.2%), 6,198 Amerindian people (0.2%), 3.078 Asian people (0.1%).

=== Largest cities ===
=== Religion ===
The population of Piauí is mostly Christian. According to the IBGE, it is the state with the lowest proportion of Protestants, and the highest proportion of Catholics in the country. There is a great diversity of religious manifestations in Piauí, expressing the multicultural identity of the Piauí people. According to a survey conducted via an app developed by the Municipality of Teresina, there are more than 800 adherents of Afro-Brazilian religions in the capital. Considering that there are 800 thousand inhabitants in the municipality, there is practically one adherent for every thousand inhabitants. In addition to Christianity and other monotheistic religions, Piauí also has followers of polytheistic spiritualities, such as Piaganismo, who is considered the first neo-pagan religion created in Brazil.

===Education===
Portuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools, but English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.

====Educational institutions====
Educational institutions in Piauí include:
* Universidade Federal do Piauí (UFPI) (Federal University of Piauí)
* Universidade Federal do Vale do São Francisco (UNIVASF)
* Universidade Estadual do Piauí (Uespi) (State University of Piauí)
* Instituto Federal do Piauí (IFPI)
* Faculdade Santo Agostinho
* Centro de Ensino Superior do Vale do Parnaíba (Cesvale)
* Instituto de Ciências Jurídicas e Sociais Professor Camillo Filho
* Faculdade de Saúde, Ciências Humanas e Tecnológicas do Piauí
* Faculdade Integral Differencial (Facid)

==Economy==
Piauí is one of the poorest states of Brazil. The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 60.1%, followed by the industrial sector at 27.3%. Agriculture represents 12.6% of GDP (2004). Piauí exports include essential oils 19.5%, soybeans 17.1%, woven cotton 15.1%, cashews 12.6%, crustaceans 12.4%, and leather 8.3% (2002).

Grupo Claudino is the largest industrial company with headquarters in the state. They have annual sales of around R$700 million.

Transfers from the Federal government are estimated to represent around a third of state GDP.

The state government has been involved in a number of initiatives to develop aspects of the state&#x27;s economy. 10,000-18,000 hectares of land worth a reported R$50 million was given to Brasil Biodiesel, a green energy company. The company suffered a number of setbacks and in 2009 said it was selling the land. A second biodiesel company, Piauí Ecodiesel Ltda, is reported to be receiving up to R$81.1 million of investment.

The state has offered substantial tax benefits to agro-industrial companies. Bunge, Cargill and Algar now grow soy in the state. Suzano is to grow eucalyptus for pulp. These projects have been criticised by state environmental activists.

According to research commissioned by SETUR, the state tourism authority, over one million tourists would visit Piauí in 2010. Estimates based on by CEPRO, the state statistics agency, suggest the actual figure is likely to fractional of this figure. The construction of an international airport at São Raimundo Nonato (Aeroporto Internacional Serra da Capivara) was criticised on the grounds that it could not function as an international airport because the runway was too short and because ANAC (the Federal aviation authority) was not involved in monitoring the project, so were unable to certify it as safe for international flights.

There is some mining in the state, including South America&#x27;s only opal mines at Pedro Segundo. Diamonds are mined by Gema do Piauí Mineração Ltda (Gemapi) and processed in the neighbouring state of Pernambuco in a joint-venture with Gitanjali Group (India). The state has significant deposits of nickel and iron ore. João Carlos Cavalcanti, a mining entrepreneur, and GME4 own the rights to the 800 million tonne PI4 iron ore deposit. A new railway bisecting the state may make this deposit economically viable.

Share of the Brazilian economy: 0.5% (2004).

==Culture==

===Festa Junina (Saint John Festival)===
Festa Junina is a cultural festival inspired by Portuguese traditions, in which St John&#x27;s day, on the June 24, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Unlike the European Midsummer&#x27;s Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place at the summer solstice but during the southern hemisphere&#x27;s winter solstice. The festivities traditionally begin after the 12th of June, on the eve of St Anthony&#x27;s day, and last until the 29th, which is St Peter&#x27;s day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Once exclusively a rural festival, today in Brazil it is largely a city festival during which people mimic peasant stereotypes and clichés and consume typical refreshments and dishes. As in Carnival, these festivities involve costumes (in this case, peasant garb), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). As on Midsummer and St John&#x27;s Day in Europe, bonfires are a central part of the festivities.

===Carnival===
The four-day period before Lent leading up to Ash Wednesday is carnival time in Brazil.

== Infrastructure ==

===National Airport===

Teresina/Senador Petrônio Portella Airport is located four kilometers () from downtown Teresina. Opened in 1967, it has been administered by Infraero since 1975. There are no international flights to this airport.

== Flag ==
The flag of Piauí was unveiled on 24 July 1922. The blue canton and a star represents the state itself and the green and yellow bars represent Piauí&#x27;s union with Brazil. In 2005 the words &quot;13 DE MARÇO DE 1823&quot; were added below the star to commemorate the date of the Battle of Jenipapo, an engagement in Brazil&#x27;s war of independence.
