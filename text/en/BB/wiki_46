<text>Inspector Gadget (French: Inspecteur Gadget) is an animated science fiction comedy series co-created by Andy Heyward, Jean Chalopin and Bruno Bianchi, and was originally syndicated by DIC Audiovisuel and Lexington Broadcast Services Company. The show revolves around the adventures of a clumsy, dim-witted police officer from Metro City named Inspector Gadgeta police inspector with various bionic gadgets built into his bodywho is sent on missions to thwart plans by his nemesis Dr. Claw, the leader of an evil organization known as &quot;M.A.D.&quot;, while unknowingly being assisted by his niece Penny and their dog, Brain.

The series stars the voice of Don Adams as the titular character, and it first premiered on December 4, 1982, as an exclusive pilot. It is the first cartoon show to be syndicated by DIC, who specifically created the series to help expand into the North American market, and the first animated series to be presented in stereo sound. The program originally ran from 1983 to 1985, broadcasting 86 episodes over two seasons, and remained in syndication into the late 1990s. The TV series proved to be a success for DIC, not only launching the &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; franchise, including additional animated productions, such as a 2015 sequel series, and two live-action films, but also encouraging the company to produce additional programs such as &quot;Heathcliff&quot;. In January 2009, IGN named &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; as the 54th best in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows.

Since 2012, the rights to &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; have been owned by WildBrain (formerly DHX Media) through its in-name-only unit, Cookie Jar Entertainment. Cookie Jar had purchased DiC and its library of shows in 2008, and was itself acquired by DHX Media in 2012.

== Premise ==
Inspector Gadget, the titular character of the series, is a world-famous cyborg police inspector who works for a secret police organization that combats crime across the globe, with each of his missions focused on thwarting the criminal schemes of M.A.D. (which stands for &quot;Mean And Dirty&quot;)a criminal organization led by the nefarious Dr. Claw, and conducted by his agents. Missions that he undertakes often occur in a foreign locale, or within the fictional city of Metro City. Despite the fact that Inspector Gadget is equipped with numerous gadgets to help him, including a personal vehicle that can morph between a family minivan to a compact police car, he is ultimately incompetent and clueless on each mission—proposing ludicrous theories behind a crime or mistaking M.A.D. agents for friendly locals. He often uses a gadget that he did not call for, and is sometimes prone to causing trouble inadvertently for those around himan example of this is a running gag, inspired by the &quot;self-destruct&quot; message, in which Inspector Gadget is given briefing messages from his boss Chief Quimby, who primarily hands them to him while in disguise, only to have them unintentionally returned to him before they detonate.

In reality, the investigations are often conducted by Inspector Gadget&#x27;s niece Penny, who has a gifted sleuthing mind despite her young age and secretly operates behind the scenes to thwart M.A.D.&#x27;s plot and ensure that her uncle remains out of harm&#x27;s way, as Dr. Claw frequently instructs his agents to get rid of Inspector Gadget before he can stop them, in denial that she is his real enemy. Even though Inspector Gadget is incompetent, he always escapes danger due to luck, either from a misfired gadget, or from the secret assistance of the family dog Brain, who usually shadows him in disguise; on most occasions, his disguise often causes Inspector Gadget to chase him in the mistaken belief that he is a M.A.D. agent. While Penny remains in contact with Brain during her investigation, she is often placed in danger and either escapes by recalling Brain to help, or using her own technology. Despite the pair&#x27;s involvement, both make it certain that Inspector Gadget is seen to have completed the mission in Quimby&#x27;s opinion; yet in most cases, it is either Penny and Brain&#x27;s background activities or just luck through which Inspector Gadget actually completes a mission. Dr. Claw always vows revenge on Inspector Gadget for thwarting his schemes, and flees the scene on most occasions having been on site to oversee his plans.

Like many cartoons made in the 1980s, &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; always ended each episode with a public service announcement advising how to handle a situation, such as the danger of dealing with strangers.

== Characters ==
* Inspector Gadget (&quot;Inspecteur Gadget&quot; in French) (voiced by Jesse White in the pilot (1st version), Gary Owens in the pilot (2nd version) and by Don Adams in the pilot (3rd version) and main series): The main protagonist of the series. Despite being brave, well-intentioned and laden with many gadgets in his body, he is frequently absent-minded and clueless, bungles his cases and gets himself into danger, only escaping from trouble and completing his missions with luck (though in the earliest produced episodes, Gadget was halfway brilliant, deducing that Dr. Claw is nearby and even became infuriated when he lost his nemesis in a high-speed chase). A policeman by nature, he is a caring family man that often takes risks to protect his niece Penny and their dog Brain, and has a firm disbelief in the supernatural. His character often utters four catchphrases during episodes&quot;Wowsers!&quot;, at times of shock and complete surprise; &quot;Go-Go-Gadget&quot;, which is often spoken before Gadget names the gadget he intends to use; &quot;Is that you, Chief? You&#x27;re where?&quot;, uttered when Chief Quimby calls Gadget on his next assignment; and &quot;I&#x27;m always on duty&quot;, which is also said to Quimby before Gadget leaves for his assignment. He often introduces himself with, &quot;My name is Inspector Gadget&quot;, and otherwise it is implied that &quot;Inspector&quot; is his actual first name (rather than a title) and &quot;Gadget&quot; his surname.
* Penny (&quot;Sophie&quot; in French) (voiced by Mona Marshall in the pilot episode, Cree Summer in Season 1 and Holly Berger in Season 2): Inspector Gadget&#x27;s highly intelligent niece. She is the true &quot;brains&quot; behind Inspector Gadget&#x27;s investigations, and the one responsible for foiling M.A.D.&#x27;s schemes, a fact only known to Brain. Her investigations are conducted in secret, in which she uses two pieces of technologya hi-tech computer disguised as a book; and a special utility wristwatch, which she frequently uses to communicate with Brain and monitor her uncle&#x27;s activities with. Penny often gets kidnapped by M.A.D. when they catch her snooping into their affairs, but manages to escape with her technology or by calling on Brain for help.
* Brain (&quot;Finot&quot; in French) (voiced by Frank Welker): The family&#x27;s anthropomorphic beagle, assists in investigations by secretly keeping Gadget out of danger, and on several occasions coming to Penny&#x27;s aid when she needs him. The series&#x27; writers designed the character to be highly intelligent and resourceful, often becoming bipedal in order to operate under a number of disguises aimed at fooling Gadget and/or the M.A.D. Agents. A running gag is that Gadget will typically befriend M.A.D. Agents and remain oblivious to their attempts to kill him, while exclusively perceiving Brain as a M.A.D. Agent he needs to arrest. Brain is outfitted with a hi-tech collar that conceals a retractable video communications system linked to Penny&#x27;s wristwatch, in which he communicates to her through a mixture of pantomime and physical gestures. By Season 2, Brain was using this video link to &#x27;talk&#x27; to Penny in dog-talk reminiscent of Scooby-Doo.
* Chief Frank Quimby (&quot;Chef Gontier&quot; in French) (voiced by Dan Hennessey in Season 1 and Maurice LaMarche in Season 2): Inspector Gadget&#x27;s short-tempered boss. The chief of police in Metro City, Quimby specializes in the use of disguises in order to pass on a message containing Inspector Gadget&#x27;s briefing for his next message, a frequent plot element used at the beginning of each episode, as well as seeing him towards the end to congratulate him on a job well done, never realizing that Inspector Gadget&#x27;s niece is responsible for foiling Dr. Claw&#x27;s plots or alerting him secretly to where he and the police need to be. As a running gag, Inspector Gadget is oblivious to the message&#x27;s &quot;self-destruct&quot; element and returns it to his boss prior to it blowing up, always unintentionally and occasionally through sheer bad luck on Quimby&#x27;s part. The character is frequently portrayed with a pipe in his mouth, is often on the receiving end of a mishap from Inspector Gadget&#x27;s bumbling nature, and is accompanied by his own theme music during his main scene in the episode.
* Dr. Claw (&quot;Docteur Gang&quot; in French) (voiced by Frank Welker and Don Francks): The leader of the evil M.A.D. organization. Dr. Claw often operates his schemes via a computer terminal, while accompanied by his pet cat M.A.D. Cat (a reference to James Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld), usually either within a base that is often depicted as an old castle, or from within his personal craft the M.A.D. Mobilea black-and-red vehicle that can transform between a car, jet, and submersible, which he always escapes in when his latest scheme has failed whilst he is on location at or near where it is being conducted. Dr. Claw considers Inspector Gadget to be his greatest nemesis, despite being aware of his idiocy, but does know about Penny and Brain&#x27;s involvement in his missions; however, both he and his M.A.D. agents presume they are simply under orders by Inspector Gadget to spy on their operations, and are never fully aware that they are the real brains behind his schemes being thwarted. The character always uses his catchphrase&quot;I&#x27;ll get you next time, Gadget! Next time!&quot;at the end of each episode (during the end credits), often to illustrate his desire for revenge against Inspector Gadget. He is never seen, aside from his arms.
* Corporal Capeman (voiced by Townsend Coleman): Inspector Gadget&#x27;s sidekick, introduced in the second season. Capeman is a self-proclaimed superhero who acts in the manner of a stereotypical crime fighter; yet, despite being more observant of details than the Inspector, he is equally as inept at interpreting them. Capeman dislikes Brain and is occasionally mean to him, despite Brain getting him out of trouble. Capeman is obsessed with learning to fly and often mistakenly believes he has miraculously acquired the power of flight while in the midst of dire circumstances. Gadget almost always mispronounces Capeman&#x27;s name as &quot;Capman&quot;, while Penny calls him &quot;Capey&quot;.

== Episodes ==
== Production ==
=== Origin ===
In 1981, &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; creator Andy Heyward left Hanna-Barbera and traveled to Paris to work with DIC Audiovisuel after being proposed by the company to do so. As the company wanted entertainment for the United States, Heyward combined ideas to originate Inspector Gadget. Many ideas were inspired by &quot;Dynomutt, Dog Wonder&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. Due to concerns that the show would not appeal to girls, Penny was created for the show. Brain was named to conceive the idea that &quot;he is smart while Inspector Gadget [is the opposite].&quot;

Chalopin, who at the time owned the DIC Audiovisuel studio, helped develop the format and concept for the rest of the episodes together with Bruno Bianchi, who designed the main characters and served as supervising director. Part of the project&#x27;s existence was to recoup costs incurred by DiC and Tokyo Movie Shinsha when a planned collaboration, a spin-off of &quot;Lupin the Third&quot; called &quot;Lupin VIII&quot;, was cancelled due to financial disputes with the estate of Arsène Lupin creator Maurice Leblanc.

=== Designs ===
When production started, the model of Inspector Gadget was broken down for gadgets that needed to be created. The original design of Inspector Gadget was done in Paris. It included helicopter blades and was based on Andy Heyward and one of the directors of the series. It was scrapped from the writers&#x27; confusion of the design, and production assistant Mike Maliani and Andy Heyward simplified the designs to avoid confusion. Gadget went through approximately 350 sketches before reaching his final design. Inspector Gadget originally had a mustache (as shown in the pilot). It was removed after DIC received a letter from MGM (which already acquired United Artists) that he looked too similar to Inspector Clouseau from &quot;Pink Panther&quot;.

=== Writers ===
Nelvana writer Peter Sauder was the head writer for season 1, which was co-produced by DiC. As Nelvana was no longer part of the production by season 2, the show was written by the DIC studio employees Eleanor Burian-Mohr, Mike O&#x27;Mahoney, Glen Egbert, and Jack Hanrahan. Hanrahan and Burian-Mohr would later write the Christmas special &quot;Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas&quot; as well as many episodes of the &quot;Gadget Boy&quot; spinoff series, and Burian-Mohr additionally wrote dialogue for the educational show &quot;Inspector Gadget&#x27;s Field Trip&quot;.

Due to various recurring elements in the series, the basic plot of each episode was often the same. The geographic location of each episode differed, and it provided for some variety in the series. The series effectively provided viewers with both comedic and dramatic moments. Despite the censorship standards for American animated series in effect during the 1970s and 1980s, the series also included elements of slapstick comedy. This was nearly forbidden at the time, but the censorship was less strict for a syndication series.

=== Animation ===
Alongside &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; was Nelvana&#x27;s first foray into animation outsourcing. Most of episodes from the first season were animated in Japan by Tokyo Movie Shinsha, while a few episodes were animated in Taiwan by Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest Studio, before being finished in post production by DiC and Nelvana. The pilot episode, &quot;Winter Olympics&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Gadget in Wonderland&quot;), was animated by TMS&#x27;s subsidiary Telecom Animation Film, who had a slightly higher budget than the rest of the episodes. The additional production facilities are AIC, Oh! Production. Sunrise, and Toei Animation who helped with the cel painting process for the TMS-animated episodes.

Nelvana was not involved with the show&#x27;s 21-episode second season, for which pre-production was moved to DiC&#x27;s own Los Angeles-based headquarters. The animation and post-production was generally done at K.K. DiC Asia (later Creativity &amp; Development Asia), a Japanese animation house Jean Chalopin co-founded that DiC had some ownership in at the time.

=== Voice cast ===
The role of Inspector Gadget went through two different voice actors before Don Adams was cast. The first voice of Inspector Gadget was provided by Jesse White, but his voice characteristics were not tested well. Gary Owens auditioned the voice of Inspector Gadget with ad-libs, including his catchphrase &quot;Wowsers!&quot;. Eventually, producers decided to cast actor Don Adams in the role, re-recording all of Inspector Gadget&#x27;s dialogue in the pilot from Jesse White and Gary Owens.

Dr. Claw, M.A.D. Cat, and Brain were voiced by Frank Welker. Welker and Adams recorded their dialogue in separate sessions in Los Angeles, while the rest of the first season&#x27;s cast recorded in Toronto. Don Francks initially replaced Welker as Dr. Claw for 25 episodes following the pilot before Welker was called in to replace him for those episodes. However, Welker was unable to re-record a few episodes, where Francks&#x27; voice remained. Francks remained with the show, however, and usually performed the voice of a henchman of Dr. Claw. Sometimes Francks would portray a secondary M.A.D. agent, with Welker (who usually performed the voices of the agents otherwise) as the other in episodes where Francks&#x27; voice was necessary. Penny was originally voiced by Mona Marshall in the pilot and was subsequently portrayed by Don Francks&#x27; daughter, Cree Summer, for the rest of the first season in her first voice acting role. Chief Quimby was voiced by John Stephenson in the original pilot, and later by Dan Hennessey for the remainder of the first season.

After the pilot, all of the first season episodes were voice-recorded in Toronto at the Nelvana facilities. When production of &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; moved from Nelvana in Toronto to DiC&#x27;s headquarters in Los Angeles for the second season, all of the Canadian-based voice artists were replaced. Holly Berger replaced Cree Summer Francks as the voice of Penny while Maurice LaMarche replaced Hennessey as the voice of Chief Quimby. Occasionally, LaMarche would fill in for Don Adams as Inspector Gadget whenever necessary.

=== Music ===
The theme music was inspired by Edvard Grieg&#x27;s movement &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; and was composed by Shuki Levy. For many years, Levy had a partnership with his friend Haim Saban, with Levy composing the music and Saban running the business. Their record company, Saban Records, (now Saban Music Group) has provided music for many DiC cartoons and children&#x27;s shows in the 1980s and 1990s, and is still running today. A soundtrack LP to accompany the series, named &quot;Inspecteur Gadget: Bande Originale de la Serie TV&quot;, was released in France in 1983 by Saban Records. Wagram Music made it available on online services such as Spotify and iTunes. An English-language soundtrack LP, entitled &quot;Inspector Gadget – The Music&quot;, was released in Australia in 1986 through ABC Records. While many of its tracks overlapped with those of the French LP, five tracks were exclusive to the Australian LP.

In her book &quot;Robot Takeover: 100 Iconic Robots of Myth, Popular Culture &amp; Real Life&quot;, Scissor Sisters singer Ana Matronic says she considers the theme music to be widely recognized around the world. The series was a &quot;global hit&quot; and its theme song became &quot;iconic&quot;. However, she notes that copies of the original television soundtrack had become extremely rare by 2010.

<doc id="232894" wikidata="Q170377" url="?curid=232894" title="Blackpool">
<text>Blackpool is a seaside town in Lancashire, England. It is located on the Irish Sea coast of the Fylde peninsula, approximately north of Liverpool and west of Preston. It is the main settlement in the borough of the same name.

Blackpool was originally a small hamlet; it began to grow in the mid-eighteenth century, when sea bathing for health purposes became fashionable. Blackpool&#x27;s beach was suitable for this activity, and by 1781 several hotels had been built. The opening of a railway station in 1846 allowed more visitors to reach the resort, which continued to grow for the remainder of the nineteenth century. In 1876, the town became a borough. Blackpool&#x27;s development was closely tied to the Lancashire cotton-mill practice of annual factory maintenance shutdowns, known as wakes weeks, when many workers chose to visit the seaside. The town saw large growth during the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. By 1951 its population had reached 147,000.

In the late 20th century, changing holiday preferences and increased overseas travel impacted Blackpool&#x27;s standing as a leading resort. Despite economic challenges, the town&#x27;s urban fabric and economy remain centred around tourism. Today, Blackpool&#x27;s seafront, featuring landmarks such as Blackpool Tower, Illuminations, Pleasure Beach, and the Winter Gardens, continue to draw millions of visitors annually. The town is home to football club Blackpool F.C.. The population of Blackpool at the 2021 census was 141,000, a decrease of 1,100 since the 2011 census.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1970, a 13,500-year-old elk skeleton was found with man-made barbed bone points. Now displayed in the Harris Museum this provided the first evidence of humans living on the Fylde. The Fylde was also home to a British tribe, the Setantii (the &quot;dwellers in the water&quot;) a sub-tribe of the Brigantes. Some of the earliest villages on the Fylde, which were later to become part of Blackpool town, were named in the Domesday Book in 1086.

In medieval times Blackpool emerged as a few farmsteads on the coast within Layton-with-Warbreck, the name coming from &quot;le pull&quot;, a stream that drained Marton Mere and Marton Moss into the sea. The stream ran through peatlands that discoloured the water, so the name for the area became &quot;Black Poole&quot;. In the 15th century the area was just called &quot;Pul&quot;, and a 1532 map calls the area &quot;the pole howsys alias the north howsys&quot;.

In 1602, entries in Bispham Parish Church baptismal register include both &quot;Poole&quot; and for the first time &quot;blackpoole&quot;. The first house of any substance, Foxhall, was built by the Tyldesley family of Myerscough Lodge and existed in the latter part of the 17th century. By the end of that century it was occupied by squire and diarist Thomas Tyldesley, grandson of the Royalist Sir Thomas Tyldesley. An Act of Parliament in 1767 enclosed a common, mostly sand hills on the coast, that stretched from Spen Dyke southwards (see Main Dyke).

====Sea bathing and the growth of seaside resorts====
In the 18th century, sea bathing gained popularity for health benefits, drawing visitors to Blackpool as a tourist resort. By 1788, there were about 50 houses on the sea bank. Of these around six accommodated wealthy visitors while a number of other private dwellings lodged the &quot;inferior class whose sole motive for visiting this airy region was health&quot;. In 1781, The town&#x27;s amenities, including hotels, archery stall, and bowling greens, slowly expanded. By 1801, the population reached 473. Henry Banks, instrumental in Blackpool&#x27;s growth, purchased Lane Ends estate in 1819, building the first holiday cottages in 1837.

===19th century===

By the early 19th century, small purpose-built facilities began catering for a middle-class market, although substantial numbers of working people from manufacturing towns were &quot;being drawn to Blackpool&#x27;s charms&quot;. In 1846, a pivotal event marked the early growth of the town: the completion of a railway branch line to Blackpool from Poulton. This spurred development as visitors flocked in by rail, boosting the town&#x27;s economy. Blackpool prospered with the construction of accommodations and attractions, fostering rapid growth in the 1850s and 1860s. A Board of Health was established in 1851, gas lighting in 1852, and piped water in 1864. The town&#x27;s population exceeded 2,500 by 1851.

North Pier opened in 1863, designed by Eugenius Birch for Blackpool&#x27;s &quot;better classes&quot;, and always retained its unique qualities of being a quieter, more reflective place compared with Blackpool&#x27;s other two piers. The following half century included the construction of two further piers – South Pier (now Central Pier) in 1868 and Victoria (now South Pier) in 1893 – the Winter Gardens (1878), Blackpool Tower (1894) and the earliest surviving rides at Blackpool Pleasure Beach (founded in 1896).

Blackpool&#x27;s Royal Palace Gardens at Raikes Hall was a world-famous destination for variety and music hall stars from the mid-18th century. It boasted a Grand Opera House, Indian Room for theatrical and variety performances, a Niagara café with cyclorama, a skating rink and fern house, an elaborate conservatory, monkey house, aviary and outside dancing platform for several thousand people. The gardens also had carriage drives and walkways with Grecian and Roman statues for promenaders to enjoy. There was also a boating lake and a racing track with grandstand for several thousand. More than 40,000 visitors passed through its gates during the opening week in 1872.

Working-class tourists dominated the heart of the resort, which was the go-to destination for workers from the industrial north and their families. Entire towns would close down their industries during Wakes weeks between June and September, with a different town on holiday each week. Communities would travel to Blackpool together, first by charabanc and later by train. But Blackpool still catered for a &quot;significant middle-class market during the spring and autumn&quot; favouring the residential area of North Shore.
Blackpool&#x27;s growth since the 1870s was shaped by its pioneering use of electrical power. Electric lighting came to Blackpool in 1879, as it became the world&#x27;s first municipality with electric street lighting along the promenade, setting the stage for the Blackpool Illuminations. 100,000 people congregated to see the promenade illuminated on the evening of 19 September 1879.

Work started in Blackpool on the UK&#x27;s first electric public tramway on 24 February 1884 and the Blackpool Tramway officially opened on 29 September 1885. It established one of the world&#x27;s earliest electric tramways, initially operated by the Blackpool Electric Tramway Company. By 1899, the tramway expanded, and the conduit system was replaced by overhead wires. The system still remains in service. Blackpool became one of the first towns to mark important civic events with illuminated tram-cars when five Corporation trams were decorated with coloured lights to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897.

By the 1890s, Blackpool had a population of 35,000 and could host 250,000 holidaymakers. Notable structures, like the Grand Theatre (1894) and Blackpool Tower, emerged. The Grand Theatre was among Britain&#x27;s first all-electric theatres. The Victorian and Edwardian period saw a significant construction of hotels and other accommodation, including the Grand Metropole Hotel (1873 but incorporating an earlier hotel that had opened in 1785), the Imperial Hotel (1867) and the Norbreck Castle Hotel (1912). These hotels remain extant.

In 1897, Blackpool Corporation prohibited &quot;phrenologists, &quot;quack&quot; doctors, palmists, mock auctions and cheap jacks&quot; hawking on Blackpool sands. The outliers moved onto Central Promenade where they erected stalls in front gardens. The stretch became known as the Golden Mile and sideshows became one of its key features until the 1960s.

===1900 to 1960s===
In 1911, the town&#x27;s Central Station was the busiest in the world, and in July 1936, 650 trains came and went in a single day. In May 1912 Princess Louise officially opened a new section of North Promenade – Princess Parade – and lights were erected to mark the occasion. The First World War called a temporary halt to the display in 1914 but by 1925 the lights were back with giant animated tableaux being added and extending the Blackpool Illuminations to almost six miles from Squires Gate to Red Bank Road.

The inter-war period saw Blackpool develop and mature as a holiday destination. By 1920 Blackpool had around eight million visitors per year, still drawn largely from the mill towns of East Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Blackpool&#x27;s population boom was complete by 1951, by which time some 147,000 people were living in the town – compared with 47,000 in 1901 and 14,000 in 1881. In the 1920s and 1930s, Blackpool was Britain&#x27;s most popular resort, which JB Priestley referred to as &quot;the great, roaring, spangled beast&quot;. It provided visitors with entertainment and accommodation on an industrial scale. At its height it hosted more than 10 million visitors a year and its entertainment venues could seat more than 60,000 people. During the Second World War, the illuminations were again suspended from 1939, not resuming until 1948.

Blackpool remained a popular resort through much of the 20th century and, in contrast to most resorts, increased in size during World War II – remaining open while others closed and with many civil servants and military personnel sent to live and work there. The town continued to attract more visitors in the decade after the war, reaching a peak of 17 million per year.

===1960s to present===
By the 1960s the UK tourism industry was undergoing radical changes. The increasing popularity of package holidays took many of Blackpool&#x27;s traditional visitors abroad. The construction of the M55 motorway in 1975 made Blackpool more feasible as a day trip rather than an overnight stay. The modern economy, however, remains relatively undiversified and firmly rooted in the tourism sector.

Many seaside resorts fell from grace during the latter half of the 20th century as mobility, wealth, visitor aspirations and competition were in a state of flux, but Blackpool managed to retain its popular/working-class appeal as the &quot;Las Vegas of the North&quot;.

Despite economic restructuring, increased competition and other challenges, Blackpool continues as a seaside visitor destination. Tourism in the town supports 25,000 full-time equivalent jobs – one in five of the workforce. In 2023 the town was named the nation&#x27;s best-value holiday destination. In 2021 18.8 million visitors contributed £1.5 billion to the local economy, making Blackpool the nation&#x27;s biggest seaside resort. In 2022 the resort attracted a further 1.5 million visitors – a total figure of 20.33 million, contributing £1.7bn to the local economy and supporting more than 22,000 jobs.

== Geography ==
=== Physical ===

Blackpool rests in the middle of the western edge of The Fylde, which is a coastal plain atop a peninsula. The seafront consists of a 7-mile sandy beach, with a flat coastline in the south of the district, which rises once past the North Pier to become the North Cliffs, with the highest point nearby at the Bispham Rock Gardens at around . The majority of the town district is built up, with very little semi-rural space such as at Marton Mere. Due to the low-lying terrain, Blackpool experiences occasional flooding, with a large-scale project completed in 2017 to rebuild the seawall and promenade to mitigate this.

===Climate===
Blackpool has a temperate maritime climate according to the Köppen climate classification system. Typically, cool summers, frequent overcast skies and small annual temperature range fluctuations.

The minimum temperature recorded was , recorded during December 1981, however was recorded in January 1881.

The absolute maximum temperature recorded in Blackpool was during a 2022 United Kingdom heat wave. During an average summer, the warmest temperature reached between 1991 and 2020.

Precipitation averages slightly less than , with over 1 mm of precipitation occurring on 147 days of the year.


=== Green belt ===

Blackpool is within a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the Blackpool urban area and other nearby conurbations in Lancashire from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting development deemed as inappropriate within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on the permitted building.

As the town&#x27;s urban area is highly built up, only (2017) of green belt exists within the borough, covering the cemetery, its grounds and nearby academy/college playing fields by Carleton, as well as the football grounds near the airport by St Annes. Further afield, portions are dispersed around the wider Blackpool urban area into the surrounding Lancashire districts of Fylde and Wyre, helping to keep the settlements of Lytham St Annes, Poulton-le-Fylde, Warton/Freckleton and Kirkham separated.

==Demographics==
Blackpool&#x27;s population was approximately 141,000 in 2021 according to census figures – a fall of 0.7 per cent from the 2011 census. It is one of five North West local authority areas to have recorded a fall in this period, during which the figure for England as a whole rose by 6.6 per cent. Blackpool is the third most densely populated local authority in the North West, with 4,046 people per square kilometre, compared with 4,773 in Manchester and 4,347 in Liverpool.

In 2021, 41 per cent of Blackpool residents reported having &#x27;No religion&#x27;, up from 24.5 per cent in 2011. Across England the percentage increased from 24.8 per cent to 36.7 per cent. However, because the census question about religion was voluntary and has varying response rates, the ONS warns that &#x27;caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses&#x27;.

According to the 2021 census, 49.5 per cent of residents aged 16 years and over were employed (excluding full-time students), with 3.8 per cent unemployed (a drop from 5.4 per cent in 2011). The proportion of retired residents was 23.8 per cent. Just over a tenth of people aged 16 and over worked 15 hours or less a week.

Blackpool&#x27;s population is forecast to rise slightly to 141,500 by 2044, with the 45-64-year-old group showing the greatest decrease. The number of residents over 65 years old is projected to rise to almost 36,000, making up 26 per cent of the total population.

==Governance and politics==
There is just one tier of local government covering Blackpool, being the unitary authority of Blackpool Council, which is based at Blackpool Town Hall on Talbot Square.

Parts of the Blackpool Urban Area extend beyond the borough boundaries of Blackpool into the neighbouring boroughs of Wyre (which includes Fleetwood, Cleveleys, Thornton and Poulton-le-Fylde) and Fylde (which covers Lytham St Annes).

===Administrative history===
Blackpool was historically part of the township of Layton with Warbreck, which was part of the ancient parish of Bispham. The township was constituted a Local Board of Health District in 1851, governed by a local board. In 1868 the Layton with Warbreck district was renamed the Blackpool district.

In 1876 the district was elevated to become a municipal borough, governed by a body formally called the &quot;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Blackpool&quot;, but generally known as the corporation or town council. The borough was enlarged several times, notably in 1879, when it took in parts of the neighbouring parishes of Marton and Bispham with Norbreck, in 1918, when it absorbed the rest of Bispham with Norbreck, and in 1934, when it absorbed the rest of Marton.

In 1904 Blackpool was made a county borough, taking over county-level functions from Lancashire County Council. This was reverted in 1974 when Blackpool became a lower-tier non-metropolitan district with the county council once more providing services in the town. Blackpool regained its independence from the county council in 1998 when it was made a unitary authority.

Blackpool remains part of the ceremonial county of Lancashire for the purposes of lieutenancy.

===Parliamentary constituencies===
Blackpool is covered by two Westminster constituencies: 
* Blackpool North and Fleetwood 
* Blackpool South
Until 1945, the area was represented by just one constituency, named Blackpool. This was replaced by the new Blackpool North and Blackpool South constituencies. Blackpool North became Blackpool North and Cleveleys for the 2010 general election, when Conservative Paul Maynard became MP. Another Conservative, Scott Benton, won Blackpool South from longstanding Labour MP Gordon Marsden in 2019. Benton resigned on 25 March 2024, however, after the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards investigated a fake lobbying role he was offered by undercover reporters from &quot;The Times&quot;.

The constituencies were reorganised for the 2024 general election, following recommendations from the Boundary Commission for England that aim to make the number of voters in the country&#x27;s seats more equal. Blackpool South was expanded to take in new wards near the north of the constituency. The Blackpool North and Cleveleys constituency incorporated Fleetwood and five wards from the Blackpool Council area, and was renamed Blackpool North and Fleetwood – as a similar seat was known between 1997 and 2010. In 2022 Maynard told the &quot;Blackpool Gazette&quot;: &quot;I am sure that residents of Fleetwood will be glad to be reunited with the rest of the Fylde coast, as they are geographically.&quot;

==Economy==
As a local authority area, Blackpool&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) was approximately £3.2 billion in 2020 – 0.2 per cent of the English economy. GDP fell by 2.2 per cent between 2019 and 2020.

Seventy-five per cent of people of working age in Blackpool were economically active in 2021, with 51,600 in full-time employment and 7,900 self-employed. The average for the North West is 72.9 per cent and for England is 74.8 per cent.

Twenty-five per cent of jobs were in human health and social work – compared with 13.6 per cent nationally. Reflecting Blackpool&#x27;s strong tourism industry, 10.9 per cent were in accommodation and food services. With aerospace company BAE situated in the wider area and the Civil Service one of its major employers, the proportion of people working in public administration, defence and compulsory social security is also higher than the national average – 12.5 per cent compared with 4.6 per cent.

In a survey of the UK&#x27;s 63 largest cities and towns – using primary urban areas, a measure of the built-up area rather than local authority boundaries – the think tank Centre for Cities said Blackpool&#x27;s gross value added (GVA) was £5.2 billion in 2020, with GVA per hour of £32.7. That placed it at 53rd and 40th place in the survey respectively. It was also in the lower half of the rankings for business start-ups, closures and overall stock, as well as the proportion of new economy firms.

Blackpool is the third lowest local authority area in the UK for gross median weekly pay. Its growth rates were forecast to be among the lowest localities in the UK Competitiveness Index 2023 - along with Blaenau Gwent (Wales), Burnley (North West), Torbay (South West), and Merthyr Tydfil (Wales).

Blackpool is also the main centre of the wider Fylde Coast sub-regional economy, containing other coastal towns, including Lytham, market towns, an agricultural hinterland and some industry. Polymers company Victrex, in Thornton and formerly part of ICI, is one of the major private sector companies headquartered in the area. Sports car manufacturer TVR was based in Blackpool until 2006, and national jewellery chain Beaverbrooks, founded in 1919, relocated its head office to St Annes in 1946.

Economic development officials highlight Blackpool&#x27;s role in industry sectors including aerospace and advanced engineering, advanced materials technologies, regional energy, and food manufacturing. As well as BAE, leading aerospace companies in the area include Magellan Aerospace and Force Technology. In advanced materials, AGC and Victrex are significant companies. In energy, nuclear fuel manufacturer Westinghouse, the National Nuclear Laboratory and offshore energy companies Orsted, NVH and Helispeed all have operations in the area. Blackpool&#x27;s travel to work area has 2.5 times the Great Britain-average concentration of food manufacturing workers.

=== Conferences and exhibitions ===
During the second half of the 20th century and up to 2007, Blackpool was one of the country&#x27;s leading locations for political conferences, with the three main parties as well as bodies such as the TUC holding events at the Winter Gardens.

With the Winter Gardens in need of refurbishment at the time and parties preferring inland city locations to coastal resorts, Blackpool held no major political conferences between 2008 and 2021. The Conservatives returned for their spring event in 2022 in the newly rebuilt Winter Gardens Conference and Exhibition Centre.

==Regeneration==
Like most UK coastal resorts, Blackpool declined from the 1960s onwards with the rise of overseas holidays. This coincided with a lack of investment in the town and its facilities for both residents and tourists.

Fulfilment of a 1965 masterplan to remodel the town centre was &quot;limited and piecemeal&quot;, according to Historic England. Ambitious plans to redevelop the centre &quot;stuttered to a halt in the early 1970s&quot;. Large numbers of homes were deemed unfit for human habitation and by 1993, almost 30 per cent of households did not have central heating, compared with the national average of 8.5 per cent. A new masterplan in 2003 was a response to this decline and the growing threat from coastal erosion. It was described by English Heritage as a &quot;bold attempt to ensure the future of the town&quot;.

Blackpool had looked at regeneration possibilities that would include an Atlantic City– or Las Vegas–style resort casino that Leisure Parcs, then owner of Blackpool Tower and the Winter Gardens, unveiled £1 billion plans for in 2002. By 2007, Blackpool and Greenwich in London were considered frontrunners among the seven bidders for Britain&#x27;s first and only supercasino licence; however, nearby Manchester won the bidding process. The Casino Advisory Panel ruled that the &quot;regeneration benefits of the supercasino for Blackpool are unproven and more limited geographically than other proposals&quot;. The government later abandoned the supercasino licence altogether following a legislative defeat in the House of Lords.
In response to Blackpool losing the supercasino bid and lobbying from the town&#x27;s disappointed leaders, ministers increased its regeneration spending, coordinated by an Urban Regeneration Company ReBlackpool, set up in 2005. Before being wound up in 2010, ReBlackpool led on Central Seafront, a £73 million coastal protection scheme that brought new promenades and seawalls for the town, funded by Government, the North West Development Agency and the European Regional Development Fund. ReBlackpool also prepared the Talbot Gateway scheme, appointing Muse Developments to develop 160,000 sq m of office and business space, as well as retail and hotel units, on a 10ha plot near Blackpool North Station. Blackpool Council agreed to relocate its offices to the development and there were plans for a new public transport interchange.

In 2010, Blackpool Council bought landmarks Blackpool Tower, the Winter Gardens and the Golden Mile Centre from leisure entrepreneur Trevor Hemmings, aiming to refurbish them in a &quot;last-ditch effort to arrest Blackpool&#x27;s economic decline&quot;. Public ownership enabled significant further investment in the facilities. The restoration of the Tower&#x27;s stained glass windows was carried out by local specialist Aaron Whiteside, who was given a Blackpool Council conservation award for the work.

Refurbishment of the Winter Gardens conference centre was completed in time to host the Conservative Party spring conference in 2022, with further work announced in 2023.

Blackpool Council was one of four local authorities in the Blackpool Fylde and Wyre Economic Development Company – the others being Lancashire County Council, Fylde Borough Council and Wyre Borough Council. It oversaw the development of the Blackpool Airport Development Zone, which came into existence in 2016. It offers tax breaks and simplified planning to employers.

Blackpool Council, once again owner of the airport since it acquired it from Balfour Beatty in 2017, is seeking outline planning consent to build five new hangars and a commercial unit. The masterplan for the Blackpool Airport Enterprise Zone then envisages a new digital and technology quarter called Silicon Sands.

In 2018, Blackpool Council announced plans for the 7-acre Blackpool Central development, on the site of Blackpool Central Station, which was closed in 1964. The council agreed to provide the land for the scheme – which had earlier been earmarked for the supercasino – but it was to be private-sector funded, led by developer Nikal. It aims to provide a new public square, hotels, restaurants, a food market and car park.

===Talbot Gateway===

The first phase of Talbot Gateway was completed in 2014 with the opening of the Number One Bickerstaffe Square council office, a supermarket and a refurbished multi-storey car park, and public spaces.

Phase two, including a new Holiday Inn and a tram terminal for the extended tramway between North Pier and North Station, began in 2021 and was due to be completed by 2022 but was delayed and it opened in May 2024. But new ground floor retail units were released in July 2023.

Construction started in February 2023 on new government offices as part of phase three of Talbot Gateway, and 3,000 Department for Work and Pensions staff are due to be relocated to the town after an expected completion date of March 2025.

In January 2023, Blackpool and Wyre councils were awarded £40 million from the government&#x27;s Levelling-Up Fund for a new education campus as part of phase four of Talbot Gateway. The campus will provide a new carbon-neutral base for Blackpool and The Fylde College. This will involve &quot;relocating&quot; the existing Park Road campus which is considered to present challenges including dated infrastructure. The future of the 1937 building on Palatine Road – designed by civic architect JC Robinson for Blackpool Technical College and School of Art – is unknown.

===Blackpool Central===
Plans for Blackpool Central&#x27;s multi-storey car park and Heritage Quarter were approved in October 2021, and construction of the car park began in 2022. But the £300 million development was stalled because of a lack of funding to move the Magistrates and County Courts from the site. In November 2022, Levelling-Up Secretary Michael Gove said his department would award £40 million of funding to enable that relocation and &quot;revitalise this great town by delivering much-needed homes, more jobs and new opportunities for local people&quot;.

===Heritage Action Zone===
The Blackpool Heritage Action Zone (HAZ) aims to bring new uses to the town centre by restoring buildings and promoting creative activities. Blackpool is one of more than 60 locations in the UK to have Heritage Action Zones, and its initial funding of £532,575 was secured in 2020.

Restoration of buildings is taking place on Topping Street, Edward Street and Deansgate, while the largest part of the scheme is the Church Street frontage of the Winter Gardens. The Art Deco building of 28 Topping Street has become a community creative hub run by Aunty Social, a voluntary arts organisation focussing on socially engaged work in gentle spaces and directed by Catherine Mugonyi and a building on Edward Street is to be converted into live/work for local artists and creatives.

Abingdon Street Market was partially reopened to the public in May 2023 after a three-year closure due to urgent maintenance works. The Edward Street side of the market was redesigned as a food hall and space for live entertainment and community events. The retail side of the market – located via the Abingdon Street entrance – was due to open in Winter 2023. The market was purchased by the council with £3.6 million of government funding through the Getting Building Fund. Renovations were funded with further government money – £315,000 from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund and £90,000 from the HAZ. The market is operated by Little Blackpool Leisure which comprises local directors.

The HAZ cultural programme has included artist-led workshops and activities, and pop up creative markets.

=== Art ===
The Grundy Art Gallery on Queen Street opened in 1911 and adjoins Blackpool Central Library.

Blackpool Art Society was formed in 1884 by George Dearden as Blackpool Sketching Club. The first exhibition was at the YMCA Rooms in Church Street. In 1886 the club hosted an exhibition of 226 exhibits in the Victoria Street schoolrooms. The Grundy brothers were prominent members, and in 1913 the society was granted the use of the new Grundy Art Gallery for its annual exhibition, where it still exhibits today. Grundy art gallery includes the work &quot;Blackpool Stands Between Us and Revolution2, which was displayed temporarily outside on the roof of the gallery in 2022 before moving inside. It is an illuminated text-based artwork by Tom Ireland that is based on a quote by a local businessman to architect Thomas H Mawson in the 1920s to explain the town&#x27;s importance to working-class people.

Blackpool School of Arts, part of Blackpool and The Fylde College, opened in 1937 on Park Road in a building designed by civic architect JC Robinson. The building houses a gallery space which hosts a range of exhibitions. Alumni visual artists include Jeffrey Hammond, Adrian Wilson, Sarah Myerscough and Craig McDean. Plans for a new town centre &#x27;multiversity&#x27; are set to replace the current Park Road campus in 2026.

Established in 2011 and named after its former use for the production of Blackpool rock, the Old Rock Factory consists of studios housing printmakers and other artists in Blackpool. Residents include printmaker and painter Suzanne Pinder and its founder, screen printer Robin Ross who brought the building back into use. Ross, a former radio DJ, also founded &quot;Sand, Sea and Spray&quot; street art festival. Running between 2011 and 2016, the festival featured live street art by international artist produced on walls and billboards in various locations throughout central Blackpool.

Opened in 2014, Abingdon Studios is a contemporary visual art project space and artist studios curated and directed by Garth Gratrix, who champions working-class and queer artists. In 2021 he and artist Harry Clayton-Wright produced &quot;We&#x27;re Still Here&quot;, the first permanent collection of LGBTQIA+ heritage in Blackpool, supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.

Co-founder and directed by local artists, HIVEArts is a gallery space and grassroots arts collective that hosts regular exhibitions. Exhibitions have included &quot;The Art Of Forgery&quot; by Peter Sinclair (2022), the Gallery Space open exhibition (2022) and &quot;The Air That A Breathe&quot;, a group exhibition raising money for the Aspergillosis Trust (2023). In 2022 the gallery hosted an art auction of 250 original paintings, photos and sculptures donated by local artists raising £8,000+to help victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Tea Amantes is a tearoom and gallery established in 2021 which hosts monthly art exhibitions by local emerging artists. Exhibitions have included &quot;The Main Resort&quot;, featuring Blackpool street photography, and &quot;Golden Energies&quot; by Katarzyna Nowak.

==== Left Coast ====
Left Coast is an arts organisation that was established in 2013, as part of the UK Creative People and Places Programme to produce socially-engaged creative and cultural activities in Blackpool and Wyre. Left Coast projects have included a National Community Lottery funded &quot;Real Estates&quot; programme in which artists were given residencies on local housing association estates to test whether they could become embedded in the community rather than being seen as visitors. An independent evaluation by the University of Central Lancashire stated that the project &quot;made a real difference to local communities through the use of arts as a catalyst for the development of a sense of confidence and self-worth, developing or rediscovering skills, and increasing social connections.&quot;

In response to a November 2017 &quot;Financial Times&quot; article &quot;Left Behind: Can anyone save the towns the economy forgot?,&quot; Left Coast commissioned a series of artists to provide &quot;a nuanced and thoughtful counter position&quot;. Photographer Craig Easton photographed the Williams family who he had first met in 1992 for a commission by French newspaper Libération to document the British &#x27;underclass&#x27;. His images of the Williams&#x27;s, titled &quot;Thatcher&#x27;s Children,&quot; &quot;came to symbolise the deprivation that was a legacy of the Conservative government of the day&quot;&quot;.&quot; Revisiting them for Left Coast, Easton created a project entitled &quot;Is Anybody Listening?.&quot;

Left Coast helped raise finance for the Art B&amp;B project which opened in 2019. Among the 18 different themed rooms were The &quot;Now You See it, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot; suite created by artist and writer professor Tim Etchells, and the &quot;Willy Little&quot; suite by artist Mel Brimfield, which celebrated the career of a fictional entertainer and his performances at The Ocean Hotel – the original name of Art B&amp;B. The B&amp;B closed in October 2022 claiming there were not enough future bookings to sustain the business.

In 2022, Left Coast opened &quot;Wash Your Words: Langdale Library &amp; Laundry Room&quot; on social housing estate Mereside. It provides somewhere for people to wash clothes, read, learn and create art. In January 2023 it was nominated for the RIBA Journal MacEwen Award, celebrating architecture for the common good. Judges praised its &quot;joyful design [that] raises expectations of the quality of architecture people should demand of social housing estates&quot;.

==== Aunty Social ====
Established in 2011, Aunty Social is a voluntary-run community arts organisation in Topping Street. In 2013 it registered as a Community interest company (CIC) and opened Charabanc, a shop selling products made by local artists and designers. Aunty Social runs the online arts and culture magazine Blackpool Social Club, the Winter Gardens Film Festival and BFI Film Club. Facilities include a community darkroom and library. A Queer Craft Club and Heritage Craft workshops are hosted.

Local textiles group Knittaz With Attitude is an Aunty Social project which has carried out several yarn bombing projects in public spaces. In 2022 the group responded to reports of sexual harassment recorded by Reclaim Blackpool which maps incidents that take place in public places. Over 20 participants created craftivist works highlighting the precarious safety of women and using methods including cross stitch, crochet, appliqué and embroidery under the banner &quot;We&#x27;re Sew Done&quot;. The pieces were placed in locations plotted on the map before being exhibited in Blackpool Central Library. The exhibition featured in local singer Rae Morris&#x27;s video for her single No Woman Is An Island.

==== Public art ====
=== Performing arts ===
==== Theatre ====

At its peak in the 1930s Blackpool&#x27;s numerous theatres and cinemas could seat more than 60,000 people.

The Theatre Royal on Clifton Street first opened as the Assembly Rooms and Arcade in 1868. It later became the Tivoli Electric Theatre and eventually Yates&#x27;s Wine Lodge before it was destroyed by fire in 2009.

In 1874 the Indian Pavilion was built on North Pier to host regular concert performances. After being damaged by fire in 1921 and destroyed by another in 1938 it was replaced by the Art Deco Pavilion Theatre (now the Joe Longthorne Theatre) in 1939. One of few remaining pier theatres in the country, it hosts variety acts during the summer season. The theatre is Grade II listed but has been on the Theatres At Risk Register since 2014.

The Borough Theatre (later Queens Theatre) opened in September 1877 on Bank Hey Street. A blue Plaque marks the location of the building which was demolished in 1972/73.

Her Majesty&#x27;s Opera House, part of the Winter Gardens complex&quot;,&quot; was built in 1889 and designed by architect Frank Matcham. The 2,500 capacity was soon deemed insufficient and was redesigned by architects Mangnall and Littlewood in 1910. In October 1938 the old Opera House was demolished and the third and current Opera House, with a classic Art Deco design, replaced it. Seating 3,000, it was the largest theatre in the country when it opened. The first Royal Variety Performance to be held outside London was staged there in 1955. The Opera House is one of only three remaining historic theatres in Blackpool still in operation, regularly staging touring musicals.

The Empire Theatre and Opera House on Church Street opened in 1895 and by 1900 it had been converted into a circus venue and renamed Hippodrome. In 1929 it became the ABC cinema but continued to host stage shows, including in the 1960s TV variety show Blackpool Night Out in which the Beatles appeared on 19 July 1964. The theatre became The Syndicate superclub in 2002 until it was demolished in 2014.

The Prince of Wales Theatre was built in 1879 next to the site of Blackpool Tower. It was replaced in 1900 with the grand Alhambra complex but, unable to compete with the neighbouring Tower hit financial difficulties in 1902. Architect Frank Matcham remodelled the building and it became the Palace Theatre in 1904. It was demolished in 1961.

The Grand Theatre was built in 1894 and dubbed Frank Matcham&#x27;s masterpiece. It hosts a mix of local, mainstream and high brow performances as well as an annual pantomime. In the 1990s the theatre was annexed to provided a Studio Theatre. Supported by the Friends of the Grand Theatre, it is a registered charity and in 2022 received Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation status – a three-year investment of more than £1.5m. In September 2023 Blackpool Council committed £500,000 to carry out urgent repairs to the theatre. The Grand has had a youth theatre company since 1996 and has partnered with the Royal Shakespeare Company to engage school children with theatre and performance.

The Regent Cinema, built in Neo-Baroque style, opened in 1921. From the 1970s it was a bingo hall; after renovation in the 2010s it re-opened as a cinema and venue for live performances.

The Old Electric is Blackpool&#x27;s newest theatre, opening in 2021 on Springfield Road in the former Princess Electric Cinema. Founded by creative director Melanie Whitehead, it became the home of The Electric Sunshine Project CIC, a community theatre company she established in 2016, as well as a community arts space. The renovation of the building, which had been a string of nightclubs prior, was National Lottery funded and carried out during lockdown.

==== Dance ====

Dance has been central to Blackpool culture for 150 years. One of the first places visitors could dance was on the open air on the piers and its popularity led to ballrooms opening across the town. The Tower Ballroom came first in 1894, quickly followed by the Empress Ballroom and the Alhambra.

The original Tower Ballroom was a smaller pavilion but the facility posed a threat to the Winter Gardens whose management responded in 1896 by improving its facilities. The Empress Ballroom – much grander and larger than its rival – was built on the site of a roller rink and designed by Mangnall and Littlewood with a capacity of 3,000. Towards the end of the First World War, in 1918, the Empress Ballroom was taken over by the Admiralty as a space to assemble Gas Envelopes for their R33 Airship. Renovations in 1934 included a new sprung dance floor with 10,000 strips of oak, mahogany, walnut, and greenwood, on top of 1,320 four inch springs, covering 12,500 foot.

The first Blackpool Dance Festival was held in the Empress Ballroom during Easter week in 1920. The idea is credited to either Harry Wood, the musical director of the Winter Gardens, or Nelson Sharples, a music publisher in Blackpool. The festival was devoted to three competitions to find three new sequence dances in three tempos – waltz, two step and foxtrot. There was one competition per day and, on the fourth, one dance was chosen as the winner. In 1931 the dance festival hosted the inaugural British Professional and Amateur Ballroom Championships and in 1953 the competitions included the North of England Amateur and Professional Championships, a Ballroom Formation Dancing Competition, the British Amateur and Professional Ballroom Championships, plus a Professional Exhibition Dancing Competition. In 1961, a British Amateur Latin American Tournament was held, followed by a Professional event in 1962. These two events were upgraded to Championship status in 1964. 1968 saw the introduction of the Professional Invitation Team Match and in 1975 the first British Closed Dance Festival was held – now the British National Championships. In modern times around 50 countries are represented across eight annual festivals in the Empress Ballroom and Blackpool Dance Festival is considered ‘the world&#x27;s first and foremost festival of dancing’.

The present Tower Ballroom was designed by Frank Matcham and opened in 1899 to rival the Empress Ballroom, matching its capacity of 3,000. Its sprung dance floor measures 120 feet by 102 feet and consists of 30,602 separate blocks of mahogany, oak and walnut. The inscription above the Ballroom stage, &#x27;Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear&#x27;, is from Shakespeare&#x27;s Venus and Adonis sonnet. Among the Ballroom&#x27;s one-time strict rules were &#x27;gentlemen may not dance unless with a lady&#x27; and &#x27;disorderly conduct means immediate expulsion&#x27;. Originally, dancing was not permitted on Sundays when an evening of sacred music was performed instead. In December 1956, the ballroom was badly damaged by fire and the dance floor was destroyed. It took two years and £500,000 to restore. The BBC series Come Dancing – aired between 1950 and 1998 – was broadcast from the Tower Ballroom and featured professional dancers competing against each other. Its reinvention as Strictly Come Dancing launched in 2004 and includes an annual Blackpool week, when the show is broadcast from the Tower Ballroom. The Tower Ballroom remains a popular venue for dancing and its celebrated Wurlitzer organ still rises from below the stage. In 2022 it featuring on the BBC&#x27;s interactive map of 100 Places for 100 Years of the BBC.

During the 20th century, ballroom bandleaders created new novelty dances including The Blackpool Walk, the dance craze of the 1938 summer season. The music was composed by Lawrence Wright, a prominent music publisher, under the pen name Horatio Nicholls, and choreographed by 1937 Blackpool Dance Festival Champions, Cyril Farmer and Adela Roscoe. Inspired by the Blackpool Walk, in 2020 local dance company House of Wingz created a new social dance, The Blackpool Way, as part of a community project called Get Dancing. Music was composed by Callum Harvey and dance steps and moves were submitted by people from across the world.

Based on Back Reeds Road, House of Wingz was founded by married couple Samantha and Aishley Docherty Bell. Using knowledge and education in hip hop culture, the company aims to create a legacy or &#x27;scene&#x27; for dance artists and musicians in Blackpool, who will contribute to a growing cultural landscape in the town. House of Wingz is the Blackpool partner for Breakin&#x27; Convention, a festival celebrating the best in UK hip hop talent founded by pioneer Jonzi D. In 2022 members of House of Wingz collected seven trophies in the UDO World Street Dance Championships including two first place prizes. Although dance is at the heart of House of Wingz, it is also home to a collective of musicians, artists and performers who stage their own productions and collaborate on creative projects. Skool of Street is House of Wingz&#x27; charitable arm, providing free access to classes for children who do not have the means to pay as well as delivering the Government&#x27;s Holiday Activities and Food programme.

Other dance schools in Blackpool include Phil Winstone&#x27;s Theatreworks, Whittaker Dance &amp; Drama Centre and Langley Dance Centre.

==== Amateur dramatics ====
There are a number of notable amateur and community theatre companies in Blackpool.

Junction Four Productions, formed in 1904 as Lytham Amateur Operatic Society (LAOS), is one of the original musical theatre groups on the Fylde Coast. A registered charity, it changed its name in 2018 to reflect its varied canon. Blackpool &amp; Fylde Light Opera Company (BFLOC) is an amateur musical comedy society that has hosted annual productions since 1950.  Blackpool Operatic Players (BOP) has been presenting musical theatre productions in Blackpool and the surrounding areas since 1953.

On 14 January 2022, a blue plaque was unveiled on Michael Hall Theatre School (formerly Marton Parish Church Hall) on Preston New Road recording that, from 1930 to 2002, Marton Operatic Society performed Gilbert and Sullivan and other operas there. Founded as Marton Parish Church Choral and Operatic Society in 1930 by Reverend Charles Macready and William Hogarth, their first production was Cupid and the Ogre. In 2021, following a decline exacerbated by COVID-19, members voted to wind the society up. A final concert version of The Mikado was held on 29 October.

Michael Hall Theatre School is a small theatre space and school in the former Marton Parish Church Hall. Founded in 2003, it is run by Michael Hall who studied at the Royal Academy of Music and whose past pupils include Jodie Prenger and Aiden Grimshaw. Hall also runs Musica Lirica Opera Company which aims to make opera accessible.

Founded in 2005, TramShed is an inclusive theatre company and charity offering inclusive performing arts to all children, young people and adults many of whom have additional needs. In 2021 it was named a National Diversity Awards finalist. Cou-Cou Theatre Productions is a Community Interest Company founded in 2018 by sisters Sophie and Nikita Coulon.

==== Heritage ====
Blackpool has a rich musical heritage associated with its tourist industry alongside a number of popular music scenes and artists that have emerged there. The first registered venue offering musical entertainment in Blackpool was the original Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin, situated on the cliffs at North Shore, from the early 1860s.

The Wurlitzer organ at Blackpool Tower Ballroom was played by Reginald Dixon from March 1930 until March 1970, with live broadcasts of his performances being aired each week during the summer season on the BBC Light Programme. Phil Kalsall has been principle organist at the venue since 1977.

Lawrence Wright was a successful music publisher and songwriter who moved to Blackpool in the 1920s and opened 20 song booths, hiring musicians to play his sheet music inside which passers-by would purchase after entering to listen and sing along.

Blackpool was instrumental in the music of big bands who performed jazz and swing music in its dancehalls and ballrooms from the 1930s-1950s. Frequent performers from 1946 to 1959 were Ted Heath, Joe Loss and Jack Parnell.

In the post-war period Blackpool was the centre of live entertainment outside London and there was a proliferation of musical talent coming from and discovered in the town. The town hosted three or four variety shows per night during tourist seasons, each featuring popular music including The Shadows, Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck and American stars including Frank Sinatra who performed twice in the early 1950s.

The heyday of Blackpool&#x27;s musical history to date and the golden era was the 1960s when live music was offered in the town&#x27;s many pubs, clubs, theatres and concert venues to accommodate its millions of visitors. All the top British beat groups played in Blackpool, forging a tradition at the Winter Gardens Empress Ballroom of staging of rock, alternative and indie music with visiting bands through the decades including Queen, the Stone Roses, Blur and New Order.

Smaller music venues of note include The Galleon bar on Adelaide Street which opened in 1954 and was a magnet for musicians and Mama &amp; Papa Jenks on Talbot Road, which attracted emerging acts of the 1970s including the Eurythmics and the Buzzcocks and evolved into a punk music venue hosting bands such as the Fits and the Membranes.

John Lennon spent a short time living in Blackpool as a child and would often visit family there and watch musical acts including George Formby and Dickie Valentine. The Beatles were booked to perform on South Pier throughout the summer of 1962 but their fame saw them outgrow the venue before they could fulfil their residency. They did go on to play a series of dates in the ABC Theatre and later the Opera House in August 1963 and 1964.

The Rolling Stones gig at the Empress Ballroom on 24 July 1964 resulted in a riot. The venue was left badly damaged, with fans smashing two chandeliers, tearing up seats and breaking a Steinway grand piano. Two people were hospitalised and around 50 treated for minor injuries. Blackpool Council banned the Rolling Stones from performing in the town again, lifting the ban 44 years later, although the band is yet to return.

Jimi Hendrix supported Cat Stevens at the Odeon complex on 15 April 1967. There are claims Hendrix was refused entry to his hotel after the show due to intoxication. Pink Floyd played the Empress Ballroom a month later, on 26 May 1967. Hendrix and Pink Floyd both returned later that year to perform on the same bill at Blackpool Opera House on 25 November 1967. Pink Floyd returned to Blackpool on 21 March 1969 to play the Blackpool Technical College Arts Ball on 21 March 1969.

Factory Records&#x27; Section 25 formed in Blackpool in 1977. Their key recordings include the US crossover club hit &quot;Looking Form a Hilltop&quot; and the album &quot;From the Hi&quot;p. Another Blackpool band signed to the label was Tunnelvision, who recorded just one single for the label in 1981.

==== Inspired by Blackpool ====
The large number of musical artists connected to Blackpool exceeds that of the town&#x27;s comparable size and include the band Boston Manor, Chris Lowe, Graham Nash, John Evan, Victoria Hesketh, John Robb, Jon Gomm, Karima Francis, Rae Morris, Robert Smith and Section 25. With the exception of grime artists, however, their hometown hardly features in the work of these artists and we never heard about ‘Blackpool sound’, as opposed to the Mersey Sound or Madchester.

Blackpool has been referenced within popular music for the best part of a century. Stanley Holloway’s 1932 comic song &quot;The Lion and Albert&quot; tells the story of a small child being eaten by a lion at Blackpool Zoo and George Formby, one of the town&#x27;s most successful regular performers in the 1930s and ‘40s, penned songs including &quot;Blackpool Prom&quot;, &quot;Sitting on the Top of Blackpool Tower&quot; and &quot;With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock&quot;. The George Formby Society formed at the Imperial Hotel with 56 members a few months after Formby&#x27;s death in 1961. Now consisting of over 800 members worldwide, many return to the same hotel quarterly to for society conventions.

In the latter part of the 20th century songs inspired by Blackpool included, Blur&#x27;s &quot;This Is a Low&quot;, Soft Cell&#x27;s &quot;Say Hello, Wave Goodbye&quot;, Manic Street Preachers&#x27; &quot;Elvis Impersonator, Blackpool Pier&quot; and The Kinks&#x27; &quot;Autumn Almanac&quot;, which has been called ‘the most British song of all time’.

&quot;Up The Pool&quot; by Jethro Tull, who formed as a blues-based rock band in the Blackpool in the late 1960s, was released in 1971. It differs from the band&#x27;s other musical output at the time with frontman Ian Anderson, who lived in Blackpool, choosing to reflect national identity both lyrically and musically in a conscious rejection of the American music that influenced so many other British bands of the era. In &quot;Blackpool Tower Suite&quot;, Manchester indie band World of Twist present a personification of the Tower almost as a female deity presiding over the pleasure grounds of Blackpool.

Blackpool-born singer Rae Morris’s 2022 album &quot;Rachel@Fairyland&quot; pays homage to her hometown with songs referencing Blackpool Tower, childhood memories, the town&#x27;s LGBTQ+ community and its deprivation. Music videos for singles &quot;No Woman Is An Island&quot; and &quot;Go Dancing&quot; were shot in Blackpool, as was the video for her 2021 standalone single &quot;Fish n Chips&quot;, featuring grime artist Sophie Aspin.

Many songs about Blackpool reflect its position as a popular holiday destination for the working classes. Folk singer Howard Broadbent&#x27;s 1983 song &quot;Blackpool Belle&quot; was rerecorded by Bolton folk trio the Houghton Weavers in 1993 and, like the song &quot;Blackpool&quot; by indie band the Delgados, speaks of happy memories of bygone days and of the sense of comradeship. Meanwhile, &quot;Tatty Seaside Town&quot; by punk band The Membranes, who formed in Blackpool in the 1970s, reflects the experience of young men growing up there. The Fall, in their 2003 song &quot;Idiot Joy Showland&quot;, reflect on the town&#x27;s artifice while Macclesfield-based punk band the Macc Lads, in their 1985 song &quot;Blackpool&quot;, boasts of outrageous and offensive behaviour reflective of the idea of that the town is a place to shed inhibitions.

Recurring motifs in songs about Blackpool include the idea that Blackpool is an important part of English identity, the distance between the glittering surface and a grimier reality of the town, and of Blackpool as a place of freedom and relative sexual freedom, as embodied by the Kiss Me Quick hat or &quot;saucy postcard&quot;. While depictions of Blackpool in popular music represent a wide range of attitudes to the town, their connection to the English working-class is inevitably a persistent seam running through them.

==== Scenes ====
Blackpool has played a significant role in music scenes including northern soul, punk, rave and grime.

Locarno Mecca opened on Central Drive in April 1965 attracting acts including Slade (1972), Bob Marley and the Wailers (22 November 1973) and Martha and the Vandellas (25 February 1977). The venue went on to become home to one of four legendary northern soul nights in the Highland Room, established in 1970 by local DJ, Tony Jebb along with Les Cokell, followed by Ian Levine and Colin Curtis. At the end of the 1970s it was renamed Tiffany&#x27;s and later the Rhythm Dome, home to Federation – influential in the 1990s house and rave scene. It was demolished in 2009. Blackpool retains a strong connection to northern soul with major weekender events still taking place in the town at both the Blackpool Tower and the Winter Gardens. The town also remains a frequent destination for soul weekenders, which were popular during the jazz-funk era of the mid-1980s.

Blackpool&#x27;s embracing of punk in the 1970s and the subsequent middle-class reaction to it has been likened to the anxieties of the middle classes during the influx of working-class visitors arriving via the railway system to Blackpool with in Victorian times. Blackpool&#x27;s connection with punk is also said to reflect and gains its strength from Blackpool&#x27;s poor life prospects in terms of employment, recreational drug use, health, housing and antisocial behaviour.

Blackpool was not initially at the forefront of the punk revolution, with its youth culture still preoccupied by northern soul throughout the ‘70s, and became more well known for its homegrown post-punk groups, The Membranes, The Fits, Section 25 and the Ceramic Hobbs. But punk has held on well in Blackpool which has hosted the annual Rebellion Festival since 1996, attracting international visitors and claiming to be the largest independent punk music festival in the world. Its line up regularly includes many major bands from the heyday of punk. Sham 69, who played the festival in 1996, celebrated the event and its promotion of the punk values of acceptance and solidarity with their song &quot;Blackpool&quot;, released the following year.

In the mid-2010s a number of mostly school-aged MCs began to showcase themselves on YouTube channels including Blackpool Grime Media (BGMedia). The aggressive and unapologetic branch of rap resonated with disaffected young people in Blackpool. Artists on BGMedia, including Afghan Dan, Little T, Millie B and Sophie Aspin, became the subject of a 2016 Vice documentary &quot;Noisey Blackpool: The Controversial Rise of Blackpool Grime&quot;, followed by 2017&#x27;s &quot;Noisey Blackpool 2: One Year On&quot;. And in October 2019 Channel 4 aired &quot;It&#x27;s Grime Up North&quot;, a documentary criticised for its &quot;sneering derision&quot; of children as young as 12 growing up in challenging circumstances. Meanwhile, Blackpool grime&#x27;s amateur approach was not taken seriously by music industry gatekeepers. Millie B&#x27;s 2016 track &quot;M to the B&quot; is a viral song that sparked a ‘chav-make-up’ trend on TikTok. The song ‘sends’ for Aspin as the pair were pitted against each other although the pair are now friends. Aspin claims that at the time she was exploited and incentivised with drugs to perform. Hip hop collective House of Wingz has gone on to work with Sophie Aspin and Millie B, teaming them up with Grammy-nominated producer Nat Powers.

Alongside the Empress Ballroom, which continues to host large touring bands, there are two independent music venues in Blackpool. Opened in 2014, Bootleg Social has established itself as a regular fixture for nationally touring bands and provides a platform for local musicians. The Waterloo Music Bar is a popular independent music venue, regularly hosting local and touring bands with a focus on the punk, rock and metal genres, since its reinvention in 2015. In Good Company is a grassroots music collective in Blackpool that seeks out and nurtures musicians from across the Fylde Coast and provides them with regular gigs across the town&#x27;s venues.

=== Film ===
The resort is featured in the 1934 film &quot;Sing as We Go&quot;, starring Gracie Fields, as well as other cinema and TV productions, including &quot;Forbidden&quot; (1949), &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot; (1952), &quot;Holiday&quot; (1957), &quot;Coasting&quot; (1990), &quot;Funny Bones&quot; (1995) starring Lee Evans and Oliver Platt and directed by St. Annes born Peter Chelsom, and &quot;The Parole Officer&quot; (2001) starring Steve Coogan.

In the Hollywood remake of the film (2004), directed by Peter Chelsom, Blackpool is mentioned but not shown.

Blackpool is the setting for &quot;Bhaji on the Beach&quot; (1993) directed by Gurinder Chadha. The film &quot;Like It Is&quot; (1998) directed by Paul Oremland was also partly filmed in Blackpool. The opening scenes were filmed in the Flamingo. The 2005 television comedy/thriller series &quot;Funland&quot; revolved around the fictionalised, seedier aspects of Blackpool.

The town also features heavily in the BBC television serial &quot;Blackpool&quot;, starring David Morrissey, Sarah Parish and David Tennant and first broadcast in 2004, and the one-off follow-up &quot;Viva Blackpool&quot;, broadcast in June 2006.

In 2006 Lion Television filmed &quot;The Great British Summer&quot;, which featured many buildings in Blackpool. The Royal Windsor Hotel was featured, with the owner talking all about the hotel seasons and industry. Bernard Manning was also shown at the hotel doing his spot through the season hosted by Blackpool Born local Entertainer &amp; DJ Gordon Head and other local acts. &quot;The Great British Summer&quot; was narrated by Alan Titchmarsh.

===LGBTQ+===

Blackpool had its first gay pride celebration in 2006. Historically, seaside resorts have been able to provide niches for minority groups. Blackpool, like other English resorts, has had a reputation for being a safe community for gay people. During World War II, there was a proliferation of cafés, pubs and clubs where homosexual men could meet in Blackpool. In the 1990s, the town began to be promoted as a gay tourist destination. Blackpool contains several bars, pubs and nightclubs aimed at the LGBTQ+ community. These include Funny Girls (a burlesque cabaret showbar), Flamingo and the Flying Handbag. As of the 2021 census, 3.26% of Blackpool residents aged over 16 identified as gay men or lesbians – this is the twelfth highest proportion among the 331 local authorities in England and Wales.

In 2022, We&#x27;re Still Here – an oral histories project supported by Heritage Lottery Fund was established by queer-led arts organisation Abingdon Studios and artists Garth Gratrix and Harry Clayton-Wright. Blackpool Pride has seen an arts and heritage strand as well as an international art project that aimed to raise awareness of sites of homophobic attack or insult reclaimed as sites beauty.

In October 2023 Blackpool Council launched a public survey to gather views on its vision to build on the strength of the high concentration of gay venues in the north of the town centre to create an area celebrating the resort&#x27;s LGBTQ+ heritage.

=== Twin towns/sister cities ===
Blackpool is twinned with Bottrop, Germany and Sanya, China.

==Sport==
Blackpool has two main venues for boxing fight nights, the Tower Circus Arena and the Winter Gardens, which both hold regular fight nights throughout the year. Events at these venues have been screened on Sky Sports, British Eurosport and Channel M. Blackpool is home to many current and former professional boxers, including Brian Rose, Jack Arnfield, Jeff Thomas, Mathew Ellis, Matty Askin and Scott Cardle.

Blackpool Cricket Club is Blackpool&#x27;s major cricketing team, playing in the Northern Premier Cricket League, formerly the Northern Cricket League. It has won the league 18 times (once jointly with Preston), making it the most successful side in the competition. Established in 1893, the club&#x27;s home is in the grounds of Stanley Park, which also hosts Lancashire County Cricket Club.

The annual Blackpool Marathon is staged on the Promenade each April. Thousands of competitors run on the closed Promenade, organised by Fylde Coast Runners.

===Football and rugby===

The town&#x27;s professional football club is Blackpool F.C., who have spent 31 seasons in the top division and won the 1953 FA Cup Final. Former Blackpool players include Sir Stanley Matthews, Jimmy Armfield and Roy Gratrix. There are other, smaller football clubs located within Blackpool, including A.F.C. Blackpool, Blackpool Wren Rovers and Squires Gate.

Blackpool Borough were the first professional rugby league club in the town. However, they eventually folded after leaving the town in 1987. Blackpool Panthers were formed in 2004 and played in Co-operative Championship One. They ground-shared at Bloomfield Road then in 2007 at Woodlands Memorial Ground, the home of Fylde Rugby Club in the neighbouring town of Lytham St Annes. The club ceased to exist after the 2010 season due to lack of finance.

Blackpool Stanley, Blackpool Scorpions and Blackpool Sea Eagles are amateur rugby league clubs in the town.

The resort formerly held the now discontinued Northern Rail Cup Final at Bloomfield Road, a Rugby League knockout competition for all clubs outside of the Super League attracting many thousands of visitors.

Blackpool is currently home to the annual &#x27;Summer Bash&#x27; rugby league tournament held at Bloomfield Road, where an entire round of Championship matches are played in the town to showcase the sport.

Blackpool also has a rugby union club, called Blackpool RUFC. Their home ground is Norbreck Rugby Ground.

===Golf===
There are three golf clubs in Blackpool. Blackpool North Shore Golf Club opened in 1904, moving to its present site on Knowle Hill in 1927; the new course was designed by Harry Colt. In 1926, an Alister MacKenzie designed course opened within Stanley Park; it is home to Blackpool Park Golf Club. The newest addition is Herons&#x27; Reach Golf Resort, which was designed by Peter Allis and Clive Clark and opened in 1992. Blackpool Golf Club, which opened in 1894, was located in South Shore; it closed at the beginning of World War II, with the land subsequently becoming part of Blackpool Airport.

===Professional wrestling===
The Pleasure Beach&#x27;s Horseshoe Show Bar was home to professional wrestling events throughout the season, promoted by Bobby Baron. The bar shows were home to a &quot;wrestling booth&quot; where members of the public could challenge the wrestlers for cash prizes for each round they survived. These challenges would be taken by shooters, wrestlers skilled in the brutal submission holds of catch wrestling, which they could deploy to defend the prize money even against skilled amateur wrestlers. Booths such as these had been a foundation of the professional wrestling industry since the 19th century, and Baron&#x27;s booth is reputed to have been the last of its kind in the world.

Numerous renowned professional wrestlers worked as carnival shooters at the booth, including future WWE star William Regal; his tag team partner Robbie Brookside; Shak Khan, who runs a catch wrestling school in the area; Dave Duran (John Palin) and future women&#x27;s champion Klondyke Kate. The booth ended with Baron&#x27;s death in 1994, although other promoters have since held shows in the bar. Additionally, the Tower Circus was a frequent venue for wrestling shows. A photograph of noted wrestling villain Jack Pye in action at the circus was, for some time in the late 2000s, displayed by the entrance to the circus. The tradition was revived by All Star Wrestling when they promoted a summer season at the venue in 2008, and a similar summer season in 2012 at the Winter Gardens. The Tower Ballroom hosted one date of the six show live tour of the &quot;World of Sport Wrestling&quot; TV show in February 2019.

WWE held a tournament at the Empress Ballroom on 14 and 15 January 2017 to crown the inaugural WWE United Kingdom Champion. In attendance were Regal and Triple H, with the latter commenting to local journalists, &quot;Blackpool has this reputation. It&#x27;s easy to get to, a lot of people come here and when they come here they lose it and that&#x27;s what we wanted. I almost feel like there wasn&#x27;t really another choice.&quot; Tyler Bate won the inaugural tournament to become the first WWE United Kingdom Champion.

Several renowned wrestlers have invested in Blackpool. Kendo Nagasaki owns the Trades Hotel and KAOS Nightclub, Rex Strong (born Barry Shearman, 1942–2017) owned the Hadley Hotel, and Johnny Saint owned a block of holiday flats in the town. Shirley &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Crabtree worked as a lifeguard on Central Pier. He was reunited, on a 1979 edition of ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, with a woman whose life he had saved in the course of his duties.

The Blackpool Combat Club, a heel faction in All Elite Wrestling led by Regal, was named in honour of Blackpool.

=== Skateboarding ===
Ramp City is an indoor skatepark in Blackpool. It is made up of wooden ramps and consists of a large street, park and transition section. The park was home to a full pipe and kidney-shaped bowl but these were removed in 2016 to make way for a roller rink. It houses one of the UK&#x27;s biggest vert ramps (13 ft 3in) and hosts the UK Vert Series Seaside Sessions. In 2014, then number one UK female skater Lucy Adams named the park one of her favourites in England. Ramp City also contains a branch of independent skate shop, Big Woody&#x27;s, that first opened in Blackpool in June 2002. In 2020 the park began hosting girl&#x27;s only skate nights.

The Skate Like A Girl (SLAG) collective is a group of female skaters from Blackpool who aim to reclaim the derogatory language they claim can be used towards women in the sport and create safe and inclusive skating environments for women. It works closely with Reclaim Blackpool, a project mapping sexual harassment in public spaces in the town.

In May 2022, an all-concrete skatepark was built on Stanley Park in Blackpool following a community fundraising effort to replace an old run down skatepark.

Live Like Ralph is a charity celebrating the memory of local skater Ralph Roberts who died suddenly of Sarcoidosis in 2021. It aims to provide skateboards and equipment to young skaters and build and maintain skateparks. In 2023 it collaborated with another Blackpool charity, Skool of Street, to build a safe and supportive indoor skatepark called Ralph&#x27;s House at House of Wingz studio on Back Reeds Road.

Disorder is a 2021 short film by the ATB Collective highlighting hidden and well-known skate spots in Blackpool. Curb Culture is a skateboarding zine highlighting local skateboarding culture.

==Religion==
Blackpool has a number of Christian churches, including 18 Anglican and 10 Catholic churches. Other Christian groups in the town include Blackpool Baptist Tabernacle, Blackpool Christian Centre, Blackpool Community Church, Kings Christian Centre, Liberty Church, and New Life Community Church. The Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes is now redundant and is being converted into a community centre by the Historic Chapels Trust.

There were previously two synagogues in Blackpool for its Jewish population, now down to one. The Blackpool Reform Jewish Congregation caters to the Reform population and is located on Raikes Parade with a synagogue hall and classroom facilities, a purpose-built sanctuary hall and an assembly room. Blackpool United Hebrew Congregation was an Orthodox synagogue located on Leamington Road with a synagogue hall and community centre. The synagogue closed in May 2012 due to a declining Orthodox population, with the final rabbi David Braunold having retired in 2011. As of January 2022, the building which formerly housed the synagogue was awaiting new use.

There is a residential Buddhist Centre in North Shore called Keajra Kadampa Buddhist Centre which is a member of the New Kadampa Tradition. There are also two mosques for the Muslim population: the purpose-built Blackpool Central Mosque &amp; Islamic Community Centre is located on Revoe Street and provides prayer facilities while the Blackpool Islamic Community Centre (BICC) offers Islamic education.

Blackpool also has small communities of Baháʼís, Hindus, Jains, Mormons, and Sikhs. The Blackpool Faith Forum was established in 2001 in conjunction with Blackpool Council to provide interfaith dialogue between the various faith groups in the town, to raise awareness of the various faiths in the town and to promote a multifaith community. It is linked to the Interfaith Network of UK. In February 2007 a youth forum was established, Blackpool Faith Forum for Youth (BIFFY).

==Education==
As well as 29 state primary schools and eight state secondary schools, there is also a range of activities for children and young people in the town. Some of these are delivered by &quot;Blackpool Young People Services&quot; (a part of Blackpool Council).

==Transport==
===Air===
Blackpool Airport operated regular charter and scheduled flights throughout the UK and Europe. The airport is actually just over the borough boundary into Fylde Borough, although a proposal to reorganise Blackpool&#x27;s borders would see the airport incorporated into Blackpool Borough. This airport, formerly known as Blackpool Squires Gate Airport, is one of the oldest in the UK having hosted public flying meetings in 1909 and 1910. After a gap, it was active from the 1930s to mid 2014 and from December 2014 to date. Airlines that served Blackpool, before its temporary closure in late 2014, included Jet2.com and Aer Arran. The airport was reopened to small aircraft after failing to find a buyer in December 2014 but flights ceased in 2017. Access to the town by air is now via Liverpool John Lennon Airport or Manchester Airport, both approximately away by road.

In 1927 the local council announced that an airfield would be built near Stanley Park, which would become Stanley Park Aerodrome offering flights to the Isle of Man for £1-16s–0d (£1.80). The airport opened in 1929 and was officially opened by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in 1931. However, with the opening of Squires Gate Airport a decision was announced in 1936 by the Ministry of Transport to close the Stanley Park airfield. In fact, civil operations continued until the outbreak of war with scheduled services to the Isle of Man and elsewhere. During the war, Stanley Park was used as a Royal Air Force (RAF) training station, known as No. 3 School of Technical Training. Vickers assembled many Wellington bombers here and Bristol Beaufighters were repaired for the RAF. The airfield closed in 1947. The land on which the airport stood now covers Blackpool Zoo and a hotel and golf course. The hangars from the old airport are still in use at Blackpool Zoo as the main entrance building, Playbarn, Education Academy and camel house.

===Bus and coach===

* Blackpool Transport operates the main bus services in and around Blackpool
* Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire operates the regional bus and coach services in and out of Blackpool
* National Express operates the main long-distance coach services in and out of Blackpool

Facilities include:
* Blackpool Talbot Road Bus Station, which was the main town centre bus station but is now a gym. Blackpool Transport stopped using the bus station in the early 2000s after a disagreement with Blackpool Council regarding the state of the bus station building. Blackpool Transport now use Market Street and Corporation Street, in the town centre, as their bus interchange. National Express have also recently stopped using this bus station, moving to the new National Express Blackpool Central Coach Station.
* Blackpool Central Coach Station is the main coach station for all National Express coach services. which is also used by some independent coach operators. The coach station has a booking office and toilet facilities.
* Blackpool Lonsdale Road Coach Station was the main coach station for South Shore district of Blackpool. This was mainly used by independent coach operators. The coach station has a café, shop and toilet facilities but is in a state of disrepair.
* Blackpool Colosseum Bus &amp; Coach Station, which was the main bus and coach station in South Shore. Located next to Blackpool Transport Headquarters, it was demolished to make way for a Somerfield supermarket. The site is now occupied by the link road from the M55 motorway and additional depot parking.

===Railway===
Train operators that serve Blackpool are:
* Avanti West Coast
* Northern Trains

Stations in the town are, or were:
* Blackpool North (originally Talbot Road)
* Blackpool Pleasure Beach (originally Burlington Road Halt)
* Blackpool South (originally Waterloo Road)
* Layton (originally Bispham)
* Squires Gate (just outside the borough boundary but serving Blackpool Airport)
* Blackpool Central (originally Hounds Hill, closed 1964)
* (renamed Lytham Road 1903, closed 1916)

Blackpool once had two railway terminals with a total of over 30 platforms, mainly used by excursion traffic in the summer. Blackpool Central, close to Blackpool Tower, was closed in 1964, while Blackpool North was largely demolished and rebuilt as a smaller facility. The route of the former excursion line into Blackpool Central is now used as a link road from the M55 motorway to the town centre. The line into Blackpool via Lytham St Annes now has a station serving Blackpool Pleasure Beach but terminates at Blackpool South station. The line into North station is now the more important.

===Road===
The M55 motorway links the town to the national motorway network. Other major roads in the town are the A583 to Kirkham and Preston, the A587 and A585 to Fleetwood, the A586 to Poulton-le-Fylde, Garstang and Lancaster and the A584 and B5261, which both lead to Lytham St Annes.

===Tram===

The Blackpool Tramway runs from Starr Gate in Blackpool to Fleetwood and is the only surviving first-generation tramway in the United Kingdom. The tramway dates back to 1885 and is one of the oldest electric tramways in the world. It is run by Blackpool Transport, owned by Blackpool Council. The tramway runs for and carries 6,500,000 passengers each year.

The tramway was for a long time the only working tramway in the United Kingdom outside of museums. It was also the UK&#x27;s first electric system. However, there are now a number of other tramways, including Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, Edinburgh Trams and West Midlands Metro.

On 1 February 2008 it was announced that the Government had agreed to a joint Blackpool Transport and Blackpool Council bid for funding toward the total upgrade of the track. The government contributed £60.3m of the total £85.3m cost. Blackpool Council and Lancashire County Council each provided about £12.5m. The Government&#x27;s decision meant that the entire length of the tramway from Starr Gate to Fleetwood was upgraded and also sixteen new trams joined the fleet.

In April 2012, the tramway reopened after the major reconstruction. Day to day services are run by the 16 Flexity 2 trams. Several double deck English Electric Balloon trams from the older fleet have been widened to work alongside the new trams to provide additional capacity in the summer months. Several non-modified older trams also operate a heritage service from Pleasure Beach to Little Bispham on weekends and holidays with a slight upcharge.

An extension of the new service to Blackpool North railway station was planned to open by April 2019, between the existing North Pier stop of the Blackpool Tramway, along Talbot Road, and terminating at Blackpool North railway station. This was delayed and in September 2021 was rescheduled to open in Summer 2022.

<doc id="232904" wikidata="Q1029620" url="?curid=232904" title="Coir">
<text>Coir (), also called coconut fibre, is a natural fibre extracted from the outer husk of coconut, and used in products such as floor mats, doormats, brushes, and mattresses. Coir is the fibrous material found between the hard, internal shell and the outer coat of a coconut. Other uses of brown coir (made from ripe coconut) are in upholstery padding, sacking and horticulture. White coir, harvested from unripe coconuts, is used for making finer brushes, string, rope and fishing nets. It has the advantage of not sinking, so can be used in long lengths in deep water without the added weight dragging down boats and buoys.

Coir must not be confused with coir [[pith]], which is the powdery and spongy material resulting from the processing of the coir fibre. Coir fibre is locally named &#x27;coprah&#x27; in some countries, adding to confusion. Pith is chemically similar to coir, but contains much shorter fibers. The name coco peat may refer either to coir or the pith or a mixture, as both have good water-retaining properties as a substitute for peat.

==History==
The name &quot;coir&quot; comes from கயிறு (&quot;kayiru&quot;), കയർ (&quot;kayar&quot;), the Tamil and Malayalam words respectively for cord or rope (traditionally, a kind of rope is made from the coconut fibre). Ropes and cordage have been made from coconut fibre since ancient times. The Austronesian peoples, who first domesticated coconuts, used coconut fibre extensively for ropes and sennit in building houses and lashed-lug plank boats in their voyages in both the Pacific and the Indian Oceans.

Later Indian and Arab navigators who sailed the seas to Malaya, China, and the Persian Gulf centuries ago also used coir for their ship ropes. Arab writers of the 11th century AD referred to the extensive use of coir for ship ropes and rigging.

A coir industry in the UK was recorded before the second half of the 19th century. During 1840, Captain Widely, in co-operation with Captain Logan and Thomas Treloar, founded the known carpet firms of Treloar and Sons in Ludgate Hill, England, for the manufacture of coir into various fabrics suitable for floor coverings.

==Structure==

Coir fibres are found between the hard, internal shell and the outer coat of a coconut. The individual fibre cells are narrow and hollow, with thick walls made of cellulose. They are pale when immature, but later become hardened and yellowed as a layer of lignin is deposited on their walls. 

Each cell is about long 

and in diameter.
 Fibres are typically long. The two varieties of coir are brown and white. Brown coir harvested from fully ripened coconuts is thick, strong and has high abrasion resistance. It is typically used in mats, brushes and sacking. Mature brown coir fibres contain more lignin and less cellulose than fibres such as flax and cotton, so are stronger but less flexible. White coir fibres harvested from coconuts before they are ripe are white or light brown in color and are smoother and finer, but also weaker. They are generally spun to make yarn used in mats or rope.

The coir fibre is relatively waterproof, and is one of the few natural fibres resistant to damage by saltwater. Fresh water is used to process brown coir, while seawater and fresh water are both used in the production of white coir.

==Processing==

Green coconuts, harvested after about six to 12 months on the palm, contain pliable white fibres. Brown fibre is instead obtained by harvesting fully mature coconuts when the nutritious layer surrounding the seed is ready to be processed into copra and desiccated coconut. The fibrous layer of the fruit is then separated from the hard shell (manually) by driving the fruit down onto a spike to split it (dehusking). A well-seasoned husker can manually separate 2,000 coconuts per day. Machines are now available which crush the whole fruit to give the loose fibres. These machines can process up to 2,000 coconuts per hour.

===Brown fibre===

The fibrous husks are soaked in pits or in nets in a slow-moving body of water to swell and soften the fibres. The long bristle fibres are separated from the shorter mattress fibres underneath the skin of the nut, a process known as wet-milling.

The mattress fibres are sifted to remove dirt and other rubbish, dried in the sun and packed into bales. Some mattress fibre is allowed to retain more moisture so it retains its elasticity for twisted fibre production. The coir fibre is elastic enough to twist without breaking and it holds a curl as though permanently waved. Twisting is done by simply making a rope of the hank of fibre and twisting it using a machine or by hand.

The longer bristle fibre is washed in clean water and then dried before being tied into bundles or hanks. It may then be cleaned and &#x27;hackled&#x27; by steel combs to straighten the fibres and remove any shorter fibre pieces. Coir bristle fibre can also be bleached and dyed to obtain hanks of different colours.

===White fibre===
The immature husks are suspended in a river or water-filled pit for up to ten months. During this time, micro-organisms break down the plant tissues surrounding the fibres to loosen them — a process known as retting. The segments of the husk are then beaten with iron rods to separate out the long fibres which are subsequently dried and cleaned. Cleaned fibre is ready for spinning into yarn using a simple one-handed system or a spinning wheel.

In 2009, researchers at CSIR&#x27;s National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology in Thiruvananthapuram developed a biological process for the extraction of coir fibre from coconut husk without polluting the environment. The technology uses enzymes to separate the fibres by converting and solubilizing plant compounds to curb the pollution of waters caused by retting of husks.

===Buffering===
Because coir pith is high in sodium and potassium, it is treated before use as a growth medium for plants or fungi by soaking in a calcium buffering solution; most coir sold for growing purposes is said to be pre-treated. Once any remaining salts have been leached out of the coir pith, it and the cocochips become suitable substrates for cultivating fungi. Coir is naturally rich in potassium, which can lead to magnesium and calcium deficiencies in soilless horticultural media. Coir fiber is rarely used as a potting material, except for orchids, and does not need buffering, as it has a very low cation-exchange capacity (CEC) capacity, hence not retaining salts.

Coir does provide a suitable substrate for horticultural use as a soilless potting medium. The material&#x27;s high lignin content is longer-lasting, holds more water, and does not shrink off the sides of the pot when dry allowing for easier rewetting. This light media has advantages and disadvantages that can be corrected with the addition of the proper amendment such as coarse sand for weight in interior plants like Draceana. Nutritive amendments should also be considered. Calcium and magnesium will be lacking in coir potting mixes, so a naturally good source of these nutrients is dolomitic lime which contains both. pH is of utmost importance as coir pith tends to have a high pH after some months of use, resulting in plant stunting and multiple deficiencies. Coir also has the disadvantage of being extremely sensitive to the Leucocoprinus greenhouse fungus. The addition of beneficial microbes to the coir media have been successful in tropical green house conditions and interior spaces as well. The fungi engage in growth and reproduction under moist atmospheres producing fruiting bodies (mushrooms).

===Bristle coir===
Bristle coir is the longest variety of coir fibre. It is manufactured from retted coconut husks through a process called defibering. The coir fibre thus extracted is then combed using steel combs to make the fibre clean and to remove short fibres. Bristle coir fibre is used as bristles in brushes for domestic and industrial applications.

==Uses==
===Cordage, packaging, bedding, flooring, and others===
Red coir is used in floor mats and doormats, brushes, mattresses, floor tiles and sacking. A small amount is also made into twine. Pads of curled brown coir fibre, made by needle-felting (a machine technique that mats the fibres together), are shaped and cut to fill mattresses and for use in erosion control on river banks and hillsides. A major proportion of brown coir pads are sprayed with rubber latex which bonds the fibres together (rubberised coir) to be used as upholstery padding for the automobile industry in Europe. The material is also used for packaging.

The major use of white coir is in rope manufacture. Mats of woven coir fibre are made from the finer grades of bristle and white fibre using hand or mechanical looms. White coir also is used to make fishing nets due to its strong resistance to saltwater.

===Agricultural and horticultural uses===
In agriculture and horticulture, coir is used as an organic and decorative component in soil and potting mixes. Due to the increasing concern regarding the sustainability of producing sphagnum (peat moss) and peat from peatlands, usage of alternative substrates has been on the rise; the byproduct coir is one commonly used substitute. Many sources of coir however are heavily contaminated with pathogenic fungi, and the choice of the source is important. Coir is also useful to deter snails from delicate plantings, and as a growing medium in intensive glasshouse (greenhouse) horticulture.
Coir is used in some hydroponic growing systems as an inert substrate medium. 

Coir is also used as a substrate to grow mushrooms. The coir is usually mixed with vermiculite and pasteurised with boiling water. After the coir/vermiculite mix has cooled to room temperature, it is placed in a larger container, usually a plastic box. Previously prepared spawn jars, usually grown using substrates such as rye grains or wild bird seed, are then added. This spawn is the mushroom&#x27;s mycelium and will colonize the coir/vermiculite mix, eventually fruiting mushrooms.

Coir can be used as a terrarium substrate for reptiles or arachnids.

Coir fibre pith or coir dust can hold large quantities of water, just like a sponge. It is used as a replacement for traditional peat in soil mixtures, or, as a soil-less substrate for plant cultivation. It has been called &quot;coco peat&quot; because it is to fresh coco fibre somewhat like what peat is to peat moss, although it is not true peat.

Coir waste from coir fibre industries is washed, heat-treated, screened and graded before being processed into coco peat products of various granularity and denseness, which are then used for horticultural and agricultural applications and as industrial absorbent.

Usually shipped in the form of compressed bales, briquettes, slabs or discs, the end user usually expands and aerates the compressed coco peat by the addition of water. A single kilogramme of dry coco peat will expand to 15 litres of moist coco peat.

Coco peat is used as a soil conditioner. Due to low levels of nutrients in its composition, coco peat is usually not the sole component in the medium used to grow plants. When plants are grown exclusively in coco peat, it is important to add nutrients according to the specific plants&#x27; needs. Coco peat from Philippines, Sri Lanka and India contains several macro- and micro-plant nutrients, including substantial quantities of potassium. This extra potassium can interfere with magnesium availability. Adding extra magnesium through the addition of magnesium sulphates can correct this issue.

Some coco peat is not fully decomposed when it arrives and will use up available nitrogen as it does so (known as drawdown), competing with the plant if there is not enough. This is called nitrogen robbery; it can cause nitrogen deficiency in the plants. Poorly sourced coco fibre can have excess salts in it and needs washing (check electrical conductivity of run-off water, flush if high). It holds water well and holds around 1,000 times more air than soil. Adding slow release fertilizers or organic fertilizers are highly advised when growing with coco fibre.

Common uses of coco fibre include:
* As a substitute for peat, because it is free of bacteria and most fungal spores, and is sustainably produced without the environmental damage caused by peat mining.
* Mixed with sand, compost and fertilizer to make good quality potting soil. Coco peat generally has an acidity in the range of pH - 5.5 to 6.5, which is slightly too acidic for some plants, but many popular plants can tolerate this pH range.
* As substrate for growing mushrooms, which thrive on the cellulose. Coco peat has high cellulose and lignin content.

Coco fibre can be re-used up to three times with little loss of yield. Coco fibre from diseased plants should not be re-used unless sterilization is thorough.

===Other uses===
====Oil and fluid absorption====
Due to its superior absorption capabilities when compared to products made of clay, silica and diatomaceous earth-based absorbents, dry coconut coir pith is gaining popularity as an oil and fluid absorbent. Many other absorbents have to be mined, whereas coconut coir pith is a waste product in abundance in countries where coconut is a major agriculture product.

In the 2024 Manila Bay oil spill, the DILG Bataan appealed for hay, hair and coconut coir pith (husk) to process into oil booms as absorbent for the Philippine Coast Guard&#x27;s cleanup operations.

====Animal bedding====
Coconut coir pith is also used as a bedding in litter boxes, animal farms and pet houses to absorb animal waste.

====Construction material====
Coconut fiber (coir) is used as a construction material because the natural fibers are eco-friendly. Additionally, coconut fiber (CF) has low thermal conductivity, is very tough, ductile, durable, renewable and inexpensive. It was observed in an experimental study that by partially replacing 2% of cement with CF, the compressive strength of the concrete is increased.

====Biocontrol====
Trichoderma coir pith cake (TCPC) has been prepared and successfully used for control of plant diseases. The dry product TCPC has a long shelf life.

== Safety ==

Coir is an allergen, as well as the latex and other materials used frequently in the treatment of coir.

===Biosecurity risks===

Coco fibre can harbor organisms that pose a threat to the biosecurity of countries into which it is imported. Coco peat has been imported into New Zealand since about 1989 with a marked increase since 2004. By 2009 a total of 25 new weed species have been found in imported coco peat. The regulations relating to importing coco peat into New Zealand have been amended to improve the biosecurity measures.

On the other hand, coir can also contain beneficial life-forms. Coconut coir from Mexico has been found to contain large numbers of colonies of the beneficial fungus &quot;Aspergillus terreus&quot;, which acts as a biological control against plant pathogenic fungi. &quot;Trichoderma&quot; is a naturally occurring fungus in coco peat; it works in symbiosis with plant roots to protect them from pathogenic fungi such as &quot;Pythium&quot;.

Coco peat may be sterilized to remove potential pathogens and weeds along with beneficial life. This may be done to remove contaminants in fresh material or to reuse old coir. Both heat (boiling or baking) and chemical means can be used.

==Major producers==

Total world coir fibre production is . India, mainly in the coastal region of Kerala State, produces 60% of the total world supply of white coir fibre. Sri Lanka produces 36% of the total brown fibre output. Over 50% of the coir fibre produced annually throughout the world is consumed in the countries of origin, mainly India. Together, India and Sri Lanka produced 59% of the coir produced in 2020. Sri Lanka remains the world&#x27;s largest exporter of coir fibre and coir fibre based products.

<text>In linguistics, code-switching or language alternation occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more languages, or language varieties, in the context of a single conversation or situation. These alternations are generally intended to influence the relationship between the speakers, for example, suggesting that they may share identities based on similar linguistic histories.

Code-switching is different from plurilingualism in that plurilingualism refers to the ability of an individual to use multiple languages, while code-switching is the act of using multiple languages together. Multilinguals (speakers of more than one language) sometimes use elements of multiple languages when conversing with each other. Thus, code-switching is the use of more than one linguistic variety in a manner consistent with the syntax and phonology of each variety. 

Code-switching may happen between sentences, sentence fragments, words, or individual morphemes (in synthetic languages). However, some linguists consider the borrowing of words or morphemes from another language to be different from other types of code-switching.

Code-switching can occur when there is a change in the environment in which one is speaking, or in the context of speaking a different language or switching the verbiage to match that of the audience. There are many ways in which code-switching is employed, such as when speakers are unable to express themselves adequately in a single language or to signal an attitude towards something. Several theories have been developed to explain the reasoning behind code-switching from sociological and linguistic perspectives.

== Use ==
The earliest known use of the term &quot;code-switching&quot; in print was published in 1953, in a chapter by Roman Jakobson in &quot;Results Conf. Anthropologists &amp; Linguists&quot;, written with C. F. Voegelin, T. A. Sebeok, and C. Lévi-Strauss. He attributes the idea to linguist William Freeman Twaddell, inspired by &quot;communication engineers&quot;. In the 1950s, many scholars considered code-switching to be a substandard use of language. Since the 1980s, however, most scholars have come to regard it as a normal, natural product of bilingual and multilingual language use.

In popular usage and in sociolinguistic study, the term code-switching is frequently used to refer to switching among dialects, styles or registers. This form of switching is practiced, for example, by speakers of African American Vernacular English as they move from less formal to more formal settings. Such shifts, when performed by public figures such as politicians, are sometimes criticized as signaling inauthenticity or insincerity. 

The term &quot;code-switching&quot; is also used outside the field of linguistics. Informally, &quot;code-switching&quot; is sometimes used to refer to relatively stable informal mixtures of two languages, such as Spanglish, Taglish, or Hinglish. Some scholars of literature use the term to describe literary styles that include elements from more than one language, as in novels by Chinese-American, Anglo-Indian, or Latino writers.

As switching between languages is exceedingly common and takes many forms, we can recognize code-switching more often as sentence alternation. A sentence may begin in one language, and finish in another. Or phrases from both languages may succeed each other in apparently random order. Such behavior can be explained only by postulating a range of linguistic or social factors such as the following:

* Speakers cannot express themselves adequately in one language, so they switch to another to work around the deficiency. This may trigger a speaker to continue in the other language for a while.
* Switching to a minority language is very common as a means of expressing solidarity with a social group. The language change signals to the listener that the speaker is from a certain background; if the listener responds with a similar switch, a degree of rapport is established.
* The switch between languages can signal the speaker&#x27;s attitude towards the listener - friendly, irritated, distant, ironic, jocular and so on. Monolinguals can communicate these effects to some extent by varying the level of formality of their speech; bilinguals can do it by language switching.
Code-switching involves the capacity of bilingual individuals to switch between different languages within a single conversation. John Guiteriz notes that it is important to note that code-switching is most commonly observed among bilingual individuals who are highly skilled in both languages and is actually prevalent in numerous bilingual communities, contrary to common beliefs. The patterns of language switching exhibited by the speaker can be influenced by the listener&#x27;s level of proficiency in the languages or their personal language preferences.

== Distinguishing features ==
Code-switching is distinct from other language contact phenomena, such as borrowing, pidgins and creoles, and loan translation (calques). Borrowing affects the lexicon, the words that make up a language, while code-switching takes place in individual utterances. Speakers form and establish a pidgin language when two or more speakers who do not speak a common language form an intermediate, third language. Speakers also practice code-switching when they are each fluent in both languages. Code-mixing is a thematically related term, but the usage of the terms &quot;code-switching&quot; and &quot;code-mixing&quot; varies. Some scholars use either term to denote the same practice, while others apply &quot;code-mixing&quot; to denote the formal linguistic properties of language-contact phenomena and &quot;code-switching&quot; to denote the actual, spoken usages by multilingual persons.

=== Code-switching and language transfer ===
There is much debate in the field of linguistics regarding the distinction between code-switching and language transfer. According to Jeanine Treffers-Daller, &quot;considering CS [code-switching] and [language] transfer as similar phenomena is helpful if one wants to create a theory that is as parsimonious as possible, and therefore it is worth attempting to aim for such a unified approach, unless there is compelling evidence that this is not possible.&quot;

Not all linguists agree on whether they should be considered similar phenomena. In some cases, linguists refer to the benefits and disadvantages of language transfer as two separate phenomena, i.e., language transference and language interference, respectively. In such views, these two kinds of language transfer, along with code-switching, comprise what is known as cross-linguistic influence.

Part of the debate may be solved by simply clarifying some key definitions. Evidently, linguists sometimes use different terminology to refer to the same phenomenon, which can make it confusing to distinguish between two phenomena from one another in investigative discourse. For instance, psycholinguists frequently make use of the term language switching in reference to the &quot;controlled and willed switching&quot; to another language. However, this term is hardly used by linguists working on natural code-switching.

Nevertheless, adopting the notion that code-switching involves switching between languages by a multilingual speaker fluent in the languages being alternated can alleviate the contention behind this debate. This is so because language transfer does not require such a switch between language systems to be performed by a multilingual speaker fluent in the alternated languages. As a result, this can account for transfer errors, when proficiency in one language is lower than the proficiency of the speaker in the other.

On the other hand, there are linguists that maintain &quot;that CS and transfer are manifestations of the same phenomenon, i.e. the influence of one language on another, is an attractive null hypothesis that can be tested in experimental settings.&quot;

== Easily confused terms ==
Some terms are commonly confused with usage when discussing code-switching. Sometimes they are used interchangeably as there is not a fixed and definitive definition of code-switching in the field. Below are some commonly considered definitions by scholars in the field of these terms easily confused with code-switching, highlighting the differences between them and code-switching.

Code-meshing is considered to be the combination or variation of one language with other linguistic aspects of the same language, like linguistic traditions, or simply with other languages. Whereas code-switching can indicate one language having higher recognition over another in certain settings, resulting in the latter being transmitted into the former or even being switched out for the former, code-meshing may indicate the achievement of a relative linguistic equality. The resulting product of code-meshing turns out to be more of an integration or system of language, instead of having the different components of the product separated or segregated. Therefore, it even avoids some issues regarding racism and promotes rhetoric effectiveness compared to code-switching.

Translingual or translanguaging may have come in the form of a combination of language usage with nonlinguistic elements. For example, people can use multiple different languages plus drawing symbol or small images to express one message or idea by putting them together on a surface. When compared to code-switching, it has a more common or fixed purpose of making sense or conveying meanings. Some scholars use the term translingualism to broadly describe the behavior of combining different languages together without prescriptive definition and articulation. Specifically, they consider translingualism to be highly the usage of multiple language in writing and divide it into translingual work, translingual negotiation and translingual rhetoric for discussion and research study purpose.

== Rationale ==

There are several reasons to switch codes in a single conversation:
* : People generally switch codes during discourse about a particular topic when a specific language is necessary or preferred; alternative speech may better convey relevant concepts. For example, some Afrobarometer surveys were conducted in the language used in school because certain concepts only exist in that language, and switched to a tribal or community language they grew up with for everyday concepts. 
* : People will switch codes while quoting another person.
* : When expressing gratitude or solidarity, code-switching can occur inadvertently or with the intention of fostering a rapport.
* : A speaker may engage in code-switching when listeners have difficulty comprehending specific words or concepts initially, or when the speaker does not know or remember the appropriate words in one of the languages.
* : People may alter their language to express group identification. This can happen, for example, when introducing members of a particular group to others.
* : While asking someone to do something, code-switching works to mark emphasis or provide inspiration.
* : People often use technical or idiomatic speech from a foreign or non-primary language; code-switching occurs when translating such words or phrases could distort the precise meaning.
* : People may engage in code-switching without thinking about it. This can occur when one is frightened by a specific event or circumstances such as going on a thrilling ride at an amusement park. 
* : Code-switching is a useful tool for people to talk and act more like those around them.
* : People code-switching to a dialect, language, or accent of the local people in the area may get better deals, prices, or treatments when purchasing an item or service.
* : Black Americans sometimes opt to use White-sounding verbiage and speech patterns in certain situations where the power dynamic is imbalanced, such as job interviews with a White employer.
* : Code-switching can be used when a person wants to relay a message to another person with the intention that no one else around them can understand if they converse in another language.

== Types ==
Scholars use different names for various types of code-switching.

* occurs &quot;outside&quot; the sentence or the clause level (i.e. at sentence or clause boundaries). It is sometimes called . In Assyrian-English switching one could say, &quot;&quot;Ani wideili.&quot; What happened?&quot; (&quot;&quot;Those, I did them.&quot; What happened?&quot;).
* occurs &quot;within&quot; a sentence or a clause. In Spanish-English switching one could say, &quot;&quot;La onda&quot; is to fight &quot;y jambar.&quot; (&quot;The latest fad&quot; is to fight &quot;and steal.&quot;&quot;)
* is the switching of either a tag phrase or a word, or both, from one language to another, (common in &quot;intra-sentential switches&quot;). In Spanish-English switching one could say, &quot;&quot;Él es de México y así los criaron a ellos&quot;, you know.&quot; (&quot;&quot;He&#x27;s from Mexico, and they raise them like that&quot;, you know.&quot;)
* occurs &quot;within&quot; a word itself, such as at a morpheme boundary. In Shona-English switching one could say, &quot;But &quot;ma&quot;-day-s &quot;a-no a-ya ha-ndi-si ku-mu-on-a.&quot; (&quot;But &quot;these&quot; days &quot;I don&#x27;t see him much.&quot;&quot;) Here the English plural morpheme -&quot;s&quot; appears alongside the Shona prefix &quot;ma&quot;-, which also marks plurality.

Most code-switching studies primarily focus on intra-sentential switching, as it creates many hybrid grammar structures that require explanation. The other types involve utterances that simply follow the grammar of one language or the other. Intra-sentential switching can be alternational or insertional. In alternational code-switching, a new grammar emerges that is a combination of the grammars of the two languages involved. Insertional code-switching involves &quot;the insertion of elements from one language into the morphosyntactic frame of the other.&quot;

A is a particular type of intrasentential code-switching. It is a hybrid involving structures from two different languages in one sentence in which an item in one language is used as a bridge between portions of the sentence in languages which have differing word order typologies. It is more of a &quot;syntactic blend&quot; than the kind of lexical blend one sees in portmanteau words such as &quot;smog&quot;.

Almedia Jacqueleline Toribio&#x27;s study aims to answer a fundamental question: How do second language learners acquire the necessary knowledge to maintain structural coherence and make well-formedness judgments when using code-switched forms? The study reveals that there are two main beneficial aspects of code-switching. Both developmental patterns contribute to assessing methodological linguisitic constructs. Toribio offers an illustration of intrasentential code-switching, showcasing consistent grammatical patterns. Proficient bilingual individuals, equipped with advanced proficiency in both languages, engage in intra-sentential code alternations.

=== &#x27;Intrasentential&#x27; code-switching vs. &#x27;Insertional&#x27; code-switching ===
Intrasentential code-switching should be distinguished from the related linguistic phenomenon of &#x27;insertional code-switching&#x27;. Toribio defines &#x27;Intrasentential code-switching&#x27; as the practice of switching between two languages within a single sentence structure while adhering to grammatical rules. Skilled bilingual individuals, who are competent in both languages, can judge whether the acceptability of such code-switching is grammatically and functionally correct.

Insertional code-switching is often referred to as &#x27;borrowing&#x27; or &#x27;tag-switching&#x27;. Toribio refers to &#x27;Insertional code-switching&#x27; when lexical items from a secondary language are introduced into the primary language. These loan words are partially or fully assimilated into the secondary language, conforming to its phonological and morphological structure. Insertional code-switching serves a &quot;pragmatic purpose, acting as sentence enhancers or indicating the speaker&#x27;s attitude towards the context of an utterance.&quot;

Example of &#x27;Intrasentential code-switching&#x27;

1) Llegamos a los Estados Unidos en los 60s. We came to New York in the 60s.

&quot;We arrived in the United States in the 60s. We came to New York in the 60s.&quot;

2) Code-switching among bilinguals ha sido la fuente de numerosas investigaciones.

&quot;Code-switching among bilinguals has been the source of numerous studies.&quot;

Toribio also provides an instance of &#x27;Insertional code-switching&#x27;, which demonstrates the incorporation of specific lexical elements into a target language. The borrowed words can be integrated into the host language either partially or entirely, taking into account their phonological and morphological structure.

Example of &#x27;Insertional code-switching&#x27;:

1) El estudiante leyó el libro en el reference room.

&quot;The student read the book in the reference room.&quot;

2) I met up with m&quot;y compadres at the fiesta&quot;.

&quot;I met up with my buddies at the party.&quot;

== Code-switching in language education ==
In most language education programs, such as English as a Second Language (ESL) programs, educators and learners have significant proficiency differences in their target language (the language which those learners are learning). Therefore, under such condition, code-switching is often a very common method to establish communication between educators and learners.

=== Applications in language learning process ===
The application of code-switching under such a condition can be divided into two main different situations: one is the interaction between learners and the educator, and the other is the communication between students and classmates. Linguists and educators have different opinions and views toward the use of code-switching under different situations in language teaching, so the two situations will be discussed separately. Assuming that both learners and language teachers have the same native language background, which means that everyone can use their same native language to build normal communication. In addition, the situation of foreign teachers (whose native language is the target language), and students from diverse backgrounds (each student has a different native language) are not included.

According to Grace Cornell Gonzales and Emily Machado, many teachers adapt their teaching styles to code-switching because they believe that it allows students to feel as if they are maintaining their full identity. Some educators allow students to code-switch when talking or writing. This strategy has been seen to be effective because it allows students to communicate their experiences just how they felt them happen. In some cases, some teachers will participate in code-switching when interacting with students because it allows students to feel more comfortable. According to Barbara Mellix, code-switching also allows students to feel more confident and secure with their languages and writing because they see that code-switching is acceptable in certain instances. Although code-switching can become difficult to control, it has been said that speaking and writing go hand in hand: if a person can write, then they can speak and control their switch in the same or similar way. According to Ena Lee and Steve Marshall, the process of code-switching in a classroom also allows for a &quot;greater access&quot; to knowledge. It is important to note that code-switching occurs more often with those whose dominant language is not standard English.

Code switching involves utilizing entire sentences, phrases, and borrowed vocabulary from a different language. It is a prevalent linguistic occurrence observed among individuals who are bilingual. To proficiently engage in code switching, students need to possess a substantial comprehension of both cultures, along with a profound understanding of the fundamental structures and functions of language systems. Contrary to the conventional notion of code switching representing a disadvantaged and partially literate upbringing, it actually signifies an intellectual advantage.

Nevertheless, code switching has typically not been regarded as a favorable attribute by educational institutions, teachers, or the dominant culture. The methods employed for assessing and identifying giftedness have traditionally focused on a single language or relied on criteria and behaviors that align with the values and norms of the majority culture.

Historically, there has been a prevalent tendency to discourage code switching in both the educational system and society as a whole. Jean Aitchison&#x27;s notes that discouragement stems from concerns regarding the potential negative impact on the languages involved, which could potentially lead to language erosion or decline. According to Aitchison, one possible explanation for the widespread disapproval of language variations is rooted in social-class prejudice. There exists a general belief that someone should arbitrate between the different forms of English. Aitchison concludes that the puristic stance toward language, which maintains the idea of an absolute standard of correctness, has its roots in a natural inclination towards nostalgia, further amplified by social pressures.

On the other hand, Adalberot Aguirre Jr. argues that language alternation, commonly known as code-switching, can serve as a valuable teaching and learning strategy in the bilingual classroom. A bilingual teacher possesses an intuitive understanding of bilingual behavior, which can play a crucial role in constructing a sociolinguistic profile of the student in such a classroom. This understanding enables the teacher to determine three key aspects: 1) the nature of the code-switching and how it occurs; 2) whether a student is mixing or alternating languages in a manner that indicates confusion; and 3) criteria for discerning between code-switching that carries meaning and code-switching that lacks significance.

Aguirre asserts that a bilingual teacher&#x27;s intuitive knowledge of bilingual behavior can be instrumental in his or her construction of a sociolinguistic profile for the student in the bilingual classroom. He supports his argument by outlining three ways in which a teacher&#x27;s intuitive knowledge can benefit bilingual children in the classroom. Firstly, if a teacher&#x27;s intuitive knowledge suggests that a child possesses similar linguistic abilities in both languages, they may choose to alternate languages during instruction. This approach aims to enhance sentence complexity and expand the student&#x27;s vocabulary, thereby strengthening their intuitive knowledge base for bilingual behavior. Secondly, a bilingual teacher&#x27;s intuition may alert them to instances where a bilingual student is mixing languages in a way that indicates confusion rather than intentional code switching. Lastly, teachers can utilize their intuitive understanding of code switching to establish criteria for distinguishing meaningful code switching from meaningless instances.

=== Code-switching among learners ===
In these language education programs, the most common situation is that the learners do not have proficient language skills in the targeting language. For some examples, the vocabulary mastery of the learners is not enough to build the desired conversation or the learners lack of the abilities to construct sentence in the targeting language structure. In this case, it is impractical to build a complete conversation in the target language. In order to establish a clearer conversation in target language, learners often inevitably use code-switching so that they use their mother tongue to fill the gap caused by the lack of proficiency in the target language. Code-switching&#x27;s occurrence in this case can reflected in a phenomenon known as &quot;Cited Language&quot;. This phenomenon simply means that Code-switching is used as a tool to fill in the lexical gaps that arise when establishing conversation in the target language. A simple example for this is to ask how to say a certain thing or a certain word in the target language. In addition, students in these language learning programs could actively avoid using Code-switching, either because of their own desire to establish a pure conversation in targeting language or because of the demands of their instructor. This is reflected in the fact that learners in these language programs often use code-switching briefly in a low-voice manner to help form a complete dialogue. Although the presence of code-switching in language learning programs is common, there are some educators who believe that the use of code-switching can cause dependency. For example, with frequent use of code-switching, students do not quickly adapt to speaking purely in the target language. Moreover, in language programs where the native language is quite different from the target language, the use of code-switching can lead to confusion about grammar and other sentence structures.

=== Code-switching for educators ===
In contrast with learners, educators usually have a higher level of proficiency in the target language which means they can use the target language for normal communication without barriers. Educators can converse fluently in both languages, so they have a choice as to whether and how often code-switching is used in the language teaching process. From the perspective of learning, in most cases, these frequencies are often inversely correlated with the learners&#x27; proficiency in the target language, that is, the higher the proficiency of the learners, the rarer the occurrence of code-switching.

From another perspective, compared to enhancing knowledge construction, some of these moves are done unintentionally because speaking in native languages simply helps reducing the complexity of communication, which simplified communication is also easier for students to understand what their teacher is trying to convey. A code-switched expression can be useful rather than in academic conversation that student actually learning languages through figuring out complicated sentences. These situations might cover maintaining class order, understanding students&#x27; mental health state, or making clarifications. Although instructors have the ability to choose whether or not to use code-switching, the question of when and how often to use it remains controversial. It is undeniable that code-switching is a powerful tool for making clarifications in many cases, especially when the scholar is extremely unfamiliar with the target language. But on the other hand, the use of code-switching by teachers can also lead to students not being able to adapt to new language situations.

== Code-switching in the classroom ==

Code-switching in the classroom can be challenging because it requires adapting to different languages &quot;and&quot; cultural norms. Students tend to assimilate into the new culture to fit in with other students. The way students talk, learn, and think begins to change because they start learning what is the &quot;correct&quot; way of speaking. The difficulty of adapting to a new language and culture with different rules and norms is often understated.

Henry Lawert emphasizes how &quot;an effective knowledge of English is not as universal as many of us would like to believe.&quot; Teaching non-native speakers can be a challenge, especially when the classroom&#x27;s primary language is a secondary language or the student isn&#x27;t fluent. Many students speak other languages at home, making learning the classroom&#x27;s primary language more challenging. When switching languages, it can become difficult for a child to understand what is going on in the classroom, and might learn at a different pace than other students. Teachers start to label children as &quot;inadequate&quot; or &quot;behind&quot;. As a result, children start feeling resentment towards their own culture and begin to think their native language is inferior or invalidated. With an average classroom class being 30:1, it can be difficult to receive help from a teacher, and even more difficult when the student prefers to use a different language.
This can discourage students, and it can become harmful to the long-term aptitude of students, even after they reach fluency.

Many consider code-switching harmful to the classroom, especially for particular populations of students whose first language may not be the language of the country they reside. Code-switching is considered by some as a racist pedagogy that upholds the structure of domination of the English language. This is because code-switching encourages a monolingual classroom which prevents students from thinking or speaking in ways that come easiest to them.

Instead many prefer the alternative of code-meshing, where all languages and dialects are valued equally. This pedagogy celebrates and encourages students to use their primary language to diversify and improve their school work without limiting them to a singular language. It exposes students to more cultures in an unfiltered way.

Some teachers consider code-switching useful in the classroom because it helps students who do not speak standard English as their first language feel more welcomed in the class and also learn the material more easily. It also helps with learning a new language since it allows students to guess what words in another language mean outside of the context that is given in their native language. One of the challenges with code-switching is that teachers have to consider that if they code-switch or otherwise use more than one language in their classroom, they have to ensure that the students truly understand what the content is in the different language. To do so, teachers often lessen the amount of material that they cover, teaching their students only the basics and allowing them to learn the rest by themselves.

Code-switching can pressure students to conform to one language over another. For some students it can lead to a feeling of disconnection to their own culture, and that those students are betraying their culture by learning English over their mother tongue. Being a non-native speaker in a foreign country can lead to total isolation due to the inability to communicate. There is this sense of feeling lost and many feel the need to hide their cultural identity. Many educators have argued that in a classroom, all cultures should be celebrated and students should feel like they are fully accepted and valued for who they are.

Code-switching is very common in classrooms of multiple languages for many different purposes. 

== Code-switching in remote settings ==
Code-switching in remote settings has become higher on the writing agenda due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote settings have taken the likes of social media, emails, and any other setting where communication has been made via online platforms. A study done by Cambridge University looked into how code-switching is present on remote, online platforms. Looking at tweets from Twitter regarding Hurricane Irma, researchers looked to see how posting went hand in hand with the impacted English and Spanish speaking countries. They found that many utilized English due to the platform&#x27;s systemic influences. However, translations were prevalent in tweets to make them accessible to both English and Spanish speakers. To understand the relationship between how often people code-switched, the researchers calculated the proportion of code-switches of prior and current Tweets. The results of the study found that language switching produces Tweets that are better at conveying messages the individual wished to put across. Likewise, they found that multilingual individuals differed their code switches based on the language used in their previous Tweets. Due to the difficulty to use multiple languages in the same sentence in writing, more messages were English than in Spanish. Finally, when comparing non-code switching Tweets by the same writer, those with code-switching present had more complex language. This study is only one of potentially many studies to be done. Writing studies has much more to dissect about remote code-switching. Potential research could look into Zoom etiquette, Discord forums, etc.

== Theories ==
===Social theories===

Code-switching relates to, and sometimes indexes social-group membership in bilingual and multilingual communities. Some sociolinguists describe the relationships between code-switching behaviours and class, ethnicity, and other social positions.
In addition, scholars in interactional linguistics and conversation analysis have studied code-switching as a means of structuring speech in interaction. Some discourse analysts, including conversation analyst Peter Auer, suggest that code-switching does not simply reflect social situations, but that it is a means to create social situations.

====Markedness model====

The Markedness model, developed by Carol Myers-Scotton, is one of the more complete theories of code-switching motivations. It posits that language users are rational and choose to speak a language that clearly marks their rights and obligations, relative to other speakers, in the conversation and its setting. When there is no clear, unmarked language choice, speakers practice code-switching to explore possible language choices. Many sociolinguists, however, object to the Markedness Model&#x27;s postulation that language-choice is entirely rational.

====Sequential analysis====
Scholars of conversation analysis such as Peter Auer and Li Wei argue that the social motivation behind code-switching lies in the way code-switching is structured and managed in conversational interaction; in other words, the question of why code-switching occurs cannot be answered without first addressing the question of how it occurs. Using conversation analysis (CA), these scholars focus their attention on the sequential implications of code-switching. That is, whatever language a speaker chooses to use for a conversational turn, or part of a turn, impacts the subsequent choices of language by the speaker as well as the hearer. Rather than focusing on the social values inherent in the languages the speaker chooses (&quot;brought-along meaning&quot;), the analysis concentrates on the meaning that the act of code-switching itself creates (&quot;brought-about meaning&quot;).

====Communication accommodation theory====
The communication accommodation theory (CAT), developed by Howard Giles, professor of communication at the University of California, Santa Barbara, seeks to explain the cognitive reasons for code-switching, and other changes in speech, as a person either emphasizes or minimizes the social differences between himself and the other person(s) in conversation. Giles posits that when speakers seek approval in a social situation they are likely to converge their speech with that of the other speaker. This can include, but is not limited to, the language of choice, accent, dialect, and para-linguistic features used in the conversation. In contrast to convergence, speakers might also engage in divergent speech, in which an individual person emphasizes the social distance between himself and other speakers by using speech with linguistic features characteristic of his own group.

====Diglossia====
In a diglossic situation, some topics are better suited to the use of one language over another. Joshua Fishman proposes a domain-specific code-switching model (later refined by Blom and Gumperz) wherein bilingual speakers choose which code to speak depending on where they are and what they are discussing. For example, a child who is a bilingual Spanish-English speaker might speak Spanish at home and English in class, but Spanish at recess.

===Linguistic theories===
In studying the syntactic and morphological patterns of language alternation, linguists have postulated specific grammatical rules and specific syntactic boundaries for where code-switching might occur.

====Constraint-based model: Poplack (1980)====

Shana Poplack&#x27;s model of code-switching is an influential theory of the grammar of code-switching. In this model, code-switching is subject to two constraints. The &quot;free-morpheme constraint&quot; stipulates that code-switching cannot occur between a lexical stem and bound morphemes. Essentially, this constraint distinguishes code-switching from borrowing. Generally, borrowing occurs in the lexicon, while code-switching occurs at either the syntax level or the utterance-construction level. The &quot;equivalence constraint&quot; predicts that switches occur only at points where the surface structures of the languages coincide, or between sentence elements that are normally ordered in the same way by each individual grammar. For example, the sentence: &quot;I like you &quot;porque eres simpático&quot;&quot; (&quot;I like you &quot;because you are friendly&quot;&quot;) is allowed because it obeys the syntactic rules of both Spanish and English. On the contrary, cases like the noun phrases &quot;the casa white&quot; and &quot;the blanca house&quot; are ruled out because the combinations are ungrammatical in at least one of the languages involved. Spanish noun phrases are made up of determiners, then nouns, then adjectives, while the adjectives come before the nouns in English noun phrases. &quot;The casa white&quot; is ruled out by the equivalence constraint because it does not obey the syntactic rules of English, and &quot;the blanca house&quot; is ruled out because it does not follow the syntactic rules of Spanish.

Moreover, some observations on Sankoff and Poplack&#x27;s model were later pointed out by outside researchers. The observations regard that free-morpheme and equivalence constraints are insufficiently restrictive, meaning there are numerous exceptions that occur. For example, the free morpheme constraint does not account for why switching is impossible between certain free morphemes. The sentence: &quot;The students had &quot;visto la película italiana&quot;&quot; (&quot;The students had &quot;seen the Italian movie&quot;&quot;) does not occur in Spanish-English code-switching, yet the free-morpheme constraint would seem to posit that it can. The equivalence constraint would also rule out switches that occur commonly in languages, as when Hindi postpositional phrases are switched with English prepositional phrases like in the sentence: &quot;John gave a book &quot;ek larakii ko&quot;&quot; (&quot;John gave a book &quot;to a girl&quot;&quot;). The phrase &quot;ek larakii ko&quot; is literally translated as &quot;a girl to&quot;, making it ungrammatical in English, and yet this is a sentence that occurs in English-Hindi code-switching despite the requirements of the equivalence constraint. Sankoff and Poplack&#x27;s model focuses on the instances where code-switching does not interfere with the syntactic rule of the speaker&#x27;s primary or second language. Although the model has been challenged with counter-examples collected by other researchers, there is a conclusion that most agree on. The conclusion is that the practice of code-switching demonstrates grammatical proficiency of an equivalent level as a monolingual speaker&#x27;s speech competence, unlike the claims that code-switching reflects incompetence in either of the two languages of a bilingual speaker.

====Matrix language-frame model====

Carol Myers-Scotton&#x27;s Matrix Language-Frame (MLF) model is the dominant model of insertional code-switching. The MLF model posits that there is a Matrix Language (ML) and an Embedded Language (EL). In this case, elements of the Embedded Language are inserted into the morphosyntactic frame of the Matrix Language. The hypotheses are as follows (Myers-Scotton 1993b: 7):

The Matrix Language Hypothesis states that those grammatical procedures in the central structure in the language production system which account for the surface structure of the Matrix Language + Embedded Language constituent (linguistics) are only Matrix Language–based procedures. Further, the hypothesis is intended to imply that frame-building precedes content morpheme insertion. A Matrix Language can be the first language of the speaker or the language in which the morphemes or words are more frequently used in speech, so the dominant language is the Matrix Language and the other is the Embedded Language. A Matrix Language island is a constituent composed entirely of Matrix Language morphemes.

According to the Blocking Hypothesis, in Matrix Language + Embedded Language constituents, a blocking filter blocks any Embedded Language content morpheme which is not congruent with the Matrix Language with respect to three levels of abstraction regarding subcategorization. &quot;Congruence&quot; is used in the sense that two entities, linguistic categories in this case, are congruent if they correspond in respect of relevant qualities.

The three levels of abstraction are:
* Even if the Embedded Language realizes a given grammatical category as a content morpheme, if it is realized as a system morpheme in the Matrix Language, the Matrix Language blocks the occurrence of the Embedded Language content morpheme. (A content morpheme is often called an &quot;open-class&quot; morpheme, because they belong to categories that are open to the invention of arbitrary new items. They can be made-up words like &quot;smurf&quot;, &quot;nuke&quot;, &quot;byte&quot;, etc. and can be nouns, verbs, adjectives, and some prepositions. A system morpheme, e.g. function words and inflections, expresses the relation between content morphemes and does not assign or receive thematic roles.)
* The Matrix Language also blocks an Embedded Language content morpheme in these constituents if it is not congruent with a Matrix Language content morpheme counterpart in terms of theta role assignment. 
*Congruence between Embedded Language content morphemes and Matrix Language content morphemes is realized in terms of their discourse or pragmatic functions.

=====Examples=====
*Hindustani (Urdu or Hindi)/English

* Swahili/English
We see that example 1 is consistent with the Blocking Hypothesis and the system content morpheme criteria, so the prediction is that the Hindi or Urdu equivalents are also content morphemes. Sometimes non-congruence between counterparts in the Matrix Language and Embedded Language can be circumvented by accessing bare forms. &quot;Cell&quot; is a bare form and so the thematic role of &quot;cell&quot; is assigned by the verb &quot;-wek-&quot; &#x27;put in/on&#x27;; this means that the verb is a content morpheme.

The Embedded Language Island Trigger Hypothesis states that when an Embedded Language morpheme appears which is not permitted under either the Matrix Language Hypothesis or Blocking Hypothesis, it triggers the inhibition of all Matrix Language accessing procedures and completes the current constituent as an Embedded Language island. Embedded Language islands consist only of Embedded Language morphemes and are well-formed by Embedded Language grammar, but they are inserted in the Matrix Language frame. Therefore, Embedded Language islands are under the constraint of Matrix Language grammar.

* Swahili/English

* Swahili/English
Example 1 is ungrammatical (indicated by the leading asterisk) because &quot;your&quot; is accessed, so the Embedded Language Island Trigger Hypothesis predicts that it must be followed by an English head (e.g., &quot;your letter&quot;) as an Embedded Language island. The reason is that possessive adjectives are system morphemes. We see the same thing happen in example 2, which is therefore ungrammatical. However, the correct way to finish the sentence is not &quot;for wewe&quot;, switching back to Swahili; rather, it should end with &quot;for you&quot;, which would be an Embedded Language island.

The Embedded Language Implicational Hierarchy Hypothesis can be stated as two sub-hypotheses: 
# The farther a constituent is from the main arguments of the sentence, the freer it is to appear as an Embedded Language island. 
# The more formulaic in structure a constituent is, the more likely it is to appear as an Embedded Language island. Stated more strongly, choice of any part of an idiomatic expression will result in an Embedded Language island.

The Implication Hierarchy of Embedded Language Islands:
# Formulaic expressions and idioms (especially prepositional phrases expressing time and manner, but also as verb phrase complements)
# Other time and manner expressions
# Quantifier expressions
# Non-quantifier, non-time noun phrases as verb phrase complements
# Agent Noun phrases
# Theme role and case assigners, i.e. main finite verbs (with full inflections)

* Wolof/French
* Arabic/English
* Swahili/English

We see example 1 work because the French Embedded Language island &quot;Le matin de bonne heure&quot;, &quot;early in the morning&quot;, is a time expression. (Also, it is repeated in Wolof in the second sentence.) In example 2, we see the quantifier &quot;a lot of&quot; is a predicted Embedded Language island. Here we see an objective complement of a finite verb begin with the quantifier.

====Constraint-free approach====
Jeff MacSwan has posited a &quot;constraint-free approach&quot; to analyzing code-switching. This approach views explicit reference to code-switching in grammatical analysis as tautological, and seeks to explain specific instances of grammaticality in terms of the unique contributions of the grammatical properties of the languages involved. MacSwan characterizes the approach with the refrain, &quot;Nothing constrains code-switching apart from the requirements of the mixed grammars.&quot; The approach focuses on the repudiation of any rule or principle which explicitly refers to code-switching itself. This approach does not recognize or accept terms such as &quot;matrix language&quot;, &quot;embedded language&quot;, or &quot;language frame&quot;, which are typical in constraint-based approaches such as the MLF Model.

Rather than posit constraints specific to language alternation, as in traditional work in the field, MacSwan advocates that mixed utterances be analyzed with a focus on the specific and unique linguistic contributions of each language found in a mixed utterance. Because these analyses draw on the full range of linguistic theory, and each data set presents its own unique challenges, a much broader understanding of linguistics is generally needed to understand and participate in this style of codeswitching research.

For example, Cantone and MacSwan (2009) analyzed word order differences for nouns and adjectives in Italian-German codeswitching using a typological theory of Cinque that had been independently proposed in the syntax literature; their account derives the word order facts of Italian-German codeswitching from underlying differences between the two languages, according to Cinque&#x27;s theory.

Myers-Scotton and MacSwan debated the relative merits of their approaches in a series of exchanges published in 2005 in &quot;&quot;, issues 8(1) and 8(2).

====Other theories====
Much remains to be done before a more complete understanding of code-switching phenomena is achieved. Linguists continue to debate apparent counter-examples to proposed code-switching theories and constraints.

The &quot;Closed-class Constraint&quot;, developed by Aravind Joshi, posits that closed class items (pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) cannot be switched. The &quot;Functional Head Constraint&quot; developed by Belazi et al. holds that code-switching cannot occur between a functional head (a complementizer, a determiner, an inflection, etc.) and its complement (sentence, noun-phrase, verb-phrase). These constraints, among others like the Matrix Language-Frame model, are controversial among linguists positing alternative theories, as they are seen to claim universality and make general predictions based upon specific presumptions about the nature of syntax.

== Neuroscience ==
=== Bilingual advantage ===
Compared to their monolingual peers, bilingual children seem to have some advantage in non-linguistic tasks related to executive and attentional control. For instance, they are able to identify relevant visual information and ignore irrelevant perceptual information better than monolingual children. Bilinguals employ these executive and attentional processes daily as they need to quickly be able to select the correct vocabulary and grammar in context. According to Ena Lee and Steve Marshall, people are also able to switch from their bi/multilingual identity to a strict monolingual identity whenever they are required to do so. According to a research study, bi/Multilingual people&#x27;s brains are working quicker than monolingual people&#x27;s brains because they are constantly switching between different languages. When writing, bi/multilingual people tend to go through different stages of writing styles, essentially allowing them to go through the learning process in more depth compared to monolingual writers. Code-switching is a writing tool that many people use in order to communicate with similar people whenever they are struggling with formulating words or ideas.

=== Bilingual disadvantage ===
Despite the advantages to code-switching in the classroom, research has shown that bilingual children seem to have more of a disadvantage compared to their monolingual peers. For example, many of them are required to write or speak in English in American schools, rather than writing and speaking in their native languages. Ena Lee and Steve Marshall state that &quot;many students are required to write or speak in English, causing them to push away their other known languages that make up a huge part of their identities.&quot; Oftentimes, children speak their native language at home whenever they are around their family, and then once they leave their homes they speak in English. According to Barbara Mellix, the switch in language causes a person to be careful and aware of their surroundings in order to know when it is acceptable to speak a certain language. On the contrary, whenever they feel comfortable around someone, they tend to code-switch and speak in a mixture of two languages or more. The adaptation to standard English language can be quite difficult for bi/multilingual speakers and Multilingual writers because they can feel unsupported and discouraged by the educational systems. Code-switching occurs very naturally and is hard to control for those who are fluent in more than one language.

During class writing activities, bi/multilingual students are often times faced with Writer&#x27;s block because they are constantly thinking in more than one language, making it difficult to narrow down their ideas so that they can be expressed in a single language. It has been noted that English grammar is one of the most important yet most difficult topics in English, which even monolingual students struggle with. Code-switching makes it very difficult to follow all of standard English grammar rules because students&#x27; brains are constantly wanting to switch from one language to another, making it harder for students to formulate good grammatical sentences. According to Barbara Mellix, bi/multilingual writers can oftentimes feel &quot;diminished&quot; or &quot;embarrassed&quot; whenever they are forced to solely stick to standard English because they are afraid to be wrong and stand out in a negative way compared to their monolingual peers.

=== Neuroanatomy ===
Research has shown that the knowledge and use of more than one language alters both the anatomical and functional organization of the brain, which leads to different functional capabilities both in language and other areas. Certain regions of the bilingual brain have been repeatedly shown to differ from those of monolinguals in both size and neural activity.

One such study (Michelli et al., 2004) showed significant increase in grey matter density in the left inferior parietal cortex of bilinguals relative to monolinguals as a specific instance of experience-dependent brain plasticity. Another study (Coggins et al., 2004) showed an increase in the volume of the anterior midbody of the corpus callosum, which is involved in primary and somatosensory function, in bilinguals. The research suggests the increase is an accommodation for the increased phonemic capacity requirement of bilinguals.

==== Subcortical network ====
By using case studies of bilingual patients with cerebral lesions, researchers theorized that language switching relies on the inhibition of the non-target language using the left basal ganglia alongside executive control processes with the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, and front cortices, or bilateral supramarginal gyri and Broca&#x27;s area. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has also been shown as significant in controlling language switching and inhibiting the unused language through observations of uncontrollable language switching in patients with damage to this brain area. Increased activation is seen in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during language switching, but not regularly.

==== Extended control process model ====
It is postulated that the language not in use is &quot;active&quot; during another language&#x27;s use and can be primed by a conversation. That priming is what makes it difficult to pinpoint changes in activation within any given network. Based on various studies, it is shown that the immediate spoken context affects the likelihood of a code-switch; &quot;prior utterances can influence the activation of lexico-syntactic representations, making such representations more available for selection&quot;.

The extended control process model states the following:&quot;Language control signals operate on a subcortical gate that acts as a constructor of utterance plans. The gate interacts with frontal regions to select a syntactic structure and binds roles in that structure to a specific lexical content. Plans are constructed in the planning layer of competition queuing CQ network. The competitive choice layer of this network allows serial order to emerge from the parallel activation of items in the plan.&quot; The model hypothesizes that single language use and code-switching use two different types of language control, which is competitive control and cooperative control, respectively. In competitive language control, the &quot;gate&quot; will only allow constructions from a single language to enter the plan. On the other hand, there are two forms of cooperative control: coupled control (&quot;the matrix language temporarily cedes control to other language to allow intended insertion or alternation before control is returned back&quot;) and open control (&quot;entry into the utterance planning mechanism is determined by whichever items from either language are most active at some moment in time&quot;).

=== Brain response ===
In a study published in 2001, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from native English speakers as they randomly named digits in English or their L2. The results of the study showed that participants named digits slower after a language switch, regardless of the switch direction. Language switches from the L1 to L2 were characterized with an N320 ERP, indicating inhibition of unwanted lexicon, which may reflect a greater need to suppress an active L1 when using L2. However, code-switching during language comprehension, as opposed to production, did not result in an N320.

A 2002 study showed that language switches based on expected endings to sentences (from context) elicited a response consistent with code switches being treated like &quot;unexpected events at the physical level than at the lexico-semantic level. The more proficient the bilingual in L2, the earlier the latency and the smaller the amplitude was this positivity to the code-switch.&quot;

=== Limitations ===
The lack of controlled environments for test subjects and their cognitive capabilities regarding language use and fluency has long been a concern in multilingual experimentation. Researchers try to &quot;offset&quot; results that follow no trends by analyzing the social and linguistic history of the populations they are testing, but a good method to standardize data patterns and variation based on individual idiolects has yet to be created and implemented.

Only a few studies have been done to measure brain activity during code switches, and so general trends cannot be expanded into larger theories without additional research.

== Examples in conversation ==
In this section, segments that are switched from the primary language of the conversation are shown in bold.

=== African-American English and Standard English ===
Children growing up in African American communities, who natively speak African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), acquire a kind of bilingualism (or bidialectism) when entering mainstream American classrooms. Teachers and academic expectations they encounter require them to use standard, higher-prestige linguistic features for school assignments and classroom participation, often effectively leading these students to develop an ability to code-switch rapidly between nonstandard AAVE and standard English features. This can pose a processing obstacle for some students who have to navigate subtle grammatical differences between the two varieties of English when interpreting prompts and instructions (see, e.g., Terry, et al., 2010 on past tense copula &quot;was/were&quot;). Age is a significant factor in determining how many AAVE forms vs. more standard forms are produced by a given student with a significant downshift in classroom AAVE production occurring around the transition from preschool to kindergarten and first grade. Craig and Washington (2004) found a reduction in five out of six morpho-syntactic characteristics studied across the transition from pre-kindergarten to kindergarten including null copula, zero articles, zero past tense, zero plurals, and zero prepositions. The bidialectism developed by these children offers similar advantages to other kinds of bilingualism including increased executive function and advances in critical thinking. As an example of this code-switching in action, see the following transcript of Rachel Jeantel&#x27;s testimony in the trial of George Zimmerman for the murder of Trayvon Martin below. This transcript was analyzed in Rickford and King (2016); the bolded elements represent places where initially a null copula (indicated by the symbol ∅) was used which was switched to an overt copula (&quot;&#x27;s&quot;) when asked for clarification by the court reporter:The structure of African American English differs significantly from standard English, particularly in the use of the Invariant &quot;be.&quot; An illustration of this distinction is evident in its application for habitual or repeated actions. In instances involving actions in the present with subjects other than &quot;I,&quot; the use of a form of &quot;be&quot; is omitted. For actions in the past tense, &quot;was&quot; or &quot;were&quot; is employed, while present tense questions utilize a conjugated form of &quot;be.&quot; Questions pertaining to habitual actions employ the combination of &quot;do&quot; and &quot;be.&quot; Notably, the Invariant &quot;be&quot; also serves to indicate future actions, wherein it may be optionally combined with an auxiliary. Unlike the verb &quot;to be,&quot; the Invariant &quot;be&quot; lacks variant forms such as &quot;is,&quot; &quot;are,&quot; or &quot;am&quot;. Getting to know the African American English is very important because many African American students use this English in class and then often get told to use the standard English forms. The invariant be is also considered a code switching because you technically switch in between two languages. Even though these languages are almost the same there are still some grammatical differences that makes the African American English its own language.

=== Cantonese and English ===

The following examples demonstrate two types of code-switching (intra-sentential and inter-sentential code-switching) by Cantonese-English bilingual children. The examples are taken from the Hong Kong Bilingual Child Language Corpus.

The first example illustrates intra-sentential code-switching, where the child Alicia (age 2) inserted the English noun &quot;apple&quot; into her Cantonese sentence:

The second example displays inter-sentential code-switching, where the child Kasen (age 2) switched to Cantonese amid an English dialogical context:

Research has found that Cantonese-English bilingual children&#x27;s intra- and inter-sentential code-switching behaviour is shaped by different factors. The children&#x27;s intra-sentential code-switching is influenced by parental input rather than developmental language dominance. On the other hand, the children&#x27;s inter-sentential code-switching is affected by their developmental language dominance (besides pragmatic factors). In Hong Kong, intra-sentential code-switching is a common social practice among adults. Since families provide the first social environment, and interaction with parents is highly influential in socializing children&#x27;s language use, parental input will have impact on children&#x27;s intra-sentential code-switching. On the other hand, inter-sentential code-switching is not as common in Hong Kong. It has been proposed that, for Cantonese-English children, their inter-sentential code-switching is related to their readiness, competency, and preference of speaking the designated language of the dialogical context; hence, their inter-sentential code-switching can be affected by developmental language dominance. This finding implies that, in societies where intra-sentential (but not inter-sentential) code-switching is a common social practice, inter-sentential code-switching may serve as signs of a bilingual child&#x27;s language-dominance status.

===Filipino and English===

Code-switching between English and Tagalog (Filipino), as well as English and other native languages, is very widespread in the Philippines. Known generally as Taglish, it has become the de facto lingua franca among the urbanized and/or educated middle class. It is largely considered the &quot;normal acceptable conversation style of speaking and writing&quot; in informal settings. It is so widespread that a non-native speaker can be identified easily because they predominantly use pure Tagalog, whereas a native speaker would switch freely with English.

Roger Thompson’s research it suggests that the interactions between Tagalog and English depend on what is taking place. In the classroom teachers prefer students to use English. When in media the Philippines tends to prefer using Tagalog over English but in smaller social interactions people use their local dialect over both.

According to the linguist Maria Lourdes S. Bautista, there are two contrasting types of code-switching in the Philippines: deficiency-driven and proficiency-driven. Deficiency-driven code-switching is when a person is not competent in one language and thus has to switch back to the language they are more familiar with. This is common among younger children, as in the example below given by Bautista:

Proficiency-driven code-switching, on the other hand, is when a person is fully competent in both languages being used and can switch between them easily. It is the main type of code-switching in the islands. The example below is given by Bautista, taken from an interview with the television journalist Jessica Soho:

Proficiency-driven code-switching is characterized by frequent switching of the Matrix Language (ML) between Tagalog and English, demonstrating the high proficiency of the speakers in both languages. There are also a wide range of strategies involved, including: the formation of bilingual verbs by the addition of prefixes, suffixes, and infixes (e.g. Nagsa-&quot;sweat&quot; ako = &quot;I was sweating&quot;); switching at the morphological, word, phrasal, or clausal levels; and the use of system morphemes (like enclitics, conjunctions, etc.) within long stretches of ML content; and even the inversion of the verb–subject–object word order of Tagalog into the subject-verb-object order of English.

According to Bautista, the reason for this type of code-switching is what she termed &quot;communicative efficiency&quot;, wherein a speaker can &quot;convey meaning using the most accurate, expressive, or succinct lexical items available to them.&quot; The linguist Rosalina Morales Goulet also enumerated several reasons for this type of code-switching. They are: &quot;for precision, for transition, for comic effect, for atmosphere, to bridge or create social distance, for snob appeal, and for secrecy.&quot;

===French and Tamil===
This example of switching from French to Tamil comes from ethnographer Sonia Das&#x27;s work with immigrants from Jaffna, Sri Lanka, to Quebec. Selvamani, who moved from Sri Lanka to Quebec as a child and now identifies as Québécois, speaks to Das in French. When Selvamani&#x27;s sister, Mala, laughs, Selvamani switches to Tamil to ask Mala why she is laughing. After this aside, Selvamani continues to speak in French. Selvamani also uses the word &quot;tsé&quot; (&quot;you know&quot;, contraction of &quot;tu sais&quot;) and the expression &quot;je me pas poigner&quot; (&quot;I will not be caught&quot;), which are not standard French but are typical of the working-class Montreal dialect Joual.

===Hopi and Tewa===
Researcher Paul Kroskrity offers the following example of code-switching by three elder Arizona Tewa men, who are trilingual in Tewa, Hopi, and English. They are discussing the selection of a site for a new high school in the eastern Hopi Reservation. In their two-hour conversation, the three men primarily speak Tewa; however, when Speaker A addresses the Hopi Reservation as a whole, he code-switches to Hopi. His speaking Hopi when talking of Hopi-related matters is a conversational norm in the Arizona Tewa speech community. Kroskrity reports that these Arizona Tewa men, who culturally identify themselves as Hopi &quot;and&quot; Tewa, use the different languages to linguistically construct and maintain their discrete ethnic identities.
===Latin and Irish===
Irish annals were written in Ireland between the 8th and 17th centuries by Christian monks and priests. These were fluent in both Irish and Latin and wrote the annals in both languages, often switching between them within a single sentence.

An example is given below, from the 9th-century Martyrology of Óengus that gives a spurious etymology of the prince Connadil&#x27;s name:
According to the scholar Nike Stam, &quot;Many switches consisted of inserted Latin fragments: short phrases or single words. Some of these Latin phrases appeared to be of a formulaic nature and seemed to have originated in the medieval catena tradition. They are often used to provide cross-references to other sources or to combine conflicting opinions on a text. These are phrases like &quot;ut in proverbio dicitur [&quot;as is said in the proverb&quot;]&quot; and &quot;ut ferunt peritii [&quot;as experience bears out&quot;]&quot;. Most of the language switches, however, consisted of what Muysken called alternation: longer fragments like clauses or long phrases. This type of code-switching has been linked to bilingualism in societies that are strongly diglossic, and thus suggests that the scribes compiling and writing the glosses preferred to use their two languages according to specific norms.&quot;

===Spanish and English===
Researcher Ana Celia Zentella offers this example from her work with Puerto Rican Spanish-English bilingual speakers in New York City. In this example, Marta and her younger sister, Lolita, speak Spanish and English with Zentella outside of their apartment building. Zentella explains that the children of the predominantly Puerto Rican neighbourhood speak both English and Spanish: &quot;Within the children&#x27;s network, English predominated, but code-switching from English to Spanish occurred once every three minutes, on average.&quot;

<text>An eyepatch is a small patch that is worn in front of one eye. It may be a cloth patch attached around the head by an elastic band or by a string, an adhesive bandage, or a plastic device which is clipped to a pair of glasses. It is often worn by people to cover a lost, infected, or injured eye, but it also has a therapeutic use in kids for the treatment of amblyopia. Eyepatches used to block light while sleeping are referred to as a sleep mask.

An eyepad or eye pad is a soft medical dressing that can be applied over an eye to protect it. It is not necessarily the same as an eyepatch.

==History==
In the years before advanced medicine and surgery, eyepatches were common for people who had a lost or injured eye. They were particularly prevalent among members of dangerous occupations, such as soldiers and sailors who could lose an eye in battle. While stereotypically associated with pirates, there is no evidence to suggest the historical accuracy of eye patch wearing pirates before several popular novels of the 19th century (see Association with pirates below).

==Medical uses==

===Amblyopia===
Eye patching is used in the orthoptic management of children at risk of lazy eye (amblyopia), especially strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia. These conditions can cause visual suppression of areas of the dissimilar images by the brain such as to avoid diplopia, resulting in a loss of visual acuity in the suppressed eye and in extreme cases in blindness in an otherwise functional eye. Patching the good eye forces the amblyopic eye to function, thereby causing vision in that eye to be retained. It is important to perform &quot;near activities&quot; (such as reading or handiwork) when patched, thereby exercising active, attentive vision.

A study provided evidence that children treated for amblyopia with eye patching had lower self-perception of social acceptance. To prevent a child from being socially marginalized by their peers due to wearing an eye patch, atropine eye drops may be used instead. This induces temporary blurring in the treated eye.

It has been pointed out that the penalization of one eye by means of patching or atropine drops does not provide the necessary conditions to develop or improve binocular vision. Recently, efforts have been made to propose alternative treatments of amblyopia that do allow for the improvement of binocular sight, for example, using binasal occlusion or partially frosted spectacles in place of any eye patch, using alternating occlusion goggles or using methods of perceptual learning based on video games or virtual reality games for enhancing binocular vision.

A 2014 Cochrane Review sought to determine the effectiveness of occlusion treatment on patients with sensory deprivation amblyopia, however no trials were found eligible to be included in the review. However, it is suggested that good outcomes from occlusion treatment for sensory deprivation amblyopia rely on compliance with the treatment.

===Extraocular muscle palsy===
To initially relieve double vision (diplopia) caused by an extra-ocular muscle palsy, an eye care professional may recommend using an eyepatch. This can help to relieve the dizziness, vertigo and nausea that are associated with this form of double vision.

==Use by aircraft pilots==
Aircraft pilots used an eye patch, or close one eye to preserve night vision when there was disparity in the light intensity within or outside their aircraft, such as when flying at night over brightly lit cities, so that one eye could look out, and the other would be adjusted for the dim lighting of the cockpit to read unlit instruments and maps. Some military pilots have worn a lead-lined or gold-lined eyepatch, to protect against blindness in both eyes, in the event of a nuclear blast or laser weapon attack.

Eyepatches are not currently used by military personnel; modern technology has provided an array of other means to preserve and enhance night vision, including red-light and low-level white lights, and night vision devices.

==Association with pirates==

Ex-sailors ashore sometimes wore an eye patch to cover the loss of an eye, but pirates rarely wore eye patches while aboard ships. There were some exceptions, including Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalahimah, a well-known pirate of the Persian Gulf, who wore an eye patch after losing an eye in battle. 

Medical texts have referred to the eye patch as a &quot;pirate&#x27;s patch&quot; and, writing in the Minnesota Academy of Sciences Journal in 1934, Charles Sheard of the Mayo foundation pointed out that by &quot;wearing a patch (The pirate&#x27;s patch) over one eye, it will keep the covered eye in a state of readiness and adaptation for night vision&quot;. This technique was explored during WWII by institutes such as the United States Navy. It has been suggested that pirates before electric lighting wore eyepatches to keep one eye adjusted to darkness ahead of a boarding operation, so that they would be ready to fight below deck where the lighting was poor. This idea was tested in an episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot; in 2007 and found to be plausible, but this application has never been documented in any historical naval manual.

<text>Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), also known as Swiss-type agammaglobulinemia, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the disturbed development of functional T cells and B cells caused by numerous genetic mutations that result in differing clinical presentations. SCID involves defective antibody response due to either direct involvement with B lymphocytes or through improper B lymphocyte activation due to non-functional T-helper cells. Consequently, both &quot;arms&quot; (B cells and T cells) of the adaptive immune system are impaired due to a defect in one of several possible genes. SCID is the most severe form of primary immunodeficiencies, and there are now at least seven different known genes in which mutations lead to a form of SCID. It is also known as the bubble boy disease and bubble baby disease because its victims are extremely vulnerable to infectious diseases and some of them, such as David Vetter, have become famous for living in a sterile environment. SCID is the result of an immune system so highly compromised that it is considered almost absent.

SCID patients are usually affected by severe bacterial, viral, or fungal infections early in life and often present with interstitial lung disease, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Ear infections, recurrent &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; (previously &quot;carinii&quot;) pneumonia, and profuse oral candidiasis commonly occur. These babies, if untreated, usually die within one year due to severe, recurrent infections unless they have undergone successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy in clinical trials.

==Classification==
==Diagnosis==
Early diagnosis of SCID is usually difficult due to the need for advanced screening techniques. Several symptoms may indicate a possibility of SCID in a child, such as a family history of infant death, chronic coughs, hyperinflated lungs, and persistent infections. A full blood lymphocyte count is often considered a reliable manner of diagnosing SCID, but higher lymphocyte counts in childhood may influence results. Clinical diagnosis based on genetic defects is also a possible diagnostic procedure that has been implemented in the UK.

Some SCID can be detected by sequencing fetal DNA if a known history of the disease exists. Otherwise, SCID is not diagnosed until about six months of age, usually indicated by recurrent infections. The delay in detection is because newborns carry their mothers&#x27; antibodies for the first few weeks of life and SCID babies look normal.

===Newborn screening===
Several countries test all newborns for SCID as a part of routine newborn screening. As of September 2022, the known percentage of newborns screened has increased throughout the world with 100% in the United States, 100% in Australia 78% in Europe, 32% in Latin America, 26% in the Middle East and North Africa, 13% in Asia-Pacific, and 0% in Central America. The introduction of newborn screenings and genetic testing in many countries has allowed early detection and treatment before the development of severe infections, which progressively improved the five-year survival rate for newborns with SCID to around 90%. All states in the U.S. are performing screening for SCID in newborns using real-time quantitative PCR to measure the concentration of T-cell receptor excision circles.

==Treatment==
The most common treatment for SCID is bone marrow transplantation, which has been very successful using either a matched related or unrelated donor, or a half-matched donor, who would be either parent. The half-matched type of transplant is called haploidentical. Haploidentical bone marrow transplants require the donor marrow to be depleted of all mature T cells to avoid the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Consequently, a functional immune system takes longer to develop in a patient who receives a haploidentical bone marrow transplant compared to a patient receiving a matched transplant. The first reported case of successful transplant was a Spanish child patient who was interned in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 1982, in New York City. David Vetter, the original &quot;bubble boy&quot;, had one of the first transplantations also, but eventually died because of an unscreened virus, Epstein-Barr (tests were not available at the time), in his newly transplanted bone marrow from his sister, an unmatched bone marrow donor. Today, transplants done in the first three months of life have a high success rate. Physicians have also had some success with &quot;in utero&quot; transplants done before the child is born and also by using cord blood which is rich in stem cells. &quot;In utero&quot; transplants allow for the fetus to develop a functional immune system in the sterile environment of the uterus; however complications such as GVHD would be difficult to detect or treat if they were to occur.

More recently gene therapy has been attempted as an alternative to the bone marrow transplant. Transduction of the missing gene to hematopoietic stem cells using viral vectors is being tested in ADA SCID and X-linked SCID. In 1990, four-year-old Ashanthi DeSilva became the first patient to undergo successful gene therapy. Researchers collected samples of DeSilva&#x27;s blood, isolated some of her white blood cells, and used a retrovirus to insert a healthy adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into them. These cells were then injected back into her body, and began to express a normal enzyme. This, augmented by weekly injections of ADA, corrected her deficiency. However, the concurrent treatment of ADA injections may impair the success of gene therapy, since transduced cells will have no selective advantage to proliferate if untransduced cells can survive in the presence of the injected ADA.

In 2000, a gene therapy &quot;success&quot; resulted in SCID patients with a functional immune system. These trials were stopped when it was discovered that two of ten patients in one trial had developed leukemia resulting from the insertion of the gene-carrying retrovirus near an oncogene. In 2007, four of the ten patients have developed leukemias. Work aimed at improving gene therapy is now focusing on modifying the viral vector to reduce the likelihood of oncogenesis and using zinc-finger nucleases to further target gene insertion. No leukemia cases have yet been seen in trials of ADA-SCID, which does not involve the &quot;gamma c&quot; gene that may be oncogenic when expressed by a retrovirus.

From the treatments of Ashanthi DeSilva in 1990, which is considered gene therapy&#x27;s first success until 2014, around 60 patients were treated for either ADA-SCID or X-SCID using retroviruses vectors. As previously mentioned, the occurrence of leukemia cases forced researchers to make changes to improve safety. In 2019, a new method using an altered version of the HIV virus as a lentivirus vector was reported in the treatment of eight children with X-SCID, and in 2021 the same method was used in 50 children with ADA-SCID, obtaining positive results in 48 of them.

There are also some non-curative methods for treating SCID. Reverse isolation involves the use of laminar air flow and mechanical barriers to avoid physical contact with others in order to isolate the patient from any harmful pathogens present in the external environment. Another non-curative treatment for patients with ADA-SCID is enzyme replacement therapy, in which the patient is injected with polyethyleneglycol-coupled adenosine deaminase (PEG-ADA), which metabolizes the toxic substrates of the ADA enzyme and prevents their accumulation. Treatment with PEG-ADA may be used to restore T cell function in the short term, enough to clear any existing infections before proceeding with curative treatment such as a bone marrow transplant.

==Epidemiology==
The most commonly quoted figure for the prevalence of SCID is around one in 100,000 births, although this is regarded by some to be an underestimate of the true prevalence; some estimates predict that the prevalence rate is as high as one in 50,000 live births. A figure of about one in 65,000 live births has been reported for Australia.

Due to the particular genetic nature of SCID, a higher prevalence may be found in certain regions and associated cultures where higher rates of consanguineous mating occur (i.e. mating between blood relatives). A Moroccan study reported that consanguineous parenting was observed in 75% of the families of Moroccan SCID patients.

Recent studies indicate that one in every 2,500 children in the Navajo population inherit severe combined immunodeficiency. This condition is a significant cause of illness and death among Navajo children. Ongoing research reveals a similar genetic pattern among the related Apache people.

==SCID in animals==

SCID mice were and still are used in disease, vaccine, and transplant research, especially as animal models for testing the safety of new vaccines or therapeutic agents in people with weakened immune system. SCID mice also serve as a useful animal model in the study of the human immune system and its interactions with disease, infections, and cancer. For example, normal strains of mice can be lethally irradiated, killing all rapidly dividing cells. These mice then receive bone marrow transplantation from SCID donors, allowing engraftment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to occur. This method can be used to study whether T cell-lacking mice can perform hematopoiesis after receiving human PBMC.

A recessive gene, with clinical signs similar to the human condition, affects the Arabian horse. The condition remains a fatal disease, as the horse inevitably succumbs to an opportunistic infection within the first four to six months of life. However, carriers, who themselves are not affected by the disease, can be detected with a DNA test. Therefore, careful breeding practices can avoid the risk of an affected foal being produced.

Another animal with well-characterized SCID pathology is the dog. There are two known forms: an X-linked SCID in Basset Hounds that has similar ontology to X-SCID in humans and an autosomal recessive form seen in one line of Jack Russell Terriers that is similar to SCID in Arabian horses and mice.

<text>The common chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), or simply the chiffchaff, is a common and widespread leaf warbler which breeds in open woodlands throughout northern and temperate Europe and the Palearctic.

It is a migratory passerine which winters in southern and western Europe, southern Asia and north Africa. Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named onomatopoeically for its simple &quot;chiff-chaff&quot; song. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends his territory against rivals, and attacks potential predators.

A small insectivorous bird, it is subject to predation by mammals, such as cats and mustelids, and birds, particularly hawks of the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;. Its large range and population mean that its status is secure, although one subspecies is probably extinct.

==Taxonomy==

The British naturalist Gilbert White was one of the first people to separate the similar-looking common chiffchaff, willow warbler and wood warbler by their songs, as detailed in 1789 in &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot;, but the common chiffchaff was first formally described as &quot;Sylvia collybita&quot; by French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1817 in his &quot;Nouveau Dictionnaire d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot;. The type locality is the French region of Normandy.

Described by German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826, the genus &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; contains about 80 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and yellowish, white or buff below. The genus was formerly part of the Old World warbler family Sylvidae, but has now been split off as a separate family Phylloscopidae. The chiffchaff&#x27;s closest relatives, other than former subspecies, are a group of leaf warblers which similarly lack crown stripes, a yellow rump or obvious wing bars; they include the willow, Bonelli&#x27;s, wood and plain leaf warblers.

An old synonym, used for the chiffchaff was &quot;Phylloscopus rufus&quot; (Bechstein).

The common chiffchaff has three still commonly accepted subspecies, together with some from the Iberian Peninsula, the Canary Islands, and the Caucasus which are now more often treated as full species.

===Subspecies===

*&quot;P. c. collybita&quot;, the nominate form, breeds in Europe east to Poland and Bulgaria, and is described below. It mainly winters in the south of its breeding range around the Mediterranean and in North Africa. It has been expanding its range northwards into Scandinavia since 1970 and close to the southern edge of the range of &quot;P. c. abietinus&quot;.
*&quot;P. c. abietinus&quot; occurs in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and winters from southeastern Europe and northeastern Africa east to Iraq and western Iran. It is intermediate in appearance between &quot;P. c. tristis&quot; and &quot;P. c. collybita&quot;, being grey-washed olive-green above with a pale yellow supercilium, and underparts whiter than in &quot;P. c. collybita&quot;, but it has very similar vocalisations to the nominate subspecies. Due to individual variation, it can be difficult to reliably separate &quot;P. c. abietinus&quot; and &quot;P. c. collybita&quot; outside their main breeding and wintering ranges. Some common chiffchaffs in the Middle East are browner and have a more disyllabic &quot;swee-hu&quot; call than &quot;P. c. abietinus&quot;, and may belong to a poorly known taxon &quot;brevirostris&quot;; further research is needed to clarify the affinities of this form.
*&quot;P. (c.) tristis&quot;, the Siberian chiffchaff, breeds in Siberia east of the Pechora River and winters in the lower Himalayas. It is also regularly recorded in western Europe in winter, and it is likely that the numbers involved have been underestimated due to uncertainties over identification criteria, lack of good data and recording policies (Sweden and Finland only accept trapped birds). It is a dull subspecies, grey or brownish above and whitish below, with little yellow in the plumage, and the buff-white supercilium is often longer than in the western subspecies. It has a higher pitched &quot;suitsistsuisit&quot; song and a short high-pitched &quot;cheet&quot; call. It is sometimes considered to be a full species due to its distinctive plumage and vocalisations, being similar to &quot;P. s. sindianus&quot; in these respects. Nominate &quot;P. c. collybita&quot; and &quot;P. c. tristis&quot; do not recognize each other&#x27;s songs. Pending resolution of the status of &quot;P. (c.) fulvescens&quot;, which is found where the ranges of &quot;P. c. abietinus&quot; and &quot;P. c. tristis&quot; connect and may or may not be a hybrid between these, &quot;tristis&quot; is maintained in &quot;P. collybita&quot;.
===Former subspecies===
* &quot;P. ibericus&quot;, the Iberian chiffchaff is brighter, greener on the rump, and yellower below than &quot;P. collybita&quot;, and has a &quot;&quot; song. It was initially named &quot;P. brehmii&quot;, but the type specimen of that taxon is not an Iberian chiffchaff. This species is found in Portugal and Spain, west of a line stretching roughly from the western Pyrenees via the mountains of central Spain to the Mediterranean; the Iberian and common chiffchaffs co-occur in a narrow band along this line. Apart from the northernmost section, the precise course of the contact zone is not well documented. A long-distance migrant, this species winters in western Africa. It differs from &quot;P. c. collybita&quot; in vocalisations, external morphology, and mtDNA sequences. There is hybridization in the contact zone, almost always between male &quot;P. ibericus&quot; and female &quot;P. c. collybita&quot;, and hybrids apparently show much decreased fitness; hybrid females appear to be sterile according to Haldane&#x27;s Rule. Regarding the latter aspect, the Iberian chiffchaff apparently is the oldest lineage of chiffchaffs and quite distinct from the common chiffchaff.
*&quot;P. canariensis&quot;, the Canary Islands chiffchaff is a non-migratory species formerly occurring on the major Canary Islands, which is differentiated from &quot;P. collybita&quot; by morphology, vocalisations and genetic characteristics, and, of course, is not sympatric with any other chiffchaffs. The nominate western subspecies &quot;P. c. canariensis&quot; of El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria is smaller than common chiffchaff, and has shorter, rounder wings. It is olive-brown above and has a buff breast and flanks; it has a rich deep &quot;&quot; song, and a call similar to the nominate race. The eastern &quot;P. c. exsul&quot; of Lanzarote and possibly Fuerteventura is paler above and less rufous below than its western relative, and had a harsher call; it might have been a distinct species, but it became extinct in 1986 at latest, probably much earlier. The reasons for its extinction are unclear, but it appears always to have been scarce and localised, occurring only in the Haria Valley of Lanzarote.
*&quot;P. sindianus&quot;, the mountain chiffchaff, is found in the Caucasus (&quot;P. s. lorenzii&quot;) and Himalayas (&quot;P. s. sindianus&quot;), and is an altitudinal migrant, moving to lower levels in winter. The nominate subspecies is similar to &quot;P. c. tristis&quot;, but with a finer darker bill, browner upperparts and buff flanks; its song is almost identical to &quot;P. collybita&quot;, but the call is a weak &quot;&quot;. &quot;P. s. lorenzii&quot; is warmer and darker brown than the nominate race; it is sympatric with common chiffchaff in a small area in the Western Caucasus, but interbreeding occurs rarely, if ever. The mountain chiffchaff differs from &quot;tristis&quot; in vocalisations, external morphology, and mtDNA sequences. Its two subspecies appear to be distinct vocally, and also show some difference in mtDNA sequences; they are maintained at subspecies rank pending further research.

===Etymology===
The common chiffchaff&#x27;s English name is onomatopoeic, referring to the repetitive &#x27; song of the European subspecies. There are similar names in some other European languages, such as the Dutch , the German , Welsh and Finnish . The binomial name is of Greek origin; &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; comes from &#x27;/ &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;&quot;/ &quot;to look at&quot; or &quot;to see&quot;, since this genus comprises species that spend much of their time feeding in trees, while &quot;collybita&quot; is a corruption of κολλυβιστής (&quot;kollubistḗs&quot;) &quot;money changer&quot;, the song being likened to the jingling of coins. In some languages their tree-dwelling habit is hinted in the vernacular name. For example, in Swedish the common chiffchaff is called &quot;gransångare&quot;, a compound of &quot;gran&quot; (i.e. &quot;spruce&quot;) and &quot;sångare&quot;, meaning both &quot;singer&quot; and Old World warbler.

==Description==
The common chiffchaff is a small, dumpy, long leaf warbler. The male weighs 7–8 grammes (0.28–0.31 oz), and the female 6–7 grammes (0.25–0.28 oz). The spring adult of the western nominate subspecies &quot; P. c. collybita&quot; has brown-washed dull green upperparts, off-white underparts becoming yellowish on the flanks, and a short whitish supercilium. It has dark legs, a fine dark bill, and short primary projection (extension of the flight feathers beyond the folded wing). As the plumage wears, it gets duller and browner, and the yellow on the flanks tends to be lost, but after the breeding season there is a prolonged complete moult before migration. The newly fledged juvenile is browner above than the adult, with yellow-white underparts, but moults about 10 weeks after acquiring its first plumage. After moulting, both the adult and the juvenile have brighter and greener upperparts and a paler supercilium.

This warbler gets its name from its simple distinctive song, a repetitive cheerful &#x27;. This song is one of the first avian signs that spring has returned. Its call is a &#x27;, less disyllabic than the &#x27; of the willow warbler or &#x27; of the western Bonelli&#x27;s warbler.

The song differs from that of the Iberian chiffchaff, which has a shorter &quot;&quot;. However, mixed singers occur in the hybridisation zone and elsewhere, and can be difficult to allocate to species.

When not singing, the common chiffchaff can be difficult to distinguish from other leaf warblers with greenish upperparts and whitish underparts, particularly the willow warbler. However, that species has a longer primary projection, a sleeker, brighter appearance and generally pale legs. Bonelli&#x27;s warbler (&quot;P. bonelli)&quot; might be confused with the common chiffchaff subspecies &quot;tristis&quot;, but it has a plain face and green in the wings. The common chiffchaff also has rounded wings in flight, and a diagnostic tail movement consisting of a dip, then sidewards wag, that distinguishes it from other &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; warblers and gives rise to the name &quot;tailwagger&quot; in India.

Perhaps the greatest challenge is distinguishing non-singing birds of the nominate subspecies from Iberian chiffchaff in the field. In Great Britain and the Netherlands, all accepted records of vagrant Iberian chiffchaffs relate to singing males.

==Distribution and habitat==
The common chiffchaff breeds across Europe and Asia east to eastern Siberia and north to about 70°N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran. It is migratory, but it is one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, bracken, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the willow warbler (&quot;P. trochilus&quot;) prefers younger trees, while the wood warbler (&quot;P. sibilatrix&quot;) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies &quot;abietinus&quot; and &quot;tristis&quot;, so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.

==Behaviour==

===Territory===

The male common chiffchaff is highly territorial during the breeding season, with a core territory typically across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds may also be attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the stoat if they approach the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the Eurasian jay. His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears to be used to advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a paternity guard strategy.

Beyond the core territory, there is a larger feeding range which is variable in size, but typically ten or more times the area of the breeding territory. It is believed that the female has a larger feeding range than the male. After breeding has finished, this species abandons its territory, and may join small flocks including other warblers prior to migration.

===Breeding===

The male common chiffchaff returns to its breeding territory two or three weeks before the female and immediately starts singing to establish ownership and attract a female. When a female is located, the male will use a slow butterfly-like flight as part of the courtship ritual, but once a pair-bond has been established, other females will be driven from the territory. The male has little involvement in the nesting process other than defending the territory. The female&#x27;s nest is built on or near the ground in a concealed site in brambles, nettles or other dense low vegetation. The domed nest has a side entrance, and is constructed from coarse plant material such as dead leaves and grass, with finer material used on the interior before the addition of a lining of feathers. The typical nest is high and across.

The clutch is two to seven (normally five or six) cream-coloured eggs which have tiny ruddy, purple or blackish spots and are about long and across. They are incubated by the female for 13–14 days before hatching as naked, blind altricial chicks. The female broods and feeds the chicks for another 14–15 days until they fledge. The male rarely participates in feeding, although this sometimes occurs, especially when bad weather limits insect supplies or if the female disappears. After fledging, the young stay in the vicinity of the nest for three to four weeks, and are fed by and roost with the female, although these interactions reduce after approximately the first 14 days. In the north of the range there is only time to raise one brood, due to the short summer, but a second brood is common in central and southern areas.

Although pairs stay together during the breeding season and polygamy is uncommon, even if the male and female return to the same site in the following year there is no apparent recognition or fidelity. Interbreeding with other species, other than those formerly considered as subspecies of &quot;P. collybita&quot;, is rare, but a few examples are known of hybridisation with the willow warbler. Such hybrids give mixed songs, but the latter alone is not proof of interspecific breeding.

===Feeding===
Like most Old World warblers, this small species is insectivorous, moving restlessly through foliage or briefly hovering. It has been recorded as taking insects, mainly flies, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It will take the eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths, particularly those of the winter moth. The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight.

==Predators and threats==
As with most small birds, mortality in the first year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.

The common chiffchaff is occasionally a host of brood parasitic cuckoos, including the common and Horsfield&#x27;s cuckoos, but it recognises and rejects non-mimetic eggs and is therefore only rarely successfully brood-parasitised. Like other passerine birds, the common chiffchaff can also acquire intestinal nematode parasites and external ticks.

The main effect of humans on this species is indirect, through woodland clearance which affects the habitat, predation by cats, and collisions with windows, buildings and cars. Only the first of these has the potential to seriously affect populations, but given the huge geographical spread of &quot;P. c. abietinus&quot; and &quot;P. c. tristis&quot;, and woodland conservation policies in the range of &quot;P. c. collybita&quot;, the chiffchaff&#x27;s future seems assured.

==Status==
The common chiffchaff has an enormous range, with an estimated global extent of 10 million square kilometres (3.8 million square miles) and a population of 60–120 million individuals in Europe alone. Although global population trends have not been quantified, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (that is, declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as &quot;least concern&quot;.

None of the major subspecies is under threat, but &quot;exsul&quot;, as noted above, is probably extinct. There is a slow population increase of common chiffchaff in the Czech Republic. The range of at least &quot;P. c. collybita&quot; seems to be expanding, with northward advances in Scotland, Norway and Sweden and a large population increase in Denmark.

<text>The Iberian chiffchaff (Phylloscopus ibericus) is a species of leaf warbler endemic to Portugal, Spain and North Africa, west of a line stretching roughly from the western Pyrenees via the mountains of central Spain to the Atlantic.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The name &quot;chiffchaff&quot; is onomatopoeic, referring to the repetitive &quot;chiff-chaff&quot; song of the common chiffchaff (&quot;Phylloscopus collybita&quot;). There are similar names in some other European languages, such as the Dutch &quot;Tjiftjaf&quot;, the German &quot;Zilpzalp&quot; and Welsh &quot;siff-saff&quot;.
The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific &quot;ibericus&quot; is Latin for &quot;Iberian&quot;.

Previously the Iberian chiffchaff was considered as a subspecies of the common chiffchaff. As of 2016, it is recognised as a separate species under the name &quot;Phylloscopus ibericus&quot; for the following reasons (compared to the common chiffchaff):
* Brighter in colour
* Greener rump
* Yellower below
* Vocalisations different
* mtDNA sequence divergence

Due to current research on these species, it has been discovered that Iberian Chiffchaff is the most divergent among the members of the chiffchaff species complex. The Iberian Chiffchaff is slightly larger and paler, with more olive-colored plumage.

In past, erroneously listed as &quot;Phylloscopus brehmii&quot;.

<text>The mountain chiffchaff or eastern chiffchaff (Phylloscopus sindianus) is a species of leaf warbler found in the Caucasus (&quot;P. s. lorenzii&quot;) and Himalayas (&quot;P. s. sindianus&quot;), and is an altitudinal migrant, moving to lower levels in winter. The nominate subspecies is similar to the Siberian chiffchaff, but with a finer darker bill, browner upperparts and buff flanks; its song is almost identical to the common chiffchaff, but the call is a weak &quot;psew&quot;. &quot;P. s. lorenzii&quot; is warmer and darker brown than the nominate race; it is sympatric with common chiffchaff in a small area in the Western Caucasus, but interbreeding occurs rarely, if ever. The mountain chiffchaff differs from &quot;tristis&quot; in vocalisations, external morphology and mtDNA sequences. Its two subspecies appear to be distinct vocally, and also show some difference in mtDNA sequences.

<text>Siberian chiffchaff (&quot;Phylloscopus collybita tristis&quot;) is a leaf-warbler which is usually considered a subspecies of the common chiffchaff, but may be a species in its own right.

==Range==

Siberian chiffchaff breeds in Siberia east of the Pechora River and winters in the lower Himalayas.

===Status in Europe and North America===

It is also regularly recorded in western Europe in winter, and it is likely that the numbers involved have been underestimated due to uncertainties over identification criteria, lack of good data and recording policies (Sweden and Finland only accept trapped birds).

Because of their unfamiliar appearance, British records in the 1950s and 1960s were originally thought to be greenish warblers, and accepted as such by BBRC, the national rarities committee, until the records were reviewed in the 1980s.

A Gambell, Alaska bird discovered by Alexander Lin-Moore and Ethan Goodman on June 5, 2015 and seen by many birders would be the 4th (or 5th?) reported in North America.

==Appearance and vocalisations==

It is a dull bird, grey or brownish above and whitish below, with little yellow in the plumage, and the buff-white supercilium is often longer than in the western subspecies. It has a higher pitched &quot;suitsistsuisit&quot; song and a short high-pitched &quot;cheet&quot; call. It is sometimes considered to be a full species due to its distinctive plumage and vocalisations, being similar to &quot;P. s. sindianus&quot; in these respects.

==Taxonomy==

Common chiffchaffs (of the nominate race) and Siberian chiffchaffs do not recognize each other&#x27;s songs. Pending resolution of the status of the form &quot;fulvescens&quot;, which is found where the ranges of common chiffchaff (of the race &quot;abietinus&quot;) and Siberian chiffchaff connect and may or may not be a hybrid between these, &quot;tristis&quot; is maintained in &quot;P. collybita&quot; by most checklists.

<text>Lost Boys (1992) is a horror novel by American author Orson Scott Card. The premise of the novel revolves around the daily lives of a Mormon family, and the challenges they face after a move to North Carolina. The story primarily follows the family&#x27;s troubles at work, church, and the oldest child Stevie&#x27;s difficulty fitting in at school, which lead to him becoming increasingly withdrawn.

Dealing with themes such as religion and the nature of good and evil, the novel is an expansion of Card&#x27;s short story &quot;Lost Boys&quot;. The plot of the short story is similar to the plot of the novel but Card assumes the role of the protagonist, Fletcher, leading the story to appear autobiographical. After receiving criticism for the story being &quot;offensive&quot; and appropriating the grief of losing a child, Card put a disclaimer at the end of the short story and wrote the novel in the third-person. The novel received praise for its &quot;easy and natural prose&quot; and its genuine and uplifting themes. Eugene England criticized the novel for its theology and the manner in which it deals with &quot;religious, theological, and moral issues&quot;, stating that Card is at his best when he writes science fiction; however, he admitted that Card is a good storyteller. The novel won the 1992 Association of Mormon Letters Award for Best Novel.

==Plot==
The novel, set in 1983, revolves around Step Fletcher, a game programmer, who invented a fictional game for Atari 8-bit computers called &quot;Hacker Snack&quot;, and his family. Step, a devout Mormon, moves his pregnant wife DeAnne and their three children, including seven-year-old Stevie, from Indiana to Steuben, North Carolina, so he can start a new job as a technical writer. In addition to struggles at his new job with unpleasant and immoral bosses and coworkers, the Fletchers&#x27; new house is periodically invaded by hordes of different types of insects. Bappy, the elderly father of the owner of the rented house, is always ready to lend a hand with things. Step quits his job right before DeAnne gives birth to a baby with special needs. 

After the move, Step&#x27;s son Stevie becomes withdrawn, playing only with his imaginary friends in the garden and on his computer. They take him to a psychiatrist, who speculates that the family&#x27;s religion could be causing Stevie&#x27;s problems, offending Step. Step and DeAnne notice that the names of Stevie&#x27;s imaginary friends are the same as the names of young boys who are disappearing. Stevie knows the boys&#x27; nicknames, which are not common knowledge. They notify the police, and a detective questions Stevie, concluding that a serial killer must exist for them to be all connected through Stevie. 

Step notices that the video game that Stevie uses to play with his imaginary friends has graphics that are beyond anything that could actually run on the computer and discovers that the game has no cartridge. On the 22nd of December, Bappy arrives and fits the Christmas lights for them and lingers for quite some time while DeAnn and Step take their infant to the doctor. On Christmas Eve, Stevie brings his friends into the house to introduce them to his parents and to celebrate Christmas. Stevie reveals that now that he is like them, he can make them visible to others. He explained that after confronting Bappy&#x27;s connection to the missing boys, Bappy murdered him and buried his body in the underspace below the house, which also contained the graves of the other boys. Step and DeAnne bid Stevie farewell. Bappy is arrested and charged with the murder of the boys. Years later, Robbie and Betsy regard their elder brother like a legend and the family waits to unite with their lost child once again in the afterlife.

==Themes and motifs==
Robert Bird described &quot;Lost Boys&quot; as a postmodern detective fiction because it explores multiple realities and aspects of the supernatural. Specifically, it deals with the ontological concerns of good and evil. The novel seeks to address what should be done when confronted with evil. Evil in the novel is described as supernatural and existing beyond the narrative as evident in the prologue which is also independent of the narrative. Throughout the novel, Step attempts to confront evil, suggesting that the most important way to confront evil is to &quot;identify and name sin&quot;. Card uses Abinadi in the Book of Mormon as an example, explaining that it is better to die than knowing something bad is happening yet doing nothing about it. However, it is only the purity of Stevie that allows him to recognize the true evil in the novel in Steuben. Stevie sacrifices his life to identify it like Abinadi in the Book of Mormon and Stephen in the New Testament. This work portrays the Mormon theological belief about the eternal nature of evil, that it exists on its own, and portrays the struggle against it.

Other themes in the novel include what Michael Collings calls &quot;The Epick of Mormonism&quot;. Card interweaves religion throughout the novel which plays a large part in the beliefs and morals of the family and the novel. More prominent than Mormonism is the theme of the American reality as the family lives in a world surrounded by deception, greed, and evil. The community to which the Fletchers belong does not uplift them, but hurts them, exemplified by a fanatical church member, a cruel elementary school teacher, a pedophilic coworker, and a serial killer landlord. It is only at the end of the novel that the Fletchers achieve the sense of community that they were seeking. Stevie is the vehicle for which Card mourns his own &quot;lost boy&quot;, his son, yet also represents innocence and purity on a larger scale. Michael Collings argues that the ending of the novel transitions it from a &quot;realistic&quot; novel to a &quot;mythopoeic&quot; one.

Video games are common motifs found in Card&#x27;s writing that often represent the complex, video game-like quality of life that needs to be navigated. In &quot;Lost Boys&quot;, Step Fletcher is a video game designer and a part of the novel&#x27;s main plot revolves around Stevie playing a mysterious video game.

==Background and publication==
Like many of Card&#x27;s works, the novel is an expansion of a short story, his &quot;Lost Boys&quot;, which can be found in his short story compilation &quot;Maps in a Mirror&quot;. According to Card, his original idea for the short story was inspired by Stephen King&#x27;s Pet Sematary and his dislike of the novel&#x27;s ending. He wanted to write a story in which the ghost child was not evil, but good. In the short story version, Card assumes Fletcher&#x27;s role as the protagonist. Some minor plot details are different in this story, such as the protagonist&#x27;s occupation (an editor for a video game magazine), and the story is told from a first-person perspective instead of the novel&#x27;s third-person perspective. Though he refers to many real events, such as his writing of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, the short story is also completely fictional. Because of his use of himself and his real occupation, real locations and real people, Card had to append a special note stating that the story is fictitious as he received criticism that his story was appropriating the grief of losing a child. However, the character Zap was inspired by Card&#x27;s son with cerebral palsy. According to Gary Westfahl, Card&#x27;s short story is &quot;moving&quot; but &quot;deeply offensive&quot; and the &quot;epitome of Card&#x27;s self-absorption&quot;. 

His first mainstream horror novel, Card has stated that &quot;Lost Boys&quot; was one of his hardest to write due to the emotional nature of the subject material. It is widely regarded by those who have read it as some of his most intense, personal writing. It was published by HarperCollins in 1992.

==Reception==
According to Publishers Weekly, &quot;some readers may find the fantastic plot elements jarring, [but] Card&#x27;s easy and natural prose goes a long way toward authenticating the supernatural intrusion&quot;. Kirkus Reviews called the novel, &quot;affecting, genuine, poignant, uplifting&quot;. However, Eugene England stated that Card deals with &quot;religious, theological, and moral issues&quot; better in his science fiction novels than in his realistic novels such as &quot;Lost Boys&quot;. Furthermore, England stated that &quot;Lost Boys&quot; loses &quot;the powerful edge of social criticism and utopianism that Card developed in the mid to late 1980s&quot;. England described the novel as, &quot;domestic Mormon realism, with a touch of magical realism&quot;. He described the juxtaposition and struggle between the evil existent in the prelude and the rest of the novel and the sacrifice of Stevie as &quot;Manicheistic&quot; and that Bappy and Stevie together create a personal form of &quot;independent and ultimately unredeemable existence&quot;. He concluded that though Card&#x27;s theology may be poor, he is a great storyteller and understands &quot;like Shakespeare and Milton, the power of redeeming love&quot;.

&quot;Lost Boys&quot; won the 1992 Association of Mormon Letters Award for Best Novel.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Lost Boys&quot; was optioned by Mostow/Lieberman Productions in 2002 to produce a film directed by Brian Carr. However, Mostow/Lieberman Productions was disbanded in 2004.

Orson Scott Card has claimed that many elements of M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; were plagiarized from &quot;Lost Boys&quot;, although he has said that enough had been changed that there was no point in suing.

<doc id="232935" wikidata="Q27239" url="?curid=232935" title="Willow warbler">
<text>The willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) is a very common and widespread leaf warbler which breeds throughout northern and temperate Europe and the Palearctic, from Ireland east to the Anadyr River basin in eastern Siberia. It is strongly migratory, with almost all of the population wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.

It is a bird of open woodlands with trees and ground cover for nesting, including most importantly birch, alder, and willow habitats. The nest is usually built in close contact with the ground, often in low vegetation. Like most Old World warblers (Sylviidae), this small passerine is insectivorous. In northern Europe, it is one of the first warblers to return in the spring, though later than the closely related chiffchaff. In spite of its small size, the willow warbler performs one of the longest migrations of any animal.

==Taxonomy==
The willow warbler was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla trochilus&quot;. The willow warbler is now one of around 80 species placed in the genus &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;leaf&quot; and &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;seeker&quot; (from , &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific epithet is Ancient Greek meaning &quot;wren&quot;.

Before the English name was standardised to willow warbler by William Yarrell in 1843, it was merged with the chiffchaff and wood warbler as the &quot;willow wren&quot;.

Three subspecies are recognised. There is a clinal reduction in green and yellow plumage tones from west to east, with central birds browner and easternmost birds predominantly greyish:
*&quot;P. t. trochilus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758). Breeds Europe (from the Pyrenees and Alps northward) except northern Scandinavia, winters west Africa.
*&quot;P. t. acredula&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758). Breeds northern Scandinavia east to western Siberia, winters central Africa.
*&quot;P. t. yakutensis&quot; (Ticehurst, 1935). Breeds eastern Siberia, winters eastern and southern Africa.

==Description==
The willow warbler is a typical leaf warbler in appearance, long and weight. It is greenish brown above and off-white to yellowish below; the wings are plain greenish-brown with no wingbars. Juveniles are yellower below than adults. It is very similar to the chiffchaff, but non-singing birds can be distinguished from that species by their paler pinkish-yellow legs (dark brown to blackish in chiffchaff), longer paler bill, more elegant shape and longer primary projection (wingtip). Its song is a simple repetitive descending whistle, while the contact call is a disyllabic &#x27;hoo-eet&#x27;, distinct from the more monosyllabic &#x27;hweet&#x27; of chiffchaffs.

==Behaviour==
All populations are highly migratory, with the subspecies &quot;P. t. yakutensis&quot; migrating up to from eastern Siberia to southern Africa along the Asian–East African Flyway, one of the longest migrations of any for a bird of its size. Approximate timings are:
*October to March: wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.
*Mid-March to mid-May: migrates and arrives in the breeding range.
*Late April to August: breeding season, usually only one brood but rarely two.
*August to October: migrates back to Africa.

==Status and conservation==
Willow warblers prefer young, open, scrubby woodland with small trees, including human-altered habitats such as coppice and young plantations up to 10–20 years old. High amounts of birch, alder and willow, with good lichen amounts, and water features (e.g. streams), fields with large amounts of bracken and mosses, and patches of low bramble (for nest cover) are preferred, but it will use a wide range of other species, including young or open coniferous forests. Incorporating woodland ride edge thickets of varying structure and height is beneficial. They prefer damp woodland areas. Thicket forming shrubs like blackthorn provide pockets of habitat. Deer browsing can degrade the required low cover.

The highest population densities are found in Scandinavia (where it is the commonest bird of any), with up to 1,100 pairs per square kilometre, and a total population in Sweden and Finland of 24 million pairs. Lower densities occur further east, with peak densities of 27 pairs per square kilometre in central Siberia. Even lower densities are found on the southern edge of the breeding range, with just 9 pairs per square kilometre in Switzerland, and a total of just 100 pairs in the whole of northern Spain.

In England this species has on average decreased in population by 70% within the last 25 years, with the biggest declines in the southeast. In Scotland some increases have occurred. The Forestry Commission offers grants under a scheme called England&#x27;s Woodland Improvement Grant (EWIG); as does Natural England&#x27;s Environmental Stewardship Scheme.

<doc id="232937" wikidata="Q915868" url="?curid=232937" title="Spliceosome">
<text>A spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex found primarily within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. The spliceosome is assembled from small nuclear RNAs (snRNA) and numerous proteins. Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules bind to specific proteins to form a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (snRNP, pronounced &quot;snurps&quot;), which in turn combines with other snRNPs to form a large ribonucleoprotein complex called a spliceosome. The spliceosome removes introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA, a type of primary transcript. This process is generally referred to as splicing. An analogy is a film editor, who selectively cuts out irrelevant or incorrect material (equivalent to the introns) from the initial film and sends the cleaned-up version to the director for the final cut.

However, sometimes the RNA within the intron acts as a ribozyme, splicing itself without the use of a spliceosome or protein enzymes.

==History==

In 1977, work by the Sharp and Roberts labs revealed that genes of higher organisms are &quot;split&quot; or present in several distinct segments along the DNA molecule. The coding regions of the gene are separated by non-coding DNA that is not involved in protein expression. The split gene structure was found when adenoviral mRNAs were hybridized to endonuclease cleavage fragments of single stranded viral DNA. It was observed that the mRNAs of the mRNA-DNA hybrids contained 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; tails of non-hydrogen bonded regions. When larger fragments of viral DNAs were used, forked structures of looped out DNA were observed when hybridized to the viral mRNAs. It was realised that the looped out regions, the introns, are excised from the precursor mRNAs in a process Sharp named &quot;splicing&quot;. The split gene structure was subsequently found to be common to most eukaryotic genes. Phillip Sharp and Richard J. Roberts were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine 1993 for the discovery of introns and the splicing process.

==Composition==
Each spliceosome is composed of five small nuclear RNAs (snRNA) and a range of associated protein factors. When these small RNAs are combined with the protein factors, they make RNA-protein complexes called snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, pronounced &quot;snurps&quot;).
The snRNAs that make up the major spliceosome are named U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, so-called because they are rich in uridine, and participate in several RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions.

The assembly of the spliceosome occurs on each pre-mRNA (also known as heterogeneous nuclear RNA, hn-RNA) at each exon:intron junction. The pre-mRNA introns contains specific sequence elements that are recognized and utilized during spliceosome assembly. These include the 5&#x27; end splice site, the branch point sequence, the polypyrimidine tract, and the 3&#x27; end splice site. The spliceosome catalyzes the removal of introns, and the ligation of the flanking exons.

Introns typically have a GU nucleotide sequence at the 5&#x27; end splice site, and an AG at the 3&#x27; end splice site. The 3&#x27; splice site can be further defined by a variable length of polypyrimidines, called the polypyrimidine tract (PPT), which serves the dual function of recruiting factors to the 3&#x27; splice site and possibly recruiting factors to the branch point sequence (BPS). The BPS contains the conserved adenosine required for the first step of splicing.

Many proteins exhibit a zinc-binding motif, which underscores the importance of zinc in the splicing mechanism. The first molecular-resolution reconstruction of U4/U6.U5 triple small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri-snRNP) complex was reported in 2016.

Cryo-EM has been applied extensively by Shi et al. to elucidate the near-/atomic structure of spliceosome in both yeast and humans. The molecular framework of spliceosome at near-atomic-resolution demonstrates Spp42 component of U5 snRNP forms a central scaffold and anchors the catalytic center in yeast. The atomic structure of the human spliceosome illustrates the step II component Slu7 adopts an extended structure, poised for selection of the 3&#x27;-splice site. All five metals (assigned as Mg2+) in the yeast complex are preserved in the human complex.

==Alternative splicing==

Alternative splicing (the re-combination of different exons) is a major source of genetic diversity in eukaryotes. Splice variants have been used to account for the relatively small number of protein coding genes in the human genome, currently estimated at around 20,000. One particular Drosophila gene, Dscam, has been speculated to be alternatively spliced into 38,000 different mRNAs, assuming all of its exons can splice independently of each other.

==Location of splicing==

Pre-mRNA splicing factors were originally found to be concentrated in nuclear bodies known as nuclear speckles. It was originally postulated that nuclear speckles are either sites of mRNA splicing or storage sites of mRNA splicing factors. It is now understood that nuclear speckles help concentrate splicing factors near genes that are physically located close to them. Genes located farther from speckles can still be transcribed and spliced, but their splicing is less efficient compared to those closer to speckles. RNA splicing is a biochemical reaction, and like all biochemical reactions, its rate depends on the concentration of enzymes and substrates. In this case, the enzymes are the spliceosomes, and the substrates are the pre-mRNAs. By varying the concentration of spliceosomes and pre-mRNAs based on their proximity to nuclear speckles, cells could potentially regulate the efficiency of splicing.

==Assembly==
The model for formation of the spliceosome active site involves an ordered, stepwise assembly of discrete snRNP particles on the pre-mRNA substrate. The first recognition of pre-mRNAs involves U1 snRNP binding to the 5&#x27; end splice site of the pre-mRNA and other non-snRNP associated factors to form the commitment complex, or early (E) complex in mammals. The commitment complex is an ATP-independent complex that commits the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway. U2 snRNP is recruited to the branch region through interactions with the E complex component U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) and possibly U1 snRNP. In an ATP-dependent reaction, U2 snRNP becomes tightly associated with the branch point sequence (BPS) to form complex A. A duplex formed between U2 snRNP and the pre-mRNA branch region bulges out the branch adenosine specifying it as the nucleophile for the first transesterification.

The presence of a pseudouridine residue in U2 snRNA, nearly opposite of the branch site, results in an altered conformation of the RNA-RNA duplex upon the U2 snRNP binding. Specifically, the altered structure of the duplex induced by the pseudouridine places the 2&#x27; OH of the bulged adenosine in a favorable position for the first step of splicing. The U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP (see Figure 1) is recruited to the assembling spliceosome to form complex B, and following several rearrangements, complex C is activated for catalysis. It is unclear how the tri-snRNP is recruited to complex A, but this process may be mediated through protein-protein interactions and/or base pairing interactions between U2 snRNA and U6 snRNA.

The U5 snRNP interacts with sequences at the 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; splice sites via the invariant loop of U5 snRNA and U5 protein components interact with the 3&#x27; splice site region.

Upon recruitment of the tri-snRNP, several RNA-RNA rearrangements precede the first catalytic step and further rearrangements occur in the catalytically active spliceosome. Several of the RNA-RNA interactions are mutually exclusive; however, it is not known what triggers these interactions, nor the order of these rearrangements. The first rearrangement is probably the displacement of U1 snRNP from the 5&#x27; splice site and formation of a U6 snRNA interaction. It is known that U1 snRNP is only weakly associated with fully formed spliceosomes, and U1 snRNP is inhibitory to the formation of a U6-5&#x27; splice site interaction on a model of substrate oligonucleotide containing a short 5&#x27; exon and 5&#x27; splice site. Binding of U2 snRNP to the branch point sequence (BPS) is one example of an RNA-RNA interaction displacing a protein-RNA interaction. Upon recruitment of U2 snRNP, the branch binding protein SF1 in the commitment complex is displaced since the binding site of U2 snRNA and SF1 are mutually exclusive events.

Within the U2 snRNA, there are other mutually exclusive rearrangements that occur between competing conformations. For example, in the active form, stem loop IIa is favored; in the inactive form a mutually exclusive interaction between the loop and a downstream sequence predominates. It is unclear how U4 is displaced from U6 snRNA, although RNA has been implicated in spliceosome assembly, and may function to unwind U4/U6 and promote the formation of a U2/U6 snRNA interaction. The interactions of U4/U6 stem loops I and II dissociate and the freed stem loop II region of U6 folds on itself to form an intramolecular stem loop and U4 is no longer required in further spliceosome assembly. The freed stem loop I region of U6 base pairs with U2 snRNA forming the U2/U6 helix I. However, the helix I structure is mutually exclusive with the 3&#x27; half of an internal 5&#x27; stem loop region of U2 snRNA.

== Minor spliceosome ==

Some eukaryotes have a second spliceosome, the so-called minor spliceosome.
A group of less abundant snRNAs, U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac, together with U5, are subunits of the minor spliceosome that splices a rare class of pre-mRNA introns, denoted U12-type. The minor spliceosome is located in the nucleus like its major counterpart, though there are exceptions in some specialised cells including anucleate platelets and the dendroplasm (dendrite cytoplasm) of neuronal cells.

<doc id="232940" wikidata="Q3118976" url="?curid=232940" title="War on poverty">
<text>The war on poverty is the unofficial name for legislation first introduced by United States President Lyndon B. Johnson during his State of the Union Address on January 8, 1964. This legislation was proposed by Johnson in response to a national poverty rate of around nineteen percent. The speech led the United States Congress to pass the Economic Opportunity Act, which established the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to administer the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty. The forty programs established by the Act were collectively aimed at eliminating poverty by improving living conditions for residents of low-income neighborhoods and by helping the poor access economic opportunities long denied from them.

As a part of the Great Society, Johnson believed in expanding the federal government&#x27;s roles in education and health care as poverty reduction strategies. These policies can also be seen as a continuation of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, which ran from 1933 to 1937, and Roosevelt&#x27;s Four Freedoms of 1941. Prior to John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963, Kennedy planned on proposing anti-poverty legislation in the 1964 State of the Union address that Johnson ended up giving. In that address, Johnson stated, &quot;Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it&quot;.

The war on poverty was heavily criticized by conservatives and has been treated as an &quot;idealistic touchstone&quot; by liberals for decades, although some liberals felt that the war on poverty did not go far enough with its reforms. Deregulation, growing criticism of the welfare state, and an ideological shift to reducing federal aid to impoverished people in the 1980s and 1990s culminated in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, which President Bill Clinton claimed &quot;ended welfare as we know it.&quot; The legacy of the war on poverty policy initiative remains in the continued existence of such federal government programs as Head Start, Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), TRiO, and Job Corps.

The official poverty rate has fallen from 19.5% in 1963 to 10.5% in 2019 while other measures of poverty show that the poverty rate fell from 19.5% to 1.6%. In 2021 the official poverty rate was 11.6% and Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) was 7.8%, the latter which increased to 12.4% in 2022 due to the end of pandemic aid.

==Major initiatives==
* The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 which created the Community Action Program, Job Corps and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), centerpiece of the &quot;war on poverty&quot; – August 20, 1964
* Food Stamp Act of 1964 – August 31, 1964
* Elementary and Secondary Education Act – April 11, 1965
* Social Security Act of 1965 (Created Medicare and Medicaid) – July 30, 1965

The Office of Economic Opportunity was the agency responsible for administering most of the war on poverty programs created during Johnson&#x27;s Administration, including VISTA, Job Corps, Head Start, Legal Services and the Community Action Program. The OEO was established in 1964 and quickly became a target of both left-wing and right-wing critics of the War on Poverty. Directors of the OEO included Sargent Shriver, Bertrand Harding, and Donald Rumsfeld.

The OEO launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965. The project was designed to help end poverty by providing preschool children from low-income families with a program that would meet emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs. Head Start was then transferred to the Office of Child Development in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (later the Department of Health and Human Services) by the Nixon Administration in 1969.

President Johnson also announced a second project to follow children from the Head Start program. This was implemented in 1967 with Project Follow Through, the largest educational experiment ever conducted.

The policy trains disadvantaged and at-risk youth and has provided more than 2 million disadvantaged young people with the integrated academic, vocational, and social skills training they need to gain independence and get quality, long-term jobs or further their education. Job Corps continues to help 70,000 youths annually at 122 Job Corps centers throughout the country. Besides vocational training, many Job Corps also offer GED programs as well as high school diplomas and programs to get students into college.

==Results and aftermath==
Some economists have claimed that the war on poverty did not result in a substantial reduction in poverty rates. Other critics have further claimed that Johnson&#x27;s programs made poor people too dependent on the government. Other scholars have disputed these criticisms. The effectiveness of the war on poverty was limited by American involvement in the Vietnam War, which consumed the country&#x27;s economic resources.

In the decade following the 1964 introduction of the war on poverty, poverty rates in the U.S. dropped to their lowest level since comprehensive records began in 1958: from 17.3% in the year the Economic Opportunity Act was implemented to 11.1% in 1973. They have remained between 11 and 15.2% ever since. It is important to note, however, that the steep decline in poverty rates began in 1959, 5 years before the introduction of the war on poverty (see figure 4 below).

A 2019 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that according to Johnson&#x27;s standard of poverty, the poverty rate declined from 19.5 percent in 1963 to 2.3 percent in 2017.

The &#x27;absolute poverty line&#x27; is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living—namely, having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health. Poverty among Americans between ages 18–64 has fallen only marginally since 1966, from 10.5% then to 10.1% today. Poverty has significantly fallen among Americans under 18 years old from 23% in 1964 down to less than 17%, although it has risen again to 20% in 2009. The most dramatic decrease in poverty was among Americans over 65, which fell from 28.5% in 1966 to 10.1% today.

In 2004, more than 35.9 million, or 12% of Americans including 12.1 million children, were considered to be living in poverty with an average growth of almost 1 million per year. According to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, since the Johnson Administration, almost $15 trillion has been spent on welfare, with poverty rates being about the same as during the Johnson Administration. A 2013 study published by Columbia University asserts that without the social safety net, the poverty rate would have been 29% for 2012, instead of 16%. According to OECD data from 2012, the poverty rate before taxes and transfers was 28.3%, while the poverty rate after taxes and transfers fell to 17.4%.

Nixon attacked Job Corps as an ineffective and wasteful program during his 1968 presidential campaign and sought to substantially cut back the program upon taking office in 1969. The OEO was dismantled by President Reagan in 1981, though many of the agency&#x27;s programs were transferred to other government agencies.

According to the &quot;Readers&#x27; Companion to U.S. Women&#x27;s History&quot;,

Many observers point out that the war on poverty&#x27;s attention to Black America created the grounds for the backlash that began in the 1970s. The perception by the white middle class that it was footing the bill for ever-increasing services to the poor led to diminished support for welfare state programs, especially those that targeted specific groups and neighborhoods. Many whites viewed Great Society programs as supporting the economic and social needs of low-income urban minorities; they lost sympathy, especially as the economy declined during the 1970s.

United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under President Jimmy Carter, Joseph A. Califano, Jr. wrote in 1999 in an issue of the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; that:

The fallout and backlash from the war on poverty gave way to what Kaaryn Gustafson called the criminalization of poverty. As white middle-class Americans became more disgruntled about the “government handouts” that Black low-income communities were receiving, policymakers and legislators took action to respond to their concerns. This led to more substantial restrictions on welfare and the policing of recipients of government assistance. The resentment that middle-class Americans harbored against communities on welfare translated into anti-welfare fraud policies that disproportionately targeted low-income Black communities and failed at responding to the most egregious forms of fraud.

In waging the war on poverty, congressional opposition was too strong to pass an income maintenance law. So LBJ took advantage of the biggest automatic cash machine around: Social Security. He proposed, and Congress enacted, whopping increases in the minimum benefits that lifted some two million Americans 65 and older above the poverty line. In 1996, thanks to those increased minimum benefits, Social Security lifted 12 million senior citizens above the poverty line ... No Great Society undertaking has been subjected to more withering conservative attacks than the Office of Economic Opportunity. Yet, the war on poverty was founded on the most conservative principle: Put the power in the local community, not in Washington; give people at the grassroots the ability to stand tall on their own two feet. Conservative claims that the OEO poverty programs were nothing but a waste of money are preposterous ... Eleven of the 12 programs that OEO launched in the mid-&#x27;60s are alive, well and funded at an annual rate exceeding $10 billion; apparently legislators believe they&#x27;re still working.

A 2019 study in the Journal of Political Economy found that the official poverty rate has fallen from 19.5% to 1.6%.

==Reception and critique==

President Johnson&#x27;s &quot;war on poverty&quot; speech was delivered at a time of recovery (the poverty level had fallen from 22.4% in 1959 to 19% in 1964 when the war on poverty was announced) and it was viewed by critics as an effort to get the United States Congress to authorize social welfare programs. Republicans ran against the War on Poverty program.

Some economists, including Milton Friedman, have argued that Johnson&#x27;s policies actually had a negative impact on the economy because of their interventionist nature, noting in a PBS interview that &quot;the government sets out to eliminate poverty, it has a war on poverty, so-called &quot;poverty&quot; increases. It has a welfare program, and the welfare program leads to an expansion of problems. A general attitude develops that government isn&#x27;t a very efficient way of doing things.&quot; Adherents of this school of thought recommend that the best way to fight poverty is not through government spending but through economic growth.

Historian Tony Judt said in reference to the earlier proposed title of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act that &quot;a more Orwellian title would be hard to conceive&quot; and attributed the decline in the popularity of the Great Society as a policy to its success, as fewer people feared hunger, sickness, and ignorance. Additionally, fewer people were concerned with ensuring a minimum standard for all citizens and social liberalism.

Economist Thomas Sowell also criticized the war on poverty&#x27;s programs, writing &quot;The black family, which had survived centuries of slavery and discrimination, began rapidly disintegrating in the liberal welfare state that subsidized unwed pregnancy and changed welfare from an emergency rescue to a way of life.&quot;

Others took a different tack. In 1967, in his book &quot;Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?&quot; Martin Luther King Jr. &quot;criticized Johnson&#x27;s war on poverty for being too piecemeal&quot;, saying that programs created under the &quot;war on poverty&quot; such as &quot;housing programs, job training and family counseling&quot; all had &quot;a fatal disadvantage [because] the programs have never proceeded on a coordinated basis...[and noted that] at no time has a total, coordinated and fully adequate program been conceived.&quot; In his speech on April 4, 1967, at Riverside Church in New York, NY, King connected the war in Vietnam with the &quot;war on poverty&quot;:

There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others, have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor –both black and white – through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam and I watched the program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such. Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home.

This criticism was repeated in his speech at the same place later that month when he said that &quot;and you may not know it, my friends, but it is estimated that we spend $500,000 to kill each enemy soldier, while we spend only fifty-three dollars for each person classified as poor, and much of that fifty-three dollars goes for salaries to people that are not poor. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor, and attack it as such.&quot; The next year, King started the Poor People&#x27;s Campaign to address the shortcomings of the &quot;war on poverty&quot; and to &quot;demand a check&quot; for suffering African-Americans which was carried on briefly after his death with the construction and maintenance of an encampment, Resurrection City, for over six weeks. Years later, a writer in &quot;The Nation&quot; remarked that &quot;the war on poverty has too often been a war on the poor themselves,&quot; but that much can be done.

In 1989, the former executive officer of the Task Force on Poverty Hyman Bookbinder addressed such criticisms of the &quot;war on poverty&quot; in an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He wrote that:

Today, the ranks of the poor are again swelling ... These and other statistics have led careless observers to conclude that the war on poverty failed. No, it has achieved many good results. Society has failed. It tired of the war too soon, gave it inadequate resources and did not open up new fronts as required. Large-scale homelessness, an explosion of teen-age pregnancies and single-parent households, rampant illiteracy, drugs and crime – these have been both the results of and causes of persistent poverty. While it is thus inappropriate to celebrate an anniversary of the war on poverty, it is important to point up some of the big gains ... Did every program of the 60&#x27;s work? Was every dollar used to its maximum potential? Should every Great Society program be reinstated or increased? Of course not ... First, we cannot afford not to resume the war. One way or another, the problem will remain expensive. Somehow, we will provide for the survival needs of the poorest: welfare, food stamps, beds and roofs for the homeless, Medicaid. The fewer poor there are, the fewer the relief problems. Getting people out of poverty is the most cost-effective public investment.&quot;

On March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan released his &quot;The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later&quot; report, asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended and that there is little evidence that these efforts have been successful. At the core of the report were recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs. In the appendix titled &quot;Measures of Poverty&quot;, when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements have &quot;implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones.&quot; Several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.

<doc id="232942" wikidata="Q243333" url="?curid=232942" title="Hyperborea">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Hyperboreans (, ; ) were a mythical people who lived in the far northern part of the known world. Their name appears to derive from the Greek , &quot;beyond Boreas&quot; (the God of the north wind). Some scholars prefer a derivation from (&quot;hyperpherō&quot;, &quot;to carry over&quot;).

Despite their location in an otherwise frigid part of the world, the Hyperboreans were believed to inhabit a sunny, temperate, and divinely blessed land. In many versions of the story, they lived north of the Riphean Mountains, which shielded them from the effects of the cold north wind. The oldest myths portray them as the favorites of Apollo, and some ancient Greek writers regarded the Hyperboreans as the mythical founders of Apollo&#x27;s shrines at Delos and Delphi.

Later writers disagreed on the existence and location of the Hyperboreans, with some regarding them as purely mythological, and others connecting them to real-world peoples and places in northern Eurasia (e.g. Britain, Scandinavia, or Siberia). In medieval and Renaissance literature, the Hyperboreans came to signify remoteness and exoticism. Modern scholars consider the Hyperborean myth to be an amalgam of ideas from ancient utopianism, &quot;edge of the earth&quot; stories, the cult of Apollo, and exaggerated reports of phenomena in northern Europe (e.g. the Arctic &quot;midnight sun&quot;).

==Early sources==

===Herodotus===
The earliest extant source that mentions Hyperborea in detail, Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot; (Book IV, Chapters 32–36), dates from . Herodotus recorded three earlier sources that supposedly mentioned the Hyperboreans, including Hesiod and Homer, the latter purportedly having written of Hyperborea in his lost work &quot;Epigoni&quot;. Homer&#x27;s provenance to the epic is suspect by Herodotus.

Herodotus wrote that the 7th-century BC poet Aristeas wrote of the Hyperboreans in a poem (now lost) called &quot;Arimaspea&quot; about a journey to the Issedones, who are estimated to have lived in the Kazakh Steppe. Beyond these lived the one-eyed Arimaspians, further on the gold-guarding griffins, and beyond these the Hyperboreans. Herodotus assumed that Hyperborea lay somewhere in Northeast Asia.

Pindar, lyric poet from Thebes and a contemporary of Herodotus in the tenth Pythian Ode described the Hyperboreans and tells of Perseus&#x27; journey to them.

Other 5th-century BC Greek authors, like Simonides of Ceos and Hellanicus of Lesbos, described or referenced the Hyperboreans in their works.

===Location===
The Hyperboreans were believed to live beyond the snowy Riphean Mountains, with Pausanias describing the location as &quot;The land of the Hyperboreans, men living beyond the home of Boreas.&quot; Homer placed Boreas in Thrace, and therefore Hyperborea was in his opinion north of Thrace, in Dacia. Sophocles (&quot;Antigone&quot;, 980–987), Aeschylus (&quot;Agamemnon&quot;, 193; 651), Simonides of Ceos (Schol. on Apollonius Rhodius, 1. 121) and Callimachus (&quot;Delian&quot;, [IV] 65) also placed Boreas in Thrace.

Other ancient writers believed the home of Boreas or the Riphean Mountains were in a different location. For example, Hecataeus of Miletus believed that the Riphean Mountains were adjacent to the Black Sea. Alternatively, Pindar placed the home of Boreas, the Riphean Mountains and Hyperborea all near the Danube.

Heraclides Ponticus and Antimachus in contrast identified the Riphean Mountains with the Alps, and the Hyperboreans as a Celtic tribe (perhaps the Helvetii) who lived just beyond them. Aristotle placed the Riphean mountains on the borders of Scythia, and Hyperborea further north. Hecataeus of Abdera and others believed Hyperborea was Britain.

Later Roman and Greek sources continued to change the location of the Riphean mountains, the home of Boreas, as well as Hyperborea, supposedly located beyond them. However, all these sources agreed these were all in the far north of Greece or southern Europe. The ancient grammarian Simmias of Rhodes in the 3rd century BC connected the Hyperboreans to the Massagetae and Posidonius in the 1st century BC to the Western Celts, but Pomponius Mela placed them even further north in the vicinity of the Arctic.

In maps based on reference points and descriptions given by Strabo, Hyperborea, shown variously as a peninsula or island, is located beyond what is now France, and stretches further north–south than east–west. Other descriptions put it in the general area of the Ural Mountains.

===Later classical sources===
Plutarch, writing in the 1st century AD, mentions Heraclides of Ponticus, who connected the Hyperboreans with the Gauls who had sacked Rome in the 4th century BC (see Battle of the Allia).

Aelian, Diodorus Siculus and Stephen of Byzantium all recorded important ancient Greek sources on Hyperborea, but added no new descriptions.

The 2nd-century AD Stoic philosopher Hierocles equated the Hyperboreans with the Scythians, and the Riphean Mountains with the Ural Mountains. Clement of Alexandria and other early Christian writers also made this same Scythian equation.

===Ancient identification with Britain===
Hyperborea was identified with Britain first by Hecataeus of Abdera in the 4th century BC, as in a preserved fragment by Diodorus Siculus:

In the regions beyond the land of the Celts there lies in the ocean an island no smaller than Sicily. This island, the account continues, is situated in the north and is inhabited by the Hyperboreans, who are called by that name because their home is beyond the point whence the north wind (Boreas) blows; and the island is both fertile and productive of every crop, and has an unusually temperate climate.

Hecateaus of Abdera also wrote that the Hyperboreans had on their island &quot;a magnificent sacred precinct of Apollo and a notable temple which is adorned with many votive offerings and is spherical in shape&quot;. Some scholars have identified this temple with Stonehenge. Diodorus, however, does not identify Hyperborea with Britain, and his description of Britain (5.21–23) makes no mention of the Hyperboreans or their spherical temple.

Pseudo-Scymnus, around 90 BC, wrote that Boreas dwelled at the extremity of Gaulish territory, and that he had a pillar erected in his name on the edge of the sea (&quot;Periegesis&quot;, 183). Some have claimed this is a geographical reference to northern France, and Hyperborea as the British Isles which lay just beyond the English Channel.

Ptolemy (&quot;Geographia&quot;, 2. 21) and Marcian of Heraclea (&quot;Periplus&quot;, 2. 42) both placed Hyperborea in the North Sea which they called the &quot;Hyperborean Ocean&quot;.

In his 1726 work on the druids, John Toland specifically identified Diodorus&#x27; Hyperborea with the Isle of Lewis, and the spherical temple with the Callanish Stones.

==Legends==
Along with Thule, Hyperborea was one of several to the Greeks and Romans, where Pliny, Pindar and Herodotus, as well as Virgil and Cicero, reported that people lived to the age of one thousand and enjoyed lives of complete happiness. Hecataeus of Abdera collated all the stories about the Hyperboreans current in the 4th century BC and published a lengthy, now-lost treatise on them that was noted by Diodorus Siculus (ii.47.1–2). Legend told that the sun was supposed to rise and set only once a year in Hyperborea, which would place it above or upon the Arctic Circle, or, more generally, in the arctic polar regions.

The ancient Greek writer Theopompus, in his work &quot;Philippica&quot;, claimed Hyperborea was once planned to be conquered by a large race of soldiers from another island; however, this plan was apparently abandoned, as the soldiers from Meropis realized the Hyperboreans were too strong, and too blessed, for them to be conquered. This unusual tale, which some believe was satire or comedy, was preserved by Aelian (&quot;Varia Historia&quot;, 3. 18).

Theseus visited the Hyperboreans and Pindar transferred Perseus&#x27; encounter with Medusa there from its traditional site in Libya, to the dissatisfaction of his Alexandrian editors.

Apollonius wrote that the Argonauts sighted Hyperborea, when they sailed through Eridanos.

===Hyperboreans in Delos===
Alone among the Twelve Olympians, the Greeks venerated Apollo among the Hyperboreans, and the god was thought to spend his winters there amongst them. 

According to Herodotus, offerings from the Hyperboreans came to Scythia packed with straw, and they were passed from tribe to tribe until they arrived at Dodona and from them to other Greek peoples until they to came to Apollo&#x27;s temple on Delos. He said they used this method because the first time the gifts were brought by two maidens, Hyperoche and Laodice, with an escort of five men, but none of them returned. To prevent this, the Hyperboreans began to bring the gifts to their borders and ask their neighbours to deliver them to the next country and so on until they arrived to Delos.

Herodotus also details that two other virgin maidens, Arge and Opis, had come from Hyperborea to Delos before, as a tribute to the goddess Ilithyia for ease of child-bearing, accompanied by the gods themselves. The maidens received honours in Delos, where the women collected gifts from them and sang hymns to them.

===Abaris the Hyperborean===

A particular Hyperborean legendary healer was known as &quot;Abaris&quot; or &quot;Abaris the Healer&quot; whom Herodotus first described in his works. Plato (&quot;Charmides&quot;, 158C) regarded Abaris as a physician from the far north, while Strabo reported Abaris was Scythian like the early philosopher Anacharsis (&quot;Geographica&quot;, 7. 3. 8).

===Physical appearance===
Greek legend asserts that the Boreades, who were the descendants of Boreas and the snow-nymph Chione (or Khione), founded the first theocratic monarchy on Hyperborea. This legend is found preserved in the writings of Aelian: 
Diodorus Siculus added to this account: 
The Boreades were thus believed to be giant kings, around tall, who ruled Hyperborea. No other physical descriptions of the Hyperboreans are provided in classical sources. However, Aelius Herodianus, a grammarian in the 3rd century, wrote that the mythical Arimaspi were identical to the Hyperboreans in physical appearance (&quot;De Prosodia Catholica&quot;, 1. 114) and Stephanus of Byzantium in the 6th century wrote the same (&quot;Ethnica&quot;, 118. 16). The ancient poet Callimachus described the Arimaspi as having fair hair, but it is disputed whether the Arimaspi were Hyperboreans. According to Herodianus, the Arimaspi were close in appearance to the Hyperboreans, making the inference that the Hyperboreans had fair hair being potentially valid.

===Celts as Hyperboreans===
Six classical Greek authors also came to identify the Hyperboreans with their Celtic neighbours in the north: Antimachus of Colophon, Protarchus, Heraclides Ponticus, Hecataeus of Abdera, Apollonius of Rhodes and Posidonius of Apamea. The way the Greeks understood their relationship with non-Greek peoples was significantly moulded by the way myths of the Golden Age were transplanted into the contemporary scene, especially in the context of Greek colonisation and trade.

As the Riphean mountains of the mythical past were identified with the Alps of northern Italy, there was at least a geographic rationale for identifying the Hyperboreans with the Celts living in and beyond the Alps, or at least the Hyperborean lands with the lands inhabited by the Celts. A reputation for feasting and a love of gold may have reinforced the connection.

==Identification as Hyperboreans==
Northern Europeans (Scandinavians), when confronted with the classical Greco-Roman culture of the Mediterranean, identified themselves with the Hyperboreans. This aligns with the traditional aspect of a perpetually sunny land beyond the north, since the Northern half of Scandinavia faces long days during high summer with no hour of darkness (&#x27;midnight sun&#x27;). This idea was especially strong during the 17th century in Sweden, where the later representatives of the ideology of Gothicism declared the Scandinavian peninsula both the lost Atlantis and the Hyperborean land.

Northern regions and their inhabitants have been called &quot;Hyperborean&quot;, without claims of descent from the mythological Hyperboreans. In this vein, the self-described &quot;Hyperborean-Roman Company&quot; () were a group of northern European scholars who studied classical ruins in Rome, founded in 1824 by Theodor Panofka, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, August Kestner and Eduard Gerhard. In this sense, Washington Irving, in elaborating on the Astor Expedition in the Pacific Northwest, described how:
While the fiery and magnificent Spaniard, inflamed with the mania for gold, has extended his discoveries and conquests over those brilliant countries scorched by the ardent sun of the tropics, the adroit and buoyant Frenchman, and the cool and calculating Briton, have pursued the less splendid, but no less lucrative, traffic in furs amidst the hyperborean regions of the Canadas, until they have advanced even within the Arctic Circle.

The term &quot;Hyperborean&quot; still sees some jocular contemporary use in reference to groups of people who live in a cold climate. Under the Library of Congress Classification System, the letter subclass PM includes &quot;Hyperborean Languages&quot;, a catch-all category that refers to all the linguistically unrelated languages of peoples living in Arctic regions, such as the Inuit.

Hyperborean has also been used in a metaphorical sense, to describe a sense of distance from the ordinary. In this way, Friedrich Nietzsche referred to his sympathetic readers as Hyperboreans in &quot;The Antichrist&quot; (written 1888, published 1895): &quot;Let us look each other in the face. We are Hyperboreans – we know well enough how remote our place is.&quot; He quoted Pindar and added &quot;Beyond the North, beyond the ice, beyond death – our life, our happiness.&quot;

==Hyperborean Indo-European hypothesis==
John G. Bennett wrote a research paper entitled &quot;The Hyperborean Origin of the Indo-European Culture&quot; (&quot;Journal Systematics&quot;, Vol. 1, No. 3, December 1963) in which he claimed the Indo-European homeland was in the far north, which he considered the Hyperborea of classical antiquity. This idea was earlier proposed by Bal Gangadhar Tilak (whom Bennett credits) in his &quot;The Arctic Home in the Vedas&quot; (1903) as well as the Austro-Hungarian ethnologist Karl Penka (&quot;Origins of the Aryans&quot;, 1883).

Soviet Indologist Natalia R. Guseva and Soviet ethnographer S. V. Zharnikova, influenced by Tilak&#x27;s &quot;The Arctic Home in the Vedas&quot;, argued for a northern Urals Arctic homeland of the Indo-Aryan and Slavic people. Their ideas were popularized by Russian nationalists.

==In modern esoteric thought==
According to Jason Jeffrey, H. P. Blavatsky, René Guénon and Julius Evola all shared the belief in the Hyperborean, polar origins of mankind and a subsequent solidification and devolution. Blavatsky describes the Hyperboreans as the origin of the second &quot;root race&quot; and as non-intelligent ethereal creatures that reproduced by budding. However, Jeffrey&#x27;s account may contradict some theosophical tenets, as according to other authors like Santucci, theosophy sees the passage from one root race to another as always evolution, never devolution, thus the Hyperborean could not be superior to modern man.

According to these esotericists, the Hyperborean people represented the Golden Age polar center of civilization and spirituality, with mankind, instead of evolving from a common ape ancestor, progressively devolving into an apelike state as a result of straying, both physically and spiritually, from its mystical otherworldly homeland in the Far North, succumbing to the &#x27;demonic&#x27; energies of the South Pole, the greatest point of materialization.

==Modern interpretations==

Since Herodotus places the Hyperboreans beyond the Massagetae and Issedones, both Central Asian peoples, it appears that his Hyperboreans may have lived in Siberia. Heracles sought the golden-antlered hind of Artemis in Hyperborea. As the reindeer is the only deer species of which females bear antlers, this would suggest an arctic or subarctic region. Following J. D. P. Bolton&#x27;s location of the Issedones on the south-western slopes of the Altay Mountains, Carl P. Ruck places Hyperborea beyond the Dzungarian Gate into northern Xinjiang, noting that the Hyperboreans were probably Chinese.

In 1974 Robert Charroux first related the Hyperboreans to an ancient astronaut race. Miguel Serrano was influenced by Charroux&#x27;s writings on the Hyperboreans.

Aleksandr Dugin has &quot;touted ancient legends about the sunken city of Atlantis and the mythical civilisation Hyperborea&quot; in defense of his vision of a vast Russian Empire. &quot;He believes Russia is the modern-day reincarnation of the ancient &#x27;Hyperboreans&#x27;, who need to stand at odds with the modern-day &#x27;Atlanteans&#x27;, the United States&quot;.

===Bronze Age origins===

The archaeologists Kristian Kristiansen and Thomas B. Larsson have argued that accounts of Hyperborea and its associated myths represent &quot;a mythological relict&quot; from the Bronze Age:

Archaeological evidence for Greek contacts with the north in the Bronze Age includes amber from the Baltic, amber necklaces from Britain and chariot equipment from the Steppe or Carpathian Basin found in the elite Shaft Graves at Mycenae, and Baltic amber found in the sanctuaries at Delphi and on Delos.

In 1924 the tombs associated with the Hyperborean maidens in Delos (Hyperoche, Laodice, Opis and Arge) were found &quot;in the very places described by Herodotus&quot; and exacavated by French archaeologists Charles Picard and Joseph Replat. Both pairs of tombs were found to date from the Bronze Age and contained Cycladic, Minoan and Mycenaean pottery dating from the period 1875–1420 BC (equivalent to Middle Minoan II to Late Minoan II). A &#x27;primitive cult&#x27; was apparently attached to the tombs in the Cycladic and Mycenaean age.

<text>Schwerte (; Westphalian: &quot;Schweierte&quot;) is a town in the district of Unna, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
Schwerte is situated in the Ruhr valley, at the south-east border of the Ruhr Area. South of Schwerte begins the mountainous Sauerland region.

===Division of the town===
After the local government reforms of 1975 Schwerte consists of the following districts:

* Schwerte
* Holzen
* Westhofen
* Ergste
* Geisecke
* Villigst
* Wandhofen
==History==
Schwerte received civic rights in the 12th century.

The railway facility in the eastern district of Schwerte became a branch of the Buchenwald concentration camp in April 1944. The camp had 445 prisoners in August and 670 in November 1944. The number of escapees was comparatively high; in November 1944 48 prisoners escaped. The camp in Schwerte was disbanded in December 1944 and the remaining prisoners were brought back to Buchenwald.

==Main sights==
*The Romanesque church of St. Victor has a carved altar of 1523, and stained glass of the 14th and 15th centuries.
*The Wuckenhof is a timber-framed house built in the 16th century.
*The &quot;Ruhrtalmuseum&quot; is situated in a former town hall, that was built in 1547.
*The &quot;Rohrmeisterei&quot; was built in 1889 by a water purification company. It was a pumping station until 1924. Today it is part of the German route of industrial heritage (&quot;Route der Industriekultur&quot;).
==Economy==
Today, there are some industries left, which are confined to the manufacture of iron and steel goods.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Schwerte is twinned with:

* Béthune, France (1960)
* Bruay-la-Buissière, France (1965)
* Violaines, France (1969)
* Allouagne, France (1975)
* Hastings, England, UK (1982)
* Cava de&#x27; Tirreni, Italy (1984)
* Leppävirta, Finland (1992)
* Pyatigorsk, Russia (1992)
* Ioannina, Greece (2022)

==Notable people==
*Johannes Goddaeus (1555–1632), jurist
*Heinrich Rehkemper (1894–1949), baritone singer
*Erwin Rösener (1902–1946), SS-Obergruppenführer Nazi officer executed for war crimes
*Werner van der Zyl (1902–1984), rabbi
*Detlef Lewe (1939–2008), sprint canoer, lived in Schwerte

<doc id="232952" wikidata="Q917661" url="?curid=232952" title="Degeneracy (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a degenerate case is a limiting case of a class of objects which appears to be qualitatively different from (and usually simpler than) the rest of the class; &quot;degeneracy&quot; is the condition of being a degenerate case.

The definitions of many classes of composite or structured objects often implicitly include inequalities. For example, the angles and the side lengths of a triangle are supposed to be positive. The limiting cases, where one or several of these inequalities become equalities, are degeneracies. In the case of triangles, one has a &quot;degenerate triangle&quot; if at least one side length or angle is zero. Equivalently, it becomes a &quot;line segment&quot;.

Often, the degenerate cases are the exceptional cases where changes to the usual dimension or the cardinality of the object (or of some part of it) occur. For example, a triangle is an object of dimension two, and a degenerate triangle is contained in a line, which makes its dimension one. This is similar to the case of a circle, whose dimension shrinks from two to zero as it degenerates into a point. As another example, the solution set of a system of equations that depends on parameters generally has a fixed cardinality and dimension, but cardinality and/or dimension may be different for some exceptional values, called degenerate cases. In such a degenerate case, the solution set is said to be degenerate.

For some classes of composite objects, the degenerate cases depend on the properties that are specifically studied. In particular, the class of objects may often be defined or characterized by systems of equations. In most scenarios, a given class of objects may be defined by several different systems of equations, and these different systems of equations may lead to different degenerate cases, while characterizing the same non-degenerate cases. This may be the reason for which there is no general definition of degeneracy, despite the fact that the concept is widely used and defined (if needed) in each specific situation.

A degenerate case thus has special features which makes it non-generic, or a special case. However, not all non-generic or special cases are degenerate. For example, right triangles, isosceles triangles and equilateral triangles are non-generic and non-degenerate. In fact, degenerate cases often correspond to singularities, either in the object or in some configuration space. For example, a conic section is degenerate if and only if it has singular points (e.g., point, line, intersecting lines).

==In geometry==

===Conic section===
A degenerate conic is a conic section (a second-degree plane curve, defined by a polynomial equation of degree two) that fails to be an irreducible curve.
* A point is a degenerate circle, namely one with radius 0.
* The line is a degenerate case of a parabola if the parabola resides on a tangent plane. In inversive geometry, a line is a degenerate case of a circle, with infinite radius.
* Two parallel lines also form a degenerate parabola.
* A line segment can be viewed as a degenerate case of an ellipse in which the semiminor axis goes to zero, the foci go to the endpoints, and the eccentricity goes to one.
*A circle can be thought of as a degenerate ellipse, as the eccentricity approaches 0 and the foci merge.
* An ellipse can also degenerate into a single point.
* A hyperbola can degenerate into two lines crossing at a point, through a family of hyperbolae having those lines as common asymptotes.

===Triangle===
A degenerate triangle is a &quot;flat&quot; triangle in the sense that it is contained in a line segment. It has thus collinear vertices and zero area. If the three vertices are pairwise distinct, it has two 0° angles and one 180° angle. If two vertices are equal, it has one 0° angle and two undefined angles. If all three vertices are equal, all three angles are undefined.

===Rectangle===
A rectangle with one pair of opposite sides of length zero degenerates to a line segment, with zero area. If both of the rectangle&#x27;s pairs of opposite sides have length zero, the rectangle degenerates to a point.

=== Hyperrectangle ===
A hyperrectangle is the -dimensional analog of a rectangle. If its sides along any of the axes has length zero, it degenerates to a lower-dimensional hyperrectangle, all the way down to a point if the sides aligned with every axis have length zero.

===Convex polygon===
A convex polygon is degenerate if at least two consecutive sides coincide at least partially, or at least one side has zero length, or at least one angle is 180°. Thus a degenerate convex polygon of &quot;n&quot; sides looks like a polygon with fewer sides. In the case of triangles, this definition coincides with the one that has been given above.

===Convex polyhedron===
A convex polyhedron is degenerate if either two adjacent facets are coplanar or two edges are aligned. In the case of a tetrahedron, this is equivalent to saying that all of its vertices lie in the same plane, giving it a volume of zero. 

===Standard torus===
* In contexts where self-intersection is allowed, a double-covered sphere is a degenerate standard torus where the axis of revolution passes through the center of the generating circle, rather than outside it.
* A torus degenerates to a circle when its minor radius goes to 0.

===Sphere===
When the radius of a sphere goes to zero, the resulting degenerate sphere of zero volume is a point.

===Other===
See general position for other examples.

==Elsewhere==
* A set containing a single point is a degenerate continuum.
* Objects such as the digon and monogon can be viewed as degenerate cases of polygons: valid in a general abstract mathematical sense, but not part of the original Euclidean conception of polygons.
* A random variable which can only take one value has a degenerate distribution; if that value is the real number 0, then its probability density is the Dirac delta function.
* A root of a polynomial is sometimes said to be &quot;degenerate&quot; if it is a multiple root, since generically the roots of an th degree polynomial are all distinct. This usage carries over to eigenproblems: a degenerate eigenvalue is a multiple root of the characteristic polynomial.
* In quantum mechanics, any such multiplicity in the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator gives rise to degenerate energy levels. Usually any such degeneracy indicates some underlying symmetry in the system.

<text>In astrophysics and condensed matter physics, electron degeneracy pressure is a quantum mechanical effect critical to understanding the stability of white dwarf stars and metal solids. It is a manifestation of the more general phenomenon of quantum degeneracy pressure.

The term &quot;degenerate&quot; here is not related to degenerate energy levels, but to Fermi–Dirac statistics close to the zero-temperature limit (temperatures much smaller than the Fermi temperature, which for metals is about 10000 K.)

In metals and in white dwarf stars, electrons can be modeled as a gas of non-interacting electrons confined to a finite volume. Although there are strong electromagnetic forces between the negatively charged electrons, these forces are approximately balanced by the positive nuclei and so can be neglected in the simplest models. The pressure exerted by the electrons is related to their kinetic energy. The degeneracy pressure is most prominent at low temperatures: If electrons were classical particles, the movement of the electrons would cease at absolute zero and the pressure of the electron gas would vanish. However, since electrons are quantum mechanical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same state, and it is not possible for all the electrons to have zero kinetic energy. Instead, the confinement makes the allowed energy levels quantized, and the electrons fill them from the bottom upwards. If many electrons are confined to a small volume, on average the electrons have a large kinetic energy, and a large pressure is exerted.

In white dwarf stars, the positive nuclei are completely ionized – disassociated from the electrons – and closely packed – a million times more dense than the Sun. At this density gravity exerts immense force pulling the nuclei together. This force is balanced by the electron degeneracy pressure keeping the star stable.

In metals, the positive nuclei are partly ionized and spaced by normal interatomic distances. Gravity has negligible effect; the positive ion cores are attracted to the negatively charged electron gas. This force is balanced by the electron degeneracy pressure.

== From the Fermi gas theory ==


Electrons are members of a family of particles known as fermions. Fermions, like the proton or the neutron, follow Pauli&#x27;s principle and Fermi–Dirac statistics. In general, for an ensemble of non-interacting fermions, also known as a Fermi gas, each particle can be treated independently with a single-fermion energy given by the purely kinetic term, 
formula_1
where is the momentum of one particle and its mass. Every possible momentum state of an electron within this volume up to the Fermi momentum being occupied.

The degeneracy pressure at zero temperature can be computed as
formula_2
where &quot;V&quot; is the total volume of the system and &quot;E&quot;tot is the total energy of the ensemble. Specifically for the electron degeneracy pressure, is substituted by the electron mass and the Fermi momentum is obtained from the Fermi energy, so the electron degeneracy pressure is given by
formula_3
where is the free electron density (the number of free electrons per unit volume). For the case of a metal, one can prove that this equation remains approximately true for temperatures lower than the Fermi temperature, about  kelvins.

When particle energies reach relativistic levels, a modified formula is required. The relativistic degeneracy pressure is proportional to .

== Examples ==

=== Metals ===
For the case of electrons in crystalline solid, several approximations are carefully justified to treat the electrons as independent particles. Usual models are the free electron model and the nearly free electron model. In the appropriate systems, the free electron pressure can be calculated; it can be shown that this pressure is an important contributor to the compressibility or bulk modulus of metals.

=== White dwarfs ===

Electron degeneracy pressure will halt the gravitational collapse of a star if its mass is below the Chandrasekhar limit (1.44 solar masses). This is the pressure that prevents a white dwarf star from collapsing. A star exceeding this limit and without significant thermally generated pressure will continue to collapse to form either a neutron star or black hole, because the degeneracy pressure provided by the electrons is weaker than the inward pull of gravity.

<text>A feature film or feature-length film (often abbreviated to feature), also called a theatrical film, is a film (motion picture or &quot;movie&quot;) with a running time long enough to be considered the principal or sole presentation in a commercial entertainment program. The term &quot;feature film&quot; originally referred to the main, full-length film in a cinema program that included a short film and often a newsreel. Matinee programs, especially in the US and Canada, in general, also included cartoons, at least one weekly serial and, typically, a second feature-length film on weekends.

The first narrative feature film was the 60-minute &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot; (1906, Australia). Other early feature films include &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1909, U.S.), &quot;L&#x27;Inferno&quot;, &quot;Defence of Sevastopol, The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; (1911), &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (American version), &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (British version), &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;From the Manger to the Cross&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1912), &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; (1913), &quot;Cabiria&quot; (1914) and &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915).

==Description==
The notion of how long a feature film should be has varied according to time and place. According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the American Film Institute and the British Film Institute, a feature film runs for more than 40 minutes, while the Screen Actors Guild asserts that a feature&#x27;s running time is 60 minutes or longer. The Centre National de la Cinématographie in France defines it as a 35 mm film longer than , which is exactly 58 minutes and 29 seconds for sound films.

== History ==

The term &quot;feature film&quot; came into use to refer to the main film presented in a cinema and the one which was promoted or advertised. The term was used to distinguish the longer film from the short films (referred to as shorts) typically presented before the main film, such as newsreels, serials, animated cartoons, live-action comedies and documentaries. There was no sudden increase in the running times of films to the present-day definitions of feature-length; the &quot;featured&quot; film on a film program in the early 1910s gradually expanded from two to three to four reels. Early features had been produced in the United States and France, but were released in individual (short film) scenes. This left exhibitors the option of playing them alone, to view an incomplete combination of some films, or to run them all together as a short film series.

Early features were mostly documentary-style films of noteworthy events. Some of the earliest feature-length productions were films of boxing matches, such as &quot;The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight&quot; (1897), &quot;Reproduction of the Corbett-Jeffries Fight&quot; and &quot;The Jeffries-Sharkey Fight&quot; (1899). Some consider the 100-minute &quot;The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight&quot; to be the first documentary feature film, but it is more accurately characterized as a sports program as it included the full unedited boxing match. In 1900, the documentary film &quot;Army Life&quot; was produced by Robert Paul. It was a programme of 33 short films, with a total running time of around 75 minutes, following the training of British soldiers. &quot;Inauguration of the Australian Commonwealth&quot; (1901) ran for 35 minutes, &quot;six times longer than any previous Australian film&quot;, and has been called &quot;possibly the first feature-length documentary made in Australia&quot;. American company S. Lubin released a Passion Play titled &quot;Lubin&#x27;s Passion Play&quot; in January 1903 in 31 parts, totaling about 60 minutes. The French company Pathé Frères released a different Passion Play in May 1903, &quot;The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ&quot;, in 32 parts, totaling 44 minutes.

Defined by length, the first dramatic feature film was the Australian 60-minute film &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot; (1906). Similarly, the first European feature was the 90-minute film &quot;L&#x27;Enfant prodigue&quot; (France, 1907), although that was an unmodified record of a stage play; Europe&#x27;s first feature adapted directly for the screen, &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, came from France in 1909. The first Russian feature was &quot;Defence of Sevastopol&quot; in 1911. Early Italian features included &quot;L&#x27;Inferno&quot; (1911), &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot;, &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1913) and &quot;Cabiria&quot; (1914). The first UK features were the documentary &quot;With Our King and Queen Through India&quot; (1912), filmed in Kinemacolor and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (also 1912). The first American features were &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;From the Manger to the Cross&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot; (all 1912). Actor Frederick Warde starred in some of these adaptations. The first Asian feature was Japan&#x27;s &quot;The Life Story of Tasuke Shiobara&quot; (1912), the first Indian feature was &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot; (1913), China&#x27;s first feature film was Zhang Shichuan&#x27;s &quot;Nan Fu Nan Qi&quot; (1913), the first South American feature was Brazil&#x27;s &quot;O Crime dos Banhados&quot; (1913), and the first African feature was South Africa&#x27;s &quot;De Voortrekkers&quot; (1916).

By 1915, over 600 feature films were produced annually in the United States. It is often incorrectly cited that &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915) was the first American feature film. The most prolific year of U.S. feature production was 1921, with 682 releases; the lowest number of releases was in 1963, with 213. Between 1922 and 1970, the U.S. and Japan alternated as leaders in the quantity of feature film production. Since 1971, the country with the highest feature output has been India, which produces a thousand films in more than twelve Indian languages each year.

==Technological developments==
In 1927, Warner Bros. released the first feature-length film with sound, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, whose audio track was recorded with a proprietary technology called Vitaphone. The film&#x27;s success persuaded other studios to go to the considerable expense of adding microphones to their sets, and scramble to start producing their own &quot;talkies&quot;.

One of the next major advancements made in movie production was color film. Even before color was a possibility in movies, early film makers were interested in how color could enhance their stories. Early techniques included hand tinting: painting each frame by hand. Cheaper and more widely used was toning: dying the film in a single color, used in many films in the 1920s. The film processing lab Technicolor developed the Three-Tone coloring technique that became the standard for color film. It was a complex, time consuming, and expensive process that many movie studios were not eager to try. One of the early adopters of the three-strip process was Disney. Some of the most notable films Technicolor processed with three-strip were &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

Digital Video (or DV) has quickly changed how most films are made. First used to create special effects and animated movies, digital cameras became more common on film sets in the late 1990s. In 2002, George Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; became the first major studio film shot primarily on digital video. The ability to instantly play back footage and quickly transfer footage to computers for editing helped to speed up post-production time. Digital film making was given a big boost in 2005 when the Digital Cinema Initiative created a guide for manufacturers to create a universal standard, to make the technologies more compatible with each other and more user friendly. Shooting movies on digital also led to new technologies for distributing films. &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;, released in 2000, was the first feature film to be released for viewing over the internet. Digital distribution changed the ways people received and watched media. It also gave viewers access to huge amounts of online content on demand.

<doc id="232964" wikidata="Q5590161" url="?curid=232964" title="Goya Foods">
<text>Goya Foods, Inc., is a producer and distributor of foods and beverages sold in the United States and many Spanish-speaking countries. It has facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Spain. It is under third-generation ownership of the Spanish-American Unanue family and is headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The company was founded in 1936 by Prudencio Unanue Ortiz and Carolina Casal de Valdés, a Spanish married couple, who emigrated to New York City. Upon Prudencio&#x27;s death in 1976, the company was valued at $8.5 million, and was passed on to sons Joseph, Charles, Francisco, and Anthony. Under Joseph&#x27;s tenure as chief executive Goya became a major corporation, which by 1998 produced about 800 food items, employed 2,000 workers, and had about $700 million in revenue. In 2004, Joseph was ousted by fellow family members, who replaced him with Robert Unanue, son of Anthony. By that time, the company generated more than $1 billion in revenue.

During Robert Unanue&#x27;s tenure as CEO, he has stirred controversy for his staunch support for Donald Trump, as well as his statements that the 2020 election, which was lost by Donald Trump, was rigged.

==History==
Goya Foods was established in the United States in 1936, in New York City, by Prudencio Unanue Ortiz (1886–1976) from Valle de Mena, Spain. Previously, he had immigrated to Puerto Rico, where he met and married Carolina Casal (1890–1984), also a Spanish immigrant. There the family had opened a small store called &quot;Unanue and Sons&quot; in 1922; however, it was converted to wholesale in the mid 1930s. Prudencio purchased the &quot;Goya&quot; name from a Moroccan sardine company because he believed that his last name was too difficult to pronounce for American customers and also liked the association to Spanish artist Francisco Goya.

When Prudencio Unanue died in 1976, he left Goya to his sons, Joseph, Charles, Francisco, and Anthony. Joseph A. Unanue became president and chief executive of Goya, then just an $8.5 million company, sharing control with Francisco, who served as president of Goya de Puerto Rico Inc., responsible for much of the company&#x27;s manufacturing operations. Joseph A. Unanue&#x27;s son, Joseph F. Unanue, was general manager and vice president of Goya de Puerto Rico from 1989 to 1996, when he became executive vice president at the company&#x27;s New Jersey headquarters, assuming the No. 2 position in the company; he died two years later.

During Joseph A. Unanue&#x27;s decades at the head of the company Goya grew to become a major corporation. By 1998, the company had 2,000 employees, and about $700 million in revenue from about 800 food items (including rice, beans, sauces, and spices). He was ousted from his then position as Goya chairman and CEO in 2004, amid a feud in the Unanue family about the direction of the company. At the time Goya was generating from $750 million to more than $1 billion in revenue. Joseph&#x27;s son Andy Unanue, the chief operating officer of the company, was forced out of Goya amid the disagreement, prompting litigation. Robert Unanue (Anthony&#x27;s son) and made the decision to remove Andy, who had previously been considered the &quot;heir apparent&quot; to Goya. Joseph Unanue retained a significant stake in the company, and retained a seat on its board; he died in 2013. Robert Unanue has been the chief executive since 2004. The fracturing of Goya&#x27;s ownership among its founders&#x27; descendants has frequently led to disputes about the company&#x27;s strategy.

In 2012, the company began construction on a $127 million distribution center in the industrial Meadowlands area of Jersey City, backed by state tax incentives that aided the company in its move from Secaucus.

In 2019, Goya had talks with The Carlyle Group about a possible buyout, which did not proceed.

==Description==

Goya manufactures and distributes products from the Spanish, Puerto Rican, Caribbean, Mexican, Cuban and Central and South American cuisine. Their products are sold in stores and supermarket chains throughout the United States (including Puerto Rico) and international markets. In 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Goya 355th on its list of the largest private companies in the United States.

Between 2014 and 2016 Goya opened five new facilities including manufacturing and distribution centers located in New Jersey, Texas, California, and Georgia to meet rising consumer demand. Currently, Goya Foods is headquartered on a lot in Jersey City, New Jersey. Goya also operates a manufacturing facility in San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic, and a distribution center in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

==Corporate affairs==

=== Goya Gives ===
&quot;Goya Gives&quot; is a program to support various charities, scholarships, and events, and includes donations of products to food shelters and food banks during times of crisis, such as Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. In March and April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Goya donated over of food, or about 270,000 meals, to food banks and other organizations in the United States, and also donated more than 20,000 protective masks.

=== MyPlate/MiPlato campaign===
In 2012, the company joined First Lady Michelle Obama&#x27;s &quot;My Plate&quot; healthy eating initiative.

=== Political views===
On July 9, 2020, at a White House roundtable discussion of the Hispanic Prosperity Initiative with President Donald Trump, Goya Foods co-owner and CEO Robert Unanue praised Trump, saying the country was &quot;truly blessed [...] to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder&quot; and adding, &quot;we have an incredible builder and we pray, we pray for our leadership, our president and for our country, that we continue to prosper and to grow.&quot;

Unanue&#x27;s comments prompted a call for a public boycott on social media, which was supported by various Latino public figures, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Julian Castro, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. In response, Unanue stated the next day that this was a &quot;suppression of speech&quot; and declined to apologize for his comments. Supporters called for an anti-boycott &quot;buycott&quot; in support of the company. Goya used its corporate Twitter account to call attention to its pledge made at the White House event to donate cans of food for those affected by COVID-19, and a Goya supporter launched a GoFundMe campaign that raised money to buy Goya products and donate them to food pantries.

On December 7, 2020, Unanue stated that Ocasio-Cortez was named &quot;employee of the month&quot; after her boycott call led to a 1000% sales spike. On January 26, 2021, Goya&#x27;s board of directors voted to censure Unanue following statements disputing the 2020 United States presidential election, banning him from speaking to the media. An anonymous CNN source familiar with the board’s actions claimed that Unanue&#x27;s statements &quot;imperiled the future of the company and endangered the lives of some of the shareholders,&quot; and that the controversy following Unanue&#x27;s White House appearance had not been good for the company. The majority of the company&#x27;s board favored removing Unanue from his position, but the family-owned business regulations did not allow for that.

During CPAC 2021, Goya Foods CEO Unanue claimed the 2020 election was illegitimate, and that Donald Trump was &quot;the real, the legitimate, and the still actual president&quot;.

In April, 2023, Jura Liaukonyte, an economics professor at Cornell University said that boycott efforts of Goya foods had not only failed, but had actually led to an increase in Goya sales. Liaukonyte made the statement during an interview regarding the 2023 boycott of Bud Light beer. Boycotts are typically short lived, Liaukonyte said, and in the case of Goya had backfired, as sales had increased from first-time buyers.

== In popular culture ==
Goya Foods logo and imagery has been featured in artwork, including paintings, prints and sculptures, most notably by Cuban-American artist Ric Garcia, sculptor Alexander Mijares, painter John Kilduff, and others.

<doc id="232971" wikidata="Q1264583" url="?curid=232971" title="SS Savannah">
<text>SS &quot;Savannah&quot; was an American hybrid sailing ship/sidewheel steamer built in 1818. She was the first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean, transiting mainly under sail power from May to June 1819. In spite of this historic voyage, the great space taken up by her large engine and its fuel at the expense of cargo, and the public&#x27;s anxiety over embracing her revolutionary steam power, kept &quot;Savannah&quot; from being a commercial success as a steamship. Originally laid down as a sailing packet, she was, following a severe and unrelated reversal of the financial fortunes of her owners, converted back into a sailing ship shortly after returning from Europe.

&quot;Savannah&quot; was wrecked off Long Island, New York in 1821. No other American-owned steamship would cross the Atlantic for almost thirty years after &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s pioneering voyage. Two British sidewheel steamships, Brunel&#x27;s SS &quot;Great Western&quot; and Menzies&#x27; SS &quot;Sirius&quot;, raced to New York in 1838, both voyages being made under steam power alone.

==Development==
&quot;Savannah&quot; was laid down as a sailing packet at the New York shipyard of Fickett &amp; Crockett. While the ship was still on the slipway, Captain Moses Rogers, with the financial backing of the Savannah Steam Ship Company, purchased the vessel in order to convert it to an auxiliary steamship and gain the prestige of inaugurating the world&#x27;s first transatlantic steamship service.

&quot;Savannah&quot; was fitted with an auxiliary steam engine and paddlewheels in addition to her sails. Moses Rogers himself supervised the installation of the machinery, while his distant cousin, and later brother-in-law, Stevens Rogers oversaw installation of the ship&#x27;s rigging and sails.

Since &quot;Savannah&quot; crossed the Atlantic mainly under sail power some sources contend that the first transatlantic steamship was the , crossing in 1833. It used sail only during boiler maintenance. Another claimant is the British-built Dutch-owned &quot;Curaçao&quot;, which used steam power for several days when crossing the Atlantic both ways in 1827.

==Description==
The Allaire Iron Works of New York supplied &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s engine cylinder, while the rest of the engine components and running gear were manufactured by the Speedwell Ironworks of New Jersey. The 90-horsepower low-pressure engine was of the inclined direct-acting type, with a single cylinder and a 5-foot stroke. &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s engine and machinery were unusually large for their time, and after the ship&#x27;s launch, Moses Rogers had difficulty locating a suitable boiler, rejecting several before settling on a copper model by boiler specialist Daniel Dod. The ship&#x27;s wrought-iron paddlewheels were 16 feet in diameter with eight buckets per wheel. For fuel, the vessel carried 75 tons of coal and 25 cords of wood.

As the ship was too small to carry much fuel, the engine was intended only for use in calm weather, when the sails were unable to provide a speed of at least four knots. In order to reduce drag and avoid damage when the engine was not in use, the paddlewheel buckets were linked by chains instead of bars, enabling the wheels to be folded up like fans and stored on deck. Similarly, the paddlewheel guards were made of canvas stretched over a metal frame which could also be packed away when not required. The whole process of retracting the wheels and guards took no more than about 15 minutes. &quot;Savannah&quot; is the only known ship to have been fitted with retractable paddlewheels.

&quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s hull and rigging were constructed under the direction of Captain Stevens Rogers, who later became the ship&#x27;s sailing master. The ship was full rigged like a normal sailing ship, excepting the absence of royal-masts and royals. Contemporary engravings suggest that &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s mainmast was set further astern than in normal sailing ships, in order to accommodate the engine and boiler.

===Interior===
&quot;Savannah&quot; was fitted with 32 passenger berths, with two berths in each of the 16 state rooms. The women&#x27;s quarters were reported to be &quot;entirely distinct&quot; from the men&#x27;s. Three fully furnished saloons were also provided, complete with imported carpets, curtains and hangings, and decorated with mirrors. The state rooms were large and comfortable and the interior has been described as more closely resembling a pleasure yacht than a steam packet.

==Early service==
When it became known that &quot;Savannah&quot; was intended for transatlantic service, the vessel was quickly dubbed a &quot;steam coffin&quot; in New York and Moses Rogers was unable to hire a crew there. Stevens Rogers then traveled to New London, Connecticut, his hometown, where his reputation was well established, and he could find seamen prepared to serve on the vessel.

&quot;Savannah&quot; conducted a successful trial of approximately two hours duration in New York Harbor to test her engine on Monday March 22, 1819. On Sunday, March 28 at 10a.m., &quot;Savannah&quot; sailed from New York to her operating port of Savannah, Georgia. The following morning the ship got steam up for the first time at 11a.m., but the engine was in use only half an hour before rough weather persuaded the captain to stow the paddlewheels and revert to sail power once again. The ship reached her destination April 6, having employed the engines for a total of 41½ hours during the 207-hour voyage. In spite of arriving at 4a.m., a large crowd was on hand to welcome the vessel into port.

===Presidential excursion===

A few days after &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s arrival in Savannah Harbor, the President of the United States, James Monroe, visited the nearby city of Charleston, South Carolina as part of an extended tour of inspection of arsenals, fortifications and public works along the East coast of the United States. On hearing of the visit, &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s principal owner William Scarbrough instructed Rogers to sail north to Charleston to invite the President to return to the city of Savannah aboard the steamship.

&quot;Savannah&quot; departed under steam for Charleston on April 14, and after an overnight stopover at Tybee Island Light, arrived at Charleston two days later. Scarbrough&#x27;s invitation was sent, but as the locals objected to the President leaving South Carolina on a Georgian vessel, he pledged to visit the ship at a later date. On April 30, &quot;Savannah&quot; made steam for her home port once again, arriving there the following day after a 27-hour voyage.

On May 7 and 8 &quot;Savannah&quot; took on coal, and on May 11, President Monroe made good on his promise and arrived to take an excursion on the ship. After the President and his entourage had been welcomed aboard, &quot;Savannah&quot; departed under steam around 8a.m. for Tybee Lighthouse, arriving there at 10:30 a.m., and departing for town again at 11. Monroe dined on board, expressing enthusiasm to the ship&#x27;s owner, Mr. Scarbrough, over the prospect of an American vessel inaugurating the world&#x27;s first transatlantic steamship service. The President was also greatly impressed by &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s machinery, and invited Scarbrough to bring the ship to Washington after her transatlantic crossing so that Congress could inspect the vessel with a view to purchasing her for use as a cruiser against Cuban pirates.

==Historic transatlantic voyage==
In the days following Monroe&#x27;s departure, &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s crew, with Captain Moses Rogers in command and Stevens Rogers as sailing master, made their final preparations for the Atlantic crossing. On May 15, the ship broke free from her moorings during a squall, but apart from slight damage to her paddles, the ship was unharmed.

&quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s owners made every effort to secure passengers and freight for the voyage, but no-one was willing to risk lives or property aboard such a novel vessel. On May 19, a late advertisement appeared in the local paper announcing the date of departure as May 20. In the event, &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s departure was delayed for two days after one of her crew returned to the vessel in a highly inebriated state, fell off the gangplank and drowned. In spite of this delay however, still no passengers came forward, and the ship would make her historic voyage purely in an experimental capacity.

===The voyage===

After leaving Savannah Harbor on May 22 and lingering at Tybee Lighthouse for several hours, &quot;Savannah&quot; commenced her historic voyage at 5a.m. on Monday May 24, 1819, under both steam and sail bound for Liverpool, England. At around 8a.m. the same day, the paddlewheels were stowed for the first time and the ship proceeded under sail. Several days later, on May 29, the schooner &quot;Contract&quot; spied a vessel &quot;with volumes of smoke issuing&quot;, and assuming it was a ship on fire, pursued it for several hours but was unable to catch up. &quot;Contract&quot;&#x27;s skipper eventually concluded the smoking vessel must be a steamboat crossing for Europe, exciting his admiration as &quot;a proud monument of Yankee skill and enterprise&quot;.

On June 2, &quot;Savannah&quot;, sailing at a speed of 9 or 10 knots, passed the sailing ship &quot;Pluto&quot;. After being informed by Captain Rogers that his novel vessel was functioning &quot;remarkably well&quot;, the crew of &quot;Pluto&quot; gave &quot;Savannah&quot; three cheers, as &quot;the happiest effort of mechanical genius that ever sailed the western sea.&quot; &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s next recorded encounter was not until June 19, off the coast of Ireland with the cutter HMS &quot;Kite&quot;, which made the same mistake as &quot;Contract&quot; three weeks earlier and chased the steamship for several hours believing it to be a sailing vessel on fire. Unable to catch the ship, &quot;Kite&quot; eventually fired several warning shots, and Captain Rogers brought his vessel to a halt, whereupon &quot;Kite&quot; caught up and its commander asked permission to inspect the ship. Permission was granted, and the British sailors are said to have been &quot;much gratified&quot; by the satisfaction of their curiosity.

On June 18, &quot;Savannah&quot; was becalmed off Cork after running out of fuel for her engine, but by June 20, the ship had made her way to Liverpool. Hundreds of boats came out to greet the unusual vessel, including a British sloop-of-war, an officer from whom hailed &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s sailing master Stevens Rogers, who happened to be on deck. The &quot;New London Gazette&quot; of Connecticut later reported the encounter in the following terms:

The officer of the boat asked [Rogers], &quot;Where is your master?&quot; to which he gave the laconic reply, &quot;I have no master, sir&quot;. &quot;Where&#x27;s your captain then?&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s below; do you wish to see him?&quot; &quot;I do, sir.&quot; The captain, who was then below, on being called, asked what he wanted, to which he answered, &quot;Why do you wear that penant, sir?&quot; &quot;Because my country allows me to, sir.&quot; &quot;My commander thinks it was done to insult him, and if you don&#x27;t take it down he will send a force to do it.&quot; Captain Rogers then exclaimed to the engineer, &quot;Get the hot-water engine ready.&quot; Although there was no such machine on board the vessel, it had the desired effect, and John Bull was glad to paddle off as fast as possible.

On approaching the city, &quot;Savannah&quot; was cheered by crowds thronging the piers and the roofs of houses. The ship made anchor at 6p.m. The voyage had lasted 29 days and 11 hours, during which time the vessel had employed her engine for a total of 80 hours, about 11% of the time.

===At Liverpool===
During &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s stay at Liverpool, the ship was visited by thousands of people from all walks of life, including officers of the army and navy and other &quot;persons of rank and influence.&quot; Perhaps reflecting the suspicion with which both nations still regarded one another after the recent War of 1812, some suspected the ship of planning to rescue Napoleon Bonaparte from prison on the island of St. Helena; his brother Jerome had recently offered a large reward for such a service.

&quot;Savannah&quot; remained at Liverpool for 25 days, while the crew scraped and repainted the ship, tested the engine, and replenished fuel and supplies. On July 21 the ship departed Liverpool bound for St. Petersburg in Russia.

===Sweden===
&quot;Savannah&quot; reached Elsinore (Helsingor), Denmark, on August 9, where she remained in quarantine for five days. On the 14th the ship sailed on to Stockholm, Sweden, thus becoming the first steamship to enter the Baltic Sea.

&quot;Savannah&quot; arrived at Stockholm on August 22, and on the 28th was visited by the Prince of Sweden and Norway. On September 1, an excursion on board the ship around the local islands was arranged, which was attended by the American and other ambassadors, nobles and prominent citizens. While in port at Stockholm, the Swedish government offered to purchase the vessel, but the terms were not attractive enough for Moses Rogers and he rejected the offer. Before leaving, the King of Sweden, Charles XIV John, presented Rogers with the gift of a stone and muller. On September 5, &quot;Savannah&quot; departed for Kronstadt, Russia, arriving there on the 9th.

===Russia===

At Kronstadt, the Emperor of Russia came aboard &quot;Savannah&quot; and presented Captain Rogers with gifts of a gold watch and two iron chairs. From Kronstadt, Rogers sailed on to St. Petersburg, arriving there September 13. During the journey from Liverpool to St. Petersburg, &quot;Savannah&quot; engine had its most frequent use, being employed for a total of 241 hours.

At St. Petersburg, the American ambassador to Russia extended an invitation to a number of prominent citizens to visit the ship. On September 18, 21 and 23, &quot;Savannah&quot; made several excursions under steam in the waters off St. Petersburg, with members of the Russian royal family and other noblemen, as well as army and navy officers aboard. During the ship&#x27;s stay at St. Petersburg, the Russian government also offered to purchase the vessel, but again the terms were not attractive enough for Moses Rogers to accept.

On September 27 and 28, &quot;Savannah&quot; was occupied in taking on coal and stores for her return journey to the United States. Before leaving, Lord Lynedoch of Scotland, who had travelled on board &quot;Savannah&quot; from Stockholm to St. Peterburg, presented Captain Moses Rogers and Sailing Master Stevens Rogers with a solid silver coffee urn and a gold snuffbox, respectively.

===Homeward crossing===
On September 29, &quot;Savannah&quot; sailed for Kronstadt on the first leg of her journey home. After experiencing several days of rough weather while at Kronstadt, during which the ship lost an anchor and hawser, &quot;Savannah&quot; left Kronstadt under steam on October 10 bound for Copenhagen, arriving on the 17th, continuing on to Helsingor to pay the Baltic exit toll, then stopping at Arendal, Norway, to wait out bad weather before heading out to open sea and her homeward crossing of the Atlantic. The ship experienced gales and rough seas almost all the way back to the United States, and the engine was not employed again until reaching home waters, the crossing having taken 40 days. &quot;Savannah&quot; steamed up the Savannah River and arrived safely back at her home port at 10a.m., November 30, six months and eight days from the date of her departure.

==Later history==
&quot;Savannah&quot; remained at her home port until December 3, when she set sail for Washington, D.C., arriving there on the 16th. In January 1820, a great fire swept through the city of Savannah, doing severe damage to the business district. The owners of the &quot;Savannah&quot;, William Scarbrough and his partners, suffered losses in the fire and were forced to sell the ship.

&quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s engine was removed and resold for the sum of $1,600 to the Allaire Iron Works, which had originally built the engine cylinder. The cylinder was preserved by the proprietor of the Allaire Works, James P. Allaire, and was later displayed at the New York Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1856. After removal of the engine, the ship was used as a sailing packet, operating between New York and Savannah, Georgia, until running aground along the south shore of Long Island on November 5, 1821, and subsequently breaking up.

&quot;Savannah&quot; had proven that a steamship was capable of crossing the ocean, but the public was not yet prepared to trust such means of conveyance on the open sea, and the large amount of space taken up by the engine and its fuel made the ship uneconomic in any case. It would be almost another 20 years before steamships began making regular crossings of the Atlantic, and another American-owned steamship would not do so until 1847, almost 30 years later.

The &#x27;Savannah&#x27; is portrayed on a 3¢ US commemorative stamp (Scott #923) issued on May 22, 1944.

In October 2022, a roughly 13-foot-square piece of weather-beaten wood flotsam washed up off Fire Island after Tropical Storm Ian. Experts say it is likely part of the SS Savannah. Evidence includes the 1-to-1.3-inch wooden pegs holding the wreckage&#x27;s planks together, consistent with a 100-foot vessel; the Savannah was 98 feet, 6 inches long. The wreckage&#x27;s iron spikes suggest a ship built around 1820; the Savannah was built in 1818. The piece of wreckage is now in the custody of the Fire Island Lighthouse Preservation Society, which will work with National Park Service officials to identify the wreckage and put it on public display.

<text>Catalin is a brand name for a thermosetting polymer developed and trademarked in 1927 by the American Catalin Corporation of New York City, when the patent on Bakelite expired that year. A phenol formaldehyde resin, it can be worked with files, grinders, and cutters, and polished to a fine sheen. 

Catalin is produced by a two-stage process, different from other types of phenolic resins, and does not contain fillers, such as sawdust or carbon black. Catalin is transparent, near colorless, rather than opaque. Unlike other phenolics, it can be produced in bright colors or even marbled. This fact has made Catalin more popular than other types of Bakelite for consumer products.

Catalin is heavy, quite greasy in feel, and as hard as brass. It is heat resistant and does not soften under boiling water. Like Bakelite, it gives off a distinctive phenolic odour when heated and can be tested by rubbing the material on a cloth with a spot of Simichrome Polish or Formula 409 cleaner, which will leave a characteristic light pink to yellow residue. Due to oxidation, older Catalin items darken in color; white discolors to yellow. This caused interesting effects in radio cabinets made from Catalin. Catalin radios were often made in stylish Art Deco designs and are sought after by collectors.

== Applications ==
Catalin was used from the 1930s to 1950s for many household objects, jewelry, small boxes, lamps, cutlery handles, and desk sets. Catalin jewelry, more commonly referred to incorrectly as Bakelite jewelry, was made from the 1930s until the end of World War II when it became too expensive, as every piece had to be individually cast and polished. The American Catalin Corporation introduced 15 new colors in 1927 and developed techniques to create marbling. The colors included yellow, orange, red, greens, blue, and purple, with clear, opaque and marbled versions. In the 1930s, jewelry made in these colors was popular with sets of beads, bangles, earrings, and rings being worn together.

Catalin was also used to make radios. In a labor-intensive process, liquid resin was cast and cured with heat, and then polished by hand into Art Deco designs. Notable designers of Catalin radios included Norman Bel Geddes and Walter Dorwin Teague. The bright colors of Catalin radios were meant to convey optimism during the Great Depression.

Jewelry made out of Catalin is usually referred to as Bakelite in the antique trade, while the household items, radios, cutlery, etc. are accurately referred to as Catalin.

The grips on John Wayne&#x27;s iconic six shooter, seen in every movie from &quot;El Dorado&quot; through &quot;True Grit&quot;, were made of Catalin, not ivory, as often thought.

Catalin has also been used for mountings on the great highland bagpipe. This use is no longer common due to a tendency for them to turn orange with age.

<text>April Catherine Glaspie (born April 26, 1942) is an American former diplomat and senior member of the Foreign Service, best known for her role in the events leading up to the Gulf War.

==Early life==

Glaspie was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and graduated from Mills College in Oakland, California, in 1963, and from Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in 1965.

In 1966 Glaspie entered the United States foreign service, where she became an expert on the Middle East. In 1969, Glaspie won the Meritorious Honor Award from the State Department. She was also the winner of the 1977 Director General&#x27;s Award for Reporting and as a result her name was inscribed on a permanent plaque in the Department&#x27;s Foreign Service Lounge. After postings in Kuwait, Syria, and Egypt, Glaspie was appointed ambassador to Iraq in 1988. She was the first woman to be appointed an American ambassador to an Arab country. She had a reputation as a respected Arabist, and her instructions were to broaden cultural and commercial contacts with the Iraqi regime.

Subsequently, Glaspie was posted to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York City. She was later posted to South Africa as Consul general in Cape Town. She held this post until her retirement in 2002.

==Career==

===United States Ambassador to Iraq===

====Meetings with Saddam Hussein====

Glaspie&#x27;s appointment as U.S. ambassador to Iraq followed a period from 1980 to 1989 during which the United States had given covert support to Iraq during its war with Iran.

Glaspie had her first meeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, on July 25, 1990. In her telegram from July 25, 1990, to the Department of State, Glaspie summarized the meeting as follows: 
Saddam told the ambassador on July 25 that Mubarak has arranged for Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations to meet in Riyadh, and then on July 28, 29 or 30, the Kuwaiti crown prince will come to Baghdad for serious negotiations. &quot;Nothing serious will happen&quot; before then, Saddam had promised Mubarak.

One version of the transcript has Glaspie saying: 
Later the transcript has Glaspie saying: 

Another version of the transcript (the one published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 23 September 1990) has Glaspie saying: 
When these purported transcripts were made public, Glaspie was accused of having given tacit approval for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which took place on August 2, 1990. It was argued that Glaspie&#x27;s statements that &quot;We have no opinion on your Arab-Arab conflicts&quot; and that &quot;the Kuwait issue is not associated with America&quot; were interpreted by Saddam as giving free rein to handle his disputes with Kuwait as he saw fit. It was also argued that Saddam would not have invaded Kuwait had he been given an explicit warning that such an invasion would be met with force by the United States. Journalist Edward Mortimer wrote in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; in November 1990: 
In September 1990, a pair of British journalists confronted Glaspie with the transcript of her meeting with Saddam Hussein, to which she replied that &quot;Obviously, I didn&#x27;t think, and nobody else did, that the Iraqis were going to take all of Kuwait.&quot;

In April 1991 Glaspie testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. She said that at the July 25 meeting she had &quot;repeatedly warned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein against using force to settle his dispute with Kuwait.&quot; She also said that Saddam had lied to her by denying he would invade Kuwait. Asked to explain how Saddam could have interpreted her comments as implying U.S. approval for the invasion of Kuwait, she replied: &quot;We foolishly did not realize he [Saddam] was stupid.&quot; In July 1991 State Department spokesperson Richard Boucher said at a press briefing:
The cables that Glaspie sent from Iraq about her meeting with Saddam are no longer classified. Glaspie&#x27;s cable on her meeting with Saddam reports that President George H. W. Bush &quot;had instructed her to broaden and deepen our relations with Iraq.&quot; Saddam, in turn, offered &quot;warm greetings&quot; to Bush and was &quot;surely sincere&quot; about not wanting war, the cable said.

Glaspie herself for years remained silent on the subject of her actions in Iraq. But in March 2008 she gave an interview to the Lebanese newspaper &quot;Dar Al-Hayat&quot;. In the interview, she said she has no regrets. &quot;It is over,&quot; Glaspie said. 
Nobody wants to take the blame. I am quite happy to take the blame. Perhaps I was not able to make Saddam Hussein believe that we would do what we said we would do, but in all honesty, I don&#x27;t think anybody in the world could have persuaded him.

In the interview, Glaspie recalled that her meeting with Saddam was interrupted when the Iraqi president received a phone call from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Saddam told her he had assured Mubarak that he would try to settle the dispute, she said. Her cable backs up this version of events; the Iraqi transcript, prepared by Saddam&#x27;s official English language translator, Sadoun al-Zubaydi, records Saddam saying that Mubarak called before he met with Glaspie.

===Retrospective views===
In 2002, the &quot;Washington Report on Middle East Affairs&quot; published a new account of the Glaspie-Saddam meeting by Andrew Killgore, a former U.S. ambassador to Qatar. Killgore summarized the meeting as follows:
The points referenced in the second and third paragraphs do not appear in the purported transcripts of the Glaspie-Saddam meeting that were released by Iraq, and on which most of the subsequent criticism of Glaspie is based. If there is a full transcript of the meeting in existence, or if the State Department declassifies Glaspie&#x27;s cables about the meeting, a different assessment might be reached on her performance.

James Akins, the U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia at the time, offered a somewhat different perspective in a 2000 interview on PBS:

Joseph C. Wilson, Glaspie&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Mission in Baghdad, referred to her meeting with Saddam Hussein in a May 14, 2004 interview on &quot;Democracy Now!:&quot; an &quot;Iraqi participant in the meeting [...] said to me very clearly that Saddam did not misunderstand, did not think he was getting a green or yellow light.&quot;

Wilson&#x27;s and Akins&#x27; views on this question are in line with those of former Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who stated in a 1996 interview with &quot;Frontline&quot; that, prior to the invasion of Kuwait, Iraq &quot;had no illusions&quot; about the likelihood of U.S. military intervention. Similarly, in a 2000 &quot;Frontline&quot; interview, Aziz declared, &quot;There were no mixed signals&quot;, and further elaborated:
Kenneth Pollack of the Brookings Institution, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on February 21, 2003, disagreed with the previously cited views of observers like Edward Mortimer. On Mortimer&#x27;s stated belief that it was likely Saddam Hussein went ahead with the invasion because he drew as inference from his meeting with Glaspie that the US would react with nothing more than verbal condemnation, Pollack said: 
Professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt write in the January/February 2003 edition of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; that Saddam approached the U.S. to find out how it would react to an invasion into Kuwait. Along with Glaspie&#x27;s comment that &quot;&#x27;[W]e have no opinion on the Arab–Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait&#x27;, the U.S. State Department had earlier told Saddam that Washington had &#x27;no special defense or security commitments to Kuwait.&#x27; The United States may not have intended to give Iraq a green light, but that is effectively what it did.&quot;

Following the US diplomatic cables leak and the January 2011 publication of Glaspie&#x27;s July 1990 cable describing her discussion with Saddam, Juan Cole noted that Glaspie &quot;pressed the dictator on the meaning of his troop build-up on the Kuwaiti border, letting him clearly know of American anxieties,&quot; and argued that &quot;her infamous reference to the U.S. not getting involved in inter-Arab disputes referred to a limited issue, the exact border between Iraq and Kuwait, and could not possibly have been interpreted as permission to invade Kuwait!&quot; Cole concluded: &quot;Ms. Glaspie&#x27;s detractors owe her an apology.&quot;

In his 2024 book &quot;The Achilles Trap&quot;, Steve Coll argues that Glaspie became a convenient scapegoat for broader United States Government failures to recognize and respond to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s intention to invade Kuwait. Coll suggests Glaspie was especially constrained by the positive attitudes toward Saddam of the Bush administration at that time:

Additionally, Coll points to Saddam&#x27;s admission years later, and recent supporting evidence, that the meeting with Glaspie had little impact on his intention to invade, which at the time of the meeting was already decided.

=== United Nations ambassador in Somalia ===
Glaspie served as a United Nations ambassador during pivotal events in 1993 in the United Nations Operation in Somalia II during the Somali Civil War.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 794 was unanimously passed on December 3, 1992, which approved a coalition of United Nations peacekeepers led by the United States. Forming the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), the alliance was tasked with assuring security until humanitarian efforts aimed at stabilizing the situation were transferred to the UN. Landing in 1993, the UN peacekeeping coalition started the two-year United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) primarily in the south. UNITAF&#x27;s original mandate was to use &quot;all necessary means&quot; to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian aid in accordance to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.

Major disagreements between the UN and the Somali National Alliance (SNA) began soon after the establishment of UNOSOM II, centering on the perceived true nature of the operations political mandate. In early May 1993, SNA head General Mohammed Farah Aidid and Colonel Abdullahi Yusuf of the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF) agreed to convene a peace conference for central Somalia. In light of recent conflict between the two, the initiative was seen a major step towards halting the Somali Civil War. Gen. Aidid, having initiated the talks with Col. Yusuf, considered himself the conference chair, setting the agenda. Beginning 9 May, elder delegations from their respective clans, Habr Gidr and Majerteen, met. While Aidid and Yusuf aimed for a central Somalia-focused conference, they clashed with UNOSOM, which aimed to include other regions and replace Aidid&#x27;s chairmanship with ex-President Abdullah Osman, a staunch critic of Aidid. As the conference began, Aidid sought assistance from UNOSOM ambassador Lansana Kouyate, who proposed air transport for delegates and a 14-day accommodation. However, he was called back to New York and replaced by April Glaspie, following which UNOSOM retracted its offer. Aidid resorted to private aircraft to transport delegates. Following the aircraft incident, Aidid would publicly rebuke the United Nations on Radio Mogadishu for interference in Somali internal affairs.

The contention between the Somali National Alliance and UNOSOM from this point forward would begin to manifest in anti-UNOSOM propaganda broadcast from SNA controlled Radio Mogadishu.

==== Radio Mogadishu ====
Radio Mogadishu was a popular broadcasting station controlled by the SNA. It had in recent weeks begun airing anti American and anti-UNOSOM propaganda condemning interference in Somali politics after UN envoy Admiral Johnathan Howe had rejected the May peace conference Aidid had set up. On the airwaves Aidid would publicly accuse UNOSOM II of engaging in colonialism and &quot;imperialist designs&quot;. These broadcasts greatly incensed UNOSOM officials and consequently a significant debate occurred over how best to deal with the station. According to then UNOSOM advisor John Drysdale, the UN&#x27;s &#x27;obsession&#x27; with the station was largely driven by US diplomat April Galspie. She held the view that the station should be destroyed or transferred to UNOSOM control, and felt so passionately about the issue that she had threatened to resign if the station was not dealt with. While certain UN officials felt that Radio Mogadishu broadcasts had become a threat to UNOSOM&#x27;s image, other officials and advisors noted that the broadcasts rhetoric were relatively mild and well within the bounds of reasonable speech. Drysdale argues that, &quot;There was virtually nothing in these broadcasts during May to which UNOSOM could have taken exception to. The language was moderate; there was no incitement, no subversion.&quot; 

From 1 May to 3 June 1993, Aidid spoke on the station publicly eight times. Four of the broadcasts were critical of UNOSOM, and focused on the UN&#x27;s handling of the May peace conference. There were also three uncritical statements of UNOSOM, during which he thanked officials publicly for aiding Somalia&#x27;s rehabilitation. The most serious public criticism was on 3 June 1993, when Aidid accused the UN of interference in the creation of a judiciary. 

On May 31, 1993, Aidids political rivals met with Johnathan Howe and attempted to convince him to take over Radio Mogadishu, a meeting Aidid was made well aware of. Rumor quickly began spreading across the city that the UNOSOM had actually resolved to shut down Radio Mogadishu entirely, which further angered Aidid, rumors which corroborated after the fact by the US special envoy to Somalia, Robert B. Oakley. The belief that UNOSOM was planning to seize station was reportedly widespread among Mogadishu residents. Mohammed Sahnoun, the representative of the UN Secretary-General in Somalia during UNOSOM I, reported that rumours of an attempted UN shut down of the station had reached him days before the incident. According to ambassador Oakley, Aidid saw the targeting of his SNA controlled station as specifically unfair on account of his main political rival Ali Mahdi also having a radio station that UNOSOM was not threatening, due to Mahdi&#x27;s claim that it was private.

==== Radio Mogadishu and 5 June 1993 inspection ====

Radio Mogadishu was considered a vital piece of SNA infrastructure that had been captured following a vicious battle with Ali Mahdi&#x27;s forces. Following the Kismayo and Galkayo incidents that station began to air anti-UNOSOM propaganda, incensing high ranking UN personnel. It was feared that the broadcasts would shift the attitudes of the Somali public towards the United Nations operation, leading UNOSOM officials to resolve to close the station. In mid-May, the Pakistani contingent was asked to draw up a plan to shut down the station. The Pakistanis did not possess the technical expertise required for such an operation and requested that the US supply experts.

Importantly, Radio Mogadishu had also been an &quot;Authorized Weapons Store Site&quot; (AWSS), subject to UNOSOM inspection. It was decided the American special forces technicians would accompany a Pakistani weapons inspection team to the site in order to determine how to disable the station. Gen. Aidid and the upper echelons of the Somali National Alliance, had been made aware of the discussions to seize or destroy the station.

According to the 1994 United Nations Inquiry:
Opinions differ, even among UNOSOM officials, on whether the weapons inspections of 5 June 1993 was genuine or was merely a cover-up for reconnaissance and subsequent seizure of Radio Mogadishu.
On the morning of Saturday June 5, 1993 an element of the Pakistani force in Somalia had been tasked with the inspection of site &quot;AWSS 5&quot;, which happened to be located at Aidid controlled Radio Mogadishu. The station was popular across the city, even among those who did not like Aidid or the Habr Gidr clan and concern that UNOSOM was coming to shut it down infuriated many citizens of Mogadishu. The fighting would result in 24 Pakistanis and dozens of Somalis killed. UNOSOM believed forces associated with Aidid were behind the attack. The 1994 UN Inquiry would conclude that in absence of a &quot;...more convincing explanation,&quot; it believed the Somali National Alliance was most likely behind the attack. Despite this, the commission noted that no evidence existed to back previous UNOSOM assertions that the attack had been pre-planned or pre-meditated by the SNA, and further noted that the incident had likely been a spontaneous reaction.

<doc id="232977" wikidata="Q4575089" url="?curid=232977" title="Kinky (band)">
<text>Kinky is a Mexican rock band, formed in 1998 as part of the Avanzada Regia musical movement and consisting of Gilberto Cerezo, Ulises Lozano, Carlos Chairez, Omar Góngora, and Cesar Pliego. Although a majority of songs are sung in Spanish, some songs contain English lyrics. Kinky were discovered and signed by Sonic360 Records.

==History==
===&quot;Kinky&quot;===
Their first album, called &quot;Kinky&quot;, was released in early 2002, co-produced by Chris Allison. It was a success in Latin America, and had some success in the U.S. Their second single, titled &quot;Más&quot;, was a success worldwide. &quot;Más&quot; was used in commercials for Nissan and the NBC Mexican Mafia mini-series &quot;Kingpin.&quot; It was also featured in the video games &quot;SSX 3&quot; and &quot;Crackdown&quot;, and the movies &quot;Thirteen&quot; and &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, which featured another song by Kinky, &quot;Field Goal&quot;. &quot;Mas&quot; was also used in an episode of &quot;&quot; called &quot;Silencer&quot;, season 4, episode 13 in which the band appeared at the beginning singing the song and the theatrical trailer of the film &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;. The song titled &quot;Cornman&quot; was used in the PlayStation 3 video game, LittleBigPlanet

In 2002, they joined Cake, De La Soul, The Flaming Lips, Hackensaw Boys, and Modest Mouse on the Unlimited Sunshine Tour in the U.S - the band also appeared at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

===&quot;Atlas&quot;===
In late 2003, the band released &quot;Atlas&quot;, their second studio album, the most alternative album of the band by far. Singles from &quot;Atlas&quot; included &quot;Presidente&quot;, &quot;Snapshot&quot; and &quot;La Hija del Caníbal&quot;.

===&quot;Reina&quot;===
In mid 2006, the band released &quot;Reina&quot; in an attempt to return to their electronic sound. Singles in the U.S. included &quot;Sister Twisted&quot; and &quot;Uruapan Breaks&quot;; in Mexico and Latin America, the song &quot;A Dónde Van Los Muertos?&quot; became a massive hit. Other Latin American singles included &quot;León&quot; and &quot;Una Línea de Luz&quot;.

===&quot;Barracuda&quot;===
In 2008, Kinky released their fourth studio album &quot;Barracuda&quot; which was co-produced with Money Mark (Beastie Boys). With the hit songs &quot;Hasta quemarnos&quot; and &quot;Those Girls&quot;, it launched the band on a world tour for two years.

===&quot;Sueño de la Máquina&quot;===
In mid-2012, Kinky&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Sueño de la Máquina&quot; was released. It was produced and mixed by John King of the Dust Brothers. The first track &quot;Inmovil&quot; was licensed in the racing game &quot;LittleBigPlanet Karting&quot;.

<text>Luis Ortiz Flores (born November 5, 1965, in Humacao) is a Puerto Rican former boxer.

==Amateur career==
Ortiz had an award-winning amateur career, which led him to represent Puerto Rico in the 1984 Los Angeles summer Olympics. Ortiz at first wasn&#x27;t very well known in Puerto Rico. Within days after he started competing in the Olympics, that changed, as he began to win bouts. When he secured a bronze medal at the games, he became a nationally known figure, because Puerto Rico had only had two other medalists in their Olympic history, Juan Evangelista Venegas (1948, bronze, boxing) and Orlando Maldonado (1976, bronze, boxing).

Ortiz made history, however, when he secured the silver medal a few days before the end of the games. According to him, he weighed himself on the morning of the day before the gold medal fight in his Olympic village room, and he outweighed his division&#x27;s weight limit (135 pounds) by one and a half pounds. As a consequence of that, since that moment and until the gold medal fight, he was placed in a strict, liquids-only diet by his training team.

Ortiz made the weight for the fight and was allowed to fight for the gold medal. However, he lost the fight by a knockout in round two to future multiple-time professional world champion Pernell Whitaker.

Ortiz and Arístides González also made history another way during these games: when Gonzalez won a bronze medal in boxing at the Middleweight division, these games became the first Olympic games in which Puerto Rico earned two medals in the same games. While José Torres, a Puerto Rican, won a silver medal in boxing at the 1956 Olympics, he did so representing the United States, as he was required to because he had resided there more than six months. Ortiz&#x27;s silver medal is historically recognized by Puerto Rican sports historians as the first silver medal won by Puerto Rico.

Nevertheless, Ortiz was the object of a hero&#x27;s welcome by about 300 fans at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan when he returned home. His hometown officially welcomed him by placing many banners on street lights and thank you messages.

=== Olympic results ===
*1st round bye
*Defeated Buala Sakul (Thailand) KO 2
*Defeated Alex Dickson (Great Britain) KO 2
*Defeated José Antonio Hernando (Spain) 5-0
*Defeated Martin N&#x27;Dongo (Cameroon) 3-2
*Lost to Pernell Whitaker (United States) TKO 2

==Pro career==
Ortiz tried professional boxing between 1985 and 1986. He did not enjoy much success in the professional rankings, winning 2 bouts and losing 1. His lone loss was to California fighter, Henry Lugo.

All his three professional fights were won or lost by decision. Ortiz retired soon after his third bout, and now holds an office job in his native town.

==Retirement (1986–present)==
In 2016, Ortiz made a bid to become a delegate of the Puerto Rico Boxing Federation.

<doc id="232997" wikidata="Q1564382" url="?curid=232997" title="HMS Ben-my-Chree">
<text>HMS &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; (Manx: &quot;Woman of My Heart&quot;) was a British packet steamer which served as a seaplane carrier in the Royal Navy during World War I. She was originally built in 1907 by Vickers for the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and was intended for use on the England–Isle of Man route. &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; was the third vessel to bear her name. To this day, she holds the crossing speed record from Liverpool to Douglas, Isle of Man for a steamship at under three hours.

She was chartered by the Royal Navy at the beginning of 1915 and participated in several abortive attacks on Germany in May. The ship was transferred to the Dardanelles in June to support the Gallipoli campaign, and one of her aircraft made the first ship-launched aerial torpedo attack on a ship in August. After Gallipoli was evacuated at the end of the year, &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; became the flagship of the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron which operated in the Eastern Mediterranean, performing reconnaissance missions and attacking Ottoman facilities and troops. 

She was sunk by Ottoman artillery fire while anchored at the recently occupied island of Kastellorizo in early 1917, with five members of her crew being injured. The ship was salvaged in 1920 and broken up in 1923. &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; was the only aviation vessel of either side sunk by enemy action during the war.

==Description and construction==

SS &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; had a tonnage of . The ship was long overall and long between perpendiculars. She had a beam of and a depth of from her main deck to the top of her keel. &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; had five decks and a capacity of 2,549 passengers with a crew of 119.

The ship was powered by three license-built Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft. They were powered by steam provided by four cylindrical boilers at a working pressure of that gave her a speed of . Her engines burnt up to of coal a day, which made her an expensive ship to run.

She was ordered in 1907 by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and was built at the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness at a cost of 112,000. The ship was launched on 23 March 1908 and completed on 8 August. &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; was normally laid up, because of her expense, except for the three busiest months of the year when she had a full complement of passengers.

SS &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; was chartered by the Royal Navy on 1 January 1915 and she began her conversion into a seaplane carrier at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead the following day. Part of her aft superstructure was removed and replaced by a hangar, aft of her rear funnel, that housed four to six seaplanes. The aircraft were lifted in and out of the water by derricks fore and aft. A dismountable flying-off platform was installed forward of her superstructure; it was equipped with a trolley and rails to allow a seaplane to take off.

In RN service the ship displaced , was long overall, and had a draught of . &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot;″s turbines generated and she was credited with a speed of although that speed was exceeded in service. The ship could carry of coal. Her crew consisted of approximately 250 officers and ratings.

Her armament consisted of four quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 18 cwt guns, and two Vickers three-pounder AA guns. &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; carried 130 rounds per 12-pounder and 64 rounds for each three-pounder. In May 1916, one 12-pounder AA gun, a three-pounder, and a 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot;, each on army carriages, were added.

She was initially assigned to the Harwich Force, under the command of Commander Cecil L&#x27;Estrange Malone, where on 3 May she took part in an abortive air raid on Norddeich that had to be abandoned because of thick fog. On 6 May, while on another unsuccessful mission to attack Norddeich, she was accidentally rammed by the destroyer in thick fog, although damage was slight. Another attempt was made on 11 May, but was again abandoned because of heavy fog. During this raid, &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; attempted to launch her Sopwith Schneider from a trolley off the fore deck, but the engine backfired, wrecking its starter, and breaking the pilot&#x27;s wrist as the starter handle was in the cockpit.

===To the Dardanelles===

In May 1915, she sailed for the Dardanelles, carrying two Short Type 184 torpedo bombers, and arrived at Lesbos on 10 June. Her aircraft were mainly involved in spotting for ships providing naval gunfire support for troops ashore, although they also conducted reconnaissance missions of the area. On 11 August, one of these missions had spotted an Ottoman ship off the north coast of the Sea of Marmora and, on the following day, Flight Commander Charles Edmonds attacked it flying a Short 184 seaplane. He left his observer behind and flew with a reduced fuel load to lighten his aircraft enough to carry a , torpedo. He successfully dropped his aerial torpedo at a distance of about and an altitude of . It turned out that his target had been beached after having been torpedoed by the British submarine . This was followed by a successful attack on 17 August against a ship by Edmonds. Flight Lieutenant George Dacre accompanied Edmonds on his flight in his own aircraft, but suffered engine troubles and had to land in the Dardanelles. He was taxiing on the water when he encountered a large steam tugboat, which he promptly torpedoed. After taxiing for several miles he was able to get airborne again and was within gliding distance of &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; when his engine failed permanently.
On 2 September, she helped to rescue Australian troops from the torpedoed troopship HMT &quot;Southland&quot; off Lemnos. The ship was transferred to Port Said, Egypt after the end of the Gallipoli Campaign. &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; became the flagship of the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron when it was formed in January 1916. The squadron was under the command of the General Officer Commanding, Egypt and its primary duty was to watch Ottoman positions and movements in southern Palestine and the Sinai. 

In February 1916 she was sent from Port Said to the Libyan coast; on 11 February, her aircraft observed Sidi Barrani and Sollum, and on 15 February discovered the Senussi were encamped at Agagia. collided with her on 11 February and badly damaged the ship&#x27;s bow. Permanent repairs took were made at Suez from 13 March to 25 April. 

Commander Charles Samson replaced L&#x27;Estrange Malone as captain on 14 May. A few days later, Lieutenant William Benn joined the ship as an observer. &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; was based at Aden later in 1916.

===Loss===
French troops occupied the Greek island of Kastellorizo, off the southwest coast of Turkey, on 20 December 1916 to use it as an advance base against the Ottomans. Not pleased at the presence of the French, the Ottomans secretly deployed an artillery battery of four and twelve guns within range of the island. The French commander requested a seaplane carrier to conduct reconnaissance in the area and &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; was sent in response. She arrived on 11 January 1917 and anchored in the harbour which faced the mainland. Ottoman guns opened fire about two hours later, hitting the carrier with their third shot. Subsequent shells disabled her steering and started a fire in her hangar that spread across her upper deck. (&quot;See&quot; Mustafa Ertuğrul Aker)
The crew was ordered to abandon ship after about forty minutes of the bombardment using the only remaining operable motor lifeboat of the three stowed on board. One officer and four ratings were injured, but no one was killed. The Ottomans continued their bombardment for five hours until &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; listed to starboard and sank in shallow water. Later in the day, the captain and the chief engineer returned to the wreck to rescue the ship&#x27;s mascots, a cat and dog which had both survived the attack.

&quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot;″s wreck remained in place until 15 August 1920 when it was refloated by the salvage ship &quot;Vallette&quot;. The wreck was immediately beached before the tow to the port of Piraeus began on 4 September. The ship proved to be a constructive total loss and was towed to Venice, Italy, in 1923 to be demolished.

During her short career she operated Sopwith Type 860, Schneider, and Baby aircraft, the Wight Pusher Seaplane, as well as Short Type 830 and Type 184 floatplanes.

<text>Ko Phi Phi Le or Ko Phi Phi Leh (, , ) is an island of the Phi Phi Archipelago, Andaman Sea. It is in the Krabi province of Thailand and is part of Hat Noppharat Thara–Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park.

==Geography==
Ko Phi Phi Le, in area, is the second largest island of the archipelago, the largest being Ko Phi Phi Don. The island consists of a ring of steep limestone hills surrounding two shallow bays, Maya Bay and Loh Samah. During low tide, Maya Bay cannot be accessed directly from the sea via boat, due to shallow waters and coral. Boats must anchor at the deeper Loh Samah, requiring people to walk through a short section of rocks and jungle to reach Maya Bay itself. There is also one large shallow fjord-like inlet called Pi Ley with a small coral reef at the entrance. Maya Bay harbors bioluminescent plankton.

==Tourism==
Hat Noppharat Thara–Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park as a whole, from October 2015 to May 2016, generated revenues of 362 million baht from 1.2 million tourists, 77 percent foreign. In 2018, the Maya Bay cove and beach closed temporarily, and then indefinitely to visitors because of environmental issues caused by overtourism. The cove reopened to tourists in early 2022, after nearly four years of closure.

==Environmental issues==
Controversy arose regarding the 1999 production of the film &quot;The Beach&quot;, released February 2000, due to 20th Century Fox bulldozing and landscaping the natural beach setting of Ko Phi Phi Le to make it more &quot;paradise-like&quot;. The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. The production company also removed 5 tonnes of garbage from the beach, left behind by tourists. Offers to restore this along with replanting were not accepted. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state. Nevertheless, lawsuits were filed as many believed the damage to the ecosystem is permanent and restoration attempts failed.

The lawsuits dragged on for years. In 2006, Thailand&#x27;s supreme court upheld an appeals court ruling that the filming had harmed the environment and ordered that damage assessments be made. Defendants in the case included 20th Century Fox and some Thai government officials.
The Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation claims to be investigating ways to control tourist numbers amid concerns that visitors are destroying the environment at marine tourism spots. The move was prompted by marine scientist Thon Thamrongnawasawat, who posted photos of large numbers of low-season tourists packed onto small Maya Beach. According to Mr Thon, during low season 2016, about 5,000 tourists a day crowd onto Maya beach, which is just 250 metres long and 15 metres wide. The beach has 14 available toilets. Tourists are worth 1.6 million baht a day to the park. Thon said that state agencies were running campaigns to drum up tourist numbers with no regard for the environment&#x27;s carrying capacity.

In March 2018, Thai authorities announced that Maya Beach would be closed to tourists for four months to allow it to recover from environmental damage due to excessive visitor numbers. The beach had been receiving an estimated 5,000 visitors per day, while 200 boats per day set anchor in the bay. Surveys by marine biologists had found that 80 percent of the coral reefs surrounding the bay have been destroyed by boat traffic and pollution; marine life was virtually nonexistent as a result. When Maya Beach reopens visitor numbers will be limited to 2,000 people per day and boats will have to dock outside the bay. The government will spend 100 million baht to construct a boat parking zone and floating pier to receive tourists. It will use an online ticketing system to manage sales and income from entry fees.
In June 2018, work on coral rehabilitation was initiated by the Marine National Park Operation Center 3 based in Trang. The coral rehabilitation system and methodology was obtained from Ocean Quest Global. Local non-governmental organizations like Reef Guardian Thailand also lent their hands in the restoration efforts.

On October 1, 2018, the Thai Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation announced that Maya Beach would be closed indefinitely, because tests performed during the four month closure earlier in the year found the ecological damage to be far more extensive than previously thought. The director of the office, Songtam Suksawang, said that the beach &quot;was completely destroyed, along with the plants which covered it,&quot; and that reopening would not occur until the ecosystem &quot;fully recovers to a normal situation.&quot;

In December 2018, it was reported that blacktip reef sharks were seen swimming close to Maya Bay&#x27;s beach. The bay had been closed to tourism in June due to the damage caused by mass tourism. Marine biologists took the return of the sharks as a positive signal that the tourist ban was allowing the ecosystem to heal.

By February 2019, over 15,000 corals from several local species have been propagated in the bay. The system of rehabilitation is fully organic and no artificial or man-made materials were introduced in the coral rehabilitation project. It is the largest coral rehabilitation project in the world that uses only natural means.

The restoration period for the bay was lengthened due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Blacktip sharks began breeding there again. In 2022, the bay reopened to tourists, under strict protocols of no boats, no swimming and no more than a one hour visit per person for a limited number of visitors at a time.

<text>Chai Wan (; ), formerly known as Sai Wan (西灣), lies at the east end of the urban area of Hong Kong Island next to Shau Kei Wan. The area is administratively part of the Eastern District, and is a mosaic of industrial and residential areas. The population was 186,505 in 2001.

==Geography==
Chai Wan is built on land reclaimed from the bay and extends west from Lei Yue Mun in Heng Fa Chuen (see below) and east to Siu Sai Wan. Mount Collinson and Pottinger Peak on the south and Mount Parker on the west, restrict further development. Shek O Country Park is at the south of Chai Wan.
==Panorama==
==History==
The name &quot;Chai&quot; literally means firewood, while &quot;Wan&quot; means bay. Its naming possibly because of rich production of firewood in early days.

The book Lo Uk folk Museum stated it was possible there were inhabitants settled in Chai Wan during Northern Song and Southern Song dynasty. During that period, there were merchants bought water in Chai Wan before they continued their journey to Guangzhou, Fujian province, for instance
Chai Wan was formerly known as Sai Wan (), meaning &quot;West Bay&quot;. At the beginning of the 18th century, the area consisted of six villages: Dai Ping Village, Law Uk, Luk Uk, Nam Uk, Sai Village, Sing Uk.

In 1845, the British military built a fort and a barracks in Siu Sai Wan. In December 1941, the Japanese invasion of the island resulted in the Battle of Hong Kong, with approximately 20 gunners executed at the Sai Wan Battery despite having surrendered. After the fort was closed in the 1980s, Sai Sau Wan become an area for new population.

In 1929, the Boy Scouts Association, Hong Kong Branch purchased land for the Chai Wan Campsite where Chai Wan Park is now situated. The land returned to Hong Kong Government for development in the early 1970s.

In 1952, the government began building low-income housing that gradually replaced rural villages in the area.

MTR Island line and Eastern Corridor Phrase 3 opened in 1985 and 1989 respectively, improving connection with rest of the Island and Hong Kong.

==Culture==
The Law Uk Folk Museum was formerly a village and is now a museum, a branch of the Hong Kong Museum of History.

==Housing==
This area has about 200-300 high rise buildings, most of them residential. It also has a number of public housing estates.

===Heng Fa Chuen===
Heng Fa Chuen is a private residential estate in Chai Wan, jointly developed by MTR Corporation and Kerry Properties. Construction of the residential estate began on 13August 1977, ended on 26April 1982 and officially opened on 10 July 1982.

The area was reclaimed from Pak Sha Wan () and Lei Yue Mun Bay (). The current promenade along the shoreline was once a beach, surrounded by barren hills and vegetation. Further west, there was once a quarry, near to the site of the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence. However, the quarry was decommissioned by the Hong Kong Government, after it was mined out. The miners dispersed, with some moving to Chai Wan and settling in wooden houses. There were still traces of it when the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence was established.

In the early 1980s, when the Island line of the MTR was being planned, the working name of the station was &quot;Chai Wan Quay&quot;, according to the Freeman, Fox, Wilbur Smith &amp; Associates &quot;Mass Transportation Study&quot;. It became Heng Fa Chuen when MTR became the rightful developer of the land for the station and depot. Not only was the name changed, but also it was relocated to its present place from the old location near Chai Wan pier/Ming Pao Industrial Centre.

There are 6,504 apartments in 48 residential blocks managed by MTR Property Management, with Paradise Mall, a shopping centre, attached to it. The world&#x27;s 11,000th McDonald&#x27;s fast-food restaurant was opened at Heng Fa Chuen in 1989. In 2000, a PARKnSHOP supermarket replaced the existing Carrefour giant chain supermarket. This Carrefour store, which opened in December 1996, was the first one opened in Hong Kong. It is an item of note that the area used to be under the flightpath of planes landing on the southern side of Kai Tak Airport&#x27;s runway, and therefore most tower blocks had to be built lower than 20 floors.

===Siu Sai Wan===

Siu Sai Wan is a newly developed residential area, located in the eastern part of Chai Wan. Notable landmarks in Siu Sai Wan include the largest sports ground on Hong Kong Island, the Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground and one of the largest private housing estates on Hong Kong Island, Island Resort.

<doc id="233008" wikidata="Q7591075" url="?curid=233008" title="St. Paul's College, Hong Kong">
<text>St. Paul&#x27;s College (SPC; ) is an Anglican day school for boys in Hong Kong. It was established in 1851, the oldest continuously operated school in Hong Kong. The college first opened in 1851 with only one tutor and nine pupils. Today, it has more than 1,200 pupils in the secondary section and nearly 600 pupils in the primary section.

St. Paul&#x27;s comprises an all-boys primary school section (Primary 1–6) and secondary section (Forms 1–6). The secondary school campus is situated in the Mid-Levels area, part of Hong Kong Island&#x27;s Western District, whilst the primary school operates in a dedicated campus at Pok Fu Lam in the Island&#x27;s Southern District.

The College Council enjoys a special status in Hong Kong, in that it is a statutory body incorporated by a local ordinance, the &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s College Council Incorporation Ordinance&quot; (Cap 1102, Laws of Hong Kong). The aim of the college is to &quot;provide a liberal education to Chinese youths in the English language upon Christian principles.&quot;.

==History==
===Establishment===
St. Paul&#x27;s College is the earliest Anglo-Chinese school. Its founder, Rev. Vincent John Stanton, was the first colonial chaplain of the former Colony of Hong Kong, appointed in 1843. In 1841, Rev. Stanton, raised funds in England to start an Anglo-Chinese school in Hong Kong.

The original purpose of such a fine establishment The Church of England Anglo-Chinese School was to train a body of native clergy and Christian teachers for the propagation of the Gospel in China...[and] to aid in the diffusion of Christian principles among the Chinese&#x27;. Thus, the school opened for the purpose of teaching English to Chinese boys in 1849. St. Paul&#x27;s College was officially founded in 1851, located at Glenealy in what is today the Central District.

The school opened with James Summers as headmaster, Rev. Edward T. R. Moncrieff as the tutor with nine boys. The number of students soon swelled to 33. Rev. Moncrieff, the school&#x27;s only tutor at the time, traveled to India, where he was killed in 1857 in the Indian Mutiny.

The college was suspended from 1857 to 1861. It reopened under sinologist John Fryer and was led by him for the ensuing two years.

Bishop Burden turned the building into a school mainly for English-speaking boys, which operated from 1873 to 1878. During this time, St. Paul&#x27;s College and St. Joseph&#x27;s College competed in the earliest inter-school football matches ever played in the colony. The college again became an Anglo-Chinese school, under the headmastership of A. T. Fryer in 1878. The college was suspended in 1899, and the building was used as a training school for Chinese Catechists under the leadership of Rev. P. A. Bunbury.

===Early 20th century===

The Church Missionary Society took over the school building, and St. Paul&#x27;s College reopened with Rev. A.D. Stewart as headmaster in 1908. Rev. Stewart&#x27;s brother Col. E. G. Stewart highlighted the primitive facilities of the school at this time in his article about St. Paul&#x27;s history. &quot;Some of us can remember the old south wing – two enormous classrooms on the first floor and one on the ground floor – the rest of the space taken up with wide verandas and staircases, the whole constructed of ancient and somewhat worm-eaten wood, which must have caused a headache to the insurance company; the bad lighting and amazing discomforts which would not be tolerated by modern schoolboys.&quot;

During this time, the enrolment soared to 300 and extensions became necessary. In 1911, the and were erected. In 1914, St. Paul&#x27;s Girls School (renamed St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College in the late 1940s) was founded by Rev. A.D. Stewart&#x27;s sister and Rev. Ernest Martin&#x27;s wife, Kathleen Stewart. Headmaster Rev. A.D. Stewart retired and his brother Colonel E. G. Stewart took charge in 1930.

===Japanese occupation===
In December 1941, the school closed abruptly when Japan invaded Hong Kong in the Pacific War. Col. Stewart, along with some school staff and students, risked their lives for the defence of the colony. After World War II, Colonel Stewart was awarded Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the Order of the British Empire (OBE) honours in 1948. He was appointed Royal Hong Kong Regiment, honorary colonel.

===Post-wars years and the Bonham Road era===

After the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the school was briefly merged with St. Paul&#x27;s Girl&#x27;s College, and renamed St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College. The school resumed its individual status in 1949, known as St. Paul&#x27;s College once again, when its campus on Bonham Road was completed. St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College remained co-educational. Rev. G.L. Speak was appointed principal in 1959.

During the Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots, Form 6 pupil Tsang Tak-sing was expelled from the school and prosecuted for distributing leaflets promoting Communism and public order crime. Tsang was sentenced to two years in prison. He later went on to become a deputy in the National People&#x27;s Congress of Communist China, a member of the Central Policy Unit and, on 1 July 2007, the Secretary for Home Affairs in the Hong Kong Government. Ha Wing Ho was appointed principal in 1969.

St. Paul&#x27;s College bloomed quickly in the late 20th century. In 1979, the completion of St. Paul&#x27;s College Alumni Association Tse Yu Chuen Swimming Pool marked the completion of one of the greatest building projects of the decade. Its construction was made possible by funding from parents, older boys and the Alumni Association.

In 1992, St. Paul&#x27;s College was the first aided school to opt for the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS). However, the scheme was eventually suspended when the government policy changed. Under DSS, the school would have been given maximum freedom with regard to curriculum, school fees and entrance requirements.

St. Paul&#x27;s College Primary School was relocated to Hill Road in 1993, which formerly housed a secondary school. The vacant block at Bonham Road was transformed into a series of special-purpose rooms including an art room, music room, staff room, teaching resource room, computer room and teachers&#x27; common room.

===2000–present===
In 2001, the college celebrated its 150th anniversary. The school elected to join the DSS, under which the school was given more autonomy in the enrolment of students, appointment of teachers and the design of the curriculum.

In 2006, the college celebrated its 155th anniversary. John Richard Kennard was appointed as the 11th principal. Under the DSS, the new South Wing was opened by Archbishop Peter Kwong. The Wong Ming Him Hall underwent renovation in 2008, while the College Hall was renovated in 2010.

A new SPC Primary School campus was built in Pok Fu Lam. The project resulted in the SPC Primary School relocating from its current site on Hill Road. Located at the corner of Victoria Road and Pok Fu Lam Road, the new campus opened in January 2013.

In 2011, the college celebrated its 160th anniversary. The Chapel Choir and Chinese Orchestra visited London in July 2011, and performed at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Southwark Cathedral and St Martin-in-the-Fields. The 160th Anniversary Concert was held on 26 October 2011 at the Jockey Club Auditorium of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

In 2014, Mr. Yuen Dick Yan, Dennis, assumed the role of Acting Principal at the college. He was subsequently appointed as Principal on an acting basis in 2015.

==The Motto, Missions and Visions==
The school motto is &quot;寅畏上主是為智之本&quot;, which is the translation of Proverbs 9:10 in classical Chinese. Its English translation is &quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom&quot; (KJV). (&quot;Timor Domini Principium Sapientiae&quot; in Latin can be found in graduation certificates of earlier days.) The fact that the motto is in Chinese is significant. While it was the fashion at the time to use Latin for such a purpose, the far-sighted founders of the school saw St. Paul&#x27;s College as a hub to foster bilinguals and to bring together the cultures of the East and the West.

The mission of St. Paul&#x27;s College is to offer modern, liberal education to Chinese youths in the English language (while including the subject of Chinese language in the curriculum) upon Christian, Protestant and Evangelical principles, as professed by the Sheng Kung Hui.

The educational goals of the college, in accordance with its mission, may be described as:
*to cultivate a healthy attitude toward life and the world, and to expose students to the Christian message;
*to instil civic awareness in students and develop them into responsible and useful citizens of the community with respect for intellectual property, human rights, freedom and justice;
*to enable students to fully develop their intellectual potential, think logically and creatively, study and solve problems independently, and communicate effectively in English and Chinese;
*to develop students&#x27; skills and abilities in information technology and an interest in lifelong learning;
*to develop students&#x27; physical and musical skills and abilities, and to encourage enjoyment in sports and music;
*to encourage the appreciation of the arts and development of artistic talents and skills;
*to promote respect for the views and opinions of others, harmonious relationships in school, the family and the community, and participation in community affairs; and
*to develop in students the ability to cope with adverse situations and emotional problems.

==The School Badge==

===The Coat of Arms===
The college&#x27;s coat of arms is similar to the coat of arms of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, indicating that St. Paul&#x27;s College is a school sponsored by the Sheng Kung Hui.

===The Scallop Shell===
The scallop shell was the emblem of St. James the Great, who was the patron saint of pilgrims. One legend describes how he travelled to Northwest Spain, and preached there for seven years. He was later beheaded in Judea by King Herod Agrippa I (Acts 12:2). According to the legend, his body was eventually taken back to Spain and buried at Santiago de Compostela. From the ninth century to the 16th century, hundreds of thousands of Christians came to Santiago de Compostela on pilgrimages, expeditions made by individuals or groups to places where God had shown His power in some special ways. Often the journeys were long and dangerous. The pilgrims did not mind, because they believed their spiritual lives would be enriched and deepened by their pilgrimage.

Often the pilgrim wore on his hat or cloak a badge indicating his destination. Those going to Santiago de Compostela wore a scallop shell. Perhaps it was a reminder of the small boats in which many of them travelled. Perhaps it had a more practical use as a vessel used in baptism or a drinking vessel. At any rate, the scallop shell eventually became a sign of pilgrimage in general, a symbol of baptism, signifying new life. The pilgrims carried new ways of thinking and of doing things to places that were deeply isolated from the larger world. Pilgrims were people on the move, people on the way to somewhere else. Like the pilgrims of old, Paulines are people on the move. When they leave school, many of them go to other parts of the world, bringing with them new ways of thinking and new ways of doing things. Even those who stay in Hong Kong are also pilgrims of a sort, for life itself is like a journey from childhood to youth, to middle age and beyond.

===The Shepherd&#x27;s Staff===
The shepherd&#x27;s staff was used by the shepherd to keep the sheep on the right path. Jesus often used this illustration in his teaching, so the shepherd&#x27;s staff has become the symbol of the care and guidance which the church minister (pastor or priest) gives to others. This care involves showing active concern for the physical, social, psychological and spiritual well-being of a person in practical ways. It is not only clergymen who show this kind of care; teachers and social workers often show this level of concern for many.

===The Key===
The key is symbolic of the words of Jesus to Peter, &quot;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven&quot; (Matthew 16:19). William Barclay, a well-known Christian author, wrote: &quot;The promise that Peter would have the keys to the Kingdom was the promise that Peter would be the means of opening the door to God for thousands upon thousands of people in the days to come. The plain fact is that it is not only Peter who has the keys of the Kingdom, every Christian has, for it is open to every one of us to open the door of the Kingdom to someone, and to enter into the great promise of Jesus Christ.&quot;

===The Open Book===
The open book symbolises the Bible – open for all to read. The Bishop of Guidford wrote: &quot;The whole Bible is a gift of God to the world. He guided its many writers and he watched over its editing and completion during many generations. For many years he has strengthened and guided his people through the pages of the Bible ... He continues to speak to us and our contemporaries as we read and study its pages.&quot; The open book also suggests knowledge.

===The Crown===
Above all of the other symbols is a crown, possibly reminiscent of the tradition that the three wise men, or Magi, who came from the east to worship the infant Jesus, were also kings. Tradition has generally supposed that they came from Persia or Arabia, but they may have come from as far away as China.

The crown may also symbolise the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him (James 1:12). &quot;The Christian,&quot; wrote William Barclay, &quot;has a royalty that other men have never realised, for, however humble his earthly circumstances, he is nothing less the child of God.&quot;

===The Cross===
In the school badge, the diocesan emblems are surrounded by a cross, which symbolises self-sacrifice, such as when Jesus died on a cross.

===The Motto===
The Chinese characters in the motto under the cross are from Proverbs 1:7, translated in English as &quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (some translations wrote knowledge. Although both are correct, the most accurate one is wisdom).&quot; The Hebrew version could be translated as &quot;The most important part of knowledge is reverence for the Lord.&quot;
The fact that the motto is in Chinese is significant. It was more the fashion at that time to use Latin for such a purpose. When St. Paul&#x27;s College was founded, the primary focus was to offer Chinese youths a modern, liberal education in the English language, while including the subject of Chinese language in the curriculum, upon Christian principles. Bringing together the cultures of East and West and the fostering of bilingualism have been well-established traditions in the school.

==List of Principals==

==Campus==
The current campus is located at 69 Bonham Road, Western District, Hong Kong.

For 100 years before World War II, St. Paul&#x27;s College was located in Glenealy (also known as &quot;Tit Kong&quot;), in the Central District, in the buildings currently called Bishop&#x27;s House, which are presently the headquarters of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui. The college buildings were occupied during the war, leading to St. Paul&#x27;s College being merged with St. Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School to form St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College (SPCC).

At the end of the occupation, St. Paul&#x27;s College was re-established in its own right and granted permission to use the former HKU St. John&#x27;s College site as its new campus. By the mid-1960s, all of the former St. John&#x27;s Hall buildings had been replaced.

===Current campus at Bonham Road===
The land (Inland Lot No. 7935) at Bonham Road on which St. Paul&#x27;s College now stand was a private property known as &quot;Fairlea&quot; in the early colonial days. In the 1880s, the small boarding school for Chinese girls founded by missionary and educator Margaret Johnstone (莊思端) moved into Fairlea. The boarding school was taken over by the Church Missionary Society in 1886 and named Fairlea Girls&#x27; School (飛利女校), and is one of the predecessors of the current Heep Yunn School.

The University of Hong Kong was formed in 1911, and in its early days, it was compulsory for all students to live in a residential hall. Being directly opposite the Main Building of HKU, Fairlea was converted into St. John&#x27;s Hall, the first hall of the newly founded university. Fairlea Girls&#x27; School moved to 4–6 Babington Path as a result. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, St. John&#x27;s Hall was occupied by an infantry company and also acted as a shelter for local Anglo-Indian and Eurasian refugees, and the Hall was extensively looted after the surrender of Japan. As HKU recommenced classes in 1946, St. John&#x27;s Hall reopened in 1947 with the aid from the Education Department, with the condition that the latter could use the West Wing of St. John&#x27;s Hall, location of which is now SPC&#x27;s Stewart Building. The affiliated primary school of Northcote Training College soon moved in. When SPC regained its independence in 1950, it initially occupied the West Wing as well.

The Anglican Church proposed merging St. John&#x27;s Hall with St. Stephen&#x27;s Hall, a female-only hall, into the co-educational St. John&#x27;s College (SJC). SJC subsequently moved into its new premises at 82 Pokfulam Road in 1955, leaving the whole premises at Bonham Road for St. Paul&#x27;s College&#x27;s use. The Wong Ming Him Hall, the oldest building existing in the campus nowadays, was built in 1951. The three-storey, multi-purpose building once housed a table tennis room, art room and music room. The building was renovated in 2007–2008 and now houses a multi-purpose rehearsal room, a board room and the archives. The college swimming pool, known in full as &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s College Alumni Association Tse Yu Chuen Swimming Pool&quot; (聖保羅書院同學會謝雨川游泳池), was officially opened on 8 November 1979. The pool is next to the Wong Ming Him Hall and was named after the alumnus who initiated the fundraising campaign for its construction.

The original St. John&#x27;s Hall building as well as Wong Ming Him Hall was deemed inadequate owing to the college&#x27;s rapid growth, to an extent that AM PM double-shift schooling was adopted in 1961 and 1962. As a result, the college started the planning of a thorough campus redevelopment scheme with alumnus-cum-architect Szeto Wai (司徒惠) in 1962, and construction started in the same year. The old St. John&#x27;s Hall building was torn down and replaced by four new blocks, namely the North Wing, East Wing and West Wing (now renamed Stewart Building), as well as the now demolished Primary School Block. This layout remained unchanged until the 2000s, when the college carried out a School Improvement programme.

====School Improvement Programme====

In 2003, the college implemented a School Improvement Programme (SIP) with a view to construct a new administration and teaching block above the swimming pool area. To make way for the new building, the college demolished the former primary school building.

The intake of the New South Wing occurred in October 2006, and was officially opened by Peter Kwong Kong-kit, the then Archbishop of Hong Kong, on 15 December of the same year. It houses the college office, a principal&#x27;s room, art rooms, music rooms and staff rooms.

===Primary school campus===

In 1993, St. Paul&#x27;s College Primary School (SPC-PS) moved to its own campus at 70 Hill Road, which formerly housed Hill Road Government Primary School (before 1977), Buddhist Chi Hong College (1977–1990) and Lok Sin Tong Leung Kau Kui College (1991–1992).

In addition to 18 classrooms, the Hill Road campus included a school hall, conference room, music room, computer room, library, multi-purpose room, English language room, counselling room, first aid room, visual arts and science room, chapel and tuck shop.

A new campus for SPCPS was completed in 2012, and SPCPS moved in subsequently. The new campus is located at the junction of Pok Fu Lam Road and Victoria Road near Wah Fu Estate in Pok Fu Lam. The vacated Hill Road campus is handed over to SKH St. Peter&#x27;s Primary School, another primary school sponsored by Sheng Kung Hui, enabling the latter&#x27;s conversion to whole day operation.

==Students&#x27; Organisation==

===The Prefects&#x27; Council===
The Prefects&#x27; Council is an independent organisation which is authorised by the principal to help maintain school discipline. A prefect presents himself as a role model to others. Prefects are privileged, entitled to wear the prefects&#x27; tie and read Bible at the school morning assembly, which is regarded as a prestige. The prefect&#x27;s main duties include maintaining discipline at the school and promoting harmony among Paulians. The Prefects&#x27; Council runs a committee system under the direction of the head prefect and two-second head prefects. The council is also responsible for co-ordinating all functions held by the school and students&#x27; association upon request. Prefects have the right to issue warning sheets according to the seriousness of the offence. Outstanding Prefects are chosen each year based on their general routine and performance of external duties.

===Students&#x27; Association===

The St. Paul&#x27;s College Students&#x27; Association (abbreviated as SA) is the students&#x27; organisation of the college. It is the main body which conducts matters concerning students&#x27; welfare and communication with the school. The SA is the oldest students&#x27; organisation in all secondary schools in Hong Kong.

The Executive Council (EC) is the decision-making body of the Students&#x27; Association. Executive Council committees include:
* Affiliated Clubs Committee (ACC) – helps all clubs in financial need and in other matters such as club registration. There are 53 affiliated clubs under the students&#x27; association.
* Audit Committee – monitors the income and expenditure of the Students&#x27; Association.
* Human Resources Committee (HR) – responsible for arrangement of the SA officials&#x27; duty for daily operation and the association&#x27;s activities.
* Public Relations Committee (PR) – responsible for liaison with external bodies or schools.
* Welfare Committee – provides welfare services such as sale of tie clips, umbrella rental service, old books and stationery.
* Promotion Committee - coordinates the promotion work of the SA .

The Students&#x27; Association is led by the SA president. At the beginning of each school year, an SA presidential election is held. All students vote for a candidate, and the term of office for each president is one school year.

====Affiliated Clubs of the Students&#x27; Association====
The Students’ Association (S.A.) organises a Sponsored Walk each year to raise funds for financing the activities of its 53 affiliated clubs, which are grouped under six unions: Arts Union, Science Union, Sports Union, Music Union, Recreation Union and Service Union.

The Arts Union and the Science Union organise the Arts Week and the Science Week respectively, with such programmes as book and club exhibitions, and inter-class competitions. In addition, the Science Union participates in the Joint School Science Exhibition during the summer holidays every year.

The school provides many opportunities for students to participate in community services through the service clubs or groups such as the Interact Club, the Community Youth Club, the Junior Police Call, the Youth Red Cross and the Scout Group. Social services include collecting toys and second-hand clothes, participating in fundraising walkathons and flag-selling activities for charitable purposes, organising funfairs for the mentally disabled, and paying visits to the homes for the aged.

The Recreation Union comprises many clubs for students with various interests, including Green Club, Transport Club, Photography Club and Bridge Club.

===House system===
The House System was first introduced in 1975. The college offers students additional opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities, in the form of the House System, which aims at bridging the gap between junior and senior students, and moving the students beyond the limit of class spirit.

Membership of each house comes from all parts of the school so that within each class there are members of six houses, which are designated as Banyan, Ginkgo, Oak, Pine, Rosewood and Yew. The system facilitates inter-house ball games and competitions in the Swimming Gala and the Sport Days. Apart from participating in sports competitions, members of the six houses also show their talents in inter-house music, debating and drama contests.

The colour of each house corresponds with the first letter of the house name.

Each house is led by a house master, and a number of assistant house masters or mistresses. The events at the Annual Sports Day and Swimming Gala are mostly inter-house events, with the exception of a few inter-class events. Most competitions between the houses are sports competitions, while academic ones are rare.

Newly admitted F.1 students are randomly distributed among the six houses. House members may purchase and wear house badges on a voluntary basis.

In the 2022–2023 academic year, the &quot;Best Cheering Team&quot; award in both the Annual Swimming Gala and the Annual Sports Day was captured by Oak House. The house is regarded as the &quot;Cheering Champion&quot;.

==College Song and Hymn==

The old college song was titled &quot;The Old St. Paul&#x27;s College&quot;, based on the 18th century ballad &quot;John Peel&quot;.

The current college song was composed in the 1970s by Rev. Moses Wu, the music teacher at the time, with lyrics by C.F. Miles. It is generally sung during major college events such as Speech Day, the Swimming Gala and Sports Day. The college song is played by the college orchestra at Speech Day.

The College Hymn, &quot;We Build Our School on Thee, O Lord&quot;, is also sung during important services and at morning assemblies.

===College Song Clapping Controversy===

It has been a norm for the students of St. Paul&#x27;s College to clap at the College Song&#x27;s penultimate sentence, i.e. right after &quot;Down the years we will be faithful&quot;. The norm is rumored to have originated in the 1980s primary school section of St. Paul&#x27;s College, which spread to the secondary school section as tens of primary school section&#x27;s students were directly promoted annually.

According to retired Careers Master Mr. W. F. Ryan, a student in 1986 forgot some lyrics of the College Song and substituted them by clapping. Other students followed suit and normalized it. Mr. Raymond Y. K. Fu, Head of Music Department from 1981 to 2013, had opposed such act as he deemed it &quot;disrespectful&quot;. It nonetheless continued for over ten years until 2006, when Dr. J. R. Kennard - the principal succeeding Mr. Timothy W. H. Ha - announced a ban on his first morning assembly, arguing that the clapping goes against the school&#x27;s traditions and he needed to do so &quot;at the request of the alumni association&quot;. Dr. J.R. Kennard retracted his position later as he realized that the clapping is a manifestation of loyalty.

Dr. J.R. Kennard explained the ban was merely enforced during public events, such as Sports Day and Speech Day (graduation ceremony). Five years after he first announced the ban, Dr. Kennard announced on 8 July 2011 that the ban would be lifted one off during the end-of-term assembly. However, on 1 September 2011, students continued the clapping - signalling the end of the ban once and for all. Ever since, the clapping has occurred whenever the College Song is sung. As of 9 July 2021 – 10 years from the ban&#x27;s end – current principal Dr. Dennis Yuen does not show any objection, and the students still clapped at the end of the College Song in the end-of-term assembly. From now on, it is still clapped at the end of the song.

==Class structure and curriculum==

===Class structure===
There are six classes in each form (Form 1–6). St. Paul&#x27;s College uses English as the medium of instruction.

The college traditionally followed a system of education similar to Britain. In 2009, the New Senior Secondary system was introduced across the Hong Kong SAR. This involved moving away from the English model of seven years secondary schooling to the Chinese model of three years of junior secondary plus three years of senior secondary. The two public examinations HKCEE and HKALE are now replaced by a single public examination called the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). In addition to the HKDSE, the college also offers the GCE A-Level examinations to provide more opportunities for students.

===Curriculum===
For the first three years of school (Form 1–Form 3), various subjects are introduced to students, including English, Chinese, Putonghua, Mathematics, Integrated Humanities (which is composed of Geography, History, and Life and Society), Integrated Science, Information and Communication Technology, Religious Studies, Music and Visual Arts. Integrated Science is replaced with Physics, Chemistry and Biology in Form 3.

Under the New Senior Secondary (NSS) educational structure, senior form students now choose three elective subjects in which to specialise, together with the compulsory subjects of Chinese, English, Mathematics, Citizenship and Social Development, as well as the school based Common Core, which researches on sustainability and a better city. As of the 2022-23 academic year, Chinese History, Chinese Literature, Biology, Business, Accounting and Financial Studies (BAFS), Chemistry, Economics, Ethics and Religious Studies, Geography, History, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Music, Physics and Visual Arts (VA) are offered by the college as elective subjects.

The college also runs a bridging course for newly admitted Form 1 students to improve their foundation in English and link their already-possessed knowledge with the new ones. There are also remedial classes in Chinese, English and Mathematics for students requiring additional assistance.

==College Publications==
The college&#x27;s Student Publications Council (學生出版社) is responsible for the publication of &quot;Wayfarer&quot;, the college magazine, and &quot;Scope&quot;, the college newspaper. Formerly regarded as part of the Students&#x27; Association, the council has always been a separate entity.

===Wayfarer===
&quot;Wayfarer&quot; () is the school magazine of St. Paul&#x27;s College, serving the function as a yearbook. The issue for each academic year is published in December of the following school year.

The name &quot;Wayfarer&quot;, which means &quot;a traveller on foot,&quot; symbolises achieving dreams by eliminating obstacles; the Chinese name, 弘道, is derived from the quote &quot;人能弘道，非道弘人&quot; (&quot;A man can enlarge the principles which he follows; those principles do not enlarge the man.&quot;) taken from the Book of Wei Ling Kung in the &quot;Confucian Analects&quot;.

The aims of publishing &quot;Wayfarer&quot;, as stated in its inaugural issue (1957–58), are:
* To organise systematically a history record of the college for future reference;
* To provide with students and teachers a platform of voicing out what they think, so that their talents can be seen;
* To compile a collection of excellent works so as to encourage and inspire the future generations.

&quot;Wayfarer&quot; was first published in 1958, but was subsequently suspended until 1963, when the college started to publish &quot;Wayfarer&quot; annually. Each issue is prepared by an editorial board formed by students, under the supervision of teacher advisors, since the 4th issue (1965–66) – the first three issues were prepared entirely by teachers.

Printed in black-and-white for more than 40 years, the first &quot;Wayfarer&quot; in colour, Issue 45, was published for the 2006–2007 academic year (155th Anniversary of the college). As of December 2013, &quot;Wayfarer&quot; has published 51 issues.

&quot;Wayfarer&quot; is a bilingual publication. Contents include college report, photographs of classes and groups, club reports, features and contributions.

Other than Wayfarer, the college also composes a book with passages written by students throughout the term.

==Activities and achievements==

===Academic===
The HKCEE and HKALE results of the school are sound with a very high percentage of students reaching the entrance requirements for local university and matriculation degrees.
With the start of new examination, HKDSE, there is still a very high percentage of students meeting general requirements (33222) for local undergraduate university programmes.
Besides local universities, the school provides chances to apply international examinations, like IGCSE, GCE. Students are able to enter foreign universities through international examination.

==St. Paul&#x27;s College Alumni Association==
St. Paul&#x27;s College Alumni Association was established in 1920. There was no official name by the time it was established. By 1930, It was recorded that more than 100 alumni and the management of school was in a restaurant in the Sheung Wan to discuss the establishment of &quot;Old Pauline Union&quot;, followed by students in Guangzhou and Shanghai and other places setting up a branch with a view to contacting alumni.

During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, Macao was the temporarily place where alumni gatherings took place. Until 1950, the Bonham Road school complex was completed, students were to be given a formal name for the &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s College Alumni Association&quot; (SPCAA). The role of the SPCAA had also changed, been taking a leading role in addition to serve merely as the links between the alumni, the SPCAA will also continue to maintain contact with the school, there are four alumni representative in the College Council, together for the deliberations in school affairs.

Past Students had been actively support the alma mater of the building over the years, and had repeatedly launched campaign donations. Without the alumni support the new library, swimming pool, school auditorium air conditioning works at the Bonham Road Campus would not have been that successful. The strong alumni donations has made the new school expansion in the 1950s and 2000s possible with the professional advice by alumni of the famous architect (Patrick Lau, etc.).

Many alumni and students will also contribute to the school to set up multiple scholarships and awards funds to reward academic achievement and excellent performance of the students. In addition, SPCAA has published &quot;From Devotion at the 150th anniversary celebration to Plurality: A full history of St. Paul&#x27;s College 1851–2001&quot; — a book to commemorate the school 150 years of development.

<text>The reputation or prestige of a social entity (a person, a social group, an organization, or a place) is an opinion about that entity – typically developed as a result of social evaluation on a set of criteria, such as behavior or performance.

Reputation is a , , and highly efficient mechanism of social control. It is a subject of study in social, management, and technological sciences. Its influence ranges from competitive settings, like markets, to cooperative ones, like firms, organizations, institutions and communities. Furthermore, reputation acts on different levels of agency: individual and supra-individual. At the supra-individual level, it concerns groups, communities, collectives and abstract social entities (such as firms, corporations, organizations, countries, cultures and even civilizations). It affects phenomena of different scales, from everyday life to relationships between nations. Reputation is a fundamental instrument of social order, based upon distributed, spontaneous social control.

The concept of reputation is considered important in business, politics, education, online communities, and many other fields, and it may be considered as a reflection of a social entity&#x27;s identity.

==Corporate reputation==

=== Reputation as a concept for companies ===

==== Academic literature ====
Since 1980, the study of &#x27;corporate reputation&#x27; has attracted growing scholarly attention from economics, sociology, and management. The concept of reputation has undergone substantial evolution in the academic literature over the past several decades. Terminology such as reputation, branding, image and identity is often used interchangeably in both the popular press and – until recently – in the academic literature, as well.

The academic literature has generally settled on a small cluster of perspectives on &quot;what reputation is&quot; in a company context. 
Mark C. Suchman (1995) examines the relationship between legitimacy, status, and reputation, emphasizing that while these concepts are interconnected, they represent distinct forms of social evaluation. Legitimacy refers to the degree to which an organization&#x27;s actions align with societal norms and values, status reflects its position within a social hierarchy, and reputation is based on assessments of its past actions and achievements. Understanding these distinctions is essential for organizations seeking to navigate their social environments successfully.

Economists use game-theory to describe corporate reputations as strategic signals that companies use to convey to markets some of their qualities and abilities. Sociologists view corporate reputation as descriptions of the relative status that companies occupy in an institutional field of rivals and stakeholders. Management scholars describe corporate reputations in one of two main ways, including:

*the broad view: as an aggregation of perceptions that form as audiences judge the behaviors of companies.
** This is often evaluated by broad ranking measures of the company as a whole, such as the Fortune &quot;Most Admired Companies&quot; rankings
*the specific view: as an assessment, by some specific audience, of the company&#x27;s ability to perform or behave in a certain way. These are split into two broad categories: (a) outcome/capability reputation and (b) behavior/character reputation, which is intended to capture both the economic and sociological forms of reputation.
** (a) outcome/capability reputation: this reputation type involves an assessment of how &quot;well&quot; the company performs on a certain dimension. The most common examples of these is performing well financially or providing high quality products or services. All of these dimensions can be objectively ordered, such as better/worse financial performance (as evaluated by objective, market-based measures of financial performance) or better/worse product quality (as evaluated by a collection of users).
** (b) behavior/character reputation: this reputation type is said to arise when a company is recognized as &quot;consistently&quot; &quot;behaving&quot; in a certain way, in a manner that is relatively devoid of objectively identifiable performance. For instance, a company might prioritize investment in innovation, the improvement of its operational efficiency, or sourcing from local suppliers.

==== Practical measurement of reputation ====
In practice, corporate reputations are revealed by the relative rankings of companies created and propagated by information intermediaries. For example, business magazines and newspapers such as &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Business Week&quot;, &quot;Financial Times&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; regularly publish lists of the best places to work, the best business schools, or the most innovative companies. These rankings are explicit orderings of corporate reputations, and the relative positions of companies on these rankings reflect their relative performance on various cognitive attributes. Corporate reputations are found to influence the attractiveness of ranked companies as suppliers of products, as prospective employers, and as investments. For those reasons, companies themselves have become increasingly involved with the practice of reputation management.

=== Connections to related, company-level concepts ===
Like any social construct, reputation is similar to (i.e., convergent with) certain concepts and different (i.e., discriminant) from others. Reputation can be compared to other &quot;social evaluation&quot; or &quot;social judgment&quot; constructs. For instance, reputation is said to be convergent with adjacent concepts like corporate image, identity, celebrity, status, legitimacy, social approval (likability), and visibility (prominence), but discriminant from related constructs like stigma and infamy. Reputation is often considered to be a pragmatic evaluation – actors determine whether the target of the evaluation can be seen as useful to them.

Until recently, the relationships with these adjacent constructs were merely theoretical; that is, they were not formally tested or empirically validated for their &quot;nomological relationships&quot; with these other, related constructs.

*Conceptual relationships: In 2012, the &quot;Oxford Handbook of Corporate Reputation&quot; was released to provide some clarity to the increasingly fragmented field of social evaluation constructs, all of which had been referred to (either implicitly or explicitly) under an umbrella of &quot;reputation&quot; concepts. In 2020, the introductory part of &quot;The Power of Being Divisive: Understanding Negative Evaluations&quot;, develops a framework to disentangle a variety of concepts in the field of social evaluations – in particular making the point that negative and positive evaluations can be on different continua, and social actors can be both positively and negatively evaluated at the same time. In this opus and in the Oxford handbook, scholars made incremental efforts to distinguish between handfuls of these constructs, such as:
** reputation vs. celebrity
** reputation vs. status
** reputation vs. legitimacy vs. status
** reputation vs. social approval
** reputation vs. stigma
** reputation vs. status vs. celebrity vs. stigma
*Empirical relationships: In 2020, Bitektine and colleagues conducted the first major construct validation study to: (a) create scales for the constructs of reputation, cognitive legitimacy, sociopolitical legitimacy, and status, and (b) empirically distinguish between them by undertaking a multiple studies involving several confirmatory factor analyses. 
** This construct validation effort addressed the &quot;broad view&quot; of reputation as a company-level evaluation (not an evaluation for specific attributes). The scale items for reputation that resulted from this effort, as evaluated by an audience of respondents representing the general public, included: &quot;The reputation of this company is excellent&quot;, &quot;[this] is a reputable company&quot;, and &quot;[this] is a dependable company&quot;.
** There still exists no construct validation effort for the &quot;specific view&quot; of reputation (i.e., that reputation is best understood as a specific audience&#x27;s view of the company with respect to a specific attribute).

=== Consequences ===

==== Performance outcomes ====
Myriad reputation studies from the 1980s to the 2000s demonstrated that a company&#x27;s reputation was positively related to various performance measures, such as financial success and profitability. However, more recent work demonstrated that reputation can be both &quot;a benefit and a burden&quot;, suggesting that &quot;the bigger you are, the harder you (might) fall&quot; with respect to reputation.

==== Decision outcomes ====
Relatedly, researchers have theorized or demonstrated that a company&#x27;s reputation could also influence the decisions and perceptions of its managers; in some cases, reputation can promote the use of risk-reduction strategies by managers as they seek to preserve the reputation they have cultivated. In other cases, researchers argue that reputation can embolden managers to take risks in areas unrelated to their reputation, since stakeholders may be focused on the reputation itself and inattentive to other areas of the company.

== Topics relating to reputation ==

===Reputation management===

Many organizations create public relations and corporate communication departments dedicated to assisting companies with reputation management. In addition, many public relations and consulting firms claim expertise in reputation management. The growth of the public relations industry has largely been due to the rising demand for companies to establish credibility and reputation. Incidents which damage a company&#x27;s reputation for honesty or safety may cause serious damage to finances. For example, in 1999 Coca-Cola lost $60 million (by its own estimate) after schoolchildren reported suffering from symptoms like headaches, nausea and shivering after drinking its products.

Although most companies see reputation management as a central part of a CEO&#x27;s role, managing reputation involves a set of ongoing activities that are best managed when they are delegated to a specific individual in the organization. This is why some companies have created the position of chief reputation officer (CRO). A growing number of people in the business world now have the word &quot;reputation&quot; in their titles – including Dow Chemical, SABMiller, Coca-Cola, Allstate, Repsol YPF, Weber Shandwick, and GlaxoSmithKline (although no longer). Hoover&#x27;s shows a list of such officers.

Social media like Twitter, Linked In, and Facebook have made it increasingly important for companies to monitor their online reputations in order to anticipate and respond to criticisms of their actions. There are two main routes that customers can take when complaining about companies: individual-direct response or broadcast-based response. For a company, it takes a lot of time and effort to address individual-direct responses. One study showed that &quot;...72% of customers expect a reply within one hour.&quot; In order to best recover from negative complaints on social media, it is important for a company to prove its authenticity by providing more specific answers directly to its critics.

===Reputation capital===

A corporate reputation can be managed, accumulated and traded in for trust, legitimization of a position of power and social recognition, and people are prepared to pay a premium price for goods and services offered, which in turn generates higher customer loyalty, a stronger willingness from shareholders to hold on to shares in times of crisis, and greater likelihood to invest in the company&#x27;s stock. Therefore, reputation is one of the most valuable forms of &quot;capital&quot; of a company. &quot;Delivering functional and social expectations of the public on the one hand and manage to build a unique identity on the other hand creates trust and this trust builds the informal framework of a company. This framework provides &quot;return in cooperation&quot; and produces reputation capital. A positive reputation will secure a company or organisation long-term competitive advantages. The higher a company&#x27;s reputation capital, the lower the costs of supervising and exercising control.&quot;

===Building reputation through stakeholder management===
According to stakeholder theory, corporations should be managed for the benefit of all their &quot;stakeholders,&quot; not just their shareholders. Stakeholders of a company include any individual or group that can influence or is influenced by a company&#x27;s practices. The stakeholders of a company can be suppliers, consumers, employees, shareholders, financial community, government, and media. Companies must properly manage the relationships between stakeholder groups and they must consider the interest(s) of each stakeholder group carefully. Therefore, it becomes essential to integrate public relations into corporate governance to manage the relationships between these stakeholders which will enhance the organization&#x27;s reputation. Corporations or institutions which behave ethically and govern in a good manner build reputational capital which is a competitive advantage. A good reputation enhances profitability because it attracts customers to products, investors to securities and employees to its jobs. A company&#x27;s reputation is an intangible asset and a source of competitive advantage against rivals because the company will be viewed as more reliable, credible, trustworthy and responsible to its employees, customers, shareholders and financial markets.

In addition, according to MORI&#x27;s survey of about 200 managers in the private sector, 99%
responded that the management of corporate reputation is very (83%) or fairly (16%) important. Reputation is a reflection of companies&#x27; culture and identity. Also, it is the outcome of managers&#x27; efforts to prove their success and excellence. It is sustained through acting reliably, credibly, trustworthily and responsibly in the market. It can be sustained through consistent communication activities both internally and externally with key stakeholder groups. This directly influences a public company&#x27;s stock prices in the financial market. Therefore, this reputation makes a reputational capital that becomes a strategic asset and advantage for that company. As a consequence, public relations must be used in order to establish long lasting relationships with the stakeholders, which will enhance the reputation of the company.

===Causes and consequences===
Reputation models can be placed in a broader framework that distinguishes reputation from its underlying causes and from its consequences. This approach is important to clarify the meaning of reputation. 
*Causes of reputation are seen to reside in stakeholder experiences. Stakeholder experiences relate to a company&#x27;s day-to-day business operations, its branding and marketing and &quot;noise&quot; in the system, such as the media and word of mouth. Further causes of reputation may include the perceived innovativeness of a company, the customers&#x27; expectations, the (perceived) quality of the company&#x27;s goods and services and the subsequent customer satisfaction, all of which differ according to the respective customers&#x27; cultural background.
*The consequences of reputation reside in the behaviors (supportive or resistant) that stakeholders demonstrate towards a company. Behaviors such as advocacy, commitment, and cooperation are key positive outcomes of a good reputation. Boycotts and lawsuits are key negative outcomes of a bad reputation.

===Reputation recovery/repair===
Organizations frequently make missteps that cause them to lose the positive regard of stakeholders. In the wake of studies addressing the disproportionate penalties that accrue to high reputation firms when they make such missteps, reputation researchers have proposed models to account for both reputation damage and reputation repair, summarizing prior work in disciplines including economics, marketing, accounting, and management.

===Reputation transfer===
In the context of brand extension strategies, many companies rely on reputation transfer as a means of transferring the good reputation of a company and its existing products to new markets and new products. Consumers who are already familiar with other products of an established brand, exhibiting customer satisfaction and loyalty, will more easily accept new products of the same brand. In contrast to brand extension, the general concept of reputation transfer also requires the transfer of a company&#x27;s values and identity to the new products and/or services and the related brands when entering new markets. It is important, however, to pay attention to the image fit between preexisting and new brands, for this factor has been proven to be critical for the success of brand extensions. In contrast to the special case of brand extension, the general concept of reputation transfer also requires the transfer of the values and identity of a company to the new products and/or services and the related brands when entering new markets. A strong image might therefore even hamper the introduction of new product lines if customers do not associate the competences relevant to the new market/category/product line with the existing company or brand.
A company&#x27;s reputation is furthermore influenced by culture, as nationalities differ with regard to how valued specific aspects of the company&#x27;s brand identity are in the respective national culture (e.g. environmental concerns or work ethics) as well as with regard to popular cultural dimensions (e.g. Hofstede). Subsequently, these differences impact the success of reputation transfer significantly.

== Cognitive view of reputation ==

The cognitive view of reputation has become increasingly prominent in reputation research. It has led to improved understanding of the role played by reputation in a number of practical domains and scientific fields. In the study of cooperation and social dilemmas, for instance, the role of reputation as a partner selection mechanism started to be appreciated in the early 1980s.

Working toward such a definition, reputation can be viewed as a socially transmitted meta-belief (i.e., belief about belief) that is a property of an agent, that results from the attitudes other actors have about some socially desirable behaviour, be it cooperation, reciprocity, or norm-compliance. Reputation plays a crucial role in the evolution of these behaviours: reputation transmission allows socially desirable behaviour to spread. Rather than concentrating on the property only, the cognitive model of reputation accounts not only for reputation-formation but also for the propagation of reputation.

To model this aspect, it is necessary to specify and develop a more refined classification of reputation. In informal settings, gossip, although vague, may contain precious hints both to facts (&quot;I&#x27;ve been told this physician has shown questionable behavior&quot;) and to conflicts taking place at the information level (if a candidate for a role spreads defamatory information about another candidate, whom should you trust?).

Moreover, the expression &quot;it is said that John Smith is a cheater&quot; is intrinsically a reputation spreading act, because on one hand it refers to a (possibly false) common opinion, and on the other the very act of saying &quot;it is said&quot; is self-assessing, since it provides at least one factual occasion when that something is said, because the person who says so (the gossiper), while appearing to spread the saying a bit further, may actually be in the phase of initiating it.

Gossip can also be used as an identifier only – as when gossiping about unreachable icons, like royalty or showbiz celebrities – useful only to show the gossiper belongs to the group of the informed ones. While most cases seem to share the characteristic of being primarily used to predict future behavior, they can have, for example, manipulative sub-goals, even more important than the forecast.

In the case of a communication between two parties, one (the advisee) that is requesting advice about the potential for danger in a financial transaction with another party (the potential partner, target), and the other (the adviser, evaluator) that is giving advice. Roughly speaking, the advice could fall under one of the following three categories :

# the adviser declares it believes the potential partner is (is not) good for the transaction in object;
# the adviser declares it believes another (named or otherwise defined) agent or set of agents believes the potential partner is (is not) good for the transaction in object;
# the adviser declares it believes in an undefined set of agents, hence there is a belief the potential partner is (is not) good for the transaction in object.

Note the care to maintain the possible levels of truth (the adviser declares – but could be lying – it believes – but could be wrong – etc..). The cases are listed, as it is evident, in decreasing order of responsibility. While one could feel most actual examples fall under the first case, the other two are not unnecessarily complicated nor actually infrequent. Indeed, most of the common gossip falls under the third category, and, except for electronic interaction, this is the most frequent form of referral. All examples concern the evaluation of a given object (target), a social agent (which may be either individual or supra-individual, and in the latter case, either a group or a collective), held by another social agent, the evaluator.

The examples above can be turned into more precise definitions using the concept of social evaluation. At this point, we can propose to coin a new lexical item, &quot;image&quot;, whose character should be immediately evident and is clearly linked to reputation.

=== Image ===
Image is a global or averaged evaluation of a given target on the part of an agent. It consists of (a set of) social evaluations about the characteristics of the target. Image as an object of communication is what is exchanged in examples 1 and 2, above. In the second case, we call it third-party image. It may concern a subset of the target&#x27;s characteristics, i.e., its willingness to comply with socially accepted norms and customs, or its skills (ways), or its definition as pertaining to a precise agent. Indeed, we can define special cases of image, including third-party image, the evaluation that an agent believes a third party has of the target, or even shared image, that is, an evaluation shared by a group. Not even this last is reputation, since it tries to define too precisely the mental status of the group.

Reputation, as distinct from image, is the process and the effect of transmitting a target image. We call reputation transmission a communication of an evaluation without the specification of the evaluator, if not for a group attribution, and only in the default sense discussed before. This covers the case of example 3 above. More precisely, reputation is a believed, social, meta-evaluation; it is built upon three distinct but interrelated objects :
# a cognitive representation, or more precisely a believed evaluation – this could be somebody&#x27;s image, but is enough that this consist of a communicated evaluation;
# a population object, i.e., a propagating believed evaluation; and
# an objective emergent property at the agent level, i.e., what the agent is believed to be.

In fact, reputation is a highly dynamic phenomenon in two distinct senses: it is subject to change, especially as an effect of corruption, errors, deception, etc.; and it emerges as an effect of a multi-level bidirectional process. Reputation is also how others know and perceive you as an individual.

While &quot;image&quot; only moves (when transmitted and accepted) from one individual cognition to another, the anonymous character of reputation makes it a more complex phenomenon. Reputation proceeds from the level of individual cognition (when is born, possibly as an image, but not always) to the level of social propagation (at this level, it not necessarily believed as from any specific agent) and from this level back to individual cognition again (when it is accepted).

Moreover, once it gets to the population level, reputation gives rise to a further property at the agent level. It is both what people think about targets and what targets are in the eyes of others. From the very moment an agent is targeted by the community, his or her life will change whether he or she wants it or not or believes it or not. Reputation has become the immaterial, more powerful equivalent of a scarlet letter sewed to one&#x27;s clothes. It is more powerful because it may not even be perceived by the individual to whom it sticks, and consequently it is out of the individual&#x27;s power to control and manipulate.

More simply speaking for those who want a working definition of reputation, reputation is the sum of impressions held by a company&#x27;s stakeholders. In other words, reputation is in the &quot;eyes of the beholder&quot;. It need not be just a company&#x27;s reputation but could be the reputation of an individual, country, brand, political party, industry. But the key point in reputation is not what the leadership insists but what others perceive it to be. For a company, its reputation is how esteemed it is in the eyes of its employees, customers, investors, talent, candidates, competitors, analysts, alumni, regulators and the list goes on.

==Online==

Online reputation plays a crucial role in online communities where trust is a key factor. Platforms like eBay implement customer feedback systems to publicly rate users, while Amazon.com employs a similar review system to assess seller credibility. Additionally, establishing and maintaining a strong reputation serves as a significant motivator for individuals to actively engage in online communities.

Individuals employ monitoring to ensure that they keep up with their online reputation. Given the number of sites on the Internet, it is impossible to manually monitor the entire web for pages that may affect one&#x27;s online reputation. Free tools such as Google Alerts can be used to keep track of online reputations on a small scale, while larger businesses and clients may use more powerful analytics to monitor online interactions and mentions.

Paid tools for online reputation management focus on either brand protection or online reputation. These tools track mentions of a brand or product on the Internet, on Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and other social networking sites and websites.

Online reputation is determined by how effectively it is managed. The term digital reputation (or web reputation) is used to emphasize its broader scope, as it extends beyond online interactions to influence an individual’s or company’s overall public perception. It is important to distinguish online reputation from a company&#x27;s digital identity, which refers specifically to its online presence and branding. Indeed, digital or web reputation does not concern the virtual online reputation only, but the whole real reputation of a person or a company as it is affected by the Internet. Online reputation, furthermore, should not be confused with a company&#x27;s digital identity.

An online reputation is the perception that one generates on the Internet based on their digital footprint. Digital footprints accumulate through all of the content shared, feedback provided, and information that is created online. Due to the fact that if someone has a bad online reputation, they can easily change their pseudonym, new accounts on sites such as eBay or Amazon are usually distrusted. If an individual or company wants to manage their online reputation, they will face many more difficulties.

According to one study, 84% of responding business leaders saw the greatest reputation threat online to companies as negative media coverage. The next two greatest threats are customer complaints in the media or on grievance sites online (71%) and negative word of mouth (54%). This negative word of mouth could come not only from dissatisfied customers but from employees as well. With the power of business review websites and customer forums, a company&#x27;s online reputation can be damaged anonymously.
Employers have begun using the online reputations of job applicants to guide their hiring choices. By checking a candidate&#x27;s social networking profiles on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, employers gain insight into a candidate&#x27;s character and suitability for a job.

Some individuals and organizations hire reputation management companies to attempt to hide truthful but unflattering information about themselves. A recent alleged example is that of Dr. Anil Potti, who resigned from Duke University after it was discovered that he had misrepresented himself on his resume and became the subject of a scientific misconduct investigation.

<doc id="233011" wikidata="Q1779327" url="?curid=233011" title="Optimistic concurrency control">
<text>Optimistic concurrency control (OCC), also known as optimistic locking, is a non-locking concurrency control method applied to transactional systems such as relational database management systems and software transactional memory. OCC assumes that multiple transactions can frequently complete without interfering with each other. While running, transactions use data resources without acquiring locks on those resources. Before committing, each transaction verifies that no other transaction has modified the data it has read. If the check reveals conflicting modifications, the committing transaction rolls back and can be restarted. Optimistic concurrency control was first proposed in 1979 by H. T. Kung and John T. Robinson.

OCC is generally used in environments with low data contention. When conflicts are rare, transactions can complete without the expense of managing locks and without having transactions wait for other transactions&#x27; locks to clear, leading to higher throughput than other concurrency control methods. However, if contention for data resources is frequent, the cost of repeatedly restarting transactions hurts performance significantly, in which case other concurrency control methods may be better suited. However, locking-based (&quot;pessimistic&quot;) methods also can deliver poor performance because locking can drastically limit effective concurrency even when deadlocks are avoided.

== Phases of optimistic concurrency control ==
Optimistic concurrency control transactions involve these phases:
*Begin: Record a timestamp marking the transaction&#x27;s beginning.
*Modify: Read database values, and tentatively write changes.
*Validate: Check whether other transactions have modified data that this transaction has used (read or written). This includes transactions that completed after this transaction&#x27;s start time, and optionally, transactions that are still active at validation time.
*Commit/Rollback: If there is no conflict, make all changes take effect. If there is a conflict, resolve it, typically by aborting the transaction, although other resolution schemes are possible. Care must be taken to avoid a time-of-check to time-of-use bug, particularly if this phase and the previous one are not performed as a single atomic operation.

==Web usage==
The stateless nature of HTTP makes locking infeasible for web user interfaces. It is common for a user to start editing a record, then leave without following a &quot;cancel&quot; or &quot;logout&quot; link. If locking is used, other users who attempt to edit the same record must wait until the first user&#x27;s lock times out.

HTTP does provide a form of built-in OCC. The response to an initial GET request can include an ETag for subsequent PUT requests to use in the If-Match header. Any PUT requests with an out-of-date ETag in the If-Match header can then be rejected.

Some database management systems offer OCC natively, without requiring special application code. For others, the application can implement an OCC layer outside of the database, and avoid waiting or silently overwriting records. In such cases, the form may include a hidden field with the record&#x27;s original content, a timestamp, a sequence number, or an opaque token. On submit, this is compared against the database. If it differs, the conflict resolution algorithm is invoked.

===Examples===
* MediaWiki&#x27;s edit pages use OCC.
* Bugzilla uses OCC; edit conflicts are called &quot;mid-air collisions&quot;.
* The Ruby on Rails framework has an API for OCC.
* The Grails framework uses OCC in its default conventions.
* The GT.M database engine uses OCC for managing transactions (even single updates are treated as mini-transactions).
* Microsoft&#x27;s Entity Framework (including Code-First) has built-in support for OCC based on a binary timestamp value.
* Most revision control systems support the &quot;merge&quot; model for concurrency, which is OCC.
* Mimer SQL is a DBMS that only implements optimistic concurrency control.
* Google App Engine data store uses OCC.
* The Apache Solr search engine supports OCC via the _version_ field.
* The Elasticsearch search engine updates its documents via OCC. Each version of a document is assigned a sequence number, and newer versions receive higher sequence numbers. As changes to a document arrive asynchronously, the software can use the sequence number to avoid overriding a newer version with an old one.
* CouchDB implements OCC through document revisions.
* The MonetDB column-oriented database management system&#x27;s transaction management scheme is based on OCC.
* Most implementations of software transactional memory use OCC.
* Redis provides OCC through WATCH command.
* Firebird uses Multi-generational architecture as an implementation of OCC for data management.
* DynamoDB uses conditional update as an implementation of OCC.
* Kubernetes uses OCC when updating resources.
* YugabyteDB is a cloud-native database that primarily uses OCC.
* Firestore is a NoSQL database by Firebase that uses OCC in its transactions.
* Apache Iceberg uses OCC to update tables and run maintenance operations on them.

<doc id="233013" wikidata="Q333625" url="?curid=233013" title="Absurdism">
<text>Absurdism is the philosophical theory that the universe is irrational and meaningless. It states that trying to find meaning leads people into conflict with a seemingly meaningless world. This conflict can be between rational man and an irrational universe, between intention and outcome, or between subjective assessment and objective worth, but the precise definition of the term is disputed. Absurdism claims that, due to one or more of these conflicts, existence &quot;as a whole&quot; is absurd. It differs in this regard from the less global thesis that some &quot;particular&quot; situations, persons, or phases in life are absurd.

Various components of the absurd are discussed in the academic literature, and different theorists frequently concentrate their definition and research on different components. On the practical level, the conflict underlying the absurd is characterized by the individual&#x27;s struggle to find meaning in a meaningless world. The theoretical component, on the other hand, emphasizes more the epistemic inability of reason to penetrate and understand reality. Traditionally, the conflict is characterized as a collision between an internal component, belonging to human nature, and an external component, belonging to the nature of the world. However, some later theorists have suggested that both components may be internal: the capacity to see through the arbitrariness of any ultimate purpose, on the one hand, and the incapacity to stop caring about such purposes, on the other hand. Certain accounts also involve a metacognitive component by holding that an awareness of the conflict is necessary for the absurd to arise.

Some arguments in favor of absurdism focus on the human insignificance in the universe, on the role of death, or on the implausibility or irrationality of positing an ultimate purpose. Objections to absurdism often contend that life is in fact meaningful or point out certain problematic consequences or inconsistencies of absurdism. Defenders of absurdism often complain that it does not receive the attention of professional philosophers it merits in virtue of the topic&#x27;s importance and its potential psychological impact on the affected individuals in the form of existential crises. Various possible responses to deal with absurdism and its impact have been suggested. The three responses discussed in the traditional absurdist literature are suicide, religious belief in a higher purpose, and rebellion against the absurd. Of these, rebellion is usually presented as the recommended response since, unlike the other two responses, it does not escape the absurd and instead recognizes it for what it is. Later theorists have suggested additional responses, like using irony to take life less seriously or remaining ignorant of the responsible conflict. Some absurdists argue that whether and how one responds is insignificant. This is based on the idea that if nothing really matters then the human response toward this fact does not matter either.

The term &quot;absurdism&quot; is most closely associated with the philosophy of Albert Camus. However, important precursors and discussions of the absurd are also found in the works of Søren Kierkegaard. Absurdism is intimately related to various other concepts and theories. Its basic outlook is inspired by existentialist philosophy. However, existentialism includes additional theoretical commitments and often takes a more optimistic attitude toward the possibility of finding or creating meaning in one&#x27;s life. Absurdism and nihilism share the belief that life is meaningless, but absurdists do not treat this as an isolated fact and are instead interested in the conflict between the human desire for meaning and the world&#x27;s lack thereof. Being confronted with this conflict may trigger an existential crisis, in which unpleasant experiences like anxiety or depression may push the affected to find a response for dealing with the conflict. Recognizing the absence of objective meaning, however, does not preclude the conscious thinker from finding subjective meaning in arbitrary places.

== Definition ==
Absurdism is the philosophical thesis that life, or the world in general, is absurd. There is wide agreement that the term &quot;absurd&quot; implies a lack of meaning or purpose but there is also significant dispute concerning its exact definition and various versions have been suggested. The choice of one&#x27;s definition has important implications for whether the thesis of absurdism is correct and for the arguments cited for and against it: it may be true on one definition and false on another.

In a general sense, the absurd is that which lacks a sense, often because it involves some form of contradiction. The absurd is paradoxical in the sense that it cannot be grasped by reason. But in the context of absurdism, the term is usually used in a more specific sense. According to most definitions, it involves a conflict, discrepancy, or collision between two things. Opinions differ on what these two things are. For example, it is traditionally identified as the confrontation of rational man with an irrational world or as the attempt to grasp something based on reasons even though it is beyond the limits of rationality. Similar definitions see the discrepancy between intention and outcome, between aspiration and reality, or between subjective assessment and objective worth as the source of absurdity. Other definitions locate both conflicting sides within man: the ability to apprehend the arbitrariness of final ends and the inability to let go of commitments to them. In regard to the conflict, absurdism differs from nihilism since it is not just the thesis that nothing matters. Instead, it includes the component that things seem to matter to us nonetheless and that this impression cannot be shaken off. This difference is expressed in the relational aspect of the absurd in that it constitutes a conflict between two sides.

Various components of the absurd have been suggested and different researchers often focus their definition and inquiry on one of these components. Some accounts emphasize the practical components concerned with the individual seeking meaning while others stress the theoretical components about being unable to know the world or to rationally grasp it. A different disagreement concerns whether the conflict exists only internal to the individual or is between the individual&#x27;s expectations and the external world. Some theorists also include the metacognitive component that the absurd entails that the individual is aware of this conflict.

An important aspect of absurdism is that the absurd is not limited to particular situations but encompasses life as a whole. There is a general agreement that people are often confronted with absurd situations in everyday life. They often arise when there is a serious mismatch between one&#x27;s intentions and reality. For example, a person struggling to break down a heavy front door is absurd if the house they are trying to break into lacks a back wall and could easily be entered on this route. But the philosophical thesis of absurdism is much more wide-reaching since it is not restricted to individual situations, persons, or phases in life. Instead, it asserts that life, or the world as a whole, is absurd. The claim that the absurd has such a global extension is controversial, in contrast to the weaker claim that some situations are absurd.

The perspective of absurdism usually comes into view when the agent takes a step back from their individual everyday engagements with the world to assess their importance from a bigger context. Such an assessment can result in the insight that the day-to-day engagements matter a lot to us despite the fact that they lack real meaning when evaluated from a wider perspective. This assessment reveals the conflict between the significance seen from the internal perspective and the arbitrariness revealed through the external perspective. The absurd becomes a problem since there is a strong desire for meaning and purpose even though they seem to be absent. In this sense, the conflict responsible for the absurd often either constitutes or is accompanied by an existential crisis.

== Components ==
=== Practical and theoretical ===
An important component of the absurd on the practical level concerns the seriousness people bring toward life. This seriousness is reflected in many different attitudes and areas, for example, concerning fame, pleasure, justice, knowledge, or survival, both in regard to ourselves as well as in regard to others. But there seems to be a discrepancy between how seriously we take our lives and the lives of others on the one hand, and how arbitrary they and the world at large seem to be on the other hand. This can be understood in terms of importance and caring: it is absurd that people continue to care about these matters even though they seem to lack importance on an objective level. The collision between these two sides can be defined as the absurd. This is perhaps best exemplified when the agent is seriously engaged in choosing between arbitrary options, none of which truly matters.

Some theorists characterize the ethical sides of absurdism and nihilism in the same way as the view that it does not matter how we act or that &quot;everything is permitted.&quot; On this view, an important aspect of the absurd is that whatever higher end or purpose we choose to pursue, it can also be put into doubt since, in the last step, it always lacks a higher-order justification. But usually, a distinction between absurdism and nihilism is made since absurdism involves the additional component that there is a conflict between man&#x27;s desire for meaning and the absence of meaning.

On a more theoretical view, absurdism is the belief that the world is, at its core, indifferent and impenetrable toward human attempts to uncover its deeper reason or that it cannot be known. According to this theoretical component, it involves the epistemological problem of the human limitations of knowing the world. This includes the thesis that the world is in critical ways ungraspable to humans, both in relation to what to believe and how to act. This is reflected in the chaos and irrationality of the universe, which acts according to its own laws in a manner indifferent to human concerns and aspirations. It is closely related to the idea that the world remains silent when we ask why things are the way they are. This silence arises from the impression that, on the most fundamental level, all things exist without a reason: they are simply there. An important aspect of these limitations to knowing the world is that they are essential to human cognition, i.e. they are not due to following false principles or accidental weaknesses but are inherent in the human cognitive faculties themselves.

Some theorists also link this problem to the circularity of human reason, which is very skilled at producing chains of justification linking one thing to another while trying and failing to do the same for the chain of justification as a whole when taking a reflective step backward. This implies that human reason is not just too limited to grasp life as a whole but that, if one seriously tried to do so anyway, its ungrounded circularity might collapse and lead to madness.

=== Internal and external ===
An important disagreement within the academic literature about the nature of absurdism and the absurd focuses specifically on whether the components responsible for the conflict are internal or external. According to the traditional position, the absurd has both internal and external components: it is due to the discrepancy between man&#x27;s internal desire to lead a meaningful life and the external meaninglessness of the world. In this view, humans have, among their desires, some transcendent aspirations that seek a higher form of meaning in life. The absurd arises since these aspirations are ignored by the world, which is indifferent to our &quot;need for validation of the importance of our concerns.&quot; This implies that the absurd &quot;is not in man ... nor in the world, but in their presence together. &quot; This position has been rejected by some later theorists, who hold that the absurd is purely internal because it &quot;derives not from a collision between our expectations and the world, but from a collision within ourselves&quot;.

The distinction is important since, on the latter view, the absurd is built into human nature and would prevail no matter what the world was like. So, it is not just that absurdism is true in the actual world. Instead, any possible world, even one that was designed by a divine god and guided by them according to their higher purpose, would still be equally absurd to man. In this sense, absurdity is the product of the power of our consciousness to take a step back from whatever it is considering and reflect on the reason of its object. When this process is applied to the world as a whole including God, it is bound to fail its search for a reason or an explanation, no matter what the world is like. In this sense, absurdity arises from the conflict between features of ourselves: &quot;our capacity to recognize the arbitrariness of our ultimate concerns and our simultaneous incapacity to relinquish our commitment to them&quot;. This view has the side-effect that the absurd depends on the fact that the affected person recognizes it. For example, people who fail to apprehend the arbitrariness or the conflict would not be affected.

=== Metacognitive ===
According to some researchers, a central aspect of the absurd is that the agent is aware of the existence of the corresponding conflict. This means that the person is conscious both of the seriousness they invest and of how it seems misplaced in an arbitrary world. It also implies that other entities that lack this form of consciousness, like non-organic matter or lower life forms, are not absurd and are not faced with this particular problem. Some theorists also emphasize that the conflict remains despite the individual&#x27;s awareness of it, i.e. that the individual continues to care about their everyday concerns despite their impression that, on the large scale, these concerns are meaningless. Defenders of the metacognitive component have argued that it manages to explain why absurdity is primarily ascribed to human aspirations but not to lower animals: because they lack this metacognitive awareness. However, other researchers reject the metacognitive requirement based on the fact that it would severely limit the scope of the absurd to only those possibly few individuals who clearly recognize the contradiction while sparing the rest. Thus, opponents have argued that not recognizing the conflict is just as absurd as consciously living through it.

== Arguments ==
=== For ===
Various popular arguments are often cited in favor of absurdism. Some focus on the future by pointing out that nothing we do today will matter in a million years. A similar line of argument points to the fact that our lives are insignificant because of how small they are in relation to the universe as a whole, both concerning their spatial and their temporal dimensions. The thesis of absurdism is also sometimes based on the problem of death, i.e. that there is no final end for us to pursue since we are all going to die. In this sense, death is said to destroy all our hard-earned achievements like career, wealth, or knowledge. This argument is mitigated to some extent by the fact that we may have positive or negative effects on the lives of other people as well. But this does not fully solve the issue since the same problem, i.e. the lack of an ultimate end, applies to their lives as well. Thomas Nagel has objected to these lines of argument based on the claim that they are circular: they assume rather than establish that life is absurd. For example, the claim that our actions today will not matter in a million years does not directly imply that they do not matter today. And similarly, the fact that a process does not reach a meaningful ultimate goal does not entail that the process as a whole is worthless since some parts of the process may contain their justification without depending on a justification external to them.

Another argument proceeds indirectly by pointing out how various great thinkers have obvious irrational elements in their systems of thought. These purported mistakes of reason are then taken as signs of absurdism that were meant to hide or avoid it. From this perspective, the tendency to posit the existence of a benevolent God may be seen as a form of defense mechanism or wishful thinking to avoid an unsettling and inconvenient truth. This is closely related to the idea that humans have an inborn desire for meaning and purpose, which is dwarfed by a meaningless and indifferent universe. For example, René Descartes aims to build a philosophical system based on the absolute certainty of the &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; just to introduce without a proper justification the existence of a benevolent and non-deceiving God in a later step in order to ensure that we can know about the external world. A similar problematic step is taken by John Locke, who accepts the existence of a God beyond sensory experience, despite his strict empiricism, which demands that all knowledge be based on sensory experience.

Other theorists argue in favor of absurdism based on the claim that meaning is relational. In this sense, for something to be meaningful, it has to stand in relation to something else that is meaningful. For example, a word is meaningful because of its relation to a language or someone&#x27;s life could be meaningful because this person dedicates their efforts to a higher meaningful project, like serving God or fighting poverty. An important consequence of this characterization of meaning is that it threatens to lead to an infinite regress: at each step, something is meaningful because something else is meaningful, which in its turn has meaning only because it is related to yet another meaningful thing, and so on. This infinite chain and the corresponding absurdity could be avoided if some things had intrinsic or ultimate meaning, i.e. if their meaning did not depend on the meaning of something else. For example, if things on the large scale, like God or fighting poverty, had meaning, then our everyday engagements could be meaningful by standing in the right relation to them. However, if these wider contexts themselves lack meaning then they are unable to act as sources of meaning for other things. This would lead to the absurd when understood as the conflict between the impression that our everyday engagements are meaningful even though they lack meaning because they do not stand in a relation to something else that is meaningful.

Another argument for absurdism is based on the attempt of assessing standards of what matters and why it matters. It has been argued that the only way to answer such a question is in reference to these standards themselves. This means that, in the end, it depends only on us, that &quot;what seems to us important or serious or valuable would not seem so if we were differently constituted&quot;. The circularity and groundlessness of these standards themselves are then used to argue for absurdism.

=== Against ===
The most common criticism of absurdism is to argue that life in fact has meaning. Supernaturalist arguments to this effect are based on the claim that God exists and acts as the source of meaning. Naturalist arguments, on the other hand, contend that various sources of meaning can be found in the natural world without recourse to a supernatural realm. Some of them hold that meaning is subjective. On this view, whether a given thing is meaningful varies from person to person based on their subjective attitude toward this thing. Others find meaning in external values, for example, in morality, knowledge, or beauty. All these different positions have in common that they affirm the existence of meaning, in contrast to absurdism.

Another criticism of absurdism focuses on its negative attitude toward moral values. In the absurdist literature, the moral dimension is sometimes outright denied, for example, by holding that value judgments are to be discarded or that the rejection of God implies the rejection of moral values. On this view, absurdism brings with it a highly controversial form of moral nihilism. This means that there is a lack, not just of a higher purpose in life, but also of moral values. These two sides can be linked by the idea that without a higher purpose, nothing is worth pursuing that could give one&#x27;s life meaning. This worthlessness seems to apply to morally relevant actions equally as to other issues. In this sense, &quot;[b]elief in the meaning of life always implies a scale of values&quot; while &quot;[b]elief in the absurd ... teaches the contrary&quot;. Various objections to such a position have been presented, for example, that it violates common sense or that it leads to numerous radical consequences, like that no one is ever guilty of any blameworthy behavior or that there are no ethical rules.

But this negative attitude toward moral values is not always consistently maintained by absurdists and some of the suggested responses on how to deal with the absurd seem to explicitly defend the existence of moral values. Due to this ambiguity, other critics of absurdism have objected to it based on its inconsistency. The moral values defended by absurdists often overlap with the ethical outlook of existentialism and include traits like sincerity, authenticity, and courage as virtues. In this sense, absurdists often argue that it matters how the agent faces the absurdity of their situation and that the response should exemplify these virtues. This aspect is particularly prominent in the idea that the agent should rebel against the absurd and live their life authentically as a form of passionate revolt.

Some see the latter position as inconsistent with the idea that there is no meaning in life: if nothing matters then it should also not matter how we respond to this fact. So absurdists seem to be committed both to the claim that moral values exist and that they do not exist. Defenders of absurdism have tried to resist this line of argument by contending that, in contrast to other responses, it remains true to the basic insight of absurdism and the &quot;logic of the absurd&quot; by acknowledging the existence of the absurd instead of denying it. But this defense is not always accepted. One of its shortcomings seems to be that it commits the is-ought fallacy: absurdism presents itself as a descriptive claim about the existence and nature of the absurd but then goes on to posit various normative claims. Another defense of absurdism consists in weakening the claims about how one should respond to the absurd and which virtues such a response should exemplify. On this view, absurdism may be understood as a form of self-help that merely provides prudential advice. Such prudential advice may be helpful to certain people without pretending to have the status of universally valid moral values or categorical normative judgments. So the value of the prudential advice may merely be relative to the interests of some people but not valuable in a more general sense. This way, absurdists have tried to resolve the apparent inconsistency in their position.

== Examples ==
According to absurdism, life in general is absurd: the absurd is not just limited to a few specific cases. Nonetheless, some cases are more paradigmatic examples than others. &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; is often treated as a key example of the absurd. In it, Zeus punishes King Sisyphus by compelling him to roll a massive boulder up a hill. Whenever the boulder reaches the top, it rolls down again, thereby forcing Sisyphus to repeat the same task all over again throughout eternity. This story may be seen as an absurdist parable for the hopelessness and futility of human life in general: just like Sisyphus, humans in general are condemned to toil day in and day out in the attempt to fulfill pointless tasks, which will be replaced by new pointless tasks once they are completed. It has been argued that a central aspect of Sisyphus&#x27; situation is not just the futility of his labor but also his awareness of the futility.

Another example of the absurdist aspect of the human condition is given in Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot;. In it, the protagonist Josef K. is arrested and prosecuted by an inaccessible authority even though he is convinced that he has done nothing wrong. Throughout the story, he desperately tries to discover what crimes he is accused of and how to defend himself. But in the end, he lets go of his futile attempts and submits to his execution without ever finding out what he was accused of. The absurd nature of the world is exemplified by the mysterious and impenetrable functioning of the judicial system, which seems indifferent to Josef K. and resists all of his attempts of making sense of it.

== Importance ==
Philosophers of absurdism often complain that the topic of the absurd does not receive the attention of professional philosophers it merits, especially when compared to other perennial philosophical areas of inquiry. It has been argued, for example, that this can be seen in the tendency of various philosophers throughout the ages to include the epistemically dubitable existence of God in their philosophical systems as a source of ultimate explanation of the mysteries of existence. In that regard, this tendency may be seen as a form of defense mechanism or wishful thinking constituting a side-effect of the unacknowledged and ignored importance of the absurd. While some discussions of absurdism happen explicitly in the philosophical literature, it is often presented in a less explicit manner in the form of novels or plays. These presentations usually happen by telling stories that exemplify some of the key aspects of absurdism even though they may not explicitly discuss the topic.

It has been argued that acknowledging the existence of the absurd has important consequences for epistemology, especially in relation to philosophy but also when applied more widely to other fields. The reason for this is that acknowledging the absurd includes becoming aware of human cognitive limitations and may lead to a form of epistemic humbleness.

The impression that life is absurd may in some cases have serious psychological consequences like triggering an existential crisis. In this regard, an awareness both of absurdism itself and the possible responses to it can be central to avoiding or resolving such consequences.

== Possible responses ==

Most researchers argue that the basic conflict posed by the absurd cannot be truly resolved. This means that any attempt to do so is bound to fail even though their protagonists may not be aware of their failure. On this view, there are still several possible responses, some better than others, but none able to solve the fundamental conflict. Traditional absurdism, as exemplified by Albert Camus, holds that there are three possible responses to absurdism: suicide, religious belief, or revolting against the absurd. Later researchers have suggested more ways of responding to absurdism.

A very blunt and simple response, though quite radical, is to commit suicide. According to Camus, for example, the problem of suicide is the only &quot;really serious philosophical problem&quot;. It consists in seeking an answer to the question &quot;Should I kill myself?&quot;. This response is motivated by the insight that, no matter how hard the agent tries, they may never reach their goal of leading a meaningful life, which can then justify the rejection of continuing to live at all. Most researchers acknowledge that this is one form of response to the absurd but reject it due to its radical and irreversible nature and argue instead for a different approach.

One such alternative response to the apparent absurdity of life is to assume that there is some higher ultimate purpose in which the individual may participate, like service to society, progress of history, or God&#x27;s glory. While the individual may only play a small part in the realization of this overarching purpose, it may still act as a source of meaning. This way, the individual may find meaning and thereby escape the absurd. One serious issue with this approach is that the problem of absurdity applies to this alleged higher purpose as well. So just like the aims of a single individual life can be put into doubt, this applies equally to a larger purpose shared by many. And if this purpose is itself absurd, it fails to act as a source of meaning for the individual participating in it. Camus identifies this response as a form of suicide as well, pertaining not to the physical but to the philosophical level. It is a philosophical suicide in the sense that the individual just assumes that the chosen higher purpose is meaningful and thereby fails to reflect on its absurdity.

Traditional absurdists usually reject both physical and philosophical suicide as the recommended response to the absurd, usually with the argument that both these responses constitute some form of escape that fails to face the absurd for what it is. Despite the gravity and inevitability of the absurd, they recommend that we should face it directly, i.e. not escape from it by retreating into the illusion of false hope or by ending one&#x27;s life. In this sense, accepting the reality of the absurd means rejecting any hopes for a happy afterlife free of those contradictions. Instead, the individual should acknowledge the absurd and engage in a rebellion against it. Such a revolt usually exemplifies certain virtues closely related to existentialism, like the affirmation of one&#x27;s freedom in the face of adversity as well as accepting responsibility and defining one&#x27;s own essence. An important aspect of this lifestyle is that life is lived passionately and intensely by inviting and seeking new experiences. Such a lifestyle might be exemplified by an actor, a conqueror, or a seduction artist who is constantly on the lookout for new roles, conquests, or attractive people despite their awareness of the absurdity of these enterprises. Another aspect lies in creativity, i.e. that the agent sees themselves as and acts as the creator of their own works and paths in life. This constitutes a form of rebellion in the sense that the agent remains aware of the absurdity of the world and their part in it but keeps on opposing it instead of resigning and admitting defeat. But this response does not solve the problem of the absurd at its core: even a life dedicated to the rebellion against the absurd is itself still absurd. Defenders of the rebellious response to absurdism have pointed out that, despite its possible shortcomings, it has one important advantage over many of its alternatives: it manages to accept the absurd for what it is without denying it by rejecting that it exists or by stopping one&#x27;s own existence. Some even hold that it is the only philosophically coherent response to the absurd.

While these three responses are the most prominent ones in the traditional absurdist literature, various other responses have also been suggested. Instead of rebellion, for example, absurdism may also lead to a form of irony. This irony is not sufficient to escape the absurdity of life altogether, but it may mitigate it to some extent by distancing oneself to some degree from the seriousness of life. According to Thomas Nagel, there may be, at least theoretically, two responses to actually resolving the problem of the absurd. This is based on the idea that the absurd arises from the consciousness of a conflict between two aspects of human life: that humans care about various things and that the world seems arbitrary and does not merit this concern. The absurd would not arise if either of the conflicting elements would cease to exist, i.e. if the individual would stop caring about things, as some Eastern religions seem to suggest, or if one could find something that possesses a non-arbitrary meaning that merits the concern. For theorists who give importance to the consciousness of this conflict for the absurd, a further option presents itself: to remain ignorant of it to the extent that this is possible.

Other theorists hold that a proper response to the absurd may neither be possible nor necessary, that it just remains one of the basic aspects of life no matter how it is confronted. This lack of response may be justified through the thesis of absurdism itself: if nothing really matters on the grand scale, then this applies equally to human responses toward this fact. From this perspective, the passionate rebellion against an apparently trivial or unimportant state of affairs seems less like a heroic quest and more like a fool&#x27;s errand. Jeffrey Gordon has objected to this criticism based on the claim that there is a difference between absurdity and lack of importance. So even if life as a whole is absurd, some facts about life may still be more important than others and the fact that life as a whole is absurd would be a good candidate for the more important facts.

== History ==
Absurdism has its origins in the work of the 19th-century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, who chose to confront the crisis that humans face with the Absurd by developing his own existentialist philosophy. Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought and published his essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;. The aftermath of World War II provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of France. Foucault viewed Shakespearean theater as a precursor of absurdism.

=== Immanuel Kant ===
An idea very close to the concept of the absurd is due to Immanuel Kant, who distinguishes between phenomena and noumena. This distinction refers to the gap between how things appear to us and what they are like in themselves. For example, according to Kant, space and times are dimensions belonging to the realm of phenomena since this is how sensory impressions are organized by the mind, but may not be found on the level of noumena. The concept of the absurd corresponds to the thesis that there is such a gap and human limitations may limit the mind from ever truly grasping reality, i.e. that reality in this sense remains absurd to the mind.

=== Søren Kierkegaard ===
A century before Camus, the 19th-century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard wrote extensively about the absurdity of the world. In his journals, Kierkegaard writes about the absurd:

Here is another example of the Absurd from his writings: 

How can this absurdity be held or believed? Kierkegaard says: 

Kierkegaard provides an example in &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; (1843), which was published under the pseudonym &quot;Johannes de Silentio&quot;. In the story of Abraham in the Book of Genesis, Abraham is told by God to kill his son Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac, an angel stops Abraham from doing so. Kierkegaard believes that through virtue of the absurd, Abraham, defying all reason and ethical duties (&quot;you cannot act&quot;), got back his son and reaffirmed his faith (&quot;where I have to act&quot;).

Another instance of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard&#x27;s work appears in &quot;The Sickness Unto Death&quot;, which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym &quot;Anti-Climacus&quot;. Exploring the forms of despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance. In the opening quotation reproduced at the beginning of the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.

According to Kierkegaard in his autobiography &quot;The Point of View of My Work as an Author&quot;, most of his pseudonymous writings are not necessarily reflective of his own opinions. Nevertheless, his work anticipated many absurdist themes and provided its theoretical background.

=== Albert Camus ===
The philosophy of Albert Camus, or more precisely the “camusian absurd” (French : &quot;l&#x27;absurde camusien&quot;), refers with absurdism to the work and philosophical thought of the French writer Albert Camus. This philosophy is influenced by the author&#x27;s political, libertarian, social and ecological ideas; and is inspired by previous philosophical trends, such as Greek philosophy, nihilism, the Nietzschean thought or existentialism. It revolves around three major cycles: “the absurd (&quot;l&#x27;absurde&quot;)”, “the revolt (&quot;la révolte&quot;)” and “love (&quot;l&#x27;amour&quot;)”. Each cycle is linked to a Greek myth (Sisyphus, Prometheus, Nemesis) and explores specific themes and objects; the common thread remaining the solitude and despair of the human, constantly driven by the tireless search for the meaning of the world and of life.The cycle of the absurd, or &quot;negation&quot;, primarily addresses suicide and the human condition. It is expressed through four of Camus&#x27;s works: the novel &quot;The Stranger&quot; and the essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; (1942), then the plays &quot;Caligula&quot; and &quot;The Misunderstanding&quot; (1944). By refusing the refuge of belief, Human becomes aware that his existence revolves around repetitive and meaningless acts. The certainty of death only reinforces, according to the writer, the feeling of uselessness of all existence. The absurd is therefore the feeling that man feels when confronted with the absence of meaning in the face of the Universe, the painful realization of his separation from the world. The question then arises of the legitimacy of suicide.

The cycle of revolt, called &quot;the positive&quot;, is a direct response to the absurd and is also expressed by four of his works: the novel &quot;The Plague&quot; (1947), the plays &quot;The State of Siege&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Just Assassins&quot; (1949), then the essay &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1951). Positive concept of affirmation of the individual, where only action and commitment count in the face of the tragedy of the world, revolt is for the writer the way of experiencing the absurd, knowing our fatal destiny and nevertheless facing it : “Man refuses the world as it is, without agreeing to escape it.” It is intelligence grappling with the “unreasonable silence of the world”. Depriving ourselves of eternal life frees us from the constraints imposed by an improbable future; Man gains freedom of action, lucidity and dignity.

The philosophy of Camus therefore has as its finitude a singular humanism. Advancing a message of lucidity, resilience and emancipation in the face of the absurdity of life, it encourages people to create their own meanings through personal choices and commitments, and to embrace their freedom to the fullest. Because he affirms that, even in the absurd, there is room for passion and rebellion; and although the Universe may be indifferent to our search for meaning, this search is &quot;in itself&quot; meaningful. In &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, despite his absurd destiny, Sisyphus finds a form of liberation in his incessant work: “one must imagine Sisyphus happy”. With the cycle of love and the “midday thought” (French: &quot;la pensée de midi&quot;), the philosophy of the absurd is completed by a principle of measurement and pleasure, close to Epicureanism.

Though the notion of the &#x27;absurd&#x27; pervades all Albert Camus&#x27;s writing, &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; is his chief work on the subject. In it, Camus considers absurdity as a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict or a &quot;divorce&quot; between two ideals. Specifically, he defines the human condition as absurd, as the confrontation between man&#x27;s desire for significance, meaning and clarity on the one hand—and the silent, cold universe on the other. He continues that there are specific human experiences evoking notions of absurdity. Such a realization or encounter with the absurd leaves the individual with a choice: suicide, a leap of faith, or recognition. He concludes that recognition is the only defensible option.

For Camus, suicide is a &quot;confession&quot; that life is not worth living; it is a choice that implicitly declares that life is &quot;too much.&quot; Suicide offers the most basic &quot;way out&quot; of absurdity: the immediate termination of the self and its place in the universe.

The absurd encounter can also arouse a &quot;leap of faith,&quot; a term derived from one of Kierkegaard&#x27;s early pseudonyms, &quot;Johannes de Silentio&quot; (although the term was not used by Kierkegaard himself), where one believes that there is more than the rational life (aesthetic or ethical). To take a &quot;leap of faith,&quot; one must act with the &quot;virtue of the absurd&quot; (as &quot;Johannes de Silentio&quot; put it), where a suspension of the ethical may need to exist. This faith has no expectations, but is a flexible power initiated by a recognition of the absurd. Camus states that because the leap of faith escapes rationality and defers to abstraction over personal experience, the leap of faith is not absurd. Camus considers the leap of faith as &quot;philosophical suicide,&quot; rejecting both this and physical suicide.

Lastly, a person can choose to embrace the absurd condition. According to Camus, one&#x27;s freedom—and the opportunity to give life meaning—lies in the recognition of absurdity. If the absurd experience is truly the realization that the universe is fundamentally devoid of absolutes, then we as individuals are truly free. &quot;To live without appeal,&quot; as he puts it, is a philosophical move to define absolutes and universals subjectively, rather than objectively. The freedom of man is thus established in one&#x27;s natural ability and opportunity to create their own meaning and purpose; to decide (or think) for oneself. The individual becomes the most precious unit of existence, representing a set of unique ideals that can be characterized as an entire universe in its own right. In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone. &quot;Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable.&quot;

Camus states in &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;: &quot;Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide.&quot; &quot;Revolt&quot; here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; &quot;Freedom&quot; refers to the lack of imprisonment by religious devotion or others&#x27; moral codes; &quot;Passion&quot; refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully.

== Relation to other concepts ==
=== Existentialism and nihilism ===
Absurdism originated from (as well as alongside) the 20th-century strains of existentialism and nihilism; it shares some prominent starting points with both, though also entails conclusions that are uniquely distinct from these other schools of thought. All three arose from the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from existence: the apparent meaninglessness of a world in which humans, nevertheless, are compelled to find or create meaning. The three schools of thought diverge from there. Existentialists have generally advocated the individual&#x27;s construction of their own meaning in life as well as the free will of the individual. Nihilists, on the contrary, contend that &quot;it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found.&quot; Absurdists, following Camus&#x27; formulation, hesitantly allow the possibility for some meaning or value in life, but are neither as certain as existentialists are about the value of one&#x27;s own constructed meaning nor as nihilists are about the total inability to create meaning. Absurdists following Camus also devalue or outright reject free will, encouraging merely that the individual live defiantly and authentically &quot;in spite of&quot; the psychological tension of the Absurd.

Camus himself passionately worked to counter nihilism, as he explained in his essay &quot;The Rebel&quot;, while he also categorically rejected the label of &quot;existentialist&quot; in his essay &quot;Enigma&quot; and in the compilation &quot;The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus&quot;, though he was, and still is, often broadly characterized by others as an existentialist. Both existentialism and absurdism entail consideration of the practical applications of becoming conscious of the truth of existential nihilism: i.e., how a driven seeker of meaning should act when suddenly confronted with the seeming concealment, or downright absence, of meaning in the universe.

While absurdism can be seen as a kind of response to existentialism, it can be debated exactly how substantively the two positions differ from each other. The existentialist, after all, does not deny the reality of death. But the absurdist seems to reaffirm the way in which death ultimately nullifies our meaning-making activities, a conclusion the existentialists seem to resist through various notions of posterity or, in Sartre&#x27;s case, participation in a grand humanist project.

=== Existential crisis ===
The basic problem of absurdism is usually not encountered through a dispassionate philosophical inquiry but as the manifestation of an existential crisis. Existential crises are inner conflicts in which the individual wrestles with the impression that life lacks meaning. They are accompanied by various negative experiences, such as stress, anxiety, despair, and depression, which can disturb the individual&#x27;s normal functioning in everyday life. In this sense, the conflict underlying the absurdist perspective poses a psychological challenge to the affected. This challenge is due to the impression that the agent&#x27;s vigorous daily engagement stands in incongruity with its apparent insignificance encountered through philosophical reflection. Realizing this incongruity is usually not a pleasant occurrence and may lead to estrangement, alienation, and hopelessness. The intimate relation to psychological crises is also manifested in the problem of finding the right response to this unwelcome conflict, for example, by denying it, by taking life less seriously, or by revolting against the absurd. But accepting the position of absurdism may also have certain positive psychological effects. In this sense, it can help the individual achieve a certain psychological distance from unexamined dogmas and thus help them evaluate their situation from a more encompassing and objective perspective. However, it brings with it the danger of leveling all significant differences and thereby making it difficult for the individual to decide what to do or how to live their life.

=== Epistemological skepticism ===
It has been argued that absurdism in the practical domain resembles epistemological skepticism in the theoretical domain. In the case of epistemology, we usually take for granted our knowledge of the world around us even though, when methodological doubt is applied, it turns out that this knowledge is not as unshakable as initially assumed. For example, the agent may decide to trust their perception that the sun is shining but its reliability depends on the assumption that the agent is not dreaming, which they would not know even if they were dreaming. In a similar sense in the practical domain, the agent may decide to take aspirin in order to avoid a headache even though they may be unable to give a reason for why they should be concerned with their own wellbeing at all. In both cases, the agent goes ahead with a form of unsupported natural confidence and takes life largely for granted despite the fact that their power to justify is only limited to a rather small range and fails when applied to the larger context, on which the small range depends.

=== Education ===
It has been argued that absurdism is opposed to various fundamental principles and assumptions guiding education, like the importance of truth and of fostering rationality in the students.

<doc id="233017" wikidata="Q130985" url="?curid=233017" title="Pin grid array">
<text>A pin grid array (PGA) is a type of integrated circuit packaging. In a PGA, the package is square or rectangular, and the pins are arranged in a regular array on the underside of the package. The pins are commonly spaced 2.54 mm (0.1&quot;) apart, and may or may not cover the entire underside of the package.

PGAs are often mounted on printed circuit boards using the through hole method or inserted into a socket. PGAs allow for more pins per integrated circuit than older packages, such as dual in-line package (DIP).

== Chip mounting ==

The chip can be mounted either on the top or the bottom (the pinned side). Connections can be made either by wire bonding or through flip chip mounting. Typically, PGA packages use wire bonding when the chip is mounted on the pinned side, and flip chip construction when the chip is on the top side. Some PGA packages contain multiple dies, for example Zen 2 and Zen 3 Ryzen CPUs for the AM4 socket.

=== Flip chip ===
A flip-chip pin grid array (FC-PGA or FCPGA) is a form of pin grid array in which the die faces downwards on the top of the substrate with the back of the die exposed. This allows the die to have a more direct contact with the heatsink or other cooling mechanism.

FC-PGA CPUs were introduced by Intel in 1999, for Coppermine core Pentium III and Celeron processors based on Socket 370, and were produced until Socket G3 in 2013. FC-PGA processors fit into zero insertion force (ZIF) motherboard sockets; similar packages were also used by AMD.

== Material ==

=== Ceramic ===
A ceramic pin grid array (CPGA) is a type of packaging used by integrated circuits. This type of packaging uses a ceramic substrate with pins arranged in a pin grid array. Some CPUs that use CPGA packaging are the AMD Socket A Athlons and the Duron.

A CPGA was used by AMD for Athlon and Duron processors based on Socket A, as well as some AMD processors based on Socket AM2 and Socket AM2+. While similar form factors have been used by other manufacturers, they are not officially referred to as CPGA. This type of packaging uses a ceramic substrate with pins arranged in an array.

=== Organic ===

An organic pin grid array (OPGA) is a type of connection for integrated circuits, and especially CPUs, where the silicon die is attached to a plate made out of an organic plastic which is pierced by an array of pins which make the requisite connections to the socket.

=== Plastic ===
Plastic pin grid array (PPGA) packaging was used by Intel for late-model Mendocino core Celeron processors based on Socket 370. Some pre-Socket 8 processors also used a similar form factor, although they were not officially referred to as PPGA.
== Pin layout ==

=== Staggered pin ===
The staggered pin grid array (SPGA) is used by Intel processors based on Socket 5 and Socket 7. Socket 8 used a partial SPGA layout on half the processor.


It consists of two square arrays of pins, offset in both directions by half the minimum distance between pins in one of the arrays. Put differently: within a square boundary the pins form a diagonal square lattice. There is generally a section in the center of the package without any pins. SPGA packages are usually used by devices that require a higher pin density than what a PGA can provide, such as microprocessors.

=== Stud ===
A stud grid array (SGA) is a short-pinned pin grid array chip scale package for use in surface-mount technology. The polymer stud grid array or plastic stud grid array was developed jointly by the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC) and Laboratory for Production Technology, Siemens AG.

=== rPGA ===
The reduced pin grid array was used by the socketed mobile variants of Intel&#x27;s Core i3/5/7 processors and features a reduced pin pitch of 1mm, as opposed to the 1.27mm pin pitch used by contemporary AMD processors and older Intel processors. It is used in the G1, G2, and G3 sockets.

<text>The zig-zag in-line package (ZIP) is a packaging technology for integrated circuits. It was intended as a replacement for dual in-line packaging (DIL or DIP). A ZIP is an integrated circuit encapsulated in a slab of plastic with 16, 20, 28 or 40 pins, measuring (for the ZIP-20 package) about 3 mm x 30 mm x 10 mm. The package&#x27;s pins protrude in two rows from one of the long edges. The two rows are staggered by 1.27 mm (0.05&quot;), giving them a zig-zag appearance, and allowing them to be spaced more closely than a rectangular grid would allow. The pins are inserted into holes in a printed circuit board, with the packages standing at right-angles to the board, allowing them to be placed closer together than DIPs of the same size. ZIPs have now been superseded by surface-mount packages such as the thin small-outline packages (TSOPs), but are still in use. The quad in-line package uses a similar staggered semiconductor package design, but on two sides instead of one.

High-power devices (such as high-voltage op-amp ICs, voltage regulators, and motor driver ICs) are still being manufactured in a package with a zig-zag pinout (and normally screwed onto a heatsink). These zig-zag packages include variations on the TO220 such as &quot;TO220S&quot;, &quot;staggered leads TO-220-11&quot;, &quot;staggered leads TO-220-15&quot;, and HZIP. The trademarks Pentawatt or Hexawatt are also used for chips in multi-leaded power packages like TDA2002/2003/2020/2030 and L200.

As for computers, dynamic RAM ZIP chips are now only to be found in obsolete computers, some of these are:
* Amiga 500 expansion packs
* Amiga 3000 on-board memory and some expansion boards
* Commodore CDTV on-board memory
* Acorn Archimedes 300 and 400 series on-board memory
* Acorn Archimedes A3010 and A3020

<doc id="233022" wikidata="Q319302" url="?curid=233022" title="Jean-Baptiste Kléber">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Kléber (; 9 March 1753 – 14 June 1800) was a French army officer who served in the War of the Bavarian Succession and the French Revolutionary Wars. After serving for one year in the French Royal Army, he joined the army of the Holy Roman Empire seven years later. However, his humble birth hindered his opportunities. Eventually, Kléber joined the French Revolutionary Army in 1792 and quickly rose through the ranks.

Serving in the Rhineland during the War of the First Coalition, he also suppressed the Vendée Revolt. Kléber retired to private life in the peaceful interim after the Treaty of Campo Formio, but returned to military service to accompany Napoleon in the French invasion of Egypt in 1798. As the invasion started to suffer setbacks, Napoleon returned to Paris in 1799 and appointed Kléber as commander of all French forces in Egypt. He was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a Syrian theology student, in Cairo in 1800.

A trained architect, Kléber, in times of peace, designed a number of buildings.

== Early career ==
Jean-Baptiste Kléber was born on 9 March 1753 in Strasbourg, in the province of Alsace, where his father worked as a master builder. He briefly engaged in 1769 in the French 1st Hussar Regiment, but resigned to study, from 1770 to 1774, architecture, partly in Paris with Jean Chalgrin. His opportune assistance to two German nobles in a tavern brawl obtained for him nomination to the military school of Munich. From this education, he obtained a commission in the &quot;Kaunitz&quot; Infantry Regiment Nr. 38 of the Habsburg Austrian army. He took part in the War of the Bavarian Succession but did not see major engagements. He was stationed alternately in the garrisons of Mons, Mechelen, and Luxembourg in the Austrian Netherlands. Finding that his humble birth hindered his chances for promotion beyond that of an unterleutnant, he left the Austrian army in 1783 after serving seven years.

=== Architecture ===

On returning to France, Kléber received the appointment of inspector of public buildings at Belfort. Between 1784 and 1792, he designed a number of buildings both on public and private commission. Perhaps the most notable is the Hôtel de Ville at Thann, Haut-Rhin (1787–1793), which was originally designed as a hospital but turned into an administrative building before its completion. Other surviving buildings are the &quot;château&quot; of Grandvillars (often erroneously spelled &quot;Granvillars&quot;), built around 1790 and the canoness houses of the Benedictine abbey of Masevaux (1781–1790). Nine of these houses had been planned but due to the French Revolution, only seven were built. The Musée historique de Strasbourg features a room dedicated to Jean-Baptiste Kléber that also displays a number of his sketches and architectural designs.

== French Revolutionary Wars ==
In 1792, at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, Kléber enlisted in the 4th Battalion of Volunteers of Haut-Rhin. Thanks to his military experience, he was at once elected adjutant and soon afterward lieutenant-colonel of the battalion. At the defense of Mainz in July 1793 he so distinguished himself that, though disgraced along with the rest of the garrison and imprisoned, he promptly won reinstatement, and was promoted to brigade general in August 1793.

Kléber was then posted to the Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle and deployed to Western France, where he took part in the suppression of the Revolt in the Vendée. Although beaten at the Battle of Tiffauges on 19 September 1793, he maintained good relations with the representatives on mission and managed to keep his command. A month later, Kléber contributed to the Republican victory at Cholet, earning him his promotion to general of division on 17 October 1793. In these operations began his intimacy with General François Marceau, with whom he defeated the Royalists at the battles of Le Mans and Savenay in December 1793.

When Kléber openly expressed his opinion that the Vendéans merited lenient measures, the authorities recalled him, but reinstated him once more in April 1794 and sent him to the Army of the Ardennes. He displayed his skill and bravery in the numerous actions around Charleroi, and especially in the crowning victory at Fleurus (26 June 1794). During the following years he served mostly in the Army of Sambre and Meuse on the Rhine frontier. In the winter of 1794–1795 he besieged Mainz. In 1795, and again in 1796, Kléber held the chief command of the army temporarily, but declined a permanent appointment as commander-in-chief.

On 13 October 1795 he fought a brilliant rearguard action at the bridge of Neuwied, and in the offensive campaign of 1796, he served as General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan&#x27;s most active and successful lieutenant, with his victory at Siegburg on 1 June that year enabling Jourdan to get the bulk of the French force across the Rhine. After the retreat to the Rhine, Kléber again declined a chief command, and retired into private life in early 1798. He returned to service later that year, first in the Army of England, then accepted a division in the Army of the Orient under General Napoleon Bonaparte.

=== Egyptian campaign ===
Kléber followed Bonaparte in his expedition to Egypt but suffered a wound in the head in the first engagement at Alexandria, which prevented him for taking part in the Battle of the Pyramids, and caused his appointment as governor of Alexandria. In the Syrian campaign of 1799, however, he commanded the vanguard, took El-Arish, Gaza, and Jaffa, and won a great victory at the Battle of Mount Tabor on 15–16 April 1799.

The campaign was not going well for the French as Napoleon withdrew and returned to France towards the end of 1799. Napoleon left Kléber in command of the French forces, without consulting Kléber before leaving. In this capacity, seeing no hope of bringing his army back to France or of consolidating his conquests, he negotiated the Convention of El-Arish (24 January 1800) with Commodore Sidney Smith, winning the right to an honorable evacuation of the French army. When Admiral Lord Keith refused to ratify the terms, Kléber attacked the Turks at the Battle of Heliopolis. Although he had only 10,000 men against 60,000 Turks, Kléber&#x27;s forces utterly defeated the Turks on 20 March 1800. He then re-took Cairo, which had revolted against French rule.

Kléber, son of an operative mason and a prominent freemason himself, was attestedly instrumental in bringing freemasonry to Egypt. While he was negotiating with Sidney Smith in January 1800, Kléber opened a masonic temple in Cairo and thus created the Isis lodge (&quot;La Loge Isis&quot;), serving as its first master. The motto of the lodge was the slogan of the French Revolution: &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot;.

=== Assassination ===
Shortly after these victories, while Kléber was walking in the garden of the palace of Alfi bika, he was stabbed to death by Suleiman al-Halabi, a Kurdish or Arab Syrian student living in Egypt. The assassin appeared to be begging from Kléber, but then took his hand and stabbed him in the heart, stomach, left arm, and right cheek, before running away to hide near the palace. He was soon caught, still in possession of the dagger which he had used to kill Kléber, and was later executed. The assassination happened in Cairo on 14 June 1800, coincidentally the same day on which Kléber&#x27;s friend and comrade, Desaix, fell at Marengo. The assassin&#x27;s right arm was burned off, and he was impaled in a public square in Cairo and left for several hours to die. Suleiman&#x27;s skull was shipped to France and used to teach medical students what the French phrenologists claimed were the cranial features indicating &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;fanaticism&quot;

=== Burial ===
After his assassination, Kléber&#x27;s embalmed body was repatriated to France. Fearing that his tomb would become a symbol of Republicanism, Napoleon ordered it held at the Château d&#x27;If, on an island near Marseille. It stayed there for 18 years until Louis XVIII granted Kléber a burial place in his home town of Strasbourg. He was buried on 15 December 1838 below his statue located in the center of Place Kléber. His heart is in an urn in the &quot;caveau&quot; of the Governors beneath the altar of the Saint Louis Chapel in Les Invalides, Paris. Kléber&#x27;s name is inscribed in column 23 on the southern pillar of the Arc de Triomphe.

== Assessment ==
Kléber emerged as undoubtedly one of the greatest generals of the French revolutionary epoch. Though he distrusted his powers and declined the responsibility of supreme command, there is nothing in his career to show that he would have been unequal to it. As a second-in-command no general of his time excelled him. His conduct of affairs in Egypt, at a time when the treasury was empty and the troops were discontented for want of pay, shows that his powers as an administrator were little, if at all, inferior to those he possessed as a general. While Kléber himself had a mixed view of Napoleon (including cursing at him and drawing mocking caricatures of him), Bonaparte thought highly of Kléber&#x27;s skill, stating that there was, &quot;No sight so splendid as watching Kléber go into battle&quot;, and he likened him to the God of War Mars.

<text>FC Energie Cottbus (Lower Sorbian: &quot;Energija Chóśebuz&quot;) is a German football club based in Cottbus, Brandenburg. It was founded in 1963 as SC Cottbus in what was East Germany. After the reunification of Germany, Energie played six seasons in the third tier of the German football league system before floating between the 2. Bundesliga and Bundesliga for 17 years between 1997 and 2014. From 2014 to 2016, the club played in the third tier, 3. Liga, and were then relegated to the Regionalliga Nordost. In 2018, they were promoted back into the 3. Liga, only to be relegated again the next season.

==History==
===Predecessor sides===
Energie Cottbus can trace its roots back to a predecessor side of FSV Glückauf Brieske-Senftenberg, a club founded by coal miners in 1919, in what was then called the town of Marga. FV Grube Marga, as the club was then called, was active until 1924 when the miners left to form a new team called SV Sturm Grube Marga, which was banned by the Nazi Party in 1933.

===East German era===

The club re-emerged after World War II in 1949 as BSG Franz Mehring Grube, becoming BSG Aktivist Brieske-Ost in 1950. The club was re-organized as sports club SC Aktivist Brieske-Senftenberg in 1954 and played in the DDR-Oberliga generally earning mid-table results until relegation to second-tier DDR-Liga in the early 1960s. The players of this side joined the new sports club SC Energie Cottbus in 1963, whilst the reserve team merged back to BSG Aktivist Brieske-Ost to form BSG Aktivist Senftenberg. The club still exists as FSV Glückauf Brieske-Senftenberg today. SC Cottbus was quickly assisted by a wholesale transfer of players from SC Aktivist Brieske-Ost ordered by the East German authorities, who often intervened in the business of the country&#x27;s sports and football clubs for political reasons. East German authorities had a penchant for tagging sports teams with the names of socialist heroes: Franz Mehring was a German socialist politician and journalist.

In the mid-1960s, a re-organization program by the regime led to the separation of football sides from sports clubs and the creation of BSG von Bodo Krautz under the patronage of a local coal mine. The football club went by that name only briefly and was quickly renamed BSG Energie in early 1966.

===German reunification===
The team took on the name FC Energie in 1990 at the time of German reunification.

After years as a II division or lower-table I division side in East Germany, Energie emerged as one of the few former DDR sides to enjoy relative prosperity in a united Germany. After six seasons playing tier III football, the club earned returned to the 2. Bundesliga in 1997 (the same year they became the first former East German club to play the DFB Cup Final), winning the Regionalliga Nordost, and then played its way into the Bundesliga in 2000, where it had a three-year stay. A key player in the Bundesliga run was Vasile Miriuță, an imaginative midfield player. After being relegated, Energie narrowly missed a prompt return to the top tier, losing out to Mainz 05 on goal difference.

In 2004–05, Energie struggled with both financial (reported debts of €4.5 million) and on-field problems, and the club only escaped relegation to the third tier Regionalliga by scoring one more goal than Eintracht Trier while having the same number of points and goal difference. During the season, manager Eduard Geyer was replaced by Petrik Sander and chairman Dieter Krein was replaced by Ulrich Lepsch. The 2005–06 season saw the club finish third and return to the Bundesliga.

The 2006–07 Bundesliga season resulted in a 13th-place finish and 41 points, a club record total in the Bundesliga. Energie Cottbus were the only club from the former East Germany playing in the Bundesliga until they lost a relegation play-off to 1. FC Nürnberg in 2009. Cottbus remained in the 2. Bundesliga for another five seasons until 2014, when an 18th-place finish meant returning to the 3. Liga, ending a 17-season stint in the top two divisions. After a 19th-place finish in the 3. Liga in 2015–16, the club went through another return to the Regionalliga Nordost.

===Recent seasons===
Following two seasons in the fourth tier, Cottbus returned to 3. Liga after defeating Weiche Flensburg over two legs in the Regionalliga play-offs, but in the 2018–19 season they were returned to the Regionalliga after finishing 17th.

On May 21, 2023, Cottbus won the Regionalliga Nordost with their win over SV Babelsberg 03 in Matchweek 33. It was their third time winning Regionalliga Nordost and their first since 2018. In the promotion games for 3. Liga, Cottbus lost two games against SpVgg Unterhaching and therefore promotion failed. On June 3, 2023, Cottbus won the Brandenburg Cup for the 11th time in their history. They defeated FSV 63 Luckenwalde by a score of 4–1. 

Cottbus ended the 2023–24 season as champion and was promoted to 3. Liga.

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an honorary member of the club.

<doc id="233026" wikidata="Q511092" url="?curid=233026" title="Eugenio Corini">
<text>Eugenio Corini (born 30 July 1970) is an Italian professional football coach and former player.

A talented, dynamic, and hard-working playmaker, known for his precise long passing, flair and his ability to orchestrate his team&#x27;s attacking moves or provide assists for teammates, Corini usually played either as an attacking midfielder or as a deep lying playmaker in midfield. A set-piece specialist, he was also known for his accuracy from free kicks, corners and penalty kicks.

== Club career ==
Corini began his career in the Brescia youth squad, but by age 16, he was called up to be included in the first team, making his debut the following season. He became a regular for Lombardian in 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons before being signed by Juventus.

In his first season with Juventus, at 20, Corini played 25 times and scored one goal.

In 1992–93, Corini was sold to Sampdoria, where he made 24 appearances and had several injury problems. In the next few years, Corini moved from team to team almost every season (Napoli, Brescia again and Piacenza) without being able to show his full potential.

In October 1998, Verona loaned him to city rivals Chievo, in Serie B. Corini soon became a mainstay of the team, leading his team as captain to an extraordinary promotion for Serie A in 2001, and 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA), after having been first-placed at the winter break.

Corini joined Palermo in 2003, helping them win the 2003–04 Serie B league title, followed by 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA). He later served as the club captain. In June 2007, he announced he would not renew his contract with Palermo. A few days later he was signed by Torino, age 37. He was confirmed with the &quot;Granata&quot; also for the 2008–09 season, which he stated it would be his final one as a footballer. In May 2009, Corini confirmed his retirement as a player after he failed to recover from a recurring Achilles tendon injury that forced him to have surgery, causing him to miss the final part of the season, which saw Torino being relegated to Serie B. He also stated his intention to try his hand at coaching in the future.

== International career ==
Corini became a regular also in the Italy u21 team of the early 1990s, winning a UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and representing Italy in the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona.

Despite his success for Italy at the youth level and for various club-level teams, he was never capped for the full national team in a career spanning almost two decades. However, he did receive call-ups during the 1992–93 season, as well as in November 2002.

== Managerial career ==
After announcing his retirement, Corini was successively linked to several vacancies in Italian football. On 5 July 2010, Corini was unveiled as the new head coach of Portosummaga, a newly promoted 2010–11 Serie B club; he agreed to become the club&#x27;s new head coach despite not having the required coaching badge qualification at the time of the appointment. He had only a UEFA A License, so UEFA Pro graduate Salvatore Giunta worked alongside him.

Unexpectedly, Corini left the club twelve days later, together with director of football Giuseppe Magalini, due to disagreements with the board regarding the transfer market policy and the future plans for the team.

On 27 November 2010, he was appointed head coach of Serie B club Crotone, replacing Leonardo Menichini. His experience with the Calabrian club turned out to be short-lived, as he was dismissed later on 20 February 2011, following a string of poor results that left Crotone in danger of relegation.

From 30 November 2011 through the end of the season, he coached Frosinone in Lega Pro Prima Divisione, replacing Carlo Sabatini.

On 2 October 2012, he was named the new head coach of Chievo in place of Domenico Di Carlo, after the team suffered five consecutive defeats in the first six games of the season. Corini and Chievo parted ways on 29 May 2013 by mutual consent; Corini returned to Chievo four months later, being appointed on 12 November 2013 to replace Giuseppe Sannino. He guided Chievo to maintain their Serie A status by the end of the season and was thus given the job on a permanent basis, but was subsequently sacked on 19 October following a 3-0 defeat to Roma that left the club with four points in seven games.

On 30 November 2016, Corini was appointed manager of Palermo. He resigned on 24 January 2017.

On 4 February 2018, he was fired as manager of Novara.

He returned to management on 18 September 2018, being named new head coach of Brescia, his first club as a player, in place of David Suazo. He was sacked on 3 November 2019. He was re-hired by Brescia on 2 December 2019. On 5 February 2020, he was dismissed by Brescia once more. He became head coach of Serie B club Lecce on 22 August 2020. After Lecce failed to gain promotion to Serie A at the end of the 2020–21 season by losing in the promotion play-offs, he was dismissed on 22 May 2021.

On 23 March 2022, Corini was announced as the new head coach of Serie B club Brescia, thus marking his return with the &quot;Rondinelle&quot;, two years after his last stint at the club. He guided Brescia to the promotion playoffs, where they were defeated by eventual winners Monza in the semi-finals; on 14 June 2022, Corini parted ways with Brescia by mutual consent.

On 7 August 2022, Corini agreed to return to Palermo as head coach, signing a two-year contract with the newly promoted Serie B club. After narrowly missing out on a promotion playoff spot, he was confirmed for one more season with a significantly strengthened squad and the goal of leading Palermo to a promotion spot; he was however sacked on 3 April 2024, following a last-minute 3–4 loss at Pisa that left the &quot;Rosanero&quot; in sixth place, far away from a direct promotion spot with seven games remaining.

On 9 October 2024, Corini took over as the new head coach of Serie B club Cremonese, signing a contract until the end of the 2024–25 season. His stint at Cremonese turned out to be short-lived, as he was dismissed just a month later, on 11 November, following two consecutive league defeats.

==Cubic foot per second and related flow rates==

The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot per second is ft3/s. The following other abbreviations are also sometimes used:
* ft3/sec
* cu ft/s
* cfs or CFS 
* cusec
* second-feet

The flow or discharge of rivers, i.e., the volume of water passing a location per unit of time, is commonly expressed in units of cubic feet per second or cubic metres per second.

Cusec is a unit of flow rate, used mostly in the United States in the context of water flow, particularly of rivers and canals.

Conversions: 1 ft3s−1 = = = = 

=== Cubic foot per minute ===
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot per minute is ft3/min. The following abbreviations are used:
* cu ft/min
* cfm or CFM 
* cfpm or CFPM

Cubic feet per minute is used to measure the amount of air that is being delivered, and is a common metric used for carburetors, pneumatic tools, and air-compressor systems.

== Standard cubic foot ==
A standard cubic foot (abbreviated scf) is a measure of quantity of gas, sometimes defined in terms of standard temperature and pressure as a cubic foot of volume at and of pressure.

<text>The wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) is a common and widespread leaf warbler which breeds throughout northern and temperate Europe, and just into the extreme west of Asian Russia in the southern Ural Mountains. 

This warbler is strongly migratory and the entire population winters in tropical Africa.

== Name ==
The genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific &quot;sibilatrix&quot; is Latin for &quot;she who whistles&quot;.

At the end of the nineteenth century the bird was also called &quot;wood-wren&quot;.

== Habitat ==

This is a bird of open but shady mature woodlands, such as beech and sessile oak, with some sparse ground cover for nesting. The dome-shaped nest is built near the ground in low shrub. Six or seven eggs are laid in May; there may be a second brood. Like most Old World warblers, this small passerine is insectivorous.

The main nest predators of wood warblers breeding in the primeval habitat of Białowieża Forest, Poland, are mammals, especially medium-sized carnivores, which mostly predate nests at night using sound or olfaction. Therefore, nest survival declined with nest progression likely due to increased predator detection of older and louder chicks.

== Description ==
The wood warbler is 11–12.5 cm long, and a typical leaf warbler in appearance, green above and white below with a lemon-yellow breast. It can be distinguished from similar species, like the chiffchaff &quot;P. collybita&quot; and the willow warbler, &quot;P. trochilus&quot; by its yellow supercilium, throat and upper breast, pale tertial edges, longer primary projection, and by its shorter but broader tail.

It is a summer visitor to the United Kingdom, seen from April until August. It has declined there in recent years. It is rare in Ireland, where there is a very small but apparently stable breeding population in County Wicklow.

Various factors associated with forest structure, including slope, forest cover, proportion of broad-leaf forest, canopy height and forest edge length, all influence the occupancy rates of this declining forest species. Conservation measures are therefore required that provide and maintain the wood warblers preferred forest structure. There is also a preference for forest in the non-breeding season; however, this habitat is declining in wintering areas such as Ghana. Despite the decline in forest habitat, there has been no change in the number of wood warblers as it appears that this species can use degraded habitats, such as well-wooded farms. However, further loss of trees will likely have a negative impact on this species in the future.

== Songs ==

It has two song types, often (but not always) given alternately; a high-pitched fluid metallic trill of increasing tempo lasting 2–3 seconds, and a series of 3 to 5 descending piping notes of lower pitch &quot;piüü-piüü-piüü&quot;. The contact call is a soft piping note, similar to the second song type, but shorter and given singly, &quot;piü&quot;.

<text>Vasile Miriuță (born 19 September 1968) is a professional football manager and former player, currently in charge of Liga I club Politehnica Iaşi.

Born in Romania, the midfielder played nine matches for the Hungary national team, in which he scored one goal in a friendly on 21 August 2002 against Spain. Famous for his free kicks and tactical cleverness, he promoted in the Bundesliga with Energie Cottbus in 2000, but was released at the end of 2002. Most of his time at MSV Duisburg he spent outside the starting eleven.

==Club career==
Miriuță debuted as a player in 1986 for Maramureș Baia Mare. In 1991, he was signed by Dinamo București. At Dinamo, Miriuță became an undisputed regular, until new coach Florin Halagian allegedly told him that he&#x27;s not going to play a single game in his term, prompting him to leave for Gloria Bistrița in 1991. After one season at Gloria, he returned at Dinamo.

===Hungary===
In 1992, tired with his status as a substitute at Dinamo, Miriuță signed with Hungarian side Győr. He soon became a popular figure among the supporters. In 1993, Miriuță was signed by French side Bourges, but returns to Győr after only one season. In 1996, Miriuță moved to Videoton, but after playing four games and scoring three goals for the Székesfehérvár club, he is signed by Ferencváros. After two years at Ferencváros, Miriuță signed with rivals Újpest, but did not play on league games for the Purples.

===Energie Cottbus===
In 1998, Miriuța signed with 2. Bundesliga side Energie Cottbus. He soon became undisputed regular for the club and helped the team avoid relegation in the Regionalliga Nordost in his first season for the club. In 2000, Miriuță promoted in Bundesliga with Cottbus, and during their first season in the top tier became one of the regulars of the famous all-foreign line-up. He scored 12 goals in Bundesliga in the 2000–01 season and was voted into the Bundesliga Best XI. Despite this, Miriuță was released in 2002.

===Late career===
In 2002, he signed with 2. Bundesliga side MSV Duisburg, but was mostly used as a substitute.

In 2003, Miriuță returned to Győr for the third time in his career, for a season. In 2004, he signed with Budapest Honvéd, but ended his contract following a dispute with the coach, then retired.

==International career==
In 2000, Miriuță received a phone call from a messenger of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announcing him that he obtained Hungarian citizenship, for which he applied in 1994, and asking him to play for the national team. He made his debut for Hungary in a 1–0 friendly win over Macedonia.

In three years playing for Hungary, Miriuță earned 9 caps and scored a goal in a 1–1 friendly draw against Spain.

<text>Hong Tianguifu (23 November 1849 – 18 November 1864) was the second and last king of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. He is popularly referred to as the Junior Lord (). Officially, like his father Hong Xiuquan, he was the King of Heaven (). To differentiate, he is also called the Junior King of Heaven ().

==History==
Hong was born in village in Hua County (present-day Huadu District), Guangdong. Initially given the first name Tiangui (天貴; &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Precious&quot;), his father added an additional character (福; &quot;happiness/&quot;blessing&quot;) around 1860, making his name unusual, as Chinese given names typically have only one or two characters. The name change came amid Hong Xiuquan&#x27;s increased focus on mysticism and belief that Hong was fit to replace him as &quot;worldly leader&quot;. In the kingdom&#x27;s hierarchy, Hong was referred to as &quot;The Young Monarch of 10,000 years&quot;, mirroring his father&#x27;s title &quot;Heavenly King, Lord of 10,000 years&quot;.

Hong succeeded his father on 2 June 1864, a day after his death, at age fourteen. He was not respected like his father by the kingdom&#x27;s princes and was spoken of poorly. In Li Xiucheng&#x27;s autobiography, written shortly before Li&#x27;s execution, Hong was described as &quot;inexperienced&quot;, &quot;spoiled&quot; and &quot;incapable&quot;. Hong also never rode a horse, which was essential for leaders and commanders in wars.

On 19 July 1864, six weeks after Hong&#x27;s coronation, the Qing government captured Tianjing, the capital of the Taiping rebels. Aided by Li Xiucheng, Hong escaped to , Jiangsu, disguised in Qing Army uniforms. Hong&#x27;s two younger brothers were killed during the clashes. They rendezvoused with his uncle Hong Rengan and first went to Guangde County, Anhui, before heading to the town of Huzhou, Zhejiang on 13 August 1864, where they rendezvoused with the local Taiping Army commander Huang Wenjin (). The Qing government sent Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang to attack the town. The Taiping Army commander in charge of defending the southern gate of the town, Chen Xueming (), surrendered on 26 August 1864. Hong Tianguifu, Hong Rengan and Huang Wenjin were forced to flee from the town next day, under the cover of night. Huang Wenjin soon died of his wounds. The rest of the survivors attempted to escape to the border region of Jiangxi and Fujian to join the remnant Taiping forces led by Li Shixian. However, on 9 October 1864, they were ambushed by the Qing army at Shicheng. Hong Tianguifu escaped to the mountains near Shicheng after his token force was wiped out, but he was caught on 25 October 1864 by Qing soldiers searching for him. Hong Rengan was captured and subsequently executed on 23 November 1864 at Nanchang, Jiangxi.

While being escorted by guards, Hong Tianguifu had a conversation with a Qing army soldier named Tang Jiatong. Hong first talked about his relationship with his father and others. He said, &quot;The old affairs of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were done by my father and Hong Renxuan, he sat on the throne. What did it have to do with me? Even after ascending the throne, I did nothing that is unfavorable to the Qing dynasty. The ones who resisted the Qing Empire were Prince Gan, Prince Zhong and the other [princes].&quot; () After the second day of writing a poem praising the Qing dynasty, he was executed by slow slicing on 18 November 1864 at the age of 14.

A glimpse of Hong Tianguifu&#x27;s character can be seen by his remarks before his execution: &quot;Guangdong is not a nice place, I do not want to go back in. I just want to study with Old Master Tang in Hunan, and I want to be a good scholar&quot; (). This apparently innocent, pointless, and irrelevant comment was considered by some as a desperate and futile attempt to avoid death by confusing the executioner of his identity. It may also have reflected his lack of understanding of what was happening to him and his lost kingdom.

Despite his short reign as king, he was still issued an official seal made of jade (), which is exhibited in the Hong Kong Museum of History.
