<text>Marinduque (; ), officially the Province of Marinduque, is an island province in the Philippines located in Southwestern Tagalog Region or Mimaropa, formerly designated as Region IV-B. Its capital is the municipality of Boac, the most populous in the province. Marinduque lies between Tayabas Bay to the north and Sibuyan Sea to the south. It is west of the Bondoc Peninsula of Quezon province in mainland Luzon; east of Mindoro Island; and north of the island province of Romblon. Some parts of the Verde Island Passage, the center of the center of world&#x27;s marine biodiversity and a protected marine area, are also within Marinduque&#x27;s provincial waters.

The province of Marinduque was ranked number 1 by the Philippine National Police and Philippine Security Forces as the 2013 Most Peaceful Province of the country due to its low crime rate statistics alternately ranking with the province of Batanes yearly. Furthermore, for almost 200 years, the province is home to one of the oldest religious festivals of the country, the Moriones celebrated annually every Holy Week.

==Etymology==
The most accepted theory of the etymology of the province&#x27;s name is a Hispanized corruption of either &quot;malindig&quot; or &quot;malindug&quot;, which means &quot;stand tall&quot; or &quot;elegant&quot;, in reference to a potentially active volcano in the southern section of the island, the Mount Malindig.

In 1676, Domingo Navarette wrote in &quot;Tratados historicos...&quot;, &quot;The island which the people from there call &quot;Minolo&quot; is named &quot;Mindoro&quot; by the Spaniards, and that of &quot;Malindic&quot; we call &quot;Marinduque&quot;.&quot; (trans. by E.H. Blaire and J.A. Robertson)

==History==
===Middle ages===
The island was called Malindig in Tagalog and Malindog in Visayan languages. It was likely a constituent of the Kingdom of Luzon, due to the immediate Spanish claims to the island after the fall of Manila in May 1570.

It is possible that there were nobility who ruled Malindig since there are principalia or princely figures in Marinduque during Spanish rule.

===Spanish rule===
From the Visayan name Malindog, Marinduque became the name of the island in Castilian.

In 1571, Governor-General Miguel López de Legaspi had entrusted (&quot;encomienda&quot;) Marinduque to Fr. Pedro de Herrera, the first Augustinian priest who introduced Christianity to Marinduqueños.

Marinduque was part of the province of Balayan (now Batangas) in the 16th century, and of Mindoro from the 17th to 19th century.

Antoine-Alfred Marche, a French naturalist, carried out an archaeological investigation in Marinduque from April to July 1881. An abundant yield of urns, vases, gold ornaments, skulls, and other ornaments were found. He brought these to France in 40 crates. Part of it is said to be housed at the &quot;Musée de l&#x27;Homme&quot; (&quot;museum of man&quot;) in France. The finds also included an image of wooden polytheistic religious statues (&quot;anito&quot;) which at the time were already called &quot;pastores&quot; by Marinduqueños.

One of the artifacts found by Marche also found its way to the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. (Catalogue No. A127996-0, Department of Anthropology, NMNH, Smithsonian Institution). Fragile jarlets that were found were said to have travelled from China to Marinduque. Buried in a cave for centuries and excavated in the late 19th century, these were brought to Paris and one was then brought at the Smithsonian Institution museum.

===First Philippine Republic===
Marinduque, governed through the province of Mindoro, was a constituent of the first Philippine Republic from January 1899 to April 1901 under Pres. Emilio Aguinaldo.

During the Philippine–American War, Marinduque was the first province where American invaders established concentration camps. In the Battle of Pulang Lupa, under the direction of Colonel Maximo Abad, 250 Filipino soldiers defeated 54 American infantrymen.

===American rule===
Col. Abad after capturing the Americans later surrendered on 15 April 1901, upon orders from Pres. Aguinaldo and due to the capture of Gov. Martin Lardizabal and two other officials who were held hostage by the Americans at Fort Santiago.

On 23 June 1902, by virtue of Act No. 423, the US-Philippine Commission annexed the islands of Mindoro (now two separate provinces) and Lubang (now part of Occidental Mindoro) to the province. Four months later, on the 10th of November, Marinduque was annexed to the province of Tayabas (now Quezon) by virtue of an Act No. 499.

On 21 February 1920, Act No. 2280 was passed by the Philippine Congress, reestablishing Marinduque as a separate province.

According to Henry Otley Beyer, an American anthropologist, while many other accidental discoveries and finds have been recorded from time to time and European and Filipino scientists had casually explored a few burial caves and sites, no systematic work had been done anywhere else prior to these explorations. After Marche, the next important archaeological work was undertaken by Dr. Carl Gunthe in the Visayas Island Group in 1922.

===Commonwealth of the Philippines===

In November 1935, Marinduque became a province of the Commonwealth of the Philippines under Pres. Manuel Quezon. The Philippine Commonwealth Army was stationed in the province; the general headquarters was active from 1935 to 1942.

===Japanese occupation===
In 1942, during the Second World War, Japanese Imperial forces landed on Marinduque. The province was re-annexed to Tayabas, but re-established as an independent province in 1945.

===Second Philippine Republic===

In October 1943, Marinduque became a province of the Second Philippine Republic under Pres. Jose Laurel. The sovereign, however, was the Japanese emperor.

In 1945, combined American and Filipino troops liberated the province from Japanese forces, returning the province to the Commonwealth of the Philippines under Pres. Sergio Osmeña. In addition to the return of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, the Philippine Constabulary was also stationed in the province. These were active from 1945 to 1946.

===Third Philippine Republic to present===

Archaeological findings that help inform Marinduque&#x27;s history are exhibited at the Marinduque Museum in Poblacion at Boac and in foreign museums. The artifacts are to be analysed to aid the historiography of the island and the province.

==Geography==

Marinduque is considered as the geographical center of the Philippine archipelago by the Luzon Datum of 1911, the mother of all Philippine geodetic surveys. The province is a &quot;heart-shaped&quot; island with a total land area of , situated between Tayabas Bay in the north and Sibuyan Sea to the south. It is separated from the Bondoc Peninsula in Quezon by the Mompong Pass. West of Marinduque is Tablas Strait, which separates it from Mindoro Island.

Some of the smaller islands to the northeast are Polo Island, Maniwaya Island, and Mompong Island. Southwest portion includes the Tres Reyes Islands and Elephant Island.

The highest peak in Marinduque is Mount Malindig (formerly called Mt. Marlanga), a potentially active stratovolcano with an elevation of above sea level, located at the southern tip of the island.

Cave Systems

Various cave systems occupy the province, including:
* Bathala Cave located near Barangay Ipil in Sta. Cruz town;
* Tarug Caves located at Barangay Tarug, in the town of Mogpog, a three-chambered caves of limestone formation. It rises steeply to 270 feet above the ground and is located 331 ft above sea level. Pinnacle is barely 3 square meters.
* Bagumbungan Cave, a cave system in San Isidro and Punong with complex subterranean river
* Talao Caves, a 12 series of caves overlooking the western part of the island.

===Climate===
Marinduque has a Type III climate, having rainfall more or less evenly distributed throughout the year with no clear boundary between dry and wet seasons. The annual mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures were calculated at , and respectively. Humidity average is 78% year-round with an average annual rainfall totaling .

===Administrative divisions===
Marinduque comprises 6 municipalities, further subdivided into 218 barangays. A double legislative districts encompasses all towns.

;Boac: The capital of the province. The most populous town in the province Boac remains the center of industry, culture, economy, and education. Most government and private offices are in the municipality of Boac. It also borders all five municipalities. Mogpog to the North, Santa Cruz to the Northeast, Torrijos to the East, Buenavista to the South, and Gasan to the Southwest. Boac is named after the Tagalog word, , which means divided, due to the Boac River dividing the town in the geographic north and south.

;Gasan: The Cultural Nerve Center of the province. Dubbed as one of the cleanest and greenest municipalities in the Philippines, Gasan&#x27;s land area covers a forest reserve in the eastern part. It is also the gateway to the island of Mindoro. Handicrafts and the famous Kalutang boasts from the town of Gasan. It was named after , a local term for corals found in the municipality.

;Buenavista: The smallest of the six municipalities. It was once part of the municipality of Gasan known as Sabang. It was named such because of the &quot;good view&quot; of the Tablas Strait and offshore islands.

;Torrijos: Named after three purported origins; 1) from Gen. Torrijos, 2) from &quot;torrillos&quot;, referring to the cows which pastured in its vast plains, and 3) from &quot;torre y hijos&quot;, referring to the watchtower men guarding the parish. Torrijos is deemed to be the summer capital of the Province and known for locally-grown strawberries.

;Santa Cruz: The largest of all the six municipalities in terms of land area and the second most populous town after Boac . It is considered as a secondary municipality after Boac (since it is the capital). Together with Boac, it is also a first-class municipality with established industries and commercial routines.

;Mogpog: The Primary Gateway of the Province through the Balanacan Port. It is the original home of the Moriones Lenten Rites and Kangga Festiva. Mogpog was named after the Tagalog word, or kiln makers abundant in the municipality.

==Demographics==
The population of Marinduque in the 2020 census was 239,207 people, with a density of , hence, it is the most densely populated province in the Mimaropa Region.

===Religion===
Marinduque is resided by various religious groups, with Catholics making up the greatest proportion with 70%. The Iglesia Filipina Independiente has 25% of the population and the rest belongs to the different denominations such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Iglesia ni Cristo, and various Mainline Protestant denominations which include Assemblies of God, Baptists, JIL, Methodists, Presbyterian, Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA), and the non-denominational Evangelical churches also known as Born-Again Christians. Muslims, Anitists, animists, and atheists are also present in the province.

===Language===
The version of Tagalog spoken in Marinduque, known as the &quot;Marinduque Tagalog&quot;, has been described as &quot;the root from which modern national forms of speech have sprung,&quot; where remnants of archaic Tagalog could be found, spoken in a lilting manner by its inhabitants. If this linguistic theory is accurate, Marinduque&#x27;s Tagalog has contributed significantly to the development of the official Philippine national language.

To this day, Marinduqueños speak an old variation of the Tagalog language that is very close to the way Tagalog was spoken before the Spanish colonization. According to language experts , the Tagalog dialects of Marinduque are the most divergent, especially the Eastern Marinduque dialect, perhaps due to the relative isolation from the Tagalogs of mainland Luzon and also perhaps due to the influence of the Visayan and Bikol migrants. Many educated Marinduqueños speak version of Tagalog during Spanish colonial era and with English terms, closer to modern Filipino or standard Tagalog, because of mass media and modern versions of Tagalog Bible, and retaining Visayan and Bikol influence.

Linguist Rosa Soberano&#x27;s 1980 &quot;The Dialects of Marinduque Tagalog&quot; goes into great depth concerning the dialects spoken there. The following is a verb chart which outlines the conjugation of the Eastern Marinduque dialect of Tagalog:

Linguist Christopher Sundita observed that some of the affixes in Marinduque Tagalog, particularly &quot;a-&quot; and &quot;ina-,&quot; are affixes used in Asi (Bantoanon), a Visaya language spoken in Romblon, just south of Marinduque. Marinduque Tagalog, like the Tagalog spoken over two centuries ago, had an additional verb category, the imperative, which was used for commands and requests (e.g., Matulog ka na - Go to sleep). Even then, the imperative and the infinitive were used side by side in expressing commands; but in standard Tagalog, apparently the infinitive became used exclusively. And in the Eastern Marinduque dialect, the imperative affixes are very much alive.

==Economy==

Marinduque is an agricultural province, primarily growing rice and coconuts. Handicrafts from Marinduque are also exported to dıfferent parts of the world, and fishing is another important part of the economy. Mining was once an important player in the economy until a mining accident (the Marcopper Mining Disaster) occurred, bringing the industry to a standstill on the island and causing enormous damage to the inhabitants. The provincial government has just recently sued Marcopper&#x27;s parent company, Placer Dome, for $100 million in damages. Placer Dome was purchased in 2006 by Barrick Gold, who has now been joined in the lawsuit.

A significant role in Marinduque&#x27;s economy is also played by tourism, especially during the Lenten season. While this is not one of the larger parts of the island&#x27;s economy, it has shown great growth. Recently, some residents are now engaged in butterfly farming. Butterflies are raised for export to countries in both Europe and the Americas. Locally, live butterflies are released in celebration on different occasions, such as birthdays, weddings, and some corporate events.
==Culture==

=== Festivals ===
The Moriones Festival is an annual festival, locally known as &quot;Moryonan&quot;, celebrated in Marinduque from March to April. In Santa Cruz, Gasan, Boac, and Mogpog, a parade of people dressed as &quot;Moryons&quot; can be seen on the main road connecting the towns of the island. Boac and Santa Cruz, the biggest towns in the province, shows a reenactment in the evening of the actual event when Longinus, a blind soldier, punctures Jesus with his spear and blood droplets from the wound restores Longinus&#x27;s sight.

=== Music ===
Marinduque is home to the kalutang, a musical instrument made of two pieces of wood that produce different note ranges depending on its size. A band of 10 to 12 can create music with this instrument. In 2011, the &quot;kalutang instrument&quot; was cited by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the traditional craftsmanship category that the government may nominate in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

==Government==
Marinduque has had its own Governor running a sub-government under Tayabas (now Quezon) in 1902 and as a provincial government after gaining its independence from Tayabas in 1920. The Governor is assisted by the Vice Governor, who presides over the Marinduque Provincial Board.

==Transport==

Marinduque is served by direct Cebu Pacific flights to-and-from Manila and Marinduque Airport which is located in Masiga, roughly between Gasan and Boac. The province is also served by a seaport in Balanacan transporting cargo and passengers to and from Lucena in Quezon province. There is also a daily boat trip from General Luna in Quezon province to Santa Cruz and vice versa which stops at Maniwaya Island to drop off cargo and passengers.

==Media==
There are four radio stations in the province, three of which are operated by the Radyo Natin Network and the other, FM Nutriskwela Community Radio Station Radyo Kamalindig 94.1 DZNS, by the National Nutrition Council. Radyo Natin Network operates the call sign DZVH at 105.7 MHz on FM radio from Boac, as well as the call sign DWMD 104.5 MHz on FM radio from Santa Cruz and 100.1 FM from Torrijos. As for print media, there is no existing newspapers circulating in the province, aside from broadsheet and tabloid newspapers from Manila. Marinduque News Network, meanwhile, provides provincial and national news and information via the web and social media. In 2018, Marinduque News Network ventured with Lucky Seven Cable Services Corporation, a cable provider in Marinduque to showcase their programs through local cable television. The online news website which was founded by Romeo Mataac, Jr. in 2016 is located in Boac, Marinduque.

There are also existing cable providers and local cable stations operating in several municipalities in the province, namely Lucky Seven Cable Services Corporation (Boac), Marinduque Cable Television, Inc. (Boac), and G.R. CATV Services (Santa Cruz &amp; Torrijos). Aside from these cable stations, there are also distributors of direct-to-home (DTH) satellite TV such as Cignal Digital TV, Dream Satellite TV, G Sat, and Sky Direct who provide television services for its subscribers.

<text>National security, or national defence (national defense in American English), is the security and defence of a sovereign state, including its citizens, economy, and institutions, which is regarded as a duty of government. Originally conceived as protection against military attack, national security is widely understood to include also non-military dimensions, such as the security from terrorism, minimization of crime, economic security, energy security, environmental security, food security, and cyber-security. Similarly, national security risks include, in addition to the actions of other states, action by violent non-state actors, by narcotic cartels, organized crime, by multinational corporations, and also the effects of natural disasters.

Governments rely on a range of measures, including political, economic, and military power, as well as diplomacy, to safeguard the security of a state. They may also act to build the conditions of security regionally and internationally by reducing transnational causes of insecurity, such as climate change, economic inequality, political exclusion, and nuclear proliferation.

== Definitions ==
The concept of national security remains ambiguous, having evolved from simpler definitions which emphasised freedom from military threat and from political coercion. Among the many definitions proposed to date are the following, which show how the concept has evolved to encompass non-military concerns:
* &quot;A nation has security when it does not have to sacrifice its legitimate interests to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by war.&quot; (Walter Lippmann, 1943).
* &quot;The distinctive meaning of national security means freedom from foreign dictation.&quot; (Harold Lasswell, 1950)
* &quot;National security objectively means the absence of threats to acquired values and subjectively, the absence of fear that such values will be attacked.&quot; (Arnold Wolfers, 1960)
* &quot;National security then is the ability to preserve the nation&#x27;s physical integrity and territory; to maintain its economic relations with the rest of the world on reasonable terms; to preserve its nature, institution, and governance from disruption from outside; and to control its borders.&quot; (Harold Brown, U.S. Secretary of Defense, 1977–1981)
* &quot;National security... is best described as a capacity to control those domestic and foreign conditions that the public opinion of a given community believes necessary to enjoy its own self-determination or autonomy, prosperity, and wellbeing.&quot; (Charles Maier, 1990)
* &quot;National security is an appropriate and aggressive blend of political resilience and maturity, human resources, economic structure and capacity, technological competence, industrial base and availability of natural resources and finally the military might.&quot; (National Defence College of India, 1996)
* &quot;[National security is the] measurable state of the capability of a nation to overcome the multi-dimensional threats to the apparent well-being of its people and its survival as a nation-state at any given time, by balancing all instruments of state policy through governance... and is extendable to global security by variables external to it.&quot; (Prabhakaran Paleri, 2008)

== Dimensions ==
Potential causes of national insecurity include actions by other states (e.g. military or cyber attack), violent non-state actors (e.g. terrorist attack), organised criminal groups such as narcotic cartels, and also the effects of natural disasters (e.g. flooding, earthquakes). Systemic drivers of insecurity, which may be transnational, include climate change, economic inequality and marginalisation, political exclusion, and nuclear proliferation.

In view of the wide range of risks, the security of a state has several dimensions, including economic security, energy security, physical security, environmental security, food security, border security, and cyber security. These dimensions correlate closely with elements of national power.

Increasingly, governments organise their security policies into a national security strategy (NSS); as of 2017, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States are among the states to have done so. Some states also appoint a National Security Council and/or a National Security Advisor which is an executive government agency, it feeds the head of the state on topics concerning national security and strategic interest. The national security council/advisor strategies long term, short term, contingency national security plans. India holds one such system in current, which was established on 19 November 1998.

Although states differ in their approach, various forms of coercive power predominate, particularly military capabilities. The scope of these capabilities has developed. Traditionally, military capabilities were mainly land- or sea-based, and in smaller countries, they still are. Elsewhere, the domains of potential warfare now include the air, space, cyberspace, and psychological operations. Military capabilities designed for these domains may be used for national security, or equally for offensive purposes, for example to conquer and annex territory and resources.

=== Physical ===
In practice, national security is associated primarily with managing physical threats and with the military capabilities used for doing so. That is, national security is often understood as the capacity of a nation to mobilise military forces to guarantee its borders and to deter or successfully defend against physical threats including military aggression and attacks by non-state actors, such as terrorism. Most states, such as South Africa and Sweden, configure their military forces mainly for territorial defence; others, such as France, Russia, the UK and the US, invest in higher-cost expeditionary capabilities, which allow their armed forces to project power and sustain military operations abroad.

=== Infrastructural ===
Infrastructure security is the security provided to protect infrastructure, especially critical infrastructure, such as airports, highways, rail transport, hospitals, bridges, transport hubs, network communications, media, the electricity grid, dams, power plants, seaports, oil refineries, and water systems. Infrastructure security seeks to limit vulnerability of these structures and systems to sabotage, terrorism, and contamination.

Many countries have established government agencies to directly manage the security of critical infrastructure, usually, through the Ministry of Interior/Home Affairs, dedicated security agencies to protect facilities such as United States Federal Protective Service, and also dedicated transport police such as the British Transport Police. There are also commercial transportation security units such as the Amtrak Police in the United States. Critical infrastructure is vital for the essential functioning of a country. Incidental or deliberate damage can have a serious impact on the economy and essential services. Some of the threats to infrastructure include:

* Terrorism: person or groups deliberately targeting critical infrastructure for political gain. In the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Mumbai central station and hospital were deliberately targeted.
* Sabotage: person or groups such as ex-employees, anti-government groups, environmental groups. Refer to Bangkok&#x27;s International Airport Seized by Protestors.
* Information warfare: private person hacking for private gain or countries initiating attacks to glean information and damage a country&#x27;s cyberinfrastructure. Cyberattacks on Estonia and cyberattacks during the 2008 South Ossetia war are examples.
* Natural disaster: hurricane or other natural events that damage critical infrastructures such as oil pipelines, water, and power grids. See Hurricane Ike and Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina for examples.

=== Virtual ===

Computer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, refers to the security of computing devices such as computers and smartphones, as well as computer networks such as private and public networks, and the Internet. It concerns the protection of hardware, software, data, people, and also the procedures by which systems are accessed, and the field has growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems in most societies. Since unauthorized access to critical civil and military infrastructure is now considered a major threat, cyberspace is now recognised as a domain of warfare. One such example is the use of Stuxnet by the US and Israel against the Iranian nuclear programme

=== Political ===

Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver, Jaap de Wilde and others have argued that national security depends on political security: the stability of the social order. Others, such as Paul Rogers, have added that the equitability of the international order is equally vital. Hence, political security depends on the rule of international law (including the laws of war), the effectiveness of international political institutions, as well as diplomacy and negotiation between nations and other security actors. It also depends on, among other factors, effective political inclusion of disaffected groups and the human security of the citizenry.

=== Economic ===

Economic security, in the context of international relations, is the ability of a nation state to maintain and develop the national economy, without which other dimensions of national security cannot be managed. Economic capability largely determines the defence capability of a nation, and thus a sound economic security directly influences the national security of a nation. That is why we see countries with sound economy, happen to have sound security setup too, such as The United States, China, India among others. In larger countries, strategies for economic security expect to access resources and markets in other countries and to protect their own markets at home. Developing countries may be less secure than economically advanced states due to high rates of unemployment and underpaid work.

=== Environmental ===

Environmental security, also known as ecological security, refers to the integrity of ecosystems and the biosphere, particularly in relation to their capacity to sustain a diversity of life-forms (including human life). The security of ecosystems has attracted greater attention as the impact of ecological damage by humans has grown. The degradation of ecosystems, including topsoil erosion, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change, affect economic security and can precipitate mass migration, leading to increased pressure on resources elsewhere. Ecological security is also important since most of the countries in the world are developing and dependent on agriculture and agriculture gets affected largely due to climate change. This effect affects the economy of the nation, which in turn affects national security.

The scope and nature of environmental threats to national security and strategies to engage them are a subject of debate. Romm (1993) classifies the major impacts of ecological changes on national security as:
* &quot;Transnational environmental problems.&quot; These include global environmental problems such as climate change due to global warming, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.
* &quot;Local environmental or resource pressures&quot;. These include resource scarcities leading to local conflict, such as disputes over water scarcity in the Middle East; migration into the United States caused by the failure of agriculture in Mexico; and the impact on the conflict in Syria of erosion of productive land. Environmental insecurity in Rwanda following a rise in population and dwindling availability of farmland, may also have contributed to the genocide there.
* &quot;Environmentally threatening outcomes of warfare.&quot; These include acts of war that degrade or destroy ecosystems. Examples are the Roman Empire destruction of agriculture in Carthage; Saddam Hussein&#x27;s burning of oil wells in the Gulf War; the use of Agent Orange by the UK in the Malayan Emergency and the US in the Vietnam War for defoliating forests.

===Energy and natural resources===

Resources include water, sources of energy, land, and minerals. Availability of adequate natural resources is important for a nation to develop its industry and economic power. For example, in the Persian Gulf War of 1991, Iraq captured Kuwait partly in order to secure access to its oil wells, and one reason for the US counter-invasion was the value of the same wells to its own economy. Water resources are subject to disputes between many nations, including India and Pakistan, and in the Middle East.

The interrelations between security, energy, natural resources, and their sustainability is increasingly acknowledged in national security strategies and resource security is now included among the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In the US, for example, the military has installed solar photovoltaic microgrids on their bases in case of power outage.

== Issues ==

=== Consistency of approach ===
The dimensions of national security outlined above are frequently in tension with one another. For example:
* The high cost of maintaining large military forces can place a burden on the economic security of a nation And annual defence spending as per cent of GDP varies significantly by country. Conversely, economic constraints can limit the scale of expenditure on military capabilities.
* Unilateral security action by states can undermine political security at an international level if it erodes the rule of law and undermines the authority of international institutions. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the annexation of Crimea in 2014 have been cited as examples.
* The pursuit of economic security in competition with other nation states can undermine the ecological security of all when the impact includes widespread topsoil erosion, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Conversely, expenditure on mitigating or adapting to ecological change places a burden on the national economy.
If tensions such as these are mismanaged, national security policies and actions may be ineffective or counterproductive.

=== Versus transnational security ===
Increasingly, national security strategies have begun to recognise that nations cannot provide for their own security without also developing the security of their regional and international context. For example, Sweden&#x27;s national security strategy of 2017 declared:&quot;Wider security measures must also now encompass protection against epidemics and infectious diseases, combating terrorism and organised crime, ensuring safe transport and reliable food supplies, protecting against energy supply interruptions, countering devastating climate change, initiatives for peace and global development, and much more.&quot;
The extent to which this matters, and how it should be done, is the subject of debate. Some argue that the principal beneficiary of national security policy should be the nation state itself, which should centre its strategy on protective and coercive capabilities in order to safeguard itself in a hostile environment (and potentially to project that power into its environment, and dominate it to the point of strategic supremacy). Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships between nations can develop, partly by reducing antagonism between actors, ensuring that fundamental needs can be met, and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively. In the UK, for example, Malcolm Chalmers argued in 2015 that the heart of the UK&#x27;s approach should be support for the Western strategic military alliance led through NATO by the United States, as &quot;the key anchor around which international order is maintained&quot;.

=== Civil liberties and human rights ===
Approaches to national security can have a complex impact on human rights and civil liberties. For example, the rights and liberties of citizens are affected by the use of military personnel and militarised police forces to control public behaviour; the use of surveillance, including mass surveillance in cyberspace, which has implications for privacy; military recruitment and conscription practices; and the effects of warfare on civilians and civil infrastructure. This has led to a dialectical struggle, particularly in liberal democracies, between government authority and the rights and freedoms of the general public.

Even where the exercise of national security is subject to good governance, and the rule of law, a risk remains that the term &quot;national security&quot; may become a pretext for suppressing unfavorable political and social views. In the US, for example, the controversial USA Patriot Act of 2001, and the revelation by Edward Snowden in 2013 that the National Security Agency harvests the personal data of the general public, brought these issues to wide public attention. Among the questions raised are whether and how national security considerations at times of war should lead to the suppression of individual rights and freedoms, and whether such restrictions are necessary when a state is at peace.

== By region ==
=== Argentina and Brazil ===
National security ideology as taught by the US Army School of the Americas to military personnel was vital in causing the military coup of 1964 in Brazil and the 1976 one in Argentina. The military dictatorships were installed on the claim by the military that Leftists were an existential threat to the national interests.

=== China ===

China&#x27;s military is the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). The military is the largest in the world, with 2.3 million active troops in 2005.

The Ministry of State Security was established in 1983 to ensure &quot;the security of the state through effective measures against enemy agents, spies, and counterrevolutionary activities designed to sabotage or overthrow China&#x27;s socialist system.&quot;

=== European Union ===

For Schengen area some parts of national security and external border control are enforced by Frontex according to the Treaty of Lisbon. The security policy of the European Union is set by High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and assisted by European External Action Service. Europol is one of the agencies of the European Union responsible for combating various forms of crime in the European Union through coordinating law enforcement agencies of the EU member states.

European Union national security has been accused of insufficiently preventing foreign threats.

=== India ===
The state of the Republic of India&#x27;s national security is determined by its internal stability and geopolitical interests. While Islamic upsurge in Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir demanding secession and far left-wing terrorism in India&#x27;s red corridor remain some key issues in India&#x27;s internal security, terrorism from Pakistan-based militant groups has been emerging as a major concern for New Delhi.

The National Security Advisor of India heads the National Security Council of India, receives all kinds of intelligence reports, and is chief advisor to the Prime Minister of India over national and international security policy. The National Security Council has India&#x27;s defence, foreign, home, finance ministers and deputy chairman of NITI Aayog as its members and is responsible for shaping strategies for India&#x27;s security in all aspects.

A lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay filed a Public interest litigation (PIL) in the &quot;Supreme Court of India&quot; (SC) to identify and deport illegal immigrants. Responding to this PIL, Delhi Police told the SC in July 2019 that nearly 500 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants have been deported in the preceding 28 months. There are estimated 600,000 to 700,000 illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants in National Capital Region (NCR) region specially in the districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, and Nuh (Mewat region), as well as interior villages of Bhiwani and Hisar. Most of them are Muslims who have acquired fake Hindu identity, and under questioning, they pretend to be from West Bengal. In September 2019, the Chief Minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar announced the implementation of NRC for Haryana by setting up a legal framework under the former judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Justice HS Bhalla for updating NRC which will help in weeding out these illegal immigrants.

=== Russia ===
In the years 1997 and 2000, Russia adopted documents titled &quot;National Security Concept&quot; that described Russia&#x27;s global position, the country&#x27;s interests, listed threats to national security, and described the means to counter those threats. In 2009, these documents were superseded by the &quot;National Security Strategy to 2020&quot;. The key body responsible for coordinating policies related to Russia&#x27;s national security is the Security Council of Russia.

According to provision 6 of the &quot;National Security Strategy to 2020&quot;, national security is &quot;the situation in which the individual, the society and the state enjoy protection from foreign and domestic threats to the degree that ensures constitutional rights and freedoms, decent quality of life for citizens, as well as sovereignty, territorial integrity and stable development of the Russian Federation, the defence and security of the state.&quot;

=== Singapore ===

Total Defence is Singapore&#x27;s whole-of-society national defence concept based on the premise that the strongest defence of a nation is collective defence – when every aspect of society stays united for the defence of the country. Adopted from the national defence strategies of Sweden and Switzerland, Total Defence was introduced in Singapore in 1984. Then, it was recognised that military threats to a nation can affect the psyche and social fabric of its people. Therefore, the defence and progress of Singapore are dependent on all of its citizens&#x27; resolve, along with the government and armed forces. Total Defence has since evolved to take into consideration threats and challenges outside of the conventional military domain.

=== Ukraine ===
National security of Ukraine is defined in Ukrainian law as &quot;a set of legislative and organisational measures aimed at permanent protection of vital interests of man and citizen, society and the state, which ensure sustainable development of society, timely detection, prevention and neutralisation of real and potential threats to national interests in areas of law enforcement, fight against corruption, border activities and defence, migration policy, health care, education and science, technology and innovation policy, cultural development of the population, freedom of speech and information security, social policy and pension provision, housing and communal services, financial services market, protection of property rights, stock markets and circulation of securities, fiscal and customs policy, trade and business, banking services, investment policy, auditing, monetary and exchange rate policy, information security, licensing, industry and agriculture, transport and communications, information technology, energy and energy saving, functioning of natural monopolies, use of subsoil, land and water resources, minerals, protection of ecology and environment and other areas of public administration, in the event of emergence of negative trends towards the creation of potential or real threats to national interests.&quot;

The primary body responsible for coordinating national security policy in Ukraine is the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. 
It is an advisory state agency to the President of Ukraine, tasked with developing a policy of national security on domestic and international matters. All sessions of the council take place in the Presidential Administration Building. The council was created by the provision of Supreme Council of Ukraine #1658-12 on October 11, 1991. It was defined as the highest state body of collegiate governing on matters of defence and security of Ukraine with the following goals:

* Protecting sovereignty
* Constitutional order
* Territorial integrity and inviolability of the republic
* Developing strategies and continuous improvement of policy in the sphere of defence and state security
* Comprehensive scientific assessment of the military threat nature
* Determining position toward modern warfare
* Effective control over the execution of the tasks of the state and its institutions keeping defence capabilities of Ukraine at the level of defence sufficiency

=== United Kingdom ===
The primary body responsible for coordinating national security policy in the UK is the National Security Council (United Kingdom) which helps produce and enact the UK&#x27;s National Security Strategy. It was created in May 2010 by the new coalition government of the Conservative Party (UK) and Liberal Democrats. The National Security Council is a committee of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom and was created as part of a wider reform of the national security apparatus. This reform also included the creation of a National Security Adviser and a National Security Secretariat to support the National Security Council.

=== United States ===
==== National Security Act of 1947 ====

The concept of national security became an official guiding principle of foreign policy in the United States when the National Security Act of 1947 was signed on July 26, 1947, by U.S. President Harry S. Truman. As amended in 1949, this Act:
:* created important components of American national security, such as the precursor to the Department of Defense;
:* subordinated the military branches to the new cabinet-level position of Secretary of Defense;
:* established the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency;

Notably, the Act did &quot;not&quot; define national security, which was conceivably advantageous, as its ambiguity made it a powerful phrase to invoke against diverse threats to interests of the state, such as domestic concerns.

The notion that national security encompasses more than just military security was present, though understated, from the beginning. The Act established the National Security Council so as to &quot;advise the President on the integration of domestic, military and foreign policies relating to national security&quot;.

The act establishes, within the National Security Council, the Committee on Foreign Intelligence, whose duty is to conduct an annual review &quot;identifying the intelligence required to address the national security interests of the United States &quot;as specified by the President&quot;&quot; (emphasis added).

In Gen. Maxwell Taylor&#x27;s 1974 essay &quot;The Legitimate Claims of National Security&quot;, Taylor states:

==== National security state ====
To address the institutionalisation of new bureaucracies and government practices in the post–World War II period in the U.S., the culture of semi-permanent military mobilisation joined the National Security Council (NSC), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) for the practical application of the concept of the &quot;national security state&quot;:

Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer offers a seven-characteristic definition for &#x27;national security state&#x27; as where the military and broader national security establishment, e.g., exert influence over political and economic affairs; hold ultimate power while maintaining an appearance of democracy; are preoccupied with external and/or internal enemies; define policies in secret and implement those policies through covert channels.

==== Obama administration ====
The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff defines national security of the United States in the following manner :
In 2010, the White House included an all-encompassing world-view in a national security strategy which identified &quot;security&quot; as one of the country&#x27;s &quot;four enduring national interests&quot; that were &quot;inexorably intertwined&quot;:
==== Empowerment of women ====

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that, &quot;The countries that threaten regional and global peace are the very places where women and girls are deprived of dignity and opportunity&quot;. She has noted that countries, where women are oppressed, are places where the &quot;rule of law and democracy are struggling to take root&quot;, and that, when women&#x27;s rights as equals in society are upheld, the society as a whole changes and improves, which in turn enhances stability in that society, which in turn contributes to global society.

==== Cyber ====
The Bush administration in January 2008 initiated the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI). It introduced a differentiated approach, such as identifying existing and emerging cybersecurity threats, finding and plugging existing cyber vulnerabilities and apprehending those trying to access federal information systems.

President Obama said the &quot;cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation&quot; and that &quot;America&#x27;s economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity&quot;.

<text>Mindoro is the seventh largest and eighth-most populous island in the Philippines. With a total land area of 10,571 km2 ( 4,082 sq.mi ), it has a population of 1,408,454, as of the 2020 census. It is located off the southwestern coast of Luzon and northeast of Palawan. Mindoro is divided into two provinces: Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro. Calapan is the only city on the island, while San Jose is the largest settlement on the island with a total population of 143,430 inhabitants as of 2015. The southern coast of Mindoro forms the northeastern extremum of the Sulu Sea. Mount Halcon is the highest point on the island, standing at above sea level located in Oriental Mindoro. Mount Baco is the island&#x27;s second highest mountain with an elevation of , located in the province of Occidental Mindoro.

==Geography==
Mindoro is the seventh (7th) largest island in the Philippines. It is divided into the provinces of Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro. The Mindoro Mountain Range is the largest and longest mountain range in the island, with a total length of north-south and width east–west. Mount Halcon, at , is the island’s highest point and is located in Oriental Mindoro.

Mindoro is a center of biodiversity in the Philippines, a megadiverse country, and has a large number of species found nowhere else on the archipelago. Mindoro additionally hosts its own ecoregion, the Mindoro rain forests, separate from neighboring Luzon. Mindoro&#x27;s biodiversity and isolation is a result of the island not being connected to the rest of the Philippines during the Pleistocene; during this time, most of the Philippine islands were connected to each other during lower sea levels; however, the deeper channels surrounding Mindoro led to it being isolated from the rest of the Philippines during this time.

==Etymology==
The name Mindoro was likely a corruption of the native name &quot;Minolo.&quot; Domingo Navarette (&#x27;Tratados...&#x27;, 1676) wrote &quot;The island which the natives call Minolo is named Mindoro by the Spaniards...&quot; (trans. by Blair and Robertson).

==History==

In precolonial times, the island has been called &quot;Ma-i&quot; or &quot;Mait&quot; by Han Chinese traders. Indigenous groups are called Mangyans. The Spaniards called the place &quot;Mina de Oro&quot; (&quot;gold mine&quot;), from where the island derives the current form of its current name. According to the late historian William Henry Scott, an entry in the official history of the Song Dynasty for the year 972 mentions Ma-i as a state which traded with China. Other Chinese records referring to Ma-i or Mindoro appear in the following years.

The products that Mindoro traders exchanged with the Chinese included “beeswax, cotton, true pearls, tortoiseshell, medicinal betelnuts and &quot;yu-ta&quot; [jute?] cloth” for Chinese porcelain, trade gold, iron pots, lead, copper, colored glass beads and iron needles.

The island was invaded and conquered by the Sultanate of Brunei and housed Moro settlements before the Spanish invaded and Christianized the population. Afterward, the area was depopulated due to wars between the Spaniards and Moros from Mindanao who sought to enslave the Hispanized people and re-Islamize the island. Consequently, most of the population fled to nearby Batangas and the once-rich towns of Mindoro fell into ruin. In the seventeenth century, Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri visited the island.

By the end of the 1700s, Mindoro had 3,165 native families and four Spanish Filipino families. In 1898, Mindoro joined in the Philippine Revolution against Spain due to the influx of rebels settling into the island from Cavite and Bataan. Local patriotism died down however during the American occupation of the Philippines and the Japanese era.

The island was the location of the Battle of Mindoro in World War II.

Nevertheless, upon Philippine independence from the United States in 1946, the area recovered and from 1920 to 1950, the island was a single province with Calapan as the provincial capital. In 1950, it was partitioned into its present-day provinces, Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro, following a referendum.
==Economy==

The economy of Mindoro is largely based on agriculture. Products consist of a wide variety of fruits, such as citrus, bananas, lanzones, rambutan and coconuts, grains (rice and corn), sugarcane, peanuts, fish (catfish, milkfish and tilapia), livestock and poultry. Logging and the mining of marble and copper also thrive. Only 5% of the original forest remains as a result of extensive logging, prevalent agricultural practices, and population growth.

Tourism is a lucrative business as well, with locations such as Apo Reef National Park, Lubang Island, Puerto Galera, Sabang Beach and Mount Halcon. Puerto Galera&#x27;s beaches are the island&#x27;s most-known tourist attraction and are widely visited.

An important aspect of the economy in Mindoro is mining, mostly by outside companies owned by foreign countries. While the foreign countries make most of the money from these mines, the Philippine government still receives some economic and financial benefit from allowing them to mine on their lands. These companies include Pitkin Petroleum, a US-based company which is looking for nickel, oil, and gas in Mindoro, Crew Development Corporation, a Canada-based corporation mining nickel and other precious metals, and Intex, a Norwegian-based company operating the Mindoro Nickel Project. This project is supposed to last 15 years and should produce over 100 million tons of ore by the end of the project. Unfortunately, while the mines might be profitable for the national government, they have caused problems to the environment and the indigenous tribes living in Mindoro.

== Environment ==

Mining in Mindoro poses a significant risk to the island&#x27;s environment. Local and international mining interests have disregarded the island&#x27;s ecology to gain access to the rich tungsten veins that exist below the surface. Intex, a Norwegian Mining Company attempted to begin prospecting for tungsten deposits, but was halted by a regional environmental protection ordinance. Small scale, legal and illegal, environmentally degrading mining operations still persist throughout the island due to a lack of enforcement by the local police.

===Fauna===
Mindoro is also home to the tamaraw or Mindoro dwarf buffalo (&quot;Bubalus mindorensis&quot;), which is endemic to the island. The tamaraw is a bovine related to the water buffalo (carabao) and is an endangered species.

==Culture==
===Languages===
The principal language in Mindoro is Tagalog, often the Batangas dialect due to its geographical proximity to Batangas and Batangueño residents on the island (the reason for making Mindoro part of Southern Tagalog), with some parts more greatly influenced by the native Mangyan and Visayan languages also spoken on the island. The former is endemic to Mindoro and has dialects, while Ilocano, Bicolano, Hiligaynon, Karay-a, Cuyonon and some foreign languages – e.g., English, Hokkien (the predominant Chinese language of Chinese Filipinos), to a lesser extent, Spanish.

The following indigenous languages (all of them being part of the Philippine branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages family, like also like Ilocano, Bicolano, and the nationally designated Filipino) are spoken in Mindoro:
*Northern Mindoro languages – 16,000 speakers
**Iraya – 10,000 speakers
**Alangan – 2,150 speakers
**Tadyawan – 4,200 speakers
*Southern Mindoro languages – 30,000 speakers
**Buhid – 8,000 speakers
**Tawbuid – 8,000 speakers
**Hanuno&#x27;o – 14,000 speakers
*Visayan languages
**Ratagnon language – 310 speakers

===Religion===
The predominant religion on the island is Christianity. The religion of the indigenous Mangyan population is animism. Though they are into animism as a principal religion, the Catholic Church in some of Mindoro&#x27;s parts is also active, so are a few independent subdivisions, like Iglesia ni Cristo and Philippine Independent Church, as well as the Baptist Church.

<doc id="240483" wikidata="Q714989" url="?curid=240483" title="Battle of Britain (film)">
<text>Battle of Britain is a 1969 British war film documenting the events of the Battle of Britain, the war for aerial supremacy between the German Luftwaffe and the defending Royal Air Force waged over British skies during summer of 1940. The nature of the subject drew many respected British actors to accept roles as key figures of the battle, including Laurence Olivier as Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, Trevor Howard as Air Vice-Marshal Keith Park, and Patrick Wymark as Air Vice-Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory. Directed by Guy Hamilton and produced by Harry Saltzman and S. Benjamin Fisz, it also starred Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer, and Robert Shaw as Squadron Leaders. The script by James Kennaway and Wilfred Greatorex was based on the book &quot;The Narrow Margin&quot; by Derek Wood and Derek Dempster.

The film endeavoured to be a generally accurate account of the Battle of Britain, when in the summer and autumn of 1940 the British RAF inflicted a strategic defeat on the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and so ensured the cancellation of Operation Sea Lion, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s plan to invade Britain. The film is notable for its spectacular flying sequences. It was on a far larger scale than had been seen on film before, or since, making the film&#x27;s production very expensive.

==Plot==
The Battle of France rages in June 1940. It has turned against both the British and French. RAF pilots evacuate a small airfield in advance of German advance forces. The pilots, along with British and French military, leave just as Luftwaffe aircraft arrive and execute a heavy strafing attack. As the deserted beaches of Dunkirk are shown, where retreating British forces were overwhelmed and driven into the sea by the Wehrmacht, the BBC reports British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s declaration that &quot;what General Weygand called the &#x27;Battle of France&#x27; is over. The Battle of Britain is about to begin.&quot;

In neutral Switzerland, the German ambassador, Baron von Richter, proposes new peace terms to his British counterpart, Sir David Kelly, stating that with the fall of France and U.S. still determinedly isolationist continuing to fight alone is hopeless. Kelly retorts, &quot;Don&#x27;t threaten or dictate to us until you&#x27;re marching up Whitehall ... and even then we won&#x27;t listen.&quot; Hitler delays, hoping Britain will accept peace terms; British commanders use the delay to build up their strength, training pilots and ground controllers.

The campaign to conquer Britain by air begins with the German air force launching an early morning assault on &quot;Eagle Day&quot;. It seeks to destroy the RAF on the ground before it has time to launch its Spitfire and Hurricane fighters. Two British radar stations at Ventnor and Dover are put out of action and a number of RAF airfields are damaged or destroyed, but losses are relatively light. A grueling battle of attrition ensues, with airfields in Southern England under repeated attack.

Tensions develop between commanding officers of RAF 11 Group, Keith Park, and 12 Group, Trafford Leigh-Mallory. Leigh-Mallory is tasked with protecting 11 Group&#x27;s airfields while Park&#x27;s forces are aloft engaging the enemy, but in raid after raid 12 Group aircraft are nowhere to be seen. Called to meet Dowding, Leigh-Mallory explains that the &quot;Big Wing&quot; tactic he has devised to assemble an air armada to attack the Germans from above takes time to form up, while Park complains that it takes too long, and the tactic is simply not working.

The turning point in the Battle occurs when a squadron of German bombers lost in bad weather at night jettisons its bombs, which accidentally fall on London. In retaliation, the RAF attacks Berlin. Though the damage is negligible, an enraged Adolf Hitler publicly orders London to be razed. Hermann Göring arrives in France to personally command the assault, confident that the end of the campaign nears. Their first northbound sorties skirt the RAF, which is still defending its airfields to the south, and the Germans bomb unopposed. Night time attacks follow and London burns.

To supplement Commonwealth forces, the RAF has begun accepting and training foreign pilots who have escaped German-occupied countries. The main difficulty is their lack of English-language skills. While on a training flight, a Free Polish Air Force squadron accidentally runs into an unescorted flight of German bombers. Ignoring commands to avoid engagement by their British training officer, they peel off and shoot down several bombers with aggressive if unorthodox tactics. Park rewards the unit by elevating it to operational status, leading Dowding to do the same for the Canadian and Czech trainees.

While discussing the day&#x27;s events, Park and Dowding examine the German switch to London. Given a respite, Park notes that he will be able to repair his airfields and bring his squadrons back to near full strength. Dowding observes that although enemy bombers can reach London, their fighter escort can only provide ten minutes of cover. He concludes that &quot;turning on London could be the Germans&#x27; biggest blunder.&quot;

The next German daytime raid is met by large groups of RAF fighters attacking en masse, which overwhelm the German raiders. Luftwaffe losses are so severe an incensed Göring orders German fighters remain with the bombers. Deprived of both of altitude and speed, they are easy prey for British fighters attacking from above. For the first time German losses outweigh British.

The climactic air battle of 15 September 1940 arrives, with British ground control ordering every squadron into the air, leaving no reserve. Intense combat over London leaves both sides with heavy losses.

The next day the RAF anxiously await a raid that never comes. Both German air and naval forces withdraw from the coast, leaving airfields abandoned and harbors empty. Göring leaves the front, accusing his commanding commanders of betrayal. Dowding looks out over the gardens and up to the sky where the words of Winston Churchill appear onscreen: &quot;Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.&quot;

==Cast==
The &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; has a large all-star international cast. The film was notable for its attempt to accurately portray the role of the Germans, with participants in the battle including Group Captain Tom Gleave, Wing Commander Robert Stanford Tuck, Squadron Leader Bolesław Drobiński and Luftwaffe &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Adolf Galland involved as consultants. During the war, Drobiński had heavily damaged Galland&#x27;s plane and forced him into a crash-landing. Subtitled German-speaking actors were cast, a departure from other English language British films in the postwar period, where Germans were often played by Anglophone actors.

===Film proposal===
In mid-September 1965, Fisz, a former Hurricane pilot, saw aircraft practising for the Battle of Britain day, over Hyde Park, London. He saw how teenagers did not recognise the aircraft. In that same second, Fisz had a proposal for what became the film. Fisz raced to his office, and telephoned the film executive Freddy Thomas. Fisz asked Thomas if he had liked the film &#x27;The Longest Day&#x27;. Thomas said that &#x27;The Longest Day&#x27; had made much money. Fisz asked Thomas that if a similar film could be made about the Battle of Britain, that showed each side. Thomas said &#x27;It would depend upon what the script was like&#x27;.

In May 1966 Saltzmann telephoned Fisz, and asked about meeting over dinner that night. Fisz told Saltzmann that he could find £1.5m for the film, and that the film would cost around £3.5m. Saltzmann said that he could find the required money. Saltzmann approached Paramount, but that proposal never happened. By 1967 Fisz was receiving thousands of letters from around the world, about the proposed film, with many containing money. The film&#x27;s writers proposed to set up a fund.

===Script===
By the end of August 1967, a copy of the script was sent to Galland, to be &#x27;checked&#x27;. Galland claimed that the description of the bombing by the Germans of civilians in London was a &#x27;malicious distortion of the truth&#x27;. Oberst Hans Brustellin and Major Franz Frodel also advised. Former WAAF Squadron Officer Claire Legge, from East Sussex, gave the female military viewpoint. Claire had been at RAF Tangmere during the battle; her husband was Spitfire test pilot Jeffrey Quill.

=== Aircraft ===

The film required a large number of period aircraft. In September 1965 producers Harry Saltzman and S. Benjamin Fisz contacted former RAF Bomber Command Group Captain T.G. &#x27;Hamish&#x27; Mahaddie to find the aircraft and arrange their use. Eventually 100 aircraft were employed, called the &quot;35th largest air force in the world&quot;. With Mahaddie&#x27;s help, the producers located 109 Spitfires in the UK, of which 27 were available although only 12 could be made flyable. Mahaddie negotiated use of six Hawker Hurricanes, of which three were flying. The film helped preserve these aircraft, including a rare Spitfire Mk II which had been a gate guardian at RAF Colerne in Wiltshire.

During the actual aerial conflict, all RAF Spitfires were Rolls-Royce Merlin powered Spitfire Mk I and Mark II variants. However, only one Mk Ia and one Mk IIa (the latter with a Battle of Britain combat record) could be made airworthy, so the producers had to use seven other different marks, all of them built later in the war. To achieve commonality, the production made some modifications to &quot;standardise&quot; the Spitfires, including adding elliptical wingtips, period canopies and other changes.

A pair of two-seat trainer Spitfires were used as camera platforms to achieve realistic aerial combat footage. Lieutenant Maurice Hynett, RN, on leave from duties at Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, flew a number of Spitfire sequences in the film. A rare Hawker Hurricane XII had been restored by Canadian Bob Diemert, who flew the aircraft in the film. Eight non-flying Spitfires and two Hurricanes were set dressing, with one Hurricane able to taxi.

A North American B-25 Mitchell &quot;N6578D&quot;, flown by pilots John &quot;Jeff&quot; Hawke and Duane Egli, was the primary filming platform for the aerial sequences. It was fitted with camera positions in the aircraft&#x27;s nose, tail and waist gun positions. An additional camera, on an articulating arm, was mounted in the aircraft&#x27;s bomb bay and captured 360-degree shots from below the aircraft. The top gun turret was replaced with a clear dome for the aerial director, who would co-ordinate the other aircraft by radio.

&quot;N6578D&quot; was painted garishly for line-up references and to make it easier for pilots to determine which way it was manoeuvring.
As Luftwaffe stand-ins the producers obtained 32 CASA 2.111 twin-engined bombers, a Spanish-built, Merlin-powered version of the German Heinkel He 111H-16. They also located 27 Hispano Aviación HA-1112 M1L &#x27;Buchon&#x27;, a Spanish version of the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engine fighter. The Buchons were altered to better resemble Bf 109Es, with mock machine guns and cannon, redundant tailplane struts, and rounded wingtips removed, but nothing could be done about the Merlin-powered &quot;Buchon&#x27;s&quot; nose profile not resembling that of the &quot;inverted&quot; Daimler-Benz DB-601-driven Bf 109E&#x27;s.

After the film, one HA-1112 was donated to the German &quot;Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr&quot;, and converted to a Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-2 variant, depicting the insignias of German ace Gustav Rödel.

Two Heinkels and the 17 flyable Messerschmitts (including one dual-controlled HA-1112-M4L two-seater, used for conversion training and as a camera ship), were flown from Spain to England to complete the shoot. In the scene where the Polish training squadron breaks off to attack, the three most distant Hurricanes were Buchons marked as Hurricanes, as there were not enough flyable Hurricanes. In addition to the combat aircraft, two Spanish-built Junkers Ju 52 transports were used.

===Pilots===
Before filming, RAF Duxford was largely derelict. 10 RAF pilots were picked to fly aircraft, and over 800 had applied to take part in filming.
Pilots included
* Flt Lt David Curry, aged 29, of RAF Manby, originally from Worcester, England and lived in Maltby le Marsh in Lincolnshire, who flew a Hurricane; he had flown Canberras in Germany

The flying sequences were led by George Elliott DFC (born c. 1923). During the war, as a Spitfire pilot, Elliott was shot down in 1944 when strafing over Austria, and had taken three months to get back to England, through Yugoslavia. He had not taken part in the Battle of Britain. Aerial filming took place from April to November 1968. The summer of 1968 was not good for filming. The Board of Trade would not let any filming of aerial sequences, if filming was not by led a senior RAF officer, for the safety of other aircraft. Elliott described the aerial filming as &#x27;dangerous&#x27;.

There were 10 pilots flying German aircraft, led by Commandante Don Pedro Santa Cruz. The German cast were unhappy with the conduct of the four Texan pilots flying German aircraft. The Texans had supplied many historic aircraft, so had been allowed to fly in the film. The Texans appeared as Luftwaffe colonels. The four Texans walked about the set in their Luftwaffe senior officer uniforms, often giving people the &#x27;Heil Hitler&#x27; salute. One Texan, whilst in his Luftwaffe uniform, would sing Mexican love songs, with his guitar.

===Locations===
Filming in England was at Duxford, Debden, North Weald and Hawkinge, all operational stations in 1940; one surviving First World War &quot;Belfast&quot; hangar at Duxford was blown up for the &quot;Eagle Day&quot; sequence. Some filming also took place at Bovingdon, a former wartime bomber airfield. Some aerial shots were also taken over the former RAF Sywell (now Sywell Aerodrome in Northamptonshire). The title sequence scene, showing a review of German bombers on the ground by Fieldmarshal Milch, was filmed at Tablada aerodrome in Spain. Stunt coordinator Wilson Connie Edwards retained a Mark IX Spitfire, six Buchons, and a P-51 Mustang in lieu of payment, which were stored in Texas until sold to collectors in 2014.

The village of Chilham in Kent became the base of operations for the radio controllers in the film. Denton, another Kent village, and its pub, The Jackdaw Inn, features in the film as the location where Christopher Plummer and his on-screen wife argue about her relocating closer to his posting. The Jackdaw has a room devoted to an extensive collection of RAF Second World War memorabilia.

Many of the scenes in the film were filmed in Spain. Among these scenes was the Dunkirk recreation, which was shot at the beachfront in Huelva. To reflect the cloudless skies of summer of 1940, many upward-facing shots were filmed over Spain, while downward-facing shots were almost all below the clouds, over southern England, where farmland is distinctive. However, 1940 camouflage made it difficult to see the aircraft against the ground and sky, so a cloud background was used where possible. Only one Spitfire was relocated to Spain to stand in for the RAF defenders. After filming began, the English weather proved too unreliable and filming was moved to Hal Far and Luqa airfields in Malta to complete the aerial sequences.

Numerous scenes were shot in operations rooms preserved to illustrate the operation of the Dowding system that controlled the fighter squadrons. Much of this footage takes place in 11 Group&#x27;s operations room, today the Battle of Britain Bunker. Other scenes take place in Fighter Command&#x27;s central &quot;filter room&quot;, as well as recreations of the squadron ops rooms. One scene shows the hit on Biggin Hill&#x27;s ops room, and another shows its relocation to a local bakery, although this artistic license is a recreation of another squadron&#x27;s backup room in a local butcher&#x27;s shop.

Location filming in London was carried out mainly in the St Katharine Docks area - ironically one of the few areas of London&#x27;s East End to survive the Blitz relatively intact - where older houses being demolished for housing estates stood in for bombed dwellings and disused buildings were set on fire. Many extras were survivors of the Blitz. Aldwych tube station, used as a wartime air-raid shelter, served as a filming location. Almost all the period equipment from the London Fire Brigade Museum was used in the film. The night scenes of wartime Berlin were filmed in Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain. Production gaffers were allowed to blackout the city on demand, with health facilities and official buildings backed up with generators. The scenes at RAF Fighter Command were filmed at its headquarters, RAF Bentley Priory. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding&#x27;s original office, with its original furniture, was used.

===Aircraft models===
Permission was granted to the producers to use the Royal Air Force Museum&#x27;s Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive-bomber, one of only two that survive intact. The 1943 aircraft was repainted and slightly modified to resemble a 1940 model Ju 87. The engine was found to be in excellent condition and there was little difficulty in starting it, but returning the aircraft to airworthiness was ultimately too costly for the filmmakers. Instead, two Percival Proctor training aircraft were converted into half-scale &quot;Stukas&quot;, with a gull wing, as &quot;Proctukas&quot;, although the footage of them was not used. Instead, to duplicate the steep dive of Ju 87 attacks, large models were flown by radio control.

To recreate airfield scenes with the limited number of period aircraft available for the film, large-scale models were used. The first requirement was for set decoration replicas. Production of full-size wood and fibreglass Hurricanes, Spitfires and Bf 109s commenced in a sort of production line set up at Pinewood Studios. A number of the replicas were fitted with motorcycle engines to enable them to taxi. Although most of these replicas were destroyed during filming, a small number were made available to museums in the UK.

The other need was for models in aerial sequences, and art director and model maker John Siddall was asked by the producer to create and head a team specifically for this because of his contacts in the modelling community. A test flight was arranged at Lasham Airfield in Hampshire in the UK, and a model was flown down the runway close behind a large American estate car with a cameraman in the rear. This test worked, leading to many radio-controlled models being constructed in the band rehearsal room at Pinewood Studios. Over two years, 82 Spitfires, Hurricanes, Messerschmitts and He 111s were built.

===Releases===
==Historical accuracy==
Although some characters are merged, the film is generally faithful to events. Most historians doubt that Germany could realistically have won the Battle of Britain, given Britain&#x27;s superiority in aircraft production, its vast radar and surveillance infrastructure, the superior experience of its pilots, and the inherent advantage of fighting an air war over its home territory. While loss of pilots was an issue, Britain could supplement its ranks with experienced pilots who had fled Poland, France, Belgium, and other countries Germany had conquered, as well as pilots from the Dominions and volunteers from the United States. The German switch from attacking airfields to bombing cities was an effect, not a cause, of Germany&#x27;s failure, as Germany had proved unable to destroy the airfields and other air infrastructure.

The film includes a sequence which relates the events of 15 August 1940, when the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; attempted to overwhelm fighter defences by simultaneous attacks on northern and southern England, reasoning that &quot;even a Spitfire can&#x27;t be in two places at once&quot;. North East England was attacked by 65 Heinkel He 111s escorted by 34 Messerschmitt Bf 110s, and RAF Driffield was attacked by 50 unescorted Junkers Ju. 88s. Out of 115 bombers and 35 fighters sent, 16 bombers and seven fighters were lost. As a result of these casualties, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 5 did not appear in strength again in the campaign. 

The confrontation between Keith Park and Trafford Leigh-Mallory in front of Dowding is fictitious, though there undoubtedly were tensions between the two sides. The film does not mention that following the Battle of Britain Dowding and Park were replaced by Sholto Douglas and Leigh-Mallory, despite Dowding and Park having demonstrated that Leigh-Mallory&#x27;s &quot;Big Wing&quot; strategy was unworkable.

The scene in the operation room in which the British listen to their fighters&#x27; wireless transmissions relies on dramatic licence, as the operations room received information by telephone from the sector airfields. The scenes at the end in which the RAF pilots are seen suddenly idle and left awaiting the return of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; raids similarly rely on licence, as the fighting fizzled out through late September, although daylight raids continued for some weeks after the 15 September engagement, and the British regard 31 October 1940 as the official end of the Battle of Britain. In the film&#x27;s combat scenes, there was no attempt to recreate tracer rounds. Göring&#x27;s train in the film is Spanish rather than French (the Renfe - Spanish National Railways - markings are just visible on its tender), and the steam locomotive shown did not come into service on Renfe until 1951.

The film does not make reference to the Italian pilots from &quot;Corpo Aereo Italiano&quot;, an Italian expeditionary force, that fought in the Battle of Britain, nor does the list of participants and casualties that is part of the end credits. Although the State of Israel was not created until 1948, the list attributes one pilot to it, referring to RAF officer George Goodman, an ace born in Haifa during the Palestinian Mandate (when the region was under British administration), who was killed in action in 1941.

Reported German losses during the battle derive from claims made and believed at the time, but subsequent research has shown that these were substantial overestimates, as a result of issues such as multiple claims on the same downed aircraft. The actual number of German losses on 15 September, for example, was 56.

Pilot Officer Archie, played by Edward Fox, is based on Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron RAF. On 15 September 1940, now known as Battle of Britain Day, Holmes used his Hawker Hurricane to destroy a Dornier Do 17 bomber over London by ramming but at the cost of his aircraft (and almost his own life). Holmes, making a head-on attack, found his guns inoperative, and flew his plane into the top-side of the German bomber, cutting off the rear tail section with his wing and causing the bomber to dive out of control and crash. The Dornier pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, bailed out, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack, while the injured Holmes bailed out of his plane and survived. As the RAF did not practise ramming as an air combat tactic, this was considered an impromptu manoeuvre and an act of selfless courage; Holmes was feted by the press as a war hero who saved Buckingham Palace. This event became one of the defining moments of the Battle of Britain and elicited a congratulatory note to the RAF from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who had witnessed the crash. The film does not depict the plane ramming into the bomber&#x27;s tail section, showing rather Pilot Officer Archie simply shot down the fighter.

Skipper, played by Robert Shaw, is based loosely on Squadron Leader Adolph &#x27;Sailor&#x27; Malan, a South African fighter ace and No. 74 Squadron RAF commander during the Battle of Britain. Section Officer Maggie Harvey, played by Susannah York, is based on Felicity Peake, a young section officer at Biggin Hill in 1940. Her reaction to the heavy raid that resulted in the deaths of several Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF)s and confrontation with Warrant Officer Warwick were based on real events.

An RAF officer pilot with a disfigured face appears in a scene with Kenneth More and Susannah York. He is not an actor, but retired Squadron Leader Bill Foxley, a trainee navigator with RAF Bomber Command during World War II who suffered severe burns following a crash. He was notable for the support he gave to other burn victims and for this film appearance, which gave a wide audience some awareness of the facial burns suffered by World War II aircrews and the reconstructive surgery of that era.

The character of Major Falke is based on &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Adolf Galland, a famous ace during the Second World War who actually did ask &quot;Reichsmarshall&quot; Göring for &quot;an outfit of Spitfires for my squadron&quot;. In his autobiography, Galland explained that the request was only meant to upset Göring because he was &quot;unbelievably vexed at the lack of understanding and stubbornness with the command who gave us orders we could not execute&quot;, and that, while he felt the Spitfire was more manoeuvrable than the Bf 109, and therefore more suitable as a defensive fighter, &quot;fundamentally I preferred the Bf 109&quot;. Galland served as a German technical adviser on the film, and he was joined by his friend Robert Stanford Tuck. He was upset about the director&#x27;s decision not to use his real name and, during filming, took exception to a scene in which Kesselring is shown giving the Nazi salute, rather than the standard military salute; journalist Leonard Mosley witnessed Galland spoil a shot and have to be escorted off the set. Subsequently, Galland threatened to withdraw from the production, warning of &quot;dire consequences for the film if the scene stayed in&quot;. When the finished scene was screened before Galland and his lawyer, he was persuaded to accept it after all.

==Musical score==
Battle of Britain has two musical scores. The first was written by Sir William Walton, then in his late 60s, and conducted by Malcolm Arnold, who also assisted Walton with the orchestration—notably of the music accompanying the Blitz sequences and some sections of &quot;Battle in the Air&quot;, which may have also involved some compositional &quot;patches&quot; by Arnold. Aside from the undoubted originality and impact of the &quot;Battle in the Air&quot; sequence, and an opening march (conducted at the sessions by Walton) which was described by a journalist present at its recording as &quot;a grand patriotic tune to out-type and out-glory any that Sir William has yet written, whether for films or coronations&quot;, much of Walton&#x27;s score involves parodies of the horncall from Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried&quot;.

After the recording sessions, Arnold and David Picker, the uncle and nephew in charge of United Artists, insisted on having the music tracks sent to them in New York, and their verdict on hearing the music, unaccompanied by the film, was that it was unsuitable and a composer known to them should be hired to write a replacement score. The music department at United Artists also objected that the score was too short to fill the LP recording that was intended to be marketed with the film, so John Barry, who had scored several James Bond films, was approached, but he declined. The job of re-scoring the film was eventually offered to and accepted by Ron Goodwin, who also served as conductor.

In 2004, both Ron Goodwin&#x27;s and Sir William Walton&#x27;s scores were released on a single CD for the first time. Goodwin&#x27;s music occupied tracks 1 to 19, while Walton&#x27;s occupied tracks 20 to 28.
==Reception==
===Box office===
In its first two days playing in 11 cities in the UK, the film grossed $56,242. It was the number one film in the United Kingdom for a total of 14 weeks, during periods beginning on 26 September 1969 (4 weeks), 7 November 1969 (7 weeks), 6 February 1970 (2 weeks), and 27 February 1970 (1 week). According to director Guy Hamilton in an interview included on the two-disc DVD release of the film, &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; grossed just under $13 million at the global box office. Due to its high production and marketing costs, that meant a loss of $10 million, but the film eventually became profitable thanks to home media sales.

===Critical reviews===
In the United Kingdom, filming of the aerial battle scenes over London and the home counties generated considerable interest. Pre-release publicity included the film&#x27;s quad posters on prominent billboard locations and features in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; magazine and local press. However, the film was released at a time when anti-war feeling stirred by the Vietnam War was running high, and there was also cynicism among post-war generations about the supposed heroism of those who participated in the Battle of Britain. The film&#x27;s premiere was held at the Dominion Theatre in London on 15 September 1969 and was attended by 350 Battle of Britain veterans, including Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding.

The film received mixed reviews in the UK and was not received well by American critics. in Britain, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; called it &quot;an absorbing rather than a stirring film&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that it was &quot;a discreet mixture of all possible approaches, tastefully done, not unintelligent, eminently respectable, and for the most part deadly dull&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;neither a very good movie nor a very formidable piece of history&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film is an &quot;homage to those airmen who, in 1940, broke the back of the threatened Nazi invasion. It is also one of those all-star non-movies, of a somewhat lower order than &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, that attempt to recapitulate history, but add nothing to one&#x27;s understanding. The mixture of minor-key fiction and restaged fact is – for me, anyway – never particularly satisfying, since it is denied the prerogatives and possibilities of both the documentary and the fiction film.&quot;

In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Gene Siskel stated: &quot;We believe American film audiences are no longer impressed by casts of thousands and budgets of millions. Unfortunately, Harry Saltzman, who produced &quot;The Battle of Britain&quot;, disagrees. The film is a 12-thousand-megadollar bomb that features 100 vintage planes eating up 40 minutes of film. The film has absolutely no dramatic interest in the other 93 minutes, and I challenge the notion that it is worth seeing just for the aerial sequences.&quot; Siskel later placed the film on his list of the twenty worst films of 1969, remarking that &quot;the planes had the only good lines in the film.&quot; Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;the aerial scenes are allowed to run forever and repeat themselves shamelessly, until we&#x27;re sure we saw that same Heinkel dive into the sea (sorry – the &quot;drink&quot;) three times already. And the special effects aren&#x27;t all that good for a movie that cost $12,000,000.&quot; On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 9 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10.

==Merchandise==
* Both a hardcover and paperback book on the making of the film were published in 1969.
* A set of 66 bubble-gum collector cards to accompany the film was produced by Spitfire Productions.
* Dinky Toys produced a pair of diecast model aircraft based on the film. A Spitfire Mk II (Dinky Toys 719) in 1/65 scale and a Junkers Ju 87B Stuka (Dinky Toys 721) in 1/72 scale were released in special boxes with a &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; logo on the box and photographs from the film included.

==In popular culture==
* The fact that &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; used real aircraft in many of its flying sequences has led a number of subsequent productions to utilise stock footage derived from the film. These productions include the films &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall&quot; (1973), &quot;Carry On England&quot; (1976), &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; (television series, 1976-8), &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (1987), &quot;Piece of Cake&quot; (ITV miniseries, 1988), &quot;No Bananas&quot; (BBC miniseries, 1996), &quot;Dark Blue World&quot; (2001), and &quot;First Light&quot; (BBC TV movie, 2010), as well as the History Channel documentary &quot;The Extraordinary Mr Spitfire&quot; (2007), which is about the life of wartime test pilot Alex Henshaw.
* The formative strategy war-game &quot;Empire&quot; (1977) was notably inspired by the RAF Fighter Command scenes in &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;, during which staff move counters representing friendly and enemy aircraft and ships over a large map of Britain to help the air commanders make their tactical decisions.
* A fragment from the soundtrack of one of the dogfights in the film is used on the album &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979) by Pink Floyd, immediately before the start of the track &quot;Vera&quot;.
* Footage from the film of Bf 109s exploding and crashing into the English Channel was inserted into the &quot;Skeet Surfing&quot; music video that opens the parody film &quot;Top Secret!&quot; (1984).
* In the film &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017), Michael Caine has a spoken cameo role as a Royal Air Force Spitfire pilot as a nod to his role of RAF fighter pilot Squadron Leader Canfield in &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;.

<doc id="240489" wikidata="Q644781" url="?curid=240489" title="Gekiganger III">
<text>is an anime series within the anime series &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; that plays a critical part in the plot thereof. Gekiganger III was designed to mimic 1970s Super Robots, especially &quot;Getter Robo&quot;. Initially, only Gai Daigoji and Akito Tenkawa are depicted as enjoying the series. Later in the series, Hikaru Amano becomes the other resident anime fanatic, and towards the end of the series everyone on the ship learns to love the series.

==Story==
&quot;Gekiganger III&quot; exists only as brief clips within &quot;Nadesico&quot;, but a basic storyline can nonetheless be determined. As seen in the OVA, the story began with Professor Kokubunji (a character similar to the professors seen in other Super Robot series, such as Professor Saotome of &quot;Getter Robo&quot;) discovering cave paintings somewhere underground placed by the &quot;Super Paleolithic people&quot;. The paintings predicted that the Kyo&#x27;akk Empire would invade the Earth, and provided plans for a super robot, Gekiganger III.

Other clips seen throughout &quot;Nadesico&quot; establish the characters and setting. The main characters, and pilots of the titular robot, are Tenku Ken (A reference to Voltes V&#x27;s sword name), Umitsubame Joe, and Daichi Akira. The characters are similar in appearance and personality to the Getter Team from &quot;Getter Robo&quot;, as well as having counterparts in &quot;Nadesico&quot; itself (most prominently Gai and the Jovian robot pilots).

Also similar to &quot;Getter&quot; is the Gekiganger robot, which is made up of three machines: the Gekiga Jet, piloted by Ken; the Gekiga Marine, piloted by Joe; and the Gekiga Tank, piloted by Akira. The names of the machines are similar to three of the component parts of Combattler V, bringing another 70s mecha anime into the influence on the series.

Like &quot;Getter&quot;, the machines assemble in three different ways to form three robots: Gekiganger III is formed with &quot;Jet&quot; as the head and torso, &quot;Marine&quot; as its waist and upper legs, and &quot;Tank&quot; as its lower legs, and is similar to &quot;Getter 1&quot; in its preference for air combat. Umiganger is formed with &quot;Marine&quot; as the head and torso, &quot;Tank&quot; as the waist and &quot;Jet&quot; as the legs, and is the fastest, but weakest, form of Gekiganger. Finally, Rikuganger is formed with &quot;Tank&quot; as the head and torso, &quot;Jet&quot; as the waist and &quot;Marine&quot; as the legs, and is slow but has great brute strength. These last two, however, switch their best areas of battle from &quot;Getter Robo&quot;: Umiganger works best underwater and Rikuganger works more on land, whereas Getter 2 was the land-based robot and Getter 3 was for water in that series.

The villains of &quot;Gekiganger&quot; are the Kyo&#x27;akk Empire, an alien race from the &quot;Dark String Universe&quot; (a galaxy shaped like the infinity symbol). They are led by the Emperor Hyperion, and under him Prince Akara. Throughout &quot;Nadesico&quot; we see that Akara sends out many &quot;mecha-monsters&quot; to fight Gekiganger.

There are only a few major plot advancements that occur in &quot;Gekiganger&quot;, many of which are actually shown out of order in &quot;Nadesico&quot;. In one clip, a new character, Cowboy Johnny is introduced. He is from America, and pilots the &quot;Texas Robo&quot; machine, an obvious parody of Jack King and the &quot;Texas Mack&quot; from &quot;Getter Robo&quot;. Another clip features the death of Akara&#x27;s sidekick, Mii-e Mii-e who was in love with the oblivious prince. Akara himself is killed later after infiltrating a highschool finding to his shock that humans are capable of emotions.

By far the most important plot moment in &quot;Gekiganger&quot; is the death of Joe, at the hands of Prince Akara&#x27;s replacement, General Masaka. In &quot;Nadesico&quot;, seeing this scene is a major bonding moment between Akito and Gai, and it is seen and heard several times in the first few episodes.

The characters continue to watch &quot;Gekiganger&quot; past this point, though not much is known about the remainder of the series. Joe is replaced by a new character, Ryuuzaki Tetsuya, and the Gekiganger III is replaced by Gekiganger V. (Like &quot;Combattler V&quot;, the V is pronounced as the letter V; the English dub, however, referred to it as &quot;Gekiganger 5&quot;). Eventually, it is seen that Masaka is defeated. The final episode features a battle between the Gekiganger V (upgraded into &quot;Spaceganger&quot;) and Emperor Hyperion, which Gekiganger is losing until the original Gekiganger III appears, piloted by Joe. With a final Super Passion Slash and Double Gekigan Fire, Hyperion is defeated. However, by this point most of the &quot;Nadesico&quot; characters have given up their fanaticism over Gekiganger; several characters criticize the ending.

==OVA==
The &quot;Gekiganger III&quot; OVA, &quot;Hot-Blooded Great Battle!&quot; includes all clips of &quot;Gekiganger&quot; shown in &quot;Nadesico&quot;, a few never-before-seen clips, and a new &quot;movie&quot; featuring a battle between Gekiganger III and the Super Paleolithic people who designed it. Akara is also seen here, but later allies himself with the heroes against their common enemy. The opening mimics that of Mazinger Z vs. The Great General of Darkness, showing pictures of Gekiganger III that children drew, and involves a similar plotline to that movie as well.

==Gekiganger within Nadesico==

As &quot;Nadesico&quot; progresses, we find that the very reason the Jovians (who are really humans) are attacking Earth is because they believe their cause to be just and that their path is the only true righteous one as they idolize the Gekiganger anime series. Toward the end, even Captain Yurika Misumaru is a Gekiganger otaku. In the end, the Gekiganger series becomes a lesson on why people should not be narrow minded and think that their point of view is that of everyone else. That their moral code is the only one. A lot of violence and death occurs as a result of the Jovian&#x27;s adaptation of this point of view into their society and their leader&#x27;s attempts to preserve this adapted moral code.

Episode 14 of &quot;Nadesico&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s go with hot-blooded anime&quot;, is both a recap episode for that series and an episode of &quot;Gekiganger III&quot;. In that episode, the characters from &quot;Gekiganger&quot; watch &quot;Nadesico&quot;&#x27;s recap episode and comment on it at times. Both the heroes and villains of &quot;Gekiganger&quot; draw inspiration from &quot;Nadesico&quot; for their new technologies, with Prince Akara copying the Nadesico&#x27;s distortion field and Professor Kokubunji countering it with the Gekigan Flare, which he later admits was inspired by &quot;Nadesico&quot;. At the end of the episode, the &quot;Nadesico&quot; crew is seen watching the &quot;Gekiganger&quot; episode. Despite the continuity paradoxes this relationship causes, this episode is apparently canon to &quot;Gekiganger&quot;, if not to &quot;Nadesico&quot;, as Akara uses the distortion field again in the movie. The comments made by Ruri Hoshino in regards to the story and how the next episode will get back on track with it at the end of the episode along with the fact that the placing of the episode seems odd giving the events in the episodes before and after episode 14. seem to suggest the Nadesico episode being non-canon at the very least.

<doc id="240490" wikidata="Q1051445" url="?curid=240490" title="Cauda equina">
<text>The cauda equina () is a bundle of spinal nerves and spinal nerve rootlets, consisting of the second through fifth lumbar nerve pairs, the first through fifth sacral nerve pairs, and the coccygeal nerve, all of which arise from the lumbar enlargement and the conus medullaris of the spinal cord. The cauda equina occupies the lumbar cistern, a subarachnoid space inferior to the conus medullaris. The nerves that compose the cauda equina innervate the pelvic organs and lower limbs to include motor innervation of the hips, knees, ankles, feet, internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter. In addition, the cauda equina extends to sensory innervation of the perineum and, partially, parasympathetic innervation of the bladder.

==Structure==
In adulthood, the cauda equina is made of lumbosacral spinal nerve roots.

===Development===
In humans, the spinal cord stops growing in infancy. At birth the end of the spinal cord is about the level of the third lumbar vertebra, or L3. Because the bones of the vertebral column continue to grow, by about 12 months of age the end of the cord reaches its permanent position. Typically this is at the level of L1 or L2 (closer to the head), ranging due to normal anatomical variations anywhere from the twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12) to L3. Individual spinal nerve roots arise from the cord as they get closer to the head, but as the differential growth occurs, the top end of the nerve stays attached to the spinal cord while the lower end of the nerve exits the spinal column at its proper level. This results in a &quot;bundle&quot;-like structure of nerve fibers that extends caudally, within the spinal column, from the end of the spinal cord, gradually declining in number further down as individual pairs leave the spinal column.

==Clinical significance==

=== Needle insertion ===
The cauda equina exists within the lumbar cistern, a gap between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater of the spinal cord, called the subarachnoid space. Cerebrospinal fluid also exists within this space. Because the spinal cord terminates at level L1/L2, lumbar puncture (or colloquially, &quot;spinal tap&quot;) is performed from the lumbar cistern between two vertebrae at level L3/L4, or L4/L5, where there is no risk of accidental injury to the spinal cord, when a sample of CSF is needed for clinical purposes.

=== Cauda equina syndrome ===
Cauda equina syndrome, a rare disorder affecting the bundle of nerve roots (cauda equina) at the lower (lumbar) end of the spinal cord, is a surgical emergency. Cauda equina syndrome occurs when the nerve roots in the lumbar spine are compressed, disrupting sensation and movement. Nerve roots that control the function of the bladder and bowel are especially vulnerable to damage. It can lead to permanent paralysis, impaired bladder and/or bowel control, loss of sexual sensation, and other problems if left untreated. Even with immediate treatment, some patients may not recover complete function.

Cauda equina syndrome most commonly results from a massive disc herniation in the lumbar region. A disc herniation occurs when one of the soft flexible discs that functions as an elastic shock absorber between the bones of the spinal column displaces from its normal position. The herniation occurs after the disc begins to break down with aging and can be precipitated by stress or a mechanical problem in the spine. The result is that the softer, center portion of the disc pushes out and causes pressure on the nerve roots in the lumbar spine. Other causes include spinal lesions and tumors, spinal infections or inflammation, lumbar spinal stenosis, trauma to the lower back, birth abnormalities, spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), spinal hemorrhages (subarachnoid, subdural, epidural), narrowing of the spinal canal, postoperative lumbar spine surgery complications or spinal anesthesia. Cauda equina syndrome can often be mistaken for conditions such as spinal stenosis, herniated discs and nerve root compression.

=== Radiculopathy ===
The cauda equina is vulnerable to being compressed, causing a radiculopathy.

==History==
The cauda equina was named after its resemblance to a horse&#x27;s tail () by the French anatomist Andreas Lazarus (André du Laurens) in the 17th century.

<doc id="240494" wikidata="Q689123" url="?curid=240494" title="Convoy PQ 17">
<text>Convoy PQ 17 was an Allied Arctic convoy during the Second World War. On 27 June 1942, the ships sailed from Hvalfjörður, Iceland, for the port of Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union. The convoy was located by German forces on 1 July, shadowed and attacked. 

The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, acting on information that German ships, including , were moving to intercept, ordered the covering force, based on the Allied battleships and away from the convoy and told the convoy to scatter. Because of vacillation by &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW, German armed forces high command), the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; raid never materialised. The convoy was the first large joint Anglo-American naval operation under British command; in Churchill&#x27;s view this encouraged a more careful approach to fleet movements.

As the close escort and the covering cruiser forces withdrew westwards to intercept the German raiders, the merchant ships were left without escorts. The freighters were attacked by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft and U-boats and of the 35 ships, only eleven reached their destination, delivering of cargo. The convoy disaster demonstrated the difficulty of passing adequate supplies through the Arctic, especially during the summer, with the midnight sun. The German success was possible through German signals intelligence and cryptological analysis.

==Background==
During Operation Barbarossa, the German war against the USSR, the British and American governments agreed to send unconditional aid to their Soviet ally. The Beaverbrook–Harriman Anglo-American Mission visited Moscow in October 1941, agreeing to a series of munitions deliveries to the Soviet Union. The most direct way to carry these supplies was by sea around the North Cape, through Arctic waters to the ports of Murmansk and Arkhangelsk. The agreement stated that the Soviet government was responsible for receiving the supplies in Soviet ships at British or American ports. Since the Soviets did not have enough ships for the quantities of aid, British and American ships began to constitute an increasing proportion of the convoy traffic. Although the defence of the Arctic convoys was the responsibility of the Royal Navy, the American Admiral Ernest King assigned Task Force 39 (TF 39) – based on the carrier and the battleship – to support the British.

The first convoy, Operation Dervish, sailed from the United Kingdom in August 1941, two months after the beginning of Barbarossa. By the spring of 1942, twelve more convoys had made the passage with the loss of only one of the 103 ships. The threat of attacks on the convoys increased, with the Germans making a maximum effort to stop the flow of supplies to the USSR. In 1941, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; had begun concentrating its strength in Norway in winter, to prevent a British invasion of Norway and to obstruct Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. The battleship was moved to Trondheim in January, where she was joined by the heavy cruiser and in March by the heavy cruiser . The battleships , and the heavy cruiser were also sent to Arctic waters but fell victim to Allied air attacks and had to turn back for repairs. The Germans had bases along the Norwegian coast, which meant, until escort carriers became available, Allied convoys had to be sailed through these areas without adequate defence against aircraft and submarine attack.

==British plan==
British naval intelligence in June reported &quot;Unternehmen Rösselsprung&quot; (Operation Knight&#x27;s Move), the German plan to use their big ships to attack the next convoy, east of Bear Island. German forces would operate close to the Norwegian coast, with support of shore-based air reconnaissance and striking forces, with a screen of U-boats in the channels between Svalbard and Norway. Allied covering forces would be without air support, from their base and with the destroyers too short on fuel to escort a damaged ship to harbour.

The Admiralty issued instructions on 27 June, which allowed the convoy to be turned back, temporarily to shorten the distance to the nearest Allied base. German surface movements took place later than expected, making these instructions unnecessary. The Admiralty also stated that the safety of the convoy from surface attack westward of Bear Island depended on Allied surface forces, while to the eastward it was to be provided by Allied submarines. The convoy&#x27;s cruiser covering force was not to go east of Bear Island, unless the convoy was threatened by the presence of a surface force which the cruiser force could fight, nor to go beyond 25° East under any circumstances.

A decoy convoy was also organised to divert enemy forces, consisting of the First Minelaying Squadron and four colliers, escorted by the light cruisers and , five destroyers and several trawlers. This diversionary force assembled at Scapa Flow for a week, sailing two days after the convoy. German reconnaissance of Scapa during the period of assembly failed to notice the diversion, which was also not sighted on its passage. The operation was repeated on 1 July, again without success. On 26 June the Admiralty took the opportunity to pass the westbound Convoy QP 13, in conjunction with Convoy PQ 17. The former was made up of returning merchant ships from Arkhangelsk, with some ships from Murmansk. It consisted of thirty-five ships and was escorted by five destroyers, three corvettes, an anti-aircraft ship, three minesweepers, two trawlers and to the Bear Island area, a submarine. It was sighted by German aircraft on 30 June and 2 July. Convoy QP 13 was not attacked, since the German tactic was to concentrate on eastbound (laden) convoys, rather than westbound convoys in ballast.

A fresh ice reconnaissance done on 3 July found the passage north of Bear Island had widened. The Admiralty suggested the convoy should pass at least north of it. The senior officer of the escort (SOE), Commander Jack Broome, preferred to stay in the low visibility on the original route and to make ground to the eastward. Rear Admiral Louis Hamilton, in command of the cruiser squadron, later decided that a more northerly route was necessary, ordered the SOE to alter course, to pass north of Bear Island and later on to open to from Banak.

==Covering forces==

The convoy&#x27;s close escort was the First Escort Group (EG1, SOE Jack Broome) and included the anti-aircraft auxiliary cruisers and HMS &quot;Pozarica&quot;, the destroyers , , , , and , the corvettes, minesweepers or armed trawlers , , and , the s , &quot;Salamander&quot; and and the anti-submarine trawlers , &quot;Lord Austin&quot;, &quot;Ayrshire&quot; and &quot;Northern Gem&quot;. Distant cover came from the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS1, Hamilton), consisting of the British cruisers (flagship) and , the American cruisers and and four destroyers, two from the United States Navy. As further protection, Home Fleet battleships cruised at about distance.

A second heavy covering force, under the command of Admiral John Tovey, was made up of the aircraft carrier , the battleship (flagship), the cruisers and , the US battleship &quot;Washington&quot; and nine destroyers. As the convoy sailed, the covering forces were moving into position. CS1 left Seidisfjord in the night of 30 June/1 July. It arrived in a covering position north of the convoy on 2 July. The cruisers were not sighted by the Germans until late on 3 July. The heavy covering force was shadowed for a short period while north-east of Iceland on 1 July, while the cruiser screen was refuelling at Seidisfjord. It was shadowed for a short period early on 3 July, while in a covering position south of the convoy. 

Later that day, course was altered northwards to cross the convoy&#x27;s track and to reach a position north-west of Bear Island. This would place &quot;Victorious&quot; within air striking range of the convoy on the morning of 4 July. This was calculated to occur at the same time at which a surface attack was expected. While en route to the new covering area, the force was joined by and from Spitzbergen. Air reconnaissance of Norwegian harbours had been hindered by weather but information showed German heavy units were probably moving northwards and an air photograph of Trondheim late on 3 July showed that &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and &quot;Hipper&quot; were absent. The flying boat patrol and the two lines of submarines between North Cape and Bear Island were adjusted to cover the line of approach to the convoy as it moved eastwards. In view of the uncertainty of the two German ships&#x27; positions, Hamilton decided to continue to provide close cover with the cruiser squadron and to pass east of Bear Island.

==German forces==
Against Convoy PQ 17 the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; prepared wolfpack (Ice Devil), to intercept the convoy; three U-boats were in a patrol line north of the Denmark Strait to give advance warning and another five further north of Jan Mayen Island. The also had two battle groups in Norwegian ports, Force I () consisting of the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, the cruiser &quot;Hipper&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Karl Galster&quot;, &quot;Friedrich Ihn&quot;, &quot;Hans Lody&quot;, &quot;Theodor Riedel&quot; with the torpedo boats T 7 and T 15. Force II () &quot;Lützow&quot;, &quot;Scheer&quot; and the destroyers , , , and , ready to carry out a surface attack on the convoy. This was orchestrated as a complex two-stage operation codenamed (Operation Knight&#x27;s Move); the force was the strongest yet assembled for a convoy attack but was hampered by an unwieldy chain of command, with the authority to attack resting with Hitler and a contradictory mission statement; the forces were instructed to attack and destroy the convoy and also to avoid any action that would lead to damage to the capital ships, particularly &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. On 16 June, the cruisers &quot;Lützow&quot; and &quot;Scheer&quot; took part in a joint naval and air exercise simulating an attack on Convoy PQ 17 and its escort.
These forces were supported by aircraft of , which had to contend with the growth of the Soviet Air Force at the terminus of the Arctic sea route. During Convoy PQ 16, German attacks faded away during 27 May due to the arrival of Soviet destroyers and the arrival of Soviet bombers overhead; when the convoy came into range on 29 May, Soviet fighters began escort sorties. The rise on the number of opposing aircraft led to Germans claiming 162 aircraft shot down in May, 113 being Hurricanes provided from Britain. On 28 May the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; claimed 22 aircraft for no loss. The German claims were exaggerated but the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; airfields at Petsamo, Kirkenes and Banak began to receive frequent attacks by Soviet bombers and fighters, often timed to ground the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during convoys. On 29 May, the Soviets tried to jam &quot;Luftflotte 5&quot; wireless frequencies and raided Kirkenes with small formations of aircraft or solo attacks. The Soviet raids stretched the resources of &quot;Luftflotte 5&quot; and increased losses on raids against Murmansk.

No convoys were spotted during June and the weather was too bad for convoy operations. Training in the (Golden Comb) tactic, first used against Convoy PQ 16, continued. By early June there were 264 aircraft available, a strike force of 103 Ju 88 bombers, 42 He 111 torpedo-bombers and 30 Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers, eight FW 200 Kondor and 22 Ju 88s for long-range reconnaissance, 44 Bv 138 flying boats for shorter-range reconnaissance and fifteen He 115 floatplanes for general use. Many of the torpedo-bombers had been hurriedly transferred from other theatres and retrained from conventional bombing, as part of Hitler&#x27;s demand for greater action against the Arctic convoys.

==Voyage==
The convoy sailed from Hvalfjord on 27 June, under the command of the convoy commodore, John Dowding. With the 34 merchant ships, an oiler () for the escort, and three rescue ships (&quot;Rathlin&quot;, &quot;Zamalek&quot;, and &quot;Zaafaran&quot;) sailed with the convoy. The escort was made up of six destroyers, four corvettes, three minesweepers, four trawlers, two anti-aircraft ships and two submarines. The route was longer than earlier convoys, since the ice allowed for a passage north of Bear Island and an evasive detour in the Barents Sea. All the convoy was bound for Arkhangelsk, because recent air attacks had destroyed most of Murmansk. One ship suffered mechanical failure just out of port and was forced to turn back. SS &quot;Exford&quot;, turned back after sustaining ice damage.

Part of the convoy ran into drifting ice in thick weather whilst in the Denmark Strait. Two merchant ships were damaged and had to turn back; &quot;Grey Ranger&quot; was also damaged and her speed reduced to . Since it was doubtful if she could face heavy weather, it was decided to transfer her to the fuelling position north-east of Jan Mayen in exchange for the . Shortly after it sailed, Convoy PQ 17 was sighted and tracked by &quot;U-456&quot; and shadowed continuously, except for a few short intervals in fog. This was augmented by BV 138 flying boats on 1 July. On 2 July, the convoy sighted the reciprocal Convoy QP 13. Convoy PQ 17 was attacked by nine torpedo aircraft, later the same day; one aircraft was shot down. At 13:00 on 3 July, the Convoy PQ 17 destroyer screen was steering east to pass between Bear Island and Spitsbergen.

On the morning of 4 July, a Heinkel He 115, from Küstenfliegergruppe 906, hit the Liberty ship , around north-east of Bear Island, at . The submarine HMS &quot;P-614&quot; attempted to scuttle her but she remained afloat; sank the ship at 08:08. There was an abortive attack by six bombers in the evening. broke up an air attack on the convoy the same day. Later that evening, an attack by 25 torpedo bombers took place, sinking .

== Dispersal ==
At 12:30 on 4 July, the Admiralty gave Hamilton permission to proceed east of 25° east, should the situation demand, unless contrary orders were received from Tovey. This was a reversal of previous orders and as no information in Tovey&#x27;s possession justified this change, Hamilton was ordered to withdraw when the convoy was east of 25° east or earlier at his discretion, unless the Admiralty assured him &quot;Tirpitz&quot; would not be met. At 18:58 the Admiralty informed Hamilton that more information was expected shortly, instructing him to remain with the convoy pending further instructions. At 21:11, the Admiralty sent a message prefixed &quot;Most Immediate&quot; ordering Hamilton to withdraw westwards at high speed. This was due to U-boat information, a fact not shared with Hamilton. At 21:23, the Admiralty, in a message prefixed &quot;Immediate&quot;, ordered the convoy to disperse and proceed to Russian ports independently owing to threat from surface ships. At 21:36, the Admiralty sent another &quot;Most Immediate&quot; message, ordering the convoy to scatter.

Hamilton, Broome and Dowding took these signals to indicate that an attack by &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was imminent. The convoy was immediately ordered to scatter, with the escorting destroyers ordered to join the cruiser force and the merchantmen to proceed independently. Winston Churchill later speculated that the Admiralty&#x27;s decision and orders would not have been so vehement had only British warships been concerned but the idea the first joint Anglo-American operation under British command might involve the destruction of American as well as British units may well have influenced the decisions of Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord. The Allied cruiser squadron was already beyond the standing orders set by the Admiralty and if no new orders had gone out, the cruisers would have had to withdraw some time afterwards in any case. The earlier cruiser movement did not influence the tactical situation but in light of later knowledge, the decision was deemed precipitate.

Unbeknownst to the escort and convoy commanders, the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; battlegroup was not advancing toward the convoy or anywhere near. &quot;Tirpitz&quot; had left Trondheim on 2 July to the port of Vestfjord; the next day, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Erich Raeder, received permission to move &quot;Tirpitz&quot; to Altenfjord to join the ships there. Prior to issuing the orders, Pound visited Whitehall and consulted an intelligence officer, Lieutenant Commander Norman Denning, to confirm that &quot;Tirpitz&quot; had left Altentfjord. Though Denning did not know if it was still there he did explain that his sources would have confirmed if the ship had or was about to put to sea. It was not until several hours after Pound&#x27;s orders that &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was shown still to be anchored at Altenfjord. &quot;Tirpitz&#x27;s&quot; battlegroup sailed on July 5 but the operation by surface ships to attack the convoy was cancelled and the ships returned to Altenfjord that day.

==Convoy losses==
When the order to scatter the convoy was received, it had covered more than half of its route and lost three ships. The consequences for the merchantmen were dire, the ships were spread over a wide area, stripped of mutual protection and their trained escort. As the larger escort vessels retreated from the suspected German surface force, messages on Merchant Navy wavelengths began to be received by the destroyers: &quot;Am being bombed by a large number of planes&quot;, &quot;On fire in the ice&quot;, &quot;Abandoning ship&quot;, &quot;Six U-boats approaching on the surface&quot;. With the majority of the escorts ordered to return to Scapa Flow, only the close escort of anti-aircraft auxiliaries, corvettes, minesweepers and armed trawlers was left to protect the scattered ships.

On 5 July, six merchantmen, including SS &quot;Fairfield City&quot; and SS &quot;Daniel Morgan&quot; were sunk by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and six more by four U-boats. Among the losses that day were SS &quot;Pan Kraft&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Carlton&quot;, &quot;Honomu&quot;, the Commodore&#x27;s flagship , and &quot;Peter Kerr&quot;. (&quot;Kerr&quot; was abandoned after a fire got out of control.) SS &quot;Paulus Potter&quot; had been abandoned by her crew after an aerial attack on 5 July; the ship was boarded by sailors from on 13 July; after taking the ship&#x27;s documents and flag, &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Reinhart Reche sank &quot;Potter&quot; with a torpedo.

On 6 July, SS &quot;Pan Atlantic&quot; was sunk by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and SS &quot;John Witherspoon&quot; by &quot;U-255&quot;. From 7 to 8 July, five more ships were sunk (two by &quot;U-255&quot;), including SS &quot;Olapana&quot; and SS &quot;Alcoa Ranger&quot;. The remaining escorts withdrew into the Arctic Ocean on 9 July but the merchant ships suffered no more that day. The last losses were SS &quot;Hoosier&quot; and SS &quot;El Capitan&quot; on 10 July. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; flew over 200 sorties and lost only five aircraft in exchange for the eight merchantmen.

On receiving the third order to scatter on 4 July 1942, Lieutenant Leo Gradwell RNVR, commanding the anti-submarine trawler , did not want to head for Archangelsk and led his convoy of &quot;Ayrshire&quot; and &quot;Troubador&quot;, &quot;Ironclad&quot; and &quot;Silver Sword&quot; north. On reaching the Arctic ice, the convoy pushed into it, then stopped engines and banked their fires. The crews used white paint from &quot;Troubador&quot;, covered the decks with white linen and arranged the Sherman tanks on the merchant vessels decks into a defensive formation, with loaded main guns. After a period of waiting and having evaded &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; reconnaissance aircraft, finding themselves unstuck, they proceeded to the Matochkin Strait. They were found there by a flotilla of corvettes, who escorted the four-ship convoy plus two other merchant vessels to Archangel, arriving on 25 July.

In the voyage to the Russian ports, some of the ships and lifeboat craft took refuge along the frozen coast of Novaya Zemlya, landing at Matochkin. The Soviet tanker &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; lost her cargo of linseed oil and much of SS &quot;Winston-Salem&quot;&#x27;s cargo was jettisoned in Novaya Zemlya. Many of the ships&#x27; locations were unknown, in spite of searches by Coastal Command aircraft, which had proceeded to north Russia after their patrols and by minesweepers and corvettes. A fortnight elapsed before the results of the attacks and the fate of the convoy were fully known. Of the 34 ships which had left Iceland, 23 were sunk; two British, four American, one Panamanian and two Russian merchant ships reached Arkhangelsk. Two American ships, &quot;Samuel Chase&quot; and &quot;Benjamin Harrison&quot;, docked at Murmansk. The deliveries amounted to out of the which had started from Iceland. Matériel losses in the convoy were: 3,350 vehicles, 210 aircraft, 430 tanks and 109,466 short tons (99,316 t) of other cargo such as food and ammunition.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, called the event, &quot;one of the most melancholy naval episodes in the whole of the war&quot;. An inquiry assigned no blame to anyone, since orders were issued by the First Sea Lord and blaming the First Sea Lord himself was considered politically unacceptable. The Soviet Union did not believe so many ships could be lost in one convoy and openly accused the Western Allies of lying. Despite the help provided by the material delivered, Convoy PQ 17 worsened Soviet–Allied relations over the short term, with the Soviets never acknowledging the efforts of Allied merchant seaman or sailors in either navy.

Joseph Stalin and Soviet naval experts found it difficult to understand the order to scatter given by the Admiralty, given &quot;that the escorting vessels of the Convoy PQ 17 should return, whereas the cargo boats should disperse and try to reach the Soviet ports one by one without any protection at all&quot;. Admiral King, already known to distrust the British, was furious with what he perceived as Admiral Pound&#x27;s bungling and promptly withdrew TF 39, sending it to the Pacific. He hesitated to conduct further joint operations under British command. Admiral Dan Gallery, USN, serving in Iceland at that time, called Convoy PQ 17 &quot;a shameful page in naval history&quot;.

In view of the Convoy PQ 17 disaster, the Admiralty proposed to suspend the Arctic convoys at least until the ice receded and perpetual daylight passed. At a conference with Hitler, Raeder stated, &quot;...our submarines and aircraft, which totally destroyed the last convoy, have forced the enemy to give up this route temporarily...&quot;. At a meeting with the head of the Soviet Military Mission, Admiral Nikolay Kharlamov and the Soviet ambassador in London, Ivan Maisky, the Soviets requested to know when Convoy PQ 18 would sail. Pound said nothing could be done until better Russian air cover was arranged, after which Kharlamov criticised the order to withdraw the cruisers from Convoy PQ 17. Pound was furious and deeply resented the Russian attitude. Pound angrily admitted that Convoy PQ 17 was scattered on his order while Maisky stated that &quot;even British admirals make mistakes&quot;.

===Subsequent operations===
It was not until September that Convoy PQ 18 set out for North Russia. The convoy&#x27;s defence scheme was revised, with a very strong constant close escort of sixteen destroyers and the first of the new escort carriers, , with twelve fighters and three Swordfish ASW aircraft. After the war there was criticism of this delay in American and Soviet sources. Soviet historians give varying reasons for the suspension and reduction in supply caused by the halt in the Arctic convoys. Some considered it the result of &quot;the fact that in 1942, Anglo-American (ocean) communications were destroyed&quot;.

==Awards and commemorations==
At least sixteen officers and men of the Merchant Navy were honoured for gallantry or distinguished service for the actions in the convoy. A supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; published on 6 October 1942 carried notification of two George Medals, six appointments to various grades of the Order of the British Empire, six British Empire Medals and two King&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct. In December 2012 the Arctic Star medal was created and on 19 March 2013 the first medals were presented to approximately 40 veterans, in London.

==&quot;Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd&quot;==
In 1968, David Irving published a controversial book about Convoy PQ 17. It concentrated on Allied blunders and shortcomings, alleging that Broome&#x27;s decision to withdraw his destroyers was the primary cause of the disaster to the convoy. Broome litigated in &quot;Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd&quot;, to defend his reputation. Broome won his case and was awarded £40,000 in damages and secured the withdrawal of all copies of the offending book from circulation (it has since been republished, with corrections). The damages (donated by Broome to charity) were the highest paid in English legal history until 1987.

==Notes==

a. This latter signal was intended merely as a correction of technical wording from &quot;disperse&quot; to &quot;scatter&quot;, but this was not known at the time. The order to scatter was only used under immediate threat of surface attack. Detailed instructions in each ship&#x27;s signal book laid down the actions that were to be taken by each ship on receipt of this order.

<doc id="240496" wikidata="Q953806" url="?curid=240496" title="Bus stop">
<text>A bus stop is a place where buses stop for passengers to get on and off the bus. The construction of bus stops tends to reflect the level of usage, where stops at busy locations may have shelters, seating, and possibly electronic passenger information systems; less busy stops may use a simple pole and flag to mark the location. Bus stops are, in some locations, clustered together into transport hubs allowing interchange between routes from nearby stops and with other public transport modes to maximise convenience.

==Types of service==

For operational purposes, there are three main kinds of stops: Scheduled stops, at which the bus should stop irrespective of demand; request stops (or flag stop), at which the vehicle will stop only on request; and hail and ride stops, at which a vehicle will stop anywhere along the designated section of road on request.

Certain stops may be restricted to &quot;discharge/set-down only&quot; or &quot;pick-up only&quot;. Some stops may be designated as &quot;timing points&quot;, and if the vehicle is ahead of schedule it will wait there to ensure correct synchronization with the timetable. In dense urban areas where bus volumes are high, skip-stops are sometimes used to increase efficiency and reduce delays at bus stops. Fare stages may also be defined by the location of certain stops in distance or zone-based fare collection systems. Sunday stops are close to a church and used only on Sundays.

== History ==
From the 17th to the 19th century, horse-drawn stage coaches ran regular services between many European towns, starting and stopping at designated coaching inns where the horses could be changed and passengers board or alight, in effect constituting the earliest form of bus stop. The Angel Inn, Islington, the first stop on the route from London to York, was a noted example of such an inn. A seat in a stage coach usually had to be booked in advance.

John Greenwood opened the first bus line in Britain in Manchester in 1824, running a fixed route and allowing passengers to board on request along the way without a reservation. Landmarks such as public houses, rail stations and road junctions became customary stopping points.

Regular horse-drawn buses started in Paris in 1828. George Shillibeer started his London horse Omnibus service in 1829, running between stops at Paddington (at the Yorkshire Stingo pub) and the Bank of England to a designated route and timetable. By the mid-19th century, guides were available to London bus routes, including maps with routes and the main stops.

== Design ==
Bus stop infrastructure ranges from a simple pole and sign, to a rudimentary shelter, to sophisticated structures. The usual minimum is a pole mounted &quot;flag&quot; with suitable name/symbol. Bus stop shelters may have a full or partial roof, supported by a two, three or four sided construction. Modern stops are mere steel and glass/perspex constructions, although in other places, such as rural Britain, stops may be wooden brick or concrete built.

The construction may include small inbuilt seats. The construction may feature advertising, from simple posters, to complex illuminated, changeable or animated displays. Some installations have also included interactive advertising. Advertising may be the primary reason for the shelter, and the advertising pays for the bus shelter. Design and construction may be uniform to reflect a large corporate or local authority provider, or installations may be more personal or distinctive where a small local authority such as a parish council is responsible for the stop. The stop may include separate street furniture such as a bench, lighting and a trash receptacle (dustbin).

Individual bus stops may simply be placed on the sidewalk/pavement next to the roadway, although they can also be placed to facilitate use of a busway. More complex installations can include construction of a bus turnout or a bus bulb, for traffic management reasons, although use of a bus lane can make these unnecessary. A &#x27;floating bus stop&#x27; or &#x27;bus stop bypass&#x27; is located between a road and a cycle lane, so that passengers must cross the cycle lane in order to reach it. They are &quot;ubiquitous in the Netherlands, and common across Europe&quot;.

Several bus stops may be grouped together to facilitate easy transfer between routes. These may be arranged in a simple row along the street, or in parallel or diagonal rows of multiple stops. Groups of bus stops may be integral to transportation hubs. With extra facilities such as a waiting room or ticket office, outside groupings of bus stops can be classed as a rudimentary bus station.

Convention is usually for the bus to draw level with the &#x27;flag&#x27;, although in areas of mixed front and rear entrance buses, such as London, a head stop, and more rarely a tail stop, indicates to the driver whether they should stop the bus with either the rear platform or the driver&#x27;s cab level with the flag.

In certain areas, the area of road next the bus stop may be specially marked, and protected in law. Often, car drivers can be unaware of the legal implications of stopping or parking at a bus stop.

In bus rapid transit systems, bus stops may be more elaborate than street bus stops, and can be termed &quot;stations&quot; to reflect this difference. These may have enclosed areas to allow off-bus fare collection for rapid boarding, and be spaced further apart, like tram stops. Bus stops on a bus rapid transit line may also have a more complex construction allowing level boarding platforms, and doors separating the enclosure from the bus until ready to board.


== Traffic signs ==
The bus stop flag (bus stop pole) is usually not only a carrier of information for passengers, but it also fulfills the role of a road sign that indicates the beginning (front) of the stop. In some places the flag may not indicate exactly the front of the stop, but is placed anywhere within the stop area.

In some countries (e.g. Czechia and Slovakia), there is also a different road sign that is intended to mark the end of the stop and thus indicate its length. The use of such a sign may be limited to only certain types of stops, for example only to stops located in a continuous traffic lane, or only to stops that can be used by more than one vehicle at the same time, or if the stop is located in an interruption of the parking lane.

There are also various types of horizontal traffic markings of bus stops on the road. Some consist only of writings that draw attention to a stop or a dedicated stop lane; some can precisely define the space and length of the stop, including the space designated for entering and exiting the stop.

In dangerous places, another warning sign can be placed in front of the bus stop, or a sign prohibiting from going around the bus in the bus stop, etc.

In rare cases, traffic signals may also be placed to allow the bus to exit the stop lane or to stop traffic while the bus is at the stop. The mutual position of the opposite stops and their position in relation to the pedestrian crossing should be designed in such a way that the danger to pedestrians is minimized.

== Information ==


===Public-facing information===

Most bus stops are identified with a metal sign attached to a pole or light standard. Some stops are plastic strips strapped on to poles and others involve a sign attached to a bus shelter. The signs are often identified with a picture of a bus and/or with the words &quot;bus stop&quot; in the local language.

The bus stop &quot;flag&quot; (a panel usually projecting from the top of a bus stop pole) will often show the route numbers of all the buses calling at the stop, perhaps distinguishing frequent, infrequent, 24-hour, and night services. The flag may also show the logo of the dominant bus operator, or the logo of a local transit authority with responsibility for bus services in the area. Additional information may include an unambiguous, unique name for the stop, and the direction/common destination(s) of most calling routes.

Bus stops will often show timetable information: either the full timetable, or for busier routes, the times or frequency that a bus will call at the specific stop. Route maps and tariff information may also be provided, and telephone numbers for relevant travel information services.

The stop may also incorporate, or have nearby, real time information displays with the arrival times of the next buses. Increasingly, mobile phone technology is being referenced on more remote stops, allowing the next bus times to be sent to a passenger&#x27;s handset based on the stop location and the real time information. Automated ticket machines may be provided at busy stops.

===Data model===
Modern passenger information systems and journey planners require a detailed digital representation of stops and stations. The CEN Transmodel data model, and the related IFOPT data interchange standard, define how transport systems, including bus stops, should be described for use in computer models. In Transmodel, a single bus stop is modeled as a &quot;Stop Point&quot;, and a grouping of nearby bus stops as a &quot;Stop Area&quot; or &quot;Stop Place&quot;. The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) standard, originally developed by Google and TriMet, defines a simple and widely used data interchange standard for public transport schedules. GTFS also includes a table of stop locations which for each stop gives a name, identifier, location, and identification with any larger station that the stop may be a part of. OpenStreetMap also has a modelling standard for bus stops.

The United Kingdom has collected a complete database of its public transport access points, including bus stops, into the National Public Transport Access Nodes (NaPTAN) database with details of 350,000 nodes and which is available as open Data from data.gov.uk. In this database, developed by the Department of Transport in 2001, stops are classified as &quot;marked&quot; or &quot;custom and usage&quot; (i.e. unmarked stops where the driver will stop the vehicle on request). Use of marked stops varies: either the bus will always stop, or will stop by request only.

==Safety==

Bus stops enhance passenger safety in a number of ways:
* Bus stops prevent passengers from trying to board or alight in hazardous situations such as at intersections or where a bus is turning and is not using the curb lane.
* A bus driver cannot be expected to continuously look for intending passengers. A bus stop means that the driver only needs to look for intending passengers at the approach to each bus stop.
* Having bus stops requires passengers to group themselves prior to boarding, which reduces time spent at boarding.
* At night, when passenger numbers are lower, restrictions are sometimes relaxed and passengers may be allowed to exit the bus anywhere within reason.
* Bus turnouts, or lay-bys, allow buses to stop without impeding the flow of traffic on the main roadway.

== Bus stop shelters ==
=== Cooling ===

In countries with hot climates, air-conditioned bus stop shelters are sometimes used, for example in Dubai in United Arab Emirates, Hyderabad in India, Eilat in Israel, Ashgabat in Turkmenistan.

As an alternative to air conditioning, passive daytime radiative cooling has been used to cool bus stop shelters. Bus stops at Arizona State University and the surrounding areas of Tempe, Arizona used a 3M film to lower shelter temperatures by 4 °C. A bus shelter in a mid-rise area of Tehran used passive cooling to cool a bus shelter by up to 10 °C.

== Regulation ==
Some jurisdictions have introduced particularised legislative controls to foster safer bus stop design and management. The State of Victoria, Australia, for example, has enacted a Bus Safety Act which contains performance-based duties of care which apply to all industry participants who are in a position to influence the safety of bus operations - what is called the &quot;chain of responsibility&quot;. The safety duties apply to all bus services, both commercial and non-commercial, and to all buses regardless of seating capacity. Breach of the duty is a serious criminal offence which carries a heavy penalty.

The primary duty holder under the Bus Safety Act is the operator of the bus service, as the person who has effective responsibility and control over the whole operation. However, the Act also contains a safety duty covering &quot;people with responsibility for bus stops&quot;, including people who design, build, or maintain the stop, plus those who decide on its location.

This duty was introduced in response to research showing that the most serious hazard associated with bus travel occurs when passengers, especially children, are crossing the road after alighting from the bus. The location and layout of a bus stop is therefore a factor in the level of risk.

Safety duties are also imposed by the Bus Safety Act on a range of other people including -
* &quot;bus safety workers&quot; including drivers, schedulers who set bus timetables, and mechanics and testers who repair or assess vehicle safety
* &quot;procurers&quot; - people who procure the bus service, known as the &quot;customer&quot; in the commercial charter sector.

All of these persons can clearly affect bus safety. They are required by the Bus Safety Act to ensure that, in carrying out their activities, they eliminate risks to health and safety if &#x27;practicable&#x27; - or work to reduce those risks &#x27;so far as is reasonably practicable&#x27;. This familiar practicability formula is borrowed from Victoria&#x27;s Rail Safety Act (and a subsequent national model Rail Safety Bill) and the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004.

In Europe, as a rule, the design of roads and the placement of road signs are subject to detailed technical standards, the requirements of which should ensure the safety of local traffic regulation, and is subject to official approval. As a rule, it is permissible to place a stop of a bus line only in a place that is approved and marked as a bus stop.

== Research ==
Bus stop capacity is often an important consideration in the planning of bus stops serving multiple routes within urban centers. Limited capacity may mean buses queue up behind each other at the bus stop, which can cause traffic blockages or delays. Bus stop capacity is typically measured in terms of buses/hour that can reliably use the bus stop. The main factors that affect bus stop capacity are:
* Number of loading areas (or number of buses that can stop at one time)
* Average dwell time (How much time it takes a bus to load/unload passengers)
* G/C ratio of nearby traffic signal (green time / cycle length)
* Clearance time (time it takes bus to re-enter the traffic stream)
Detailed procedures for calculating bus stop capacity and bus lane capacity using skip stops are outlined in Part 4 of the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, published by the US Transportation Research Board.

Transit agencies are increasingly looking at consolidation of possibly previously haphazardly placed bus stops as a way to improve service cheaply and easily. Bus stop consolidation evaluates the bus stops along an established bus route and develops a new pattern for optimal bus stop placement. Bus stop consolidation has been proven to improve operating efficiency and ridership on bus routes.

== Fakes ==

Some nursing homes and hospitals have built fake, imitation bus stops for their residents who have dementia. Some of these bus stops are even fitted with old advertisements and timetables to give a sense of familiarity. The residents will sit at the bus stop waiting for a bus to take them to their imagined destination. After some time, a staff member comes to escort the clients back to the home.

==In popular culture==
Bus stops are common tropes in popular culture. In 1956, there was a Marilyn Monroe film called &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. A famous scene in the movie &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; takes place at a bus stop and almost all episodes of &quot;South Park&quot; series start by presenting the main characters in a bus stop.

In Japanese culture, the movie &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; featured a bus stop, both for ordinary buses and a cat bus. The opening scene of the anime &quot;Air&quot; shows the main character getting off at a bus stop. The Japanese movie &quot;Summer Wars&quot; features a rural bus stop.

Renowned rabbis have taught lessons in Judaism from their interaction and experience with bus stops.

<doc id="240498" wikidata="Q1386945" url="?curid=240498" title="Fibularis longus">
<text>In human anatomy, the fibularis longus (also known as peroneus longus) is a superficial muscle in the lateral compartment of the leg. It acts to tilt the sole of the foot away from the midline of the body (eversion) and to extend the foot downward away from the body (plantar flexion) at the ankle.

The fibularis longus is the longest and most superficial of the three fibularis (peroneus) muscles. At its upper end, it is attached to the head of the fibula, and its &quot;belly&quot; runs down along most of this bone. The muscle becomes a tendon that wraps around and behind the lateral malleolus of the ankle, then continues under the foot to attach to the medial cuneiform and first metatarsal. It is supplied by the superficial fibular nerve.

== Structure ==
The fibularis longus arises from the head and upper two-thirds of the lateral, or outward, surface of the fibula, from the deep surface of the fascia, and from the connective tissue between it and the muscles on the front and back of the leg. It occasionally is also connected by a few fibers from the lateral condyle of the tibia. Between the muscle&#x27;s attachments to the head and body of the fibula, there is a gap through which the common fibular nerve passes to the front of the leg.

The muscle ends in a long tendon, which runs behind the lateral malleolus of the ankle in a groove that it shares with the tendon of the fibularis brevis; the groove is converted into a canal by the superior fibular retinaculum, and the tendons in it are contained in a common mucous sheath.

The tendon then extends forward at an angle across the lateral side of the foot, below the fibular trochlea and the tendon of the fibularis brevis, and under cover of the inferior fibular retinaculum. It crosses the lateral side of the cuboid and then runs underneath the cuboid in a groove that is converted into a canal by the long plantar ligament. The tendon then crosses the sole of the foot at an angle and inserts into the lateral side of the base of the first metatarsal and the lateral side of the medial cuneiform. Occasionally, it also sends a slip to the base of the second metatarsal.

The tendon changes direction at two points: first, behind the lateral malleolus; second, on the cuboid bone. In both of these locations, the tendon is thickened. At the cuboid, a fibrocartilaginous sesamoid (sometimes a sesamoid bone) usually develops in the substance of the tendon.

The fibularis longus muscle is supplied by the superficial fibular nerve, which arises from the fifth lumbar and first sacral roots of the spinal cord.

== Function ==
The fibularis longus, together with the fibularis brevis and the tibialis posterior, extend the foot downward away from the body at the ankle (plantar flexion). It opposes the tibialis anterior and the fibularis tertius, which pull the foot upward toward the body (dorsiflexion).

The fibularis longus also tilts the sole of the foot away from the midline of the body (eversion). Because of the angle at which it crosses the sole of the foot, it plays an important role in maintaining the transverse arch of the foot.

Together, the fibularis muscles help to steady the leg upon the foot, especially in standing on one leg.

== Nomenclature and etymology ==
&quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot; designates &quot;fibularis&quot; as the preferred word over &quot;peroneus.&quot;.

The word &quot;peroneus&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;perone,&quot; meaning pin of a brooch or a buckle. In medical terminology, the word refers to being of or relating to the fibula or to the outer portion of the leg.

<text>The Battle of Sedgemoor was the last and decisive engagement between the Kingdom of England and rebels led by the Duke of Monmouth during the Monmouth rebellion, fought on 6 July 1685, and took place at Westonzoyland near Bridgwater in Somerset, England, resulting in a victory for the English army.

It was the final battle of the Monmouth Rebellion and followed a series of skirmishes around south-west England between the rebel forces of the Duke of Monmouth, and the Royal Army, still loyal to James II. Victory went to the Government and about 500 prisoners fell into their hands. Monmouth escaped from the battlefield but was captured, taken to London and executed nine days later. Many of Monmouth&#x27;s supporters were tried during the Bloody Assizes. Many were transported abroad, while others were executed by drawing and quartering.

==Background==

It was the final battle of the Monmouth Rebellion, by which the rebel James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, attempted to seize the English throne from his uncle James II of England. James II had succeeded to the throne on the death of his brother Charles II on 2 February 1685; James Scott was Charles&#x27; illegitimate son.

After Monmouth landed from the Dutch Republic at Lyme Regis in Dorset, there had been a series of marches and skirmishes throughout Dorset and Somerset. Eventually Monmouth&#x27;s poorly equipped army was pushed back to the Somerset Levels, becoming hemmed in at Bridgwater on 3 July. He ordered his troops to fortify the town. The force was made up of around 3,500, mostly nonconformist, artisans and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks).

The royalist troops, led by Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham, and Colonel John Churchill, were camped behind the Bussex Rhine at Westonzoyland. The infantry forces included 500 men of the 1st Regiment of Foot (the Royal Scots), known as Dumbarton&#x27;s Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas; two battalions of the 1st or King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of Guards (Grenadier Guards), respectively led by Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, and Major Eaton; 600 men of the Second Regiment of Guards (later the Coldstream Guards) under Lieutenant-Colonel Sackville; five companies of the Queen Dowager&#x27;s or the Tangier Regiment (later 2nd Foot), known as &quot;Kirke&#x27;s Lambs&quot;; and five companies of the Queen Consort&#x27;s Regiment (Kings Own Royal Regiment), also known as Trelawny&#x27;s Regiment, which was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Churchill, Colonel John Churchill&#x27;s younger brother. The Horse and Foot, the Royal Train of Artillery was camped along the road to Bridgwater. The Royal Cavalry, with seven troops of 420 men of the Earl of Oxford&#x27;s, the Kings Regiment of Horse (Blues and Royals), led by Colonel Sir Francis Compton; the King&#x27;s Own Royal Dragoons; and three troops of the King&#x27;s Horse Guards (Lifeguards) made up the army.

== Royalist force ==
The royalist force included the following regiments:
* Royal Regiment of Horse, commanded by Lieutenant General Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford 
* Queen&#x27;s Regiment of Horse, commanded by Lieutenant General Sir John Lanier
* King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment of Dragoons, commanded by General John Churchill
* 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, commanded by Brigadier General Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton 
* 1st Battalion, Earl of Dumbarton&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, commanded by Lieutenant General Lord George Douglas, 1st Earl of Dumbarton 

==Battle==
The Duke eventually led his troops out of Bridgwater at around 10:00 pm to undertake a night-time attack on the King&#x27;s army. They were guided by Richard Godfrey, the servant of a local farmer, along the old Bristol road towards Bawdrip. With their limited cavalry in the vanguard, they turned south along Bradney Lane and Marsh Lane, and came to the open moor with its deep and dangerous rhynes.

There was a delay while the rhyne was crossed and the first men across startled a royalist patrol. A shot was fired and a horseman from the patrol galloped off to report to Feversham. Lord Grey of Warke led the rebel cavalry forward and they were engaged by the King&#x27;s Regiment of Horse which alerted the rest of the royalist forces. The superior training of the regular army and their horses enabled them to rout the rebel forces by outflanking them.

==Aftermath==

Monmouth escaped from the battlefield with Grey and they headed for the south coast disguised as peasants. They were captured near Ringwood, Hampshire. Monmouth was taken to the Tower of London, where he was, after several blows of the axe, beheaded.

A letter written by the Earl of Shaftesbury in 1787 provides more detail as to Monmouth&#x27;s capture:

After the battle, about 500 of Monmouth&#x27;s troops were captured and imprisoned in St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church in Westonzoyland, while others were hunted and shot in the ditches where they were hiding. More were hanged from gibbets erected along the roadside. The royalist troops were rewarded, with Feversham being made a Knight of the Garter, Churchill promoted to major-general and Henry Shires of the artillery receiving a knighthood. Other soldiers, particularly those who had been wounded, received allowances ranging from £5 to £80. Some of the wounded were among the first to be treated at the newly opened Royal Hospital Chelsea.

The king sent Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys to round up the Duke&#x27;s supporters throughout the south-west and try them in the Bloody Assizes at Taunton Castle and elsewhere. About 1,300 people were found guilty, many being transported abroad, while some were executed by drawing and quartering. Daniel Defoe, who would later write the novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, had taken part in the uprising and battle. He was heavily fined by Jeffreys, losing much of his land and wealth. Two brothers Benjamin Hewling, a commander of a troop of horse, and William Hewling, lieutenant of foot, were among those condemned to death. Benjamin Hewling was hanged rather than drawn and quartered following a payment of £1000 by his sister.

James II was overthrown in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; three years later, in the Glorious Revolution.

==Last battle on English soil==

The Battle of Sedgemoor is often referred to as the last pitched battle fought on English soil, but this depends on the definition of &#x27;battle&#x27;, for which there are different interpretations. Other contenders for the title of last English battle include: the Battle of Preston in Lancashire, which was fought on 14 November 1715, during the First Jacobite Rebellion; and the Second Jacobite Rebellion&#x27;s Clifton Moor Skirmish, near Penrith, Cumberland, on 18 December 1745. The Battle of Culloden, fought on Drumossie Moor to the north-east of Inverness on 16 April 1746, was the last pitched battle fought on British soil.

==Cultural references==

The Battle of Sedgemoor is depicted in detail at the climax of the plot in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s historical adventure novel &quot;Micah Clarke&quot;. The Battle also appears in Blackmore&#x27;s &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;, where the hero arrives on the battlefield as the battle is finishing, and is then escorted home by the King&#x27;s soldiers to safety. Likewise, &quot;The Royal Changeling&quot; (1998) by John Whitbourn describes the rebellion, with some fantasy elements added. The Battle of Sedgemoor both opens and concludes the novel. A collection of poems (&quot;Sedgemoor&quot;), exploring the battle and consequences of the rebellion, was written by poet and academic Malcolm Povey and published by Smokestack Books in 2006. The poems move between 1685 and the present day, as a narrative technique. Povey&#x27;s book received praise, especially for its originality: &quot;Not many poets try something as different and ambitious as this. It deserves to be widely read.&quot; The battle is commemorated in Val Wake&#x27;s poem &quot;Dead Willows Mourn&quot;. Wake, an Australian born journalist and author, lived in Westonzoyland from 1973 to 1979. Events surrounding the battle occupy the first few chapters of Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s novel &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. The battle is also included/mentioned in the beginning of the 1935 movie &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. The battle serves as the historical background to a series of murders in the novel &quot;Down Among the Dead&quot; (2020) by Damien Boyd.

The Sealed Knot re-enactment society have re-enacted important parts of the rebellion&#x27;s campaign, on the 300th anniversary in 1985, and again in 2005. For the first re-enactment, the folk trio Strawhead produced an album of various songs from the time and written especially, entitled &#x27;Sedgemoor&#x27;. The Battle of Sedgemoor was also a central plot in the 1972 HTV series &quot;Pretenders&quot;, which was broadcast in 13 half-hour episodes. A mural depicting the battle can be found on display at Sedgemoor motorway services on the North carriageway of the M5.

<doc id="240510" wikidata="Q664398" url="?curid=240510" title="Felix Calonder">
<text>Felix Louis Calonder (7 December 1863 – 14 June 1952) was a Swiss politician, member of the Swiss Federal Council from 1913 to 1920, and President of the Confederation in 1918. He was affiliated to the Free Democratic Party. During his tenure of office, he held the Department of Home Affairs from 1913 to 1917, and the Political Department from 1918 to 1919. As of 2022, Felix Calonder has been the Federal Council&#x27;s only native Romansh speaker.

== Early life (1863–1891) ==
Calonder was born in Scuol in the Engadin valley, the son of a master builder from Trin. When Calonder was six years old, his family moved to Trin, where he went to elementary school. From 1878 to 1881 Calonder visited the cantonal school in Chur. He dropped out, worked as a commercial trainée for three years, and didn&#x27;t graduate with a Matura until 1885 in Zürich. He studied law in Zürich, Munich, Paris, and Bern, where he submitted his doctoral thesis on international law in 1889. He was active in the student corporation &quot;Zofingia&quot;, and became a militia officer and judge in the Swiss Armed Forces.

After completing his studies, Calonder returned to Chur, where he worked as a court secretary, and later established his own partnership in a lawyer&#x27;s office. In 1892, he married Ursulina Walther, with whom he had three children.

== Legislative offices (1891–1913) ==
In 1891, Calonder was elected to the Grisons&#x27; cantonal legislative (cussegl grond) where he represented the Free Democrats, and kept his mandate until 1913. He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the cantonal executive (regenza) in 1893. By the late 1890s, he had gained a reputation in transport policy; his struggle for an eastern alpine railway and his lobbying for federal subsidies to the Rhätische Bahn&#x27;s narrow-gauge system helped him win his party one of the Grisons&#x27; two seats in the Swiss Council of States in 1899. During his tenure in the Council of States, he was given the mandate to negotiate an agreement with the Grand Duchy of Baden regarding the usage of the Rhine for ship transport and hydropower. He presided the Council of States for the 1911/1912 term.

== Federal council (1913–1920) ==
When Federal Councillor Adolf Deucher died in 1912, Calonder was one of the candidates for the vacant seat in the Swiss Federal Council. On 17 July 1912 he lost the election to Edmund Schulthess in the first vote, partially due to Schulthess&#x27;s strong support by Catholic Conservatives, farmers&#x27; organizations, and the industrial lobby. Disappointed by the result, Grison politicians and media called for a boycott of the Swiss National Day (1 August) in 1912.

The following year, in May 1913, Federal councillor Louis Perrier died, and Calonder&#x27;s candidacy looked more promising. The Catholic Conservatives now supported him. A few federal politicians were worried about Calonder&#x27;s bias in promoting the Grisons&#x27; interests in the alpine railway, and Calonder&#x27;s election would make the Romandie lose one of its two councillors it had been providing since 1881. Nevertheless, Calonder won the election in the first round with 151 out of 199 valid votes, and without any noteworthy opposition (Arthur Couchepin received the second-best result with 11 votes). Calonder assumed office in the Swiss Federal Council on 21 June 1913.

For the first four years, Calonder held the Department of Home Affairs. One of the first bills he had to represent before the Federal Assembly concerned the federal decision on creating the only Swiss National Park.

In 1918, Calonder was elected President of the Swiss Confederation and, as was customary for that office at the time, also took over the &quot;Political Department&quot; (foreign relations). In his function as president, he was faced with increased expression of social grievances by the working class and poor, and started meeting with the &quot;Oltener Aktionskomitee&quot; (OAK) in August 1918. The OAK was a committee of Swiss labor unions and Social democrats, formed to demand and enforce socio-political reforms, and led by Robert Grimm. When the authorities used military force to discontinue the extension of an originally peaceful protest strike in Zürich on 10 November, the committee gave Calonder the ultimatum to either call back the militia or accept the consequences of a nationwide strike, Calonder declined in the name of the Federal Council, and on 11 November 1918 the committee called for an indefinite strike, now referred to as the . Around 400,000 workers went on strike, militia regiments were ordered to counter them, and the railway system was militarized. Three demonstrators were killed by soldiers in Grenchen, and there were violent clashes in Zürich and Biel as well. The OAK recognized the strike&#x27;s futility, and called for its ending, Calonder informed the Federal Assembly with the words &quot;The nightmare has gone away. Free and proud, Swiss democracy stands with its head raised high.&quot;
Calonder was criticized for his actions during the Landesstreik. He had already been mocked by Grimm for &quot;nearly breaking out in tears during negotiations, instead of firmly standing his ground&quot;, and the Federal Assembly and media saw his reactions to the strike as ambiguous: On the one hand, Calonder held a speech on 12 November, when he promised the Social Democrats a seat in the Federal Council. On the other hand, put under pressure by the army command and centre-right parliamentarians, he signed the Federal Council&#x27;s ultimatum addressed to the OAK one day later. He never regained the left&#x27;s support, and after his demission in 1920, the Social Democratic newspaper &quot;&quot; characterized him as &quot;a rather limited reactionary&quot;.

In his final year in the Federal Council, Calonder was a proponent of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s idea for a League of Nations, and appointed historians and legal experts to study questions of international law in the aftermath of World War I. Instead of &quot;absolute&quot; neutrality, he suggested a &quot;differential&quot; neutrality, which could include carrying out economic sanctions proposed by the League of Nations. With the support of fellow councillors Giuseppe Motta and Gustave Ador, Calonder finally succeeded in passing the bill to join the League of Nations against strong opposition by politicians from German speaking rural and conservative cantons, but also against the majority of Social Democrats. He gained less support for his actions regarding the &quot;Vorarlberg question&quot; - on 11 May 1919 80% of the Vorarlberger had voted that their state should join Switzerland, and Calonder advocated these plans as well. He met fierce opposition within the Federal Council, namely by Schulthess and Motta, and was eventually forced to abandon his advancements in this direction.

His actions during the nationwide strike, his advancement of membership in the League of Nations, and his weak position in the Vorarlberg question resulted in a meager count of votes for Calonder&#x27;s reconfirmation by the Federal Assembly in December 1919. He asked for sick leave five days later, and announced his resignation on 21 January 1920. The Federal Assembly officially approved his request on 12 February 1920 and elected Heinrich Häberlin as his successor.

== Later years (1920–1952) ==
After his demission, Calonder was appointed by the League of Nations to mediate in the Åland crisis in 1920. In 1921 he led the Geneva conference for regulating conditions in Upper Silesia in connection with the Silesian Uprisings. From 1922 to 1937, he lived in Katowice where, as president of the mixed German-Polish commission, he supervised the execution of the conference&#x27;s outcome. In 1937, he moved to Zürich and worked as a legal consultant. Felix Louis Calonder died on 14 June 1952 in Zürich.

<doc id="240512" wikidata="Q273997" url="?curid=240512" title="Duiker">
<text>A duiker is a small to medium-sized brown antelope native to sub-Saharan Africa, found in heavily wooded areas. The 22 extant species, including three sometimes considered to be subspecies of the other species, form the subfamily Cephalophinae or the tribe Cephalophini.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The tribe Cephalophini (formerly the subfamily Cephalophinae) comprises three genera and 22 species, three of which are sometimes considered to be subspecies of the other species. The three genera include &quot;Cephalophus&quot; (15 species and three disputed taxa), &quot;Philantomba&quot; (three species), and &quot;Sylvicapra&quot; (one species). The subfamily was first described by British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1871 in &quot;Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London&quot;. The scientific name &quot;Cephalophinae&quot; probably comes from the combination of the New Latin word &quot;cephal&quot;, meaning head, and the Greek word &quot;lophos&quot;, meaning crest.

The three disputed species in &quot;Cephalophus&quot; are Brooke&#x27;s duiker (&quot;C. brookei&quot;), Ruwenzori duiker (&quot;C. rubidis&quot;), and the white-legged duiker (&quot;C. crusalbum&quot;). Considered to be a subspecies of Ogilby&#x27;s duiker (&quot;C. nigrifrons&quot;), Brooke&#x27;s duiker was elevated to species status by British ecologist Peter Grubb in 1998. Its status as a species was further seconded in a 2002 publication by Grubb and colleague Colin Groves. However, zoologists such as Jonathan Kingdon continue to treat it as a subspecies. The Ruwenzori duiker is generally considered to be a subspecies of the black-fronted duiker (&quot;C. nigrifrons&quot;). However, significant differences from another race of the same species, &quot;C. n. kivuensis&quot;, with which it is sympatric on the Ruwenzori mountain range, led Kingdon to suggest that it might be a different species altogether. Grubb treated the white-legged duiker as a subspecies of Ogilby&#x27;s duiker in 1978, but regarded as an independent species by him and Groves after a revision in 2011. This was supported by a 2003 study.

A 2001 phylogenetic study divided &quot;Cephalophus&quot; into three distinct lineages - the giant duikers, east African red duikers, and west African red duikers. Abbott&#x27;s duiker (&quot;C. spadix&quot;), the bay duiker (&quot;C. dorsalis&quot;), Jentink&#x27;s duiker (&quot;C. jentinki&quot;) and the yellow-backed duiker (&quot;C. silvicultor&quot;) were classified as the giant duikers. The east African red duikers include the black-fronted duiker (&quot;C. nigrifrons&quot;), Harvey&#x27;s duiker (&quot;C. harveyi&quot;), red-flanked duiker (&quot;C. rufilatus&quot;), red forest duiker (&quot;C. natalensis&quot;), Ruwenzori duiker, and white-bellied duiker (&quot;C. leucogaster&quot;). The third group, the west African red duikers, comprises the black duiker (&quot;C. niger&quot;), Ogilby&#x27;s duiker, Peters&#x27; duiker (&quot;C. callipygus&quot;), and Weyns&#x27;s duiker (&quot;C. weynsi&quot;). However, the status of two species, Aders&#x27;s duiker and zebra duiker, remained dubious.

In 2012, Anne R. Johnston (of the University of Orleans) and colleagues constructed a cladogram of the subfamily Cephalophinae (duiker) based on mitochondrial analysis.

==Etymology==
The common name &quot;duiker&quot; comes from the Afrikaans word &quot;duik&quot;, or Dutch &quot;duiken&quot; - both mean &quot;to dive&quot;, which refers to the practice of the animals to frequently dive into vegetation for cover.

==Description==

Duikers are split into two groups based on their habitat – forest and bush duikers. All forest species inhabit the rainforests of sub-Saharan Africa, while the only known bush duiker, grey common duiker occupies savannas. Duikers are very shy, elusive creatures with a fondness for dense cover; those that tend to live in more open areas, for example, are quick to disappear into thickets for protection.

Because of their rarity and interspersed population, not much is known about duikers; thus, further generalizations are widely based on the most commonly studied red forest, blue, yellow-backed, and common grey duiker. In tropical rainforest zones of Africa, people nonselectively hunt duikers for their hide, meat, and horns at highly unsustainable rates. Population trends for all species of duikers, excluding the common duiker and the smallest blue duiker, are significantly decreasing; Aders&#x27; and particularly the larger duiker species such as the Jentink&#x27;s and Abbott&#x27;s duikers, are now considered endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

== Anatomy and physiology ==

Duikers range from the blue duiker to the yellow-backed duiker. With their bodies low to the ground and with very short horns, forest duikers are built to navigate effectively through dense rainforests and quickly dive into bushes when threatened. Since the common grey duiker lives in more open areas, such as savannas, it has longer legs and vertical horns, which allow it to run faster and for longer distances; only the males, which are more confrontational and territorial, exhibit horns. Also, duikers have well-developed preorbital glands, which resemble slits under their eyes, or in the cases of blue duikers, pedal glands on their hooves. Males use secretions from these glands to mark their territories.

Besides reproduction, duikers behave in highly independent manner and prefer to act alone. This may, in part, explain the limited sexual size dimorphism shown by most duiker species, excluding the common duiker, in which the females are distinctly larger than the males.

Also, body size is proportional to the amount of food intake and the size of food. Anatomical features such as the head and neck shape also limit the amount and size of food intake. “Anatomical variations... impose further constraints on ingestion” causing differences in the food sources among different species of duiker.

== Behaviour ==

===Interactions===

In 2001, Helen Newing&#x27;s study in West Africa on the interactions of duikers found that body size, habitat preference, and activity patterns were the main differentiating factors among the seven species of duikers. These differences specific to each species of duiker allow them to coexist by limiting niche overlap. However, although some species are yet to be considered endangered, because of the repeated damage and habitat fragmentation of their habitat by human activities, such specialization of the niches are gradually becoming impaired and are contributing to the significant decrease in population.

Due to their relative size and reserved nature, duikers&#x27; primary defense mechanism is to hide from predators. Duikers are known for their extreme shyness, freezing at the slightest sign of a threat and diving into the nearest bush. Duikers&#x27; social behavior involves maintaining sufficient distance between individuals. However, in contrast to their conserved nature, duikers are more aggressive when dealing with territories; they mark their territory and their mates with secretions from their preorbital glands and fight other duikers that challenge their authorities. Male common duikers, especially the younger males, mark their territories also by defecation.

For those duikers that travel alone, they choose to interact with other duikers once or twice a year, solely for the purpose of mating. Although duikers occasionally form temporary groups to gather fallen fruit, because so little is known about how they interact and affect one another, determining which factors contribute the most to their endangerment is difficult.

Duikers prefer to live alone or as pairs to avoid the competition that comes from living in a large group. They have also evolved to become highly selective feeders, feeding only on specific parts of plants. In fact, in his study regarding the relationship between group size and feeding style, P.J. Jarman found that the more selective an organism&#x27;s diet is, the more dispersed its food will be, and consequently, the smaller the group becomes.

===Diet===

Duikers are primarily browsers rather than grazers, eating leaves, shoots, seeds, fruit, buds, and bark, and often following flocks of birds or troops of monkeys to take advantage of the fruit they drop. They supplement their diets with meat: duikers consume insects and carrion from time to time and even manage to capture rodents or small birds. Since food is the deciding factor, various locations of food sources often dictate the distribution of duikers. While they feed on a wide range of plants, they choose to eat specific parts of the plant that are most nutritious. Therefore, to feed efficiently, they must be familiar with their territory and be thoroughly acquainted with the geography and distribution of specific plants. For such reasons, duikers readjusting to novel environments created by human settlements and deforestation is not easy.

The smaller species, for example the blue duiker, generally tend to eat various seeds, while larger ones tend to feast more on larger fruits. Since blue duikers are very small, they are more efficient in digesting small, high-quality items. Receiving most of their water from the foods they eat, duikers do not rely on drinking water and can be found in waterless areas.

===Activity patterns===
Duikers can be diurnal, nocturnal, or both. Since the majority of the food source is available in the daytime, duiker evolution has rendered most duikers as diurnal. A correlation exists between body size and sleep pattern in duikers. While smaller to medium-sized duikers show increased activity and scavenge for food during the daytime, larger duikers are most active at night. An exception to this is the yellow-backed duiker, the largest species, which is active during both day and night.

===Distribution and abundance===
Duikers are found sympatrically in many different regions. Most species dwell in the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa, creating overlapping regions among different species of forest duikers. Although &quot;body size is the primary factor in defining the fundamental niches of each species&quot;, often dictating the distribution and abundance of duikers in a given habitat, distinguishing between the numerous species of duikers based purely on distribution and abundance is often difficult. For example, the blue duiker and red forest duiker coexist within a small area of Mossapoula (Central African Republic). While blue duikers are seen more frequently than red forest duikers in the heavily hunted area of Mossapoula, red forest duikers are more observed in a less exploited regions such as the western Dja Reserve of Cameroon.

== Ecology ==
Conservation of duikers has a direct and critical relationship with their ecology. Disruption of balance in the system leads to unprecedented competition, both interspecific and intraspecific. Before intervention, the system of specialized resources in which larger duikers exploit a particular type of food and smaller duikers on another, is functional as modeled in the diurnal and nocturnal nature of the duikers; this allows the niche to be shared by others without distinct interspecific competition. Similarly, they decrease intraspecific competition by being solitary, independent, and selective in eating habits. In consequence, disruption of the competitive balance in one habitat often cascades its effect on to the competitive balance in another habitat.

Also, a correlation exists between body size and diet. Larger animals have more robust digestive systems, stronger jaws, and wider necks, which allow them to consume lower-quality foods and larger fruits and seeds.

Similarly, bay and Peters&#x27; duikers can coexist because of their different sleep patterns. This allows Peters&#x27; duikers to eat fruits by day, and the bay duikers to eat what is left by night. In consequence of such a life pattern, the bay duiker&#x27;s digestive system has evolved to consume remaining, rather poor-quality foods.

Another critical influence that duikers have on the environment is acting as “seed dispersers for some plants”. They maintain a mutualistic relationship with certain plants; the plants serve as a nutritious and abundant food source for the duikers, and simultaneously benefit from the extensive dispersal of their seeds by the duikers.

== Conservation ==
Duikers live in an environment where even a subtle change in their life patterns can greatly impact the surrounding ecosystem. Two of the main factors that directly lead to duiker extinction are habitat loss and overexploitation. Constant urbanization and the process of “shifting agriculture” is gradually taking over many of duikers&#x27; habitats; at the same time, overexploitation is also permitting the overgrowth of other interacting species, resulting in an inevitable disruption of coexistence.

Overexploitation of duikers affects their population and organisms that rely on them for survival. For instance, plants that depend on duikers for seed dispersal may lose their primary method of reproduction, and other organisms that depend on these particular plants as their resources would also have their major source of food reduced.

Duikers are often captured for bushmeat. In fact, duikers are one of the most hunted animals both in terms of number and biomass in Central Africa. For example, in areas near the African rainforests, because people do not raise their own livestock, many people of all classes rely on bushmeat as their source of protein For these people, if the trend of overexploitation continues at such a high rate, the effects of the population decrease in duikers will be too severe for these organisms to serve as a reliable food source.

In addition to the unnaturally high demand for bushmeat, unenforced hunting law is a perpetual threat to many species, including the duiker. Most hunters believe that the diminishing number of animals was due to overexploitation. The direct effects of hunting include overexploitation of target species and incidental hunting of nontargeted or rare species (because hunting is largely nonselective).

To avoid this outcome, viable methods of conserving duikers are access restriction and captive breeding. Access restriction involves imposing temporal or spatial restrictions on hunting duikers. Temporal restrictions include closing off certain seasons, such as the main birth season, to hunting; spatial restrictions include closing off certain regions where endangered duikers are found. Captive breeding has been used and is often looked to as a solution to ensuring the survival of the duiker population; however, due to the duikers&#x27; low reproductive rate, even with the protection provided by the conservationists, captive breeding would not increase the overall population&#x27;s growth rate.

The greatest challenge facing the conservation of duikers is the lack of sufficient knowledge regarding these organisms, coupled with their unique population dynamics. The need is to not only thoroughly understand their population dynamics, but also establish methods to differentiate among the various species.

=== Bushmeat industry ===
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the sale of duiker bushmeat as contributing to the spread of filoviruses such as Ebola, citing Georges et al., 1999. The WHO notes that risk of infection predominantly arises from slaughter and preparation of meat, and that consumption of properly cooked meat does not pose a risk.

<text>Heinrich Häberlin (6 September 1868 – 26 February 1947) was a Swiss politician, judge and member of the Swiss Federal Council (1920–1934).

From 1904 he was a member of the Swiss Council of States, from 1905 member of the Grand Council of the Canton of Thurgau. For four years he presided over the FDP in the Swiss Federal Assembly. On 12 February 1920, he was elected to the Federal Council and was in charge of the Justice and Police Department from which he resigned on 30 April 1934. Twice, in 1926 and 1931, he was elected President of the Federal Council, making him the highest ranking representative of the Swiss Confederation.

== Biography ==

=== Family background, education ===
Heinrich Häberlin was born 1868 in Weinfelden as the son of Friedrich Heinrich Häberlin (1834–1897).

The Häberlin family was influential on many levels in Swiss politics over the years and for this reason was occasionally referred to as the &quot;Dynastengeschlecht der Häberlinge&quot; (Family Dynasty of Häberlin).

His uncle Eduard Häberlin (1820–1884) was president of the Council of States.

=== Professional life===

Upon graduation from &quot;Kantonsschule Frauenfeld&quot; in 1887, he began law studies at the University of Zürich and continued his studies at the University of Leipzig and at the Humboldt University in Berlin. While in Leipzig which was the German stronghold for jurisprudence, he formed a friendship with Prinz Ferdinand von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who was later crowned King Ferdinand I. of Great Romania. Though their ways parted, they met again years later when King Ferdinand I. was on an official state visit in Switzerland. 
Häberlin received his lawyer´s license in 1891 and completed a short internship in Lausanne at the lawyer´s office of Federal Councillor Louis Ruchonnet. In 1892 he opened his own law firm in Weinfelden, which two years later he moved to the canton capital of Frauenfeld. He quickly gained a reputation for being an outstanding lawyer and became the most sought after in this area of Switzerland. From 1899 to 1920 he presided over the District Court Frauenfeld. Häberlin got actively involved in politics, which was a common practice among judges and lawyers at that time. And in 1904 he was elected into the Swiss Federal Council of which he was president in 1918–1919. In addition to his political activities at the national level, Häberlin was also active in local politics in the Canton of Thurgau. In 1905 he was elected to the Grand Council of the Canton of Thurgau, where he served for 15 years. Twice he was appointed President of the Grand Council (1909/10 and 1915/16). Following the resignation of Federal Councillor Calonder, Häberlin was elected in the first ballot with 124 out of 159 votes as successor on 12 February 1920.
While in office he was in charge of the Justice and Police Department. During his time in the Federal Council, he was President of the Swiss Confederation in 1926 and 1931.

Häberlin was to a large extent instrumental in the unification of criminal law. Characteristic of his tenure were particularly two rejected laws by the people for the expansion of state security laws, which became known as Lex Häberlin I and II. The purpose of these proposed laws was to protect the civil and democratic state against extremist influences. And in the wake of the rise of Nazism in Germany, he strongly condemned fascist and Nazi totalitarianism based on his democratic-liberal attitude and was warning of the danger of Hitler’s martial aspirations as early as 1932. Moreover, he was highly regarded for his expertise in his chosen field, the sharpness and preciseness of his dialectic skills, wit and humour.

As the President of the Board of Trustees of Pro Juventute, he described the Yenish people as &quot;a dark spot in our proud Swiss culture&quot; in a brochure published in 1927, advocating for their elimination. Dispensaries, teachers, pastors, and non-profit organizations provided support to the foundation. While the legislation provided certain boundaries, these limits were often disregarded, leading to open illegality. With the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Kaiser Karl I. and his wife Zita von Bourbon-Parma went into exile in Switzerland. Kaiser Karl I. gave his word of honor to the Swiss authorities to give notification in case of any intentions of travelling abroad, however, he broke it twice and went to Hungary in a futile attempt to restore the monarchy and to regain power over his lost empire. After that, based on Häberlin’s initiative, the whole family and entourage were no longer granted asylum in Switzerland due to their violation of Swiss asylum law and were asked to leave. Nevertheless, when one of the children of Empress Zita came down with appendectomy and needed to undergo surgery in Zürich, Häberlin granted them visa extensions for the time being.

=== Retirement ===

Even after his retirement he was still much sought after in important matters. He became a board member of one of the biggest Swiss insurance companies Winterthur, and also first president of Pro Helvetia, and was friends and acquaintance with such diverse personalities as the famous German writer Hermann Hesse, and Walter Mittelholzer who was not only a pioneer of Swiss aviation but also one of the first aviation entrepreneurs. Others included the Nobel prize winner for literature Romain Rolland, the Swiss painters Cuno Amiet who is considered a pioneer of modern art in Switzerland and Carl Liner among others.

Häberlin died 1947 in Frauenfeld.

== Anecdotes==

Häberlin´s most famous and interesting client at the time when he practiced law in Weinfelden was certainly the airship inventor Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin (1838–1917). In Häberlin´s diaries an entry can be found from 16 September 1934 in which he writes that Count Zeppelin was among other things his client in manners such as border disputes with the eminent psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger (1881–1966) who was running an exclusive psychiatric clinic nearby, the Sanatorium Bellevue. 
When Häberlin and the Count were discussing business matters in the lounge of the Count´s family estate Schloss Girsberg, it was not rare that they heard the propeller noise of Count Zeppelin’s airship passing by. In moments like these, Count Zeppelin’s attention was drawn away from matters at hand and Häberlin suggested, “Excellency, shall we take a break until the airship has passed?”, upon which Count Zeppelin stood up, went to the window with a smile, saying, “Yes, you are right, Sir.”

In the rare moments of leisurely life, Häberlin found a lot of comfort in mountaineering and one day he took his wife to the beautiful Alpine village of Zermatt and when he was introducing her to the different peaks surrounding it, an American tourist standing nearby overheard his explanations and assumed Häberlin to be a local mountain guide. The American approached and asked politely if it was possible to have him – the President of the Federal Council of Switzerland – as a mountain guide. In his usual manner of being low-key, the president politely explained to the American that he was on a holiday with his wife to show her the natural wonders of the Swiss Alps and thus wasn’t the “mountain guide” the gentlemen had mistaken him to be.

During World War I, Häberlin was a regiment commander and was stationed with his troops in the Swiss Alps. In those days it was strongly prohibited for the soldier in charge of guarding horse carriages to ride on top of the carriage, instead the soldier had the duty to run behind the carriage in case anything fell off during the transportation. Needless to say, the soldier on duty was not too thrilled with this task, especially when the carriage was empty after delivering the goods and still he was not allowed to ride on it. So one day a guard of Häberlin´s regiment sat next to the coachman on the horse carriage on their way back after dropping off their goods at the designated area. They were on a mountainous road which had many turns, when all of a sudden Häberlin appeared out of nowhere and harshly questioned the guard why he was sitting on the coach instead of running alongside it. The flabbergasted soldier answered in all honesty, “Because Colonel, Sir, I noticed you too late!”, upon hearing this, Häberlin started to laugh heartily and let the soldier off due to the guard´s honesty.

<text>The Monmouth Rebellion, also known as the Pitchfork Rebellion, the Revolt of the West or the West Country rebellion, was an attempt to depose James II, who in February 1685 succeeded his brother Charles II as king of England, Scotland and Ireland. A group of dissident Protestants led by James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, eldest illegitimate son of Charles II, opposed James largely due to his Catholicism.

The failure of Parliamentary efforts to exclude James from the succession in 1681 resulted in the 1683 Rye House Plot to assassinate Charles II and James. Monmouth, implicated as a co-conspirator, went into exile in the Dutch Republic. 

On 11 June 1685, Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis in South West England where he had widespread popular support, planning to take control of the area and march on London. His rebellion was coordinated with a simultaneous rising in Scotland led by Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll. In the next few weeks, Monmouth&#x27;s growing army of nonconformists, artisans and farm workers fought a series of skirmishes with local militias and regular soldiers commanded by Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham, and John Churchill. However, his recruits were unable to compete with the regular army and failed to capture the city of Bristol. The rebellion ended with his defeat at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685 by a royal army commanded by Feversham and Churchill.

Monmouth was beheaded for treason on 15 July 1685. Many of his supporters were tried during the Bloody Assizes, led by Judge Jeffreys, and were condemned to death or transportation. James II consolidated his power and reigned until 1688, when he was deposed by another nephew, William III of Orange, in the Glorious Revolution.

==Duke of Monmouth==
Monmouth was an illegitimate son of Charles II. There had been rumours that Charles had married Monmouth&#x27;s mother, Lucy Walter, but no evidence was forthcoming, and Charles always said that he only had one wife, Catherine of Braganza.

Monmouth had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the English Army by his father in 1672 and Captain general in 1678, enjoying some successes in the Netherlands in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, as commander of a British brigade in the French army.

==Context==
The English Civil War had left resentment among some of the population about the monarchy and the penalties which had been imposed on the supporters of the Commonwealth. The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong. Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a &quot;Popish Plot&quot; to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne. The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession. Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles&#x27;s illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth. In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill – which would exclude the King&#x27;s brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession – in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament. Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason.

After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.

==Plan==

The Monmouth rebellion was planned in Holland and coordinated with another rebellion in Scotland led by Archibald Campbell, the Earl of Argyll. Several areas of England were considered as potential locations for rebellion, including Cheshire and Lancashire along with the South West, as these were seen as having the highest number of opponents of the monarchy. Argyll and Monmouth both began their expeditions from Holland, where James&#x27;s nephew and son-in-law, stadtholder William III of Orange, had not detained them or put a stop to their recruitment efforts. Argyll sailed to Scotland and, on arriving there, raised recruits mainly from his own clan, the Campbells, as part of the Scottish revolt. He had previously been involved in the Rye House Plot of 1683.

Another important member of the rebellion was Robert Ferguson, a radical Scottish Presbyterian minister. He was also known as &quot;the plotter&quot;. It was Ferguson who drew up Monmouth&#x27;s proclamation, and he who was most in favour of Monmouth being crowned King. Thomas Hayward Dare was a goldsmith from Taunton and a Whig politician, a man of considerable wealth and influence who had been jailed during a political campaign calling for a new parliament. He was also fined the huge sum of £5,000 for uttering &quot;seditious&quot; words. After his release from jail, he fled to Holland and became the paymaster general to the Rebellion.

To raise the funds for ships and weaponry, Monmouth pawned many of his belongings. His wife Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch, and her mother also pawned their jewellery to hire the Dutch warship &quot;Helderenberg&quot;. Ann Smith, wealthy widow of a London sugar-baker, gave him £1,000.

==From Lyme Regis to Sedgemoor==

On 30 May 1685 Monmouth set sail for South West England, a strongly Protestant region, with three small ships, four light field guns, and 1500 muskets. He landed on 11 June with 82 supporters, including Lord Grey of Warke, Nathaniel Wade, and Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun. They gathered about 300 men on the first day at Lyme Regis in Dorset, where a long statement prepared by Ferguson denounced the king.

King James had previously received intelligence about the impending plot, and the ships leaving Holland, ten days before. He was warned of Monmouth&#x27;s arrival soon after the first landing. The mayor of the town, Gregory Alford, informed the local militia regiments while Samuel Damsell and another customs officer rode from Lyme to London, arriving on 13 June, having ridden . To face Monmouth&#x27;s rebels, John Churchill was given command of the regular foot in the King&#x27;s army, and the honour of leading the campaign passed to the Huguenot Earl of Feversham. It would take a few days to assemble the army and travel from London to the west country, therefore initial defence was left to local militias.
Over the next couple of days volunteers arrived in Lyme offering to serve under Monmouth. By 15 June he had a force in excess of 1,000 men. On 13 June he lost two of his leading supporters when Dare and Fletcher disputed who should ride one of the best horses provided by local supporters. Fletcher shot and killed Dare and was then put under arrest and sent back to the frigate &quot;Helderenberg&quot;. The next day, 40 cavalry and 400 foot soldiers, under the command of Lord Grey and Wade, moved on to the nearby town of Bridport, where they encountered 1,200 men from the local royalist Dorset militia. The skirmish ended in a Royalist victory, with the retreat of Grey and the cavalry followed by Wade with the foot soldiers. Many of the militiamen deserted and joined Monmouth&#x27;s army. Following this confrontation, Lord Albemarle led a royalist force from Exeter towards the forces of the Duke of Somerset, who were approaching Lyme Regis from the opposite direction.

Monmouth learned of the approach of royalist reinforcements and departed, but instead of marching to London, he headed north with his force towards the county of Somerset. On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster, taking the town before the militias could join up. More recruits joined his disorganised force, which was now around 6,000, consisting mostly of nonconformists, artisans, and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks). One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe.

Monmouth again denounced the king in Chard and was the subject of a coronation in Taunton on 20 June 1685, against the wishes of some of his republican supporters such as Wade. The Taunton Corporation was forced to witness the event at sword point outside the White Hart Inn, to encourage the support of the country gentry. In Taunton, Monmouth was joined by many new supporters and formed a new regiment of 800 men. The king&#x27;s force of Dragoons under Churchill continued to close on Monmouth, arriving in Chard on 19 June. With the assistance of the local militias they attempted to stop new recruits arriving in Taunton to join Monmouth. Feversham meanwhile moved with his forces into Bristol, on the assumption that this would be Monmouth&#x27;s next target, and took overall charge of the campaign.

Monmouth and his growing force then continued north to Bridgwater, where he took up residence at Bridgwater Castle on 21 June, Glastonbury (22 June) and on to Shepton Mallet, arriving on 23 June in worsening weather. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy captured Monmouth&#x27;s ships, cutting off any hope of an escape back to the continent. The Royalist forces of Churchill, who was now in Chard, and of Feversham, in Bristol, also received reinforcements who had marched from London.

On 24 June, Monmouth&#x27;s army encamped at Pensford, and a small force skirmished with the Gloucester Militia to take control of Keynsham, a vital crossing point over the River Avon. He made Keynsham Abbey his headquarters there. Monmouth intended to attack the city of Bristol, after London the largest and most important city in England at that time, However, he heard the city had been occupied by Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort. There were inconclusive skirmishes with a force of Life Guards commanded by Feversham. These attacks gave the impression that there was a much larger royalist force in the vicinity than there actually was. Several historians have speculated that if Monmouth had marched as quickly as possible for Bristol at this point, when it was only protected by the Gloucestershire militia, he would probably have been able to take the city and the outcome of the rebellion might have been very different. Once Bristol had been taken, more recruits would have been attracted to the Rebellion and a later march on London would have been possible.

On 26 June, Monmouth moved towards Bath and, arriving on the south side of it, found it had also been occupied by royalist troops. He camped for the night in Philips Norton (now Norton St Philip), where his forces were attacked on the morning of 27 June by the leading elements of Feversham&#x27;s forces, which had now combined into a larger force, but were still awaiting their artillery. Monmouth&#x27;s half-brother Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, led some cavalry, dragoons, and 500 musketeers into the village, where they were surrounded by the rebels and had to hack through hedges to escape. They were rescued by Churchill and withdrew with approximately twenty casualties on each side; however, each side believed that the other had taken greater losses.

Monmouth then marched overnight to Frome, arriving on 28 June. The morale of Monmouth&#x27;s forces started to collapse as news of the failure of the rebellion in Scotland arrived that day, while the makeshift army was camped in Frome. Argyll&#x27;s small force had been involved in minor skirmishes at Greenock and Ellangreig. He took Ardkinglass castle, but after disagreements with key supporters about when and where to fight the royalists commanded by Rosse and William Cleland, his supporters dwindled away and the Scottish rebellion failed.

The rebels planned to go next to Warminster, where there were many nonconformist wool workers, but on 27 June the Wiltshire Militia had marched from Bath to Trowbridge, and on 29 June entered Westbury. Hearing that an army supporting him had gathered near Bridgwater, Monmouth turned back through Shepton Mallet and arrived in Wells on 1 July. His men damaged the Bishop&#x27;s Palace and the west front of Wells Cathedral, tearing lead from the roof to make bullets, breaking the windows, smashing the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabling their horses in the nave.
Feversham aimed to contain the rebels in the South West until the rest of his forces, including three battalions of British mercenaries sent by William III of Orange from Holland arrived. In the light of propaganda suggesting the rebels had an army of 40,000 and that 500 royalist troops had been lost at Norton St Philip, Feversham was ordered to engage Monmouth&#x27;s forces. On 30 June the final parts of Feversham&#x27;s army, including his artillery, arrived and eventually Monmouth was pushed back via Shepton Mallet to the Somerset Levels, where Alfred the Great had found refuge in his conflicts with the Vikings. Becoming hemmed in at Bridgwater on 3 July, he ordered his troops to fortify the town.

==Battle of Sedgemoor==
Monmouth was finally defeated by Feversham with John Churchill, his second in command, on 6 July at the Battle of Sedgemoor.

Once Monmouth&#x27;s force had entered and started to fortify Bridgwater, he sent some of his cavalry to collect six cannon from Minehead. He planned to stay in Bridgwater until they returned and then break out and head for Bristol. Feversham and his army of 500 horse and 1,500 militiamen camped on the edge of Sedgemoor at the village of Westonzoyland. Monmouth could view them from the tower of Church of St Mary and may have inspected them more closely from the Church of St Mary in Chedzoy, before deciding to attack them.

The Duke eventually led his untrained and ill-equipped troops out of Bridgwater at around 10:00 pm to undertake a night-time attack on the King&#x27;s army. They were guided by Richard Godfrey, the servant of a local farmer, along the old Bristol road towards Bawdrip. With their limited cavalry in the vanguard, they turned south along Bradney Lane and Marsh Lane and came to the open moor with its deep and dangerous rhynes (drainage ditches).
There was a delay while the rhyne was crossed and the first men across startled a royalist patrol. A shot was fired and a horseman from the patrol galloped off to report to Feversham. Lord Grey of Warke led the rebel cavalry forward and they were engaged by the King&#x27;s Regiment of Horse which alerted the rest of the royalist forces. The superior training of the regular army and their horses routed the rebel forces by outflanking them. His untrained supporters were quickly defeated by the professionals, and hundreds were cut down by cannon- and musket-fire.

The death count on the rebel side has variously been given as between 727 and 2,700, with royalist losses of 27 who were buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Westonzoyland, which was used as a prison for rebel soldiers.

==After Sedgemoor==
Monmouth fled from the field of battle, but was captured in a ditch on 8 July (either at Ringwood in the New Forest, or at Horton in Dorset). Parliament had passed an Act of Attainder, on 13 June sentencing Monmouth to death as a traitor, therefore no trial was needed before his execution. Despite begging for mercy and claims of conversion to Roman Catholicism, he was beheaded at Tower Hill by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685. It is said that it took multiple blows of the axe to sever his head. Though some sources say it took eight blows, the official Tower of London website says it took five blows, while Charles Spencer, in his book &quot;Blenheim&quot;, claims it was seven. The Hangman in &#x27;Punch and Judy&#x27; is named after this notorious character, Jack Ketch. His dukedoms of Monmouth and Buccleuch were forfeited, though his wife&#x27;s separate dukedom of Buccleuch in her own right was not, and two of his subsidiary titles were restored in 1743 to his grandson the then Duke of Buccleuch.
The subsequent Bloody Assizes of Judge Jeffreys were a series of trials of Monmouth&#x27;s supporters in which 320 people were condemned to death and around 800 sentenced to be transported to the West Indies, for ten years&#x27; hard labour.

James II took advantage of the suppression of the rebellion to consolidate his power. He asked Parliament to repeal the Test Act and the Habeas Corpus Act, used his dispensing power to appoint Roman Catholics to senior posts, and raised the strength of the standing army. Parliament opposed many of these moves, and on 20 November 1685 James dismissed it. In 1688, when the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart heralded a Catholic succession, James II was deposed by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution at the invitation of the disaffected Protestant Establishment.

==Literary references==
The Monmouth Rebellion and the events surrounding it have formed the basis for several works of fiction. 
* John Dryden&#x27;s work &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; is a satire partially concerned with equating biblical events with the Monmouth Rebellion. 
* It also plays an important role in R. D. Blackmore&#x27;s novel &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;. In &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;, Richard Doddridge Blackmore&#x27;s romantic novel of 1869, Farmer John Ridd rescues his brother-in-law Tom Faggus from the battlefield of Sedgemoor, but is captured as a rebel, and is brought before Judge Jefferies.
* Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Micah Clarke&quot; deals directly with Monmouth&#x27;s landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed. 
* The Monmouth Rebellion plays a key role in Peter S. Beagle&#x27;s novel &quot;Tamsin&quot;, about a 300-year-old ghost who is befriended by the protagonist. 
* Several characters in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s trilogy &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;, particularly &quot;Quicksilver&quot; and &quot;The Confusion&quot;, play a role in the Monmouth Rebellion and its aftermath.
* Another novel, of 1889, covering the events of the Rebellion was Sir Walter Besant&#x27;s &quot;For Faith and Freedom&quot;. 
* John Masefield&#x27;s 1910 novel &quot;Martin Hyde: The Duke&#x27;s Messenger&quot; tells the story of a boy who plays a central part in the Monmouth Rebellion, from the meeting with Argyll in Holland to the failed rebellion itself. 
* Dr. Peter Blood, main hero of Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Captain Blood&quot;, was sentenced by Judge Jeffreys for aiding wounded Monmouth rebels. Transported to the Caribbean, he started his career as a pirate there. 
* Another of Sabatini&#x27;s novels, &quot;Mistress Wilding&quot;, also takes place during this time, as the hero, Anthony Wilding, is a supporter of Monmouth. 
* &quot;The Royal Changeling&quot;, (1998), by John Whitbourn, describes the rebellion with some fantasy elements added, from the viewpoint of Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe.
* The events immediately before and after the Battle of Sedgemoor, and leading up to James II&#x27;s exile following The Glorious Revolution provide the setting for Robert Neill&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Lilliburlero&quot;. 
* The aftermath of the Rebellion is the setting for A.E.W. Mason&#x27;s 1896 novel &quot;The Courtship of Morrice Buckler&quot;.

<text>The Bloody Assizes were a series of trials started at Winchester on 25 August 1685 in the aftermath of the Battle of Sedgemoor, which ended the Monmouth Rebellion in England.

==History==
There were five judges: Sir William Montague (Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer), Sir Robert Wright, Sir Francis Wythens (Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench), Sir Creswell Levinz (Justice of the Common Pleas) and Sir Henry Pollexfen, led by Lord Chief Justice George Jeffreys.

Over 1,000 rebels were in prison awaiting the trials, which started in the Great Hall of Winchester Castle in Winchester on 26 August. The first notable trial was that of an elderly gentlewoman named Dame Alice Lisle. The jury reluctantly found her guilty and, the law recognising no distinction between principals and accessories in treason, she was sentenced to be burned. This was commuted to beheading, with the sentence being carried out in Winchester market-place on 2 September 1685.

From Winchester the court proceeded through the West Country, and conducted a brief hearing in Salisbury, where there were no rebels to be tried for high treason, on 1 September 1685. The court went on to the main centres of rebellion holding assizes at the Antelope Hotel in Dorchester on 5 September 1685, Exeter Guildhall on 14 September 1685 and the Great Hall of Taunton Castle on 17 September 1685, before finishing up at Wells Market and Assize Hall on 23 September 1685. More than 1,400 prisoners were dealt with and although most were sentenced to death, fewer than 300 were hanged or hanged, drawn and quartered. Of more than 500 prisoners brought before the court at Taunton between 17 and 19 September, 144 were hanged and their remains displayed around the county to ensure people understood the fate of those who rebelled against the king.

Some 800–850 men were transported to the West Indies where they were worth more alive than dead as a source of cheap labour (the novel &quot;Captain Blood&quot;, and the later movies based on it, graphically portray this punishment). Others were imprisoned to await further trial, although many did not live long enough, succumbing to &#x27;Gaol Fever&#x27; (typhus), which was rife in the unsanitary conditions common to most English gaols at that time. A woman named Elizabeth Gaunt had the distinction of being the last woman burnt alive in England for political crimes.

Jeffreys returned to London after the Assizes to report to King James, who rewarded him by making him Lord Chancellor (at the age of only 40), &#x27;For the many eminent and faithful services to the Crown&#x27;. Jeffreys became known as &quot;the hanging judge&quot;.

After the Glorious Revolution, Jeffreys was incarcerated in the Tower of London, where he died in 1689. His death was probably due to his chronic medical history of kidney and bladder stones leading to an acute infection, kidney failure and possibly toxaemia.

Writing as recently as 1929, Sir John C. Fox said:
Even to the present day, the mothers of West Somerset control their unruly offspring by threatening to send for &#x27;Judge Jeffreys&#x27;.

<text>Carl Spitzweg (February 5, 1808 – September 23, 1885) was a German romantic painter, especially of genre subjects. He is considered to be one of the most important artists of the Biedermeier era.

==Life and career==

Spitzweg was born in Unterpfaffenhofen, near Munich, Bavaria, the second of three sons of Franziska (née Schmutzer) and Simon Spitzweg. His mother belonged to Munich&#x27;s upper middle class as the daughter of a wealthy fruit wholesaler. The family&#x27;s property at Neuhausergasse (today: Neuhauser Straße) 14 was a stately property that later gave Carl Spitzweg financial independence through his inheritance. Carl&#x27;s father came from the village of Unterpfaffenhofen near the town of Fürstenfeldbruck in today&#x27;s Fürstenfeldbruck district (in Upper Bavaria), where his family had become wealthy. Until 1807, Spitzweg&#x27;s father&#x27;s business base was the trade in spices in Munich. His relatives controlled thriving fruit businesses. Simon Spitzweg was an educated businessman who gained respect and reputation in Munich through his political activities. Carl Spitzweg had two brothers whose careers were just as determined by their father as his own. The eldest, Simon, was to take over the business, Carl was to become a pharmacist and the youngest, Eduard, was to become a doctor.

In Munich, he suffered under his strict father, who tried to forbid him from drawing. After his mother died, in 1819, in same year, his father married his late wife&#x27;s sister, Maria Krescence. She took great care of Carl and defended him against his father.

From 1819, Carl Spitzweg attended the Munich college and went through the two Latin preparatory classes and the two preparatory classes with varying degrees of success. He left the high school, today&#x27;s Wilhelmsgymnasium Munich, in 1824, after the second (of four) high school years.

Although his artistic talent was early, with his first drawing from 1823, Carl Spitzweg was obedient to his father and began his apprenticeship in the “city pharmacy” with Sigmund Lober in February 1825. On December 1, 1828, during the last year of his apprenticeship, his father died.

In 1829 he worked in the “Löwenapotheke” in the city of Straubing. He lived there for a year, and was acquainted with theater people and painters. The same year, his eldest brother died working as a merchant in Alexandria, Egypt.

Spitzweg began studying pharmacy, botany and chemistry at the University of Munich in 1830, which he completed with honors in 1832. He was now licensed as a practicing pharmacist. In 1833, Spitzweg gave up his career as a pharmacist. During a spa stay in Bad Sulz, Peißenberg, after an illness, he decided to devote himself to painting in a full-time level. The decision was made easier by the fact that he received the share of his inheritance at this time.

Spitzweg was self-taught as an artist, starting by copying the works of Flemish masters. He contributed with his first work to satiric magazines. In 1835, he became a member of the Munich Art Association. This was followed by trips to Dalmatia (1839), Venice (1850), and, in the company of the landscape painter Eduard Schleich, to Paris, London, where they visited the first world exhibition, in 1851. On the way back home, he also visited Antwerp (1851), Frankfurt am Main and Heidelberg.

Spitzweg spent his travels to these European cities studying the works of various artists and refining his technique and style. His later paintings and drawings are often humorous genre works. Many of his paintings depict sharply characterized eccentrics, for example &quot;The Bookworm (1850)&quot; and &quot;The Hypochondriac&quot; (c. 1865, in the Neue Pinakothek, Munich).

Since 1844 he was an employee of the weekly magazine &quot;Fliegenden Blätter&quot;, where he published numerous humorous drawings.

Spitzweg died of a stroke, shortly after the death of his younger brother, on September 23, 1885, at the age of 77. He was found dead in his Munich apartment. He was buried in the Alter Südfriedhof, in Munich.

==Artwork==
Spitzweg created over 1,500 pictures and drawings. Since 1824 he began painting with oil paints. During his lifetime, he was able to sell around four hundred paintings. He found admirers and buyers primarily among the citizens who had gained new purchasing power.

His painting style belongs to the late romantic period. Initially Spitzweg was associated with the Biedermeier style, but later his style of painting became more relaxed and closer to impressionism. Spitzweg drew a lot in his youth. Even while working in the pharmacy, he drew the heads of real and imaginary sick people, young and old, as well as the people from the small town of Straubing. What Spitzweg particularly appreciated about this idyllic town was the picturesque small townscape with the narrow streets and graceful bay windows, the turrets, fountains and stone figures. These motifs will appear often in his paintings.

Spitzweg depicted people in their contemporary bourgeois milieu. In his small format paintings, he depicts the Biedermeier petty bourgeoisie, the oddball eccentrics and romantic events. He did represent human weaknesses, but not the wicked or the mean: anything coarse was alien to Spitzweg. &quot;The Poor Poet&quot;, Spitzweg&#x27;s best-known and most popular work, dates from 1839. In &quot;The Cactus Lover&quot;, Spitzweg shows the office worker in front of his favorite plant. Paintings such as &quot;At the Antiquary&quot;, &quot;Sentinel at the Gate&quot;, &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, &quot;The Bookworm&quot;, among others, are also representative of his style.

Through his friendship with the landscape painter Eduard Schleich, with whom he traveled many times, he became more aware of the landscape. With a sense of nature and color, he painted grandiose mountain massifs and their open expanses, romantic forest corners, the green plateaus with forests, meadows and harvest fields, mostly in good weather, because he preferred to depict the light.

Spitzweg had a keen sense of color. Through his pharmacist training, he gained chemical and technical experience in the production of his paints. He used a unique, bright shade of blue that cannot be found in any other painter. He also knew how to produce lasting colors. From his long travels, Spitzweg brought home a rich collection of sketches, which he used to create his paintings in the studio.

==Forgeries==
In the late 1930s an art forgery case in Germany involved 54 paintings which had been passed off as Spitzweg originals. They had been painted by a Traunstein copyist named Toni, who worked from reproductions and picture postcards. Toni signed the works &quot;in the style of Spitzweg&quot; with his own name, but fraudsters later removed his name and artificially aged the paintings in order to sell them as originals. At the Stuttgart Criminal Court Assizes, the conspirators were jailed for up to ten years for the swindle.

==Looted works==
Adolf Hitler was a fan of Spitzweg&#x27;s work; he claimed to have acquired the world&#x27;s finest collection of Spitzwegs.

&quot;Playing Piano&quot;, an etching by Spitzweg, was found as part of the Munich Art Hoard.

==Cultural references==
His paintings inspired the musical comedy &quot;Das kleine Hofkonzert&quot; (1933), by Edmund Nick, who itself was later adapted into several films.

<text>Below is a list of presidents of the Swiss Confederation (1848–present). It presents the presiding member of the Swiss Federal Council, the country&#x27;s seven-member executive.

Elected by the Federal Assembly for one year, the President of the Confederation chairs the meetings of the Federal Council and undertakes special representational duties. &quot;Primus inter pares&quot;, the officeholder has no powers above the other Federal Councillors and continues to head his or her department. Traditionally, the duty rotates among the members in order of seniority and the previous year&#x27;s vice president becomes president.

<text>The Courts of England and Wales, supported administratively by His Majesty&#x27;s Courts and Tribunals Service, are the civil and criminal courts responsible for the administration of justice in England and Wales.

Except in constitutional matters, committed to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom does not generally have a single unified legal system—England and Wales have one system, Scotland another, and Northern Ireland a third. There are additional exceptions to this rule; for example, in immigration law, the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal&#x27;s jurisdiction covers the whole of the United Kingdom, while in employment law, there is a single system of employment tribunals for England, Wales, and Scotland but not Northern Ireland. Additionally, the Military Court Service has jurisdiction over all members of the armed forces of the United Kingdom in relation to offences against military law.

The Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Crown Court, the County Court, and the magistrates&#x27; courts are administered by His Majesty&#x27;s Courts and Tribunals Service, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice.

There have been multiple calls from both Welsh academics and politicians for a Wales criminal justice system.

==Supreme Court of the United Kingdom==
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest appeal court in almost all cases in England and Wales. Before the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 this role was held by the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. The Supreme Court is also the highest court of appeal for devolution matters, a role previously held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
The Supreme Court has a separate administration from the other courts of England and Wales, and its administration is under a Chief Executive who is appointed by the President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.

==Senior Courts of England and Wales==

The Senior Courts of England and Wales were originally created by the Judicature Acts as the &quot;Supreme Court of Judicature&quot;. It was renamed the &quot;Supreme Court of England and Wales&quot; in 1981, and again to the &quot;Senior Courts of England and Wales&quot; by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (to distinguish it from the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom). It consists of the following courts:

*Court of Appeal (formally His Majesty&#x27;s Court of Appeal in England)
*High Court of Justice (High Court, formally His Majesty&#x27;s High Court of Justice in England)
*Crown Court

The Senior Courts of England and Wales, along with the Tribunals and other courts, are administered and supported by HM Courts and Tribunals Service.

===Court of Appeal ===

The Court of Appeal deals only with appeals from other courts or tribunals. The Court of Appeal consists of two divisions: the Civil Division hears appeals from the High Court and the County Court and certain superior tribunals, while the Criminal Division may only hear appeals from the Crown Court connected with a trial on indictment (i.e., for a serious offence). Its decisions are binding on all courts, including itself, apart from the Supreme Court.

===High Court===

The High Court of Justice functions both as a civil court of first instance and a criminal and civil appellate court for cases from the subordinate courts. It consists of three divisions: the King&#x27;s Bench, the Chancery, and the Family divisions. The divisions of the High Court are not separate courts but have somewhat separate procedures and practices adapted to their purposes. Although particular kinds of cases will be assigned to each division depending on their subject matter, each division may exercise the jurisdiction of the High Court. This also means English High Court puisne judges and above can sit &#x27;cross-bench&#x27; meaning they can hear matters normally assigned to another division should they so desire. However, beginning proceedings in the wrong division may result in a cost penalty.

The formation of the Business and Property Courts of England &amp; Wales within the High Court was announced in March 2017, and launched in London in July 2017. The courts are based in the Rolls Building, where there are 31 courts and three super courts able to handle the most complex and multi-party trials. There are regional High Court centres at the civil and family courts in the major cities. The Business and Property Courts administer the specialist jurisdictions that had previously been administered in the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division under the names of the Admiralty Court, the Commercial Court, and the Technology &amp; Construction Court, and under the Chancery Division&#x27;s lists for Business, Insolvency and Companies, Competition, Intellectual Property, Revenue, and Property, Trusts and Probate. In 2015, the Financial List was created &quot;for financial claims of £50 million or more, or cases that raise issues concerning the domestic and international financial markets: the equity, derivatives, FX and commodities markets.&quot; There are also Regional Business and Property Courts.

The judicial expertise available in the Rolls Building includes asset recovery, banking, commodities, company law, construction, finance, fraud, insolvency and reconstruction. It also covers information technology, insurance, intellectual property (including patents), international trade, mining, oil and gas, partnership, property, public procurement, regulation, shipping, tax and trusts. All matters in this list are heard by judges with particular experience in determining disputes in their particular speciality.

===Crown Court ===
The Crown Court is a criminal court of both original and appellate jurisdiction which in addition handles a limited amount of civil business both at first instance and on appeal. It was established by the Courts Act 1971. It replaced the assizes whereby High Court judges would periodically travel around the country hearing cases, and quarter sessions which were courts held periodically in counties, county boroughs and certain boroughs. The Old Bailey is the unofficial name of London&#x27;s most famous criminal court, which is now part of the Crown Court. Its official name is the Central Criminal Court. The Crown Court also hears appeals from magistrates&#x27; courts.

The Crown Court is the only court in England and Wales that has the jurisdiction to try cases on indictment, and when exercising such a role, it is a superior court in that its judgments cannot be reviewed by the Administrative Court of the King&#x27;s Bench Division of the High Court.

The Crown Court is an inferior court in respect of the other work it undertakes, namely among other things, appeals from the magistrates&#x27; courts and other tribunals.

==Subordinate courts==

The most common subordinate courts in England and Wales are

* County Court
* Family Court
* Magistrates&#x27; courts
* Youth courts

===County Court===

The County Court is a national court with a purely civil jurisdiction, sitting in 92 different towns and cities across England and Wales. As of 22 April 2014 there has been a single County Court for England and Wales where previously there was a series of courts. The County Court is so named after the ancient sheriff&#x27;s court held in each county, but it has no connection with it nor indeed was the jurisdiction of the county courts based on counties.

A County Court hearing is presided over by either a district or circuit judge and, except in a small minority of cases such as civil actions against the police, the judge sits alone as a trier of fact and law without assistance from a jury. The old county courts&#x27; divorce and family jurisdiction was passed on 22 April 2014 to the single Family Court.

Until unification in 2014, county courts were local courts in the sense that each one has an area over which certain kinds of jurisdiction, for example, proceedings for possession of the land had to be started in the county court in whose district the property lay, but in general, any county court in England and Wales could hear any action and claims were frequently transferred from court to court.

===Family Court===

The Family Court is a national court and has jurisdiction to hear all family cases in England and Wales. Local jurisdictional boundaries have disappeared and there is only one single jurisdiction for all family proceedings. The Family Court sits at many locations in England and Wales, and it usually sits at the County Court centres and magistrates courts where family work was previously heard by county courts or family proceedings courts. Family Court judges are now more categories of judges who will be eligible to hear family cases including lay magistrates, district judges, circuit judges, and High Court judges from the Family Division.

===Magistrates&#x27; and youth courts===
Magistrates&#x27; courts are local criminal courts, where all criminal proceedings start. They are presided over by a bench of magistrates (A.K.A. justices of the peace), or a legally trained district judge (formerly known as a stipendiary magistrate), sitting in each local justice area. There are no juries. They have jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases, as well as certain licensing appeals. Youth courts are run on similar lines to adult magistrates&#x27; courts but deal with offenders aged between the ages of ten and seventeen inclusive. Youth courts are presided over by a specially trained subset of experienced adult magistrates or a district judge. Youth magistrates have a wider catalog of disposals available to them for dealing with young offenders and often hear more serious cases against youths (which for adults would normally be dealt with by the Crown Court). Youth courts are not open to the public for observation, only the parties involved in a case being admitted.

Prior to the enactment of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, some magistrates&#x27; courts were also a family proceedings court and heard family law cases including care cases and they had the power to make adoption orders. Family cases are no longer heard by the magistrates&#x27; courts, instead being heard by the single Family Court established by the 2013 Act.

==Special courts and tribunals==
In addition, there are many other specialist courts. These are often described as &quot;tribunals&quot; rather than courts, but the difference in name is meaningless. For example, an employment tribunal is an inferior court of record for the purposes of the law of contempt of court. In many cases, there is a statutory right of appeal from a tribunal to a particular court or specially constituted appellate tribunal. In the absence of a specific appeals court, the only remedy from a decision of a tribunal may be via judicial review to the High Court, which will often be more limited in scope than an appeal.

Examples of specialist courts are:
* Employment tribunals (formerly industrial tribunals) with an appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal
* the Employment Appeal Tribunal, which is a superior court of record, and therefore not subject to judicial review, appeals go to the Court of Appeal
* the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal established under the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 have absorbed the function of many pre-existing tribunals.

===Coroners&#x27; courts===
The post of coroner is ancient, dating from the 11th century, and coroners still sit today to determine the cause of death in situations where people have died in potentially suspicious circumstances, abroad, or in the care of central authority. They also have jurisdiction over treasure trove.

===Ecclesiastical courts===
The Church of England is an established church (i.e. it is the official state church) and formerly had exclusive or non-exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over marriage and divorce cases, testamentary matters, defamation, and several other areas. Since the 19th century, the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts has narrowed principally to matters of church property and errant clergy. Each diocese has a &quot;chancellor&quot; (either a barrister or solicitor) who acts as a judge in the consistory court of the diocese. The bishop no longer has the right to preside personally, as he formerly did. Appeals lie to the Arches Court (in Canterbury) and the Chancery Court (in York), and from them to the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved (CECR). From the CECR appeals lie to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

===Military courts===
Military courts of the United Kingdom include
* the Summary Appeal Court
* the Service Civilian Court
* the Court Martial
* the Court Martial Appeal Court

===Other courts===
*Election court (ad-hoc courts hearing petitions against election results)
*Barmote court (largely ceremonial court dealing with lead mining rights in Derbyshire)
*The High Court of Chivalry (ancient and rarely convened court dealing with heraldry)
*Verderers&#x27; courts (dealing with commoners&#x27; rights and related matters in the formerly royal hunting forests of the New Forest, the Forest of Dean and Epping Forest)
*The Court leet of Laxton (deals with the open-field system of farming in Laxton)

==Criminal cases==

There are two kinds of criminal trials: &quot;summary&quot; and &quot;on indictment&quot;. For an adult, summary trials take place in a magistrates&#x27; court, while trials on indictment take place in the Crown Court. Despite the possibility of two venues for trial, almost all criminal cases, however serious, commence in a magistrates&#x27; courts. It is possible to start a trial for an indictable offence by a voluntary bill of indictment, and go directly to the Crown Court, but that would be unusual.

A criminal case that starts in the magistrates&#x27; courts may begin either by the defendant being charged and then being brought forcibly before magistrates or by a summons to the defendant to appear on a certain day before the magistrates. A summons is usually confined to very minor offences. The hearing (of the charge or summons) before the magistrates is known as a &quot;first appearance&quot;.

Offences are of three categories: indictable only, summary, and either way. Indictable only offences such as murder and rape must be tried on indictment in the Crown Court. On first appearance, the magistrates must immediately refer the defendant to the Crown Court for trial, their only role being to decide whether to remand the defendant on bail or in custody.

Summary offences, such as most motoring offences, are much less serious and most must be tried in a magistrates&#x27; court, although a few may be sent for trial to the Crown Court along with other offences that may be tried there (for example assault). The vast majority of offences are also concluded in a magistrates&#x27; court (over 90% of cases).

Either way offences are intermediate offences such as theft and, with the exception of low-value criminal damage, maybe tried either summarily (by magistrates) or by judge and jury in the Crown Court. If the magistrates consider that an either way offence is too serious for them to deal with, they may &quot;decline jurisdiction&quot; which means that the defendant will have to appear in the Crown Court. Conversely, even if the magistrates accept jurisdiction, an adult defendant has a right to compel a jury trial. Defendants under eighteen years of age do not have this right and will be tried in a youth court (similar to a magistrates&#x27; court) unless the case is homicide or else is particularly serious.

A magistrates&#x27; court is made up in two ways. Either a group (known as a &quot;bench&quot;) of &quot;lay magistrates&quot;, or a district judge, will hear the case. A bench must consist of either two or three magistrates. Alternatively, a case may be heard by a district judge (formerly known as a stipendiary magistrate), who will be a qualified lawyer and will sit singly, but has the same powers as a lay bench. District judges usually sit in the more busy courts in cities or hear complex cases (e.g. extradition). Magistrates and District Judges have the same limited sentencing powers.

In the Crown Court, the case is tried before a recorder (part-time judge), circuit judge or a High Court judge, and a jury. The seniority of the judge depends on the seriousness and complexity of the case. The jury is involved only if the defendant enters a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot;.

==Appeals==

From the magistrates&#x27; courts, an appeal can be taken to the Crown Court on matters of fact and law or, on matters of law alone, to the Administrative Court of King&#x27;s Bench Division of the High Court, which is called an appeal &quot;by way of case stated&quot;. The magistrates&#x27; courts are also inferior courts and are therefore subject to judicial review.

The Crown Court is more complicated. When it is hearing a trial on indictment (a jury trial) it is treated as a superior court, which means that its decisions may not be judicially reviewed and appeal lies only to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal.

In other circumstances (for example when acting as an appeal court from a magistrates&#x27; court) the Crown Court is an inferior court, which means that it is subject to judicial review. When acting as an inferior court, appeals by way of case stated on matters of law may be made to the Administrative Court.

Appeals from the High Court, in criminal matters, lie only to the Supreme Court. Appeals from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) may also only be taken to the Supreme Court.

Appeals to the Supreme Court are unusual in that the court from which appeal is being made (either the High Court or the Court of Appeal) must certify that there is a point of law of general public importance. This additional control mechanism is not present with civil appeals and means that far fewer criminal appeals are heard by the Supreme Court.

==Civil cases==

Under the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, civil claims under £10,000 are dealt with in the County Court under the &quot;small claims track&quot;. This is generally known to the lay public as &quot;small claims court&quot; but does not exist as a separate court. Claims between £10,000 and £25,000 that are capable of being tried within one day are allocated to the &quot;fast track&quot; and claims over £25,000 to the &quot;multi-track&quot;. These &quot;tracks&quot; are labels for the use of the court system – the actual cases will be heard in the County Court or the High Court depending on their value.

For personal injury, defamation cases, and in some landlord and tenant disputes, the thresholds for each track have different values.

==History==
For nearly 300 years, from the time of the Norman Conquest until 1362, French was the language of the courts, rather than English. Until the twentieth century, many legal terms were still expressed in Latin.
The Supreme Court of Judicature was formed in 1875 from the merging of various courts then existing, such as the
*Court of King&#x27;s Bench
*High Court of Chancery
*Court of Exchequer
*High Court of Admiralty
*Court of Common Pleas
*Court of Probate and Matrimonial Causes
*Court of Common Pleas of the County Palatine of Lancaster
*Court of Pleas of the County Palatine of Durham and Sadberge

The Court of Appeal in Chancery was merged into the Court of Appeal.

Other historical courts include:
*House of Lords
*Star Chamber
*Court of High Commission
*Court of Criminal Appeal
*Court for Crown Cases Reserved
*Courts of piepowders (marketplace courts)
*Assize Court
*Restrictive Practices Court
*Courts leet
*Quarter sessions

===Local courts of special jurisdiction===
The courts of session of the County Palatine of Chester and the Principality of Wales were abolished section 14 of by the Law Terms Act 1830.

The Court of the County of Durham was abolished by section 2 of the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836.

The Stannaries Court was abolished by the Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896.

The following courts were merged into the High Court by section 41 of the Courts Act 1971 following the report by Dr. Beeching:
*The Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Lancaster
*The Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Durham and Sadberge

Section 42 replaced the Mayor&#x27;s and City of London Court with a county court of the same name.

Section 43 abolished:
*The Tolzey and Pie Poudre Courts of the City and County of Bristol
*The Liverpool Court of Passage
*The Norwich Guildhall Court
*The Court of Record for the Hundred of Salford

Section 221 of the Local Government Act 1972 abolished the borough civil courts listed in Schedule 28 to that Act.

Part II of Schedule 4 to the Administration of Justice Act 1977 curtailed the jurisdiction of certain other anomalous local courts.

<doc id="240540" wikidata="Q180468" url="?curid=240540" title="Albert Szent-Györgyi">
<text>Albert Imre Szent-Györgyi de Nagyrápolt (; September 16, 1893 – October 22, 1986) was a Hungarian biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1937. He is credited with first isolating vitamin C and discovering many of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle and the molecular basis of muscle contraction. He was also active in the Hungarian Resistance during World War II, and entered Hungarian politics after the war.

==Early life==
Szent-Györgyi was born in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, on September 16, 1893. His father, Miklós Szent-Györgyi, was a landowner, born in Marosvásárhely, Transylvania (today Târgu Mureş, Romania), a Calvinist, and could trace his ancestry back to 1608 when Sámuel, a Calvinist , was ennobled. At the time of Szent-Györgyi&#x27;s birth, being of the nobility was considered important and created opportunities that otherwise were not available. (Miklós Szent-Györgyi&#x27;s parents were Imre Szent-Györgyi and Mária Csiky). His mother, Jozefina, a Roman Catholic, was a daughter of József Lenhossék and Anna Bossányi. Jozefina was a sister of Mihály Lenhossék; both of these men were Professors of Anatomy at the Eötvös Loránd University. His family included three generations of scientists. Music was important in the Lenhossék family. His mother Jozefina prepared to become an opera singer and auditioned for Gustav Mahler, then a conductor at the Budapest Opera. He advised her to marry instead, since her voice was not enough. Albert himself was good at the piano, while his brother Pál became a professional violinist.

==Education==

Szent-Györgyi began his studies at the Semmelweis University in 1911, and then began research in his uncle&#x27;s anatomy lab. His studies were interrupted in 1914 to serve as an army medic in World War I. In 1916, disgusted with the war, Szent-Györgyi shot himself in the arm, claimed to be wounded from enemy fire, and was sent home on medical leave. He was then able to finish his medical education and received his MD in 1917. He married Kornélia Demény, the daughter of the Hungarian Postmaster General, that same year.

After the war, Szent-Györgyi began his research career in Pozsony (today Bratislava, Slovakia). He switched universities several times over the next few years, finally ending up at the University of Groningen, where his work focused on the chemistry of cellular respiration. This work landed him a position as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow at the University of Cambridge. He received his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1929 where he was a student at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His research involved isolating an organic acid, which he then called &quot;hexuronic acid&quot;, from adrenal gland tissue.

==Career and research==
Szent-Györgyi accepted a position at the University of Szeged in Hungary in 1930. There Szent-Györgyi and his research fellow Joseph Svirbely found that &quot;hexuronic acid&quot; was actually the long-sought antiscorbutic factor, henceforth known as vitamin C. After Walter Norman Haworth had determined its structure, the antiscorbutic was given the formal chemical name of L-ascorbic acid. In some experiments they used paprika as the source for their vitamin C. Also during this time, Szent-Györgyi continued his work on cellular respiration, identifying fumaric acid and other steps in what would become known as the Krebs cycle. In Szeged he also met Zoltán Bay, a physicist who became his friend and research partner in bio-physics.

In 1937 he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for his discoveries in connection with the biological combustion process with special reference to vitamin C and the catalysis of fumaric acid&quot;. Albert Szent-Györgyi offered all of his Nobel prize money to Finland in 1940. (Hungarian volunteers in the Winter War travelled to fight for the Finns after the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939.)

In 1938 he began work on the biophysics of muscle movement. He found that muscles contain actin, which when combined with the protein myosin and the energy source ATP, contract muscle fibers. In 1946, Albert received the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.

In 1947 Szent-Györgyi established the Institute for Muscle Research at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MLB) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts with financial support from Hungarian businessman Stephen Rath. However, he still faced funding difficulties for several years due to his foreign status and former association with the Hungarian Communist government. In 1948, he received a research position with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland and began dividing his time between there and Woods Hole. In 1950, grants from the Armour Meat Company and the American Heart Association allowed him to establish the Institute for Muscle Research at Woods Hole. Szent-Györgyi conducted research at the MBL from 1947 to 1986 year-round. There, he found that whole muscle tissue retained its contractility almost indefinitely if stored cold in a fifty percent glycerol solution, thus eliminating the need to have fresh muscle on hand.

During the 1950s Szent-Györgyi began using electron microscopes to study muscles at the subunit level. He received the Lasker Award in 1954. In 1955, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1956.

In 1941, Szent-Györgyi developed a research interest in cancer and developed ideas on applying the theories of quantum mechanics to the biochemistry (quantum biology) of cancer. The death of Rath, who had acted as the financial administrator of the Institute for Muscle Research, left Szent-Györgyi in a financial mess. He refused to write government grant proposals minutely specifiying his research methods and expected results. After Szent-Györgyi commented on his financial hardships in a 1971 newspaper interview, attorney Franklin Salisbury helped him establish a private nonprofit organization, the National Foundation for Cancer Research. Late in life, Szent-Györgyi began to pursue free radicals as a potential cause of cancer. He came to see cancer as being ultimately an electronic problem at the molecular level. In 1974, reflecting his interests in quantum physics, he proposed the term &quot;syntropy&quot; to replace &quot;negentropy&quot;. Ralph Moss, a protégé during his cancer research years, wrote a biography, &quot;Free Radical: Albert Szent-Gyorgyi and the Battle over Vitamin C.&quot; Aspects of his work are an important precursor to the understanding of redox signaling.

===Statement on scientific discovery===

Albert Szent-Györgyi, who realized that &quot;a discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge,&quot; divided scientists into two categories: the Apollonians and the Dionysians. He called Dionysians the scientific dissenters who explore &quot;the fringes of knowledge&quot;. He wrote, &quot;In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find. Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian.&quot;

===Involvement in politics===

As the government of Gyula Gömbös and the associated Hungarian National Defence Association gained control of politics in Hungary, Szent-Györgyi helped his Jewish friends escape from the country. During World War II, he joined the Hungarian resistance movement. Although Hungary was allied with the Axis Powers, the Hungarian prime minister Miklós Kállay sent Szent-Györgyi to Istanbul in 1944 under the guise of a scientific lecture to begin secret negotiations with the Allies. The Germans learned of this plot and Adolf Hitler himself issued a warrant for the arrest of Szent-Györgyi. He escaped from house arrest and spent 1944 to 1945 as a fugitive from the Gestapo.

After the war, Szent-Györgyi had become well-recognized as a public figure and there was some speculation that he might become President of Hungary, should the Soviets permit it. Szent-Györgyi established a laboratory at the University of Budapest and became head of the biochemistry department there. He was elected a member of Parliament and helped re-establish the Academy of Sciences. Dissatisfied with the Communist rule of Hungary, he emigrated to the United States in 1947.

In 1967, Szent-Györgyi signed a letter declaring his intention to refuse to pay taxes as a means of protesting against the U.S. war against Vietnam, and urging other people to take a similar stand.

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

<doc id="240542" wikidata="Q1302120" url="?curid=240542" title="History of Siberia">
<text>The early history of Siberia was greatly influenced by the sophisticated nomadic civilizations of the Scythians (Pazyryk) on the west of the Ural Mountains and Xiongnu (Noin-Ula) on the east of the Urals, both flourishing before the common era. The steppes of Siberia were occupied by a succession of nomadic peoples, including the Khitan people, various Turkic peoples, and the Mongol Empire. In the Late Middle Ages, Tibetan Buddhism spread into the areas south of Lake Baikal.

During the Russian Empire, Siberia was chiefly developed as an agricultural province. The government also used it as a place of exile, sending Avvakum, Dostoevsky, and the Decemberists, among others, to work camps in the region. During the 19th century, the Trans-Siberian Railway was constructed, supporting industrialization. This was also aided by discovery and exploitation of vast reserves of Siberian mineral resources.

==Prehistory and antiquity==

According to the field of genetic genealogy, people first resided in Siberia by 45,000 BCE and spread out east and west to populate Europe and the Americas, including the prehistoric Jomon people of Japan, who are the ancestors of the modern Ainu.

According to Vasily Radlov, among the Paleo-Siberian inhabitants of Central Siberia were the Yeniseians, who spoke a language different from the later Uralic and Turkic people. The Kets are considered the last remainder of this early migration. Migrants are estimated to have crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America more than 20,000 years ago.

The shores of all Siberian lakes, which filled the depressions during the Lacustrine period, abound in remains dating from the Neolithic age. Countless &quot;kurgans&quot; (tumuli), furnaces, and other archaeological artifacts bear witness to a dense population. Some of the earliest artifacts found in Central Asia derive from Siberia.

The Yeniseians were followed by the Uralic Samoyeds, who came from the northern Ural region. Some descendant cultures, such as the Selkup, remain in the Sayan region. Iron was unknown to them, but they excelled in bronze, silver, and gold work. Their bronze ornaments and implements, often polished, evince considerable artistic taste. They developed and managed irrigation to support their agriculture in wide areas of the fertile tracts.

Indo-Iranian influences in southwestern Siberia can be dated to the 2300–1000 BCE Andronovo culture. Between the 7th and 3rd centuries BCE, the Indo-Iranian Scythians flourished in the Altai region (Pazyryk culture). They were a major influence on all later steppe empires.

As early as the first millennium BCE, trade was underway over the Silk Road. Silk goods were imported and traded in Siberia.
The establishment of the Xiongnu empire in the 3rd century BCE started a series of population movements. Many people were probably driven to the northern borders of the great Central Siberian Plateau. Turkic people such as the Yenisei Kirghiz had already been present in the Sayan region. Various Turkic tribes such as the Khaka and Uyghur migrated northwestwards from their former seats and subdued the Ugric people.

These new invaders likewise left numerous traces of their stay, and two different periods may be easily distinguished from their remains. They were acquainted with iron, and learned from their subjects the art of bronze casting, which they used for decorative purposes only. They refined the artistry of this work. Their pottery is more artistic and of a higher quality than that of the Bronze Age. Their ornaments are included among the collections at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.

==Middle Ages==
===Mongol conquest of Southern and Western Siberia===

The Mongols had long maintained relations with the people of the Siberian forest (taiga). They called them &quot;oin irged&quot; (&quot;people of the forest&quot;). Many of them, such as the Barga and Uriankhai, were little different from the Mongols. While the tribes around Lake Baikal were Mongol-speaking, those to the west spoke Turkic, Samoyedic, or Yeniseian languages.

By 1206, Genghis Khan had united all Mongol and Turkic tribes on the Mongolian Plateau and southern Siberia. In 1207 his eldest son Jochi subjugated the Siberian forest people, the Uriankhai, the Oirats, Barga, Khakas, Buryats, Tuvans, , and Kyrgyz. He then organized the Siberians into three tumens. Genghis Khan gave the Telengit and Tolos along the Irtysh River to an old companion, Qorchi. While the Barga, Tumed, Buriats, Khori, Keshmiti, and Bashkirs were organized in separate thousands, the Telengit, Tolos, Oirats and Yenisei Kirghiz were numbered as tumens. Genghis created a settlement of ethnic Han craftsmen and farmers at Kem-kemchik after the first phase of the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty. The Great Khans favored gyrfalcons, furs, women and Kyrgyz horses for tribute.

Western Siberia came under the Golden Horde. The descendants of Orda Khan, the eldest son of Jochi, directly ruled the area. In the swamps of western Siberia, dog sled Yam stations were set up to facilitate collection of tribute.

In 1270, Kublai Khan sent an ethnic Han official, with a new batch of settlers, to serve as the judge of the Kyrgyz and Tuvan basin areas ( and ). Ögedei&#x27;s grandson Kaidu occupied portions of Central Siberia from 1275 on. The Yuan dynasty army under Kublai&#x27;s Kipchak general Tutugh reoccupied the Kyrgyz lands in 1293. From then on the Yuan dynasty controlled large portions of Central and Eastern Siberia.

The Yenisei area had a community of weavers of ethnic Han origin. Samarkand and Outer Mongolia both had artisans of Han origin.

===Novgorod and Muscovy===
As early as the 11th century the Novgorodians had occasionally penetrated into Siberia. In the 14th century the Novgorodians explored the Kara Sea and the West Siberian river Ob (1364). After the fall of the Novgorod Republic its communications between Northern Russia and Siberia were inherited by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. On May 9, 1483, the Moscow troops of Princes Feodor Kurbski-Cherny and Ivan Saltyk-Travin moved to West Siberia. The troops moved on the rivers Tavda, Tura, Irtysh, up to the River Ob. In 1499 Muscovites and Novgorodians skied to West Siberia, up to the river Ob, and conquered some local tribes.

==Khanate of Sibir==

With the breakup of the Golden Horde late in the 15th century, the Khanate of Sibir was founded with its center at Tyumen. The non-Borjigin Taybughid dynasty vied for rule with the descendants of Shiban, a son of Jochi.

In the beginning of the 16th century Tatar fugitives from Turkestan subdued the loosely associated tribes inhabiting the lowlands to the east of the Ural Mountains. Agriculturists, tanners, merchants, and mullahs (Muslim clerics) were brought from Turkestan, and small principalities sprang up on the Irtysh and the Ob. Conflicts with the Russians, who were then colonising the Urals, brought him into collision with Muscovy. Khan Yadegar&#x27;s envoys came to Moscow in 1555 and consented to a yearly tribute of a thousand sables.

===Yermak and the Cossacks===

In the mid-16th century, the Tsardom of Russia conquered the Tatar khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan, thus annexing the entire Volga Region and making the way to the Ural Mountains open. The colonisation of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants Stroganovs. Tsar Ivan IV granted large estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to Anikey Stroganov, who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with Siberian tribes.

In the 1570s, the entrepreneur Semyon Stroganov and other sons of Anikey Stroganov enlisted many cossacks for protection of the Ural settlements against attacks by the Tatars of the Siberian Khanate, led by Khan Kuchum. Stroganov suggested to their chief Yermak, hired in 1577, to conquer the Khanate of Sibir, promising to help him with supplies of food and arms.

In 1581, Yermak began his voyage into the depths of Siberia with a band of 1,636 men, following the Tagil and Tura Rivers. The following year they were on the Tobol, and 500 men successfully laid siege to Qashliq, the residence of Khan Kuchum, near what is now Tobolsk. After a few victories over the khan&#x27;s army, Yermak&#x27;s people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on Irtysh River after a 3-day battle of Chuvash Cape in 1582. The remains of the khan&#x27;s army retreated to the steppes, abandoning his domains to Yermak, who, according to tradition, by presenting Siberia to tsar Ivan IV achieved his own restoration to favour.

Kuchum was still strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River (Irtysh&#x27;s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own chain mail. Yermak&#x27;s Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but every year new bands of hunters and adventurers, supported by Moscow, poured into the country. Thanks to Yermak&#x27;s having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all of Yermak&#x27;s conquests just several years later.

==Russian exploration and settlement==

In the early 17th century, the eastward movement of Russian people was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the Time of Troubles. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. While Cossacks came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russian people came by the Arctic Ocean. These were Pomors from the Russian North, who had already been making fur trade with Mangazeya in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of Turukhansk was founded on the northern Yenisey River, near the mouth of the Lower Tunguska, and in 1619 Yeniseysky ostrog was founded on the mid-Yenisey at the mouth of the Upper Tunguska.

In 1620, a group of fur hunters led by the semi-legendary Demid Pyanda started out from Turukhansk on what would become a very protracted journey. According to folk tales related a century after the fact, in the three and a half years from 1620 to 1624 Pyanda allegedly traversed the total of of hitherto unknown large Siberian rivers. He explored some of the Lower Tunguska (Nizhnyaya Tunguska in Russian) and, having reached the upper part of the Tunguska, he came upon the great Siberian river Lena and explored some of its length. By doing this, he may have become the first Russian to reach Yakutia and meet Yakuts. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and by land reached Angara. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet Buryats. He built new boats and explored some of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a Buryat name) and Upper Tunguska (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by the Russian people) were one and the same river.
In 1627, Pyotr Beketov was appointed Yenisey voevoda in Siberia. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from Zabaykalye Buryats, becoming the first Russian to enter Buryatia. There he founded the first Russian settlement, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded Yakutsk and sent his Cossacks to explore the Aldan and further down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.

Yakutsk soon turned into a major base for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. Maksim Perfilyev, who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded Bratsky ostrog in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to enter Transbaikalia. In 1639 a group led by Ivan Moskvitin became the first Russian to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the Sea of Okhotsk, having built a winter camp on its shore at the Ulya River mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the proximity of the Amur River. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, maybe even reaching the mouth of the Amur River and discovering the Shantar Islands on their return voyage. Based on Moskvitin&#x27;s account, Kurbat Ivanov draw the first Russian map of the Far East in 1642. He led a group of Cossacks himself in 1643 to the south of the Baikal Mountains and discovered Lake Baikal, visiting its Olkhon Island. Subsequently, Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.
In 1643, Vasily Poyarkov crossed the Stanovoy Range and reached the upper Zeya River in the country of the Daurs, who were paying tribute to Manchu Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the Amur River. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the Sea of Okhotsk coast to the Ulya River and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by Ivan Moskvitin six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

In 1644, Mikhail Stadukhin discovered the Kolyma River and founded Srednekolymsk. A merchant named Fedot Alekseyev Popov organized a further expedition eastward, and Dezhnyov became a captain of one of the kochi. In 1648 they sailed from Srednekolymsk down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded Cape Dezhnyov, thus becoming the first explorers to pass through Bering Strait and to discover Chukotka and the Bering Sea. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the Anadyr River and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats out of the wreckage. They founded Anadyrsk and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land. Later Stadukhin set off to the south in 1651 and discovered Penzhin Bay on the northern side of the Okhotsk Sea. He also may have explored the western shores of Kamchatka as early as the 1650s.
In 1649–50, Yerofey Khabarov became the second Russian to explore the Amur River. Through the Olyokma, Tungur and Shilka Rivers he reached the Amur (Dauria), returned to Yakutsk and then went back to the Amur with a larger force in 1650–53. This time he was met with armed resistance. He built winter quarters at Albazin, then sailed down the Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day Khabarovsk, defeating or evading large armies of Daurian Manchu Chinese and Koreans on his way. He charted the Amur in his &quot;Draft of the Amur river&quot;.

In 1659–65, Kurbat Ivanov was the next head of Anadyrsky ostrog after Semyon Dezhnyov. In 1660, he sailed from Anadyr Bay to Cape Dezhnyov. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, he is credited with creation of the early map of Chukotka and Bering Strait, which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered Wrangel Island, both Diomede Islands and Alaska.

So, by the mid-17th century, the Russian people had established the borders of their country close to the modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except eastern Kamchatka and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka would be completed later, in the early 18th century by Vladimir Atlasov, while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be nearly completed by the Great Northern Expedition in 1733–1743. The expedition allowed cartographers to create a map of most of the northern coastline of Russia, thanks to the results brought by a series of voyages led by Fyodor Minin, Dmitry Ovtsyn, Vasili Pronchishchev, Semyon Chelyuskin, Dmitry Laptev and Khariton Laptev. At the same time, some of the members of the newly founded Russian Academy of Sciences traveled extensively through Siberia, forming the so-called Academic Squad of the Expedition. They were Johann Georg Gmelin, Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt and others, who became the first scientific explorers of Siberia.

===Russian people and Siberian natives===
The main treasure to attract Cossacks to Siberia was the fur of sables, foxes, and ermines. Explorers brought back many furs from their expeditions. Local people, submitting to the Russian Empire, received defense from the southern nomads. In exchange they were obliged to pay &quot;yasak&quot; (tribute) in the form of furs. There was a set of &quot;yasachnaya&quot; roads, used to transport yasak to Moscow.

A number of peoples showed open resistance to Russian people. Others submitted and even requested to be subordinated, though sometimes they later refused to pay yasak, or not admitted to the Russian authority.

There is evidence of collaboration and assimilation of Russian people with the local peoples in Siberia. Though the more Russian people advanced to the East, the less developed the local people were, and the more resistance they offered. In 1607–1610, the Tungus fought strenuously for their independence, but were subdued around 1623. The Buryats also offered some opposition, but were swiftly pacified. The most resistance was offered by the Koryak (on the Kamchatka Peninsula) and Chukchi (on the Chukchi Peninsula), the latter still being at the Stone Age level of development. Resistance by local people may have been the result of forced unfair terms, that recorders would have benefitted from omitting.

The Manchu resistance, however, obliged the Russian Cossacks to quit Albazin, and by the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) Russia abandoned her advance into the basin of the river, instead concentrating on the colonisation of the vast expanses of Siberia and trading with China via the Siberian trakt. In 1852, a Russian military expedition under Nikolay Muravyov explored the Amur, and by 1857 a chain of Russian Cossacks and peasants were settled along the whole course of the river. The accomplished fact was recognised by China in 1860 by the Treaty of Aigun.
===Scientists in Siberia===
The scientific exploration of Siberia, commenced in the period of 1720 to 1742 by Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt, Johann Georg Gmelin, and Louis de l&#x27;Isle de la Croyère, was followed up by Gerhard Friedrich Müller, Johann Eberhard Fischer, and Johann Gottlieb Georgi. Peter Simon Pallas, with several Russian students, laid the first foundation of a thorough exploration of the topography, fauna, flora, and inhabitants of the country. The journeys of Christopher Hansteen and Georg Adolf Erman were the most important step in the exploration of the territory. Alexander von Humboldt, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, and Gustav Rose also paid short visits to Siberia, which gave a new impulse to the accumulation of scientific knowledge; while Carl Ritter elaborated in his &quot;Asien&quot; (1832–1859) the foundations of a sound knowledge of the structure of Siberia. Aleksandr Fyodorovich Middendorf&#x27;s journey (1843–1845) to north-eastern Siberia — contemporaneous with Matthias Castrén&#x27;s journeys for the special study of the Ural-Altaic languages — directed attention to the far north and awakened interest in the Amur, the basin of which soon became the scene of the expeditions of Akhte and Schwarz (1852), and later on of the Siberian expedition, advanced knowledge of East Siberia.

The Siberian branch of the Russian Geographical Society was founded at the same time in Irkutsk, and afterwards became a permanent centre for the exploration of Siberia; while the opening of the Amur and Sakhalin attracted Richard Maack, Schmidt, Glehn, Gustav Radde, and Leopold von Schrenck, who created works on the flora, fauna, and inhabitants of Siberia.

===Russian settlement===

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Russian people who migrated into Siberia were hunters, and those who had escaped from Central Russia: fugitive peasants in search for life free of serfdom, fugitive convicts, and Old Believers. The new settlements of Russian people and the existing local peoples required defence from nomads, for which forts were founded. This way forts of Tomsk and Berdsk were founded.

In the beginning of the 18th century, the threat of the nomads&#x27; attacks weakened; thus the region became more and more populated; normal civic life was established in the cities.

In the 18th century in Siberia, a new administrative &quot;guberniya&quot; was formed with Irkutsk, then in the 19th century the territory was several times re-divided with creation of new guberniyas: Tomsk (with center in Tomsk) and Yenisei (Yeniseysk, later Krasnoyarsk).

In 1730, the first large industrial project — the metallurgical production found by Demidov family — gave birth to the city of Barnaul. Later, the enterprise organized social institutions like library, club, theatre. Pyotr Semenov-Tyan-Shansky, who stayed in Barnaul in 1856–1857, wrote: &quot;The richness of mining engineers of Barnaul expressed not merely in their households and clothes, but more in their educational level, knowledge of science and literature. Barnaul was undoubtedly the most cultured place in Siberia, and I&#x27;ve called it Siberian Athenes, leaving Sparta for Omsk&quot;.

The same events took place in other cities; public libraries, museums of local lore, colleges, theatres were being built, although the first university in Siberia was opened as late as 1880 in Tomsk.

Siberian peasants more than those in European Russia relied on their own force and abilities. They had to fight against the harder climate without outside help. Absence of serfdom and landlords also contributed to their independent character. Unlike peasants in European Russia, Siberians had no problems with land availability; the low population density gave them the ability to intensively cultivate a plot for several years in a row, then to leave it fallow for a long time and cultivate other plots. Siberian peasants had an abundance of food, while Central Russian peasantry had to moderate their families&#x27; appetites. Leonid Blummer noted that the culture of alcohol consumption differed significantly; Siberian peasants drank frequently but moderately: &quot;For a Siberian vodka isn&#x27;t a wonder, unlike for a Russian peasant, which, having reached it after all this time, is ready to drink a sea.&quot; The houses, according to travellers&#x27; notes, were unlike the typical Russian izbas: the houses were big, often two-floored, the ceilings were high, the walls were covered with boards and painted with oil-paint.

==Russian Empire==
===Administrative divisions===
The Siberia Governorate was established in 1708 as part of the administrative reforms of Peter I.
In 1719, the governorate was divided into three provinces, Vyatka, Solikamsk and Tobolsk.
In 1762, it was renamed to Tsardom of Siberia (Сибирское царство).
In 1782, under the impression of Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion, the Siberian kingdom was divided into three separate viceregencies (наместничество), centered at Tobolsk, Irkutsk and Kolyvan. These viceregencies were downgraded to the status of governorate in 1796 (Tobolsk Governorate, Irkutsk Governorate, Vyatka Governorate).
Tomsk Governorate was split off Tobolsk governorate in 1804. Yakutsk Oblast was split off Irkutsk Governorate in 1805.
In 1822, the subdivision of Siberia was reformed again. It was divided into two governorates general, West Siberia and East Siberia.
West Siberia comprised the Tobolsk and Tomsk governorates, and East Siberia comprised Irkutsk Governorate, and the newly formed Yeniseysk Governorate.

===Decembrists and other exiles===
Siberia was deemed a good place to exile for political reasons, as it was far from any foreign country. A St. Petersburg citizen would not wish to escape in the vast Siberian countryside as the peasants and criminals did. Even the larger cities such as Irkutsk, Omsk, and Krasnoyarsk, lacked that intensive social life and luxurious high life of the capital.

About eighty people involved in the Decembrist revolt were sentenced to obligatory work in Siberia and perpetual settlement here. Eleven wives followed them and settled near the labour camps. In their memoirs, they noted benevolence and prosperity of rural Siberians and severe treatment by the soldiers and officers.

:&quot;Travelling through Siberia, I was wondered and fascinated at every step by the cordiality and hospitality I met everywhere. I was fascinated by the richness and the abundance, with which the people live until today (1861), but that time there was even more expanse in everything. The hospitality was especially developed in Siberia. Everywhere we were received like being in friendly countries, everywhere we were fed well, and when I asked how much I owed them, they didn&#x27;t want to take anything, saying &quot;Put a candle to the God&quot;.&quot;

:&quot;...Siberia is an extremely rich country, the land is unusually fruitful, and little work is needed to get a plentiful harvest.&quot;

Polina Annenkova, Notes of a Decembrist&#x27;s Wife

A number of Decembrists died of diseases, some suffered psychological shock and even went out of their mind.

After completing the term of obligatory work, they were sentenced to settle in specific small towns and villages. There, some started doing business, which was well permitted. Only several years later, in the 1840s, they were allowed to move to big cities or to settle anywhere in Siberia. Only in 1856, 31 years after the revolt, Alexander II pardoned and restituted the Decembrists in honour of his coronation.

Living in the cities of Omsk, Krasnoyarsk, and Irkutsk, the Decembrists contributed extensively to the social life and culture. In Irkutsk, their houses are now museums. In many places, memorial plaques with their names have been installed.

Yet, there were exceptions: Vladimir Rayevsky was arrested for participation in Decembrists&#x27; circles in 1822, and in 1828 was exiled to Olonki village near Irkutsk. There he married and had nine children, traded with bread, and founded a school for children and adults to teach arithmetics and grammar. Being pardoned by Alexander II, he visited his native town, but returned to Olonki.

Despite the wishes of the central authorities, the exiled revolutioners unlikely felt outcast in Siberia. Quite the contrary, Siberians having lived all the time on their own, &quot;didn&#x27;t feel tenderness&quot; to the authorities. In many cases, the exiled were cordially received and got paid positions.

Fyodor Dostoevsky was exiled to katorga near Omsk and to military service in Semipalatinsk. In the service he also had to make trips for Barnaul and Kuznetsk, where he married.

Anton Chekhov was not exiled, but in 1890 made a trip on his own to Sakhalin through Siberia and visited a katorga there. In his trip, he visited Tomsk, speaking disapprovingly about it, then Krasnoyarsk, which he called &quot;the most beautiful Siberian city&quot;. He noted that despite being more a place of criminal rather than political exile, the moral atmosphere was much better: he did not face any case of theft. Blummer suggested to prepare a gun, but his attendant replied: &quot;What for?! We are not in Italy, you know.&quot; Chekhov observed that besides of the evident prosperity, there was an urgent demand for cultural development.

Many Poles were also exiled to Siberia (see &quot;Sybirak&quot;). In 1866 they incited the Baikal Insurrection.

===Trans-Siberian Railway===

The development of Siberia was hampered by poor transportation links within the region as well as between Siberia and the rest of the country. Aside from the Sibirsky trakt, good roads suitable for wheeled transport were few and far apart. For about five months of the year, rivers were the main means of transportation; during the cold half of the year, cargo and passengers travelled by horse-drawn sleds over the winter roads, many of which were the same rivers, now ice-covered.

The first steamboat on the Ob, Nikita Myasnikov&#x27;s &quot;Osnova&quot;, was launched in 1844; but the early starts were difficult, and it was not until 1857 that steamboat shipping started developing in the Ob system in the serious way. Steamboats started operating on the Yenisei in 1863, on the Lena and Amur in the 1870s.

While the comparably flat Western Siberia was at least fairly well served by the gigantic Ob–Irtysh–Tobol–Chulym river system, the mighty rivers of Eastern Siberia – Yenisei, Upper Angara (Angara below Bratsk was not easily navigable because of the rapids), Lena — were mostly navigable only in the north–south direction. An attempt to somewhat remedy the situation by building the Ob–Yenisei Canal were not particularly successful. Only a railroad could be a real solution to the region&#x27;s transportation problems.
The first projects of railroads in Siberia emerged since the creation of the Moscow–St. Petersburg railroad. One of the first was Irkutsk–Chita project, intended to connect the former to the Amur river and, consequently, to the Pacific Ocean.

Prior to 1880 the central government seldom responded to such projects, due to weakness of Siberian enterprises, fear of Siberian territories&#x27; integration with the Pacific region rather than with Russia, and thus falling under the influence of the United States and Great Britain. The heavy and clumsy bureaucracy and the fear of financial risks also contributed to the inaction: the financial system always underestimated the effects of the railway, assuming that it would take only the existing traffic.

Mainly the fear of losing Siberia convinced Alexander II in 1880 to make a decision to build the railway. Construction started in 1891.

Trans-Siberian Railroad gave a great boost to Siberian agriculture, allowing for increased exports to Central Russia and European countries. It pushed not only the territories closest to the railway, but also those connected with meridional rivers, such as the Ob (Altai) and the Yenisei (Minusinsk and Abakan regions).
Siberian agriculture exported a lot of cheap grain to the West. The agriculture in Central Russia was still under pressure of serfdom, formally abandoned in 1861. Another profitable industry is the fur trade, which contributed greatly to the national revenue on top of covering administrative costs in Siberia.

Thus, to defend it and to prevent possible social destabilization, in 1896 (when the eastern and western parts of the Trans-Siberian did not close up yet), the government introduced Chelyabinsk tariff break ()—a tariff barrier for grain in Chelyabinsk, and a similar barrier in Manchuria. This measure changed the form of cereal product export: mills emerged in Altai, Novosibirsk, and Tomsk; many farms switched to butter production. From 1896 to 1913 Siberia on average exported 30.6 million poods (~500,000 tonnes) of cereal products (grain, flour) annually.

===Stolypin&#x27;s resettlement programme===
One early significant settlement campaign was carried out under Nicholas II by Prime Minister Stolypin in 1906–1911.

The rural areas of Central Russia were overcrowded, while the East was still lightly populated despite having fertile lands. On May 10, 1906, by the decree of the Tsar, agriculturalists were granted the right to transfer, without any restrictions, to the Asian territories of Russia, and to obtain cheap or free land. A large advertising campaign was conducted: six million copies of brochures and banners entitled &quot;What the resettlement gives to peasants&quot;, and &quot;How the peasants in Siberia live&quot; were printed and distributed in rural areas. Special propaganda trains were sent throughout the countryside, and transport trains were provided for the migrants. The State gave loans to the settlers for farm construction.

Not all the settlers decided to stay; 17.8% migrated back. All in all, more than three million people officially resettled to Siberia, and 750,000 came as foot-messengers. From 1897 to 1914 Siberian population increased 73%, and the area of land under cultivation doubled.
===Tunguska event===

The Tunguska Event, or Tunguska explosion, was a powerful explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya (Lower Stony) Tunguska River in what is now Krasnoyarsk Krai of Russia, at around 7:14 a.m. (0:14 UT, 7:02 a.m. local solar time) on June 30, 1908 (June 17 in the Julian calendar, in use locally at the time).

The cause of the explosion is controversial, and still much disputed to this day. Although the cause of the explosion is the subject of debate, it is commonly believed to have been caused by a meteor air burst: the atmospheric explosion of a large meteoroid or comet fragment at an altitude of above the Earth&#x27;s surface. Different studies have yielded varying estimates of the object&#x27;s size, with general agreement that it was a few tens of metres across.

Although the Tunguska event is believed to be the largest impact event on land in Earth&#x27;s recent history, impacts of similar size in remote ocean areas would have gone unnoticed before the advent of global satellite monitoring in the 1960s and 1970s. Because the event occurred in a remote area, there was little damage to human life or property, and it was in fact some years until it was properly investigated.

The first recorded expedition arrived at the scene more than a decade after the event. In 1921, the Russian mineralogist Leonid Kulik, visiting the Podkamennaya Tunguska River basin as part of a survey for the Soviet Academy of Sciences, deduced from local accounts that the explosion had been caused by a giant meteorite impact. He persuaded the Soviet government to fund an expedition to the Tunguska region, based on the prospect of meteoric iron that could be salvaged to aid Soviet industry.

Kulik&#x27;s party reached the site in 1927. To their surprise, no crater was to be found. There was instead a region of scorched trees about across. A few near ground zero were still strangely standing upright, their branches and bark stripped off. Those farther away had been knocked down in a direction away from the center.

==Russian Civil War==
By the time of the revolution Siberia was an agricultural region of Russia, with weak entrepreneur and industrial classes. The intelligentsia had vague political ideas. Only 13% of the region&#x27;s population lived in the cities and possessed some political knowledge. The lack of strong social differences and scarcity of urban population and intellectuals led to the uniting of formally different political parties under ideas of regionalism.

The anti-Bolshevik forces failed to offer a united resistance. While Kolchak fought against the Bolsheviks intending to eliminate them in the capital of the Empire, the local Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks tried to sign a peace treaty with the Bolsheviks, on terms of independence. Foreign allies, though being able to make a decisive effort, preferred to stay neutral, although Kolchak himself rejected the offer of help from Japan.

After a series of defeats in Central Russia, Kolchak&#x27;s forces retreated to Siberia. Amid resistance of Socialist-Revolutionaries and waning support from the allies, the Whites had to evacuate from Omsk to Irkutsk, and finally Kolchak resigned under pressure of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who soon submitted to the Bolsheviks.

==Soviet era==
===1920s and 1930s===
By the 1920s the agriculture in Siberia was in decline. With the large number of immigrants, land was used very intensively, which led to exhaustion of the land and frequent bad harvests.
Agriculture wasn&#x27;t destroyed by the civil war, but the disorganization of the exports destroyed the food industry and reduced the peasants&#x27; incomes. Furthermore, prodrazvyorstka and then the natural food tax contributed to growing discontent. In 1920–1924 there was a number of anti-communistic riots in rural areas, with up to 40,000 people involved. Both old Whites (Cossacks) and old &quot;Reds&quot; partisans, who earlier fought against Kolchak, the marginals, who were the major force of the Communists, took part in the riots. According to a survey of 1927 in Irkutsk Oblast, the peasants openly said they would participate in anti-Soviet rebellion and hoped for foreign help. In 1929, one such anti-Soviet rebellion took place in Buryatia, the rebellion was put down will the deaths of 35,000 Buryats. It should also be noticed that the KVZhD builders and workers were declared enemies of the people by a special order of the Soviet authorities.

The youth, that had socialized in the age of war, was highly militarized, and the Soviet government pushed the further military propaganda by Komsomol. There are many documented evidences of &quot;red banditism&quot;, especially in the countryside, such as desecration of churches and Christian graves, and even murders of priests and believers. Also in many cases a Komsomol activist or an authority representative, speaking with a person opposed to the Soviets, got angry and killed him/her and anybody else. The Party faintly counteracted this.

In the 1930s, the Party started the collectivization, which automatically put the &quot;kulak&quot; label on the well-off families living in Siberia for a long time. Naturally, &quot;raskulachivanie&quot; applied to everyone who protested. From the Central Russia many families were exiled to low-populated, forest or swampy areas of Siberia, but those who lived here, had either to escape anywhere, or to be exiled in the Northern regions (such as Evenk and Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrugs and the northern parts of Tomsk Oblast). Collectivization destroyed the traditional and most effective stratum of the peasants in Siberia and the natural ways of development, and its consequences are still persisting.

In the cities, during the New Economic Policy and later, the new authorities, driven by the romantic socialistic ideas made attempts to build new socialistic cities, according to the fashionable constructivism movement, but after all have left only numbers of square houses. For example, the Novosibirsk theatre was initially designed in pure constructivistic style. It was an ambitious project of exiled architects. In the mid-1930s with introduction of new classicism, it was significantly redesigned.

After the Trans-Siberian was built, Omsk soon became the largest Siberian city, but in 1930s Soviets favoured Novosibirsk. In the 1930s the first heavy industrialization took place in the Kuznetsk Basin (coal mining and ferrous metallurgy) and at Norilsk (nickel and rare-earth metals). The Northern Sea Route saw industrial application. At the same time, with growing number of prisoners, Gulag established a large network of labour camps in Siberia.

===World War II===
In 1941, many enterprises and people were evacuated into Siberian cities by the railroads. In urgent need of ammunition and military equipment, they started working almost immediately after their materials and equipment were unloaded.

Most of the evacuated enterprises remained at their new sites after the war. They increased industrial production in Siberia to a great extent, and became constitutive for many cities, like Rubtsovsk. The easternmost city to receive them was Ulan-Ude, since Chita was considered dangerously close to China and Japan.

On August 28, 1941, the Supreme Soviet stated an order &quot;About the Resettlement of the Germans of Volga region&quot;, by which many of them were deported into different rural areas of Kazakhstan and Siberia.

By the end of war, thousands of captive soldiers and officers of German and Japanese armies were sentenced to several years of work in labour camps in all the regions of Siberia. These camps were directed by a different administration than Gulag. Although Soviet camps hadn&#x27;t the purpose to lead prisoners to death, the death rate was significant, especially in winters. The range of works differed from vegetable farming to construction of the Baikal Amur Mainline.

===Industrial expansion===
In the second half of the 20th century, the exploration of mineral and hydroenergetic resources continued. Many of these projects were planned, but were delayed due to wars and the ever-changing opinions of Soviet politicians.

The most famous project is the Baikal Amur Mainline. It was planned simultaneously with Trans-Siberian, but the construction began just before World War II, was put on hold during the war and restarted after. After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death, it was again suspended for years to be continued under Leonid Brezhnev.

A cascade of hydroelectric powerplants was built in the 1960s–1970s on the Angara River, a project similar to Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States. The powerplants allowed creation and support of large production facilities, such as the aluminium plant in Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk, rare-earth mining in Angara basin, and those associated with the timber industry. The price of electricity in Angara basin is the lowest in Russia. But the Angara cascade is not fully finished yet: the Boguchany power plant waits to be finished, and a series of enterprises are planned to be set up.

The downside of this development is ecological damage due to low standards of production and excessive sizes of dams (the bigger projects were favoured by industrial authorities and received more funding), the increased humidity sharpened the already hard climate. Another powerplant project on Katun River in Altai mountains in the 1980s, which was widely protested publicly, was cancelled.

There are a number of military-oriented centers like the NPO Vektor and closed cities like Seversk. By the end of the 1980s a large portion of the industrial production of Omsk and Novosibirsk (up to 40%) was composed of military and aviation output. The collapse of state-funded military orders began an economic crisis.
The Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences unites a lot of research institutes in the biggest cities, the biggest being the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Akademgorodok (a scientific town) near Novosibirsk. Other scientific towns or just districts composed by research institutes, also named &quot;Akademgorodok&quot;, are in the cities of Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk. These sites are the centers of the newly developed IT industry, especially in that of Novosibirsk, nicknamed &quot;Silicon Taiga&quot;, and in Tomsk.

A number of Siberian-based companies extended their businesses of various consumer products to meta-regional and an All-Russian level. Various Siberian artists and industries, have created communities that are not centralized in Moscow anymore, like the Idea (annual low-budged ads festival), Golden Capital (annual prize in architecture).

==Recent history==
Until completion of the Chita–Khabarovsk highway, the Transbaikalia was a dead end for automobile transport. While this recently constructed through road will at first benefit mostly the transit travel to and from the Pacific provinces, it will also boost settlement and industrial expansion in the sparsely populated regions of Zabaykalsky Krai and Amur Oblast.

Expansion of transportation networks will continue to define the directions of Siberian regional development. The next project to be carried out is the completion of the railroad branch to Yakutsk. Another large project, proposed already in the 19th century as a northern option for the Transsiberian railroad, is the Northern-Siberian Railroad between Nizhnevartovsk,
Belyi Yar, Lesosibirsk and Ust-Ilimsk. The Russian Railroads instead suggest an ambitious project of a railway to Magadan, Chukchi Peninsula and then the supposed Bering Strait Tunnel to Alaska.

While the Russians continue to migrate from the Siberian and
Far Eastern Federal Districts to Western Russia, the Siberian cities attract labour (legal or illegal) from the Central Asian republics and from China. While the natives are aware of the situation, in Western Russia myths about thousands and millions of Chinese living in the Transbaikalia and the Far East are widespread.

<doc id="240546" wikidata="Q320959" url="?curid=240546" title="Robert Blake (admiral)">
<text>Robert Blake (27 September 1598 – 7 August 1657) was an English naval officer who served as general at sea and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1656 to 1657. Blake served under Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War and Anglo-Spanish War, and as the commanding Admiral of the State&#x27;s Navy during the First Anglo-Dutch War. Blake is recognized as the &quot;chief founder of England&#x27;s naval supremacy&quot;, a dominance subsequently inherited by the British Royal Navy well into the early 20th century. Despite this, due to deliberate attempts to expunge the Parliamentarians from historical records following the Stuart Restoration, Blake&#x27;s achievements tend to remain relatively unrecognized. Blake&#x27;s successes, however, are considered to have &quot;never been excelled, not even by Nelson&quot; according to one biographer, while Blake is often compared with Nelson by others.

==Early life==
Robert Blake was the first son of thirteen children born to Humphrey Blake and Sarah Williams. He was baptized at the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin in Somerset on 27 September 1598. He attended Bridgwater Grammar School for Boys, then went to Wadham College, Oxford. He had hoped to follow an academic career, but failed to secure a fellowship to Merton College, probably in consideration of his political and religious views, but also because the warden of Merton, Sir Henry Savile, had &#x27;an eccentric distaste for men of low stature&#x27;. Blake, at tall, thus failed to meet Savile&#x27;s &#x27;standard of manly beauty&#x27;.

When Blake&#x27;s father died in 1625 he inherited the family estate of Knoll Hill. Here, taking on the responsibilities of the eldest son, he took committed much of his time in the duty of educating his many brothers and sisters, and preparing them for adulthood. Blake biographer and historian David Hannay (1853–1934) maintains that was a likely reason why Blake never married, while pointing out also that other biographers offer differing reasons. English historian Edward Hyde, who lived in Blake&#x27;s day writes of Blake, &quot;...he was well enough versed in books for a man who intended not to be of any profession, having sufficient of his own to maintain him in the plenty he affected, and having then no appearance of ambition to be a greater man than he was.&quot;

The Blake family had a seat for several generations at (and were Lords of the Manor of) Tuxwell, in the parish of Bishops Lydeard, near Bridgwater, Somerset. The earliest member of the family located in records was Humphrey Blake, who lived in the reign of Henry VIII. Robert Blake&#x27;s grandfather, also named Robert, was the first of the family to strike out on his own from country life as a merchant, hoping to become rich from Spanish trade. He served as chief magistrate and member of Parliament for Bridgwater several times, in recognition of the esteem in which the townspeople held him. His son, Humphrey, succeeded him in business, and in addition to his father&#x27;s estates at Puriton (of which he held the lordship), Catcot, Bawdrip and Woolavington, came into the estate at Plainsfield held by the family of his wife, Sarah Williams, since the reign of Henry VII.

After his departure from university in 1625, it is believed that Blake was engaged in trade, and a Dutch writer subsequently claimed that he had lived for &#x27;five or six years&#x27; in Schiedam. Having returned to Bridgwater, probably because of the death of his mother in 1638, he decided to stand for election to Parliament.

==Political background==
In April, 1640, Blake was elected as the Member of Parliament for Bridgwater in the Short Parliament, as one of two Burgesses for Bridgwater. When the English Civil War broke out during the period of the Long Parliament, and having failed to be re-elected in November, Blake began his military career on the side of the parliamentarians despite having no substantial experience of military or naval matters.

Blake returned to Parliament as member for Taunton in 1645, when the Royalist Colonel Windham was expelled. He would later return to recover from an injury sustained in the Battle of Portland. During that time he represented Bridgwater in the Barebone&#x27;s Parliament of 1653 and First Protectorate Parliament of 1654 and Taunton in the Second Protectorate Parliament of 1656 before returning to sea.

==Naval service==
Blake is often referred to as the &#x27;Father of the Royal Navy&#x27;. As well as being largely responsible for building the largest navy the country had ever known, from a few tens of ships to well over a hundred, he was also the first to keep a fleet at sea over the winter. Blake also produced the navy&#x27;s first ever set of rules and regulations, &quot;The Laws of War and Ordinances of the Sea&quot;, the first version of which, containing 20 provisions, was passed by the House of Commons on 5 March 1649, listing 39 offences and their punishments—mostly death. The &quot;Instructions of the Admirals and Generals of the Fleet for Councils of War&quot;, issued in 1653 by Blake, George Monck, John Disbrowe and William Penn, also instituted the first naval courts-martial in the English navy.

Blake developed new techniques to conduct blockades and landings; his &quot;Sailing Instructions&quot; and &quot;Fighting Instructions&quot;, which were major overhauls of naval tactics written while recovering from injury in 1653, were the foundation of English naval tactics in the Age of Sail. Blake&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Instructions&quot;, issued by the generals at sea on 29 March 1653, are the first-known instructions to be written in any language to adopt the use of the single line ahead battle formation. Blake was also the first to successfully attack despite fire from shore forts.

===English Civil War===

Before Blake embarked on a naval career he joined the New Model Army as a captain in Alexander Popham&#x27;s regiment, Blake distinguished himself at the Siege of Bristol (July 1643) and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. After his leading role in holding Lyme Regis in the Siege of Lyme Regis (April 1644) he was promoted to colonel. He went on to hold the Parliamentary enclave of Taunton during the Siege of Taunton in 1645. Taunton was of great strategic importance as it was situated where all the main roads converged, commanding all lines of communication, which at the time Blake alone understood. After he took it by surprise, the siege earned him national recognition; it was where he famously declared that he would eat three of his four pairs of boots before he would surrender. He subsequently succeeded in winning the Siege of Dunster (November 1645).

In March 1649 the newly established Commonwealth government appointed Popham, Blake and Deane as Generals at Sea, in that respective order of command, even though Blake had little experience at sea up until that time. With Deane committed in Scotland, Blake&#x27;s first naval commission was in 1649, as second in command of the Dutch Navy against a domestic enemy with the objective of crushing the weary remnants of the Royalist party. King Charles I&#x27;s followers were completely conquered and expelled from the mainland in England, but they still continued to fight on the sea and were taking many prizes, causing outcries from many of the merchants. Parliament was thus compelled to establish a naval administration, which appointed Blake, Popham and Deane as commanders of a fleet they were putting together and outfitting. Some three weeks before the execution of Charles I, on 11 January 1649, Prince Rupert of the Rhine led eight undermanned ships to Kinsale where the King&#x27;s flag was still flying, in Ireland, in an attempt to prevent the Parliamentarians taking Ireland from the Royalists. Blake blockaded Rupert&#x27;s fleet in Kinsale from 22 May, allowing Oliver Cromwell, who placed great confidence in Blake, to land at Dublin on 15 August. Blake was driven off by a storm in October and Rupert escaped via Spain to Lisbon. When it was learned that Rupert had fled to Lisbon, all cautionary protocols were suspended for the navy. Blake was recalled to Plymouth to supervise the fitting out of a fleet that was expanded to thirteen ships. With his refurbished and well supplied fleet, Blake put to sea in February 1650 and dropped anchor off Lisbon in an attempt to persuade the Portuguese king to expel Rupert. After two months the king decided to back Rupert. Blake was joined by another eight warships commanded by Edward Popham, who brought authority to go to war with Portugal. Blake now bore the risk and responsibility of a prolonged blockade, where now neither food nor water were accessible from the shore, making it necessary to periodically dispatch ships to Vigo or Cádiz for supplies, to which Richard Bidley, 1899 was given the charge.

Rupert twice failed to break the blockade, which was finally raised after Blake sailed for Cádiz with seven ships he had captured after a three-hour engagement with 23 ships of the Portuguese fleet (during which the Portuguese vice-admiral was also sunk.) Blake re-engaged with Rupert, now with six ships, on 3 November near Málaga, capturing one ship. Two days later Rupert&#x27;s other ships in the area were driven ashore attempting to escape from Cartagena, securing Parliamentarian supremacy at sea, and the recognition of the Parliamentary government by many European states. Parliament voted Blake 1,000 pounds by way of thanks in February 1651. In June of the same year Blake captured the Isles of Scilly, the last outpost of the Royalist navy, for which he again received Parliament&#x27;s thanks. Soon afterwards he was made a member of the Council of State.

In 1651 Blake received orders to remove the Royalist Sir John Granville from the Isles of Scilly, where he had been appointed Governor by Charles II after a local rebellion. Granville had around 1,000 men under his command. The majority of Royalists forces were holding the main island of St Mary&#x27;s, also defended by the guns of Star Castle and several frigates anchored, including the most powerful of the Royalist warships, making a direct assault very dangerous. Blake subsequently decided to secure Tresco and Bryher first, which would give the Commonwealth force a safe anchorage at New Grimsby harbour. After a failed attempt due to unfavourable winds, and other delays Blake finally prevailed and demanded Granville&#x27;s surrender and ultimately secured the isles, also capturing many commanders and supplies

===First Anglo-Dutch War===

Blake&#x27;s next adventures were during the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–1654). The war started prematurely with a skirmish between the Dutch fleet of Maarten Tromp and Blake on 29 May 1652, at the Battle of Dover.

On 19 May 1652, Tromp was patrolling in the English Channel with a fleet of forty ships between Nieuport and the mouth of the Meuse River, to provide protection Dutch merchant ships, while monitoring the activity of the English fleet who had been seizing Dutch merchant ships. Blake was lying in Dover Roads with fifteen ships, with eight others in reserve of the coast of Lincolnshire in The Downs. When Tromp failed to lower his flag in salute, Blake, aboard his flagship the &quot;James&quot;, believing Tromp had just received orders from a Dutch dispatch ketch to commence battle, fired two warning shots, without ball. Subsequently the Battle of Dover began when Tromp refused to strike his flag, but instead hoisted a red battle flag in defiance. This caused Blake to fire a third gun, damaging Tromp&#x27;s ship and wounding some crew members. Tromp in return fired a warning broadside from his flagship &quot;Brederode&quot;. Blake in turn fired a broadside and a five-hour battle ensued. The fighting continued until nightfall, where both sides withdrew, the battle having no distinct victor.

The proper war started in June with an English campaign against the Dutch East Indies, Baltic and fishing trades by Blake, in command of around 60 ships. On 5 October 1652 Dutch Vice-Admiral Witte Corneliszoon de With, underestimating the strength of the English, attempted to attack Blake, but due to the weather it was Blake who attacked on 8 October 1652 in the Battle of the Kentish Knock, sending de With back to the Netherlands in defeat. The English government seemed to think that the war was over and sent ships away to the Mediterranean. Blake had only 42 warships when he was attacked and decisively defeated by 88 Dutch ships under Tromp on 9 December 1652 in the Battle of Dungeness, losing control of the English Channel to the Dutch. Meanwhile, the ships sent away had also been defeated in the Battle of Leghorn. Following the navy&#x27;s poor performance at Dungeness, Blake demanded that the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty enact major reforms. They complied by, among other things, enacting Articles of War to reinforce the authority of an admiral over his captains.

After the Battle of Dungeness in November 1652 the Dutch navy was in control of the English Channel through the winter of 1652–1653, allowing trade and commerce to once again resume. During this time, however, the English fleet had been refitted and reorganized, and by the beginning of February the English fleet numbered about eighty ships, which were promptly put into operation on 11 February under the joint command of the generals-at-sea Blake, Monck and Deane, setting the stage for the Battle of Portland. Blake&#x27;s main objective was to intercept Lieutenant-Admiral Tromp, who was expected to escort a large merchant fleet from the Mediterranean to the Netherlands.
The English fleet was divided into three squadrons, the Red, Blue and White, each with its own vice- and rear-admirals which for the first time in British naval history established an ordered command hierarchy for the British Navy. Blake, aboard his flagship the &quot;Triumph&quot;, was in command of the red squadron, with Monck in command of the Blue and Penn in command of the white. 
Blake was informed that Tromp&#x27;s fleet was approaching and was no more than forty leagues to the west.
Tromp had the great responsibility of getting his merchant convey home to safety, but when he learned that Blake was waiting for him in the channel, and that his fleet of warships was about the same size as Blake&#x27;s fleet, and with the weather gage in his favor, he decided to take the initiative and move on Blake&#x27;s fleet, leaving his convoy of merchant ships about four miles up wind. 

While Blake&#x27;s fleet had recently been outfitted with fresh supplies and ammunition, Tromp has been out to sea since November and was in short supply of ammunition.
Knowing that Tromp&#x27;s fleet and convoy of merchant ships had to pass his way to reach their destination, Blake was not compelled to go out searching for them. On 18 February the Dutch fleet of seventy-five ships came into Blake&#x27;s view, but his squadrons had not yet grouped into their formations, having arrived there in haste at short notice. His red squadron was in position, but the White squadron was several miles to the east, while the Blue squadron was at some distance to the west, leaving Blake with about a dozen ships to face the entire Dutch fleet, which had the wind in their favor.
Tromp seized the advantageous opportunity and moved on Blake&#x27;s lone squadron, and at eight in the morning a furious battle commenced. Subsequently Blake&#x27;s squadron endured heavy damage and casualties, with 100 lives lost on the &quot;Triumph&quot;, but the squadron was able to keep the Dutch fleet at bay. While the battle raged furiously, Blake was severely wounded in his thigh, while his flag-captain Andrew Ball was killed. Several hours would pass before Blake&#x27;s other squadrons arrived at the scene. As Tromp&#x27;s ships began to use up their supply of powder, they retreated from the engagement and headed for home, while the withdrawal of the remaining ships turned into a desperate flight for survival.

Thanks to its command of the sea, the fleet was able to supply Cromwell&#x27;s army with provisions as it successfully marched on Scotland. By the end of 1652 the various English colonies in the Americas had also been secured.

At the Battle of the Gabbard on 12 and 13 June 1653 Blake reinforced the ships of Generals Richard Deane and George Monck and decisively defeated the Dutch fleet, sinking or capturing 17 ships without losing one. Now also the North Sea was brought under English control, and the Dutch fleet was blockaded in various ports until the Battle of Scheveningen, where Tromp was killed.

Peace with the Dutch achieved, Blake sailed in October 1654 with 24 warships as commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, successfully deterring the Duke of Guise from conquering Naples. In 1656, the year before his death, Blake was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

===Bay of Tunis===

In April 1655 Blake was selected by Cromwell to sail into the Mediterranean again to extract compensation from the Duke of Tuscany, the Knights of Malta, and the piratical states of North Africa, that had been attacking English shipping. The Dey of Tunis was the only one who refused compensation, while also refusing to return captured British sailors held as slaves. and further negotiations became futile. Blake, aboard his flagship &quot;George&quot;, at first, needing to replenish water and other supplies, withdrew his fleet to Trapani, leading the Dey to assume his fleet had retreated, and on 3 April 1655 he returned to Porto Farina. The following morning Blake, with fifteen ships, prepared for an attack on the castle and ships in the harbour which were protected by twenty cannon in the castle, along with other defensive works along the shore. During the assault Blake destroyed the two shore batteries and nine Algerian ships with continual cannon fire from Blake&#x27;s ships, while the wind off the sea blew the intense smoke from the guns at the castle and into the town, obscuring the enemy&#x27;s view. His crews boarded the ships docked in the harbour one at a time and set them ablaze, and within hours they were all reduced to scorched timber and ashes. With only twenty-five killed and forty wounded, it was the first time shore batteries had been neutralized without landing men ashore. Hoping that he had not exceeded his orders, Blake, upon submitting his report to Cromwell, found him most gracious and appreciative of his efforts. At this time Blake received orders to proceed off Cadiz, and carry on hostilities against Spain, with the objective of intercepting the Plate ships and to intercept reinforcements intended for Spanish forces in the West Indies.

===Anglo-Spanish War===

In February 1656 commercial rivalry with Spain was soon turned to war. In the Anglo-Spanish War Blake blockaded Cádiz, during which one of his captains, Richard Stayner, destroyed most of the Spanish plate fleet at the Battle of Cádiz. A galleon of treasure was captured, and the overall loss to Spain was estimated at £2 million. Blake maintained the blockade throughout the winter, the first time the fleet had stayed at sea over winter.

On 20 April 1657 Blake totally destroyed another armed merchant convoy, the Spanish West Indian fleet, in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife—a port so well fortified that it was thought to be impregnable to attack from the sea—for the loss of just one ship. With expert marksmanship Blake&#x27;s artillery successfully laid waste to most of the fort and destroyed or reduced the Spanish fleet to ashes. Although the silver had already been landed, Blake&#x27;s victory delayed its arrival at the royal treasury of the Spanish government and earned the new English Navy respect throughout Europe. As a reward Blake was given an expensive diamond ring by Cromwell. The action also earned him respect 140 years later from Lord Nelson who lost his arm there in a failed attack; in a letter written on 17 April 1797, to Admiral Sir John Jervis, Nelson wrote &quot;I do not reckon myself equal to Blake&quot;, before going on to outline the plans for his own attack.

==Final days and legacy==
On 13 March 1655, Blake, still in active service while aboard the &quot;Naseby&quot;, made out his last will and testament. The first item, consisting of a paragraph, began with, &quot;I bequeath my soul unto the hands of my most merciful Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ...&quot; He left the towns of Bridgwater and Taunton £100 each to be dispersed among their the poor. He left his brother Humphrey his manor house, while leaving his other brothers considerable sums of money. Among other items bequeathed to other family members and friends, he left the gold chain that was awarded him by the Parliament to his nephew Robert, son of his deceased brother.

After again cruising off Cadiz for a while, Blake, aboard his flagship &quot;George&quot; turned for home, but on 7 August 1657 at ten o&#x27;clock in the morning he died of old wounds within sight of Plymouth where a hero&#x27;s welcome was planned for him. After lying in state in the Queen&#x27;s House, Greenwich, he was given a full state funeral moved to Westminster Abbey where the procession they were received by a military guard and saluted with salvoes of artillery before he was interred. Present at the ceremony were Oliver Cromwell and the members of the Council of State (although his internal organs had earlier been buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Plymouth). After the restoration of the Monarchy his body was exhumed in 1661 and placed in a common grave in St Margaret&#x27;s churchyard, adjoining the Abbey, on the orders of the new king, Charles II.

In Westminster Abbey, a stone memorial of Robert Blake, unveiled on 27 February 1945, can be found in the south choir aisle. St Margaret&#x27;s Church, where Blake was reburied, has a stained-glass window depicting Blake&#x27;s life, together with a brass plaque to his memory, unveiled on 18 December 1888. A modern stone memorial to Blake and the other Parliamentarians reburied in the churchyard has been set into the external wall to the left of the main entrance of the church.

In 1926 the house in Bridgwater, where it is believed that Blake was born, was purchased and turned into the Blake Museum, where a room is devoted to him and his exploits.

Blake is one of four maritime figures depicted with a statue on the facade of Deptford Town Hall, in the London Borough of Lewisham. Blake and his flagship &quot;Triumph&quot; are featured on a second class postage stamp issued in 1982.

In 2007 various events took place in Bridgwater, Somerset, from April to September to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the death of Robert Blake. These included a civic ceremony on 8 July 2007 and a 17th-century market on 15 July 2007. In the Royal Navy a series of ships have carried the name HMS &quot;Blake&quot; in honour of the general at sea.

As noted by one of Blake&#x27;s biographers, Blake was responsible for the &quot;... birth of a real British Navy ... Hitherto, expeditions had been entrusted to Court favourites, whose main inspiration was not patriotism, but gain; now, patriotism, not profit, was to be its watchword; glory, not gold, its
reward.&quot;

==Relatives==
Blake&#x27;s brother, Benjamin Blake (1614–1689), served under Robert, emigrated to Carolina in 1682, and was the father of Joseph Blake, governor of South Carolina in 1694 and from 1696 to 1700.

Blake&#x27;s brother Samual Blake fought under Popham before being killed in a duel in 1645.

A collateral relative was the historian Robert Blake, Baron Blake (1916–2003).

<text>Robert Blake (born Michael James Gubitosi; September 18, 1933 – March 9, 2023), billed early in his career as Mickey Gubitosi and Bobby Blake, was an American actor. He was best known for starring in the 1967 film &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, playing the title role in the late 1970s television series &quot;Baretta&quot;, and playing the Mystery Man in the 1997 film &quot;Lost Highway&quot;.

Blake began his career in the 1930s performing as a child alongside his family in song and as a dancer but became famous as a child actor, with his lead role in the final years of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer-era of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; (&quot;Little Rascals&quot;) short film series from 1939 to 1944. He also appeared as a child actor in 22 entries of the &quot;Red Ryder&quot; film franchise. In the &quot;Red Ryder&quot; series and in many of his adult roles, the Italian-American actor was often cast as an American Indian or Latino character. After a stint in the U.S. Army, Blake returned to acting in both television and movie roles. Blake continued acting until 1997&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. Owing to Blake&#x27;s becoming one of the first child actors to successfully transition to mature roles as an adult, author Michael Newton called his career &quot;one of the longest in Hollywood history&quot;.

Blake was arrested in 2002 for the 2001 murder of his second wife, Bonny Lee Bakley. Blake was acquitted of the murder in criminal court in 2005, though he was found liable in a civil court for her wrongful death.

==Early life==
Blake was born Michael James Gubitosi in Nutley, New Jersey, on September 18, 1933. His parents were Giacomo (James) Gubitosi (1906–1956) and his wife, Elizabeth Cafone (1910–1991). In 1930, James worked as a die setter for a can manufacturer. Eventually, Blake&#x27;s parents began a song-and-dance act. In 1936, their three children began performing, billed as &quot;The Three Little Hillbillies.&quot; They moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1938, where the children began working as movie extras.

Blake had an unhappy childhood in which he was abused by his alcoholic father. When he entered public school at age 10, he was bullied and had fights with other students, which led to his expulsion. Blake later stated that he was physically and sexually abused by both of his parents while growing up and was frequently locked in a closet and forced to eat off the floor as punishment. At age 14, he ran away from home, leading to several more difficult years. His father died by suicide in 1956. He refused to attend his father&#x27;s funeral.
==Child actor==
Then known as Mickey Gubitosi, Blake began his acting career as Toto in the MGM movie &quot;Bridal Suite&quot; (1939), starring Annabella and Robert Young. Blake then began appearing in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects (a.k.a. &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;) under his real name, replacing Eugene &quot;Porky&quot; Lee. He appeared in 40 of the shorts between 1939 and 1944, eventually becoming the series&#x27; final lead character. Blake&#x27;s parents also made appearances in the series as extras. In &quot;Our Gang&quot;, Blake&#x27;s character, Mickey, was often called upon to cry, for which he was criticized for being unconvincing. He was also criticized for being obnoxious and whiny.

In 1942, he acquired the stage name Bobby Blake and scored his first starring role in a feature film, playing the title role in the MGM feature &quot;Mokey&quot;. Donna Reed also starred as Mokey&#x27;s mother, and Billie &quot;Buckwheat&quot; Thomas, who co-starred in &quot;Our Gang&quot; alongside Blake, played Mokey&#x27;s friend Brother Cumby. After the changing of his stage name, Blake&#x27;s character in &quot;Our Gang&quot; was renamed &quot;Mickey Blake.&quot; Blake also appeared as &quot;Tooky&quot; Stedman in the 1942 film &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Double Life&quot;.

In 1944, MGM discontinued &quot;Our Gang&quot;, releasing the final short in the series, &quot;Dancing Romeo&quot;. In 1995, Blake was honored by the Young Artist Foundation with its Former Child Star &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; Award for his role in &quot;Our Gang&quot;.

In 1944, Blake began playing a Native American boy, &quot;Little Beaver,&quot; in the &quot;Red Ryder&quot; Western series at the studios of Republic Pictures (now CBS Radford Studios), appearing in twenty-three of the movies until 1947. He also had roles in one of Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s later films &quot;The Big Noise&quot; (1944), and the Warner Bros. movies &quot;Humoresque&quot; (1946), playing John Garfield&#x27;s character as a child, and &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948), playing the Mexican boy who sells Humphrey Bogart a winning lottery ticket and gets a glass of water thrown in his face by Bogart in the process. In 1950, at age 17, Blake appeared as Mahmoud in &quot;The Black Rose&quot; and as Enrico, Naples Bus Boy (uncredited) in &quot;Black Hand&quot;.

==Career as an adult==
In 1950, Blake was drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War. Upon leaving at the age of 21, he found himself without any job prospects and fell into a deep depression. This led to a two-year addiction to heroin and cocaine. He also sold drugs. Blake entered Jeff Corey&#x27;s acting class and began working on improving his personal and professional life. He eventually became a seasoned Hollywood actor, playing notable dramatic roles in movies and on television. In 1956, he was billed as Robert Blake for the first time.

In 1959, Blake turned down the role of Little Joe Cartwright, a character ultimately portrayed by Michael Landon, in NBC&#x27;s Western television series &quot;Bonanza.&quot; He did appear that year as Tobe Hackett in the episode &quot;Trade Me Deadly&quot; of the syndicated Western series &quot;26 Men,&quot; which dramatized true stories of the Arizona Rangers. Blake also appeared twice as &quot;Alfredo&quot; in the syndicated Western &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; and starred in &quot;The White Hat&quot; episode of &quot;Men of Annapolis,&quot; another syndicated series. He appeared in three distinctive guest lead roles in the CBS series &quot;Have Gun Will Travel&quot;, as well as one-time guest roles on John Payne&#x27;s NBC Western &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;, Nick Adams&#x27;s ABC Western &quot;The Rebel&quot;, and in season 3, episode 25 of &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, the NBC Western series &quot;The Californians&quot;, the short-lived ABC adventure series &quot;Straightaway&quot;, and the NBC Western television series &quot;Laramie&quot;.

Blake performed in numerous motion pictures as an adult, including the starring role in &quot;The Purple Gang&quot; (1960), a gangster movie, and featured roles in &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; (1959) and, as one of four U.S. soldiers participating in a gang rape in occupied Germany, in &quot;Town Without Pity&quot; (1961). He appeared in the John F. Kennedy war biopic &quot;PT 109&quot; as Charles &quot;Bucky&quot; Harris (1963). He was also in &quot;Ensign Pulver&quot; (1964), &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), and other films. Blake garnered further exposure as a member of the ensemble cast of the 1963 acclaimed but short-lived &quot;The Richard Boone Show&quot;, appearing in fifteen of the NBC series&#x27; 25 episodes.

Boone introduced Blake to entertainment attorney Louis L. Goldman, whom Blake credited with putting him on a successful career path:
&quot;Lou was Cus D&#x27;Amato. He took me under his wing. He said, ‘Robert, you have to listen to me. Otherwise you’re never going to make it.&#x27; And somehow he had the emotional and the psychological wherewithal to get me to respect and love him. And he kept me out of the courtrooms. Many’s the time he went back in the judge&#x27;s chambers and drug me back there and solved the problem that was going to turn into a nightmare. [He&#x27;d] [c]ome on the set and handle things; once [he went] to Lew Wasserman’s office and said, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll handle it, I’ll fix it&#x27;... For some reason or other, I listened to him. When I was with him I was like a little boy. And I would apologize. I’d say ‘God, Lou, I’m sorry.’ He had a way of getting to your heart so that the junkyard dog was not there with him. And he took care of all of us in that way. I was very lucky.&quot;
In 1967, Blake experienced a career breakout due to his work in the film &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;. Blake played real-life murderer Perry Smith, whom he physically resembled. Richard Brooks received two Oscar nominations for the film: one for his direction, and one for his adaptation of Truman Capote&#x27;s book. With &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, Blake was the first actor to utter the expletive &quot;bullshit&quot; in a mainstream American motion picture.
Blake played a Native American fugitive in &quot;Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here&quot; (1969), starred in a TV movie adaptation of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1981), and played a motorcycle highway patrolman in iconoclastic &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot; (1973). He played a small-town stock car driver with ambitions to join the NASCAR circuit in &quot;Corky, &quot; which MGM produced in 1972. The film featured real NASCAR drivers, including Richard Petty and Cale Yarborough as themselves.

Blake may be best known for his Emmy Award–winning role of Tony Baretta in the popular television series &quot;Baretta&quot; (1975 to 1978), playing a street-wise, plain clothes police detective. The show&#x27;s trademarks included Baretta&#x27;s pet cockatoo &quot;Fred&quot; and his signature phrases—notably &quot;That&#x27;s the name of that tune&quot;, and &quot;You can take that to the bank.&quot;

After &quot;Baretta&quot; ended, NBC offered to produce several pilot episodes of a proposed series titled &quot;Joe Dancer&quot;, in which Blake would play the role of a hard-boiled private detective. In addition to starring, Blake also was credited as the executive producer and creator. Three television films aired on NBC in 1981 and 1983, but a television series of &quot;Joe Dancer&quot; never materialized.

Blake had starring roles in a couple of films for Paramount Pictures, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (1980) and &quot;Second-Hand Hearts&quot; (1981). He continued to act through the 1980s and 1990s, mostly in television, in such roles as Jimmy Hoffa in the miniseries &quot;Blood Feud&quot; (1983) and as John List in the murder drama &quot;Judgment Day: The John List Story&quot; (1993), which earned him a third Emmy nomination. Blake starred in the 1985 television series &quot;Hell Town&quot;, playing a priest working in a tough neighborhood, and wrote the screenplay for the pilot as Lyman P. Docker. He also had character parts in the theatrical movies &quot;Money Train&quot; (1995) and played the Mystery Man in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997), which turned out to be his last film role.

==Marriages and children==
Blake and actress Sondra Kerr were married in 1961, and divorced in 1983. It was his first marriage, from which came two children: actor Noah Blake (born 1965) and Delinah Blake (born 1966).

In 1999, eight years after his attorney Louis L. Goldman&#x27;s death, Blake met Bonny Lee Bakley, formerly of Wharton, New Jersey, who had already been married nine times and reportedly had a history of exploiting older men, especially celebrities, for money. She was dating Christian Brando, the son of Marlon Brando, during her relationship with Blake. Bakley became pregnant and told both Brando and Blake that her baby was theirs. Initially, Bakley named the baby &quot;Christian Shannon Brando&quot; and stated that Brando was the father. Bakley wrote letters describing her dubious motives to Blake. Blake insisted that she take a DNA test to prove the paternity. Blake became Bakley&#x27;s tenth husband on November 19, 2000, after DNA tests proved that Blake was the biological father of Bakley&#x27;s youngest child. After paternity was established, the child&#x27;s name was legally changed to Rose Lenore Sophia Blake; after the murder, the child was designated to be raised by Blake&#x27;s daughter Delinah. Blake remained married to Bakley until she was murdered on May 4, 2001.

In a March 2016 interview at age 82, Blake indicated he had a new woman in his life, who remained unnamed. In 2017, Blake applied for a marriage license for his fiancée, Pamela Hudak, an event planner whom he had known for decades, and who had testified on his behalf at his trial. On December 7, 2018, it was announced that Blake had filed for divorce.

==Murder of Bonny Lee Bakley==
On May 4, 2001, Blake took Bakley out for dinner at Vitello&#x27;s Italian Restaurant in Studio City, California. Bakley was fatally shot in the head while sitting in Blake&#x27;s vehicle, which was parked on a side street around the corner from the restaurant. Blake claimed that he had returned to the restaurant to collect a pistol which he had left inside and said that he had not been present when the shooting took place. The pistol Blake left in the restaurant was found and determined by police not to be the murder weapon.

===Arrest===

On April 18, 2002, Blake was arrested and charged with Bakley&#x27;s murder. His longtime bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, was also arrested and charged with conspiracy in connection with the murder. A key event that gave the Los Angeles Police Department the confidence to arrest Blake came when a retired stuntman, Ronald &quot;Duffy&quot; Hambleton, agreed to testify against him. Hambleton alleged that Blake tried to hire him to kill Bakley. Another retired stuntman and an associate of Hambleton&#x27;s, Gary McLarty, also came forward with a similar story. According to author Miles Corwin, Hambleton had agreed to testify against Blake only after being told that he would be subject to a grand jury subpoena and a misdemeanor charge.

On April 22, 2002, Blake was charged with one count of murder with special circumstances, an offense which carried a possible death penalty. He was also charged with two counts of solicitation of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Blake entered a plea of not guilty. On March 13, 2003, after almost a year in jail, Blake was granted bail, which was set at $1.5 million. He was then placed under house arrest while awaiting trial. On October 31, in a major reversal for the prosecution, the judge dismissed the conspiracy charges against Blake and Caldwell during a pre-trial hearing. The junior prosecutor who handled the case, Shellie Samuels, was interviewed by CBS reporter Peter Van Sant for the CBS program &quot;48 Hours Investigates&quot;. During the interview, broadcast in November 2003, she admitted that the prosecutors had no forensic evidence implicating Blake in the murder and that they could not tie him to the murder weapon.

===Trial and acquittal===
Blake&#x27;s criminal trial for murder began on December 20, 2004, with opening statements by the prosecution and opening statements by the defense the following day. The prosecution contended that Blake intentionally murdered Bakley to free himself from a loveless marriage, while the defense claimed that Blake was an innocent victim of circumstantial and fabricated evidence. McLarty and Hambleton each testified that Blake had asked them to murder Bakley. On cross-examination, the defense brought up McLarty&#x27;s mental health problems and Hambleton&#x27;s criminal history. The lack of gunshot residue on Blake&#x27;s hands was a key part of the defense&#x27;s case that Blake was not the shooter. Blake chose not to testify.

On March 16, 2005, Blake was found not guilty of murder and not guilty of one of the two counts of solicitation of murder. The other count, for solicitation to commit murder, was dropped after it was revealed that the jury was deadlocked 11–1 in favor of an acquittal. Los Angeles County District Attorney Stephen Cooley, commenting on this ruling, called Blake &quot;a miserable human being&quot; and the jurors &quot;incredibly stupid&quot; to fall for the defense&#x27;s claims. Public opinion regarding the verdict was mixed, with some feeling that Blake was guilty, though many felt that there was not enough evidence to convict him. On the night of his acquittal several fans celebrated at Blake&#x27;s favorite haunt – and the scene of the crime – Vitello&#x27;s.

===Civil case===
Bakley&#x27;s three children filed a civil suit against Blake, asserting that he was responsible for their mother&#x27;s death. During the trial, the girlfriend of Blake&#x27;s co-defendant Earle Caldwell said she believed Blake and Caldwell were involved in the crime.

On November 18, 2005, a jury found Blake liable for the wrongful death of his wife and ordered him to pay $30 million. On February 3, 2006, Blake filed for bankruptcy.

Blake&#x27;s attorney, M. Gerald Schwartzbach, appealed the court&#x27;s decision on February 28, 2007. On April 26, 2008, an appeals court upheld the civil case verdict, but cut Blake&#x27;s penalty assessment to $15 million.

===Aftermath===
Blake maintained a low profile after his acquittal and filing for bankruptcy, with debts of $3 million for unpaid legal fees as well as state and federal taxes. On April 9, 2010, the state of California filed a tax lien against Blake for $1,110,878 in unpaid back taxes.

On July 16, 2012, Blake was interviewed on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot;. When asked about the night of Bakley&#x27;s murder, Blake became defensive and angry, stating he resented Morgan&#x27;s questioning and felt he was being interrogated. Morgan responded he was only asking questions that he felt people were eager to have answered.

In January 2019, Blake was interviewed by &quot;20/20&quot;. Initially, he seemed to decline the interview and instead delegated it to a friend, but then began to participate, discussing the murder and the behavior of the police officers who dealt with him, the culture of Hollywood and its reaction to the event, and his early life and difficulties with his parents.

In September 2019, Blake started a YouTube channel titled &quot;Robert Blake: I ain&#x27;t dead yet, so stay tuned,&quot; on which he discussed his life and career.

Later in October the same year, Blake&#x27;s daughter, Rose Lenore, opened up about her childhood and how the trial affected her. She discussed reuniting with her father, visiting her mother&#x27;s grave and her own desire to get into acting. Regarding knowing the truth about her mother&#x27;s murder and whether Blake did it she declined to know the details but is open to knowing the truth &quot;If it&#x27;s ever an option&quot;.

In 2021, Blake opened up a website, &quot;Robert Blake&#x27;s Pushcart&quot;, where scripts, memorabilia, and books including his autobiography &quot;Tales of a Rascal&quot; are available to read and in the case of the latter can be ordered.

Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s novel &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, based on his film of the same name, is dedicated to Blake. Notably, Blake&#x27;s later life dealing with his wife&#x27;s murder mirrors Brad Pitt&#x27;s character Cliff Booth who is also accused of murdering his wife.

==Death==
Blake died from heart disease in Los Angeles, on March 9, 2023, aged 89.

Comedian Jimmy Kimmel made a comment at the 95th Academy Awards on March 12, 2023, after Blake&#x27;s death. On the topic of whether or not Blake should be included in the annual &quot;In Memoriam&quot; montage, Kimmel stated, &quot;Everybody please get out your phones, even at home, it&#x27;s time to vote. If you think Robert Blake should be part of the In Memoriam montage, text &#x27;GIMME-A-Blake&#x27; to the number on your screen, or to any number.&quot; Blake was not mentioned during the televised &quot;In Memoriam&quot; portion of the ceremony. Blake&#x27;s son Noah criticized the omission of his father&#x27;s name and career. Blake was also left out of the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; montage at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards. Blake was featured in the 2023 &#x27;TCM Remembers&#x27; montage, an annual tribute to the film industry&#x27;s dearly departed by Turner Classic Movies.

<text>Trygve Halvdan Lie ( , ; 16 July 1896 – 30 December 1968) was a Norwegian politician, labour leader, government official and author. He served as Norwegian foreign minister during the critical years of the Norwegian government in exile in London from 1940 to 1945. From 1946 to 1952 he was the first secretary-general of the United Nations.

==Early life==
Lie was born in Kristiania (now Oslo) on 16 July 1896. His father, carpenter Martin Lie, left the family to emigrate to the United States in 1902 and was never heard from again. Trygve grew up under poor conditions together with his mother Hulda and a sister who was six at the time. His mother ran a boarding house and café in Grorud in Oslo.

Lie joined the Labour Party in 1911 and was named as the party&#x27;s national secretary soon after receiving his law degree from the University of Oslo in 1919. Lie was editor-in-chief for &quot;Det 20de Aarhundre&quot; (&#x27;The 20th Century&#x27;) from 1919 to 1921. From 1922 to 1935 he was a legal consultant for the Workers&#x27; National Trade Union (named Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions from 1957). During this period, he acquired a reputation for settling disputes early and bringing test cases before the courts. He chaired the Norwegian Workers&#x27; Confederation of Sports from 1931 to 1935.

==Political career==
In local politics he served as a member of the executive committee of Aker municipality council from 1922 to 1931. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from Akershus in 1937. He was appointed minister of justice when a Labour Party government was formed by Johan Nygaardsvold in 1935. Lie was later appointed minister of trade (July to October 1939) and minister of supplies (October 1939 to 1941).

A socialist from an early age, Lie once met Vladimir Lenin while on a Labour Party visit to Moscow and gave permission for Leon Trotsky to settle in Norway after he was exiled from the Soviet Union. However, because of pressure from Joseph Stalin, he forced Trotsky to leave the country.

When Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Lie ordered all Norwegian ships to sail to Allied ports. In 1941, Lie was named as foreign minister of the Norwegian government-in-exile, and he remained in this position until 1946.

===United Nations career===
Lie led the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations conference in San Francisco in 1945 and was a leader in drafting the provisions of the United Nations Security Council. He was the leader of the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1946. Lie first stood for the election for president of the General Assembly but lost to Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium. After in January 1946 the Soviet Union opposed the Canadian candidate Lester B. Pearson due to him being a North American and the UN headquarters were also in North America, and the United States opposed both Soviet candidates, those being the Yugoslav ambassador to Washington Stanoye Simic and Wincenty Rzymowski, the foreign minister of Poland, the United States eventually produced Lie as the candidate, to which both powers agreed. He was elected as the first secretary-general of the United Nations by a unanimous vote in the Security Council and by a 46–3 vote in the General Assembly. As the first person to occupy the new position, he would help come to shape the role as it developed in international diplomacy.

As secretary-general, Lie appointed, among others, Jan Pedersen, Raymond Fourier, Oskar Larsen and a wide variety of officials to the positions of under-secretaries-general or special advisors during his tenure, with a tendency to prefer individuals he had previously worked with. Lie supported the foundations of Israel and Indonesia. His passionate support for Israel included passing secret military and diplomatic information to Israeli officials. He sent 50 members of the United Nations guard force from Lake Success to assist the mediator in supervising the truce in the former British Mandate of Palestine in 1948, and the &quot;UNTSO&quot;, the first peacekeeping operation, was established by the United Nations. He worked for the withdrawal of Soviet forces in Iran during the Iran crisis of 1946 and a ceasefire in fighting in Kashmir. Regarding Iran, Lies&#x27; memorandum on a potential solution was not implemented, but, as a result of the need for raising important issues, the Security Council changed its rules of procedures to enable the secretary general to address it on any question under consideration. This change would have important consequences both for Lie with regards to the Korean War as well as for later secretaries-general.

Lie advocated for the creation of the UN Guard, a non-military force of &quot;1,000–5,000 men, largely drawn from the smaller member states, to be recruited by the Secretary-General and placed at the disposal of the Security Council, the General Assembly, and the Trusteeship Council.&quot;

In 1948, Lie was involved in mediation attempts between Russia and the West following the Berlin Blockade. In June 1948, he offered to raise the blockade to the UN Security Council as a &#x27;threat to the peace&#x27; but was told by the US State Department that this was not necessary. In November 1948, he recommended that the UN attempt to work out the currency issue and present a solution to both sides. However, in this regard he was not successful, as Stalin eventually ordered the lifting of the blockade in May 1949 in response to the effects of a trade embargo and the subsequent ongoing success of the Allied airlift operation.

Lie was Secretary-General of the UN during the period of the Korean War. Following the June 25, 1950, attack by North Korean forces, Lie immediately invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter to convene the Security Council that day. He stated that as Korea was a ward of the UN, the invasion was an attack on the UN itself and that the Security Council should take the necessary steps to reestablish peace. A resolution to that effect passed in the Council by 9–0, owing to the absence of the Soviet Union due to their boycott of the council owing to the absence of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is stated that this attracted the ire of the Soviet Union. During the war, Lie had wanted an international committee to direct military forces, but this was opposed by the US, and a compromise was reached whereby a unified UN command would be created but under the overall command of a US general. He has been criticised by some for his failures to bring about a swifter end to the Korean War, despite several repeated attempts to bring the People&#x27;s Republic of China to ceasefire negotiations.

On 1 November 1950, over objections by the Soviet Union, the UN General Assembly voted by 46 votes to five (and eight abstentions) to extend Lie&#x27;s term of office. The vote was a consequence of an impasse in the Security Council in which the Soviet Union refused to consider Lie due to his involvement in the Korean War, while the US refused to accept any candidate except Lie. Lie later worked to end the Soviet boycott of UN meetings, though his involvement had little to do with the eventual return of the Soviet Union to the UN. He was opposed to Spain&#x27;s entry into the United Nations because of his opposition to Francisco Franco&#x27;s government. He also sought to have the People&#x27;s Republic of China recognized by the United Nations after the Nationalist government was exiled to Taiwan, arguing that the People&#x27;s Republic was the only government that could fulfill the membership obligations in full.

By late 1952, the USSR continued to refuse to acknowledge Lie as secretary-general and, having also been accused by Joseph McCarthy of hiring &quot;disloyal&quot; Americansan allegation that he attributed to the pressing need for UN civil servants following the establishment of the UNLie resigned on 10 November 1952.

The UN came under US official scrutiny after the conviction of Alger Hiss, who had served as acting secretary general at the first convening of the UN in San Francisco (in 1945). A State Department report dated 17 January 1951, states:

&quot;Subject: McCarran Act—Possible Conflict with Headquarters Agreement&quot;In conversation with Abe Feller in New York recently he expressed the view that the regulations which have been issued under the McCarran Act make it fairly clear to him that there is likely to be some conflict between that Act and the way in which it is being interpreted and the Headquarters Agreement. He expressed the view that in the event of such conflict the UN secretariat would be forced to resort to the arbitration procedure under the Agreement. He stated he thought this would be very unfortunate and wondered whether any consideration was being given to a general amendment to the McCarran Act which would waive its provisions so far as it conflicted with international obligations or international agreements. I told him I did not know whether any amendments were under consideration but that I would bring his view to your attention.

Abraham Feller, general counsel and principal director, Legal Department, United Nations Secretariat, was reportedly a close friend of Alger Hiss. On 14 November 1952, just days after Lie&#x27;s resignation from the UN, Feller died by suicide, jumping out of the window of his apartment in New York City.

===After the United Nations===
Lie remained active in Norwegian politics after his resignation from the UN. He was the county governor of Oslo and Akershus, chairman of the Board of Energy, minister of industry, and minister of trade and shipping. He wrote a number of books, including &quot;In the Cause of Peace&quot;, an account of his years at the UN.

==Personal life and death==
Lie married Hjørdis Jørgensen (1898–1960) in 1921. The couple had three daughters: Sissel, Guri, and Mette.

Lie died on 30 December 1968 of a heart attack in Geilo, Norway. He was 72 years old.

==Awards==
Trygve Lie was awarded a large number of Norwegian and foreign orders. Among these were the Norwegian highest civilian award Medal for Outstanding Civic Service (&quot;Medaljen for borgerdåd)&quot; (1966), the Grand Cross of the Order of Dannebrog (1954) and Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav (1953), and the Czechoslovak OWL (1948). He was awarded numerous honorary doctorates by universities throughout the U.S. and Europe. Trygve Lie was the holder of a number of other orders, decorations and other honors.

==Legacy==
Some scholars rank him at the bottom of all UN secretaries-general; one who &quot;presided over a long list of diplomatic failures, tarnished the UN, and accomplished very little&quot;. On the other hand, some scholars argue that Trygve Lie built the United Nations organisation from nothing, with the organization establishing a physical presence in a huge office building in New York, after having started in a small temporary office on Long Island. This included leading the UN response to a number of challenging post–World War II conflicts and issues related to the wider Cold War. As the first secretary-general of the UN, Lie would have a pivotal role in first helping shape that position as well as of the wider role of the UN.

&quot;Trygve Lie&#x27;s Square&quot; is located in Furuset center in Oslo. In the square stands the bronze statue of Trygve Lie, which was created by the Norwegian artist Nicolaus Widerberg and erected in 1994. Trygve Lie Gallery and Trygve Lie Plaza are both located in New York City.

<doc id="240552" wikidata="Q171320" url="?curid=240552" title="British American Racing">
<text>British American Racing (BAR) was a Formula One constructor that competed in the sport from 1999 to 2005. BAR began by acquiring Tyrrell, and used Supertec engines for their first year. Subsequently, they formed a partnership with Honda which lasted for the next six years.

The team was named after British American Tobacco plc (BAT), which owned and sponsored it in order to display its Lucky Strike and 555 brands. The headquarters were in Brackley, Northamptonshire, United Kingdom.

In mid-November 2004, Japanese automobile manufacturer Honda purchased 45% of the team, and in September 2005, purchased the remaining 55% share to become the sole owner. Consequently, BAR Honda became Honda Racing F1 Team for the 2006 Formula One season. BAT continued as title sponsor with the Lucky Strike brand, but due to new tobacco advertising regulations worldwide, pulled its sponsorship from Formula One entirely at the end of the 2006 season.

Honda ran the team for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 seasons. During 2008, the Honda RA109 was being developed for the following year while Honda attempted to sell the team. A management buy-out by team principal Ross Brawn and an engine supply deal with Mercedes-Benz resulted in a remarkable 2009 season in which Brawn GP team won the Constructors&#x27; Championship with Jenson Button winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Mercedes bought the team in November 2009 and , the team competes as Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team.

== History ==
British American Tobacco (BAT) had been involved in Formula One for many years, with several of its brands being displayed on F1 cars run by various teams.

In 1997, the corporation was convinced by Craig Pollock to provide most of the equity to purchase the Tyrrell Formula One team for £30 million. Pollock, Adrian Reynard and Rick Gorne were the minority partners. The deal was announced on 2 December 1997. The team was still officially known as Tyrrell in 1998, before it became BAR the following year.
=== Preparations ===
On 23 July 1998, BAR announced the signing of 1997 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve away from Williams with a lucrative contract for the 1999 season. Pollock had managed Villeneuve throughout his racing career. Villeneuve was joined by F1 rookie Ricardo Zonta. The car&#x27;s chassis was built by Reynard Motorsport at a new factory in Brackley and was powered by Supertec (rebadged Renault) engines.

At the launch of their new car, BAR unveiled separate liveries for their cars; Villeneuve&#x27;s car painted in a white and red Lucky Strike livery and Zonta&#x27;s carrying a blue and yellow 555 livery. The FIA deemed the dual liveries illegal under F1 regulations which state that a team&#x27;s cars must carry largely identical liveries. BAR lodged a complaint with the International Chamber of Commerce (as permitted under F1&#x27;s regulations) but simultaneously lodged a complaint with the European Commission. Pollock was summoned to the World Motor Sport Council to explain the team&#x27;s behaviour. A potential fine and/or ban was averted when Pollock agreed to abide by the F1 arbitration process, admitted that in filing the complaint to the EC his lawyers had acted independently and that declarations made in the claim did not reflect his personal views. He also apologised to the Council and reiterated his acceptance of the FIA&#x27;s authority. To get around the ban, BAR ran one side of their cars painted in the Lucky Strike colours, and the other side in the blue and yellow of 555. BAR reverted to a more traditional style of livery for 2000 onwards.

BAR had the slogan of &quot;A tradition of excellence&quot;, which was viewed as humorous by pundits as the team had no history and therefore no such tradition at all. Adrian Reynard also made an ambitious claim that the team would win a race in their debut season.

===1999===

In a disastrous maiden season, BAR failed to score a single point in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, being the only one of the eleven teams that season not to do so. The car was relatively quick and often qualified in the midfield, as seen especially in the Spanish Grand Prix, where Villeneuve had briefly been in third place ahead of the Ferraris before pitting in.

However, the car suffered from chronic reliability issues, resulting in many instances of the car failing to finish the race. This was especially the case of Villeneuve, who started the season with 11 straight retirements before his first race finish of the season at Belgium, only to twice more fail to finish the race in the European and Malaysian Grands Prix later on. The Belgian event was notable also for both Villeneuve and Zonta having similar serious crashes during qualifying sessions, reportedly as a result of the drivers betting they could take the famous Eau Rouge corner flat.

Zonta sustained an injury during practice for the Brazilian Grand Prix and was unable to participate in qualifying for the race. He was also forced to miss out on the next three races due to that injury. Mika Salo, who filled in for Zonta in those three races, provided the team with its season best finish of 7th at San Marino (although Salo himself did not reach the chequered flag at the end of the race).

=== 2000===

During the 1999 season, BAR announced that Honda had become their engine supplier beginning in 2000. The Honda deal not only meant they would supply engines, but that Honda staff would work with the team at their Brackley base as well as received full-factory support from Honda including official team vehicles and free engines. Honda had planned to enter Formula One as a factory team, but relented due to Harvey Postlethwaite&#x27;s untimely death at the beginning of the previous year. It was the first time Honda had been directly involved in Formula One since 1992. BAR did not have exclusive use of Honda engines though, as Jordan Grand Prix also used Mugen Honda power units. The following year, Jordan were given factory Honda engines, but the engine manufacturers could not supply two teams forever. This prompted a battle between BAR and Jordan for the use of Honda engines in the long term.

The car was once again designed in co-operation with Adrian Reynard despite talk of tension between him and team principal Craig Pollock. At the launch of the 002 car, Pollock himself described the 2000 season as a chance to &quot;wipe the slate clean&quot; following their awful first season and admitted that the team had made many mistakes in their first season.

In 2000, the new Honda powered BAR did show a significant improvement. It proved to be considerably more reliable than the team&#x27;s previous effort, but the team still only had a best finish of 4th and the victory they had promised in 1999 still eluded them. At the end of the season, the team finished 5th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. The progression and improvement of the team was enough to convince Villeneuve to remain at the team.

===2001===

Villeneuve reached the podium twice in 2001 for BAR, but neither he nor his new teammate Olivier Panis&#x27;s results were consistent enough.

===2002===

Under pressure from British American Tobacco, Pollock resigned on the eve of the launch of the 2002 car and was replaced as team principal by David Richards. Richards&#x27; Prodrive company was also awarded a five-year management contract to run BAR. BAT and Prodrive had a prior relationship with BAT sponsoring Subaru&#x27;s World Rally Championship team, operated by Prodrive.

2002 was a transient season for BAR. A significant proportion of the workforce was culled while technical director Malcolm Oastler and designer Andy Green left. Villeneuve still struggled to score points and Panis also failing to reach expectations. BAR signed a deal to become Honda&#x27;s only team in 2003, despite finishing behind Honda&#x27;s other team, Jordan, in both 2001 and 2002.

===2003===
BAR brought in Jenson Button to replace Panis for the 2003 Formula One season. Villeneuve&#x27;s contract negotiation arguments with David Richards eventually ended with him being replaced before the end of the season by Japanese driver Takuma Sato. Honda has traditionally liked its teams to field Japanese drivers for publicity reasons in its home country. Jenson Button led a race for the first time at the 2003 United States Grand Prix. The team struggled due to its use of Bridgestone tyres. In the off-season they changed to rival company Michelin.

=== Peak in 2004 ===
Early in 2004, the team saw a further upswing in its fortunes, Button scoring many podium finishes. He also took their first pole position at San Marino. BAR finished the season in 2nd place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, beating every team except for Ferrari. Despite this, BAR&#x27;s first win still eluded them.

During the course of the 2004 season, a dispute with WilliamsF1 threatened to overshadow BAR&#x27;s on-track performance. Both teams believed they had a valid contract for Button in 2005. The issue finally went to the Contract Recognition Board, which found in favour of BAR. Button was to drive for BAR in 2005, but signed a contract to join Williams for 2006.

With increasing restrictions being placed upon tobacco companies&#x27; opportunities to advertise in Formula One, rumours suggested that BAT would try to sell the team. In mid-November 2004, BAR announced that Honda had purchased 45% and, as part of the deal, David Richards left to be replaced by Nick Fry as team principal. Prodrive&#x27;s management contract was also terminated early.

=== 2005: Poor start and controversy ===

The start of the 2005 season didn&#x27;t go according to plan for BAR, as they struggled in the &quot;flyaway&quot; races at the start of the season. Just as they became competitive in San Marino, BAR Honda was disqualified for running with illegal cars. The allegation was that the cars were able to race with their total weight below 605 kg (1323 lb), the minimum weight required for a Formula 1 car. BAR disputed this, saying that the engine required a minimum of of fuel to work, thus keeping them above the minimum weight. Their interpretation of the rules was that this limit applies only during the race, not during the post-race scrutineering. The FIA, and later the court, disagreed. In addition to the disqualification, the team was banned for two races, a period which included the lucrative Monaco Grand Prix. The team initially indicated that they planned to fight the decision before a regular civil court but later decided to accept the verdict. Max Mosley, the president of the FIA, saw the sanction as very lenient; he had wanted the team to be banned for the rest of the season. However, they were unable to prove deliberate intent to cheat as they had with BAR&#x27;s predecessor, Tyrrell, in the 1984 season.
When BAR returned at the European Grand Prix, the team struggled to find its feet. In stark contrast to the previous season, BAR failed to score a single point until the midway point, at the 2005 French Grand Prix, not helped by the team&#x27;s use of Michelin tyres causing them to not start the 2005 United States Grand Prix. Takuma Sato had a particularly poor season, scoring just one point, and subsequently, his contract was not renewed by BAR at the end of the season. Sato was replaced in the new Honda team by former Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello. Button scored in each of the last 10 races of the season, culminating in 2 podium positions. Confirmation of this improvement was shown in a skillful pass made by Jenson Button, overtaking Jacques Villeneuve at the fast Pouhon corner at Spa-Francorchamps, in the rain, and around the outside.

At the end of 2005, Honda obtained 100% ownership of BAR from British American Tobacco, completing their ambition to become a full F1 manufacturer team. In addition, Jenson Button&#x27;s Williams contract was bought out for US$30 million, and Button signed a multi-year contract with Honda.

Following the sale of the team to Honda, BAT would return to Formula One in sponsoring McLaren in a &quot;global partnership&quot; agreement under its &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; campaign, relating to electronic cigarettes and related alternative smoking products.

== Speed record attempt ==
BAR tested a modified BAR-Honda 007 car, which they intended to use in an attempt to set the land speed record for a car meeting FIA Formula One regulations. The team aimed for , and had planned to attempt the record at Bonneville Salt Flats. The driver for this project was Alan van der Merwe. The modified chassis performed a shakedown test on the long runway at Mojave Airport in California, on 5 November 2005, under the supervision of safety co-ordinator executive, Jamie Hardwick. The four published times recorded in this test were , , and . However, these tests did not constitute the record attempt itself and waterlogging of the salt flats resulted in the attempt being postponed. The chassis was used by BAR&#x27;s successor, Honda, to set a new record the following year.

<doc id="240559" wikidata="Q1200256" url="?curid=240559" title="Delusional parasitosis">
<text>Delusional parasitosis (DP), also called delusional infestation, is a mental health condition where a person falsely believes that their body is infested with living or nonliving agents. Common examples of such agents include parasites, insects, or bacteria. This is a delusion due to the belief persisting despite evidence that no infestation is present. People with this condition may have skin symptoms such as the urge to pick at one&#x27;s skin (excoriation) or a sensation resembling insects crawling on or under the skin (formication). Morgellons disease is a related constellation of symptoms. This self-diagnosed condition is considered a form of a type of delusional parasitosis. People with Morgellons falsely believe harmful fibers are coming out of their skin and causing wounds.

Delusional parasitosis is classified as a delusional disorder in the fifth revision of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5). The precise cause is unknown. It may be linked to problems with dopamine in the brain, similar to psychotic disorders. Diagnosis requires the delusion to be the only sign of psychosis, not caused by another medical condition, and present for at least a month. A defining characteristic of delusions is that the false belief cannot be corrected. As a result, most affected individuals believe their delusion is true and do not accept treatment. Antipsychotic medications can help with symptom remission. Cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants can also decrease symptoms.

The condition is rare and affects women twice as often as men. The average age of individuals affected by the disorder is 57. Ekbom&#x27;s syndrome is another name for the condition. This name honors the neurologist Karl-Axel Ekbom, who published accounts of the disease in 1937 and 1938.

== Classification ==
Delusional parasitosis is classified as a delusional disorder of the somatic subtype in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM5). Since 2015, the most common name for the disorder is &quot;delusional parasitosis.&quot; The condition has also been called delusional infestation, delusory parasitosis, delusional ectoparasitosis, psychogenic parasitosis, Ekbom syndrome, dermatophobia,parasitophobia, formication and &quot;cocaine bugs&quot;.

Delusional parasitosis can occur in two different forms. The first, primary delusional infestation, is a psychiatric disorder. The second, secondary delusional infestation, is linked to other medical or psychiatric conditions. In contrast, delusory cleptoparasitosis is a delusion where the person believes the infestation is in their home.

Morgellons is a constellation of symptoms considered a form of delusional parasitosis. This self-diagnosed condition is similar to other delusional infestations. People with this condition have painful skin sensations. They believe this is caused by fibers that are present in their lesions. Morgellons disease is not listed in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).

==Signs and symptoms==

People with delusional parasitosis believe that &quot;parasites, worms, mites, bacteria, fungus&quot; or similar organisms have infected them. Reasoning or logic cannot change this fixed, false belief. Symptoms can differ among those with the condition. It often involves a crawling or pin-pricking sensation. Many describe it as a sensation of parasites crawling upon or burrowing into the skin. Sometimes, this includes a physical sensation (known as formication). People with this condition may injure themselves trying to remove the &quot;parasites&quot;. This can lead to skin damage such as excoriation, bruises, and cuts. Moreover, using harsh chemicals or cleaning obsessive can cause further harm.

People with this condition recall events like a bug bite, travel, sharing clothes, or contact with someone they think was infected. These exposures may cause the individual to pay attention to bodily sensations they usually ignore. The individual may then believe these symptoms are due to an infestation. Those affected may see any skin mark or small object on them or their clothing as proof of a parasitic infestation. Those with the condition often collect such &quot;evidence&quot; to present to medical professionals. Medical professionals call this the &quot;matchbox sign&quot;, &quot;Ziploc bag sign&quot; or &quot;specimen sign.&quot; The name stems from the fact that the evidence is typically stored in a small container, like a matchbox. The matchbox sign is present in five to eight out of every ten people with DP. Related is a &quot;digital specimen sign&quot;, in which individuals bring collections of photographs to document their condition.

Similar delusions may be present in close relatives. This is known as a &quot;folie à deux&quot; and it occurs in 5–15% of cases. It is considered a shared psychotic disorder. The internet has created a unique situation where many people can reinforce shared delusions. This has led to the term &quot;folie à Internet&quot; for delusional parasitosis. When those affected are isolated from each other, their symptoms usually improve, but most still need treatment.

Approximately eight out of ten individuals with DP have co-occurring conditions, such as depression, substance use disorders, and anxiety. Their personal and professional lives are frequently disrupted due to extreme distress regarding their symptoms.

== Cause ==
The cause of delusional parasitosis is unknown. Primary delusional parasitosis may result from high dopamine in the brain&#x27;s striatum. This happens from diminished dopamine transporter (DAT) function. The dopamine transporter regulates dopamine reabsorption in the brain. For example, substances that block dopamine reuptake, like cocaine and methylphenidate, can cause symptoms like formication. Additionally, several conditions linked to faulty dopamine transporters can also lead to secondary delusional parasitosis. Examples of such conditions include: &quot;schizophrenia, depression, traumatic brain injury, alcoholism, Parkinson&#x27;s and Huntington&#x27;s diseases, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and iron deficiency&quot;. Providing further support for the dopamine theory, antipsychotics improve DP symptoms. This may be because they affect dopamine transmission.

Secondary delusional parasitosis is caused by another medical or psychiatric disorder. Medical conditions associated with secondary delusional parasitosis include: deficiencies in vitamins such as B12 or folate, thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia, encephalitis, meningitis, and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, some infectious diseases such as HIV and syphilis have also been associated with delusional infestation. Secondary delusional parasitosis is also associated with substance use disorders. The most commonly associated substances include chronic alcohol use, alcohol withdrawal, long-term cocaine use, long-term amphetamine use. Finally, there also a number of prescription drugs that may cause DP as a side effect. These include &quot;phenelzine, pargyline, ketoconazole, corticosteroids, amantadine, ciprofloxacin, pegylated interferon alpha, and topiramate.&quot;

==Diagnosis==
Delusional parasitosis is diagnosed when: 1) the delusion is the only symptom of psychosis, 2) the delusion has lasted a month or longer, 3) the person&#x27;s behavior is otherwise not markedly odd or impaired, 4) mood disorders (if present at any time) have been comparatively brief, and 5) the delusion cannot be better explained by another medical condition, mental disorder, or the effects of a substance. For diagnosis, the individual must attribute abnormal skin sensations to the belief that they have an infestation, and be convinced that they have an infestation even when evidence shows they do not. 

The condition is recognized in two forms: primary and secondary. In primary delusional parasitosis, the delusions are the only manifestation of a psychiatric disorder. Secondary delusional parasitosis occurs when another psychiatric condition, medical illness or substance (prescription or recreational) use causes the symptoms. In secondary delusional infestation, the delusion is a symptom of another condition rather than the disorder itself. Secondary forms of DP can be functional (due to psychiatric disorders) or organic (due to other medical illness or organic disease). The secondary organic form may be related to vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, anemia, hepatitis, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, syphilis, or use of stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine.

The first step in diagnosis is to conduct a comprehensive examination to rule out other causes of the person&#x27;s symptoms. Testing to rule out other conditions fosters trust between the provider and the person affected. To check for parasitic infestations, providers use skin examinations, skin biopsies, dermatologic tests and laboratory analyses. A detailed lab analysis can rule out other causes. Examples of such analyses include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, urinalysis for toxicology and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Tests may also be done for &quot;human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, viral hepatitis, B12 or folate deficiency&quot;, and allergies. Additionally, the provider might review medications that may cause similar symptoms. 

=== Differential ===
Healthcare professionals first distinguish delusional parasitosis from actual infections like scabies or mites. Other possible causes of these symptoms include exposure to agricultural products or fiberglass, pet-induced dermatitis, and moth/caterpillar dermatitis. 

Providers may also check for other related psychiatric conditions. Examples include schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, dementia, delirium, affective or substance-induced psychoses, and medical conditions that cause psychosis. Several drugs may also cause such symptoms, such as amphetamines, dopamine agonists, opioids, and cocaine. Providers may also check for medical conditions that may cause such symptoms. Examples include hypothyroidism, and kidney or liver disease. 

Many of these physiological and environmental factors are capable of inducing a &quot;crawling&quot; sensation. It is considered a delusion when one becomes fixated on the sensation and its possible meaning. This fixation may develop into DP.

==Treatment==
People with delusional parasitosis are not comforted by the lack of evidence for infestation. Additionally, many people will reject the diagnosis of delusional parasitosis. As a result, these people may also reject treatment for the condition. Confronting individuals about delusions is unhelpful because the delusions are not likely to change.

Individuals with delusional infestation often see many providers in different specialties. Treatment guidelines emphasize the importance of gaining the person&#x27;s trust and collaborating with other providers. Dermatologists may have more success introducing the use of a medication as a way to alleviate the distress of itching. 

As of 2019, there have not been any studies that compare available treatments to placebo. The only treatment that provides a cure is low doses of antipsychotic medication. Risperidone is the treatment of choice. In the past, the treatment of choice was pimozide. This treatment has grown out of favor due to a higher side effect profile. Aripiprazole and ziprasidone are effective but have not been well studied for delusional parasitosis. Olanzapine is also effective. Antipsychotics are used at the lowest possible dosage. They are increased gradually until symptoms remit. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has also been effective.

== Prognosis ==
People will often have symptoms for months before being diagnosed. The average duration of the condition is about three years. If not treated, symptoms will typically worsen. People may develop chronic scarring as a result. Antipsychotics or treating the underlying condition may cure delusional parasitosis. 

Delusional parasitosis drastically impacts the lives of those affected. The condition leads to social isolation which can worsen depressive symptoms. Additionally, the condition often affects people&#x27;s self esteem. Depression and suicide risk is elevated in people affected by delusional parasitosis. The condition can also impact the individuals ability to function in their daily life. This can negatively impact employment. 

==Epidemiology==
Delusional parasitosis is a rare disorder. It is the most common of the hypochondriacal psychoses. It is more common than other types of delusions, like those associated with body odor or halitosis. DP is often undetected because those who have the condition may not consult a psychiatrist. This makes it difficult to estimate the number of people with delusional parasitosis. A population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, found a prevalence of 27 per 100,000 person-years and an incidence of almost 2 cases per 100,000 person-years. Other studies have found annual incidence rates to be anywhere from 2-17 cases per 1 million people per year. Of note, the majority of dermatologists will see at least one person with DP during their career.

The condition is observed twice as often in women than men. The highest incidence occurs in people in their 60s. There is also a higher occurrence in people in their 30s, associated with substance use. It occurs most often in &quot;socially isolated&quot; women with an average age of 57. Individuals with DP may be high functioning.

==History==
Karl-Axel Ekbom, a Swedish neurologist, first described delusional parasitosis as &quot;pre-senile delusion of infestation&quot; in 1937. The common name has changed many times since then. Ekbom originally used the German word &quot;dermatozoenwahn&quot;, but other countries used the term &quot;Ekbom&#x27;s syndrome&quot;. That term fell out of favor because it also referred to restless legs syndrome (more specifically termed Willis–Ekbom disease (WED) or Wittmaack-Ekbom syndrome). Other names that referenced &quot;phobia&quot; were rejected because anxiety disorder was not typical of the symptoms. The eponymous Ekbom&#x27;s disease was changed to &quot;delusions of parasitosis&quot; in 1946 in the English literature, when researchers J Wilson and H Miller described a series of cases, and to &quot;delusional infestation&quot; in 2009. The most common name since 2015 has been &quot;delusional parasitosis&quot;.

Ekbom&#x27;s original was translated to English in 2003; the authors hypothesized that James Harrington (1611–1677) may have been the &quot;first recorded person to suffer from such delusions when he &#x27;began to imagine that his sweat turned to flies, and sometimes to bees and other insects&#x27;.&quot;

=== Morgellons ===

Mary Leitao, the founder of the Morgellons Research Foundation, coined the name &quot;Morgellons&quot; in 2002, reviving it from a letter written by a physician in the mid-1600s. Leitao and others involved in her foundation (who self-identified as having Morgellons) successfully lobbied members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the condition in 2006. The CDC published the results of its multi-year study in January 2012. The study found no underlying infectious condition and few disease organisms were present in people with Morgellons; the fibers found were likely cotton, and the condition was &quot;similar to more commonly recognized conditions such as delusional infestation&quot;.

Since the early 2000s, a strong internet presence has led to increasing self-diagnosis of Morgellons. An active online community has supported the notion that Morgellons is an infectious disease, and propose an association with Lyme disease. Publications &quot;largely from a single group of investigators&quot; describe findings of spirochetes, keratin and collagen in skin samples of a small number of individuals; these findings are contradicted by the much larger studies conducted by the CDC.

== Society and culture ==
Jay Traver (1894–1974), a University of Massachusetts entomologist, has been characterized after her death as having made &quot;one of the most remarkable mistakes ever published in a scientific entomological journal&quot;, after publishing a 1951 account of what she called a mite infestation. Her detailed description of her own experience with mites was later shown to be incorrect, and has been described by others as a classic case of delusional parasitosis. Matan Shelomi says the paper has done &quot;permanent and lasting damage&quot; to people with delusional parasitosis, &quot;who widely circulate and cite articles such as Traver&#x27;s and other pseudoscientific or false reports&quot; via the internet, making treatment and cure more difficult. He argues that the historical paper should be retracted because it has misled people about their delusion and that papers &quot;written by or enabling deluded patients&quot;, along with internet-fed conspiracies and the related delusion of Morgellons, may increase.

Shelomi published another study in 2013 of what he called scientific misconduct when a 2004 article in the &quot;Journal of the New York Entomological Society&quot; included what he says is photo manipulation of a matchbox specimen to support the claim that individuals with DP are infested with collembola.

<text>The Belcea Quartet is a string quartet, formed in 1994, under the leadership of violinist Corina Belcea.

==History==
The quartet was formed while its members were studying at the Royal College of Music in London. Whilst there, they were coached by the Chilingirian Quartet. They subsequently studied with the Alban Berg Quartet at Cologne.

The quartet was one of the first groups to participate in the BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artists scheme, from 1999 to 2001. They made their Carnegie Hall debut in 2000 as part of the &#x27;Distinctive Debuts&#x27; series. Their first performance at the Edinburgh International Festival was in August 2001. The Belcea Quartet were quartet in-residence at Wigmore Hall in London from 2001 to 2006. During their Wigmore residency, the quartet participated in the first performances of &quot;The Canticle of the Rose&quot; by Joseph Phibbs.

In the 2010/11 season, the Belcea Quartet gave the world premiere of Mark Anthony Turnage&#x27;s new work for string quartet Twisted Blues with Twisted Ballad at Wigmore Hall, Cologne Philharmonie, Amsterdam Concertgebouw and the Vienna Konzerthaus. In May 2011, they curated their own &#x27;Beethoven &amp; Schubert: Final Years’ project with concerts in Aldeburgh, the Gulbenkian Grand Auditorium and Philharmonie Luxembourg, collaborating with Imogen Cooper, Ian Bostridge, Mark Padmore, Julius Drake and Valentin Erben. Towards the end of 2011, the Belcea Quartet embarked on an ambitious survey of the complete string quartets by Beethoven with cycles of concerts planned in the UK, Germany, Austria, Sweden and the USA.

The Belcea Quartet won the Gramophone Award for best debut recording in 2001. Their discography for EMI includes Fauré&#x27;s La Bonne Chanson with Ian Bostridge; Schubert&#x27;s Trout Quintet with Thomas Adès and Corin Long; a double disc of Britten&#x27;s string quartets, which won a MIDEM Cannes Award; Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Dissonance&quot; and &quot;Hoffmeister&quot; quartets; and the complete Bartók quartets, for which the Quartet was awarded the title Chamber Music Ensemble of the Year by Germany&#x27;s Echo Klassik Awards and nominated for a 2008 Gramophone Award. Their release of a double disc of the late Schubert Quartets and the String Quintet with Valentin Erben for EMI, was nominated for a Gramophone Award.

The Belcea Quartet are Quartet in Residence Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London, and, from the beginning of the 2010/11 season, Ensemble in Residence at the Vienna Konzerthaus.

<text>Carbonated water is water containing dissolved carbon dioxide gas, either artificially injected under pressure, or occurring due to natural geological processes. Carbonation causes small bubbles to form, giving the water an effervescent quality. Common forms include sparkling natural mineral water, club soda, and commercially produced sparkling water.

Club soda and sparkling mineral water and some other sparkling waters contain added or dissolved minerals such as potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or potassium sulfate. These occur naturally in some mineral waters but are also commonly added artificially to manufactured waters to mimic a natural flavor profile and offset the acidity of introducing carbon dioxide gas giving one a fizzy sensation. Various carbonated waters are sold in bottles and cans, with some also produced on demand by commercial carbonation systems in bars and restaurants, or made at home using a carbon dioxide cartridge.

It is thought that the first person to aerate water with carbon dioxide was William Brownrigg in the 1740s. Joseph Priestley invented carbonated water, independently and by accident, in 1767 when he discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide after having suspended a bowl of water above a beer vat at a brewery in Leeds, Yorkshire. He wrote of the &quot;peculiar satisfaction&quot; he found in drinking it, and in 1772 he published a paper entitled &quot;Impregnating Water with Fixed Air&quot;. Priestley&#x27;s apparatus, almost identical to that used by Henry Cavendish five years earlier, which featured a bladder between the generator and the absorption tank to regulate the flow of carbon dioxide, was soon joined by a wide range of others. However, it was not until 1781 that companies specialized in producing artificial mineral water were established and began producing carbonated water on a large scale. The first factory was built by Thomas Henry of Manchester, England. Henry replaced the bladder in Priestley&#x27;s system with large bellows.

While Priestley&#x27;s discovery ultimately led to the creation of the soft drink industry—which began in 1783 when Johann Jacob Schweppe founded Schweppes to sell bottled soda water—he did not benefit financially from his invention. Priestley received scientific recognition when the Council of the Royal Society &quot;were moved to reward its discoverer with the Copley Medal&quot; at the anniversary meeting of the Royal Society on 30 November 1773.

==Composition==
Natural and manufactured carbonated waters may contain a small amount of sodium chloride, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium sulfate, or disodium phosphate, depending on the product. These occur naturally in mineral waters but are added artificially to commercially produced waters to mimic a natural flavor profile and offset the acidity of introducing carbon dioxide gas (which creates low 5–6 pH carbonic acid solution when dissolved in water).

Artesian wells in such places as Mihalkovo in the Bulgarian Rhodope Mountains, Medžitlija in North Macedonia, and most notably in Selters in the German Taunus mountains, produce naturally effervescent mineral waters.

== Health effects ==
By itself, carbonated water appears to have little to no impact on health.

Carbonated water, such as club soda or sparkling water, is defined in US law as a food of minimal nutritional value, even if minerals, vitamins, or artificial sweeteners have been added to it.

Carbonated water does not appear to have an effect on gastroesophageal reflux disease. There is tentative evidence that carbonated water may help with constipation among people who have had a stroke.

===Acid erosion===
While carbonated water is somewhat acidic, this acidity can be partially neutralized by saliva. A study found that sparkling mineral water is slightly more erosive to teeth than non-carbonated water but is about 1% as corrosive as soft drinks are.

== Chemistry and physical properties ==

Carbon dioxide gas dissolved in water creates a small amount of carbonic acid (H2CO3):

: (l) + (g) ⇌ (aq)

with the concentration of carbonic acid being about 0.17% that of .
The acid gives carbonated water a slightly tart flavor. Its pH level of between 5 and 6 is approximately in between apple juice and orange juice in acidity, but much less acidic than the acid in the stomach. A normal, healthy human body maintains pH equilibrium via acid–base homeostasis and will not be materially adversely affected by consumption of plain carbonated water. Carbon dioxide in the blood is expelled through the lungs. Alkaline salts, such as sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, or potassium citrate, will increase pH.

The amount of a gas that can be dissolved in water is described by Henry&#x27;s Law. The coefficient depends on the temperature. In the carbonization process, water is chilled, optimally to just above freezing, to maximize the amount of carbon dioxide that can be dissolved in it. Higher gas pressure and lower temperature cause more gas to dissolve in the liquid. When the temperature is raised or the pressure is reduced (as happens when a container of carbonated water is opened), carbon dioxide effervesces, thereby escaping from the solution.

The density of carbonated water is slightly greater than that of pure water. The volume of a quantity of carbonated water can be calculated by taking the volume of the water and adding 0.8 cubic centimetres for each gram of .

== History ==
Many alcoholic drinks, such as beer, champagne, cider, and spritzer, were naturally carbonated through the fermentation process. In 1662 Christopher Merret created &#x27;sparkling wine&#x27;. William Brownrigg was apparently the first to produce artificial carbonated water, in the early 1740s, by using carbon dioxide taken from mines. In 1750 the Frenchman Gabriel François Venel also produced artificial carbonated water, though he misunderstood the nature of the gas that caused the carbonation. In 1764, Irish chemist Dr. Macbride infused water with carbon dioxide as part of a series of experiments on fermentation and putrefaction. In 1766 Henry Cavendish devised an aerating apparatus that would inspire Joseph Priestley to carry out his own experiments with regard to carbonated waters. Cavendish was also aware of Brownrigg&#x27;s observations at this time and published a paper on his own experiments on a nearby source of mineral water at the beginning of January in the next year.

In 1767 Priestley discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide by pouring water back and forth above a beer vat at a local brewery in Leeds, England. The air blanketing the fermenting beer—called &#x27;fixed air&#x27;—was known to kill mice suspended in it. Priestley found water thus treated had a pleasant taste, and he offered it to friends as a cool, refreshing drink. In 1772, Priestley published a paper titled &quot;Impregnating Water with Fixed Air&quot; in which he describes dripping &quot;oil of vitriol&quot; (sulfuric acid) onto chalk to produce carbon dioxide gas, and encouraging the gas to dissolve into an agitated bowl of water. Priestley referred to his invention of this treated water as being his &quot;happiest&quot; discovery.
Priestley&#x27;s apparatus, which was very similar to that invented by Henry Cavendish five years earlier, featured a bladder between the generator and the absorption tank to regulate the flow of carbon dioxide, and was soon joined by a wide range of others, but it was not until 1781 that companies specialized in producing artificial mineral water were established and began producing carbonated water on a large scale. The first factory was built by Thomas Henry of Manchester, England. Henry replaced the bladder in Priestley&#x27;s system with large bellows. J. J. Schweppe developed a process to manufacture bottled carbonated mineral water based on the discovery of Priestley, founding the Schweppes Company in Geneva in 1783. Schweppes regarded Priestley as &quot;the father of our industry&quot;. In 1792, Schweppe moved to London to develop the business there. In 1799 Augustine Thwaites founded Thwaites&#x27; Soda Water in Dublin. A &quot;London Globe&quot; article claims that this company was the first to patent and sell &quot;Soda Water&quot; under that name. The article says that in the hot summer of 1777 in London &quot;aerated waters&quot; (that is, carbonated) were selling well but there was as yet no mention of &quot;soda water&quot;, though the first effervescent drinks were probably made using &quot;soda powders&quot; containing bicarbonate of soda and tartaric acid. The name soda water arose from the fact that soda (sodium carbonate or bicarbonate) was often added to adjust the taste and pH.

Modern carbonated water is made by injecting pressurized carbon dioxide into water. The pressure increases the solubility and allows more carbon dioxide to dissolve than would be possible under standard atmospheric pressure. When the bottle is opened, the pressure is released, allowing gas to exit the solution, forming the characteristic bubbles.

Modern sources of CO2 are from industrial processes, such as burning of fossil fuels like coal and methane at power plants, or steam reforming of methane for hydrogen production.

=== Etymology ===
In the United States, plain carbonated water was generally known either as &quot;soda water&quot;, due to the sodium salts it contained, or &quot;seltzer water&quot;, deriving from the German town Selters renowned for its mineral springs.

Sodium salts were added to plain water both as flavoring (to mimic famed mineral waters, such as naturally effervescent &quot;Selters&quot;, &quot;Vichy water&quot; and &quot;Saratoga Water&quot;) and acidity regulators (to offset the acidic 5-6 pH carbonic acid created when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water).

In the 1950s the term club soda began to be popularized.

Generally, &quot;seltzer water&quot; has no added sodium salts, while &quot;club soda&quot; still retains some sodium salts.

== Products for carbonating water ==

=== Home ===
==== Soda siphons ====

The soda siphon, or seltzer bottle—a glass or metal pressure vessel with a release valve and spout for dispensing pressurized soda water—was a common sight in bars and in early- to mid-20th-century homes where it became a symbol of middle-class affluence.

The gas pressure in a siphon drives soda water up through a tube inside the siphon when a valve lever at the top is depressed. Commercial soda siphons came pre-charged with water and gas and were returned to the retailer for exchange when empty. A deposit scheme ensured they were not otherwise thrown away.

Home soda siphons can carbonate flatwater through the use of a small disposable steel bulb containing carbon dioxide. The bulb is pressed into the valve assembly at the top of the siphon, the gas injected, then the bulb withdrawn.

==== Gasogene ====

The gasogene (or gazogene, or seltzogene) is a late Victorian device for producing carbonated water. It consists of two linked glass globes: the lower contained water or other drink to be made sparkling, the upper a mixture of tartaric acid and sodium bicarbonate that reacts to produce carbon dioxide. The produced gas pushes the liquid in the lower container up a tube and out of the device. The globes are surrounded by a wicker or wire protective mesh, as they have a tendency to explode.

==== Codd-neck bottles ====

In 1872, soft drink maker Hiram Codd of Camberwell, London, designed and patented the Codd-neck bottle, designed specifically for carbonated drinks. The &quot;Codd-neck bottle&quot; encloses a marble and a rubber washer/gasket in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer, sealing in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.

Soon after its introduction, the bottle became extremely popular with the soft drink and brewing industries mainly in the UK and the rest of Europe, Asia, and Australasia, though some alcohol drinkers disdained the use of the bottle. R. White&#x27;s, the biggest soft drinks company in London and south-east England when the bottle was introduced, was among the companies that sold their drinks in Codd&#x27;s glass bottles. One etymology of the term &quot;&quot; originates from beer sold in Codd bottles, though this is generally dismissed as a folk etymology.

The bottles were produced for many decades, but gradually declined in usage. Since children smashed the bottles to retrieve the marbles, vintage bottles are relatively rare and have become collector items, particularly in the UK. Due to the risk of explosion and injuries from fragmented glass pieces, use of this type of bottle is discouraged in most countries, since other methods of sealing pressurized bottles can more easily incorporate release of unsafe pressures. The Codd-neck design is still used for the Japanese soft drink Ramune, and in the Indian drink called Banta.

==== Soda makers ====
Soda makers or soda carbonators are appliances that carbonate water with multiple-use carbon dioxide canisters. A variety of systems are produced by manufacturers and hobbyists. The commercial units may be sold with concentrated syrup for making flavored soft drinks.

One major producer of soda carbonators is SodaStream. Their products were popular during the 1970s and 1980s in the United Kingdom, and are associated with nostalgia for that period and have experienced a comeback in the 2000s.

=== Commercial ===
The process of dissolving carbon dioxide in water is called carbonation. Commercial soda water in siphons is made by chilling filtered plain water to or below, optionally adding a sodium or potassium based alkaline compound such as sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the acid created when pressurizing the water with carbon dioxide (which creates high 8-10 pH carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer solution when dissolved in water). The gas dissolves in the water, and a top-off fill of carbon dioxide is added to pressurize the siphon to approximately , some higher than is present in fermenting champagne bottles.

In many modern restaurants and bars soda water is manufactured on-site using devices known as carbonators. Carbonators use mechanical pumps to pump water into a pressurized chamber where it is combined with carbon dioxide from pressurized tanks at approximately . The pressurized carbonated water then flows either directly to taps or mixing heads where flavoring is added before dispensing.

==Uses==
===Carbonated beverages===
Carbonated water is a key ingredient in soft drinks, beverages that typically consist of carbonated water, a sweetener, and a flavoring such as cola, ginger, or citrus.

Plain carbonated water or sparkling mineral water is often consumed as an alternative to soft drinks. Club soda is carbonated water to which compounds such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium sulfate have been added. Many manufacturers produce unsweetened sparkling water products that are lightly flavored by the addition of aromatic ingredients such as essential oils. Carbonated water is often mixed with fruit juice to make sparkling alcoholic and non-alcoholic punches.

===Alcoholic beverages===
Carbonated water is a diluent mixed with alcoholic beverages where it is used to top-off the drink and provides a degree of &#x27;fizz&#x27;.

Adding soda water to &quot;short&quot; drinks such as spirits dilutes them and makes them &quot;long&quot; (not to be confused with long drinks such as those made with vermouth). Carbonated water also works well in short drinks made with whiskey, brandy, and Campari. Soda water may be used to dilute drinks based on cordials such as orange squash. Soda water is a necessary ingredient in many cocktails, such as whiskey and soda or Campari and soda.

===Cooking===
Carbonated water is increasingly popular in Western cooking as a substitute for plain water in deep-frying batters to provide a lighter texture to doughs similar to &quot;tempura&quot;. Kevin Ryan, a food scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, says the effervescent bubbles when mixed with dough provide a light tempura-like texture, which gives the illusion of being lower calorie than regular frying batters. The lightness is caused by pockets of carbon dioxide gas being introduced into the batter (a process which natural rising using yeast also creates) and further expanding when cooked.

=== Stain remover ===
Since the dissolved gas in carbonated water acts as a temporary surfactant, it has been recommended as a household remedy for removing stains, particularly those of red wine.

<doc id="240562" wikidata="Q2164722" url="?curid=240562" title="United Pentecostal Church International">
<text>The United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) is a Oneness Pentecostal denomination headquartered in Weldon Spring, Missouri. The United Pentecostal Church International was formed in 1945 by a merger of the former Pentecostal Church, Inc. and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. 

The United Pentecostal Church International began with 521 churches and has grown to more than 45,000 churches, including daughter works and preaching points, 45,000 ministers, and a total constituency of over 5.8 million worldwide, making it the largest Oneness denomination. The international fellowship of United Pentecostals consists of national organizations that are united as the Global Council of the UPCI, which is chaired by the general superintendent of the UPCI, currently David K. Bernard.

==History==
The United Pentecostal Church International emerged from the Pentecostal movement, which traces its origins to the teachings of Charles Parham in Topeka, Kansas, and the Azusa Street Revival led by William J. Seymour in 1906. The UPCI traces its organizational roots to 1916, when a large group of Pentecostal ministers within the Assemblies of God USA began to unite around the teaching of the oneness of God and water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Several Oneness ministers met in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, and on January 2, 1917, formed a Oneness Pentecostal organization called the General Assembly of the Apostolic Assemblies.

The General Assembly of the Apostolic Assemblies merged with another church, the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World (PAW), and accepted the leadership of G. T. Haywood, an African American. This group held the first meeting in Eureka Springs in 1918. This interracial organization adopted the PAW name and remained the only Oneness Pentecostal body until late 1924. Southern Jim Crow laws and racial hatred resulted in many white leaders withdrawing from the PAW rather than remaining under African American leadership. Many local congregations in the Southern U.S., however, remained integrated while attempting to comply with local segregation laws.

In 1925, three new Oneness churches were formed: the Apostolic Churches of Jesus Christ, the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance, and Emmanuel&#x27;s Church in Jesus Christ. In 1927, steps were taken toward reunifying these organizations. Meeting in a joint convention in Guthrie, Oklahoma, Emmanuel&#x27;s Church in Jesus Christ and the Apostolic Churches of Jesus Christ merged, taking the name the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ. This merger united about 400 Oneness Pentecostal ministers. In 1931, a unity conference with representatives from four Oneness organizations met in Columbus, Ohio attempting to bring all Oneness Pentecostals together. The Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance voted to merge with the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ, but the terms of the proposed merger were rejected by that body. Nevertheless, a union between the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ and the PAW was consummated in November 1931. The new body retained the name of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World.

In 1932, the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance changed its name to the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated to reflect its organizational structure. In 1936, Pentecostal Church, Incorporated ministers voted to work toward an amalgamation with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. Final union, however, proved elusive until September 25, 1945, when these two Oneness Pentecostal organizations voted in St. Louis, MO, to merge and form the United Pentecostal Church International. The merger of these two Oneness Pentecostal bodies brought together 521 churches.

In the U.S. and Canada, the newly formed United Pentecostal Church International traditionally reflected the surrounding demographics, with the majority of its constituency being White and Anglo-American. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, however, the United Pentecostal Church International attempted to shift its doctrines toward the inclusion of every race and culture in North America. In 2008, the United Pentecostal Church International published a statement against racism, stating that it affirms the worth and dignity of every human being, regardless of race or ethnicity, and consequently opposes bigotry and hatred. Despite attempts to reconcile with minorities, several congregations have left the United Pentecostal Church International citing persistent racism.

==Beliefs==
===Essential doctrines===

The UPCI&#x27;s core theology is consistent with that of other Oneness Pentecostals, rejecting the Trinity and instead believing that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are different manifestations of God, as opposed to separate persons. The UPCI believes that one must repent, be baptized &quot;in the name of Jesus&quot; (as opposed to &quot;in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit&quot;), and receive the Holy Ghost with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues to be saved, as outlined in Acts 2:38.

===Sexuality===

Ministers at all levels of the UPCI are allowed to marry and have children. The UPCI considers any form of homosexuality, fornication, adultery, polygamy, bestiality, incest, and transgenderism to be contrary to biblical teaching and states that God&#x27;s plan is &quot;heterosexuality, with definite boundaries between sexes in both appearance and behavior.&quot; The UPCI has stated, however, that it does not preach condemnation, but rather reconciliation, and implores everyone to be reconciled to God.

===Abortion===

The UPCI opposes legalized abortion, as well as any legislation that would &quot;bring about a climate designed to undermine the sanctity of human life.&quot; It has also designated the third Sunday in January of each year as &quot;Sanctity of Life Sunday.&quot;

===Technology===

The UPCI states in its Articles of Faith that it disapproves of members owning televisions.

In 1998, the UPCI published a position paper on computer and internet usage that suggested the following guidelines in the home:
*Placing computers in an area used by the whole family
*Placing programs on computers that block vulgar or sexually explicit material
*Sharing passwords
*Regularly evaluating website history
*Exercising restraint in the usage of such devices

In a 2013 position paper, the UPCI further clarified its stance on all forms of media technology outside of television, including computers, tablets, smartphones, and gaming consoles. It stated that because &quot;sinful media programming&quot; is available through such mediums, the UPCI calls for responsible use that is solely in accordance with &quot;wholesome Christian principles.&quot;

===Other issues===
The UPCI lays out its position on other matters in its ministerial manual, including the following issues.
====Gambling====

The UPCI is opposed to gambling, defined as “to bet on an uncertain outcome, to stake something on a contingency, playing the game of chance for stakes.” This opposition is due to the fact that it considers gambling addictive, inconsistent with scriptural work ethic, ignoring stewardship, and involving monetary gain to the hurt and suffering of the less fortunate.
====Organized sports====
The UPCI recommends that members refrain from participating in organized sports―excluding recreational activities within the local church―because it has an &quot;attitude and appearance that opposes Pentecostal principles, teachings, and standards.&quot;

====Transcendental Meditation====
The UPCI is strongly opposed to Transcendental Meditation and its &quot;further funding, promotion, or teaching... in classrooms.&quot;

====Bible translations====

In response to the publication of the Revised Standard Version in 1952, the UPCI&#x27;s General Conference adopted a statement in 1953 disapproving the use of the translation. Further, the statement provided the King James Version as &quot;the most accurate translation of the Scriptures to be used in our churches and among our people.&quot;

In 2022, the UPCI further clarified its stance on Bible translations with a position paper. The statement continued to recognize the King James Version of the Bible as a &quot;trusted and prominent translation of the Scriptures,&quot; and further recommended only translations (in English or other languages) that meet the following guidelines:
*Developed by a committee of scholars who hold a high view of inspiration―considering Scripture both inspired and infallible
*Relatively literal in translation

==Organization==
The basic governmental structure of the UPCI is congregational at the local church level and presbyterian at higher organizational levels. Local churches are self-governing, electing their own pastors and other leaders, owning their own property, deciding their own budgets, establishing their membership, and conducting all necessary local business. The central organization embraces a modified presbyterian system: ministers meet in sectional, district, and general conferences to elect officers and to conduct the church&#x27;s affairs. The annual General Conference is the highest authority in the UPCI, with the power to determine articles of faith, elect officers, and determine policy. A General Superintendent is elected to preside over the church as a whole. On October 1, 2009, David K. Bernard was announced as the current General Superintendent.

===Statistics===
The UPCI grew from 521 member churches in 1945 to 5,081 churches (including 489 daughter works and 333 preaching points), 12,018 ministers, and a total constituency of 1,091,000 in the United States and Canada in 2024. The UPCI has also experienced substantial growth over the last 10 years in the United States and Canada, adding 588 churches and 2,413 ministers between 2014 and 2024. Outside the U.S. and Canada, the UPCI has 40,440 churches and preaching points, 33,862 ministers, and a constituency of 4,785,291 in 218 nations and 11 territories. The international fellowship consists of national organizations that are united as the Global Council of the UPCI, which is chaired by the general superintendent of the UPCI, David K. Bernard. Total worldwide membership, including North America, is at 5.87 million.

===General Conference===
The General Conference of the United Pentecostal Church International is an annual conference occurring yearly since 1945. It is the highest governing body of the UPCI. Attendees of the conference conduct business, receive training, network with colleagues, participate in worship sessions, and raise funds for various ministries.

===North American Youth Congress===

North American Youth Congress (NAYC) is a church gathering primarily for the youth of the UPCI, held biennially since 1979 in various locations around North America. NAYC is the largest event hosted by the United Pentecostal Church International and has been described as one of the largest, if not the largest, gathering of Christian youth in the US. The largest NAYC to date was in 2019, when NAYC was held at The Dome at America&#x27;s Center in St. Louis, Missouri from July 31 to August 2. The event was attended by over 36,000 youths.

==Educational institutions==
The UPCI owns and operates one accredited seminary, Urshan Graduate School of Theology in Wentzville, Missouri. It was accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in 2010, and also by the Higher Learning Commission on June 25, 2020. The UPCI also operates one Christian liberal arts college accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, Urshan University (formerly Urshan College and Gateway College of Evangelism) in Wentzville, Missouri. The college was established in October 2011, when the UPCI General Board approved a plan for Urshan Graduate School of Theology to acquire Gateway College (a college formerly run by the UPCI&#x27;s Missouri District) to establish Urshan University as a new Christian liberal arts college. The transition was completed on July 1, 2012.

In addition, the UPCI endorses several other Christian and Bible colleges. The only endorsed accredited institution not owned by the UPCI is Christian Life College in Stockton, California, which has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) since 2019. Other unaccredited bible colleges endorsed by the UPCI are:
*Apostolic Bible Institute in St. Paul, Minnesota
*Centro Teológico Ministerial in Pasadena, Texas
*Indiana Bible College in Indianapolis, Indiana
*Northeast Christian College in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada
*North Texas Christian College in Euless, Texas
*Texas Bible College in Lufkin, Texas

Currently, there are only three accredited colleges and seminaries endorsed by the UPCI:
*Christian Life College in Stockton, California
*Urshan University in Wentzville, Missouri
*Urshan Graduate School of Theology in Wentzville, Missouri

===Global Association of Theological Studies===
The Global Association of Theological Studies (or GATS) is the higher education arm of UPCI Global Missions, overseeing the development and implementation of Oneness Pentecostal curriculum for its member schools. The GATS has 526 bible schools in 120 countries worldwide, representing about 11,000 students and 3,000 graduates annually. In 2019, its member schools graduated 3,375 students.

<doc id="240565" wikidata="Q1818410" url="?curid=240565" title="Battle of Maserfield">
<text>The Battle of Maserfield, () was fought on 5 August 641 or 642 (642 according to Ward) between the Anglo-Saxon kings Oswald of Northumbria and Penda of Mercia allied with Welsh Kingdom of Gwynedd, ending in Oswald&#x27;s defeat, death, and dismemberment. The location was also known as &quot;Cogwy&quot; in Welsh, with Welshmen from Pengwern participating in the battle (according to the probably ninth-century &quot;Canu Heledd&quot;), probably as allies of the Mercians. Bede reports the commonly accepted date given above; the Welsh &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; is generally considered incorrect in giving the year of the battle as 644. The site of the battle is traditionally identified with Oswestry. 

==Background==
&quot;Since the death of Oswald&#x27;s uncle Edwin of Northumbria at Hatfield Chase in 633, the Mercians under Penda had presented an obstacle to the power of Northumbria over the lands of Britain south of the Humber. Oswald had defeated Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd, King of the Britons (Penda&#x27;s ally at Hatfield) at Heavenfield in 634, and subsequently re-established Northumbrian hegemony across much of Britain; although it is thought that Penda recognized Oswald&#x27;s authority in some form after Heavenfield, he may nevertheless have been hostile to Northumbrian power or at least perceived by Oswald as a threat.&quot;

==Location and place-names==
The Battle of Maserfield was assumed for much of the twentieth century to have taken place at what is now Oswestry in Shropshire. The etymology of this name is &quot;Oswald&#x27;s Tree&quot;, while the traditional Welsh name for the same place is &quot;Croesoswald&quot; (&quot;Oswald&#x27;s Cross&quot;); although an association with King Oswald of Northumbria is not certain, the name is popularly assumed to refer to him. In the mid -seventh century, Oswestry is thought to have probably still been in the territory of Powys. If this location is correct, it would mean Oswald was in the territory of his enemies, which would suggest he was on the offensive. 

However, neither the Welsh nor English names for the battle site have been securely identified with modern reflexes or localised, and site of the battle is still debated among scholars; in 2020, Andrew Breeze suggested Forden in Powys, particularly on the basis of place-names that seem to be associated with the battle in the Welsh &quot;Canu Heledd&quot;.

The site of the battle is named &quot;Maserfelth&quot; (with the variant spelling &quot;Maserfeld&quot;) in the principal source for the battle, Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;. The second element of this name is the Old English word that became &quot;field&quot; in present-day English. The first element is debated: it has been taken as a possibly unique Old English attestation of the word &quot;mazer&quot;; a word having something to do with Welsh &quot;maes&quot; (&#x27;field&#x27;); or to be the Welsh female name &quot;Meiser&quot; (an argument supported by the place-name &quot;Dyffryn Meiser&quot; in &quot;Canu Heledd&quot;).

The &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; record a battle for 644 at a site which they call by the Old Welsh name &quot;Cocboy&quot;; the same name is found in a later form as &quot;Cogwy&quot; in &quot;Canu Heledd&quot;; and the battle described in these Welsh texts is agreed to be identical with the Battle of Maserfield known from Bede (albeit that &quot;Canu Heledd&quot;&#x27;s account may owe little to historical reality). Andrew Breeze has etymologised this name as a compound of the Brittonic word *&quot;kok&quot;- (&#x27;rock&#x27;) and a personal name *&quot;Boia&quot;, thus meaning &#x27;hill of Boia&#x27;.

==Outbreak of war==
The cause of the war that led to Maserfield is unknown. The historian Bede, writing in the next century, portrayed Oswald as a saintly figure in his &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;; his desire to portray Oswald in a positive light may have led him to omit mention of Oswald&#x27;s aggressive warfare. He says only that Oswald died fighting for his country at Maserfield, giving the impression that the battle was part of a &quot;just war&quot;.

Penda&#x27;s Welsh allies may have included Cynddylan ap Cyndrwyn of Powys: the &quot;awdl&quot;-poem &quot;Marwnad Cynddylan&quot;, thought to have been composed shortly after his death, says of him that &quot;when the son of Pyd requested, how ready he was&quot;. This may be a reference to Penda, the son of Pybba, meaning that Cynddylan was eager to fight in battle alongside him. 

==Battle==
The outcome of the battle was defeat for the Northumbrians. Bede mentions the story that Oswald prayed for the souls of his soldiers when he saw that he was about to die. Oswald&#x27;s body was cut into pieces, and his head and arms mounted on poles; the parts were retrieved in the next year by his brother and successor Oswiu. Since Penda was a pagan and Oswald was Christian, the latter was subsequently venerated as a martyr and saint. Bede reports a number of miracles attributed to Oswald&#x27;s bones and to the spot where he died. (In the 12th century, Henry of Huntingdon wrote of the battle: &quot;It is said the plain of Maserfeld was white with the bones of the Saints&quot;.) The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; accredits Penda&#x27;s victory to &quot;diabolical agency&quot;, but the characterization of the battle as a clash between Christians and pagans may be oversimplified if there were Welsh, who were Christian, fighting on Penda&#x27;s side. The 20th-century historian, D. P. Kirby, wrote that the battle left Penda as &quot;without question the most powerful Mercian ruler so far to have emerged in the midlands&quot;.

According to the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, Penda&#x27;s brother Eowa, also said to have been a king of the Mercians, was killed in the battle along with Oswald. The possibility exists that he was subject to Oswald and fighting in the battle as his ally. It has been suggested that Eowa was the dominant king among the Mercians for a period prior to the battle, and it has also been suggested that he had ruled the northern Mercians while Penda ruled the southern Mercians. Since the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; says Penda ruled for only ten years (Bede says 22 years: 633–655), this may mean that it was dating Penda&#x27;s reign from the time of his victory at Maserfield; this would make sense if Eowa&#x27;s death removed an important rival to Penda, enabling him to claim or consolidate authority over all the Mercians.

==Aftermath==
Following the battle, Deira, in the southern part of Northumbria, chose a king of its own, Oswine, while Bernicia in the north (which had been dominant, with Oswald, a member of the Bernician royal line, ruling both Bernicia and Deira prior to Maserfield) was ruled by Oswald&#x27;s brother Oswiu. Thus the battle led to the internal weakening and fracturing of the Northumbrian kingdom, a situation which lasted until after the Battle of the Winwaed, despite Oswine&#x27;s murder on the orders of Oswiu in 651.

According to Frank Stenton, Maserfield left Penda as &quot;the most formidable king in England&quot;. He maintained this position until his death in battle against the Bernicians at the Battle of Winwaed in 655; at times in the years between the two battles, his power was sufficient that he could mount destructive raids into Bernicia itself, at one point besieging Bamburgh, prior to his final, doomed campaign.

<doc id="240568" wikidata="Q899599" url="?curid=240568" title="Stress–strain curve">
<text>In engineering and materials science, a stress–strain curve for a material gives the relationship between stress and strain. It is obtained by gradually applying load to a test coupon and measuring the deformation, from which the stress and strain can be determined (see tensile testing). These curves reveal many of the properties of a material, such as the Young&#x27;s modulus, the yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength.

== Definition == 
Generally speaking, curves that represent the relationship between stress and strain in any form of deformation can be regarded as stress–strain curves. The stress and strain can be normal, shear, or a mixture, and can also be uniaxial, biaxial, or multiaxial, and can even change with time. The form of deformation can be compression, stretching, torsion, rotation, and so on. If not mentioned otherwise, stress–strain curve typically refers to the relationship between axial normal stress and axial normal strain of materials measured in a tension test.

== Stages ==
A schematic diagram for the stress–strain curve of low carbon steel at room temperature is shown in figure 1. There are several stages showing different behaviors, which suggests different mechanical properties. To clarify, materials can miss one or more stages shown in figure 1, or have totally different stages.

=== Linear elastic region ===
The first stage is the linear elastic region. The stress is proportional to the strain, that is, obeys the general Hooke&#x27;s law, and the slope is Young&#x27;s modulus. In this region, the material undergoes only elastic deformation. The end of the stage is the initiation point of plastic deformation. The stress component of this point is defined as yield strength (or upper yield point, UYP for short).

=== Strain hardening region ===
The second stage is the strain hardening region. This region starts as the stress goes beyond the yielding point, reaching a maximum at the ultimate strength point, which is the maximal stress that can be sustained and is called the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). In this region, the stress mainly increases as the material elongates, except that for some materials such as steel, there is a nearly flat region at the beginning. The stress of the flat region is defined as the lower yield point (LYP) and results from the formation and propagation of Lüders bands. Explicitly, heterogeneous plastic deformation forms bands at the upper yield strength and these bands carrying with deformation spread along the sample at the lower yield strength. After the sample is again uniformly deformed, the increase of stress with the progress of extension results from work strengthening, that is, dense dislocations induced by plastic deformation hampers the further motion of dislocations. To overcome these obstacles, a higher resolved shear stress should be applied. As the strain accumulates, work strengthening gets reinforced, until the stress reaches the ultimate tensile strength.

=== Necking region ===
The third stage is the necking region. Beyond tensile strength, a necking forms where the local cross-sectional area becomes significantly smaller than the average. The necking deformation is heterogeneous and will reinforce itself as the stress concentrates more at the reduced section. Such positive feedback leads to quick development of necking and leads to fracture. Note that though the pulling force is decreasing, the work strengthening is still progressing, that is, the true stress keeps growing but the engineering stress decreases because the shrinking section area is not considered. This region ends up with the fracture. After fracture, percent elongation and reduction in section area can be calculated.

== Classification ==

Some common characteristics among the stress–strain curves can be distinguished with various groups of materials and, on this basis, to divide materials into two broad categories; namely, the ductile materials and the brittle materials.

=== Ductile materials ===
Ductile materials, including structural steel and many other metals, are characterized by their ability to yield at normal temperatures. For example, low-carbon steel generally exhibits a very linear stress–strain relationship up to a well-defined yield point. The linear portion of the curve is the elastic region, and the slope of this region is the modulus of elasticity or Young&#x27;s modulus. Plastic flow initiates at the upper yield point and continues at the lower yield point.

The appearance of the upper yield point is associated with the pinning of dislocations in the system. Permanent deformation occurs once dislocations are forced to move past pinning points. Initially, this permanent deformation is non-uniformly distributed along the sample. During this process, dislocations escape from Cottrell atmospheres within the material. The resulting slip bands appear at the lower yield point and propagate along the gauge length, at constant stress, until the Lüders strain is reached, and deformation becomes uniform.

Beyond the Lüders strain, the stress increases due to strain hardening until it reaches the ultimate tensile stress. During this stage, the cross-sectional area decreases uniformly along the gauge length, due to the incompressibility of plastic flow (not because of the Poisson effect, which is an elastic phenomenon). Then a process of necking begins, which ends in a &#x27;cup and cone&#x27; fracture characteristic of ductile materials.

The appearance of necking in ductile materials is associated with geometrical instability in the system. Due to the natural inhomogeneity of the material, it is common to find some regions with small inclusions or porosity, within the material or on its surface, where strain will concentrate, leading to a local reduction in cross-sectional area. For strain less than the ultimate tensile strain, the increase of work-hardening rate in this region will be greater than the area reduction rate, thereby make this region harder to deform than others, so that the instability will be removed, i.e. the material increases in homogeneity before reaching the ultimate strain. However, beyond this, the work hardening rate will decrease, such that a region with smaller area is weaker than nearby regions, therefore reduction in area will concentrate in this region and the neck will become more and more pronounced until fracture. After the neck has formed in the material, further plastic deformation is concentrated in the neck while the remainder of the material undergoes elastic contraction owing to the decrease in tensile force.

The stress–strain curve for a ductile material can be approximated using the Ramberg–Osgood equation. This equation is straightforward to implement, and only requires the material&#x27;s yield strength, ultimate strength, elastic modulus, and percent elongation.

==== Toughness ====

Materials that are both strong and ductile are classified as &quot;tough&quot;. Toughness is a material property defined as the area under the stress-strain curve.

Toughness can be determined by integrating the stress-strain curve. It is the energy of mechanical deformation per unit volume prior to fracture. The explicit mathematical description is:formula_1where
* formula_2 is strain
* formula_3 is the strain upon failure
* formula_4 is stress

=== Brittle materials ===
Brittle materials, which include cast iron, glass, and stone, are characterized by the fact that rupture occurs without any noticeable prior change in the rate of elongation, sometimes they fracture before yielding.

Brittle materials such as concrete or carbon fiber do not have a well-defined yield point, and do not strain-harden. Therefore, the ultimate strength and breaking strength are the same. Typical brittle materials like glass do not show any plastic deformation but fail while the deformation is elastic. One of the characteristics of a brittle failure is that the two broken parts can be reassembled to produce the same shape as the original component as there will not be a neck formation like in the case of ductile materials. A typical stress–strain curve for a brittle material will be linear. For some materials, such as concrete, tensile strength is negligible compared to the compressive strength and it is assumed to be zero for many engineering applications. Glass fibers have a tensile strength greater than that of steel, but bulk glass usually does not. This is because of the stress intensity factor associated with defects in the material. As the size of the sample gets larger, the expected size of the largest defect also grows.

<text>The Taunton Stop Line was a World War II defensive line in southwest England. It was designed &quot;to stop an enemy&#x27;s advance from the west and in particular a rapid advance supported by armoured fighting vehicles (up to the size of a German medium tank) which may have broken through the forward defences.&quot;

==History==
The Taunton Stop Line was one of more than fifty similar defensive lines that were constructed around England in WWII, all designed to compartmentalise the country to contain any breakthrough until reinforcements could arrive. Stop Lines used a combination of geography and construction to make continuous defences. The innermost and longest was the GHQ Line. They were constructed as part of a package of field fortifications planned under the leadership of General Sir Edmund Ironside, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces.

The Taunton Stop Line ran north–south for nearly through Somerset, Dorset and Devon, from Seaton to Axminster to Chard along the River Axe, then along the Great Western Railway to Ilminster, the railway and Chard Canal to Taunton, the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal to Bridgwater, and the River Parrett to the coast near Highbridge. Highbridge was also the starting point for the east–west GHQ Line.

Aside from the obstacles created by canals, rivers and railway embankments, by early 1942 the line was defended by 309 light machine gun pillboxes (typically for the Bren gun), 61 medium machine gun emplacements (typically for the Vickers machine gun), 21 static anti-tank gun emplacements (equipped with ex-World War I naval six-pound guns), along with numerous anti-tank obstacles in the form of concrete posts, cubes and pyramids, while charge chambers were cut into bridges ready for demolition. Other armaments used included Boys Anti-tank Rifle and mobile QF 2 pounder guns.

To reinforce the line and deny access to the major east–west routes that passed through the line, in 1941 twelve &quot;Defensive Islands&quot; were added to the line under a plan devised by General Brooke, who succeeded General Sir Edmund Ironside. These included Bridgwater and Creech St Michael.

Two divisions from GHQ Home Forces Reserve were originally assigned to man the line, although from the autumn of 1940 the Home Guard were increasingly used.

Many pillboxes can still be seen along the length of the line.

<text>James Maxton (22 June 1885 – 23 July 1946) was a Scottish left-wing politician, and leader of the Independent Labour Party. He was a pacifist who opposed both world wars. A prominent proponent of Home Rule for Scotland, he is remembered as one of the leading figures of the Red Clydeside era. He broke with Ramsay MacDonald and the second minority Labour government, and became one of its most bitter critics. As the leader of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), he disaffiliated the ILP from the mainstream party in 1932. Afterwards, he became an independent dissident outside front-line politics.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Born in then burgh of Pollokshaws (now part of the city of Glasgow) in 1885, James Maxton was the son of two schoolteachers. He would himself later enter that profession after his education at Hutchesons&#x27; Boys&#x27; Grammar School and the University of Glasgow.

Whilst studying at the University of Glasgow, Maxton had described his political loyalties as lying with the Conservatives. He soon came to socialism, however, and in 1904 he joined the Barrhead branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Maxton&#x27;s move to socialism was heavily influenced by John Maclean, a fellow student at Glasgow University. In addition to Maclean&#x27;s influence, Maxton was moved towards socialism by a meeting which he attended in Paisley which was addressed by party leader Philip Snowden. He was also influenced by the written word, including books by Robert Blatchford and Peter Kropotkin.

Later in life, Maxton claimed that the biggest influence in his decision to become a socialist was the grinding poverty experienced by many of the children he taught. He subsequently convinced all his siblings to join the ILP, with his sister Annie becoming a prominent figure in the organisation.

From 1906 to 1910, Maxton was active in the Schoolmasters&#x27; Union, where he refined his talents as a propagandist and orator.

===Personal life===
On 24 July 1919, Maxton married teacher Sarah McCallum. They had one child, James, in 1921. Sarah died in 1922. On 14 March 1935, Maxton married Madeline Grace Glasier, who had worked for him as a volunteer researcher and secretary for 11 years. 

===Political career===

Maxton was known as an effective public speaker. Historian Keith Middlemas offers this vivid description:

He was well-known as a platform orator with a thin hatchet face and mane of long black hair which fell across his face giving it a saturnine and piratical appearance, but although he was an established speaker and propagandist for the ILP, his considerable intellect had been somewhat masked by the showman&#x27;s facility. The genuine hero-worship which grew around him was restricted to his native Barrhead where the ILP branch was his private preserve.

Maxton was a vociferous opponent of World War I. He was a conscientious objector, refusing conscription into the British Armed Forces, and instead being given work on barges. During this time he was involved in organizing strikes in the shipyards as part of the Clyde Workers&#x27; Committee. Maxton was arrested in 1916, and charged with sedition. He was subsequently found guilty and imprisoned for a year.

In 1918, Maxton was elected to the National Council of the Labour Party. He and Ramsay MacDonald were responsible for moving the motion at the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party which dictated that Labour members of David Lloyd George&#x27;s wartime coalition government resign from it in preparation for the 1918 general election. He was also a keen supporter of Scottish Home Rule and was for a while the President of the Scottish Home Rule Association when Ramsay MacDonald was the Secretary of the London Branch.

Maxton stood for parliament in the 1918 general election as a Labour Party candidate but was defeated in this first effort.

In his next electoral attempt, Maxton was successful, winning a seat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Bridgeton in the 1922 general election. Once in parliament, however, Maxton&#x27;s forthright views often caused controversy. In 1923, his parliamentary privileges were temporarily removed when he called the Conservative MP Sir Frederick Banbury a &quot;murderer&quot;, following the government&#x27;s decision to withdraw school milk. In 1933, when then-Prime Minister MacDonald made a particularly meandering and incoherent speech to Parliament, it was interrupted by Maxton calling out: &quot;Sit down, man, you&#x27;re a bloody tragedy.&quot;

Maxton was chairman of the ILP from 1926 to 1931, and from 1934 to 1939; he was generally seen as the symbol of the ILP after its break from Labour in 1932. A militant socialist, he was horrified by the perceived class collaborationism of the Trades Union Congress after the defeat of the 1926 General Strike, and was co-author with the left-wing Miners leader, Arthur Cook, of the &quot;Cook-Maxton Manifesto&quot; of 1928 calling for class warfare in the overthrow of capitalism. As chairman of the ILP, he endorsed a &quot;Living Wages&quot; policy demanding high minimum wages for workers and nationalization of all private businesses unable to pay them.

In 1927, Maxton was elected International Chairman of the League against Imperialism at its General Council meeting in Brussels; he was re-elected to the same post at the League&#x27;s 1929 Conference in Frankfurt.

In 1932, Maxton published a popular biography of Bolshevik leader V. I. Lenin. Maxton wrote of him: &quot;We are still too near to [Lenin] in time, too close to the happenings incidental to his work, too much under the influence of partisan antipathies or sympathies to venture final assessments. It is not yet possible to say that Russia has in practice realised the Utopian state of plenty, of liberty and of happiness, nor is it possible to say that other countries may not reach a better state in speedier and less harsh ways. It is possible to say that this man, quiet, unassuming, unimposing, set himself a task of immense size when still a boy, and stuck to it tenaciously to the end of his life.&quot;

In 1936, following the abdication of Edward VIII, Maxton proposed a &quot;republican amendment&quot; to the Abdication Bill, which would have turned the UK from a monarchy into a republic. Maxton argued that while the Monarchy had benefited Britain in the past, it had now &quot;outlived its usefulness&quot;. The amendment was defeated by 403 votes to five.

With Henk Sneevliet of the Dutch revolutionary communist party the RSP, Maxton headed deputations to civil war Spain on behalf of the international campaign for socialists there persecuted after the May Days of Barcelona. &quot;They harassed Republican Ministers with their questions and protests and proceeded to knock on the doors of the Communist Party&#x27;s secret prisons.&quot; Victor Serge described &quot;Maxton the imperturbable, with his angular face and steady grey eyes, pipe in mouth, heard the Spanish ministers Irujo and Zugazagoita — honest Republicans who had done their utmost to save the victims—reply to him: &#x27;These abominable acts are done against our will. Do you think we are safe ourselves?&#x27;&quot; Despite expecting to hear that the POUM Executive had been summarily executed, the campaign, according to Victor Serge in the 1940s, saved their lives (with the exception of Andreu Nin) and was &quot;a real moral triumph&quot;.

In his diary for 3 September 1939, Sir Ralph Glyn reported that &quot;James Maxton, the pacifist, rose, gaunt, a Horseman from the Apocalypse, doom written across his face,&quot; and declared, &quot;Don&#x27;t let&#x27;s talk of national honour: what do such phrases mean? The plain fact is that war means the slaughter of millions. If the Prime Minister can still maintain the peace, he will have saved those lives, he mustn&#x27;t be rushed.&quot;

During the Second World War, Maxton visited HM Prison Brixton to see Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists, who was then being detained under the Defence Regulations.

On 29 January 1942, Maxton was the only one out of 465 members of the House of Commons to vote against a Motion of Confidence in Winston Churchill&#x27;s wartime government.

===Death and legacy===
Maxton died of cancer in Largs, Ayrshire, in 1946, whilst sitting as MP for Bridgeton. He was cremated at Glasgow Crematorium. After his death, the ILP stagnated until it ceased to be a viable independent political party.

Maxton was considered one of the greatest orators of the time, both within and outside the House of Commons. Churchill, whilst holding political opinions wholly inconsistent with those of Maxton, described him as &quot;the greatest parliamentarian of his day&quot;. His biographer Graham Walker concludes:
:Maxton was one of the most charismatic figures in twentieth-century British public life. He was essentially a Scottish radical whose propagandist skills for the wider British labour movement have earned him folk hero status in socialist circles.

Maxton heavily influenced his family&#x27;s political opinions, and his mother and all his siblings also joined the ILP. His brother John was also a conscientious objector in the First World War. His son James and his nephew John Maxton were conscientious objectors to National Service after the Second World War. John went on to become Labour MP for the Cathcart division of Glasgow from 1979 to 2001 and was made a life peer in 2004.

Former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, published a biography, &quot;Maxton&quot;, based on his PhD thesis at the University of Edinburgh.

<doc id="240577" wikidata="Q962767" url="?curid=240577" title="Chesham">
<text>Chesham ( , ) is a market town and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, United Kingdom, south-east of the county town of Aylesbury, about north-west of central London, and part of the London commuter belt. It is in the Chess Valley, surrounded by farmland. The earliest records of Chesham as a settlement are from the second half of the 10th century, although there is archaeological evidence of people in this area from around 8000 BC. Henry III granted a royal charter for a weekly market in 1257.

Chesham is known for its &quot;four Bs&quot; boots, beer, brushes and Baptists. In the face of fierce competition from both home and abroad during the later 19th and early 20th centuries, the three traditional industries rapidly declined. The ready availability of skilled labour encouraged new industries to the town both before and after the Second World War. Today, employment in the town is provided mainly by small businesses engaged in light industry, technology and professional services.

From the early part of the 20th century, Chesham has experienced considerable expansion, with new housing developments and civic infrastructure. Chesham has become a commuter town with improved connection to London via the London Underground and road networks. The town centre has been progressively redeveloped since the 1960s and has been pedestrianised since the 1990s. The population at the 2021 census was 23,008.

==History==
There is archaeological evidence of the earliest settlement during the Late Mesolithic period around 5000 BC in East Street, Chesham where a large quantity of flint tools were found. The earliest farming evidence from the Neolithic era around 2500 BC. Bronze Age tribes settled in the valley around 1800 BC and they were succeeded by Iron Age Belgic people of the Catuvellauni tribe around 500 BC. Between 150 and 400 AD, there is evidence of Romano-British farming, and nearby at Latimer, there is archaeological evidence of a Roman villa and the planting of grapevines. However, the area was then deserted until the Saxon period around the 7th century.

Contrary to popular belief, the town is not named after the river; rather, the river is named after the town. The first recorded reference to Chesham is under the Old English name , meaning &quot;the river-meadow at the pile of stones&quot; around 970 in the will of Lady Ælfgifu, who has been identified with the former wife of King Eadwig. She held an estate here which she bequeathed to Abingdon Abbey.

Prior to 1066 there were three adjacent estates which comprised &quot;Caestreham&quot; which are briefly recorded in the Domesday Book as being of , 4 and hides, having four mills. The most important of these manors was held by Queen Edith, the widow of Edward the Confessor. Other land having been returned to the Crown it was in the hands of Harold Godwinson and his brother Leofwine Godwinson. Part of these later became Chesham Bois parish. After 1066 Edith kept her lands and William the Conqueror divided royal lands between his half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and Hugh de Bolbec.

===The land owners of Chesham===
The Domesday Book records that there were three manors in Cestreham and one at nearby Latimer. William the Conqueror shared out the estates between four of his dependants. The vast majority of land was granted to Hugh de Bolebec and smaller parcels to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, Toustain Mantel and Alsi.

Before the 13th century, the three Cestreham manors were known as Chesham Higham, Chesham Bury and Chesham Bois. In the 14th century they were first recorded as &#x27;the manors of Great Chesham&#x27;. Collectively they extended beyond the current Chesham town boundary. Together with the manor at Latimer they were held by the Earls of Oxford and Surrey. During the 16th century Greater Chesham was owned by the Seymour family who disposed of it to the Cavendish family who were the Earls and later Dukes of Devonshire. It is from the 15th century that the earliest surviving properties survive and are to be found close by the church in an area called &quot;the Nap&quot;, and along part of the present-day Church Street. Though gradually disposing of land the Cavendishes maintained an influence in the town until the 19th century. The Lowndes family started purchasing land from the 16th century. William Lowndes was an influential politician and Secretary to the Treasury during the reigns of Mary II, William III and Queen Anne. He rebuilt the original Bury and manor house of Great Chesham in 1712. The Lowndes family settled in Chesham and over the next 200 years became equally influential both nationally through politics and the law and locally within the town as its principal benefactors.

===Ecclesiastical history===
No evidence remains of any church prior to the Norman Conquest. However, the siting of puddingstones beneath the present-day church suggests a wooden church was constructed on the site during the Anglo-Saxon period. During the 12th century two families of Norman descent, the de Bolebecs and the Sifrewasts, each held a share of the advowson assigned to the adjacent manors of Chesham Higham and Chesham Bury respectively for the Church at Chesham which it is evidenced from about 1154 was dedicated to St Mary. These moieties were subsequently given by the families to two monasteries. In 1194 the de Bolbecs bestowed their advowson to the abbot and monks of Woburn Abbey and henceforth the parish of Chesham Higham was renamed &#x27;Chesham Woburn&#x27;. Meanwhile, and sometime before 1199, the Sifrewast family granted their advowson to the convent of St Mary&#x27;s de Pré Leicester. As a consequence the advowson for the parish of Chesham Bury became known as &#x27;Chesham Leicester&#x27;. In 1536 Henry VIII seized control of church property as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Subsequently, during Edward VI and Elizabeth I&#x27;s reigns, first Chesham Woburn and then Chesham Leicester advowsons became part of the estates of the Dukes of Bedford. Though there were originally two vicars appointed to the parish church of St Mary&#x27;s, from the 17th century a single incumbent was appointed. Jurisdiction was still shared between both advowsons and two parsonages, an &#x27;upper&#x27; and &#x27;lower&#x27;, continued to be maintained until the 18th century when both were superseded by a single new parsonage. The Duke of Bedford subsequently consolidated the moieties by Act of Parliament in 1767. To accommodate the increasing population during the 19th century, a new parish church was built in 1867; Christ Church at Waterside, and further churches were built at Ashley Green and Bellingdon, which were at the time both within the civil parish of Chesham. 

===Religious dissent and nonconformity===
Chesham is noted for the religious dissent which dominated the town from the 15th century. In 1532 Thomas Harding was burnt at the stake in the town for being a Lollard and heretic. From the 17th century, Chesham was a focus for those dissenting from mainstream religion. Quakers met in the late 17th century in Chesham and in 1798 they built the current meeting house. The first Baptists&#x27; meeting dates back to about 1640 and a place was registered for services in 1706. The first chapel was opened in 1712, one of many to be built for the various Baptist groups during the 18th and 19th centuries. John Wesley preached in Chesham in the 1760s and a Wesleyan Methodist society existed in the town. In more recent time a Wesleyan Methodist chapel was opened in 1897. The Christian Brethren which date back in Chesham to 1876, opened their Gospel Hall in 1895, which closed in December 2008. Broadway Baptist church had congregations at the Vale, Hawridge, Ashley Green and Chartridge; only the one at Chartridge survives. Trinity Baptist church had congregations at Hyde Heath, Ley Hill and Whelpley Hill; only the one at Hyde Heath survives. The Congregational Church had congregations at Asheridge and Pond Park.

===Emigration to the American colonies===
In 1630 Aquila Chase left Chesham to join the colony, settling first at Hampton (now New Hampshire), then Newbury, Massachusetts. Descendants of Aquila became influential in shaping political, legislative and commercial matters from the colonial period until after the Declaration of Independence. For example, Salmon P. Chase was the United States Treasury Secretary and Chief Justice in the 1870s. The Chase Manhattan Bank is named after him (although Chase did not have any connection with the bank).

===Industrial development===
The primary industries of the town in medieval times were flour production, woodworking and weaving of wool. There were four mills built along the Chess which was diverted to generate sufficient power. Surplus flour was supplied to London. The number of clothworkers, including spinners and those associated with dying (fullers), grew rapidly between 1530 and 1730 and became the major industry in the town prior to a period of rapid decline. Between 1740 and 1798, mills were converted to produce paper (pulp), responding to London&#x27;s insatiable demand for paper. However, technological developments in paper-making elsewhere rendered the mills unprofitable and they reverted to flour production in the 1850s.

New industries emerged from the 16th century onwards. The woodlands had been a source of firewood for London during the mediaeval period. A small-scale woodenware industry making shovels, brooms, spoons and chairs, began around 1538 and its expansion was accompanied by the planting of beechwoods between the 17th and 19th centuries. Straw plaiting was seen as home-based work for the wives and daughters of labourers from the 18th century. Straw was also imported from Italy to produce the superior &#x27;Tuscan plait&#x27; traded at a Saturday market for the Luton and Dunstable hat trade and remained the major cottage industry until around 1860, providing employment for women and girls, some of whom attended a &#x27;plait-school&#x27; in Waterside. Lace making developed in the 16th century as a cottage industry and was valued for its quality. Chesham specialised in black lace. The industry declined in the 1850s due to mechanisation in Nottingham. Between 1838 and 1864 silk-spinning, powered by a steam-driven mill in Waterside, was started to make use of unemployed lace workers. This trend was relatively short-lived as changes in fashion and the growth of the railways resulted in competition from elsewhere for the valuable London markets. However one exception was the firm of George Tutill which specialised in high-quality banners and was responsible for three-quarters of those made for trade unions. The firm is still a going concern, specialising in flags and banners.

Three of the four Bs that have shaped Chesham&#x27;s history relate to its industries. Brush making was introduced around 1829 to make use of the off-cuts from woodworking. Boot and shoe making which started as a cottage industry later expanding through small workshops, thrived following the opening of tanneries around 1792 which also supplied leather for saddle making and gloves. By the mid-19th century both brushmaking and footwear manufacture became major industries in the town with production concentrated in large factories. The industry declined in the early-20th century as the market for heavy boots declined. Beer brewing grew rapidly around the town centre in the 19th century again declining at the start of the 20th century. These traditional industries were succeeded by smaller but more commercial enterprises which took advantage of the available skilled labour. For example, in 1908 the Chiltern Toy Works was opened by Joseph Eisenmann on Bellingdon Road, later moving to the &#x27;new&#x27; industrial estate in Waterside, making high quality teddy bears. The works finally closed in 1960. Post Second World War industry has ranged from the manufacture of glue (Industrial Adhesives) to aluminium-based packaging (Alcan), Aluminium Castings &amp; Bronze Castings (Draycast Foundries Limited), balloons (B-Loony) and household cleaning products (Kilrock).

===The town in times of war===
Henry VIII imposed a tax on the town to pay for his wars against Scotland and France.

In common with the majority of communities in Buckinghamshire, Chesham&#x27;s Lollard heritage and puritan traditions ensured it would vehemently resist King Charles I&#x27;s demand for Ship Money; a tax on tradesmen and landowners. In 1635 the townsfolk of Chesham protested to the Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, Sir Peter Temple, who was reluctantly enforcing a writ requiring payment of a levy to the King. Not surprisingly given the local allegiances to John Hampden, the towns&#x27; people largely sided with the Parliamentarians at the outbreak of the English Civil War. During 1642 the influential Parliamentarians John Pym and Earl of Warwick were headquartered in the town along with large numbers of troops. There are records of skirmishes in the area during 1643 when Prince Rupert was stationed near Aylesbury and dispatched Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon to pillage nearby towns, such as Wendover. Heading toward Chesham a company of horse of the Parliamentary Army from the town met them outside Great Missenden where a skirmish took place ending with the Parliamentary force being driven back.

The records of the Posse Comitatus for Chesham in 1798 recorded over 800 men between the ages of 16 and 60 enrolled in a militia to defend the town in the event of invasion by Napoleon I or to deal with civil unrest. Less than 50 years later, in 1846, a similar register of 22 able-bodied men had been assembled to form the Chesham troop of the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry which coincided with the billeting of troops from the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars passing through the town on their way to Ireland.

During the First World War, 188 servicemen from Chesham lost their lives (see Landmarks). Alfred Burt, a corporal in the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment from Chesham, received the Victoria Cross for his actions in September 1915. The town provided temporary quarters for several regiments including the Kings Royal Rifles and the Royal Engineers honed their bridge building skills in local parks. In 1919, two &#x27;Victory Oaks&#x27; were planted in the town: one was planted by Margot Cavendish, Lady Chesham of Latimer House, Latimer, Buckinghamshire, and Major Lionel de Rothschild; the other by Mr. and Mrs. Lowndes (former owners of Lowndes Park), and Mr. and Mrs. Byrne (the chairman of Chesham Urban District Council and his wife).

Over the duration of the Second World War, 80 servicemen lost their lives. Air raid shelters were built by the Council in 1940, although the official view was that the town was unlikely to be targeted since its was not a strategic location. In fact at the end of the war it was estimated that 45 bombs fell in the Chesham area, killing at least nine people.

===Social history===
A Chesham workhouse for 90 paupers was operating in Germain Street as early as 1777. New legislation transferred the control of the Chesham institution to Amersham Poor Law Union in 1835. However, there were long-standing rivalries between the locals of both towns and in July that year violence broke out when an order was given to remove the paupers to Amersham. The Riot Act was read out to an angry crowd of 500 and arrests followed.

Publicly funded education started with the opening of a British School in 1825 followed by a National School in 1845, an Infants&#x27; School in 1851 and the first Elementary School for girls in 1864. Chesham Building Society opened for business in 1845 and continued to operate until June 2010, when it was taken over by the Skipton Building Society. Other public institutions also started at this time, with a Fire Brigade being established in 1846, the first cemetery in 1858 and a police station built in 1861.

Chesham cottage hospital, built for £865 17s 11d on land provided by Lord Chesham, opened in October 1869, just ahead of an outbreak of typhoid in 1871. Despite a local campaign to save the hospital it closed in 2005. In September 2010 the derelict hospital building was severely damaged by a fire caused by arsonists, according to police reports. The Council commissioned a waterworks to be built in 1875 in Alma Road and mains drainage in the town and a sewage works was opened adjacent to the Chess, downstream in 1887. A gasworks was constructed on the southern part of the town in 1847. Bathing in the Chess at Waterside was an old tradition which became increasingly popular in the 19th century. Complaints that it had become a nuisance led to the Urban District Council surrounding the site with a concrete wall. This further increased its popularity and an open-air pool was built by the council in 1912.

Transport connections have always come late to the town. The Metropolitan Railway eventually reached Chesham in July 1889. Electrification was not to come until the 1960s. Between the two world wars and in the 1950s and 60s there was much expansion in the town with new public housing developments along the Missenden Road, at Pond Park and at Botley.

The first public viewings of cinema films in Chesham were provided by travelling showmen around 1900 and attracted large crowds. The first purpose-built cinema, &quot;The Empire Picture Hall&quot;, opened in Station Road in 1912 and in 1914 &quot;The Chesham Palace&quot; started up in The Broadway. Both showed silent films. By 1920 the Empire had closed. In 1930 the Chesham Palace was refurbished to show the new &#x27;talkies&#x27; and reopened as &quot;The Astoria&quot; which remained in business until 1959 when the arrival of television forced it to close. &quot;The Embassy&quot; in Germain Street opened in 1935 and survived until 1982, closing due to competition from cinemas in nearby towns. &quot;The Elgiva Theatre&quot;, completed in 1976 beside St Mary&#x27;s Way, was equipped to show films and on moving to a new site just across the road in 1998 state of the art projection equipment was installed in the new theatre (see image below).

==Geography==
The town is in the Chess Valley 13 miles south-east of the county town Aylesbury and is 25 miles (40 km) north west of central London. It is the fourth largest town in the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire and the largest in Chiltern District, with a population of some 20,343 people behind Milton Keynes with 184,500, High Wycombe with 118,200 and Aylesbury with 69,200. Nearby Amersham has 17,719.

===Topography and geology===
Chesham is in the Chiltern Hills and from its lowest point of above sea level rises up valley sides. It lies at the confluence of four dry valleys formed by the meltwater at the end of the last ice age which deposited onto the bed rock of chalk, alluvial gravels, silts, on which the town now sits. Subsequent periods of subsidence and submergence deposited clays and flints. The River Chess is a chalk-stream which rises from three springs; to the north-west along the Pednor Vale at Frogmoor, at Higham Mead to the north of the town, and to the west near the Amersham Road which converge in the town near to East Street. The river was known as the &quot;Isen&quot; from at least the 12th century when it is found contributing to the name of the nearby hamlet of Isenhampstead, later to divide and become the manors of Isenhampstead Chenies and Isenhampstead Latimer and persisting until the 19th century. It has been suggested, but not established, that the old name &#x27;Isen&#x27;, which derives from the Anglo-Saxon word for iron, refers to the chalybeate or iron-charged spring waters which feed the river Today the streams are culverted and conducted below street level before emerging at Waterside and flowing in a south easterly direction towards Latimer. From there it flows to the north of Chenies and on towards Rickmansworth after which it joins the River Colne.

===Built environment and social geography===
Chesham developed as a market town which prospered through its manufacturing industries fuelled by a series of mills which sprung up along the River Chess. Until the 19th century the town was centred to the south-eastern end of the present High Street. Most of the present-day town centre&#x27;s development took place during Victorian times. The &#x27;old town&#x27;, particularly Church and Germain Street, has been well preserved and now designated a conservation area. It includes a number of impressive residential, institutional and commercial buildings that largely survived Victorian &#x27;improvement&#x27;. The 12th century St Mary&#x27;s Church, which underwent refurbishment and redesign by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century. &#x27;The Bury&#x27;, a Queen Anne town house was built in 1712 for William Lowndes Secretary to the Treasury. Chesham had two workhouses, both buildings survived and are located in Germain Street. In June 2009 the Chesham town centre and old town conservation area was placed on the English Heritage Conservation Areas at Risk register which the District Council commented was due to the misinterpretation of its responses to the conservation body&#x27;s questionnaire. Due to the pattern of the town&#x27;s expansion there are several centres of employment which are interspersed with residential housing. Industrial buildings on the north side of the town have been redeveloped into offices in recent years.

The town had a population of 2,425 by 1841. This had increased to more to 9,000 by the end of the 19th century. As a consequence the centre of the town shifted to the east as shops, workshops and cottages sprung up along the High Street and Berkhampstead Road. In the period after the Second World War the town centre was progressively redeveloped. In the 1960s St Mary&#x27;s Way was constructed, rerouting the A416 around the congested High Street which avoided the need to widen the street, conserved its character and allowed for its pedestrianisation during the 1990s. Industrial development became centred on two areas. At the southern end of the town at Waterside which was the site of the first mills and factories in the 18th and 19th centuries there is a mixture of original and newly constructed industrial units and at the northern end along the Asheridge Vale there is a further development of generally small commercial business units.

Compared to other towns in south Buckinghamshire, there are fewer detached and owner-occupied houses and a higher proportion of social rental accommodation. Expansion in housing has occurred in several phases mainly to the east of the old town where artisan&#x27;s housing sprung up along Berkhamsted Road and subsequently along the many steep valley sides. Initially this development was as a consequence of the extension of the railway to the town in the 1880s, subsequently the promotion of Metroland during the 1920s and the electrification of the Metropolitan line in the 1960s. Pond Park estate was built in the 1930s. The population grew fast after the Second World War as workers followed employers who moved out from London. The population in 1951 was 11,500 leading to the building of the Chessmount and Hilltop estates by speculative developers in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. By 1971 the population had reached 20,000 since when it has only increased slightly. The growing popularity of the Chilterns as a place to live from the latter part of the 20th century onwards led to restrictions on housing and industrial development in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and has sustained the demand for further house building in the town. Today an increasing number of those in employment find work outside the town, commuting by car or train as well as an increasing number who are home or office-based using technology to make a living.

===Climate===
Chesham experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to almost all of the United Kingdom, although the lower parts of the valley have significant frost hollow characteristics – being several degrees colder than surrounding areas on clear, calm nights and so have much lower average minimum temperatures than shown in the table. The lowest recorded temperature in Chesham was on 20 December 2010 at a private weather station, which was also the coldest place in the UK on that date. On 12 February 2012, the coldest day in Britain since December 2010, temperatures in Chesham fell to again the lowest in the country on that date.

 

===Neighbourhoods and wards===
The town comprises the following communities:
* Asheridge Vale, stretches along Asheridge Road on the north-west edge of the town. The large housing development was built during the mid 20th century along with an industrial estate comprising manufacturing and light industrial units which has since undergone diversification into offices and small businesses. Also a town council ward.
* Botley, a hamlet located to the east of the town of Chesham between Lye Green and Ley Hill (the latter in Latimer parish). Part of Townsend ward.
* Chesham Vale, area on the northern edge of the town on the road to the villages of Hawridge and Cholesbury. Also a town council ward called Vale.
* Chessmount, area to the east of the town centre. Part of Waterside ward.
* Codmore, ancient hamlet located to the north-east of the town centre, at the junction between the roads to Lye Green and Botley. Part of Hilltop ward.
* Great Hivings, an area to the north of Chesham on the road to Bellingdon (the latter in Chartridge parish). Part of the ward called Ridgeway.
* Hilltop, residential area to the north-east of the town built on steeply sloping ground. Consists primarily of steel framed bungalows. Also the name of a town council ward.
* Lye Green, hamlet located to the north east of the main town. Part of Newtown ward.
* Lowndes, residential area which includes the Chiltern Hills Academy School, close to the centre of the town, adjacent to Lowndes Park. Also a town council ward.

* Newtown, late Victorian housing development to the north of the town, now incorporated into the enlarged townscape. Also a town council ward.
* Old Town, until the arrival of the Metropolitan Railway in the 19th century was the town&#x27;s centre. Today, St Mary&#x27;s Church, the historic houses and streetscape are part of a designated Conservation Area lying to the south of the present town centre with which it comprises St. Mary&#x27;s ward.
* Pednormead End, an area to the west of the main town, along Missenden Road. Part of St. Mary&#x27;s ward.
* Pond Park, an area comprising post Second World War housing to the north of the town. Part of the Ridgeway Ward.
* Townsend, Victorian extension to the town comprising commercial premises, later 20th century residential developments and Chesham Grammar School. Also a town council ward.
* Waterside, once a hamlet located just south of the town centre. Several mills sprung up along the River Chess which flows through the area as well as factories. It still retains a distinct character with a large open space known as the Moor. Also a town council ward.
==Landmarks==

===Clock tower===
A clock tower constructed in 1992 stands in Market Square on the site of Chesham&#x27;s 18th-century town hall demolished in 1965. The turret is a reconstruction of the one built onto the original town hall in the 19th century and features the original glass-dialled clock face and clock mechanism from the mid 19th century.

===War memorial===
Chesham war memorial stands in a landscaped garden in the Broadway. It depicts an infantryman with his rifle inverted and commemorates those who fell during the First and Second World Wars. It was designed by the sculptor Arthur George Walker and unveiled in 1921. The inscription reads:- &quot;To The Glorious Memory Of The Men Of The Town Who Gave Their Lives And To Honour:&quot; &quot;All Who Served Or Suffered In Cause Of God King And Country Their Deeds Live After Them Faithful Unto Death&quot;.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
There is evidence during the pre-Norman period of common fields being divided into parcels and strips of land. The Domesday Book records Chesham with sufficient arable land to support four water-powered corn mills on the River Chess producing a surplus of flour exported to London. There was woodland to feed over 1600 pigs and supply timber for local manufacturing of farm tools (ploughshares). Field enclosure started in the early 16th century and although almost completed by the mid 19th century the productivity of Chesham farms provided work for over 450 agricultural labourers. Sheep that grazed on the hillside fields around Chesham provided wool for the cloth making and dying cottage industry which, due to the town&#x27;s proximity to London, thrived until the 18th century when Yorkshire mills out-competed them.

===Industrial Revolution===
Until the 18th century, the economic activity of Chesham had remained largely unchanged since the granting of its town charter in 1257. The commercial planting of beechwoods established Chesham as one of a number of local centres in the Chilterns for the production of turned furniture components and other wooden items often called bodging, produced in local workshops. Mills along the Chess concerned with papermaking and silk weaving continued to operate until the middle of the 19th century, as did &#x27;outworkers&#x27; engaged in lace making and straw plaiting, whose employment was impacted on by changes in fashion and due to mechanisation and from cheaper imports from the continent. The mineral-laden, unpolluted water of the Chess made it ideal for growing watercress and this industry flourished in Chesham in the Victorian era, with beds extending along the Chess towards Latimer, which continued in operation until after the Second World War.

===Manufacturing and brewing===
In the 18th century, home-based leather trade workers moved to the newly opened Barnes Boot factory, and to the Britannia Boot and Shoe Works towards the end of the 19th century. By this time, there were eight major manufacturers and many small workshops. In 1829 Beechwoods brushmaking factory was opened. At its height there were around 12 factories specialising in brushes made from locally grown beech, with bristles imported mainly from across Asia. The adoption of nylon for brushes was the cause of the downturn with only one manufacturer remaining today, Russell&#x27;s Brushes.

Nash&#x27;s Chesham Brewery opened in the High Street in 1841. Two other notable rivals were Darvell&#x27;s Brewery and Sarah Howe and Sons. Competition led to amalgamations around the start of the 20th century although brewing continued at Chesham Brewery until the 1950s.

===Commerce today===

Today Chesham has a diverse economic base comprising many typically small-medium-sized enterprises representing all business sectors. Within the two industrial parks light engineering and fabrication industry is to be found alongside printers and graphic designers or other technology-based firms, wholesalers, distribution and courier businesses. As elsewhere, there has been an expansion of professional business services and consultancies. The pedestrianised High Street retains some of the character of the old market town with some long-established traditional family retailers and also features a street market on Wednesdays and Saturdays. This individuality was recognised in a survey of town &#x27;high streets&#x27; which gave Chesham good marks for its distinctiveness. There are two of the &#x27;big five&#x27; supermarkets present which have impacted on the town&#x27;s independent stores and all retail outlets have also to compete with other nearby town centres, at Amersham, Berkhamsted and Tring as well as the large shopping centres in High Wycombe, Watford and Milton Keynes.

==Governance==
===Parliamentary representation===

The town was part of the Aylesbury constituency from 1885 to 1974. Since the boundary changes that were made ahead of the February 1974 general election, Chesham has been in the Chesham &amp; Amersham constituency. The constituency was traditionally solidly Conservative; it never returned a non-Tory candidate until a by-election in June 2021 following the death of previous MP Cheryl Gillan returned the present Liberal Democrat MP, Sarah Green.

===Local government===
Chesham has two tiers of local government: Chesham Town Council and Buckinghamshire Council. Chesham Town Council is based at Chesham Town Hall.

The parish of Chesham was made a Local Government District in 1884, governed by a local board, which then became Chesham Urban District Council in 1894. The urban district council was abolished in 1974, merging with the neighbouring Amersham Rural District to become Chiltern District, whilst Chesham Town Council was established as a successor parish covering the area of the abolished urban district. Chiltern District was abolished in 2020, merging with the other Buckinghamshire authorities to become a unitary authority called Buckinghamshire Council.

===Coat of arms===
Chesham Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms in 1961, which subsequently transferred to Chesham Town Council. The colours are the same as those of Buckinghamshire County arms. The Chiltern woodlands are denoted by two beech trees. The river Chess is recognised in the black and white chequers and rooks. The swan is inherited from the Dukes of Buckingham. The lilies relate to St Mary, patron saint of the parish church.
The buck&#x27;s head is borrowed from the arms of The Cavendish family, which owned most of the parish lands. The motto is from the Epistle to the Galatians, Chapter V, Verse 13.

==Public services==
===Emergency services===

Thames Valley Police headquartered in Kidlington, Oxfordshire is accountable for the delivery of policing through the town&#x27;s three Neighbourhood Policing Teams. Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service based in Aylesbury oversees the town&#x27;s fire and rescue services. There is a fire station located in Bellingdon Road which is supplemented by services from the station at Amersham and other nearby towns. Ambulance services are managed by South Central Ambulance Service NHS Trust based in Bicester, Oxford. The nearest ambulance station is located in Amersham.

===Health services===
Buckinghamshire NHS Primary Care Trust has overall responsibility for the provision of health services to the local community. Since the closure of the town&#x27;s cottage hospital in 2004, the nearest hospitals are Amersham Hospital, Wycombe Hospital and Stoke Mandeville Hospital. After several years of uncertainty, in 2008 the PCT confirmed it was proceeding with the Chesham Healthzone Project. Planning approval was granted by the district council in June 2009 for the purpose-built health facility comprising, two GP practices, a pharmacy, consulting, clinical and treatment rooms. Originally scheduled to open in 2010, phase 1 of the Chess Medical Centre opened in December 2011.

===Utilities===
Veolia Water Central supplies drinking water to the town extracted from the River Chess and Misbourne and from aquifers in the Chiltern Hills. Thames Water undertakes waste water treatment and has a sewage treatment works beside the River Chess on Latimer Road to the south of the town. Chiltern District Council is responsible for waste management and collection and disposal is currently carried out on its behalf by Serco. EDF Energy provides electricity supply for the town.

==Religion==

The oldest church building in Chesham is St. Mary&#x27;s Church which dates from at least the 12th century. Chesham has a long history of religious dissent, such as the persecuted Lollards, followers of the John Wycliffe tradition. One of them, Thomas Harding, was martyred on White Hill, near Dungrove Farm, in 1532. The Amersham Martyrs Memorial commemorates the execution of local Lollards in Amersham, and there are memorials to Thomas Harding in the churchyard and on White Hill. The 17th, 18th and 19th centuries saw the rapid growth of non-conformism especially Baptists. During the English civil war there were groups of Quakers, Baptists and Presbyterians. Broadway Baptist Church dates back to at least 1706 and had its 300th anniversary celebrations in Chesham in 2006. Its roots are in the Chesham and Berkhamsted Baptist Church which dates back to 1640.

In the present day, Chesham has four Baptist churches (Broadway Baptist, Trinity Baptist and Newtown Baptist) and four Anglican churches (St Mary&#x27;s, Christ Church in Waterside, Hope Church, formerly called Hiving&#x27;s Free Church, in Upper Belmont Road and Emmanuel in Newtown). There is a United Reformed Church, formerly called the Congregational Church, in The Broadway, there was a Gospel Hall in Station Road (which closed at the end of 2008), a Roman Catholic church (St Columba&#x27;s) in Berkhampstead Road (built in 1960), a Methodist chapel in Bellingdon Road, a Salvation Army Citadel in Broad St (closed in 2015), an historic Quaker Friends Meeting House in Bellingdon Road, The King&#x27;s Church charismatic fellowship which meets at Chesham Park Community College. Almost all of the Christian churches of Chesham work collectively as part of the Churches Together for Chesham (CTfC) group, which has 16 churches in membership. Other religious groups include Chesham Spiritualist Church in Higham Road and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses off Bellingdon Road.

During the Second World War, the first recorded Jewish congregation was founded by families evacuated from London who used to meet at the cricket pavilion. After the war, they combined with the Jewish community in Amersham which met at the synagogue in Amersham-on-the-Hill until 1968. This was succeeded by a Liberal Jewish community formed in 1990 which now meets at Chesham Grammar School.

During the second half of the 20th century, a sizeable Muslim community became established in the town. Chesham Mosque, the first purpose-built mosque, was completed in 2005 and is located in Bellingdon Road.

==Demography==

==Transport==
===Rail===
Chesham tube station, close to the town centre, is the terminus of the Chesham branch, a single-track spur off the London Underground Metropolitan line connecting to Chalfont &amp; Latimer station. The station was opened on 8 July 1889 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR). The line had been intended to extend to Tring with connections to the London and North Western Railway″s West Coast Main Line. However, the MR chose an alternative route across the Chilterns and so the idea was abandoned and the Metropolitan line continued to Aylesbury via Amersham. There were some sizeable goods yards beyond the station, which were closed and now function as Waitrose&#x27;s car park except for one portion occupied by coal merchants.

In 1959 electrification of the Metropolitan line to Chesham provided a more reliable connection to London. With the cessation of London Underground services to Aylesbury in 1961 and to Ongar in 1994, Chesham became the furthest location served from central London, in terms of both distance and travelling time. Prior to December 2010, apart from a few direct trains to London at peak times, a shuttle service operated to and from Chalfont &amp; Latimer. Since then the town has benefited from direct trains to London all day.

The nearest National Rail connections are at Amersham, although the LU line also connects directly to Chalfont &amp; Latimer station, from where the Metropolitan line and Chiltern Railways provide a joint service with Metropolitan line trains travelling to Baker Street and Aldgate and Chiltern Railways trains travelling to Marylebone. There is also access to London via Berkhamsted railway station on the West Coast Main Line.

===Roads===
In contrast to other towns in south Buckinghamshire, Chesham historically was not well served by road transport links. The stage coach bypassed the town and, unlike Amersham, there were no turnpikes and consequently roads were poorly maintained. Significant change occurred in the post Second World War period with the opening of the M1 motorway. The A416 now runs through the town, from Amersham to Berkhamsted, and connects the town to the more recently upgraded A41. The A416 was diverted around the High Street and later upgraded to be dual-lane. Although these improvements enable more through traffic, traffic congestion has increased. Chesham&#x27;s High Street was pedestrianised in 1990 and the benefits to the High Street have been felt ever since. Whilst some of the previous bustle has been lost, the impact of pedestrianisation has generally been positive.

===Bus services===
Bus companies running local services include Carousel Buses]], Red Rose, Redline and Red Eagle.

Residential areas of the town are connected with the central shopping-area. Chesham is also connected by services to nearby Amersham, and further afield to High Wycombe, Hemel Hempstead, and Uxbridge.
Less frequent services run to Aylesbury and to surrounding villages.

===Car usage and parking===
There are six pay and display car parks in the town, managed by Chiltern District Council. This demand for parking reflects the relatively high car usage, a result of both affluence and the limited public transport provision in rural areas. As a consequence
Chiltern District has the 4th highest carbon footprint of all local authorities.

===Cycling===
There is limited provision for cycle use within the town. The town is one setting off point for exploring the Chilterns and cycling heritage trails have been developed by the district authority, two of which are centred on countryside around Chesham.

===Air transport===
Luton airport is 15 miles away and Heathrow airport 22 miles away. The Bovingdon stack is directly above the town.

==Education==

===Primary education===
Between the 1960s and the mid-1990s Primary education provision in Chesham was organised into First (ages 4–8) and Middle (ages 8 – 12) with some Combined Schools taking pupils across the whole age range (4 -12). In 1996 the arrangements were modified and the age of transfer to Secondary education was changed to age 11. The schools still retain some elements of the previous arrangement reflected in their names. There are six Primary Schools within Chesham with catchment areas based on post codes: – Elmtree First School, Newtown Infant School, Brushwood Junior School, Thomas Harding Junior School, Ivingswood Academy (previously Little Spring Primary School), Waterside Combined School. Attendance by Chesham children at some of the village schools close to the town is popular.

===Secondary education===
At secondary level, Buckinghamshire continues to operate a system of selective education with pupils sitting the eleven plus exam to determine entry to either a Grammar school or Secondary Modern School (also known locally as an Upper School). Two Secondary Schools are located in the town: – Chiltern Hills Academy, a co-educational Church of England Academy, previously known as Chesham Park Community College which was formed from the merger of Lowndes School and Cestreham School) and Chesham Grammar School, a co-educational grammar school, which until May 2010 was called Chesham High School. Chesham also falls within the catchment areas of two further grammar schools, Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School for boys&#x27; in Amersham and Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School for girls in Little Chalfont.

In the Chiltern and South Bucks area around Chesham and over the county border in Hertfordshire there are also a number of independent fee-paying schools providing education between ages 4–13 and up to age 18. Chesham Preparatory School is an independent school which opened in 1938 in the town and shortly after relocated to the outskirts of Chesham at Orchard Leigh, providing fee-paying and scholarship-supported education.

===Special, further and adult education provision===
Chesham is the location of a nationally renowned Special school, Heritage House School which first opened in April 1968 and caters for pupils between the ages of 2 and 19 with severe learning difficulties.
A Further education college Amersham &amp; Wycombe College was founded in 1973 and has one of its four campuses in the town on the former Cestreham Senior Boys School at Lycrome Road. The college caters for a range of student cohorts with 2000 students on full-time courses and 5000 on a part-time bases.
Adult learning comprising a range of provision including academic, vocational and leisure courses, is provided a four sites in the town. Chesham Adult Learning Centre in Charteridge Lane, ElmTree School, ElmTree Hill, The Douglas McMinn Centre in East Street and The White Hill Centre White Hill.
The Chess Valley section of the Chiltern University of the Third Age (U3A) was formed in October 2008 in response to increasing demand for activities in the area and meets at St Mary&#x27;s Church.

==Culture and recreation==

===Community facilities===

The Elgiva Hall opened on its original location in 1976. In 1998, having made way for an enlarged supermarket development the Elgiva was rebuilt as a purpose-built theatre on its current site and reopened as the New Elgiva. Now rebranded &quot;The Elgiva&quot; it is a 300 seated/400 standing capacity theatre, with a Dolby Digital 35mm cinema and is owned and managed by Chesham Town Council. The Elgiva presents a wide-ranging programme of professional and amateur theatre productions, musicals, comedy, dance, one night shows and concerts, pantomimes, films, exhibitions and other public and private events by both professional and community organisations. The Little Theatre by the Park is a facility owned by the Town Council and leased to the Little Theatre Trustees. It is the home to the Chesham Bois Catholic Players and used by other local theatre companies and is used for dance and exercise groups.

Chesham Museum is a newly established museum for the town and surrounding area which opened in 2004 having first been conceived in 1981. Initially it was housed in temporary premises at The Stables behind the Gamekeeper&#x27;s Lodge Pub in Bellingdon Road. Since October 2009 it has been located at 15 Market Square. There is also an annual Schools of Chesham carnival, Beer festival and bi-annual Chesham festival.

Chesham Library opened in Chesham in 1923 in a room at Cemetery Lodge on Berkhamsted Road. In 1927, it moved into new premises at 33 High Street on the Broadway which it shared with Chesham Urban District Council. After the war it expanded. A children&#x27;s section was added in 1952. In 1971 the library moved to Elgiva Lane, a site it shared with the Elgive Theatre prior to the latter&#x27;s relocation to new premises. Since then it has been updated to provide better access and improved internal facilities including the evolution of the reference library into a Study Centre. It also houses a special collection of Victorian era children&#x27;s books including some previously owned by Florence Nightingale.

The White Hill Centre, the site of an old school, is run by Chesham and District Community Association and since 1976 has provided educational, recreational social activities and facilities for societies and the local community to meet.
Opposite the town centre is Lowndes Park, a large park with playgrounds and formerly an open air paddling pool. There is a large pond in the park, known as Skottowe&#x27;s Pond. Lowndes Park was donated to the town of Chesham in 1953. Prior to this it was part of the garden that belonged to the Lowndes family. The Moor, originally an island created by the diversion of the Chess to power mills is today an open space used for recreation and the location for travelling fairs which moved from their traditional location in the town centre in 1938. There are two public swimming pools in the town. An outdoor pool at the Moor in Waterside and a roofed pool (and leisure centre), next to Chesham Grammar School at the top of White Hill. The Town Council manages 227 allotments spread across three sites. There are 135 footpaths in the Chesham area and in May 2010 the town became the first in the Chilterns to be recognised as a &quot;Walkers are Welcome Town&quot;.

===Sport===
Chesham United F.C. is the local football club which plays in the Southern League .v At the end of the 2009–2010 season it was promoted to the Premier Division. It was formed in 1917 through the merger of Chesham Generals (the team of the Chesham General Baptist church now called Broadway Baptist Church), which was founded in 1887, and Chesham Town FC (started as the football team of Christ Church, Waterside), a founding member of the Southern League which started out in 1894 as Chesham FC. The club&#x27;s most successful period was during the 1967–68 season when it reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup at Wembley but lost out to Leytonstone F.C. 1–0 in front of a crowd of 54,000. The club has struggled financially and performance-wise over recent years but has recently had a cash injection from a new financial backer.
Chesham cricket club was founded in 1848 and is one of the oldest clubs in the Thames Valley Cricket League. Its home ground is at Amy Lane. In addition to four senior Saturday XIs it also runs two Sunday XIs and a women&#x27;s side. Chesham also has a Junior section, which competes in Buckinghamshire and national competitions.
Chesham Rugby union Club (&#x27;The Stags&#x27;), was founded in 1980 and play rugby for boys, girls and adult men and women at Chiltern Hills Academy. The Stags also run netball teams playing in local leagues for girls and women.

===Town twinning and cultural exchanges===

Chesham has twinned with three towns in other countries. It is organised by the Chesham Town Twinning Association. The first link-up was in 1980 with Friedrichsdorf, at the foot of the Taunus Hills near Frankfurt, Germany. Next followed the association with Houilles, a commune of Paris, France, in 1986 and thirdly, in 1995 a tie-up with Archena, in the Murcia region of Spain.
Some organisations also have international links. Emmanuel Church is linked with a church in Prague, Czech Republic. Chesham British Legion is linked with its Canadian equivalent in Buckingham, Quebec. Ley Hill Methodist Church is linked with Skopje Methodist Church in Macedonia.

==Media, communications and filmography==

===Local news media===
The local newspaper covering Chesham and the surrounding area, although it no longer has an office based in the town, is the &quot;Buckinghamshire Examiner&quot; founded in 1889. Another Buckinghamshire newspaper with a circulation area covering Chesham is the &quot;Bucks Free Press&quot;.

===Local Radio===
Radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio and Heart London. 

The Ofcom licensed community radio station for the Chilterns is &quot;Chiltern Voice&quot;, which broadcasts on 107.4fm.

===TV and mobile phone signals===
Due to its position in a fold in the hill, TV and radio reception in Chesham can be poor and the town now has its own TV mast. In the 1970s, Chesham was one of the last towns in the south east to receive BBC2, and parts of it still cannot receive Channel 5. Houses taking their TV reception from the Chesham transmitter have vertically polarised aerials, whilst those in a good enough position receive their signal from the Crystal Palace Transmitter in London with horizontally polarised aerials – they always could receive BBC2 (and indeed Channel 4 &amp; Channel 5). Digital terrestrial television coverage is patchy for much the same reason. Mobile phone reception can be poor in the steeper parts of Chesham and outlying villages.

<doc id="240578" wikidata="Q1757551" url="?curid=240578" title="List of political parties in the United Kingdom">
<text>The Electoral Commission&#x27;s Register of Political Parties lists the details of political parties registered to contest elections in the United Kingdom, including their registered name. Under current electoral law, including the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, the Electoral Administration Act 2006, and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, only registered party names can be used on ballot papers by those wishing to fight elections. Candidates who do not belong to a registered party can use &quot;independent&quot; or no label at all. , the Electoral Commission showed the number of registered political parties in Great Britain and Northern Ireland as 393.

Before the middle of the 19th century, politics in the United Kingdom was dominated by the Whigs and the Tories. These were not political parties in the modern sense but somewhat loose alliances of interests and individuals. The Whigs included many of the leading aristocratic dynasties committed to the Protestant succession, and later drew support from elements of the emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants, while the Tories were associated with the landed gentry, the Church of England and the Church of Scotland.

By the mid 19th century, the Tories had evolved into the Conservative Party, and the Whigs had evolved into the Liberal Party. The concept of right and left came originally from France, where the supporters of a monarchy (constitutional or absolute) sat on the right wing of the National Assembly, and republicans on the left. In the late 19th century, the Liberal Party began to lean towards the left. Liberal Unionists split off from the Liberals over Irish Home Rule and moved closer to the Conservatives over time.

The Liberals and Conservatives dominated the political scene until the 1920s, when the Liberal Party declined in popularity and suffered a long stream of resignations. It was replaced as the main anti-Tory opposition party by the newly emerging Labour Party, which represented an alliance between the labour movement, organised trades unions and various socialist societies.

Since then, the Conservative and Labour parties have dominated British politics, and have alternated in government ever since. However, the UK is not quite a two-party system as other parties have significant support. The Liberal Democrats were the third largest party until the 2015 general election when they were overtaken by the Scottish National Party in terms of seats and UK political party membership, and by the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in terms of votes. The Liberal Democrats regained the status of the third largest political party in the UK by seats with the outcome of the 2024 United Kingdom general election.
The UK&#x27;s first-past-the-post electoral system leaves small parties disadvantaged on a UK-wide scale. It can, however, allow parties with concentrations of supporters in the constituent countries to flourish. In the 2015 election, there was widespread controversy when the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the Green Party of England and Wales received 4.9 million votes (12.6% of the total vote for UKIP and 3.8% for the Greens) yet only gained one seat each in the House of Commons. After that election, UKIP, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, and the Green Party of England and Wales, together with its Scottish and Northern Ireland affiliated parties, delivered a petition signed by 477,000 people to Downing Street demanding electoral reform.

Since 1997, proportional representation-based voting systems have been adopted for elections to the Scottish Parliament, the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), the Northern Ireland Assembly, the London Assembly and (until Brexit in 2020) the UK&#x27;s seats in the European Parliament. In these bodies, other parties have had success.

Traditionally political parties have been private organisations with no official recognition by the state. The Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 changed that by creating a register of parties.

Membership of political parties has been in decline in the UK since the 1950s. Membership has fallen by over 65% since 1983, from 4% of the electorate to 1.3% in 2005.

== Parties with representation in the House of Commons ==

==Parties without representation in the House of Commons, but with representation in other UK legislatures==
There are a few political parties in the United Kingdom that do not have representation in the House of Commons, but have elected representatives in the Northern Ireland Assembly and Scottish Parliament. These are:

==Party descriptions==
==Elected representatives at principal level of local government in the United Kingdom==
===Great Britain-wide or UK-wide parties===
===Parties that only stand in a nation of the UK (i.e. England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, or Wales) or a region===
===Local parties===
==No elected representation at principal level== 
This is a table of notable minor parties. Many parties are registered with the Electoral Commission but do not qualify for this list as they have not received significant independent coverage. Parties active across Ireland may have representation in the Republic of Ireland but not Northern Ireland.

<text>The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics was founded in 1927 in Berlin, Germany. The Rockefeller Foundation partially funded the actual building of the Institute and helped keep the Institute afloat during the Great Depression.

==Eugenics==

In its early years, and during the Nazi era, it was strongly associated with theories of Nazi eugenics and racial hygiene advocated by its leading theorists Fritz Lenz, (first director) Eugen Fischer, and by its second director Otmar von Verschuer.
In the years of 1937–1938, Fischer and his colleagues analysed 600 children in Nazi Germany descending from French-African soldiers who occupied western areas of Germany after First World War; the children, the so-called Rhineland Bastards, were subsequently subjected to sterilization.

Fischer did not officially join the Nazi Party until 1940. However, he was influential with National Socialists early on. Adolf Hitler read his two-volume work, &quot;Principles of Human Heredity and Race Hygiene&quot; (first published in 1921 and co-written by Erwin Baur and Fritz Lenz) while incarcerated in 1923 and used its ideas in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. He also authored &quot;The Rehoboth Bastards and the Problem of Miscegenation among Humans&quot; (1913) (), a field study which provided context for later racial debates, influenced German colonial legislation and provided scientific support for the Nuremberg laws.

Under the Nazi regime, Fischer developed the physiological specifications used to determine racial origins and developed the so-called Fischer–Saller scale. He and his team experimented on Romani people and African-Germans, especially those from Namibia, taking blood and measuring skulls to find scientific validation for his theories.

During World War II, the Institute regularly received human body parts, including eyes and skulls, from Nazi party member Karin Magnussen who studied eye colors, and Josef Mengele (at Auschwitz concentration camp) to use in studies intended to prove Nazi racial theories and justify race-related social policies. After the German capitulation in May 1945, most of the thousands of files and lab material of the Institute were moved to an unknown location or destroyed, and never obtained by the Allies to use as evidence in war crimes trials and to prove or disprove the Nazi racial ideology which had motivated mass genocide in Europe. Most of the staff of the Institute were able to escape trial, most notably Mengele who escaped to Brazil, where he died of a stroke while swimming in 1979.

Efforts to return the Namibian skulls taken by Fischer were started with an investigation by the University of Freiburg in 2011 and completed with the return of the skulls in March 2014 to Namibia.

== Funding ==
When confronted with financial demands, the Rockefeller Foundation supported both the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Psychiatry and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics.

<text>Market research is an organized effort to gather information about target markets and customers. It involves understanding who they are and what they need. It is an important component of business strategy and a major factor in maintaining competitiveness. Market research helps to identify and analyze the needs of the market, the market size and the competition. Its techniques encompass both qualitative techniques such as focus groups, in-depth interviews, and ethnography, as well as quantitative techniques such as customer surveys, and analysis of secondary data.

It includes social and opinion research, and is the systematic gathering and interpretation of information about individuals or organizations using statistical and analytical methods and techniques of the applied social sciences to gain insight or support decision making.

Market research, marketing research, and marketing are a sequence of business activities; sometimes these are handled informally.

The field of &quot;marketing research&quot; is much older than that of &quot;market research&quot;. Although both involve consumers, Marketingresearch&quot; is concerned specifically about marketing processes, such as advertising effectiveness and salesforce effectiveness, while market research&quot; is concerned specifically with markets and distribution. Two explanations given for confusing &quot;Market research&quot; with &quot;Marketing research&quot; are the similarity of the terms and also that &quot;Market Research is a subset of Marketing Research&quot;. Further confusion exists because of major companies with expertise and practices in both areas.

==History==
Although &quot;market research&quot; started to be conceptualized and put into formal practice during the 1930s as an offshoot of the advertising boom of the Golden Age of radio in the United States, this was based on 1920s work by Daniel Starch. Starch &quot;developed a theory that advertising had to be seen, read, believed, remembered, and most importantly, acted upon, in order to be considered effective.&quot; Advertisers realized the significance of demographics by the patterns in which they sponsored different radio programs.

The Gallup Organization helped invent the public opinion poll; today, &quot;Market research is a way of paying for it.&quot;

==Market research for business/planning==
Market research is a way of getting an overview of consumers&#x27; wants, needs and beliefs. It can also involve discovering how they act. The research can be used to determine how a product could be marketed. Peter Drucker believed market research to be the quintessence of marketing.
Market research is a way that producers and the marketplace study the consumer and gather information about the consumers&#x27; needs.
There are two major types of market research: primary research, which is sub-divided into quantitative and qualitative research, and secondary research.

Factors that can be investigated through market research include:
*Market information: Through market information one can know the prices of different commodities in the market, as well as the supply and demand situation. Market researchers have a wider role than previously recognized by helping their clients to understand social, technical, and even legal aspects of markets.
*Market segmentation: Market segmentation is the division of the market or population into subgroups with similar motivations. It is widely used for segmenting on geographic differences, demographic differences (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.), technographic differences, psychographic differences, and differences in product use. For B2B segmentation firmographics is commonly used.
*Market trends: Market trends are the upward or downward movement of a market, during a period of time. Determining the market size may be more difficult if one is starting with a new innovation. In this case, you will have to derive the figures from the number of potential customers, or customer segments.
*SWOT analysis: SWOT is a written analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats to a business entity. A SWOT may also be written up for the competition to understand how to develop the marketing and product mixes. The SWOT method helps to determine and also reassess strategies and analyze a business&#x27;s processes.
*PEST analysis: PEST is an analysis about external environment . It includes a complete examine of a firm&#x27;s Political, Economical, Social and Technological external factors, which may impact firms&#x27; objectives or profitability. They may become a benefit for the firm or harm its productivity.
*Brand health tracker: Brand tracking is way of continuously measuring the health of a brand, both in terms of consumers&#x27; usage of it (i.e. Brand Funnel) and what they think about it. Brand health can be measured in a number of ways, such as brand awareness, brand equity, brand usage and brand loyalty.

Another factor that can be measured is marketing effectiveness. This includes:
==Data collection==

&quot;Rigorous sampling methodologies combined with high-quality data collection&quot; is what the magazine &quot;Advertising Age&quot; considers the backbone of market research. Data collection can be done by observing customer behavior through in-situ studies or by processing e.g. log files, by interviewing customers, potential customers, stakeholders, or a sample of the general population. The data can be quantitative in nature (counting sales, clicks, eye-tracking) or qualitative (surveys, questionnaires, interviews, feedback). Aggregating, visualizing, and turning data into actionable insights is one of the major challenges of market research and today, text analytics affords market researches methods to process large amounts of qualitative information and turn it into quantitative data, which is easier to visualize and use for formalized decision making. 

Data collection can use larger audience samples than the few hundred or thousand typically used in market research. Also required is the (at least passive) cooperation of those being surveyed; trust is also helpful. Translation is an essential comprehension tool for global consumers and is not a simple act of replacing words in one language with words in another.

Some data collection is incentivized: a simple form is when those on the road contribute to traffic reporting of which they are consumers. More complex is the relationship of consumer-to-business (C2B), which sometimes introduces reliability problems. Other data collection is to know more about the market, which is the purpose of market research.

==International influence from the Internet==
The international growth of available research both from and via the Internet has influenced a vast number of consumers and those from whom they make purchases. Although emerging global markets, such as China, Indonesia and Russia are still smaller than the US in B2B e-commerce, their internet-fueled growth factor is stimulated by product-enhancing websites, graphics, and content designed to attract corporate and consumer/B2C shoppers. Estimates for 2010 show between US$400 billion and $600 billion in revenue was generated by this medium.

A report titled &quot;Global B2C E-Commerce and Online Payment Market 2014&quot; indicated a decrease in overall growth rates in North America and Western Europe, even as absolute growth numbers rose.

The UK Market Research Society (MRS) listed the top social media platforms primarily used by millennials are LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

==Research and market sectors==
Regarding details for worldwide corporate market research, &quot;most of them are never written about because they are the consumer research done by the country&#x27;s manufacturers.&quot; Also less written about is tailored translation approaches based on the expertise or resources available in the local country. To mitigate implicit and unconscious bias in market research design, researchers have suggested conducting bias testing via interviewer-moderated technology-aided, unmoderated methods. 

Market research data has loss prevention aspects; that less than 60 percent of all proposed modifications and new products are deemed failures. When information about the market is difficult to acquire, and the cost of &quot;going ahead with the decision&quot; to offer the product or service is affordable, the research cost may be more profitably used &quot;to ensure that the new line got the advertising send-off it needed to have the best chances of succeeding.&quot; 

As measured in revenue, US based Amazon is the worldwide E-Commerce leader.

===Market research for the film industry===
The film industry is an example where the importance of testing film content and marketing material involves:
# Concept testing, which evaluates reactions to a film idea and is fairly rare;
# Positioning studios, which analyze a script for marketing opportunities;
# Focus groups, which probe viewers&#x27; opinions about a film in small groups prior to release;
# Test screenings, which involve the previewing of films prior to theatrical release;
# Tracking studies, which gauge (often by telephone polling) an audience&#x27;s awareness of a film on a weekly basis prior to and during theatrical release;
# Advertising testing, which measures responses to marketing materials such as trailers and television advertisements;
# Exit surveys, that measure audience reactions after seeing the film in the cinema.

==Insights industry==
Market research is an industry that overlaps with and is often referred to as the &quot;insights&quot; industry. However, the distinctive methods and techniques of market research not always correspond to the digital-first approach of insights vendors. The emergence of insights focusing on data analytics rather than fieldwork is competing with market research for managerial attention and funding. Current research with market research practitioners shows two pressing concerns for the industry: online data commoditization and the increasing distance between market researchers and top management within client organizations. Both concerns boil down to the risk they perceived of market research becoming a legacy activity of the marketing department rather than the cornerstone of business strategy.

Market research aims to produce so-called &quot;actionable knowledge&quot; that firms find useful in their operations:
# Framing managerial anomalies: an anomaly is a puzzle or a perplexing situation that the market research report is meant to solve.
# Loading instruments with meanings: translate observations of commonplace social practices into the marketing ontology.
# Signposting prescriptions: guide an intended reading to reduce interpretive flexibility.

==Small businesses and nonprofits==
Small organizations and non-profits can derive needed information by observing the environment of their location. Small scale surveys and focus groups are low cost ways to gather information from potential and existing customers and donors. While secondary data (statistics, demographics, etc.) is available to the public in libraries or on the internet, primary sources, done well, can be quite valuable: talking for an hour each, to twelve people, two apiece from six potential clients, can &quot;get inside their minds.. get a feel for their needs, wants and pain. You can&#x27;t get that from a questionnaire.&quot;
