<text>A rubber stamp is an image or pattern that has been carved, molded, laser engraved, or vulcanized onto a sheet of rubber. Rubber stamping, also called stamping, is a craft in which some type of ink made of dye or pigment is applied to a rubber stamp, and used to make decorative images on some media, such as paper or fabric.

==Description==

A rubber stamp uses a raised-relief image molded into a sheet of rubber, often mounted onto a more stable object such as a wood, brick, or an acrylic block. For compactness, the vulcanized rubber image with an adhesive foam backing may be attached to a cling vinyl sheet which allows it to be used with an acrylic handle for support. These cling rubber stamps can be stored in a smaller amount of space, and typically cost less than the wood-mounted versions. They can also be positioned with a greater amount of accuracy due to the stamper&#x27;s ability to see through the handle being used. 

The ink-coated rubber stamp is pressed onto any type of medium such that the colored image is transferred to the medium. The medium is generally some type of fabric or paper. Other media used are wood, metal, glass, plastic, and rock. High-volume batik uses liquid wax instead of ink, with a metal stamp.

There are three main types of rubber stamp inking technology: traditional stamps with a separate ink pad, self-inking stamps with a self-contained die that flips to make an imprint, and pre-inked stamps where the die material is impregnated with ink.

Commercially available rubber stamps are marketed in three categories: stationery stamps for use in the office, stamps used for decorating objects, or those used as children&#x27;s toys.

==Business rubber stamps==

Rubber stamps for business commonly show an address, corporate logo and business registration number. Some stamps also have movable parts that allow the user to adjust the date or the wording of the stamp. They are used to date incoming mail, as well as to denote special handling for documents. In some countries it is common practice for formal documents such as contracts to be rubber-stamped over the signature as additional evidence of authenticity. The objective is to authenticate the contracts, prevent forging, and increases efficiency as company executives do not have to separately sign individual company documents.

Business stamps are commonly obtained from stationery stores or directly from manufacturers. They encompass a variety of types, including address stamps, standard word stamps like &quot;received&quot; or &quot;payment due,&quot; and dater stamps. These stamps collectively account for nearly 30% of annual sales in the industry.

==Other applications==

Rubber stamps are used beyond the business and office world. Applications range from education to marking animals to the food and drinks industry. A few are listed below:

* Education stamps
* Dietary requirements on food packaging
* Stamping food, e.g. meats (with food grade ink, e.g. Noris 111 meat marking ink)
* Loyalty stamps, used to encourage repeat sales
* Arts and crafts, e.g. stamping impressions into soaps and clay
* Textiles
* Animal marking, e.g. pigeons before racing
* As travel-related collectables, e.g. Japanese &quot;eki&quot; stamps

==Automated &quot;rubber stamp&quot; images==
Document marking can be done from within the user&#x27;s word processor. This can be done manually by creating the &quot;stamps&quot; to appear on the documents in automated document marking software for Microsoft Word. This allows each page to be stamped as it is printed with the user-selected images created electronically.

==As an art form==


Materials besides rubber can produce a stamp. Woodcut and linocut, the carving of linoleum, are art forms based on the same principles. Linoleum is a harder material than rubber and requires additional pressure to carve. Woodcut is used by experienced artists, requiring both talent and patience. Rubber carving materials are often similar to that of linoleum and woodcut, such as sharp cutting heads, V and U tools Temporary stamps with simple designs can be carved from a potato or other semi-rigid food item.

Furthermore, photopolymer stamps are gaining popularity. They are most often produced in a set of coordinated images using a clear polymer material on an acetate carrier sheet for storage and packaging. The stamps are peeled from the carrier sheet and applied to a clear acrylic handle. This allows the stamper to view the image through the handle and effect precise placement of the image where desired. Photopolymer stamps are generally produced in the United States for sale domestically and internationally. Silicone stamps have many of the same properties of the photopolymer stamps. The creation of clear stamps facilitates the storage of a sizeable image collection, as they can all be used with a single set of handles of various sizes. They are also often very economical, being produced in sets of several images which work together to form a cohesive look.

Various methods can alter the appearance of carved stamps. Paints, pigments, and dye inks create different effects, extending the use of rubber stamping from paper to fabrics, wood, metal, glass, and so on. Ink pads can be purchased that allow for embossing, and there are markers that can be used to ink stamp pads with colors for a multi-color look. The use of rubber stamps can be combined with other materials. The image may be embellished by the addition of chalks, inks, paints, fibers, and a variety of other ephemera and embellishments.

Hand-carved rubber stamps find frequent use in mail art or artist trading cards, as they are typically small and allow the creation of a series of images. The TAM Rubber Stamp Archive has a collection of prints of rubber stamps mail-artists have used since 1983. Stamping is also often used in handmade cardmaking, scrapbooking, and letterboxing.

==Stamping communities==
Stamping has become a very popular home-based craft, and there are a number of forums, some with many thousands of members. Craft stampers tend to be associated with other paper crafts, such as card making and scrapbooking.

Periodical publications for the stamping community have included &quot;RubberStampMadness&quot;, &quot;Creative Stamping&quot;, &quot;Rubber Stamper&quot;, and &quot;The Stampers&#x27; Sampler Magazine&quot;. The latter two periodicals appear to have stopped publishing.

<doc id="232035" wikidata="Q529292" url="?curid=232035" title="Anencephaly">
<text>Anencephaly is the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp that occurs during embryonic development. It is a cephalic disorder that results from a neural tube defect that occurs when the rostral (head) end of the neural tube fails to close, usually between the 23rd and 26th day following conception. Strictly speaking, the Greek term translates as &quot;without a brain&quot; (or totally lacking the inside part of the head), but it is accepted that children born with this disorder usually only lack a telencephalon, the largest part of the brain consisting mainly of the cerebral hemispheres, including the neocortex, which is responsible for cognition. The remaining structure is usually covered only by a thin layer of membrane—skin, bone, meninges, etc., are all lacking. With very few exceptions, infants with this disorder do not survive longer than a few hours or days after birth.
==Signs and symptoms==
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) describes the presentation of this condition as follows: &quot;A baby born with anencephaly is usually blind, deaf, unaware of its surroundings and unable to feel pain. Although some individuals with anencephaly may be born with a main brain stem, the lack of a functioning cerebrum permanently rules out the possibility of ever gaining awareness of their surroundings. Reflex actions such as breathing and responses to sound or touch may occur.&quot;


==Causes==
Folic acid has been shown to be important in neural tube formation since at least 1991, and as a subtype of neural tube defect, folic acid may play a role in anencephaly. Studies have shown that the addition of folic acid to the diet of women of child-bearing age may significantly reduce, although not eliminate, the incidence of neural tube defects. Therefore, it is recommended that all women of child-bearing age consume 0.4 mg of folic acid daily, especially those attempting to conceive or who may possibly conceive, as this can reduce the risk to 0.03%. It is not advisable to wait until pregnancy has begun, since, by the time a woman knows she is pregnant, the critical time for the formation of a neural tube defect has usually already passed. A physician may prescribe even higher dosages of folic acid (5 mg/day) for women having had a previous pregnancy with a neural tube defect.

Neural tube defects can follow patterns of heredity, with direct evidence of autosomal recessive inheritance. As reported by Bruno Reversade and colleagues, the homozygous inactivation of the NUAK2 kinase leads to anencephaly in humans. Animal models indicate a possible association with deficiencies of the transcription factor TEAD2. A woman who has had one child with a neural tube defect such as anencephaly has about a 3% risk of having another child with a neural tube defect, as opposed to the background rate of 0.1% occurrence in the population at large. Genetic counseling is usually offered to women at a higher risk of having a child with a neural tube defect to discuss available testing.
It is known that people taking certain anticonvulsants and people with insulin-dependent diabetes have a higher risk of having a child with a neural tube defect.

=== Relation to genetic ciliopathy ===
Until recently, medical literature did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that are now being found to be related. As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying set of medical symptoms that are clinically visible in the disorders. Anencephaly is one such disease, part of an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell, organelles present in many cellular types throughout the human body. The cilia defects adversely affect &quot;numerous critical developmental signaling pathways&quot; essential to cellular development and, thus, offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases. Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alström syndrome, Meckel–Gruber syndrome, and some forms of retinal degeneration.

==Diagnosis==

Anencephaly can often be diagnosed before birth through an ultrasound examination. The maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP screening) and detailed fetal ultrasound can be useful for screening for neural tube defects such as spina bifida or anencephaly.

=== Meroanencephaly ===
Meroanencephaly is a rare form of anencephaly characterized by malformed cranial bones, a median cranial defect, and a cranial protrusion called area cerebrovasculosa. Area cerebrovasculosa is a section of abnormal, spongy, vascular tissue admixed with glial tissue ranging from simply a membrane to a large mass of connective tissue, hemorrhagic vascular channels, glial nodules, and disorganized choroid plexuses.

=== Holoanencephaly ===
The most common type of anencephaly, where the brain has entirely failed to form, except for the brain stem. Infants rarely survive more than one day after birth with holoanencephaly.

=== Craniorachischisis ===

The most severe type of anencephaly where area cerebrovasculosa and area medullovasculosa fill both cranial defects and the spinal column. Craniorachischisis is characterized by anencephaly accompanied by bony defects in the spine and the exposure of neural tissue as the vault of the skull fails to form. Craniorachischisis occurs in about 1 of every 1000 live births, but various physical and chemical tests can detect neural tube closure during early pregnancy.

==Prognosis==
There is no cure or standard treatment for anencephaly. Prognosis is extremely poor, as many anencephalic fetuses do not survive birth and infants that are not stillborn will usually die within a few hours or days after birth from cardiorespiratory arrest.

==Epidemiology==
In the United States, anencephaly occurs in about 1 out of every 4600 births. Rates may be higher among Africans with rates in Nigeria estimated at 3 per 10,000 in 1990 while rates in Ghana estimated at 8 per 10,000 in 1992. As of 2005, rates in China were estimated at 5 per 10,000.

A high anencephaly rate of 19.7 per 10,000 live births was found in 1990/1991 in Brownsville, Texas. A cluster of cases made national headlines and prompted a public health investigation and the Texas Neural Tube Defect Project. It was found, that neural tube defects in general, including spina bifida, and encephalocele had been occurring in Mexican-American women undetected for years in the area. Subsequently, multiple risk factors were found, foremost folic acid deficiency, low serum vitamin B12, high serum homocysteine levels, and obesity independently contributed to risk. Increasing dietary folate intake had a protective effect.

Research has suggested that, overall, female babies are more likely to be affected by the disorder.

== Ethical issues ==

=== Organ donation ===
One issue concerning anencephalic newborns is organ donation. Initial legal guidance came from the case of Baby Theresa in 1992, in which the boundaries of organ donation were tested for the first time. Infant organs are scarce, and the high demand for pediatric organ transplants poses a major public health issue. In 1999, it was found that for American children under the age of two who are waiting for a transplant, 30–50% die before an organ becomes available.

Within the medical community, the main ethical issues with organ donation are a misdiagnosis of anencephaly, the slippery slope argument, that anencephalic neonates would rarely be a source of organs, and that it would undermine confidence in organ transplantation. Slippery slope concerns are a major issue in personhood debates, across the board. In regards to anencephaly, those who oppose organ donation argue that it could open the door for involuntary organ donors such as an elderly person with severe dementia. Another point of contention is the number of children who would actually benefit. There are discrepancies in statistics; however, it is known that most anencephalic children are stillborn.

Proposals have been made to bypass the legal and ethical issues surrounding organ donation. These include waiting for death to occur before procuring organs, expanding the definition of death, creating a special legal category for anencephalic infants, and defining them as non-persons.

In the United Kingdom, a child born with anencephaly was reported as the country&#x27;s youngest organ donor. Teddy Houlston was diagnosed as anencephalic at 12 weeks of gestation. His parents, Jess Evans and Mike Houlston, decided against abortion and instead proposed organ donation. Teddy was born on 22 April 2014, in Cardiff, Wales, and lived for 100 minutes, after which his heart and kidneys were removed. His kidneys were later transplanted into an adult in Leeds. Teddy&#x27;s twin, Noah, was born healthy.

=== Brain death ===
There are four different concepts used to determine brain death: failure of heart, failure of lungs, whole brain death, and neocortical death.

Neocortical death, similar to a persistent vegetative state (PVS), involves loss of cognitive functioning of the brain. A proposal by law professor David Randolph Smith, in an attempt to prove that neocortical death should legally be treated the same as brain death, involved PET scans to determine the similarities. However, this proposal has been criticized on the basis that confirming neocortical death by PET scan may risk indeterminacy.

=== Pregnancy termination ===
Anencephaly can be diagnosed before delivery with a high degree of accuracy. Although anencephaly is a fatal condition, the option of abortion is dependent on the abortion laws in the jurisdiction. According to a 2013 report, 26% of the world&#x27;s population reside in a country where abortion is generally prohibited. In 2012, Brazil extended the right of abortion to mothers with anencephalic fetuses. This decision, however, received vocal disapproval from several religious groups.

=== Legal proceedings ===

The case of baby Theresa was the beginning of the ethical debate over anencephalic infant organ donation. The story of baby Theresa remains a focus of basic moral philosophy. Baby Theresa was born with anencephaly in 1992. Her parents, knowing that their child was going to die, requested that her organs be given for transplantation. Although her physicians agreed, Florida law prohibited the infant&#x27;s organs from being removed while she was still alive. By the time she died nine days after birth, her organs had deteriorated past the point of being viable.

==== United States uniform acts ====
The Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) is a model bill, adopted by many US states, stating that an individual who has sustained either 1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or 2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead. This bill was a result of much debate over the definition of death and is applicable to the debate over anencephaly. A related bill, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), grants individuals and, after death, their family members the right to decide whether or not to donate organs. Because it is against the law for any person to pay money for an organ, the person in need of an organ transplant must rely on a volunteer.

There have been two state bills that proposed to change current laws regarding death and organ donation. California Senate Bill 2018 proposed to amend the UDDA to define anencephalic infants as already dead, while New Jersey Assembly Bill 3367 proposed to allow anencephalic infants to be organ sources even if they are not dead.

==Research==

Some genetic research has been conducted to determine the causes of anencephaly. It has been found that cartilage homeoprotein (CART1) is selectively expressed in chondrocytes (cartilage cells). The CART1 gene to chromosome 12q21.3–q22 has been mapped. Also, it has been found that mice homozygous for deficiency in the Cart1 gene manifested acrania and meroanencephaly, and prenatal treatment with folic acid will suppress acrania and meroanencephaly in the Cart1-deficient mutants.

<text>Nobina Sverige AB, former Swebus AB, is the largest bus operator in Sweden, with 5,277 employees, 2,241 buses and net sales of 5,138 million SEK. It was owned by the Swedish State Railways until October 1996, when it was sold to Stagecoach Group, and then later, in January 2000, to Concordia Bus.

==History==
Swebus AB was officially formed on 1 January 1990, when all bus operations of the Swedish State Railways (SJ) were merged to one company. This included &quot;SJ Buss&quot; and &quot;GDG Biltrafikk AB&quot;, owned through SJ&#x27;s subsidiary Swedcarrier AB. The history of SJ&#x27;s bus operations date back to 1911, while GDG dates back to 1932. However, the companies operated like before for some months, and GDG became Swebus from 1 May, while SJ Buss joined on 1 November. The two subsidiaries &quot;Swebus Inrikes AB&quot; (&quot;domestic&quot;) and Swebus Utrikes AB (&quot;foreign&quot;) were formed.

On 1 July 1991, &quot;Postens Diligenstrafik&quot;, the Swedish postal service&#x27;s own bus operator was also incorporated. This operator had many brucks for carrying mail in rural parts of Sweden.

In 1994, Swebus expanded their activities to Finland by acquiring Finnish operator &quot;HPT-TransBus Oy&quot;, which changed name to Oy Swebus Finland Ab on 25 January 1995. Another Finnish bus operator, &quot;Oy Espoon Auto Ab&quot;, was acquired in 1995 and was later merged into Swebus Finland.

On 9 June 1994, the Swedish government stated that SJ should concentrate their business to only railway traffic, thus selling out any non-related companies like Swebus, and on 2 October 1996, Swebus was sold to Stagecoach. The management of all foreign operations were transferred to Stagecoach, and on 14 April 1998, the Finnish subsidiary changed name to &quot;Stagecoach Finland Oy Ab&quot;.

In April 1997, the long-distance coach service Swebus Express was started with traffic in several of Swebus&#x27; route areas. The name had first been used in the 1980s, and had also been loosely used on the long-distance routes prior to 1997, but under Stagecoach&#x27;s ownership it was developed to a commercial product. The Swebus Express division was later made into a separate subsidiary.

On 27 October 1999, Stagecoach announced that they would sell Swebus to Norwegian-American bus transport group Concordia Bus, with the transaction completed in January 2000.

When the Concordia Bus group changed name to Nobina 1 December 2009, Swebus was also renamed to &quot;Nobina Sverige AB&quot;.

===Swebus Danmark===
In 1993, &quot;Swebus Danmark A/S&quot; was established as a Danish subsidiary. In January 1995, &quot;Sechers Rutebiler A/S&quot; and &quot;Dania Tours A/S&quot; in Rostved near Rønde, and in March also &quot;Fabers Buslinjer A/S&quot; in Randers, all in the Central Jutland Region, were acquired and started trading as &quot;Dania Bustrafik&quot;. Swebus Danmark also won a contract in North Zealand with base in Hørsholm, which started on 1 June 1996. After the Stagecoach takeover, all of Swebus&#x27; operations in Denmark were sold to former Danish State Railways (DSB) bus division Combus A/S in autumn of 1997.

===Swebus Norge===
In an effort to enter the market in Norway&#x27;s capital Oslo, Swebus made a letter of intent with Oslo Sporveier to buy a 48% share in their bus division Sporveisbussene in the autumn of 1994, but the agreement was never realised. In 1995, Swebus Norge AS was established, and in a different strategy to gain access in the Norwegian market, they acquired bus operators &quot;Vestoppland Bilselskap AS&quot; in Gjøvik in February and &quot;Litra Buss AS&quot; in Lillehammer and &quot;Hamar og Omland Bilruter AS&quot; (HOB) in Hamar in October. As the three cities surround lake Mjøsa, Norway&#x27;s largest freshwater lake, they were all renamed &quot;Mjøsbuss AS&quot;, with a logo and livery similar to that of Swebus. Mjøsbuss had a total of 270 buses in its fleet. In a new Stagecoach-led attempt to gain traffic in Oslo, they bid for &quot;Oslo og Follo Busstrafikk AS&quot; (OFB), one of the major bus operators in the Oslo area, but they lost the competition to Norgesbuss. Also a bid for &quot;Bærums Forenede Bilruter AS&quot; (BFB) was lost to Norgesbuss. Stagecoach had no further interest in the Norwegian market outside Oslo, and all operations in Norway were sold to Norgesbuss on 30 April 1997.

<text>Colpocephaly is a cephalic disorder involving the disproportionate enlargement of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles and is usually diagnosed early after birth due to seizures. It is a nonspecific finding and is associated with multiple neurological syndromes, including agenesis of the corpus callosum, Chiari malformation, lissencephaly, and microcephaly. Although the exact cause of colpocephaly is not known yet, it is commonly believed to occur as a result of neuronal migration disorders during early brain development, intrauterine disturbances, perinatal injuries, and other central nervous system disorders. Individuals with colpocephaly have various degrees of motor disabilities, visual defects, spasticity, and moderate to severe intellectual disability.
No specific treatment for colpocephaly exists, but patients may undergo certain treatments to improve their motor function or intellectual disability.

== Symptoms ==
There are various symptoms of colpocephaly and patients can experience effects ranging from mild to severe. Some patients do not show most of the symptoms related to colpocephaly, such as psychomotor abnormalities and agenesis of the corpus callosum. In some cases, signs appear later on in life and a significant number of children only develop minor disabilities.
The following list includes common symptoms of colpocephaly.

* partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum
* intellectual disability
* motor abnormalities
* visual defects such as, crossing of the eyes, missing visual fields, and optic nerve hypoplasia
* spasticity
* seizures
* cerebral palsy

Intracranial abnormalities include:

* Microcephaly
* Agenesis of the corpus callosum
* Meningomyelocele
* Lissencephaly
* Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)
* Enlargement of the cisterna magna
* Cerebellar hypoplasia

== Causes ==
There is no known definitive single mechanism that causes colpocephaly. However, researchers believe there are many possible causes of colpocephaly. It is a common symptom of other neurological disorders in newborns, can be caused as a result of shunt treatment of hydrocephalus, developmental disorders in premature infants, due to intrauterine disturbances during pregnancy, genetic disorders, underdevelopment or lack of white matter in the cerebrum, and exposure of the mother and the developing fetus to medications, infections, radiation, or toxic substances. Also, it is usually more common in premature infants than in full-term infants, especially in babies born with hypoxia or lung immaturity.

Some of the central nervous system disorders which are associated with colpocephaly are as follows:
* polymicrogyria
* Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)
* intraventricular hemorrhage
* Hydrocephalus
* schizencephaly
* microgyria
* microcephaly
* Pierre-Robin syndrome
* Neurofibromatosis

Often colpocephaly occurs as a result of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles or in the subarachnoid space over the brain. The increased pressure due to this condition dilates occipital horns causing colpocephaly.

The most generally accepted theory is that of neuronal migration disorders occurring during the second to fifth months of fetal life. Neuronal migration disorders are caused by abnormal migration, proliferation, and organization of neurons during early brain development. During the seventh week of gestation, neurons start proliferating in the germinal matrix which is located in the subependymal layer of the walls of the lateral ventricles. During the eighth week of gestation, the neurons then start migrating from the germinal zone to cortex along specialized radial glial fibers. Next, neurons organize themselves into layers and form synaptic contacts with other neurons present in the cortex. Under normal conditions, the neurons forming a germinal layer around ventricles migrate to the surface of the brain and form the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. If this process is abnormal or disturbed it could result in the enlargement of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles. Common prenatal disturbances that have been shown to disturb the neuronal migration process include the following:

* continuation of oral contraceptives
* exposure to alcohol
* intrauterine malnutrition
* intrauterine infections such as toxoplasmosis
* maternal drug ingestion during early pregnancy such as corticosteroids, salbutamol, and theophylline
Researchers also believe that these factors can cause destruction of neural elements that have previously been normally formed.

It is suggested that the underdevelopment or lack of white matter in the developing fetus could be a cause of colpocephaly. The partial or complete absence of white matter, also known as agenesis of the corpus callosum results in anatomic malformations that can lead to colpocephaly. This starts to occur around the middle of the second month to the fifth month of pregnancy. The lateral ventricles are formed as large cavities of the telencephalic vesicle. The size of the ventricles are decreased in normal development after the formation of the Foramen of Magendie, which decompresses the ventricular cavities. Myelination of the ventricular walls and association fibers of the corpus callosum and the calcarine fissure helps shape the occipital horns. In cases where this developmental process is interrupted, occipital horns are disproportionately enlarged.

Colpocephaly has been associated with chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 8 mosaic and trisomy 9 mosaic. A few reports of genetically transmitted colpocephaly are also found in literature. Some of these are of two siblings, monozygotic twins, and non-identical twins. The authors suggest a genetic origin with an autosomal or X-linked recessive inheritance rather than resulting from early prenatal disturbances.

== Diagnosis ==

===Presentation===
Colpocephaly is characterized by disproportionately large occipital horns of the lateral ventricles (also frontal and temporal ventricles in some cases). MRI and CT scans of patients demonstrate abnormally thick gray matter with thin poorly myelinated white matter. This happens as a result of partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum. Corpus callosum is the band of white matter connecting the two cerebral hemispheres. The corpus callosum plays an extremely important role in interhemispheric communication, thus lack of or absence of these neural fibers results in a number of disabilities.

The lemon sign on CT scans of patients refers to the shape of the fetal skull when the frontal bones lose their normal convex contour and appear flattened or inwardly scalloped. This gives the skull a shape similar to that of a lemon. The sign is seen on transverse sonograms of the fetal cranium obtained at the level of the ventricles.
A special case is found in literature where lissencephaly, colpocephaly, and septal agenesis are all present together. The CT scans of the patient shows the ventricular system having a unique appearance of a crown of a king. This is referred to as the &#x27;CROWN SIGN&#x27;.

=== Prenatal ===
Diagnosing colpocephaly prenatally is difficult because in many cases signs start to appear after birth. Prenatal diagnosis is made by detecting enlargement of either or both occipital horns of the lateral ventricles. Usually prenatal ultrasounds don&#x27;t show cephalic abnormalities and in cases that they do show abnormality is of low accuracy, making it difficult to diagnose colpocephaly. Often, abnormalities in prenatal ultrasounds can be misdiagnosed as hydrocephalus.

=== Postnatal ===
After birth, MR imaging can be done to look for cephalic abnormalities. This is the most commonly used method for diagnosing colpocephaly. Physicians look for abnormally large occipital horns of the lateral ventricles and diminished thickness of white matter. Spinal tapping is not a preferred method for diagnosis because newborn babies with colpocephaly or hydrocephaly have open fontanelles which makes it difficult to collect CSF. Also, colpocephaly is not associated with increased pressure.

== Treatment ==
Colpocephaly is usually non-fatal. There has been relatively little research conducted to improve treatments for colpocephaly, and there is no known definitive treatment of colpocephaly yet. Specific treatment depends on associated symptoms and the degree of dysfunction. Anticonvulsant medications can be given to prevent seizure complications, and physical therapy is used to prevent contractures (shrinkage or shortening of muscles) in patients that have limited mobility. Patients can also undergo surgeries for stiff joints to improve motor function. The prognosis for individuals with colpocephaly depends on the severity of the associated conditions and the degree of abnormal brain development.

A rare case of colpocephaly is described in literature which is associated with macrocephaly instead of microcephaly. Increased intracranial pressure was also found in the condition. Similar symptoms (absence of corpus callosum and increased head circumference) were noted as in the case of colpocephaly that is associated with microcephaly. A bi-ventricular peritoneal shunt was performed, which greatly improved the symptoms of the condition. Ventriculo-peritoneal shunts are used to drain the fluid into the peritoneal cavity.

== History ==
These brain abnormalities were first described by Benda in 1940 as &#x27;vesiculocephaly&#x27;. In 1946, Yakovlev and Wadsworth coined the term colpocephaly from the Greek word &quot;kolpos&quot; (hollow) and &quot;kephalos&quot; (head). It was suggested that the enlargement of ventricles occurred as a result of white matter development arrest during early fetal life. They stated that &quot;in the apparent dilatation of the occipital horns...it represented a failure of development of the cerebral wall with persistence of the embryonal vesicular character of the brain.&quot; Yakovlev meant for this term to apply to the result of disturbances during the development of the brain. He suggested the term &#x27;hydrocephalus ex vauco&#x27; to be used for enlargement of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles as a result of damage to the brain after it is normally formed. However, today the term colpocephaly is used to describe both the situations.

== Future Research ==
Stem cell therapy is considered a very promising treatment for patients with colpocephaly. Oligodendroglial cells can be used which will increase the production of myelin and alleviate symptoms of colpocephaly. Damage to the developing oligodendrocytes near the cerebral ventricles causes cerebral palsy as well as other demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies. Demyelination reduces the speed of conduction in affected nerves resulting in disabilities in cognition, sensation, and motor. Therefore, by using oligodendrocyte stem cells the effects of cerebral palsy can be treated and other symptoms of colpocephaly can be alleviated.

<doc id="232039" wikidata="Q1459821" url="?curid=232039" title="Holoprosencephaly">
<text>Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a cephalic disorder in which the prosencephalon (the forebrain of the embryo) fails to develop into two hemispheres, typically occurring between the 18th and 28th day of gestation. Normally, the forebrain is formed and the face begins to develop in the fifth and sixth weeks of human pregnancy. The condition also occurs in other species.

Holoprosencephaly is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in every 250 conceptions and most cases are not compatible with life and result in fetal death in utero due to deformities to the skull and brain. However, holoprosencephaly is still estimated to occur in approximately 1 in every 8,000 live births.

When the embryo&#x27;s forebrain does not divide to form bilateral cerebral hemispheres (the left and right halves of the brain), it causes defects in the development of the face and in brain structure and function.

The severity of holoprosencephaly is highly variable. In less severe cases, babies are born with normal or near-normal brain development and facial deformities that may affect the eyes, nose, and upper lip.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of holoprosencephaly range from mild (no facial/organ defects, anosmia, or only a single central incisor) to severe (cyclopia). The symptoms are dependent upon the classification type.

There are four classifications of holoprosencephaly, as well as a mild &quot;microform&quot; variant.

; Alobar
: The most severe form of holoprosencephaly, this includes formation of synophthalmia (a single central eye), proboscis, and severe impairment.
; Semilobar
: Can present with severely decreased distance between eyes, a flat nasal bridge, eye defects, cleft lip and palate, and severe impairment.
; Lobar
: Can present with decreased distance between eyes, a flat nasal bridge, and closely spaced nostrils. Mental and locomotion delays may also be present.
; Syntelencephaly or middle interhemispheric variant of holoprosencephaly (MIHV)
: Mild phenotypic presentation which can present with flat nasal bridge, metopic prominence, shallow philtrum, and possible mental and locomotion delays.
; Microform
: Mild phenotypic presentation with reduced distance between eyes, sharp nasal bridge, single maxillary central incisor.

== Diagnosis ==
Holoprosencephaly is typically diagnosed during fetal development when there are abnormalities found on fetal brain imaging, but it can also be diagnosed after birth. The protocol for diagnosis includes neuroimaging (Ultrasound or fetal MRI prior to birth or Ultrasound, MRI or CT post birth), syndrome evaluation, cytogenetics, molecular testing, and genetic counseling.

There are four classifications of holoprosencephaly as well as a “microform&quot;. These classifications can be distinguished by their anatomical differences.

* Alobar holoprosencephaly
** Small single forebrain ventricle 
** No interhemispheric division 
** Absence of olfactory bulbs and tracts
** Absence of corpus callosum
** Non separation of deep gray nuclei
* Semilobar holoprosencephaly
** Rudimentary cerebral lobes
** Incomplete interhemispheric division 
** Absence or hypoplasia of olfactory bulbs and tracts 
** Absence of corpus callosum
** Varying non separation of deep gray nuclei
* Lobar holoprosencephaly
** Fully-developed cerebral lobes
** Distinct interhemispheric division 
** Midline continuous frontal neocortex
** Absent, hypoplasic or normal corpus callosum
** Separation of deep gray nuclei
* Syntelencephaly, or middle interhemispheric variant of holoprosencephaly (MIHV)
** Failure of separation of the posterior frontal and parietal lobes
** Callosal genu and splenium normally formed 
** Absence of corpus callosum
** Hypothalamus and lentiform nuclei normally separated 
** Heterotopic gray matter
* Microform 
** Subtle defects of corpus callosum
** Subtle midline brain defects

== Causes ==
In holoprosencephaly, the neural tube fails to segment, resulting in incomplete separation of the prosencephalon at the fifth week of gestation. According to one hypothesis, the holoprosencephalic brain is due to an incomplete axial twisting. According to the axial twist theory, each side of the brain represents its opposite body side because the anterior part of the head, including the forebrain, is turned around by a twisting along the body axis during early development. Accordingly, holoprosencephaly is possibly an extreme form of Yakovlevian torque.

The exact cause(s) of HPE are yet to be determined. Mutations in the gene encoding the SHH protein, which is involved in the development of the central nervous system (CNS), can cause holoprosencephaly. In other cases, it often seems that there is no specific cause at all.

=== Genetics ===
Armand Marie Leroi describes the cause of cyclopia as a genetic malfunctioning during the process by which the embryonic brain is divided into two. Only later does the visual cortex take recognizable form, and at this point an individual with a single forebrain region will be likely to have a single, possibly rather large, eye (at such a time, individuals with separate cerebral hemispheres would form two eyes).

Increases in expression of such genes as Pax-2, as well as inhibition of Pax-6, from the notochord have been implicated in normal differentiation of cephalic midline structures. Inappropriate expression of any of these genes may result in mild to severe forms of holoprosencephaly. Other candidate genes have been located, including the SHH (holoprosencephaly type 3 a.k.a. HPE3), TGIF1, ZIC2, SIX3 and BOC genes.

Although many children with holoprosencephaly have normal chromosomes, specific chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in some patients (trisomy of chromosome 13, also known as Patau syndrome). There is evidence that in some families, HPE is inherited (autosomal dominant as well as autosomal or X-linked recessive inheritance). Features consistent with familial transmission of the disease (e.g., a single central maxillary incisor) should be carefully assessed in parents and family members.

=== Non-genetic factors ===
Numerous possible risk factors have been identified, including gestational diabetes, transplacental infections (the &quot;TORCH complex&quot;), first trimester bleeding, and a history of miscarriage. As well, the disorder is found twice as often in female babies. However, there appears to be no correlation between HPE and maternal age.

There is evidence of a correlation between HPE and the use of various drugs classified as being potentially unsafe for pregnant and lactating mothers. These include insulin, birth control pills, aspirin, lithium, thorazine, retinoic acid, and anticonvulsants. There is also a correlation between alcohol consumption and HPE, along with nicotine, the toxins in cigarettes and toxins in cigarette smoke when used during pregnancy.

== Prognosis ==
HPE is not a condition in which the brain deteriorates over time. Although serious seizure disorders, autonomic dysfunction, complicated endocrine disorders and other life-threatening conditions may sometimes be associated with HPE, the mere presence of HPE does not mean that these serious problems will occur or develop over time without any previous indication or warning. These abnormalities are usually recognized shortly after birth or early in life and only occur if areas of the brain controlling those functions are fused, malformed or absent.

Prognosis is dependent upon the degree of fusion and malformation of the brain, as well as other health complications that may be present.

The more severe forms of encephalopathy are usually fatal. This disorder consists of a spectrum of defects, malformations and associated abnormalities. Disability is based upon the degree in which the brain is affected. Moderate to severe defects may cause intellectual disability, spastic quadriparesis, athetoid movements, endocrine disorders, epilepsy and other serious conditions; mild brain defects may only cause learning or behavior problems with few motor impairments.

Seizures may develop over time with the highest risk before 2 years of age and the onset of puberty. Most are managed with one medication or a combination of medications. Typically, seizures that are difficult to control appear soon after birth, requiring more aggressive medication combinations/doses.

Most children with HPE are at risk of having elevated blood sodium levels during moderate-severe illnesses that alter fluid intake/output, even if they have no previous diagnosis of diabetes insipidus or hypernatremia.

<text>Ethmocephaly is a type of cephalic disorder caused by holoprosencephaly. Ethmocephaly is the rarest phenotypic variant of a group of defects called the holoprosencephaly (HPE) malformation sequence; other variants include cebocephaly, cyclopia, and median cleft palate. It consists of a proboscis separating narrow-set eyes with an absent nose and microphthalmia (abnormal smallness of one or both eyes). Cebocephaly, another facial anomaly, is characterized by a small, flattened nose with a single nostril situated below incomplete or underdeveloped closely set eyes. 

The least severe in the spectrum of facial anomalies is the median cleft lip, also called premaxillary agenesis.

Although the causes of most cases of holoprosencephaly remain unknown, some may be due to dominant or chromosome causes. Such chromosomal anomalies as trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 have been found in association with holoprosencephaly, or other neural tube defects. Genetic counseling and genetic testing, such as amniocentesis, is usually offered during a pregnancy if holoprosencephaly is detected. The recurrence risk depends on the underlying cause. If no cause is identified and the fetal chromosomes are normal, the chance to have another pregnancy affected with holoprosencephaly is about 6%.

There is no treatment for holoprosencephaly and the prognosis for individuals with the disorder is poor. Most of those who survive show no significant developmental gains. For children who survive, treatment is symptomatic. It is possible that improved management of diabetic pregnancies may help prevent holoprosencephaly, however there is no means of primary prevention.

<text>Cebocephaly (from Greek &quot;kebos&quot;, &quot;monkey&quot; + &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;) is a developmental anomaly that is part of a group of defects called holoprosencephaly. Cebocephaly involves the presence of two separate eyes set close together and a small, flat nose with a single nostril (no nasal septum). It may be diagnosed before or after birth. It has a very poor prognosis, with most affected infants dying soon after birth. It is very rare, having been estimated to affect around 1 in 40,000 deliveries.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Cebocephaly causes:

* two separate eyes set close together
* a small, flat nose with a single nostril
* ear abnormalities
* mouth abnormalities (such as microstomia)

The presence of a nasal septum precludes a diagnosis of cebocephaly. Cebocephaly may cause malformations of the sphenoid and ethmoid bones behind the orbit.

== Cause ==
Cebocephaly can be caused by many factors, particularly genetic variations. These include 18p-, 14q deletion, 13q deletion, and some vertically transmitted infections. It is part of a group of defects called holoprosencephaly.

== Diagnosis ==
Before birth, cebocephaly may sometimes be diagnosed using ultrasound. After birth, cebocephaly is diagnosed based on the characteristic symptoms. A CT scan may be used to confirm the diagnosis.

== Prognosis ==
Most infants born with cebocephaly die soon after birth.

== Epidemiology ==
Cebocephaly is very uncommon. Some estimates of its prevalence include 1 in 40,000 neonatal deliveries.

== History ==
The word &quot;cebocephaly&quot; is derived from Greek &quot;kebos&quot; (monkey), and &quot;kephale&quot; (head).

<text>Hydranencephaly is a condition in which the brain&#x27;s cerebral hemispheres are absent to a great degree and the remaining cranial cavity is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.

Hydranencephaly is a type of cephalic disorder. These disorders are congenital conditions that derive from damage to, or abnormal development of, the fetal nervous system in the earliest stages of development in utero. These conditions do not have any definitive identifiable cause factor. Instead, they are generally attributed to a variety of hereditary or genetic conditions, but also by environmental factors such as maternal infection, pharmaceutical intake, or even exposure to high levels of radiation.

Hydranencephaly should not be confused with hydrocephalus, which is an accumulation of excess cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain.

In hemihydranencephaly, only half of the cranial cavity is affected.

==Signs and symptoms==
An infant with hydranencephaly may appear normal at birth or may have some distortion of the skull and upper facial features due to fluid pressure inside the skull. The infant&#x27;s head size and spontaneous reflexes such as sucking, swallowing, crying, and moving the arms and legs may all seem normal, depending on the severity of the condition. However, after a few weeks the infant sometimes becomes irritable and has increased muscle tone (hypertonia). After several months of life, seizures and hydrocephalus may develop, if they did not exist at birth. Other symptoms may include visual impairment, lack of growth, deafness, blindness, spastic quadriparesis (paralysis), and intellectual deficits.

Some infants may have additional abnormalities at birth including seizures, myoclonus (involuntary sudden, rapid jerks), limited thermoregulation abilities, and respiratory problems. Still other infants display no obvious symptoms at birth, going many months without a confirmed diagnosis of hydranencephaly. In some cases severe hydrocephalus, or another cephalic condition, is misdiagnosed.

==Causes==
Hydranencephaly is an extreme form of porencephaly, which is characterized by a cyst or cavity in the cerebral hemispheres.

Although the exact cause of hydranencephaly remains undetermined in most cases, the most likely general cause is by vascular insult, such as stroke, injury, intrauterine infections, or traumatic disorders after the first trimester of pregnancy. In a number of cases where intrauterine infection was determined to be the causing factor, most involved toxoplasmosis and viral infections such as enterovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, and syncytial viruses. Another cause factor is monochorionic twin pregnancies, involving the death of one twin in the second trimester, which in turn causes vascular exchange to the living twin through placental circulation through twin-to-twin transfusion, causing hydranencephaly in the surviving fetus. One medical journal reports hydranencephaly as an autosomal inherited disorder with an unknown mode of transmission, causing a blockage of the carotid artery where it enters the cranium; this causes obstruction and damage to the cerebral cortex.

===Post-natal brain injury===
Though hydranencephaly is typically a congenital disorder, it can occur as a postnatal diagnosis in the aftermath of meningitis, intracerebral infarction, ischemia, or a traumatic brain injury.

==Diagnosis==
An accurate, confirmed diagnosis is generally impossible until after birth, though prenatal diagnosis using fetal ultrasonography (ultrasound) can identify characteristic physical abnormalities. After birth, diagnosis may be delayed for several months because the infant&#x27;s early behavior appears to be relatively normal. The most accurate diagnostic techniques are thorough clinical evaluation (considering physical findings and a detailed patient history); advanced imaging techniques, such as angiography, computerized tomography (CT scan), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and (more rarely) transillumination. However, diagnostic literature fails to provide a clear distinction between severe obstructive hydrocephalus and hydranencephaly, leaving some children with an unsettled diagnosis.

Preliminary diagnosis may be made in utero via standard ultrasound, and can be confirmed with a standard anatomy ultrasound. Hydranencephaly is sometimes misdiagnosed as bilaterally symmetric schizencephaly (a less destructive developmental process on the brain), severe hydrocephalus (cerebrospinal fluid excess within the skull), or alobar holoprosencephaly (a neurological developmental anomaly).

Once destruction of the brain is complete, the cerebellum, midbrain, thalami, basal ganglia, choroid plexus, and portions of the occipital lobes typically remain preserved to varying degrees. The cerebral cortex is absent; however, in most cases, the fetal head remains enlarged due to increased intracranial pressure, which results from inadequate reabsorption of the cerebrospinal fluid produced in the choroid plexus.

==Prognosis==
There is no standard treatment for hydranencephaly. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. An accompanying diagnosis of hydrocephalus may be treated with surgical insertion of a shunt; this often improves prognosis and quality of life.

The prognosis for children with hydranencephaly is generally quite poor. Death often occurs within the first year of life, though many children live several years, or even into adulthood; in one reported case, a woman with hydranencephaly was assessed at age 32.
==Occurrence==
This condition affects under 1 in 10,000 births worldwide. Hydranencephaly is a rare disorder in the United States, which is defined as affecting fewer than 1 in 250,000.

<doc id="232047" wikidata="Q3315335" url="?curid=232047" title="Iniencephaly">
<text>Iniencephaly is a rare type of cephalic disorder characterised by three common characteristics: a defect to the occipital bone, spina bifida of the cervical vertebrae and retroflexion (backward bending) of the head on the cervical spine. Stillbirth is the most common outcome, with a few rare examples of live birth, after which death invariably occurs within a short time.

The disorder was first described by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1836. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek word ἰνίον &quot;inion&quot;, for the occipital bone/nape of the neck.

==Classifications==

There are two types of iniencephaly. The more severe group is iniencephaly apertus (open iniencephaly), involving the development of an encephalocele. In the other group, iniencephaly clausus (closed iniencephaly), the encephalocele is absent.

==Signs and symptoms==

The affected infant tends to be short, with a disproportionately large head. The fetal head of infants born with iniencephaly are hyperextended while the foramen magnum is enlarged and opens through the widened pedicles. The defective neural arches directly into the upper cervical reach of the spinal canal, causing the formation of a common cavity between most of the spinal cord and the brain. The skin of the anterior chest is connected directly to the face, bypassing the formation of a neck, while the scalp is directly connected to the skin of the back. Because of this, those born with this anomaly either have a highly shortened neck or no neck at all. This causes extreme retroflexion, or backward bending, of the head in a &quot;star-gazing&quot; fashion. The spine is severely distorted as well along with significant shortening due to marked lordosis. The vertebrae, especially cervical, are fused together in abnormal shapes and their numbers are reduced. The spinal cord is almost always defective while the ventricular system is often dilated and the cortex is thinned. Sometimes, in the case of iniencephaly apertus, an encephalocele (sac-like protrusions of the brain through an opening in the cranium) forms.

===Additional symptoms===

Additional symptoms include:

==Causes==

Though the iniencephaly is not genetic with its cause unknown, studies have shown that there are certain factors that can increase the risk of mothers giving birth to children with these anomalies.

===Chromosomal abnormalities===

Abnormalities in chromosomes such as trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and monosomy X have been shown to be tied to this disorder.

===Environmental factors===

Mothers with poor socioeconomic conditions, poor nutrition, low parity, and lack of folic acid supplementation, and/or hyperhomocysteinemia have shown to be at larger risk.

===Drugs===

Animal studies have shown that administration of the drugs vinblastine, streptonigrin, triparano, sulfonamide, tetracycline, antihistamines, and antitumor agents to pregnant mothers have resulted in offspring born with iniencephaly. The drug clomiphene, a drug commonly used for ovulation stimulation in fertility treatments, has also been seen to be associated with iniencephaly.

===Obesity===

Studies have shown that obesity of the mother increases the risk of neural tube disorders such as iniencephaly by 1.7 fold while severe obesity increases the risk by over 3 fold.

===History of iniencephaly===

Once a mother has given birth to a child with iniencephaly, risk of reoccurrence increases to 1-5%.

==Pathogenesis==
The exact pathogenesis of iniencephaly is still unknown though there are proposed theories, most of which view the neural tube malformation from the primary neural anomaly standpoint.
Marin-Padilla and MarinPadilla have proposed that the cause for the abnormalities has to do with a deficiency in the primary mesoderm. P. Erdinçler, et al. suggests from their findings that the cause of the anomaly is actually a defect in the occipital bone and rachischisis of the posterior vertebral arches leading to herniation of neural tissue through the opening in the bone during gestation.

==Diagnosis==
The most accurate method of diagnosis is prenatal screening through real-time fetal images. However, since maternal body habitus leads to diagnostic difficulties using this method, MRI and sonography are the most commonly used technique since there is no exposure to ionizing radiation. At the beginning of the second trimester, the central nervous system (CNS) and anatomic structures of the fetus can be clearly visualized and the characteristic malformations of iniencephaly, such as a shortened trunk, marked lordosis in the cervicothoracic vertebrae, absence or partial absence of the occipital squama, abnormal fusion of vertebrae, closed vertebral arches, formation of an encephalocele (for iniencephaly apertus), and dorsiflexion of the head in respect to the spine, can be precisely diagnosed as well as the severity and location established. Once established, further decisions can be made with regard to terminating the pregnancy or providing a plan of adequate postnatal care.

===Differential diagnosis===
Since many of the characteristics of iniencephaly, such as congenital retroflexion of the spine and fusion of the cervical vertebrae, are shared with other disorders, key differences are important to note.

While anencephaly experiences a partial to total lack of the neurocranium, iniencephaly does not. In anencephaly, the retroflexed head is not covered with skin while in iniencephaly, the retroflexed head is covered with skin entirely. Cervical vertebrae are malformed and reduced in iniencephaly while they are almost normal in anencephaly.

Even though KFS does experience malformed cervical vertebra due to failure of segmentation during early fetal development, there is not retroflexion of the head as seen in iniencephaly. While iniencephaly clausus is fatal, KFS is not and can be surgically corrected. Therefore, it is crucial to correctly diagnose KFS and not mistake it for iniencephaly clausus.

==Prevention==
Pregnant mothers are advised to take folic acid supplements to reduce risk of iniencephaly by up to 70%. Pregnant mothers are also advised not to take antiepileptic drugs, diuretics, antihistamines, and sulfa drugs, all of which have been associated with increased risk for neural tube defects.

==Treatment==
Since newborns with iniencephaly so rarely survive past childbirth, a standard treatment does not exist.

==Prognosis==
Iniencephaly of both types carry a lethal prognosis, sometimes even ending in spontaneous abortion or stillborns. Most infants die within hours of childbirth. There are only seven reported cases of relatively long-term survival of those born with iniencephaly.

==Epidemiology==
Iniencephaly is thought to make up around 1% of all fetal abnormalities, with an incidence rate estimated at 0.1 to 10 in 10,000 deliveries.
For unknown reasons, this disease seems to occur most often in newborn females (about 90%).

<text>Lissencephaly (, meaning &#x27;smooth brain&#x27;) is a set of rare brain disorders whereby the whole or parts of the surface of the brain appear smooth. It is caused by defective neuronal migration during the 12th to 24th weeks of gestation, resulting in a lack of development of brain folds (gyri) and grooves (sulci). It is a form of cephalic disorder. Terms such as &quot;agyria&quot; (no gyri) and &quot;pachygyria&quot; (broad gyri) are used to describe the appearance of the surface of the brain.

Children with lissencephaly generally have significant developmental delays, but these vary greatly from child to child depending on the degree of brain malformation and seizure control. Life expectancy can be shortened, generally due to respiratory problems. 

==Signs and symptoms==

Affected children display severe psychomotor impairment, failure to thrive, seizures, and muscle spasticity or hypotonia. Other symptoms of the disorder may include unusual facial appearance, difficulty swallowing, and anomalies of the hands, fingers, or toes.

Symptoms of lissencephaly are detected via ultrasound at about twenty-three weeks of gestation and require confirmation via prenatal MRI. It is characterized by absence or reduction of the sulci and gyri of the cerebral surface and a thickened cortex.

There are anatomical symptoms that differ across the two main types of lissencephaly, Classical (Type I) and Cobblestone (Type 2). In classical lissencephaly, the cerebral cortex becomes thickened and has only four identifiable layers rather than the usual six.

Cobblestone lissencephaly is named after the pebbled or cobblestone appearance of the cortical surface. This uneven cortical surface is due to incomplete organogenesis which leads to no distinguishable layers in the cerebral cortex. Cobblestone lissencephaly shows a reduction and abnormalities in the grey matter of the cerebral cortex.

==Causes==
Causes of lissencephaly can include viral infections of the uterus or the fetus during the first trimester, or insufficient blood supply to the fetal brain early in pregnancy. There are also a number of genetic causes of lissencephaly, including mutation of the reelin gene (on chromosome 7), as well as other genes on the X chromosome and on chromosome 17. Genetic counseling is usually offered if there is a risk of lissencephaly, coupled with genetic testing.

===Neuronal migration===
Folding of the cerebral cortex is important in the development of overall brain function and cognitive abilities. Neuronal migration is the process by which neurons migrate to the final position in the brain during the development of the nervous system. This development of the nervous system occurs between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation. The neurons are created at the ventricular zone. The neurons then extend along the radial glia to reach the cortical zone. It is the disruption of the radial and tangential migration that causes reduced or absent gyri that is known as lissencephaly.

The lack of gyri causing a smooth appearance of the cerebral cortex is due to abnormal neuronal migration in the developmental stages of the nervous system. The cause of lissencephaly has been linked to both genetic and non-genetic factors. Three main types of lissencephaly have been identified and although all types display the similar symptoms the pathogenesis of each type varies.

The genes associated with lissencephaly are still being discovered; however, due to advances in genetics individual genes are being identified as the cause of lissencephaly. Mutations in &quot;LIS1&quot;, &quot;DCX&quot; (doublecortin), &quot;ARX&quot; (aristaless related homeobox), &quot;RELN&quot; have all been identified to cause lissencephaly. Viral infections can also cause lissencephaly.

The known genetic and viral causes are listed below:

====&quot;LIS1&quot;====
&quot;LIS1&quot; (also known as &quot;PAFAH1B1&quot;) is the most widely studied. &quot;LIS1&quot; is located on chromosome 17p13.3. &quot;LIS1&quot; is integral in regulating the motor protein dynein which plays an important role in the movement of neuronal nuclei along microtubules. The mutation or deletion involving &quot;LIS1&quot; is associated with both Isolated Lissencephaly syndrome and Miller–Dieker syndrome. Miller-Dieker syndrome, however, has additional deletions of adjacent genes on chromosome 17 causing facial and other congenital abnormalities and defects. This mutation full or deletion of chromosome 17p13.3 leads to inadequate neuronal migration due to &quot;LIS1&quot; encoding for an enzyme that interacts with the microtubule protein dynein. &quot;LIS1&quot; mutation or deletion is not inherited from a parent and thus recurrence is unlikely.

A Chinese family with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and a mutation in this gene has been reported.

====&quot;DCX&quot;====

&quot;DCX&quot; or doublecortin encodes for the doublecortin protein which is similar to LIS1 as it encodes a microtubule associated protein that is related to microtubule function and transport in developing neuronal processes. &quot;DCX&quot; mutation causes the disorganisation of neocortical layering in the cerebral cortex leading to a reduced folding. &quot;DCX&quot; is localised to the X chromosome and thus this mutation may be inherited however it still can appear randomly. As it is an X chromosome linked abnormality males who inherit the gene are more likely to be severely affected. Females who inherit the DCX mutation have a more mild version of the syndrome.

====&quot;ARX&quot;====
The &quot;ARX&quot; gene encodes for the aristaless related homeobox genes which are active in the early embryonic development to control formation of many tissues and structure. ARX is involved in the development of the embryonic forebrain, migration and communication of neurons as well as migration and proliferation of interneurons. As ARX is expressed in the ganglionic eminences and the neocortical ventricular zone it can affect both radial and tangential migration. Similar to &quot;DCX&quot;, &quot;ARX&quot; is an X chromosome linked gene and is linked with other symptoms such as absence of portions of the brain, abnormal genitalia and severe epilepsy.

====&quot;RELN&quot;====

Reelin (RELN) is an extracellular matrix glycoproteins that is secreted to help with the regulation of neuronal migration. Lack of RELN in mice has shown deficiencies in migrating neurons. In reported cases, lissencephaly caused by RELN deficiency has been more severe in anterior brain regions with a very small cerebellum.

=== Viral infection ===
Lissencephaly has been recorded to have been caused by viruses and insufficient blood supply to the developing fetal brain. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpes-related virus that can cause congenital defects. CMV has a high affinity for the developing germinal matrix of the brain. The severity of the infection is proportional to the time in gestation that the fetus was infected. It is early infection that leads to lissencephaly. This is because early infection disrupts the migration and development of neurons.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of lissencephaly is usually made at birth or soon after by ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these results should be interpreted cautiously since even experienced radiologists can misdiagnose polymicrogyria, a different developmental malformation of the brain, as lissencephaly.

Before birth, complex ultrasounds performed routinely during pregnancy may indicate the presence of a cerebral abnormality, but this method of diagnosis should be complemented by other methods, such as genetic studies and NMR, and the examination is not recommended as part of routine ultrasound examinations, unless family medical history or other reasons for suspecting brain malformation are present. The earliest point during gestation when it is possible to observe abnormal development of the brain surface is approximately in week 20, although ultrasound examinations in week 25–30 are more common. Up to this time, the fetal brain normally has a smooth appearance. If lissencephaly is suspected, chorionic villus sampling can test for some lissencephaly variants, but only those with a known genetic mutation.

===Classification===
The spectrum of lissencephaly is only now becoming more defined as neuroimaging and genetics have provided more insights into migration disorders. There are around 20 types of lissencephaly that make up the spectrum. Other causes which have not yet been identified are likely as well.

Different systems for classifying lissencephaly exist. One major distinction is &quot;classic&quot; (type I) vs. &quot;cobblestone&quot; (type II), but some systems add additional forms that fit into neither of these categories.

Some types of lissencephaly are described below (OMIM numbers are included where available):

==Treatment==
Treatment for those with lissencephaly is symptomatic and depends on the severity and locations of the brain malformations. Treatment is tailored towards the symptoms of the individual. Therapies for lissencephaly are to deal with the symptoms as the syndrome is congenital. Supportive care may be needed to help with comfort and nursing needs. Seizures may be controlled with medication and hydrocephalus may require shunting. If feeding becomes difficult, a gastrostomy tube may be considered.

There are a number of organisations that raise awareness and funding for rare disabilities such as lissencephaly. They also seek to increase the quality of life for individuals living with related disabilities. In the United States, these organizations include Arc of the United States, National Organization for Rare Disorders, and March of Dimes.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for children with lissencephaly varies depending on the malformation and severity of the syndrome. Many individuals remain at a 3–5 month developmental level. Life expectancy is short and many children with lissencephaly will die before the age of 10. Some children with lissencephaly will be able to roll over, sit, reach for objects, and smile socially. Aspiration and respiratory disease are the most common causes of illness or death. In the past, life expectancy was said to be around two years of age. However, with advances in seizure control, and treatments for respiratory illness, most children affected can live well beyond that age. With other advances in therapy and the broader availability of services and equipment, some children with lissencephaly are able to walk with varying degrees of assistance and to perform other functions once thought too advanced.

<text>Megalencephaly (or macrencephaly; abbreviated MEG) is a growth development disorder in which the brain is abnormally large. It is characterized by a brain with an average weight that is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean of the general population. Approximately 1 out of 50 children (2%) are said to have the characteristics of megalencephaly in the general population.

A mutation in the PI3K-AKT pathway is believed to be the primary cause of brain proliferation and ultimately the root cause of megalencephaly. This mutation has produced a classification of brain overdevelopment that consists of two syndromes including megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polydactyly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus (MPPH). Megalencephaly is usually diagnosed at birth and is confirmed with an MRI.

There are several neuropsychiatric disorders linked with megalencephaly; however, studies have shown that autism is the most prevalent association with the malformation of MEG. Although no treatment currently exists for megalencephaly, management methods are focused at reducing deficits linked with autism. Most recent research is targeted at creating inhibitors to reduce the mutational pathway that causes megalencephaly.

==Classification==

===Macrocephaly===
Macrocephaly is a term used to refer to a person who has an abnormally large head. The circumference of the head must be above the 97th percentile or at least 2 standard deviations from the mean of normal weight and gender groups, according to the World Health Organization recommendations. A person with macrocephaly does not necessarily indicate that megalencephaly is also present. Large skulls usually exhibit no neurodevelopment conditions at all, meaning most individuals with macrocephaly are healthy.

===Hemimegalencephaly===
Hemimegalencephaly is an extremely rare form of macrocephaly and is characterized by uneven development of brain hemispheres (one half of the brain is larger than the other). It can present by itself or in association with phakomatosis or hemigigantism. Additionally, hemimegalencephaly will frequently cause severe epilepsy, focal neuro-logical deficits, macrocrania, and mild to severe intellectual disability.

=== MCAP ===
Megalencephaly-capillary (MCAP) is one of the two major syndromes of megalencephaly. Typically, MCAP and MPPH can be distinguished by somatic features. MCAP includes many characteristics that are observed at birth including: cutaneous vascular malformations, especially capillary malformations of the face and cutis marmorata, polydactyly, connective tissue dysplasia, and focal or segmental body overgrowth. Furthermore, MCAP can occasionally be linked with asymmetric brain overgrowth (hemimegalencephaly) as well as segmental overgrowth of the body (hemihypertrophy).

=== MPPH ===
Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) is one of the two major syndromes contributing to megalencephaly. Typically MCAP and MPPH can be distinguished by somatic features. In differentiation to MCAP, MPPH lacks consistent somatic features other than postaxial polydactyly. Furthermore, brain and body development is normally symmetric in the majority of patients that appear to have MPPH symptoms.

==Presentation==

===Autism===

There is an extremely high association between megalencephaly and autism. Approximately 20% of autistic children have megalencephaly, making it the most common physical characteristic of autism. People who present both megalencephaly and autistic characteristics usually also show signs of hyperactivity as a major symptom. However, there is no definitive evidence that autism is the primary cause/result of megalencephaly.

Since most children with megalencephaly also have autism, the goal of treatment for MEG is focused on managing the signs and symptoms associated with autism.

===Other associations===
Megalencephaly is also seen in the following conditions:

* Achondroplasia
* Acrocephalosyndactyly type I
* Chromosome 4Q32.1-q32.2 triplication syndrome
* Craniometadiaphyseal dysplasia wormian bone type
* Curry-Jones syndrome
* Early-onset parkinsonism-intellectual disability syndrome
* Intellectual disability, autosomal recessive 34
* Macrocephaly, dysmorphic facies, and psychomotor retardation
* Macrocephaly-intellectual disability-neurodevelopmental disorder-small thorax syndrome
* Macrocephaly/megalencephaly syndrome, autosomal recessive
* Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts
* Megalencephaly with dysmyelination
* Megalencephaly, autosomal dominant
* Megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria syndrome
* Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome 1 and 3
* Polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy
* Pseudoaminopterin syndrome
* Severe achondroplasia-developmental delay-acanthosis nigricans syndrome

==Causes==

Although very little is still known as to the direct cause of megalencephaly, recent studies have begun to provide early indications of possible sources for its formation. Recent research has shown that there is a strong link between genetic pathways that cause brain develop and mutations in that pathway that result in brain overgrowth.

===PI3K-AKT===
Recent studies have shown that mutations in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT (also known as protein kinase B) pathway have been identified in MCAP and MPPH. This pathway has proven to be an integral part of brain growth and development and is an area of interest to many researchers who study the cause of megalencephaly. Mutations in this pathway have been shown to cause a gain of function in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. This cellular pathway is critical in the regulation of diverse cell functions including, cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and most importantly in regards to megalencephaly, brain development. AKT is a crucial signaling molecule part of the PI3K pathway and is also involved in many cellular functions. These functions include, brain development, synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment. Loss of function in AKT can cause microcephaly in humans while inactivation of the pathway can cause hemimegalencephaly. There are also several cancers that have been shown to be linked with mutations in the AKT pathway, including melanoma and lung cancer.

===Pur-alpha===
Pur-alpha (purα) is a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA and RNA-binding protein. Studies have shown that the protein is primarily active during early development and is believed to have a role in brain enlargement. Although the exact function is still controversial, it is believed that pur-alpha is responsible for neuronal proliferation during neurogenesis as well as the maturation of dendrites. Thus, pur-alpha is also considered a potential root cause of megalencephaly and brain overgrowth.

==Pathophysiology==

One impact of megalencephaly is the complete lack of motor development. One medical study assessed three patients presenting megalencephaly who showed severely impaired motor and speech development as well as distinct facial abnormalities including skull bossing, a low nasal bridge and large eyes.

==Diagnoses==
Diagnosis of megalencephaly has changed over the years, however, with the development of more advanced equipment, physicians have been able to confirm the disorder with better accuracy. Usually, a physical exam is first performed when characteristics of megalencephaly have appeared. This typically occurs at birth or during early child development. A physician will then take head measurements in order to determine the circumference. This is known as the head circumference. Then a family background will be recorded in order to determine if there has been a history of megalencephaly in the family.

A neurological exam will then be performed using the technology of an MRI machine in order to confirm the diagnosis of megalencephaly. These imaging tests give detailed information regarding brain size, volume asymmetry and other irregular developments linked with MCAP, MPPH and hemimegalencephaly.

There is also a strong correlation of epilepsy and megalencephaly and this can aid doctors in their diagnosis.

If a diagnosis of megalencephaly is confirmed, the child is referred to a specialist who focuses on managing the symptoms and improving lifestyle. Since megalencephaly is usually presented with autism, the goal of treatment is to improve deficiencies associated with autistic causes. Additionally, since each patient has unique symptoms, there is no one specific treatment method and therefore is heavily reliant on symptoms associated with an individual.

==Prevention==
Since there are very few treatment methods focused on managing megalencephaly, future research is targeted at inhibiting mutation of the pathway. However, this next step could be met with several complications as understanding the underlying mechanism of the mutation is a difficult task. The genetic coding that initiates a single mutation is sporadic and patterns are hard to detect in many cases.
Even though very little research has been done to create inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT pathway, several pharmaceutical companies have begun to focus their interests in designing a prevention method for this purpose.

==Treatment==
There is currently no specific treatment for megalencephaly, however periodic head measurements may be assessed to determine the rate of brain growth.
Those individuals who develop neurological disorders may be prescribed anti-epileptic drugs for seizures. Studies have shown that reducing epilepsy can increase cell apoptosis and reduce the proliferation of neurons that ultimately leads to brain overgrowth.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of megalencephaly depends heavily on the underlying cause and associated neurological disorders. Because the majority of megalencephaly cases are linked with autism, the prognosis is equivalent to the corresponding condition.
Since hemimegalencephaly is associated with severe seizures, hemiparesis and intellectual disability, the result is a poor prognosis. In most cases, those diagnosed with this type of megalencephaly usually do not survive through adulthood.

==Epidemiology==

Approximately one out of every 50 (2%) children in the general population are said to have megalencephaly. Additionally, it is said that megalencephaly affects 3–4 times more males than females.
Those individuals that are classified with macrocephaly, or general head overgrowth, are said to have megalencephaly at a rate of 10–30% of the time.

==History==

It is believed that megalencephaly was discovered in 1972. Prior to diagnoses that used MRI scanning as a way to confirm brain overgrowth, cases of megalencephaly were diagnosed by autopsy in which the physical brain was measured and weighed.

==Research==
Future research is targeted at further understanding mutations and how they lead to MCAP and MPPH syndromes. The majority of studies of megalencephaly have included mice who present brain abnormalities and overgrowth. The next step is to move to clinical trials involving humans in order to determine the exact genetic mutation causing the sequences. Additionally, scientists and pharmaceutical companies have begun to show interest in mutation inhibition and designing preventative methods to eliminate the underlying cause of megalencephaly altogether.

== Other relations ==
Intracranial volume also affects this pathology, since it is related with the size of the brain.

<doc id="232050" wikidata="Q3986307" url="?curid=232050" title="The Clash at Bonds International Casino">
<text>The Clash played a series of 17 concerts at Bonds International Casino in New York City in May and June 1981 in support of their album &quot;Sandinista!&quot;. Due to their wide publicity, the concerts became an important moment in the history of the band. Some of the nights were professionally recorded either for CBS records or for FM broadcast. The 9 June performance appears on countless bootleg records and several songs have appeared on &quot;From Here to Eternity: Live&quot; or other official Clash releases.

The site of the concerts was formerly Bonds department store which had been converted into a large second-floor hall. Promoters kept the name because there was a large Bonds sign on the outside of the building. As The Clash had not yet broken out into mass popularity, eight shows were originally scheduled: 28, 29, 30, 31 May and 1, 2, 3 and 5 June 1981. However, given the venue&#x27;s legal capacity limit of 1750, the series was blatantly oversold (3500) right from the first night, leading the New York City Fire Department to cancel the Saturday, 30 May performance. In response, the band condemned the brazen greed of the promoters while demonstrating unprecedented integrity to each and every ticketholder by doubling the original booking with a total of 17 dates extending through June.

Strict interpretation of the fire laws meant that audiences were relatively small, resulting in a sense of intimacy between the band and the audience. Audience members clambered onto the stage to join in singalongs. New York musicians, including Pearl Harbor, assisted and overseen by Andy Dunkley, provided disc jockey services as the audience entered and gathered.

The concert captures The Clash on the verge of their major American market breakthrough with the release of &quot;Combat Rock&quot; a year later. The concert also displayed the band on the cusp between being a cult band and their major market penetration. As always with The Clash, ticket and merchandise prices were set relatively low. Prices were $10 per ticket and $5 per ticket for matinee shows.

The band had a new opening act every night, including The Fall, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Dead Kennedys, Bad Brains, Kraut, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and many more. Many of the hip-hop groups that opened were either picketed or booed off the stage, which prompted Joe to chide the audience as soon as The Clash came on stage afterwards. Melle Mel later said that when they tried to perform the section of &quot;Beat Street&quot; with the, &quot;Say Ho!&quot;, the audience members would yell, &quot;Fuck you!&quot;.

<doc id="232051" wikidata="Q431643" url="?curid=232051" title="Microcephaly">
<text>Microcephaly (from Neo-Latin &quot;microcephalia&quot;, from Ancient Greek μικρός &quot;mikrós&quot; &quot;small&quot; and κεφαλή &quot;kephalé&quot; &quot;head&quot;) is a medical condition involving a smaller-than-normal head. Microcephaly may be present at birth or it may develop in the first few years of life. Brain development is often affected; people with this disorder often have an intellectual disability, poor motor function, poor speech, abnormal facial features, seizures and dwarfism.
The disorder is caused by a disruption to the genetic processes that form the brain early in pregnancy, though the cause is not identified in most cases. Many genetic syndromes can result in microcephaly, including chromosomal and single-gene conditions, though almost always in combination with other symptoms. Mutations that result solely in microcephaly (primary microcephaly) exist but are less common. External toxins to the embryo, such as alcohol during pregnancy or vertically transmitted infections, can also result in microcephaly. Microcephaly serves as an important neurological indication or warning sign, but no uniformity exists in its definition. It is usually defined as a head circumference (HC) more than two standard deviations below the mean for age and sex. Some academics advocate defining it as head circumference more than three standard deviations below the mean for the age and sex.
There is no specific treatment that returns the head size to normal. In general, life expectancy for individuals with microcephaly is reduced, and the prognosis for normal brain function is poor. Occasional cases develop normal intelligence and grow normally (apart from persistently small head circumference). It is reported that in the United States, microcephaly occurs in 1 in 800-5,000 births.

==Signs and symptoms==
There are a variety of symptoms that can occur in children. Infants with microcephaly are born with either a normal or reduced head size. Subsequently, the head fails to grow, while the face continues to develop at a normal rate, producing a child with a small head and a receding forehead, and a loose, often wrinkled scalp. As the child grows older, the smallness of the skull becomes more obvious, although the entire body also is often underweight and dwarfed.

Severely impaired intellectual development is common, but disturbances in motor functions may not appear until later in life. Affected newborns generally have striking neurological defects and seizures. Development of motor functions and speech may be delayed. Hyperactivity and intellectual disability are common occurrences, although the degree of each varies. Convulsions may also occur. Motor ability varies, ranging from clumsiness in some to spastic quadriplegia in others.

==Causes==
Microcephaly is a type of cephalic disorder. It has been classified in two types based on the onset:

===Congenital===

* Isolated
*# Familial (autosomal recessive) microcephaly
*# Autosomal dominant microcephaly
*# X-linked microcephaly
*# Chromosomal (balanced rearrangements and ring chromosome)
* Syndromes
** Chromosomal
**# Poland syndrome
**# Down syndrome

Genetic mutations cause most cases of microcephaly. Relationships have been found between autism, duplications of genes and macrocephaly on one side. On the other side, a relationship has been found between schizophrenia, deletions of genes and microcephaly. Several genes have been designated &quot;MCPH&quot; genes, after microcephalin (&quot;MCPH1&quot;), based on their role in brain size and primary microcephaly syndromes when mutated. In addition to microcephalin, these include &quot;WDR62&quot; (&quot;MCPH2&quot;), &quot;CDK5RAP2&quot; (&quot;MCPH3&quot;), &quot;KNL1&quot; (&quot;MCPH4&quot;), &quot;ASPM&quot; (&quot;MCPH5&quot;), &quot;CENPJ&quot; (&quot;MCPH6&quot;), &quot;STIL&quot; (&quot;MCPH7&quot;), &quot;CEP135&quot; (&quot;MCPH8&quot;), &quot;CEP152&quot; (&quot;MCPH9&quot;), &quot;ZNF335&quot; (&quot;MCPH10&quot;), &quot;PHC1&quot; (&quot;MCPH11&quot;) and &quot;CDK6&quot; (&quot;MCPH12&quot;). Moreover, an association has been established between common genetic variants within known microcephaly genes (such as &quot;MCPH1&quot; and &quot;CDK5RAP2&quot;) and normal variation in brain structure as measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)i.e., primarily brain cortical surface area and total brain volume.

===Arbovirus===
Bites and stings from Arthropods can often be a cause of vector-borne diseases. These include mosquitoes, fleas, sand flies, lice, ticks, and mites that are hematophagous vectors. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stated that &quot;mosquitoes kill more people than any other creature and considers that mosquitoes are &quot;the most dangerous animals on earth&quot;.

The spread of Aedes mosquito-borne Zika virus has been implicated in increasing levels of congenital microcephaly by the International Society for Infectious Diseases and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Zika can spread from a pregnant woman to her fetus. This can result in other severe brain malformations and birth defects. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine has documented a case in which they found evidence of the Zika virus in the brain of a fetus that displayed the morphology of microcephaly.
===Microlissencephaly===

Microlissencephaly is microcephaly combined with lissencephaly (smooth brain surface due to absent sulci and gyri). Most cases of microlissencephaly are described in consanguineous families, suggesting an autosomal recessive inheritance.

===Historical causes of microcephaly===

After the dropping of atomic bombs &quot;Little Boy&quot; on Hiroshima and &quot;Fat Man&quot; on Nagasaki, several women close to ground zero who had been pregnant at the time gave birth to children with microcephaly. Microcephaly was present in 7 children from a group of 11 pregnant women at 11–17 weeks of gestation who survived the blast at less than from ground zero. Due to their proximity to the bomb, the pregnant women&#x27;s &quot;in utero&quot; children received a biologically significant radiation dose that was relatively high due to the massive neutron output of the lower explosive-yielding Little Boy. Researchers studied 286 additional children who were in utero during the atomic bombings, and after a year they found these children had a higher incidence of microcephaly and mental retardation.

=== Other relations ===
Intracranial volume also affects this pathology, as it is related with the size of the brain.

==Pathophysiology==

Microcephaly generally is due to the diminished size of the largest part of the human brain, the cerebral cortex, and the condition can arise during embryonic and fetal development due to insufficient neural stem cell proliferation, impaired or premature neurogenesis, the death of neural stem cells or neurons, or a combination of these factors. Research in animal models such as rodents has found many genes that are required for normal brain growth. For example, the Notch pathway genes regulate the balance between stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the stem cell layer known as the ventricular zone, and experimental mutations of many genes can cause microcephaly in mice, similar to human microcephaly. Mutations of the abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene are associated with microcephaly in humans and a knockout model has been developed in ferrets that exhibits severe microcephaly. In addition, viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Zika have been shown to infect and kill the primary stem cell of the brain—the radial glial cell, resulting in the loss of future daughter neurons. The severity of the condition may depend on the timing of infection during pregnancy.

Microcephaly is a feature common to several different genetic disorders arising from a deficiency in the cellular DNA damage response. Individuals with the following DNA damage response disorders exhibit microcephaly: Nijmegen breakage syndrome, ATR-Seckel syndrome, MCPH1-dependent primary microcephaly disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A deficiency, Fanconi anemia, ligase 4 deficiency syndrome and Bloom syndrome. These findings suggest that a normal DNA damage response is critical during brain development, perhaps to protect against induction of apoptosis by DNA damage occurring in neurons.

==Treatment==

There is no known cure for microcephaly. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Because some cases of microcephaly and its associated symptoms may be a result of amino acid deficiencies, treatment with amino acids in these cases has been shown to improve symptoms such as seizures and motor function delays.

==History==
People with small heads were displayed as a public spectacle in ancient Rome.

People with microcephaly were sometimes sold to freak shows in North America and Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries, where they were known by the name &quot;pinheads&quot;. Many of them were presented as different species (e.g., &quot;monkey man&quot;) and described as being the missing link. Famous examples include Zip the Pinhead (although he may not have had microcephaly), Maximo and Bartola and Schlitzie the Pinhead. Stars of the 1932 film Freaks were cited as influences on the development of the long-running comic strip character Zippy the Pinhead, created by Bill Griffith.
==Notable cases==
* A &#x27;dwarf&#x27; of Punt (ancient Somalia) was given by the Chief clans as partial tribute to the last ruler of Ancient Egypt&#x27;s Old Kingdom, Pepi II Neferkare (6th Dynasty, circa 2125–2080 BC); it could be inferred that this person was also microcephalic. In a letter preserved at the British Museum, the young king gives instructions by letter, &quot;Harkhuf! The men in your service [escorts; soldiers; sailors; guards, etc.] ought pay sincere care with the dwarf&#x27;s head while sleeping during the voyage to the palace&quot; (so that it does not fall off). At the same time, it could be for other reasons unrelated to microcephaly, etc.
* &quot;Triboulet&quot;, a jester of duke René of Anjou (not to be confused with the slightly later Triboulet at the French court).
* Jenny Lee Snow and Elvira Snow, whose stage names were Pip and Flip, respectively, were sisters with microcephaly who acted in the 1932 film &quot;Freaks&quot;.
* Schlitze &quot;Schlitzie&quot; Surtees, possibly born Simon Metz, was a widely known sideshow performer and actor, who also appeared in &quot;Freaks&quot;.
* Lester &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; Green, a member of radio host Howard Stern&#x27;s Wack Pack.

<text>Porencephaly is an extremely rare cephalic disorder involving encephalomalacia. It is a neurological disorder of the central nervous system characterized by cysts or cavities within the cerebral hemisphere. Porencephaly was termed by Heschl in 1859 to describe a cavity in the human brain. Derived from Greek roots, the word &quot;porencephaly&quot; means &#x27;holes in the brain&#x27;. The cysts and cavities (cystic brain lesions) are more likely to be the result of destructive (encephaloclastic) cause, but can also be from abnormal development (malformative), direct damage, inflammation, or hemorrhage. The cysts and cavities cause a wide range of physiological, physical, and neurological symptoms. Depending on the patient, this disorder may cause only minor neurological problems, without any disruption of intelligence, while others may be severely disabled or die before the second decade of their lives. However, this disorder is far more common within infants, and porencephaly can occur both before or after birth.

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients diagnosed with porencephaly display a variety of symptoms, from mild to severe effects on the patient. Patients with severe cases of porencephaly have epileptic seizures and developmental delays, whereas patients with a mild case of porencephaly display little to no seizures and typical neurodevelopment. Infants with extensive defects show symptoms of the disorder shortly after birth, and the diagnosis is usually made before the age of 1.

The following text lists out common signs and symptoms of porencephaly in affected individuals along with a short description of certain terminologies.
==Cause==
Porencephaly is a rare disorder. The exact prevalence of porencephaly is not known; however, it has been reported that 6.8% of patients with cerebral palsy or 68% of patients with epilepsy and congenital vascular hemiparesis have porencephaly. Porencephaly has a number of different, often unknown, causes including absence of brain development and destruction of brain tissue. With limited research, the most commonly regarded cause of porencephaly is disturbances in blood circulation, ultimately leading to brain damage. However, a number of different and multiple factors such as abnormal brain development or damage to the brain tissue can also affect the development of porencephaly.

The following text lists out potential risk factors of developing porencephaly and porencephalic cysts and cavities along with brief description of certain terminologies.

Cysts or cavities can occur anywhere within the brain and the locations of these cysts depend highly on the patient. Cysts can develop in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, forebrain, hindbrain, temporal lobe, or virtually anywhere in the cerebral hemisphere.

===Genetics===

From recent studies, de novo and inherited mutations in the gene &quot;COL4A1&quot;, suggesting genetic predisposition within the family, that encodes type IV collagen α1 chain has shown to be associated with and present in patients with porencephaly. &quot;COL4A1&quot; mutation causes a variety of phenotypes, including porencephaly, infantile hemiplegia, and cerebral small vessel diseases involving both stroke and infarction. Abnormal gene expression of &quot;COL4A1&quot; can contribute to the development of porencephaly. &quot;COL4A1&quot; gene expresses a type IV collagen (basement protein) that is present in all tissue and blood vessels and is extremely important for the structural stability of vascular basement membranes. The &quot;COL4A1&quot; protein provides a strong layer around blood vessels. The mutation can weaken the blood vessels within the brain, elevating the probability of a hemorrhage, and eventually promoting internal bleeding then leading to porencephaly during neurodevelopment of infantile stage. Therefore, the formation of cavities can be a result of hemorrhages which promote cerebral degeneration. In a mouse model, mouse with &quot;COL4A1&quot; mutations displayed cerebral hemorrhage, porencephaly, and abnormal development of vascular basement membranes, such as uneven edges, inconsistent shapes, and highly variable thickness. Purposely causing a mutation in the &quot;COL4A1&quot; gene caused several mouse to develop cerebral hemorrhage and porencephaly-like diseases. Though, there is no direct correlation between mutations of the &quot;COL4A1&quot; gene, it appears that it has an influential effect on the development of porencephaly.

Another genetic mutation, &quot;factor V G1691A&quot; mutation, has been reported to show possible association to the development of porencephaly. A mutation in &quot;factor V G1691A&quot; increases the risk of thrombosis, blood clots, in neonates, infants, and children. Therefore, 76 porencephalic and 76 healthy infants were investigated for &quot;factor V G1691A&quot; mutation along with other different prothrombotic risk factors. The results indicated that there was higher prevalence of the &quot;factor V G1691A&quot; mutation in the porencephalic patient group. The prediction that childhood porencephaly is caused by hypercoagulable state, a condition where one has a higher chance of developing blood clots, was supported by the significance of the &quot;factor V G1691A&quot; mutation. Also, pregnant women in hypercoagulable state can cause the fetus to have the same risks, therefore possibly causing fetal loss, brain damage, lesions, and infections that lead to porencephaly. However, other different prothrombotic risk factors individually did not reach statistical significance to link it to the development of porencephaly, but a combination of multiple prothrombotic risk factors in the porencephaly group was significant. Overall, &quot;factor V G1691A&quot; mutation has been linked to the development of porencephaly. However, this one mutation is not the cause of porencephaly, and whether further prothrombiotic risk factors are associated with porencephaly still remains unknown.

===Cocaine and other street drugs===
In utero exposure to cocaine and other street drugs can lead to porencephaly.

==Diagnostics==

The presence of porencephalic cysts or cavities can be detected using trans-illumination of the skull of infant patients. Porencephaly is usually diagnosed clinically using the patients and families history, clinical observations, or based on the presence of certain characteristic neurological and physiological features of porencephaly. Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or with ultrasonography can be used as a method to exclude other possible neurological disorders. The diagnosis can be made antenatally with ultrasound. Other assessments include memory, speech, or intellect testing to help further determine the exact diagnose of the disorder.

==Treatments==

Currently, there is no cure for porencephaly because of the limited resources and knowledge about the neurological disorder. However, several treatment options are available. Treatment may include physical therapy, rehabilitation, medication for seizures or epilepsy, shunt (medical), or neurosurgery (removal of the cyst). According to the location, extent of the lesion, size of cavities, and severity of the disorder, combinations of treatment methods are imposed. In porencephaly patients, patients achieved good seizure control with appropriate drug therapy including valproate, carbamazepine, and clobazam. Also, anti-epileptic drugs served as another positive method of treatment.

==Prognosis==
The severity of the symptoms associated with porencephaly varies significantly across the population of those affected, depending on the location of the cyst and damage of the brain. For some patients with porencephaly, only minor neurological problems may develop, and those patients can live normal lives. Therefore, based on the level of severity, self-care is possible, but for the more serious cases lifelong care will be necessary. For those that have severe disability, early diagnosis, medication, participation in rehabilitation related to fine-motor control skills, and communication therapies can significantly improve the symptoms and ability of the patient with porencephaly to live a normal life. Infants with porencephaly that survive, with proper treatment, can display proper communication skills, movement, and live a normal life.

==Research==
Under the United States federal government, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and National Institute of Health are involved in conducting and supporting research related to normal and abnormal brain and nervous system development. Information gained from the research is used to develop understanding of the mechanism of porencephaly and used to offer new methods of treatment and prevention for developmental brain disorders such as porencephaly.

<text>Schizencephaly () is a rare birth defect of the brain, characterized by abnormal clefts lined with grey matter that form the ependyma of the cerebral ventricles to the pia mater. These clefts can occur bilaterally or unilaterally. Common clinical features of this malformation include epilepsy, motor deficits, and psychomotor retardation.

==Presentation==
Schizencephaly can be distinguished from porencephaly by the fact that in schizencephaly, the fluid-filled component is entirely lined by heterotopic grey matter, while a porencephalic cyst is lined mostly by white matter. Individuals with clefts in both hemispheres, or bilateral clefts, are often developmentally delayed and have delayed speech and language skills and corticospinal dysfunction. Individuals with smaller, unilateral clefts (clefts in one hemisphere) may be weak or paralyzed on one side of the body and may have average or near-average intelligence. Patients with schizencephaly may also have varying degrees of microcephaly, Cognitive impairment, hemiparesis (weakness or paralysis affecting one side of the body), or quadriparesis (weakness or paralysis affecting all four extremities), and may have reduced muscle tone (hypotonia). Most patients have seizures, and some may have hydrocephalus.

==Causes==
In schizencephaly, the neurons border the edge of the cleft, implying a very early disruption of the usual grey matter migration during embryogenesis. The cause of the disruption is not known; however it is likely the cause may be either a genetic mutation or a physical insult, such as an infection, an infarction, hemorrhaging, a stroke while in utero, or exposure to a toxin. Schizencephaly may also be caused infection during pregnancy, such as Cytomegalovirus. 

It is thought that normal neuron migration, during the second trimester of intrauterine development, is when primitive neuron precursors (germinal matrix) migrate from just beneath the ventricular ependyma to the peripheral hemispheres where they form the cortical grey matter. Often, with schizencephaly, there are additional associated heterotopias (isolated islands of neurons) which indicate a failure of migration of the neurons to their final position in the brain, possibly caused by a stroke. 

===Genetic cause===
There was once thought to be a genetic association with the &quot;EMX2&quot; gene, although this theory has recently lost support. However it has been confirmed that mutations in the &quot;COL4A1&quot; gene occur in some patients with schizencephaly.

==Diagnosis==
* Radiological methods like computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - unilateral or bilateral clefting of the brain.
* Genetic testing for confirmation of mutations in the genes associated with susceptibility to the condition.

==Treatment==
Treatment for individuals with schizencephaly generally consists of physical therapy (KG-ZNS with Vojta Methode), occupational therapy (with specific emphasis on neuro-developmental therapy techniques), treatment for seizures, and, in cases that are complicated by hydrocephalus, a shunt.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for individuals with schizencephaly varies depending on the size of the clefts and the degree of neurological deficit.

==Frequency==
In some cases, the defect is linked to mutations of the EMX2, SIX3, and Collagen, type IV, alpha 1 genes. Because having a sibling with schizencephaly has been statistically shown to increase risk of the disorder, it is possible that there is a heritable genetic component to the disease.

<text>Exencephaly is a type of cephalic disorder wherein the brain is located outside of the skull. This condition is usually found in embryos as an early stage of anencephaly. As an exencephalic pregnancy progresses, the neural tissue gradually degenerates.

The prognosis for infants born with exencephaly is extremely poor. It is rare to find an infant born with exencephaly, as most cases that are not early stages of anencephaly are usually stillborn. Those infants who are born with the condition usually die within hours or minutes. The disorder is caused by the failure of cranial neuropore to properly fuse between the 3rd and 4th week post conception. Because of this, the calvarium doesn&#x27;t develop/fuse properly and the brain extrudes from the cranium.

==Pathophysiology==
Until recently, the medical literature did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that are now being found to be related. As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying set of medical symptoms that are clinically visible in the disorders. Exencephaly is one disease that has recently been identified as part of an emerging class of diseases called cilopathies. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell, organelles which are present in many cell types throughout the human body. The cilia defects adversely affect &quot;numerous critical developmental signaling pathways&quot; essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases. Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alström syndrome, Meckel–Gruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration.

<text>Macrocephaly is a condition in which circumference of the human head is abnormally large. It may be pathological or harmless, and can be a familial genetic characteristic. People diagnosed with macrocephaly will receive further medical tests to determine whether the syndrome is accompanied by particular disorders. Those with benign or familial macrocephaly are considered to have megalencephaly.

==Causes==

Many people with abnormally large heads or large skulls are healthy, but macrocephaly may be pathological. Pathologic macrocephaly may be due to megalencephaly (enlarged brain), hydrocephalus (abnormally increased cerebrospinal fluid), cranial hyperostosis (bone overgrowth), and other conditions. Pathologic macrocephaly is called &quot;syndromic&quot;, when it is associated with any other noteworthy condition, and &quot;nonsyndromic&quot; otherwise. Pathologic macrocephaly may be caused by congenital anatomic abnormalities, genetic conditions, or by environmental events.

Many genetic conditions are associated with macrocephaly, including familial macrocephaly related to the holgate gene, autism, &quot;PTEN&quot; mutations such as Cowden disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis; overgrowth syndromes such as Sotos syndrome (cerebral gigantism), Weaver syndrome, Simpson–Golabi–Behmel syndrome (bulldog syndrome), and macrocephaly-capillary malformation (M-CMTC) syndrome; neurocardiofacial-cutaneous syndromes such as Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, Gorlin syndrome, (also known as basal cell nevus syndrome) and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome; Fragile X syndrome; leukodystrophies (brain white matter degeneration) such as Alexander disease, Canavan disease, and megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts; and glutaric aciduria type 1 and D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.

At one end of the genetic spectrum, duplications of chromosomes have been found to be related to autism and macrocephaly; at the other end, deletions of chromosomes have been found to be related to schizophrenia and microcephaly.

Environmental events associated with macrocephaly include infection, neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding within the infant brain), subdural hematoma (bleeding beneath the outer lining of the brain), subdural effusion (collection of fluid beneath the outer lining of the brain), and arachnoid cysts (cysts on the brain surface).

In research, cranial height or brain imaging may be used to determine intracranial volume more accurately.

==Diagnosis==
Macrocephaly is customarily diagnosed if head circumference is greater than two standard deviations (SDs) above the mean. Relative macrocephaly occurs if the measure is less than two SDs above the mean, but is disproportionately above that when ethnicity and stature are considered. Diagnosis can be determined in utero or can be determined within 18–24 months after birth in some cases where head circumference tends to stabilize in infants. Diagnosis in infants includes measuring the circumference of the child&#x27;s head and comparing how significant it falls above the 97.5 percentile of children similar to their demographic. If falling above the 97.5th percentile then the patient will be checked to determine whether there is any intracranial pressure present and whether or not immediate surgery is needed. If immediate surgery is not needed then further testing will be done to determine whether the patient has either macrocephaly or benign macrocephaly.

Diagnosis for macrocephaly involves the comparison of the infant&#x27;s head circumference to that of other infants of the same age and ethnicity. If a patient is suspected of having macrocephaly molecular testing will be used to confirm diagnosis. Symptoms vary on the cause of macrocephaly on the child and if the child has any other accompanying syndromes which will be determined through molecular testing.

=== Benign or familial macrocephaly ===
Benign macrocephaly can occur without reason or be inherited by one or both parents (in which it is considered benign familial macrocephaly and is considered a megalencephaly form of macrocephaly). Diagnosis for familial macrocephaly is determined by measuring the head circumference of both parents and comparing it to the child&#x27;s. Benign and familial macrocephaly is not associated with neurological disorders. While benign and familial macrocephaly do not result in neurological disorders, neurodevelopment will still need to be assessed.

Although neurological disorders do not occur, temporary symptoms of benign and familial macrocephaly include: developmental delay, epilepsy, and mild hypotonia.

Neurodevelopment is assessed for all cases and suspected cases of macrocephaly to determine whether and what treatments may be needed, and whether any other syndrome/s may be present or likely to develop.

=== Other forms ===
Other forms of macrocephaly include:

* Macrocephaly at birth: congenital macrocephaly already present at birth.
* Postnatal macrocephaly: macrocephaly developed postnatally (after birth).
* Progressive macrocephaly: macrocephaly developed progressively over time.
* Relative macrocephaly: mild macrocephaly measured under 2 SD from mean, but larger in appearance due to other factors (ex. short stature).

== Treatment ==
Treatment varies depending on whether or not it occurs with other medical conditions in the child and where the cerebrospinal fluid is present.
If benign and found between the brain and skull then no surgery is needed.
If excess fluid is found between the ventricle spaces in the brain then surgery will be needed.

<text>Brachycephaly (derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;&quot;, &#x27;short&#x27; and &quot;&quot;, &#x27;head&#x27;) is the shape of a skull shorter than average in its species. It is perceived as a cosmetically desirable trait in some domesticated dog and cat breeds, notably the pug and Persian, and can be normal or abnormal in other animal species. 

In humans, brachycephaly can appear both pathologically and non-pathologically as a result of normal human variation. It is particularly common in Mongolians and the Andamanese.

In anthropology, human populations have been characterized as either dolichocephalic (long-headed), mesocephalic (moderate-headed), or brachycephalic (short-headed). The usefulness of the cephalic index was questioned by Giuseppe Sergi, who argued that cranial morphology provided a better means to model racial ancestry.

When pathological, it is known as flat head syndrome, and it results from premature fusion of the coronal sutures, or from external deformation. The coronal suture is the fibrous joint that unites the frontal bone with the two parietal bones of the skull. The parietal bones form the top and sides of the skull. This feature can also be a symptom of Down syndrome.

There are also cases of brachycephaly associated with plagiocephaly. Brachycephaly with plagiocephaly is positional and has become more prevalent since the &quot;Back to Sleep&quot; campaign. The Back to Sleep campaign began in 1994 as a way to educate parents about ways to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The campaign was named for its recommendation to place healthy babies on their backs to sleep. Placing babies on their backs to sleep reduces the risk for SIDS, also known as &quot;cot death&quot; or &quot;crib death.&quot; This campaign has been successful in promoting infant back sleeping and other risk-reduction strategies to parents, family members, child care providers, health professionals, and all other caregivers of infants, at the cost of increasing the incidence of this deformation of the head. It is considered a cosmetic problem. Many pediatricians remain unaware of the issue and possible treatments. Treatments include regular prone repositioning of babies (&quot;tummy time&quot;).

==Brachycephaly as a trait in pets==
In pets, brachycephaly describes a type of skull with a high cephalic index, such as in snub-nosed breeds of dog such as pugs, Shih Tzus, and bulldogs or cats such as the Persian, Exotic and Himalayan. The term is from Greek roots meaning &#x27;short&#x27; and &#x27;head&#x27;. While being a cosmetically desirable trait of specific cat and dog breeds, the production and breeding of brachycephalic animals is considered animal abuse in a few jurisdictions. Due to the fact that animals with significantly shortened skulls frequently develop brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome, causing them to have difficulties when breathing, suffering from hyperthermia due to insufficient cooling abilities and frequent infections of the cornea and lacrimal glands. While the breeding of animals that will have significantly worsened life quality due to anatomical abnormalities is illegal in some European countries, the production of such breeds is still frequent. Apart from these, brachycephalic pups and kittens also have high prenatal mortality. Attention should be paid to breed standards which promote increased brachycephaly in cats which has the potential to negatively impact their welfare, and potential buyers of brachycephalic cat breeds should be made aware of the risks of their conformation.

Brachycephalic cat breeds such as the Burmese, Himalayan and Persian normally have mandibular mesioclusion — a condition involving the incisors not being aligned correctly. This can lead to the incisors injuring the gingival tissue. In mesaticephalic breeds this is considered abnormal.

==Treatment==
In humans, brachycephaly can be corrected with cranial remolding orthoses (helmets), which provide painless total contact over the prominent areas of the skull and leave voids over the flattened areas to provide a pathway for more symmetrical skull growth. Treatment generally takes 3–4 months, but varies depending on the infant&#x27;s age and the severity of the cranial asymmetry.

However, studies by scientists in the Netherlands investigating helmet therapy on mild to moderate cases of brachycephaly have found there was no significant difference over time between infants treated with helmets and infants left untreated. All parents of infants treated with helmets confirmed negative side effects including skin irritation and sweating.
The study was criticised by the American Orthotic &amp; Prosthetic Association in a letter to the &quot;New York Times&quot;. The letter noted that the study focused only on mild to moderate cases, saying that helmet treatment may still be useful for more severe cases. The letter also criticised the low participation rate (21%) of the randomized study, and noted that the incidence of fitting issues in the study, at 73%, &quot;seems very high&quot;.

<text>Turricephaly is a type of cephalic disorder where the head appears tall with a small length and width. It is due to premature closure of the coronal suture plus any other suture, like the lambdoid, or it may be used to describe the premature fusion of all sutures. It should be differentiated from Crouzon syndrome. Oxycephaly (or acrocephaly) is a form of turricephaly where the head is cone-shaped, and is the most severe of the craniosynostoses.

<doc id="232062" wikidata="Q2546232" url="?curid=232062" title="Plagiocephaly">
<text>Plagiocephaly, also known as flat head syndrome, is a condition characterized by an asymmetrical distortion (flattening of one side) of the skull. A mild and widespread form is characterized by a flat spot on the back or one side of the head caused by remaining in a supine position for prolonged periods.

Plagiocephaly is a diagonal asymmetry across the head shape. Often it is a flattening which is to one side at the back of the head and there is often some facial asymmetry. Depending on whether synostosis is involved, plagiocephaly divides into two groups: synostotic, with one or more fused cranial sutures, and non-synostotic (deformational). Surgical treatment of these groups includes the deference method; however, the treatment of deformational plagiocephaly is controversial. Brachycephaly describes a very wide head shape with a flattening across the whole back of the head.

==Causes==
Slight plagiocephaly is routinely diagnosed at birth and may be the result of a restrictive intrauterine environment giving a &quot;diamond&quot; shaped head when seen from above. If there is premature union of skull bones, this is more properly called craniosynostosis.

The incidence of plagiocephaly has increased dramatically since the advent of anti-sudden infant death syndrome recommendations for parents to keep their babies on their backs.

Data also suggest that the rates of plagiocephaly are higher for twins and multiple births, premature babies, babies who were positioned in the breech position or back-to-back, as well as for babies born after a prolonged labour.
=== Conditions and syndromes ===
Plagiocephaly is seen in multiple conditions:
* Arthrogryposis, cleft palate, craniosynostosis, and impaired intellectual development
* Autism, susceptibility to, X-linked 2
* Blepharophimosis-impaired intellectual development syndrome
* Cardiac anomalies - developmental delay - facial dysmorphism syndrome
* CHIME syndrome
* Coffin-Siris syndrome 1 and 6
* Congenital nonprogressive myopathy with Moebius and Robin sequences
* Cornelia de Lange syndrome 3
* Cranioectodermal dysplasia 2
* Craniosynostosis (nonsyndromic) 6
* Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, 1, 65, 77, and 84
* Developmental delay with variable intellectual impairment and behavioral abnormalities
* Dihydropyrimidinase deficiency
* Early-onset progressive diffuse brain atrophy-microcephaly-muscle weakness-optic atrophy syndrome
* Faciocardiorenal syndrome
* FG syndrome
* Galloway-Mowat syndrome 4
* Gaze palsy, familial horizontal, with progressive scoliosis 1
* Hyperphosphatasia with intellectual disability syndrome 1 and 2
* Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 2
* Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 64 and 66
* Intellectual disability, autosomal dominant 13, 40, 48, and 58
* Joubert syndrome 1
* Kleefstra syndrome 2
* Langer-Giedion syndrome
* Microphthalmia with brain and digit anomalies
* Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 13
* Muenke syndrome
* Noonan syndrome 13
* Osteogenesis imperfecta, type 20
* Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 4

* Saethre-Chotzen syndrome
* Spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, nystagmus, and obesity
* Syndromic X-linked intellectual disability Najm type

==Diagnosis==
A developmental and physical assessment performed by a physician or a pediatric specialist is recommended. Often imaging is obtained if the diagnosis is questionable to see if the baby&#x27;s sutures are present or not. If the sutures are not present, craniosynostosis may be ruled into question.

It is also common for an infant with positional plagiocephaly to have misaligned ears (the ear on the affected side may be pulled forward and down and be larger or protrude more than the unaffected ear).

==Prevention==
Prevention methods include carrying the infant and giving the infant time to play on their stomach (tummy time), which may prevent the baby from progressing into moderate or severe plagiocephaly.

Letting babies crawl may also prove to be crucial in preventing plagiocephaly as it strengthens babies&#x27; spine and neck muscles. Crawling also boosts gross and fine motor skills (large and refined movements), balance, hand-eye-coordination and overall strength.

In addition, specialized mattresses are available to prevent plagiocephaly. The design of these mattresses is characterized by an ergonomic design that reduces pressure on the baby&#x27;s head. It is very important that these mattresses are certified to guarantee their effectiveness.

==Treatment==
The condition may improve to some extent as the baby grows, but in some cases, home treatment or physical therapy treatment can improve the shape of a baby&#x27;s head.

Early interventions (based on the severity) are of importance to reduce the severity of the degree of the plagiocephaly. Diagnosis is most commonly determined through clinical examination. In order to assess the severity of the condition and determine the best course of treatment, practitioners often use the Plagiocephaly Severity Scale. This is a scale that can help practitioners evaluate the condition in a standardized way.

The course of treatment is typically based on the age of the child when the diagnosis is made in conjunction with the severity of the diagnosis. If a diagnosis of mild to moderate plagiocephaly occurs before four months of age, repositioning therapy may be helpful. If the diagnosis is determined to be severe, practitioners will likely prescribe a cranial molding orthosis (helmet), which has the best results when prescribed between five and six months of age.

===Repositioning===
Initially, treatment usually takes the form of reducing the pressure on the affected area through repositioning of the baby onto their abdomen for extended periods of time throughout the day.

This may include repositioning the child&#x27;s head throughout the day so that the rounded side of the head is placed against the mattress, repositioning cribs and other areas that infants spend time in so that they will have to look in a different direction to see their parents or others in the room, repositioning mobiles and other toys for similar reasons, and avoiding extended time sleeping in car seats (when not in a vehicle), bouncy seats, or other supine seating which is thought to exacerbate the problem. If the child appears to have discomfort or cries when they are repositioned, a neck problem should be ruled out.

===Helmets===
High quality evidence is lacking for cranial remolding orthosis (baby helmet) for the positional condition and use for this purpose is controversial. If conservative treatment is unsuccessful, helmets may help to correct abnormal head shapes. These helmets are used to treat deformational plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, scaphocephaly and other head shape deformities in infants 3–18 months of age by gently allowing the head shape to grow back into a normal shape. This type of treatment has been used for severe deformations.

==Prognosis==
Preliminary research indicates that some babies with plagiocephaly may comprise a high-risk group for developmental difficulties. Plagiocephaly is associated with motor and language developmental delays. While developmental delay is more commonplace among babies with plagiocephaly, it cannot be inferred that plagiocephaly is the cause of the delay.

==Etymology==
Ancient Greek πλάγιος (&quot;plagios&quot;) &#x27;oblique, slanting&#x27;, from PIE &quot;plag-&quot; &#x27;flat, spread&#x27;, from *&quot;plak-&quot;, and Modern Latin &quot;cephal-&quot; &#x27;head, skull, brain&#x27; (from Greek κεφαλή), together means &#x27;flat head&#x27;.

<text>Scaphocephaly or sagittal craniosynostosis is a type of cephalic disorder which occurs when there is a premature fusion of the sagittal suture. Premature closure results in limited lateral expansion of the skull, resulting in a characteristic long, narrow head. The skull base is typically spared. The word comes .

Scaphocephaly is the most common of the craniosynostosis conditions and accounts for approximately 50% of all craniosynostosis. It is most commonly idiopathic (non-syndromic).

== Etiology ==
Non-syndromic

The underlying cause of the non-syndromic form is unknown. Over 100 mutations have been associated, including mutations in the FGFR genes. Several potential risk factors have been identified for craniosynostosis include:

* Advanced maternal age
* White maternal race
* Maternal smoking
* Male infant
* Certain paternal occupations (e.g. agriculture, forestry, repairmen) 

Syndromic

Sagittal craniosynostosis is seen in many conditions and syndromes:
* Acrocephalosyndactyly type I
* Baller–Gerold syndrome
* Cardiocranial syndrome, Pfeiffer type
* Coffin-Siris syndrome 7
* Cranioectodermal dysplasia 1, 3, and 4
* Craniosynostosis (nonsyndromic) 4
* Craniosynostosis and dental anomalies
* Craniosynostosis-anal anomalies-porokeratosis syndrome
* Craniosynostosis-Dandy-Walker malformation-hydrocephalus syndrome
* Crouzon syndrome
* Meier-Gorlin syndrome 7
* Neonatal diabetes mellitus with congenital hypothyroidism
* Noonan syndrome 3
* RAB23-related Carpenter syndrome
* Syndactyly type 1 (Chromosome 2q35 Duplication Syndrome)
* Tatton-Brown–Rahman syndrome
* TCF12-related craniosynostosis
* Teebi hypertelorism syndrome 1
* Trigonocephaly-short stature-developmental delay syndrome
* TWIST1-related craniosynostosis

== Diagnosis and evaluation ==
Diagnosis of scaphocephaly is with physical exam, which may show characteristic features such as an elongated head in the anterior-posterior dimension, narrow head in the lateral dimension, and bony ridge at the vertex.

Further evaluation with imaging may also be performed. Ultrasound may be used to detect fusion of the suture. CT scans may also be used to help with surgical planning and to diagnose associated hydrocephalus, which has been found to be present in 44% of cases in one study. A measure of cephalic index may also be reduced, however the reliability of measurements may not be a reliable measure.

==Classification==
Scaphocephaly can be classified into specific types, depending on morphology, position, and suture closure:
* Bathrocephaly– bulging of the mid-section of the occipital bone; also associated with isolated mendosal suture synostosis.
* Clinocephaly– flat cranium due to loss of cranial convexity; top of head is depressed inwards.
* Dolichocephaly– long and narrow head.
* Leptocephaly– synostosis extends down to the metopic suture; the head becomes narrow, but tall rather than long.
* Sphenocephaly– wedge-shaped head.
==Treatment==
This condition can be corrected by surgery if the child is young enough, typically within the first 3–6 months. The goal of treatment is to correct intracranial pressure and repair bony deformities. The decision to treat is multifactorial and should be performed at a center with an experienced craniofacial team. In addition to the primary craniofacial surgeon, team members may include audiologists, dentists, otolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, and other supporting members.

Surgery is generally aimed at removal of the fused sagittal suture to allow for lateral expansion of the skull. Surgical options include:

* Endoscopic strip craniectomy: Minimally invasive removal of the fused suture. Following surgery, patients typically wear a helmet to help shape the head. Helmets are usually worn for 3–12 months.
* Open cranial vault remodeling: Open surgical removal of the fused sagittal suture and re-shaping of the skull, generally with resorbable plates.
* Spring cranioplasty: Combination of an endoscopic strip craniectomy with placement of springs which provide continuous force for re-shaping the skull.

==Terminology==
The term, from Greek &quot;skaphe&quot; meaning &#x27;light boat or skiff&#x27; and &quot;kephale&quot; meaning &#x27;head&#x27;, describes a specific shape of a long narrow head that resembles a boat.

<text>Trigonocephaly is a congenital condition due to premature fusion of the metopic suture (), leading to a triangular forehead. The premature merging of the two frontal bones leads to transverse growth restriction and parallel growth expansion. It may occur as one component of a syndrome together with other abnormalities, or in isolated form. The term is .

==Cause==
Trigonocephaly can either occur in a syndrome or isolated, all by itself. Trigonocephaly is associated with the following syndromes: Bohring-Opitz syndrome, Muenke syndrome, Jacobsen syndrome, Baller–Gerold syndrome and Say–Meyer syndrome. The etiology of trigonocephaly is mostly unknown although there are three main theories. Trigonocephaly is probably a multifactorial congenital condition, but due to limited proof of these theories this cannot safely be concluded.

===Intrinsic bone malformation===
The first theory assumes that the origin of pathological synostosis lies within disturbed bone formation early on in the pregnancy. Causes can either be genetic (9p22–24, 11q23, 22q11, FGFR1 mutation), metabolic (TSH suppletion in hypothyroidism) or pharmaceutical (valproate in epilepsy).

===Fetal-head constraint===
The second theory says that synostosis begins when the fetal head gets hindered in the pelvic outlet during birth.

===Intrinsic brain malformation===
The third theory predominates disturbed brain formation of the two frontal lobes as the main issue behind synostosis. Limited growth of the frontal lobes leads to an absence of stimuli for cranial growth, therefore causing premature fusion of the metopic suture.

=== Other conditions and syndromes ===

Other conditions and syndromes with trigonocephaly include:

* Arthrogryposis, cleft palate, craniosynostosis, and impaired intellectual development
* Atypical glycine encephalopathy
* Blepharophimosis-intellectual disability syndrome, Verloes type
* Bohring-Opitz syndrome
* Coffin-Siris syndrome
* Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome
* Holoprosencephaly
* Mandibulofacial dysostosis-microcephaly syndrome
* MEGF8-related Carpenter syndrome
* Microcephaly, primary autosomal dominant
* Mucolipidosis type II
* Orofaciodigital syndrome type 14
* Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia
* Potocki-Lupski syndrome
* Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1
* Trichothiodystrophy, photosensitive
* Trigonocephaly-bifid nose-acral anomalies syndrome

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis can be characterized by typical facial and cranial deformities.

Observatory signs of trigonocephaly are:
* a triangular forehead seen from top view leading to a smaller anterior cranial fossa
* a visible and palpable midline ridge
* hypotelorism inducing ethmoidal hypoplasia

Imaging techniques (3D-CT, röntgenography, MRI) show:
* epicanthal folds in limited cases
* teardrop-shaped orbits angulated towards the midline of the forehead (&#x27;surprised coon&#x27; sign) in severe cases
* a contrast difference between a röntgenograph of a normal and a trigonocephalic skull
* anterior curving of the metopic suture seen from lateral view of the cranium on a röntgenograph
* a normal cephalic index (maximum cranium width / maximum cranium length) however, there is bitemporal shortening and biparietal broadening

The neuropsychological development is not always affected. These effects are only visible in a small percentage of children with trigonocephaly or other suture synostoses.

Neuropsychological signs are:
* problems in behaviour, speech and language
* mental retardation
* neurodevelopmental delays such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and conduct disorder (CD). Many of these delays become evident at school age.

==Treatment==
Treatment is surgical with attention to form and volume. Surgery usually takes place before the age of one since it has been reported that the intellectual outcome is better.

===Fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling===
A form of surgery is the so-called fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling. Firstly, the supraorbital bar is remodelled by a wired greenstick fracture to straighten it. Secondly, the supraorbital bar is moved 2 cm. forward and fixed only to the frontal process of the zygoma without fixation to the cranium. Lastly, the frontal bone is divided into two, rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar causing a nude area (craniectomy) between the parietal bone and frontal bone. Bone will eventually regenerate since the dura mater lies underneath (the dura mater has osteogenic capabilities). This results in an advancement and straightening of the forehead.

===&#x27;Floating forehead technique&#x27;===
The so-called &#x27;floating forehead technique&#x27; combined with the remodelling of the supraorbital bar is derived from the fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling. The supraorbital bar is remodelled as described above. The frontal bone is split in two pieces. Instead of using both pieces as in fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling, only one piece is rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar. This technique also leaves a craniectomy behind.

===Other===
* Suturectomy

* Distraction osteogenesis

* Minimal invasive endoscopic surgery

These approaches are 2D solutions for a 3D problem, therefore the results are not optimal. Distraction osteogenesis and minimal invasive endoscopic surgery are yet in experimental phase.

==Outcomes==

===Surgical===
Trigonocephaly seems to be the most compliant form of craniosynostosis for surgery. Because of standardization of current surgical approaches there is no surgical mortality and complications are few to none.
The simple suturectomy is presently insufficient to adjust the complicated growth restrictions caused by metopic synostosis. On the other hand, the fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling and the &#x27;floating forehead technique&#x27; create sufficient space for brain growth and result in a normal horizontal axis of the orbits and supraorbital bar. The fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling is the most used method nowadays.
Over the past few years distraction osteogenesis has been gradually acknowledged since it has a positive effect on hypotelorism. Expanding the distance between the orbits using springs seems to be successful. However, there are discussions whether hypotelorism really needs to be corrected.
The minimal invasive endoscopic surgery has been gaining attention since the early &#x27;90s, however, it has technical limitations (only strip craniectomy is possible). Attempts have been made to reach beyond these limits.

===Aesthetic===
Aesthetic outcome of metopic synostosis surgery is persistently good with reoperation hazards below 20%. In 1981 Anderson advised &quot;that craniofacial operations for synostosis should be as extensive as necessary&quot; after a study of 107 cases of metopic and coronal synostosis. Surgery does not provide a 100% natural outcome, mostly there will be minor irregularities. Reoperations are usually performed on more severe cases (including syndromic metopic synostosis). The hypotelorism and temporal hollowing are the most difficult to correct: the hypotelorism usually remains under corrected and a second operation is often needed for correction of temporal hollowing.

===Neurological===
The highest rate of neurological problems of single suture synostosis are seen in patients with trigonocephaly. Surgery is performed generally before the age of one because of claims of better intellectual outcome. Seemingly surgery does not influence the high incidence of neurodevelopment problems in patients with metopic synostosis. Neurological disorders such as ADHD, ASD, ODD and CD are seen in patients with trigonocephaly. These disorders are usually also associated with decreased IQ. The presence of ADHD, ASD and ODD is higher in cases with an IQ below 85. This is not the case with CD which showed an insignificant increase at an IQ below 85.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of metopic synostosis is roughly between 1:700 and 1:15,000 newborns globally (differs per country). Trigonocephaly is seen more in males than females ranging from 2:1 to 6.5:1. Hereditary relations in metopic synostosis have been found of which 5.5% were well defined syndromic. Maternal age and a birth weight of less than 2500g may also play a role in trigonocephaly. These data are based on estimations and do not give factual information.

Only one article gives valuable and reliable information regarding the incidence of metopic synostosis in the Netherlands. The incidence in the Netherlands showed an increase from 0.6 (1997) to 1.9 (2007) for every 10,000 live births.

==History==
In former times people born with malformed skulls were rejected based upon their appearance. This still persists today in various parts of the world even though the intellectual development is often normal. The Austrian physician Franz Joseph Gall presented the science of phrenology in the early 19th century through his work &quot;The Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System in General, and of the Brain in Particular&quot;.

Hippocrates described trigonocephaly as follows: &quot;Men&#x27;s heads are by no means all like to one another, nor are the sutures of the head of all men constructed in the same form. Thus, whoever has a prominence in the anterior part of the head (by prominence is meant the round protuberant part of the bone which projects beyond the rest of it), in him the sutures of the head take the form of the Greek letter &#x27;tau&#x27;, τ&quot;.

Hermann Welcker coined the term trigonocephaly in 1862. He described a child with a V-shaped skull and a cleft lip.

==Popular culture==
Via a photo shown on a Facebook page, the mother of a child previously diagnosed with this condition recognised the symptoms and reported them to the family involved, resulting in an immediate diagnosis that medical professionals had overlooked in all earlier consultations.

<text>Sir Joseph Austen Chamberlain (16 October 1863 – 16 March 1937) was a British statesman, son of Joseph Chamberlain and older half-brother of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 45 years, as Chancellor of the Exchequer (twice) and was briefly Conservative Party leader before serving as Foreign Secretary.

Brought up to be the political heir of his father, whom he physically resembled, he was elected to Parliament as a Liberal Unionist at a by-election in 1892. He held office in the Unionist coalition governments of 1895–1905, remaining in the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1903–05) after his father resigned in 1903 to campaign for Tariff Reform. After his father&#x27;s disabling stroke in 1906, Austen became the leading tariff reformer in the House of Commons. Late in 1911 he and Walter Long were due to compete for the leadership of the Conservative Party (in succession to Arthur Balfour), but both withdrew in favour of Bonar Law rather than risk a party split on a close result.

Chamberlain returned to office in H. H. Asquith&#x27;s wartime coalition government in May 1915, as Secretary of State for India, but resigned to take responsibility for the disastrous Kut Campaign. He again returned to office in David Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government, once again serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He then served as Conservative Party leader in the Commons (1921–1922), before resigning after the Carlton Club meeting voted to end the Lloyd George Coalition.

Like many leading coalitionists, he did not hold office in the Conservative governments of 1922–1924. By now regarded as an elder statesman, he served an important term as Foreign Secretary in Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s second government (1924–1929). He negotiated the Locarno Treaties (1925), aimed at preventing war between France and Germany, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Chamberlain last held office as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1931. He was one of the few MPs supporting Winston Churchill&#x27;s appeals for rearmament against the German threat in the 1930s and remained an active backbench MP until his death in 1937.

== Early life ==
Austen Chamberlain was born in Birmingham, the second child and eldest son of Joseph Chamberlain, then a rising industrialist and political radical, later Mayor of Birmingham and a dominant figure in Liberal and Unionist politics at the end of the 19th century. His father and mother, the former Harriet Kenrick had a baby daughter Beatrice Chamberlain who would become an educationalist. Harriet died giving birth to Austen, leaving his father so shaken that for almost 25 years he maintained a distance from his first-born son. In 1868, his father married Harriet&#x27;s cousin, Florence, and had further children, the oldest of whom, Neville, would become Prime Minister in the year of Austen&#x27;s death.

Austen was dominated by his elder sister and was therefore sent away to be educated first at Rugby School &quot;to release him from her thrall&quot;, before passing on to Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Trinity College, he became a lifelong friend of F. S. Oliver, a future advocate of Imperial Federation and, after 1909, a prominent member of the Round Table movement. Chamberlain made his first political address in 1884 at a meeting of the university&#x27;s Political Society and was vice-president of the Cambridge Union.

It would seem that from an early age his father had intended for politics to be Austen&#x27;s future path, and with that in mind, he was sent first to France, where he studied at the Paris Institute of Political Studies and developed a lasting admiration for the French people and culture. For nine months, he was shown the brilliance of Paris under the Third Republic, and he met and dined with the likes of Georges Clemenceau and Alexandre Ribot.

From Paris, Austen was sent to Berlin for twelve months, to imbibe the political culture of the other great European power, Germany. Though in his letters home to Beatrice and Neville, he showed an obvious preference for France and the lifestyle he had left behind there, Chamberlain undertook to learn German and learn from his experience in the capital of the German Empire. Among others, Austen met and dined with the &quot;Iron Chancellor&quot;, Otto von Bismarck, an experience that was to hold a special place in his heart for the duration of his life.

While attending the University of Berlin, Austen developed a suspicion of the growing nationalism in Germany based upon his experience of the lecturing style of Heinrich von Treitschke, who opened up to him &quot;a new side of the German character – a narrow-minded, proud, intolerant Prussian chauvinism&quot;, the consequences of which he was later to ponder during the First World War and the crises of the 1930s.

== Early career ==
=== Member of Parliament ===
Austen returned to England in 1888, lured largely by the prize of a parliamentary constituency. He was first elected to parliament as a member of his father&#x27;s own Liberal Unionist Party in 1892, sitting for the seat of East Worcestershire. Owing to the prominence of his father and the alliance between the anti-Home Rule Liberal Unionists and Conservatives, Chamberlain was returned unopposed on 30 March, and at the first sitting of the new session, he walked up the floor of the house flanked by his father and his uncle, Richard.

Owing to the dissolution of parliament and the 1892 general election that August, Chamberlain was unable to make his maiden speech until April 1893, but, when delivered, it was acclaimed by the four-time prime minister William Ewart Gladstone as &quot;one of the best speeches which has been made&quot;. That Chamberlain was speaking against Gladstone&#x27;s own Second Home Rule Bill does not seem to have dampened the enthusiasm of the Prime Minister, who responded by publicly congratulating both Austen and his father, Joseph, on such an excellent performance. That was highly significant, given the bad blood existing between Joseph Chamberlain and his former leader.

===Political office===

Appointed a junior Whip of the Liberal Unionists after the general election, Austen&#x27;s main role was to act as his father&#x27;s &quot;standard bearer&quot; in matters of policy. Following the Conservative and Unionist landslide win in the election of 1895, Chamberlain was appointed Civil Lord of the Admiralty, holding that post until 1900, when he became Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Lord Salisbury retired as prime minister in July 1902, and the following month Chamberlain was promoted to the position of Postmaster General by the new premier, the Conservative Arthur Balfour, who also designated this a cabinet position, and appointed him to the Privy Council.

In the wake of the struggle between his father and Balfour, Austen Chamberlain became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1903. Austen&#x27;s appointment was largely a compromise solution to the bitter division of the two Unionist heavyweights, which threatened to split the coalition between supporters of Chamberlain&#x27;s Imperial Tariff campaign and Balfour&#x27;s more cautious advocacy of protectionism. While Austen supported his father&#x27;s programme, his influence within the cabinet was diminished following the departure of the senior Chamberlain to the backbenches. Facing a resurgent Liberal opposition and the threat of an internal party split, Balfour eventually took the Unionists into opposition in December 1905, and in the ensuing rout in the election of 1906, Austen found himself one of the few surviving Liberal Unionists in the House of Commons.

After his father&#x27;s stroke and enforced retirement from active politics a few months later, Austen became the effective leader of the tariff reform campaign within the Unionist Party, and thus, he was a contender for the eventual leadership of the party itself.

== Leadership questions ==
With the Unionists in disarray after electoral defeats at both the January and December 1910 elections, Balfour was forced from his position as party leader in November 1911. Chamberlain was one of the leading candidates to succeed as Conservative leader even though he was still technically a member of the Liberal Unionist wing of the coalition (the two parties merged formally only in 1912).

Chamberlain was opposed by Canadian-born Bonar Law, Walter Long and Irish Unionist Edward Carson.

Given their standing in the party, only Chamberlain and Long had a realistic chance of success and though Balfour had intended Chamberlain to succeed him, it became clear from an early canvass of the sitting MPs that Long would be elected by a slender margin.

After a short period of internal party campaigning, Chamberlain determined to withdraw from the contest for the good of the still-divided party. He succeeded in persuading Long to withdraw with him in favour of Law, who was subsequently chosen by unanimous vote as a compromise candidate.

Chamberlain&#x27;s action, while it prevented him from attaining the party leadership and, arguably, the premiership, did a great deal to maintain unity within the Conservative and Liberal Unionist parties at a time of great uncertainty and strain.

==Irish Home Rule==
In the last years before the outbreak of World War I, Chamberlain was concerned with one issue above all others: Home Rule for Ireland. The issue that had prompted his father to leave the Liberal Party in the 1880s now threatened to spill over into outright civil war, with the government of H. H. Asquith committed to the passage of a Third Home Rule Bill. Chamberlain was resolutely opposed to the dissolution of the Union with Ireland. To the strain then was added the death of his father in July 1914, only a few days after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, which began the train of events that led to the war.

==First World War==
Pressure from the Conservative opposition, in part led by Chamberlain, eventually resulted in the formation of the wartime coalition government, in 1915. Chamberlain joined the cabinet as Secretary of State for India. Like other politicians, including Arthur Balfour and George Curzon, Chamberlain supported the invasion of Mesopotamia to increase British prestige in the region, thus discouraging a German-inspired Muslim revolt in India.

Chamberlain remained at the India Office after David Lloyd George succeeded Asquith as prime minister in late 1916, but following inquiries into the failure of the Mesopotamian campaign (undertaken by the separately-administered Indian Army) in 1915, including the loss of the British garrison during the Siege of Kut, Chamberlain resigned his post in 1917; as the minister ultimately responsible, the fault lay with him. He was widely acclaimed for such a principled act.

After Lloyd George&#x27;s Paris speech (12 November 1917) at which he said that &quot;when he saw the appalling casualty lists he wish(ed) it had not been necessary to win so many (&quot;victories&quot;)&quot; there was talk of Chamberlain withdrawing support from the government. Lloyd George survived by claiming that the aim of the new inter-Allied Supreme War Council was purely to &quot;coordinate&quot; policy, not to overrule the British generals, who still enjoyed a good deal of support from Conservatives.

Later, he returned to government and became a member of the War Cabinet in April 1918 as Minister without Portfolio, replacing Lord Milner, who had become Secretary of State for War.

Following the victory of the Lloyd George coalition in the 1918 general election, Chamberlain was again appointed to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer in January 1919 and immediately faced the huge task of restoring Britain&#x27;s finances after four years of wartime expenditure.

== Leadership ==
Citing ill health, Law retired from the leadership of the Conservative branch of the Lloyd George government in the spring of 1921. His seniority and the general dislike of Curzon, his counterpart in the House of Lords, helped Chamberlain to both succeed Law as Leader of the House of Commons and take over in the office of Lord Privy Seal. He was succeeded at the Exchequer by Sir Robert Horne; it seemed that after ten years of waiting, Austen would again be given the opportunity of succeeding to the premiership.

The Lloyd George coalition was beginning to falter, following numerous scandals and the unsuccessful conclusion of the Anglo-Irish War, and it was widely believed that it would not survive until the next general election. He had previously had little regard for Lloyd George, but the opportunity of working closely with the &quot;Welsh Wizard&quot; gave Chamberlain a new insight into his nominal superior in the government (by now, the Conservative Party was by far the largest partner in the government).

It was an unfortunate change of allegiance for Chamberlain, for by late 1921, the Conservative backbenchers were growing more and more restless for an end to the coalition and a return to single-party (Conservative) government. Conservatives in the House of Lords began, in public, to oppose the coalition, disregarding calls for support from Chamberlain. In the country at large, Conservative candidates began to oppose the coalition at by-elections, and discontent spread to the House of Commons.

In the autumn of 1922, Chamberlain faced a backbench revolt, largely led by Stanley Baldwin, designed to oust Lloyd George, and when he summoned the Carlton Club meeting 19 October 1922, of Conservative MPs, a motion was passed there for fighting the forthcoming election as an independent party. Chamberlain resigned the party leadership rather than act against what he believed to be his duty. He was succeeded by Law, whose views and intentions he had predicted the evening before the vote at a private meeting. Law formed a government shortly thereafter, but Chamberlain was not given a post, but it seems that he would not have accepted a position even if he had been offered one.

Austen and Neville Chamberlain, Iain Duncan Smith and Liz Truss are the only four Conservative leaders not to lead the party into a general election. Until William Hague (1997–2001), Austen had been the only Conservative overall leader in the history of the party not to become prime minister.

==Foreign Secretary==
=== Appointment ===

After the second resignation of Law in May 1923 (Law died from throat cancer later that year), Chamberlain was passed over again for the leadership of the party in favour of Stanley Baldwin. Baldwin offered Chamberlain the post of Lord Privy Seal, but Chamberlain insisted other former ministers from the Coalition to be included as well; Baldwin refused. However, Chamberlain returned to government when Baldwin formed his second ministry following success in the election of October 1924, serving in the important office of Foreign Secretary from 1924 to 1929. Chamberlain was largely allowed a free hand by the easy-going Baldwin.

It is as Foreign Secretary that Chamberlain&#x27;s place in history was finally assured. In a difficult period in international relations, Chamberlain faced not only a split in the &quot;entente cordiale&quot; by the French occupation of the Ruhr but also the controversy over the 1924 Geneva Protocol, which threatened to dilute British sovereignty over the issue of League of Nations economic sanctions.

=== Locarno Pact ===

Despite the importance to history of other pressing issues, his reputation chiefly rests on his part in the negotiations over what came to be known as the Locarno Pact of 1925. Seeking to maintain the postwar status quo in the West, Chamberlain responded favourably to the approaches of German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann for a British guarantee of Germany&#x27;s western borders. Besides promoting Franco-German reconciliation, Chamberlain&#x27;s main motive was to create a situation in which Germany could pursue territorial revisionism in Eastern Europe peacefully.

Chamberlain&#x27;s understanding was that if Franco-German relations improved, France would gradually abandon the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, the French alliance system in Eastern Europe between the wars. Once France had abandoned its allies in Eastern Europe as the price of better relations with Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia would have no Great Power ally to protect them and would be forced to adjust to German demands. Chamberlain believed that they would peacefully hand over the territories claimed by Germany such as the Sudetenland, the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig. Promoting territorial revisionism in Eastern Europe in Germany&#x27;s favour was one of Chamberlain&#x27;s principal reasons for Locarno.

Together with Aristide Briand of France, Chamberlain and Stresemann met at the town of Locarno in October 1925 and signed a mutual agreement (together with representatives from Belgium and Italy) to settle all differences between the nations by arbitration, not war. For his services, Chamberlain was not only awarded the Nobel Peace Prize but also made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter. He was the first ordinary Knight Companion of the Garter since Elizabethan times (Sir Henry Lee) to die without having been made a peer. He was the 871st Knight Companion of the Garter.

Chamberlain also secured Britain&#x27;s accession to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which theoretically outlawed war as an instrument of policy. Chamberlain also said that Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was &quot;a man with whom business could be done&quot;.

=== Resignation ===
After his less satisfactory engagement in issues in the Far East and Egypt and the resignation of Baldwin&#x27;s government after the election of 1929, Chamberlain resigned his position as Foreign Secretary and went into retirement.

Chamberlain briefly returned to government in 1931 as First Lord of the Admiralty in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s first National Government but soon retired later that year after his actions in regards to the Invergordon Mutiny. Many of the officers at the time state that the mutiny at Invergordon was a direct result of the action of the Admiralty under Chamberlain&#x27;s leadership who accepted the cuts in pay for the crews as a result of the Government&#x27;s need to reduce expenditure. The First Sea Lord Frederick Field was ill at the time of the incident and Chamberlain had proceeded without receiving the advice of the First Sea Lord.

== Later life ==
=== Backbencher ===
Over the next six years as a senior backbencher, he gave strong support to the National Government on domestic issues but was critical on its foreign policy. In 1935, the government faced a parliamentary rebellion over the Hoare-Laval Pact; his opposition to the vote of censure is widely believed to have been instrumental in saving the government from defeat on the floor of the House.

Chamberlain was again briefly considered in 1935 for the post of Foreign Secretary but was passed over once the Abyssinia Crisis was over for being too old for the job. Instead, his advice was sought as to the suitability of his former Parliamentary Private Secretary, now Minister for the League of Nations, Anthony Eden for the post.

=== Calls for rearmament ===
From 1934 to 1937, Chamberlain was, with Winston Churchill, Roger Keyes and Leo Amery, the most prominent voice calling for British rearmament in the face of a growing threat from Nazi Germany.

However, in 1935, Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s government produced a White Paper and announced modest rearmament. Although Baldwin would forever be condemned for his failure to rearm sufficiently, the Labour Party opposed the White Paper. Clement Attlee said:

We believe in a League system in which the whole world would be ranged against an aggressor. If it is shown that someone is proposing to break the peace, let us bring the whole world opinion against her.

Afterwards Austen Chamberlain fully supported Baldwin and severely criticised Attlee&#x27;s speech with the words:

If war breaks out, and we become involved in a struggle and if the Honourable Member for Limehouse [Clement Attlee] is sitting on the government benches while London is being bombed, do you think he will hold the language he held today? If he does he will be one of the first victims of the war, for he will be strung up by an angry and justifiably angry populace to the nearest lamp post.

In addition to speaking eloquently in Parliament on the matter, he was the chairman of two Conservative parliamentary delegations in late 1936 that met with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to remonstrate with him about his government&#x27;s delay in rearming the British defence forces. More respected than Churchill, Chamberlain became something of an icon to young Conservatives, as the last survivor of Victorian high politics.

=== Death ===
Though he never again served in a government, he survived in good health until March 1937, dying just ten weeks before his younger half-brother, Neville, became the first and only member of the Chamberlain dynasty to become prime minister.

Chamberlain died at the age of 73 in his London home, 24 Egerton Terrace, on 16 March 1937. He is buried in East Finchley Cemetery in London.

His estate was valued at probate at £45,044, a relatively modest sum for such a famous public figure. Much of his father&#x27;s fortune had been lost in a failed attempt by his younger brother Neville to grow sisal in the West Indies in the early 1890s, and unlike Neville, he never went into business to make money for himself.

His personal and political papers are housed in the Cadbury Research Library at the University of Birmingham.

== Assessments ==
Robert Blake wrote that Austen Chamberlain &quot;for all his talents was only a thin echo of his formidable father, a mere shadow of that extraordinary figure ... Austen Chamberlain was altogether kinder than his father, more likeable, more honourable, more high-minded and less effective ... he lacked that ultimate hardness without which men seldom reach supreme political power&quot;. Blake comments that he often missed his chances because he could be persuaded to back off by the suggestion that he was acting for self-seeking reasons, hence Churchill&#x27;s quip that &quot;he always played the game, and he always lost it&quot;.

David Dutton comments that early assessments of Chamberlain&#x27;s career compared him unfavourably with his father, who overshadowed his early career, and his brother, who overshadowed his later decades. In his forties, when he was ready to carve out his own identity, he had to act as a surrogate for his disabled father, whom he resembled in appearance (although he was softer and less wiry, both in face and body) and dress (wearing a monocle, and an orchid in his lapel). Until William Hague (1997–2001), he was the only Conservative leader of the twentieth century not to become prime minister. Although this is sometimes attributed to character defects, Dutton argues that he was a major figure in his own right, who only narrowly missed becoming prime minister in 1922 or 1923. Dutton quotes with approval Leo Amery&#x27;s verdict written just after Chamberlain&#x27;s death: &#x27;He just missed greatness and the highest position, but his was a fine life of honourable public service&#x27;.

Chamberlain could speak effectively, but was never a stirring orator. For most of his career he was renowned for rectitude and civic duty. Before the war Chamberlain had been a somewhat reluctant radical, but after 1918 he became more conservative, concerned at the new threat of socialism, and whose dress – he not only wore a monocle and frock coat but was one of the last MPs to wear a top hat inside the Commons Chamber – made him appear a relic from a previous generation. Dutton suggests that his &quot;exaggerated sense of his own importance and dignity which compounded an already stiff and unbending personal demeanour&quot;, came from having to serve under men – Law and Baldwin – whom he regarded as his juniors.

== Personal life ==
In 1906, Chamberlain married Ivy Muriel Dundas (died 1941), daughter of Colonel Henry Dundas. She was created a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1925. The couple had two sons, Joseph and Lawrence, and a daughter, Diane.

During the 1920s, the Chamberlains lived at a house called Twytt&#x27;s Ghyll in Fir Toll Road, Mayfield, East Sussex. The house was sold in 1929. R.C.G. Foster said, &quot;He kept himself quite aloof from the village and was not popular with his neighbours&quot;. He had an interest in rock gardening. At his death, his estate was valued for probate at £45,044 18/1.

<text>The Yellow Book was a British quarterly literary periodical that was published in London from 1894 to 1897. It was published at The Bodley Head Publishing House by Elkin Mathews and John Lane, and later by John Lane alone, and edited by the American Henry Harland. The periodical was priced at 5 shillings (£, ) and lent its name to the &quot;Yellow Nineties&quot;, referring to the decade of its operation.

==Significance==
&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; was a leading journal of the British 1890s; to some degree associated with aestheticism and decadence, the magazine contained a wide range of literary and artistic genres, poetry, short stories, essays, book illustrations, portraits, and reproductions of paintings. Aubrey Beardsley was its first art editor, and he has been credited with the idea of the yellow cover, with its association with illicit French fiction of the period. He obtained works by such artists as Charles Conder, William Rothenstein, John Singer Sargent, Walter Sickert, and Philip Wilson Steer. The literary content was no less distinguished; authors who contributed were: Max Beerbohm, Arnold Bennett, &quot;Baron Corvo&quot;, Ernest Dowson, George Gissing, Sir Edmund Gosse, Henry James, Richard Le Gallienne, Charlotte Mew, Arthur Symons, Arthur Waugh, H. G. Wells, William Butler Yeats and Frank Swettenham.

Though Oscar Wilde never published anything within its pages, the journal was linked to him because Beardsley had illustrated his &quot;Salomé,&quot; and because he was on friendly terms with many of its contributors. The magazine is also alluded to across his literature. In Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1891), a major corrupting influence on Dorian is &quot;the yellow book&quot; which Lord Henry sends over to amuse him after the suicide of his first love. In &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, the &quot;yellow book&quot; is understood by critics to be by Joris-Karl Huysmans, a representative work of Parisian decadence that heavily influenced British aesthetes like Beardsley. Such books in Paris were wrapped in yellow paper to alert the reader to their lascivious content. It is not clear, however, whether &quot;Dorian Gray&quot; is the direct source for the review&#x27;s title.

A covert allusion to the &quot;Yellow Book&quot; can also be found in Wilde&#x27;s drama, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1895). The character Mrs Cheveley states that she has &quot;never read a Blue Book. I prefer books … in yellow colours.&quot; This remark also appears to contrast the statistical and informational blue books almanacs with the artistic and literary &quot;yellow&quot; books of the 1890s. Considering the later date of this drama&#x27;s debut, 1895, than that of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, it can be inferred that it is perhaps more likely that Mrs Cheveley&#x27;s own allusion is to the actual &quot;Yellow Book&quot; magazine, as its publication began in 1894.

There were reports that Wilde was carrying a copy of the &quot;Yellow Book&quot; when he was arrested, at the Cadogan Hotel, in 1895. This report may or may not be correct, though Wilde cannot have been carrying a copy of Pierre Louÿs’s racy, yellow-bound novel &quot;&quot;, as has also been suggested, because this book was not published until 1896.

Soon after Wilde was arrested Beardsley was dismissed as the periodical&#x27;s art editor; his post taken over by the publisher, John Lane, assisted by another artist, Patten Wilson. Although critics have contended that the quality of its contents declined after Beardsley left and that &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; became a vehicle for promoting the work of Lane&#x27;s authors, a remarkably high standard in both art and literature was maintained until the periodical ceased publication in early 1897. A notable feature was the inclusion of work by women writers and illustrators, among them Ella D&#x27;Arcy and Ethel Colburn Mayne (both also served as Harland&#x27;s subeditors), George Egerton, Charlotte Mew, Rosamund Marriott Watson, Ada Leverson, Ethel Reed and the sisters Netta Syrett, Mabel Syrett and Nellie Syrett.

Perhaps indicative of &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; past significance in literary circles of its day is a reference to it in a fictional piece thirty-three years after it ceased publication. American author Willa Cather noted its presence in the personal library of one of her characters in the short story, &quot;Double Birthday&quot;, noting that it had lost its &quot;power to seduce and stimulate&quot;.

&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; differed from other periodicals in that it was issued clothbound, made a strict distinction between the literary and art contents (only in one or two instances were these connected), did not include serial fiction, and contained no advertisements except publishers&#x27; lists.

==Initial reception==

&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; brilliant colour immediately associated the periodical with illicit French novels – an anticipation, many thought, of the scurrilous content inside. The article &#x27;A Defence of Cosmetics&#x27; by Max Beerbohm appeared in the first volume, causing something of a sensation and establishing his reputation. Yet generally &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; first list of contributors bespoke a non-radical, typically conservative collection of authors: Edmund Gosse, Walter Crane, Frederick Leighton, and Henry James among others.

Upon its publication, Oscar Wilde dismissed &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; as &quot;not yellow at all&quot;. In &quot;The Romantic &#x27;90s&quot;, Richard Le Gallienne, a poet identified with the New Literature of the Decadence, described &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; as the following: &quot;&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; was certainly novel, even striking, but except for the drawings and decorations by Beardsley, which, seen thus for the first time, not unnaturally affected most people as at once startling, repellent, and fascinating, it is hard to realize why it should have seemed so shocking. But the public is an instinctive creature, not half so stupid as is usually taken for granted. It evidently scented something queer and rather alarming about the strange new quarterly, and thus it almost immediately regarded it as symbolic of new movements which it only partially represented&quot;.

==Influence of Aubrey Beardsley==
&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; owed much of its reputation to Aubrey Beardsley, who, despite John Lane&#x27;s remonstrations, repeatedly attempted to shock public opinion. Lane painstakingly perused Beardsley&#x27;s drawings before each publication, as Beardsley was known for hiding inappropriate details in his work. Throughout Beardsley&#x27;s contribution to &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, the two were caught in a game of hide-and-seek. Lane&#x27;s scrutiny of Beardsley&#x27;s drawings suggests that he wished &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; to be a publication only slightly associated with the Decadence&#x27;s shocking aesthetic. Indeed, Lane continually emphasized that he desired the work to be suitable reading material for any audience.

However, Beardsley openly mocked the Victorian artistic ideal, which he considered to be prudish and hypocritical. Beardsley&#x27;s artwork was perhaps the most controversial aspect of &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;; his style was thought to be highly unnatural and grotesque, and he was openly caricatured in contemporary periodicals.

In response, Beardsley cleverly published two drawings stylistically divergent to his own under the names Phillip Broughton and Albert Foschter in &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; third volume. While &quot;Saturday Review&quot; termed Broughton&#x27;s piece &quot;a drawing of merit&quot; and Foschter&#x27;s &quot;a clever study&quot;, they decried the drawings under Beardsley&#x27;s own name, deeming them &quot;as freakish as ever&quot;.

Beardsley&#x27;s contribution transformed &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; into a periodical associated with the more decadent attitudes of the fin-de-siecle. It was the decision of both Beardsley and Henry Harland to design the book in accordance with the French novel. This decision was the key factor in causing Beardsley&#x27;s removal from the periodical. The media reported the yellow book which Oscar Wilde carried to his trial to be &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; itself. Sally Ledger writes in &quot;Wilde Women and The Yellow Book: The Sexual Politics of Aestheticism and Decadence&quot;, &quot;[A]s far as the newspapers were concerned, Wilde was accompanied to his trial by The Yellow Book, and such media reports cemented in the cultural imagination of the 1890s an association between The Yellow Book, aestheticism and Decadence and, after April and May 1895, homosexuality&quot;. Due to Beardsley&#x27;s associations with Wilde through his illustrations of &quot;Salome&quot;, poetry contributor William Watson demanded he be fired as art editor. With this internal and (after Bodley Head&#x27;s premises were set upon by a mob who vandalised the building) external pressure, publishers removed all traces of the artist in the quarterly after Volume V, though an advertisement exists for Volume VI exhibiting his work.

According to Stanley Weintraub, &quot;The color of The Yellow Book was an appropriate reflection of the &#x27;Yellow Nineties&#x27;, a decade in which Victorianism was giving way among the fashionable to Regency attitudes and French influences; For yellow was not only the decor of the notorious and dandified pre-Victorian Regency, but also of the allegedly wicked and decadent French novel&quot;. If &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; was not as &quot;daring&quot; as its prospectus advertised, it was still a part of the vanguard of cultural debate which typified the main struggles of the &quot;Yellow Nineties&quot;. Its variegated array of contributors associated &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; with the &quot;impressionism, feminism, naturalism, dandyism, symbolism and classicism [which] all participate[d] in the politics of decadence in the nineties&quot;. Sabine Doran writes (in her &quot;The Culture of Yellow, or, The Visual Politics of Late Modernity&quot;) that &quot;from the moment of its conception, &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; presents itself as having a close relationship with the culture of scandal; it is, in fact, one of the progenitors of this culture.&quot;

==Art separate from text==
&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; has been credited as &quot;... commercially the most ambitious and typographically the most important of the 1890s periodicals. [It] gave the fullest expression to the double resistance of graphic artists against literature, and Art against commerce, the double struggle symbolized by the paired words on the contents-pages of the Yellow Books: Letterpress and Pictures, Literature and Art.&quot;

&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; contents-pages diverged from Victorian ideas concerning art, where &quot;[t]exts prescribed pictures and not the other way round&quot;. In the &quot;Illustration of Books: A Manual for the Use of Students&quot;, Joseph Pennell explains that &quot;an illustration really is a work of art ... which is explanatory&quot;. Interviewed before the appearance of &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; first publication, Harland and Beardsley rejected the idea that the function of artwork was merely explanatory: &quot;There is to be no connection whatever [between the text and illustrations]. [They] will be quite separate&quot;. The equilibrium which &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; poses between art and text is emphasized by the separate title pages before each individual work whether literary or pictorial. The use of title pages announces the piece before the viewer&#x27;s eye is allowed to glimpse it, separating the work from the other contributions and presenting each individual work as both serious and independent from the whole.

==Page layout==
&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; mise-en-page differed dramatically from contemporary Victorian periodicals: &quot;... its asymmetrically placed titles, lavish margins, abundance of white space, and relatively square page declare &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; specific and substantial debt to Whistler&quot;. The copious amount of blank space utilized by &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; brought the magazine simplicity and elegance, stylistically overshadowing the &quot;anaesthetic clutter of the typical Victorian page&quot;. The use of white space is positive rather than negative, simultaneously drawing the reader&#x27;s eye to the blank page as an aesthetic and essentially created object. The first issue of &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; prospectus introduces it &quot;as a book in form, a book in substance; a book beautiful to see and convenient to handle; a book with style, a book with finish; a book that every book-lover will love at first sight; a book that will make book-lovers of many who are now indifferent to books&quot;.

The decision to print &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; in Caslon-old face further signified the ties which &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; held to the Revivalists. Caslon-old face, &quot;an eighteenth-century revival of a seventeenth-century typographical style&quot; became &quot;the type-face of deliberate and principled reaction or anachronism&quot;. A type-face generally reserved for devotional and ecclesiastical work, its use in the pages of &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; at once identified it with the &quot;Religion of Beauty&quot;. The use of catch-words on every page enhanced &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; link to the obsolescent. Both antiquated and obtrusive, the catch-phrase interrupts the cognitive process of reading: “making-transparent ... the physical sign which constitutes the act of reading; and in doing this, catch-words participate in the ‘pictorialization’ of typography”. By interrupting readers through the very use of irrelevant text, catch-words lend the printed word a solidity of form which is otherwise ignored.

The cover for the final edition of the Yellow Book (published in April 1897) was designed by Mabel Syrett.

==Mentions in literature==

&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; is mentioned in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1915):

Maugham also wrote critically about it in his semi-autobiographical work, &quot;The Summing Up&quot; (1938), commenting &quot;If one takes the trouble to look through the volumes of &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, which at that time seemed the last thing in sophisticated intelligence, it is startling to discover how thoroughly bad the majority of its contributors were. For all their parade these writers were no more than an eddy in a backwater and it is unlikely that the history of English literature will give them more than a passing glance.&quot;

&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; is also mentioned in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Put Out More Flags&quot; (1942):

&quot;The Yellow Book&quot; was parodied in Robert Hichens&#x27;s 1894 novel &quot;The Green Carnation&quot; as &quot;The Yellow Disaster&quot; which contains a drawing by Aubrey Beardsley of the Archbishop of Canterbury sitting in a wheelbarrow consisting of just three lines to form the image. Lord Reginald Hastings (a fictional portrayal of Lord Alfred Douglas) makes the following remark, &quot;What exquisite simplicity!&quot;

In the library of the protagonist of Willa Cather&#x27;s short story, &quot;Double Birthday&quot; (1929):
John Betjeman&#x27;s poem &quot;The arrest of Oscar Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel&quot; (1937) describes Wilde as saying:
&lt;poem&gt;So you&#x27;ve brought me the latest Yellow Book:
And Buchan has got in it now:
Approval of what is approved of
Is as false as a well-kept vow.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1895) by Oscar Wilde, Mrs Cheveley (a rather immoral character) says:

The book sent by Lord Henry to Dorian Gray in Wilde&#x27;s novel (widely thought to be Joris-Karl Huysmans&#x27; ), which contributes considerably to his descent into corruption, is also described as being

<text>Catherine Cornaro (; or ; ; 25 November 1454 – 10 July 1510) was the last monarch of the Kingdom of Cyprus, also holding the titles of Queen of Jerusalem and Queen of Armenia. She became queen consort of Cyprus by marriage to James II of Cyprus, and then regent of Cyprus during the minority of her son James III of Cyprus in 1473–1474, and finally queen regnant of Cyprus upon his death. She reigned from 26 August 1474 to 26 February 1489 and was declared a &quot;Daughter of Saint Mark&quot; in order that the Republic of Venice could claim control of Cyprus after the death of her husband.

==Life==
Catherine (also known as Caterina) was a daughter of Venetian Marco Cornaro, Cavaliere del Sacro Romano Impero (Knight of the Holy Roman Empire) and . She was the younger sister of the &quot;Nobil Huomo&quot; Giorgio Cornaro (1452 – 31 July 1527), &quot;Padre della Patria&quot; and Knight of the Holy Roman Empire.

The Cornaro family had produced four Doges. Her family had long associations with Cyprus, especially with regard to trade and commerce. In the Episkopi area, in the Limassol District, the Cornaro family administered various sugar mills and exported Cypriot products to Venice.

Catherine was painted by Dürer, Titian, Bellini and Giorgione.

===Succession of James II===
On the death of the Cypriot King John II in 1458, the succession was disputed between his daughter Charlotte and her illegitimate half-brother James, who tried to seize the island. On the strength of the marriage of Louis of Savoy to Charlotte, the duke of Savoy claimed the island and Charlotte was named Queen. In 1468, Catherine, through negotiations by her father and uncle, was offered to James as his wife. The marriage was extremely advantageous to the Republic of Venice as it could henceforth secure the commercial rights and other privileges of Venice in Cyprus. The proposal was agreed to, and the contract was signed in 1468, strengthening James&#x27;s position.

===Queen consort===
Thus in 1468, James II, otherwise known as James the Bastard, became king of Cyprus. He and Catherine married in Venice on 30 July 1468 by proxy when she was 14 years old. She finally set sail to Cyprus in November 1472 and married James in person at Famagusta.

===Regent===
James died soon after the wedding due to a sudden illness and, according to his will, Catherine, who at the time was pregnant, acted as regent. As soon as the Venetian fleet sailed away a plot to depose the infant James III of Cyprus in favour of Charlotte, John&#x27;s legitimate daughter, broke out, and Catherine was kept a prisoner. The Venetians returned, and order was soon restored, but the republic was meditating the seizure of Cyprus, although it had no valid title whatever.

===Monarch===
Catherine became monarch when James III died in August 1474 after his first birthday, probably from illness, even if it was rumored that he had been poisoned by Venice or Charlotte&#x27;s partisans.
The kingdom had long since declined, and had been a tributary state of the Mameluks since 1426. Under Catherine, who ruled Cyprus from 1474 to 1489, the island was controlled by Venetian merchants.

In 1488, the republic, fearing that Sultan Bayezid II intended to attack Cyprus, and having also discovered a plot to marry Catherine to Alfonso II of Naples, decided to recall the queen to Venice and formally annex the island. In February 1489, the Venetian government persuaded Catherine to cede her rights as ruler of Cyprus to the doge of Venice—and by extension the Venetian government as a whole—as she had no heir.

On 14 March 1489, she was forced to abdicate and sell the administration of the country to the Republic of Venice.

According to contemporary chronicler Georgios Boustronios:
on 15 February 1489 the queen exited from Nicosia in order to go to Famagusta, to leave [Cyprus]. And when she went on horseback wearing a black silken cloak, with all the ladies and the knights in her company [...] Her eyes, moreover did not cease to shed tears throughout the procession. The people likewise shed many tears.

=== Later life ===
The last Crusader state became a colony of Venice, and as compensation, Catherine was allowed to retain the title of queen and was made lady of Asolo, a county on the &quot;Terraferma&quot; of the Republic of Venice in the Veneto region, in 1489. Asolo soon gained a reputation as a court of literary and artistic distinction, mainly as a result of it being the fictitious setting for Pietro Bembo&#x27;s platonic dialogues on love, &quot;Gli Asolani&quot;. Catherine lived in Asolo until 1509, when the League of Cambrai sacked the town, then fled to Venice where she lived for another year, dying on 10 July 1510. She is entombed in the Church of San Salvador in Venice.

==Legacy==
A libretto based on her life by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges formed the basis of the operas &quot;Catharina Cornaro&quot; (1841) by Franz Lachner, &quot;La reine de Chypre&quot; (1841) by Fromental Halévy, and &quot;Caterina Cornaro&quot; (1844) by Gaetano Donizetti.

The Cornaro Institute, a charitable organisation founded by the artist Stass Paraskos in the city of Larnaca, for the promotion of art and other culture, memorialised her name in Cyprus, prior to its closure by Larnaca Municipality in 2017.

In October 2011, the Cyprus Antiquities Department announced a one million euro project to restore a part-medieval mansion in Potamia said to be Catherine Cornaro&#x27;s summer palace. The project aimed to create a cultural centre in the mansion&#x27;s west wing, with the work continuing in stages for three years depending on funds. According to the &quot;Cypriot Mail&quot; however, the Cyprus Antiquities Department stated in October 2012 that there was no evidence Queen Catherine ever stayed there, with the newspaper quoting the department&#x27;s archaeological officer Evi Fiouri as saying the department has never referred to the structure as the queen’s summer palace but simply as the medieval mansion of Potamia. &quot;“As the antiquities department we never said this, it seems like it went down in tradition as this,”&quot; said Fiouri. &quot;“We don’t know how it started.”&quot;

<text>Pendragon, or  (, &quot;pen[n] dragon&quot;; composed of Welsh , &#x27;head, chief, top&#x27; and / &quot;dragon&quot;, &#x27;dragon; warrior&#x27;; borrowed from the Greco-Latin word , plural , &#x27;dragon[s]&#x27;, ) literally means &#x27;chief dragon&#x27; or &#x27;head dragon&#x27;, but in a figurative sense: &#x27;chief leader&#x27;, &#x27;chief of warriors&#x27;, &#x27;commander-in-chief&#x27;, , or &#x27;chief governor&#x27;), is the epithet of Uther, father of King Arthur in the Matter of Britain in medieval and modern era and occasionally applied to historical Welsh heroes in medieval Welsh literature such as Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd.

In the , one of the earliest texts of the Matter of Britain, only Uther is given the surname &quot;Pendragon&quot;, which is explained by the author Geoffrey of Monmouth as literally meaning &quot;dragon&#x27;s head&quot;.

In the prose version of Robert de Boron&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;, the name of Uther&#x27;s elder brother Ambrosius Aurelianus is given as &quot;Pendragon&quot;, while Uter (Uther) changes his name after his brother&#x27;s death to &quot;Uterpendragon&quot;.

The use of &quot;Pendragon&quot; to refer to Arthur, rather than to Uther or his brother, is of much more recent vintage. In literature, one of its earliest uses to refer to Arthur is in Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;Lancelot and Elaine&quot;, where, however, it appears as Arthur&#x27;s title rather than his surname, following contemporary speculation that &quot;pendragon&quot; had been a term for an ancient Welsh war-chief. In C. S. Lewis&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, the Pendragon leads a national moral struggle through the centuries; bearers of the title include Cassibelaun, Uther, Arthur, and Elwin Ransom.

Mark Twain in &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; makes various satirical and scathing remarks about &quot;The Pendragon Dynasty&quot; which are in fact aimed at ridiculing much later British dynasties. The story of &quot;The Pendragon Legend&quot; by Antal Szerb revolves around a Welsh noble family called Pendragon.

==On television==
A movie was released in 2008 entitled &quot;Pendragon: Sword of His Father&quot; by Burns Family Studios about a young Artos (Arthur) Pendragon.

In a 2020 episode of the Australian animated series &quot;Bluey&quot;, Bluey, Bingo and Bandit (voiced by David McCormack) are shopping for a Moonlight Unicorn for Muffin&#x27;s birthday. Since Bluey and Bingo are playing the &quot;quiet game&quot; and thus cannot talk for fear of losing, Bandit must guess which one to purchase through pantomiming by his daughters. After several unsuccessful attempts, a new store employee named Alfie (voiced by Robert Irwin) correctly guesses &quot;Pendragon&quot;, prompting the excited Bluey and Bingo to end the quiet game.

<doc id="232091" wikidata="Q730085" url="?curid=232091" title="Columbus Destroyers">
<text>The Columbus Destroyers were an Arena Football League (AFL) team based in Columbus, Ohio, with home games in Nationwide Arena. The team was founded in as the Buffalo Destroyers, based in Buffalo, New York, and relocated to Columbus in . They folded along with the original incarnation of the AFL following the 2008 season, after a total of ten seasons of play.

On February 7, 2019, the AFL announced that it had placed an expansion team in Columbus and once again play at Nationwide Arena. The league announced on February 22, 2019, that the team as a re-launch of the Destroyers and revealed the new logo and Matthew Sauk as the head coach.

After the 2019 season, the AFL announced that they had suspended local business operations including the Destroyers, but were looking into become a traveling league. A month later, on November 27, 2019, the league announced that they had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and were ceasing operations.

==History==
===Buffalo Destroyers (1999–2003)===
The Buffalo Destroyers began play during the 1999 AFL season, playing their home games at HSBC Arena (now known as KeyBank Center), and were owned by Buffalo-area businessman Mark Hamister. The team was founded, in part, because of fears that a lease expiration could have led to the demise or relocation of the NFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills, the city&#x27;s largest sports franchise. Those fears were unfounded as a multiyear lease deal to keep the Bills in Western New York was signed shortly thereafter and remained in effect long after the Destroyers left Buffalo (the lease was again renewed in 2012). The name &quot;Destroyers&quot; came from a naming contest and alluded to the naval ship of the same name, one of which sits outside the HSBC Arena in the nearby Buffalo Naval and Serviceman&#x27;s Park.

The Destroyers initially attracted high attendance levels, among the league&#x27;s highest, but a lack of winning early on caused attendance to decline, something from which the team never recovered. Among the members of the inaugural roster was former NFL kicker Bjorn Nittmo. The first head coach, Dave Whinham, was fired in the middle of the Destroyers&#x27; second season after an abysmal 1–17 record. Former Buffalo Bills player Ray Bentley was selected as his replacement; however, he couldn&#x27;t lead the Destroyers to a winning season. The closest he came was in 2001, when his team started 6–3 but would end the season on an 0–5 skid to just barely miss the playoffs. The team had another 6–8 season, this time enough to make the playoffs but lost in the first round, in 2002. Bentley abruptly resigned after that season to take a job in broadcasting, and Ron Selesky, a respected personnel man was hired to replace him. Selesky&#x27;s record in 2003 was a lackluster 5–11. Jerry Crafts, former Bills offensive lineman, played for the Destroyers in 2001 and served most notably as nose tackle, anchoring one of the league&#x27;s better defenses.

After the 2003 season concluded, talks of a re-location began, as the Destroyers had lost $5 million over five years, went nearly unnoticed by the media (NBC had blacked out all of their games in 2003), and suffered from a lack of local support reflected in low attendance levels that had dropped dramatically from their early highs. At the time, Destroyers owner Hamister was also in the running, along with partner Todd Berman, to buy the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL, but a deal for a state incentive package fell through and the team was instead sold to Rochester-area entrepreneur and politician B. Thomas Golisano. Shortly after the Sabres deal fell through, in September 2003, Hamister announced that he was relocating the Destroyers to Columbus, Ohio for the 2004 season.

===First iteration of the Columbus Destroyers (2004–2008)===
The Buffalo Destroyers moved to Columbus after the 2003 Arena Football League season. They played their home games in downtown&#x27;s Nationwide Arena, which they shared with the National Hockey League&#x27;s Columbus Blue Jackets. The last time the AFL played in Columbus was the expansion Columbus Thunderbolts back in 1991. After one season, they relocated to Cleveland.

The Destroyers were sold to John H. McConnell, founder of Worthington Industries and majority owner of the Blue Jackets, and accountant Jim Renacci. Also owning a stake in the team was NFL wide receiver and former Ohio State football standout Joey Galloway. Mark Hamister, who owned the team during the Buffalo tenure, initially stayed on as a minority owner, but would eventually sell his share.

The Columbus Destroyers, over their first two years, would often market people with the team who are also associated with Ohio State University football program, rather than the team itself. In the 2004 season, it relied heavily on head coach, former Ohio State coach Earle Bruce, and front office worker Chris Spielman. In the 2005 season, Spielman became head coach of the team and much of the Destroyers merchandise bore his name. However, as the 2006 season approached, the team appeared to have dropped marketing Ohio State personalities, instead promoting the Destroyers playing &quot;Fast-forward football&quot;. Afterwards, the Destroyers have enjoyed more success, finishing 7–9 in 2006 and making a run all the way to ArenaBowl XXI in 2007.

Despite high hopes the 2008 Destroyers weren&#x27;t able to capitalize on the previous two years success and finished with a 3–13 record. It was announced at the end of the season that Destroyers ownership and Doug Kay had reached a decision that he would not return as head coach.

The Destroyers&#x27; mascot&#x27;s name was Bruiser.

The Destroyers were better received in Columbus than they had been in Buffalo, as their attendance levels were some of the highest in the AFL, and they were regularly covered in the media. Home games were televised locally on Columbus Sports Network, but this coverage ceased after the network folded. All games were broadcast on their radio partner Wink 107.1 FM.

In 2009, the AFL declared bankruptcy after the owners could not agree on a new financial plan. Arena Football 1, the entity that bought the AFL out of bankruptcy in late 2009, maintained the Destroyers trademark for the next decade. When the league relaunched in 2010, it kept the brands of several of the pre-bankruptcy teams.

=== Second iteration (2019) ===
On February 11, 2019, the league announced an expansion team for Columbus that would begin play the 2019 season. On February 22, at Nationwide Arena, the AFL announced that the team would be a revival of the Destroyers, with the same logo as before in a simplified grayscale color scheme, and introduced Matthew Sauk as the new head coach.

In October 2019, the league ceased all team operations, including the Destroyers, and then filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November.

==Attempts to revive the Buffalo Destroyers==

On May 24, 2008, the Arena Football League announced that it was returning to Buffalo with a new franchise to be owned by Bills alumni Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas along with Rochester Raiders owner Bob Bartosiewicz. That team was to play in the AFL&#x27;s minor league system, af2. The team was originally scheduled to begin play in 2009, but did not materialize in time for that season. Bartosiewicz later noted in 2023 that he &quot;didn&#x27;t like what [he] was seeing&quot; in the af2 at the time and withdrew from the agreement.

In 2018, an exhibit honoring the 20th anniversary of the Destroyers&#x27; establishment went on display at the Buffalo History Museum. It was attended mostly by former front office staffers.

Though Bartosiewicz expressed interest in reviving the Buffalo Destroyers if additional partners could be brought on for the project, neither Buffalo nor Columbus was included among the 16 cities that the third iteration of the AFL would play in its inaugural 2024 season when those cities were announced in July 2023. In Buffalo&#x27;s case, the unusually high cost of worker&#x27;s compensation in the state of New York poses an obstacle, as the Albany Firebirds had to renegotiate their premium to a level that was affordable. The rights to the Buffalo Destroyers name are held as of 2025 by Stevie Johnson, a former Buffalo Bills wide receiver, who was partnering with his former teammate Fred Jackson (an Indoor Football League alumnus) and a consortium of other investors to bring an IFL team to Buffalo under the Destroyers brand.

==Memorable Destroyers moments==
First Game
* On April 30, 1999, Columbus played their first game as the Buffalo Destroyers. They lost to the New England Sea Wolves 59–26 in Marine Midland Arena in front of 13,214 fans. They finished with a 1–13 record that year, thus failing to qualify for the playoffs in their inaugural season.

First Playoff Game
* It took their second season to post a playoff position, with their only five wins coming as a five-game winning streak before dropping their season finale in San Jose. Their playoff game against the Arizona Rattlers took place on July 27, 2000, with a crowd of 9,471 at the US Airways Center (then named America West Arena, dubbed &quot;the Snake Pit&quot;) in Phoenix. The Rattlers trumped the Destroyers with a 41–34 decision and knocking Buffalo out of the playoffs.

Last Game in Buffalo
*The team hosted the New York Dragons on May 11, 2003, in front of 6,116 at HSBC Arena. The Destroyers lost the game 49–30.

Last Game as Buffalo
*In front of 9,701 fans at the Thomas and Mack Center, the team lost to the then Las Vegas Gladiators by a score of 55–38 on May 15, 2003

Move to Columbus
* The team moved to Columbus after the 2003 season. They played their first home game against the Carolina Cobras and lost 54–53 in front of a team record 17,171 fans.

Road to Arena Bowl XXI
* On July 7, 2007, they upset the heavily favored Dallas Desperados who had a regular season record of 15–1. ESPN ranked it as one of history&#x27;s top upsets.
* One week later on July 14, 2007, The Destroyers reached their first Arena Bowl after defeating the heavily favored 14–2 Georgia Force 66–56.
* On July 21, 2007, the Destroyers had a bye in the Arena Bowl playoffs, where they broke local attendance records by beating up and destroying a Ford Focus compact car. This resulted in a Columbus Dispatch front-page story on July 22, 2007, where the editors of the paper declared the team &quot;Chevy Strong.&quot;
* The playoff run ended on July 29 when they played the San Jose Sabercats in ArenaBowl XXI. After the Destroyers played great football during the first half, they seemed to lose some momentum during the second half. In the end they lost to the Cats 55–33 in front of a sellout New Orleans Arena crowd.

<doc id="232097" wikidata="Q635999" url="?curid=232097" title="Compote">
<text>Compote or compôte (French for &quot;stewed fruit&quot;) is a dessert originating from medieval Europe, made of whole or pieces of fruit in sugar syrup. Whole fruits are cooked in water with sugar and spices. The syrup may be seasoned with vanilla, lemon or orange peel, cinnamon sticks or powder, cloves, other spices, ground almonds, grated coconut, candied fruit or raisins. The compote is served either warm or cold. 

==History==
Compote conformed to the medieval belief that fruit cooked in sugar syrup balanced the effects of humidity on the body. The name is derived from the Latin word &quot;compositus&quot;, meaning mixture. In late medieval England it was served at the beginning of the last course of a feast (or sometimes the second out of three courses), often accompanied by a creamy potage. During the Renaissance, it was served chilled at the end of dinner. Because it was easy to prepare, made from inexpensive ingredients and contained no dairy products, compote became a staple of Jewish households throughout Europe. In modern French, the term refers to usually unsweetened fruit purée without fruit chunks, such as applesauce..

==Variations==
Dried fruit is often used for compote by cultures from Eastern Europe, and its syrup is also drunk as a beverage. Both are called &quot;kompot&quot;. In Mennonite culture, dried-fruit compote is known by the Plautdietch name .

The dessert may be topped with whipped cream, cinnamon, or vanilla sugar. The syrup may be made with wine, as in one early 15th-century recipe for pear compote. Other variations include using dried fruit that have been soaked in water in which alcohol can be added, for example kirsch, rum or Frontignan.2

<doc id="232099" wikidata="Q357356" url="?curid=232099" title="Jabez L. M. Curry">
<text>Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry (June 5, 1825 – February 12, 1903) was an American Democratic politician from Alabama who served in the state legislature and US Congress. He also served as an officer of the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War. He was a slave owner.

After the war, he became strongly interested in education of both blacks and whites, supporting increased access. Curry taught at the university level. He was also appointed as a diplomat to Spain, serving from 1885 to 1888, and again in 1902. In 1889, he described Reconstruction as an effort to degrade the white man and give supremacy to the &quot;negro&quot;.

== Early life ==

Curry was born in Lincoln County, Georgia, the son of planter William and Susan Winn Curry. His father was a cousin of Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar, the second president of the Republic of Texas. Lamar had married Tabitha Burwell Jordan, J.L.M. Curry&#x27;s aunt. Curry grew up in a slaveholding family in Alabama and graduated from the University of Georgia in 1843, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society. While studying at Harvard Law School, Curry was inspired by the lectures of Horace Mann and became an advocate of free universal education.
===Career===
Curry became an attorney. An owner of slaves, he served in the military and in public life. He served in the Mexican–American War of 1848. He was elected to the Alabama State Legislature, serving in 1847, 1853, and 1855. He served two terms as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives, from 1857 to 1861. After Alabama seceded with the outbreak of the American Civil War, Curry resigned from Congress and served in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States.

He was commissioned as a lieutenant-colonel in the Confederate Army, where he served as a staff aide to General Joseph E. Johnston and General Joseph Wheeler.

===Postwar career===
After the war he studied for the ministry and became a preacher, but the focus of his work was free education in the South. He traveled and lectured in support of state normal schools, adequate rural schools, and a system of graded public schools. He was president of Howard College (now Samford University), Alabama from 1865–68. He next was a professor of history and literature at Richmond College, Virginia.

From 1881 until his death Curry was agent for the Peabody and Slater Funds to aid schools in the South. He was instrumental in the founding of both the Southern Education Board and the first normal school in Virginia, now known as Longwood University.

According to Paul H. Buck in his Pulitzer-Prize winning history of the reconciliation of North and South, Curry played a major role in promoting reunification of the sections. He told the 1896 national convention of the United Confederate Veterans that their organization was not formed, &quot;in malice or in mischief, in disaffection, or in rebellion, nor to keep alive sectional hates, nor to awaken revenge for defeat, nor to kindle disloyalty to the Union.&quot; Rather their &quot;recognition of the glorious deeds of our comrades is perfectly consistent with loyalty to the flag and devotion to the Constitution and the resulting Union.&quot; The convention agreed with him and formally resolved the Confederate veteran has: &quot;returned to the Union as an equal, and he remains in the Union as a friend. With no humble apologies, no unmanly servility, no petty spite, no sullen treachery, he is a cheerful, frank citizen of the United States, accepting the present, trusting the future, and proud of the past.&quot;

Curry was appointed by President Grover Cleveland as the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Spain during 1885–1888, and by President Theodore Roosevelt as ambassador extraordinary to Spain on the coming of age of King Alfonso XIII in 1902.
Curry wrote on education, American government, and Spanish history.

Curry died on February 12, 1903, and is buried in Richmond, Virginia. His wife is buried in Talladega, Alabama, where they had earlier lived. Their home, the J.L.M. Curry House, also called the Curry-Burt-Smelley House, was designated as a National Historic Landmark and has been preserved.

== Legacy ==
During his life, Curry was awarded the Royal Order of Charles III and several honorary degrees.

The Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia was named for him posthumously in 1905, in accordance with a stipulation in a donation given that year by John D. Rockfeller, Sr. to fund the establishment of the school. In spring 2020, the university president supported a recommendation to remove Curry&#x27;s name from the school, because of his support for slavery and the Confederate cause. This reflects a shared effort on the part of the institution and the broader Charlottesville community to mitigate the stains of racism and slavery. In September the University&#x27;s board of visitors voted to remove his name from the school.

As the naming subcommittee reported, Curry&#x27;s legacy is worthy of careful scrutiny. He made pro-slavery speeches from before the Civil War and held membership in the Confederate House of Representatives. His later efforts promoted education for blacks during the Reconstruction era up through the end of the 19th century are reflective of more progressive ideals that were not shared by many of his contemporaries. He did promote a more vocational style of education for blacks than he would for whites. This approach was shared by Booker T. Washington of the Tuskegee Institute, who believed that blacks should be prepared for the work most would encounter in their rural communities of the time.

Curry Hall dormitory at Longwood University and the Curry Building at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro are also named for him.

Curry was honored early in the 20th century by one of Alabama&#x27;s two statues in the United States Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. It was sculpted by Dante Sodini in 1908, the year the state donated it to the hall. In October 2009, the state replaced the Statue of Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry with a Statue of Helen Keller of Helen Keller, activist and author. Curry&#x27;s statue was transferred to Samford University, where he had been closely involved. It was displayed in Samford&#x27;s university center until the building was closed for renovation in 2018. At that point the statue was returned to the Alabama Department of Archives and History.

<doc id="232102" wikidata="Q370906" url="?curid=232102" title="Angle of attack">
<text>In fluid dynamics, angle of attack (AOA, α, or formula_1) is the angle between a reference line on a body (often the chord line of an airfoil) and the vector representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving. Angle of attack is the angle between the body&#x27;s reference line and the oncoming flow. This article focuses on the most common application, the angle of attack of a wing or airfoil moving through air.

In aerodynamics, angle of attack specifies the angle between the chord line of the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of the root of the wing is chosen as the reference line. Another choice is to use a horizontal line on the fuselage as the reference line (and also as the longitudinal axis). Some authors do not use an arbitrary chord line but use the zero lift axis where, by definition, zero angle of attack corresponds to zero coefficient of lift.

Some British authors have used the term angle of incidence instead of angle of attack. However, this can lead to confusion with the term &quot;riggers&#x27; angle of incidence&quot; meaning the angle between the chord of an airfoil and some fixed datum in the airplane.

==Relation between angle of attack and lift coefficient ==

The lift coefficient of a fixed-wing aircraft varies with angle of attack. Increasing angle of attack is associated with increasing lift coefficient up to the maximum lift coefficient, after which lift coefficient decreases.

As the angle of attack of a fixed-wing aircraft increases, separation of the airflow from the upper surface of the wing becomes more pronounced, leading to a reduction in the rate of increase of the lift coefficient. The figure shows a typical curve for a cambered straight wing. Cambered airfoils are curved such that they generate some lift at small negative angles of attack. A symmetrical wing has zero lift at 0 degrees angle of attack. The lift curve is also influenced by the wing shape, including its airfoil section and wing planform. A swept wing has a lower, flatter curve with a higher critical angle.

==Critical angle of attack==
The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack which produces the maximum lift coefficient. This is also called the &quot;stall angle of attack&quot;. Below the critical angle of attack, as the angle of attack decreases, the lift coefficient decreases. Conversely, above the critical angle of attack, as the angle of attack increases, the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface. On most airfoil shapes, as the angle of attack increases, the upper surface separation point of the flow moves from the trailing edge towards the leading edge. At the critical angle of attack, upper surface flow is more separated and the airfoil or wing is producing its maximum lift coefficient. As the angle of attack increases further, the upper surface flow becomes more fully separated and the lift coefficient reduces further.

Above this critical angle of attack, the aircraft is said to be in a stall. A fixed-wing aircraft by definition is stalled at or above the critical angle of attack rather than at or below a particular airspeed. The airspeed at which the aircraft stalls varies with the weight of the aircraft, the load factor, the center of gravity of the aircraft and other factors. However, the aircraft normally stalls at the same critical angle of attack, unless icing conditions prevail. The critical or stalling angle of attack is typically around 15° - 18° for many airfoils.

Some aircraft are equipped with a built-in flight computer that automatically prevents the aircraft from increasing the angle of attack any further when a maximum angle of attack is reached, regardless of pilot input. This is called the &#x27;angle of attack limiter&#x27; or &#x27;alpha limiter&#x27;. Modern airliners that have fly-by-wire technology avoid the critical angle of attack by means of software in the computer systems that govern the flight control surfaces.

In takeoff and landing operations from short runways (STOL), such as Naval Aircraft Carrier operations and STOL backcountry flying, aircraft may be equipped with the angle of attack or Lift Reserve Indicators. These indicators measure the angle of attack (AOA) or the Potential of Wing Lift (POWL, or Lift Reserve) directly and help the pilot fly close to the stalling point with greater precision. STOL operations require the aircraft to be able to operate close to the critical angle of attack during landings and at the best angle of climb during takeoffs. Angle of attack indicators are used by pilots for maximum performance during these maneuvers, since airspeed information is only indirectly related to stall behavior.

==Very high alpha==


Some military aircraft are able to achieve controlled flight at very high angles of attack, but at the cost of massive induced drag. This provides the aircraft with great agility. A famous example is Pugachev&#x27;s Cobra. Although the aircraft experiences high angles of attack throughout the maneuver, the aircraft is not capable of either aerodynamic directional control or maintaining level flight until the maneuver ends. The Cobra is an example of supermaneuvering as the aircraft&#x27;s wings are well beyond the critical angle of attack for most of the maneuver.

Additional aerodynamic surfaces known as &quot;high-lift devices&quot; including leading edge wing root extensions allow fighter aircraft much greater flyable &#x27;true&#x27; alpha, up to over 45°, compared to about 20° for aircraft without these devices. This can be helpful at high altitudes where even slight maneuvering may require high angles of attack due to the low density of air in the upper atmosphere as well as at low speed at low altitude where the margin between level flight AoA and stall AoA is reduced. The high AoA capability of the aircraft provides a buffer for the pilot that makes stalling the airplane (which occurs when critical AoA is exceeded) more difficult. However, military aircraft usually do not obtain such high alpha in combat, as it robs the aircraft of speed very quickly due to induced drag, and, in extreme cases, increased frontal area and parasitic drag. Not only do such maneuvers slow the aircraft down, but they cause significant structural stress at high speed. Modern flight control systems tend to limit a fighter&#x27;s angle of attack to well below its maximum aerodynamic limit.

==Sailing==
In sailing, the physical principles involved are the same as for aircraft—a sail is an airfoil. A sail&#x27;s angle of attack is the angle between the sail&#x27;s chord line and the direction of the relative wind.

<doc id="232106" wikidata="Q182120" url="?curid=232106" title="Chondrule">
<text>A chondrule (from Ancient Greek χόνδρος &quot;chondros&quot;, grain) is a round grain found in a chondrite. Chondrules form as molten or partially molten droplets in space before being accreted to their parent asteroids. Because chondrites represent one of the oldest solid materials within the Solar System and are believed to be the building blocks of the planetary system, it follows that an understanding of the formation of chondrules is important to understand the initial development of the planetary system.

==Abundance and size==
Different kinds of the stony, non-metallic meteorites called chondrites contain different fractions of chondrules (see table below). In general, carbonaceous chondrites contain the smallest percentage (by volume) of chondrules, including the CI chondrites which, paradoxically, do not contain &quot;any&quot; chondrules despite their designation as chondrites, whereas ordinary and enstatite chondrites contain the most. Because ordinary chondrites represent 80% of the meteorites that fall to earth, and because ordinary chondrites contain 60–80% chondrules, it follows that (excluding dust) most of the meteoritic material that falls on earth is made up of chondrules.

Chondrules can range in diameter from just a few micrometers to over . Again, different kinds of chondrites contain different ranges of chondrule sizes: they are smallest in CH, CM, and CO chondrites (see meteorite classification), moderately large in CR, CV, L, LL, and R chondrites, and largest in some CB chondrites (see table). Other chondrite groups are intermediate between these.

==Mineralogy and petrology==

Most chondrules are composed primarily of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene, surrounded by feldspathic material that may either be glassy or crystalline. Small amounts of other minerals are often present, including Fe sulfide (troilite), metallic Fe-Ni, oxides such as chromite, and phosphates such as merrillite. Less common types of chondrules may be dominantly composed of feldspathic material (again either glassy or crystalline), silica, or metallic Fe-Ni and sulfides.

Chondrules display a wide variety of textures, which can be seen when the chondrule is sliced open and polished. Some show textural evidence for extremely rapid cooling from a molten or nearly completely molten state. Pyroxene-rich chondrules that contain extremely fine-grained, swirling masses of fibrous crystals only a few micrometers in size or smaller are called &quot;cryptocrystalline&quot; chondrules. When the pyroxene fibers are coarser, they may appear to radiate from a single nucleation site on the surface, forming a &quot;radial&quot; or &quot;excentroradial&quot; texture. Olivine-rich chondrules may contain parallel plates of that mineral, surrounded by a continuous shell of olivine and containing feldspathic glass between the plates; these are known as &quot;barred&quot; textures. Other observed textural features that are clearly the result of very rapid cooling are dendritic and hopper-shaped olivine grains, and chondrules that are composed entirely of glass.

More commonly, chondrules display what is known as a porphyritic texture. In these, grains of olivine and/or pyroxene are equidimensional and sometimes euhedral. They are named on the basis of the dominant mineral, i.e. &quot;porphyritic olivine&quot; (PO), &quot;porphyritic pyroxene&quot; (PP), and &quot;porphyritic olivine-pyroxene&quot; (POP). It seems likely that these chondrules cooled more slowly than those with radial or barred textures, however they still may have solidified in a matter of hours.

The composition of olivine and pyroxene in chondrules varies widely, although the range is usually narrow within any single chondrule. Some chondrules contain very little iron oxide (FeO), resulting in olivine and pyroxene that are close to forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and enstatite (MgSiO3) in composition. These are commonly called &quot;Type I&quot; chondrules by scientists, and often contain large amounts of metallic Fe. Other chondrules formed under more oxidizing conditions and contain olivine and pyroxene with large amounts of FeO (e.g., olivine with the formula ). Such chondrules are called &quot;Type II&quot;. Most chondrites contain both Type I and Type II chondrules mixed together, including those with both porphyritic and nonporphyritic textures, although there are exceptions to this.

== Formation ==
Chondrules are believed to have formed by a rapid (flash) heating (within minutes or less) and melting of solid dust aggregates of approximately Solar composition under temperatures of about 1000 K. These temperatures are lower than those under which CAIs are thought to have formed. However, the environmental setting, the energy source for the heating, and the precursor material are not known. The solar nebula or a protoplanetary environment are possible places of formation.

Proposed heating mechanisms are:
*Impacts between molten planetesimals
*Meteor ablation
*Hot inner nebula
*FU Orionis-type outburst of the early sun
*Energetic bipolar-shaped outflows
*Nebular lightning
*Magnetic flares
*Shock waves in the protoplanetary disk shocks
*Supernova radiation and shock wave

Isotope studies indicate a nearby supernova explosion added fresh material to what became the Solar System. The Ningqiang carbonaceous chondrite contained sulfur-36 derived from chlorine-36. As chlorine-36 has a half-life of only 300,000 years, it could not have travelled far from its origin. The presence of iron-60 also indicates a nearby supernova. Such proximity implies the radiation and shock wave would have been significant, although the degree of heating is not known.

In contrast, the fine grained matrix, in which the chondrules are embedded after their accretion into the chondrites parent body, is assumed to have been condensed directly from the solar nebula.

==Types==
Chondrules may be organized into textural types according to such characteristics as their appearance, color, texture, and crystalline structure.

<text>A candy cane is a cane-shaped stick candy often associated with Christmastide as well as Saint Nicholas Day. The canes are traditionally white with red stripes and flavored with peppermint, but the canes also come in a variety of other flavors and colors.

==History==
A record of the 1837 exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association, where confections were judged competitively, mentions &quot;stick candy&quot;. A recipe for straight peppermint candy sticks, white with colored stripes, was published in &quot;The Complete Confectioner, Pastry-Cook, and Baker&quot;, in 1844. However, the earliest documentation of a &quot;candy cane&quot; is found in the short story &quot;Tom Luther&#x27;s Stockings&quot;, published in &quot;Ballou&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; in 1866. Described as &quot;mammoth&quot; in size, no mention of color or flavor was provided. &quot;The Nursery&quot; monthly magazine mentions &quot;candy-canes&quot; in association with Christmas in 1874, and &quot;Babyland&quot; magazine describes &quot;tall, twisted candy canes&quot; being hung on a Christmas tree in 1882.

===Practical Application===
Peppermint is a natural animal deterrent. It is believed that peppermint candy canes were originally hung on Christmas trees to keep rodents and other small animals, including cats, from damaging Christmas trees.

===Religious affiliation===

A common story of the origin of candy canes says that in 1670, in Cologne, Germany, the choirmaster at Cologne Cathedral, wishing to remedy the noise caused by children in his church during the Living Crèche tradition of Christmas Eve, asked a local candy maker for some &quot;sugar sticks&quot; for them. In order to justify the practice of giving candy to children during Mass, he asked the candy maker to add a crook to the top of each stick, which would help children remember the shepherds who visited the infant Jesus. In addition, he used the white color of the converted sticks to teach children about the Christian belief in the sinless life of Jesus. From Germany, candy canes spread to other parts of Europe, where they were handed out during plays reenacting the Nativity. The candy cane became associated with Christmastide.
This story is likely apocryphal, with references to it not existing before the mid-20th century. 
===Production===

As with other forms of stick candy, the earliest canes were manufactured by hand. Chicago confectioners the Bunte Brothers filed one of the earliest patents for candy cane making machines in the early 1920s.

In 1919, in Albany, Georgia, Robert McCormack began making candy canes for local children and by the middle of the century, his company (originally the Famous Candy Company, then the Mills-McCormack Candy Company, and later Bobs Candies) had become one of the world&#x27;s leading candy cane producers. Candy cane manufacturing initially required significant labor that limited production quantities; the canes had to be bent manually as they came off the assembly line to create their curved shape and breakage often ran over 20 percent. McCormack&#x27;s brother-in-law, Gregory Harding Keller, was a seminary student in Rome who spent his summers working in the candy factory back home. In 1957, Keller, as an ordained Roman Catholic priest of the Diocese of Little Rock, patented his invention, the Keller Machine, which automated the process of twisting soft candy into spiral striping and cutting it into precise lengths as candy canes.

==Use during Saint Nicholas Day==
On Saint Nicholas Day celebrations, candy canes are given to children as they are also said to represent the crosier of the Christian bishop Saint Nicholas; crosiers allude to the Good Shepherd, a name sometimes used to refer to Jesus of Nazareth.

<text>The Outer Space Treaty, formally the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a multilateral treaty that forms the basis of international space law. Negotiated and drafted under the auspices of the United Nations, it was opened for signature in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union on 27 January 1967, entering into force on 10 October 1967. , 115 countries are parties to the treaty—including all major spacefaring nations—and another 22 are signatories.

The Outer Space Treaty was spurred by the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the 1950s, which could reach targets through outer space. The Soviet Union&#x27;s launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in October 1957, followed by a subsequent arms race with the United States, hastened proposals to prohibit the use of outer space for military purposes. On 17 October 1963, the U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution prohibiting the introduction of weapons of mass destruction in outer space. Various proposals for an arms control treaty governing outer space were debated during a General Assembly session in December 1966, culminating in the drafting and adoption of the Outer Space Treaty the following January.

Key provisions of the Outer Space Treaty include prohibiting nuclear weapons in space; limiting the use of the Moon and all other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes; establishing that space shall be freely explored and used by all nations; and precluding any country from claiming sovereignty over outer space or any celestial body. Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space. 
From 1968 to 1984, the OST gave birth to four additional agreements: rules for activities on the Moon; liability for damages caused by spacecraft; the safe return of fallen astronauts; and the registration of space vehicles.

OST provided many practical uses and was the most important link in the chain of international legal arrangements for space from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. OST was at the heart of a &#x27;network&#x27; of inter-state treaties and strategic power negotiations to achieve the best available conditions for nuclear weapons world security. The OST also declares that space is an area for free use and exploration by all and &quot;shall be the province of all mankind&quot;. Drawing heavily from the Antarctic Treaty of 1961, the Outer Space Treaty likewise focuses on regulating certain activities and preventing unrestricted competition that could lead to conflict. Consequently, it is largely silent or ambiguous on newly developed space activities such as lunar and asteroid mining. Nevertheless, the Outer Space Treaty is the first and most foundational legal instrument of space law, and its broader principles of promoting the civil and peaceful use of space continue to underpin multilateral initiatives in space, such as the International Space Station and the Artemis Program.

==Provisions==

The Outer Space Treaty represents the basic legal framework of international space law. According to the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), the core principles of the treaty are:
* the exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and shall be the province of all mankind;
* outer space shall be free for exploration and use by all states;
* outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means;
* states shall not place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies or station them in outer space in any other manner;
* the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes; prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations, and fortifications
* astronauts shall be regarded as the envoys of mankind;
* states shall be responsible for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities;
* states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects; and
* states shall avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial bodies.

Among its principles, it bars states party to the treaty from placing weapons of mass destruction in Earth orbit, installing them on the Moon or any other celestial body, or otherwise stationing them in outer space. It specifically limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes, and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations, and fortifications (Article IV). However, the treaty does not prohibit the placement of conventional weapons in orbit, and thus some highly destructive attack tactics, such as kinetic bombardment, are still potentially allowable. In addition, the treaty explicitly allows the use of military personnel and resources to support peaceful uses of space, mirroring a common practice permitted by the Antarctic Treaty regarding that continent. The treaty also states that the exploration of outer space shall be done to benefit all countries and that space shall be free for exploration and use by all the states.

Article II of the treaty explicitly forbids any government from &quot;appropriating&quot; a celestial body such as the Moon or a planet, whether by declaration, use, occupation, or &quot;any other means&quot;. However, the state that launches a space object, such as a satellite or space station, retains jurisdiction and control over that object; by extension, a state is also liable for damages caused by its space object.

=== Responsibility for activities in space ===
Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty deals with international responsibility, stating that &quot;the activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty&quot; and that States Party shall bear international responsibility for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities.

As a result of discussions arising from Project West Ford in 1963, a consultation clause was included in Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty: &quot;A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another State Party in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment.&quot;

=== Applicability in the 21st century ===
Being primarily an arms control treaty for the peaceful use of outer space, the Outer Space Treaty offers limited and ambiguous regulations to newer space activities such as lunar and asteroid mining. It is therefore debated whether the extraction of resources falls within the prohibitive language of appropriation, or whether the use of such resources encompasses the commercial use and exploitation. 

Seeking clearer guidelines, private U.S. companies lobbied the U.S. government, which in 2015 introduced the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015 legalizing space mining. Similar national legislation to legalize the appropriation of extraterrestrial resources are now being introduced by other countries, including Luxembourg, Japan, China, India, and Russia. In addition, the U.S. has led the creation of a series of bilateral agreements known as the Artemis Accords that seek to clarify a number of issue related to the Outer Space Treaty, including the use of space resources. This has created some controversy regarding legal claims over the mining of celestial bodies for profit.

===1976 Bogota Declaration===
The &quot;Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries&quot;, also known as the &quot;Bogota Declaration&quot;, was one of the few attempts to challenge the Outer Space Treaty. It was promulgated in 1976 by eight equatorial countries to assert sovereignty over those portions of the geostationary orbit that continuously lie over the signatory nations&#x27; territory. These claims did not receive wider international support or recognition, and were subsequently abandoned.

==Influence on space law==
As the first international legal instrument concerning space, the Outer Space Treaty is considered the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of space law. It was also the first major achievement of the United Nations in this area of law, following the adoption of the first U.N. General Assembly resolution on space in 1958, and the first meeting of the U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) the subsequent year.

Within roughly a decade of the treaty&#x27;s entry into force, several other treaties were brokered by the U.N. to further develop the legal framework for activities in space:
*Rescue Agreement (1968)
*Space Liability Convention (1972)
*Registration Convention (1976)
*Moon Treaty (1979)
With the exception of the Moon Treaty, to which only 18 nations are party, all other treaties on space law have been ratified by most major space-faring nations (namely those capable of orbital spaceflight). COPUOS coordinates these treaties and other questions of space jurisdiction, aided by the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs.

==List of parties==
The Outer Space Treaty was opened for signature in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union on 27 January 1967, and entered into force on 10 October 1967. As of March 2024, 115 countries are parties to the treaty, while another 22 have signed the treaty but have not completed ratification.

Multiple dates indicate the different days in which states submitted their signature or deposition, which varied by location: (L) for London, (M) for Moscow, and (W) for Washington, D.C. Also indicated is whether the state became a party by way of signature and subsequent ratification, by to the treaty after it had closed for signature, or by succession of states after separation from some other party to the treaty.

===Partially recognized state abiding by treaty===
The Republic of China (Taiwan), which is currently recognized by , ratified the treaty prior to the United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s vote to transfer China&#x27;s seat to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1971. When the PRC subsequently ratified the treaty, they described the Republic of China&#x27;s (ROC) ratification as &quot;illegal&quot;. The ROC has committed itself to continue to adhere to the requirements of the treaty, and the United States has declared that it still considers the ROC to be &quot;bound by its obligations&quot;.

===States that have signed but not ratified===
21 states have signed but not ratified the treaty.

<text>The Shintetsu Kobe Kosoku Line (神戸電鉄神戸高速線 &quot;Kōbe Dentetsu Kōbe Kōsoku sen&quot;) is one of two lines owned by the Kobe Rapid Transit Railway (0.4 km). It is operated by Kobe Electric Railway and has only two stations. This short stretch of track, opened in 1968 is important as it connects the Arima Line to Shinkaichi, allowing Shintetsu passengers to transfer directly to Hankyū and Hanshin trains bound for Kobe Sannomiya and Umeda (Osaka), and Sanyo line trains bound for Himeji. As it is only used by Shintetsu rolling stock, the line is narrow-gauge.

<text>is a railway station operated by Hanshin Electric Railway Co., Ltd., Hankyu Corporation and Kobe Electric Railway Co., Ltd. in the district of Shinkaichi, Hyogo-ku, Kobe opened on April 7, 1968.

Kobe Rapid Transit Railway Co., Ltd. owns the railway lines, and Hanshin, Hankyu and Shintetsu operate trains running on the lines.

Shinkaichi was originally at the heart of Kobe, but Kobe&#x27;s central business district has shifted towards Sannomiya.

All 3 railway lines that stop at this station are named Kobe Kosoku Line.

== Lines ==
Shinkaichi is served by the following railway lines and stations:

* Hanshin Railway Kōbe Kosoku Line (Tozai Line)
* Hankyū Railway Kōbe Kosoku Line (Tozai Line)
* Kobe Electric Railway Kōbe Kosoku Line (Namboku Line)
== Tozai Line (Hanshin, Hankyu) ==

=== Overview ===
Shinkaichi is the terminus for Hankyu services originating at Umeda Station as well as for select through services from the Kintetsu Nara Line. Services to and from the Sanyo Electric Railway Main Line and the Hanshin Main Line continue in either direction.

Select trains from the Sanyo Main Line continue instead to the Hankyu platforms at Kobe-Sannomiya Station.

=== Layout ===
There are two island platforms with three tracks on the second basement.


=== Gallery ===


== Namboku Line (Shintetsu) ==

=== Overview ===
Shinkaichi is the southern terminus for all services on the Kobe Electric Railway.

=== Layout ===

<text>The Hanshin Kobe Kosoku Line (阪神神戸高速線 &quot;Hanshin Kōbe Kōsoku sen&quot;) is one of three lines of the Kobe Rapid Transit Railway, operated by Hanshin Railway and Hankyu Railway. Trains from Hanshin, Hankyu and Sanyo railways enter this line.

Since the Tozai Line connects three lines, it has three termini: Nishidai in the west, Hankyu Sannomiya and Motomachi in the east. All three were opened in 1968. Tracks from the three termini meet at Kosoku-Kobe. Unlike the Namboku Line, it has standard gauge tracks, .

<doc id="232137" wikidata="Q311839" url="?curid=232137" title="Fuad I of Egypt">
<text>Fuad I ( &quot;Fu’ād al-Awwal&quot;; 26 March 1868 – 28 April 1936) was the Sultan and later King of Egypt and the Sudan. The ninth ruler of Egypt and Sudan from the Muhammad Ali dynasty, he became Sultan in 1917, succeeding his elder brother Hussein Kamel. He replaced the title of Sultan with King when the United Kingdom unilaterally declared Egyptian independence in 1922.

==Early life==
Fuad was born in Giza Palace in Cairo, the fifth issue of Isma&#x27;il Pasha. He spent his childhood with his exiled father in Naples. He got his education from the military academy in Turin, Italy. His mother was Ferial Qadin.

Prior to becoming sultan, Fuad had played a major role in the establishment of Egyptian University (now called Cairo University). He became the university&#x27;s first rector in 1908, and remained in the post until his resignation in 1913. He was succeeded as rector by then-minister of Justice Hussein Rushdi Pasha. In 1913, Fuad made unsuccessful attempts to secure the throne of Albania for himself, which had obtained its independence from the Ottoman Empire a year earlier. At the time, Egypt and Sudan was ruled by his nephew, Abbas II, and the likelihood of Fuad becoming the monarch in his own country seemed remote. This, and the fact that the Muhammad Ali dynasty was of Albanian descent, encouraged Fuad to seek the Albanian throne. Fuad also served as president of the Egyptian Geographic Society from 1915 until 1918.

==Reign==
Fuad came under consideration as a candidate for the Albanian throne, but he was ultimately bypassed in favour of a Christian ruler. He ascended the throne of the Sultanate of Egypt upon the death of his brother Hussein Kamel in 1917. In the aftermath of the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, the United Kingdom ended its protectorate over Egypt, and recognised it as a sovereign state on 28 February 1922. On 15 March 1922, Fuad issued a decree changing his title from Sultan of Egypt to King of Egypt. In 1930, he attempted to strengthen the power of the Crown by abrogating the 1923 Constitution and replacing it with a new constitution that limited the role of parliament to advisory status only. Large scale public dissatisfaction compelled him to restore the earlier constitution in 1935.

The 1923 Constitution granted Fuad vast powers. He made frequent use of his right to dissolve Parliament. During his reign, cabinets were dismissed at royal will, and parliaments never lasted for their full four-year term but were dissolved by decree.

===Creation of the Royal Archives===

Fuad was an instrumental force in modern Egyptian historiography. He employed numerous archivists to copy, translate, and arrange eighty-seven volumes of correspondence related to his paternal ancestors from European archives, and later to collect old documents from Egyptian archives into what became the Royal Archives in the 1930s. Fuad&#x27;s efforts to portray his ancestors – especially his great-grandfather Muhammad Ali, his grandfather Ibrahim, and his father – as nationalists and benevolent monarchs would prove to be an enduring influence on Egyptian historiography.

==Personal life==

Fuad married his first wife, Princess Shivakiar Khanum Effendi (1876–1947), in Cairo, on 30 May 1895 (nikah), and at the Abbasiya Palace in Cairo, on 14 February 1896 (zifaf). She was his first cousin once removed and the only daughter of Field Marshal Prince Ibrahim Fahmi Ahmad Pasha (his first cousin) by his first wife, Vijdan Navjuvan Khanum. They had two children, a son, Ismail Fuad, who died in infancy, and a daughter, Fawkia. Unhappily married, the couple divorced in 1898. During a dispute with the brother of his first wife, Prince Ahmad Saif-uddin Ibrahim Bey, Fuad was shot in the throat. He survived, but carried that scar the rest of his life.

Fuad married his second wife at the Bustan Palace in Cairo on 24 May 1919. She was Nazli Sabri (1894–1978), daughter of Abdu&#x27;r-Rahim Pasha Sabri, sometime Minister of Agriculture and Governor of Cairo, by his wife, Tawfika Khanum Sharif. Queen Nazli also was a maternal granddaughter of Major-General Muhammad Sharif Pasha, sometime Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a great-granddaughter of Suleiman Pasha, a French officer in Napoleon&#x27;s army who converted to Islam and reorganized the Egyptian army. The couple had five children, the future King Farouk, and four daughters, the Princesses Fawzia (who became queen consort of Iran), Faiza, Faika, and Fathia.

As with his first wife, Fuad&#x27;s relation with his second wife was also stormy. The couple continually fought, Fuad even forbidding Nazli from leaving the palace. When Fuad died, it was said that the triumphant Nazli sold all of his clothes to a local used-clothes market in revenge. Fuad died at the Koubbeh Palace in Cairo and was buried at the Khedival Mausoleum in the ar-Rifai Mosque in Cairo.

King Fuad&#x27;s wife lived as a widow after his death. She did not have good relations with her son. After Fuad&#x27;s death, she left Egypt and went to the United States. She converted to Catholicism in 1950 and changed her name to Mary Elizabeth. She got deprived of her rights and titles in Egypt. Once named the world&#x27;s richest and most elegant woman, she possessed one of the largest jewellery collections in the world.

==Legacy==
The Fuad (Fū’ād) (فؤاد الأول) Muslim Library in China was named after him by the Chinese Muslim Ma Songting. Muḥammad &#x27;Ibrāhīm Fulayfil (محمد إبراهيم فليفل) and Muḥammad ad-Dālī (محمد الدالي) were ordered to Beijing by the King.

<doc id="232142" wikidata="Q215182" url="?curid=232142" title="Michael Stipe">
<text>John Michael Stipe (; born January 4, 1960) is an American singer, songwriter and artist, best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the alternative rock band R.E.M.

Stipe was born in Metro Atlanta in January 1960. Due to his father&#x27;s military commission, his family moved constantly, with Stipe spending part of his childhood in West Germany before finishing high school in suburban St Louis. Stipe attended the University of Georgia in Athens, where he became involved in the local college rock and jangle pop scene. He formed R.E.M. after meeting his bandmates at the university and soon dropped out to pursue music with them. The band issued its debut single, &quot;Radio Free Europe,&quot; and subsequently signed to I.R.S. Records, meeting wide acclaim and soon great commercial success.

Possessing a distinctive voice, Stipe has been noted for the &quot;mumbling&quot; style of his early career. Since the mid-1980s, Stipe has sung in &quot;wailing, keening, arching vocal figures&quot; that R.E.M. biographer David Buckley compared to Celtic folk artists and Muslim muezzin. He was in charge of R.E.M.&#x27;s visual aspect, often selecting album artwork and directing many of the band&#x27;s music videos. Outside the music industry, he owns and runs two film production studios, C-00 and Single Cell Pictures.

As a member of R.E.M., Stipe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. As a singer-songwriter, Stipe influenced a wide range of artists, including Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and Thom Yorke of Radiohead. Bono of U2 has described his voice as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, and Yorke told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Stipe is his favorite lyricist, saying &quot;I loved the way he would take an emotion and then take a step back from it and in doing so make it so much more powerful&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Stipe was born on January 4, 1960, in Decatur, Georgia, to Marianne and John Stipe. He was a military brat; his father was a serviceman in the United States Army, having served in Korea as a helicopter pilot. The elder Stipe&#x27;s career resulted in frequent relocations for his family. His younger sister, Lynda Stipe, was born in 1962 and became the vocalist of Hetch Hetchy. Stipe and his family moved to various locales during his childhood, including West Germany, Texas, Illinois, and Alabama. In 1978, he graduated from high school in Collinsville, Illinois, in suburban St. Louis. His senior photo is pictured in the album art work of &quot;Eponymous&quot;. Stipe also worked at the local Waffle House. Previous generations of his family were Methodist ministers.

At age 14, Stipe was turned on to punk rock by an article in &quot;Creem&quot; magazine by Lisa Robinson on the CBGB scene. The article featured a photo of Patti Smith, whom Stipe came to idolize. He remembers buying her debut album, &quot;Horses&quot;, the day it came out. &quot;Since then, I never looked back.&quot;

==Career==
===Boat Of===
In the early 1980s, Stipe played in the group Boat Of with Tom Smith, who would later found the groups Peach of Immortality and To Live and Shave in LA. Also in Boat Of were Carol Levy and Mike Green.

===R.E.M.===

While attending the University of Georgia in Athens, Stipe frequented the Wuxtry record shop, where he met store clerk Peter Buck in 1980. &quot;He was a striking-looking guy and he also bought weird records, which not everyone in the store did,&quot; Buck recalled. The two became friends; they eventually decided to form a band and started writing music together, although at the time Stipe was also in a local group named Gangster. Buck and Stipe were soon joined by Bill Berry and Mike Mills, and named themselves R.E.M., a name Stipe selected at random from a dictionary. Stipe was the youngest member of the band.

All four members of R.E.M. dropped out of school in 1980 to focus on the new band. Stipe was the last to do so. The band issued its debut single, &quot;Radio Free Europe,&quot; on Hib-Tone; it was a college radio success. The band signed to I.R.S. Records for the release of the &quot;Chronic Town&quot; EP one year later. In 1983, R.E.M. released its debut album, &quot;Murmur,&quot; which was acclaimed by critics. Stipe&#x27;s vocals and lyrics received particular attention from listeners. &quot;Murmur&quot; went on to win the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Critics Poll Album of the Year over Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Reckoning&quot;, followed in 1984.

In 1985, R.E.M. traveled to England to record their third album, &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot;, a difficult process that brought the band to the verge of a break up. After the album was released, relationships in the band remained tense. Gaining weight and acting eccentrically (such as by shaving his hair into a monk&#x27;s tonsure), Stipe later identified himself as suffering from depression and exhaustion during this period, saying &quot;I was well on my way to losing my mind.&quot;

They toured in Canada and throughout Europe that year; Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time.

Bill Berry left R.E.M. in 1997, and the other members continued as a three-piece. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in 2011. Stipe confirmed in 2021 that they had no plans to reunite.

===Projects===
In September 1983, a few months after the release of R.E.M.&#x27;s debut album, Stipe participated in a low-budget, forty-five-minute Super-8 film called &quot;Just Like a Movie&quot;, shot in Athens by &quot;New York Rocker&quot; magazine photographer Laura Levine, who was a friend of the band. Those with acting roles in the film included Levine, Stipe, his sister Lynda, Matthew Sweet (who formed a short-lived duo, Community Trolls, with Michael Stipe), and R.E.M.&#x27;s Bill Berry. The film remains unreleased.

In the period between 1990 and 1992, Stipe was involved with the band Chickasaw Mudd Puppies. He co-produced and featured on their two albums: &quot;White Dirt&quot; (1990) and &quot;8 Track Stomp&quot; (1991).

Stipe had planned a collaboration with friend Kurt Cobain, lead singer of Nirvana, in 1994; this was partly an attempt to lure Cobain away from his home and his drug addiction. However, they did not manage to compose or record anything before Cobain&#x27;s death. Stipe was chosen as the godfather of Cobain and Courtney Love&#x27;s daughter, Frances Bean Cobain. R.E.M. recorded the song &quot;Let Me In&quot; from the 1994 album &quot;Monster&quot; in tribute to Cobain. In 2023, Stipe would officiate the younger Cobain&#x27;s wedding to Riley Hawk.
Stipe was once very close to fellow alternative rock singer Natalie Merchant and has recorded a few songs with her, including one titled &quot;Photograph,&quot; which appeared on a pro-choice benefit album titled &quot;Born to Choose&quot;, and they appeared live with Peter Gabriel singing Gabriel&#x27;s single &quot;Red Rain&quot; at the 1996 VH1 Honors and a few other times.

Stipe and Tori Amos became friends in the mid-1990s and recorded a duet in 1994 called &quot;It Might Hurt a Bit&quot; for the &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; motion picture soundtrack. Both Stipe and Amos decided not to release it.

In 1998, Stipe published a collection called &quot;Two Times Intro: On the Road with Patti Smith.&quot; In 2006, Stipe released an EP that comprised six different cover versions of Joseph Arthur&#x27;s &quot;In The Sun&quot; for the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief fund. One version, recorded in a collaboration with Coldplay&#x27;s Chris Martin, reached number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. Also in 2006, Stipe appeared on the song &quot;Broken Promise&quot; on the Placebo release &quot;Meds&quot;. Continuing his non-R.E.M. work in 2006, Stipe sang the song &quot;L&#x27;Hôtel&quot; on the tribute album to Serge Gainsbourg titled &quot;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&quot; and appeared on the song &quot;Dancing on the Lip of a Volcano&quot; on the New York Dolls album &quot;One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This&quot;. He recorded a song with Miguel Bosé on the album &quot;Papito,&quot; &quot;Lo que ves es lo que hay.&quot;
Stipe collaborated with Lacoste in 2008 to release his own &quot;holiday collector edition&quot; brand of polo shirt. The design depicts a concert audience from the view of the performer on stage. He appeared with Chris Martin of Coldplay live at Madison Square Garden and online to perform &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; in the 12-12-12 concert raising money for relief from Hurricane Sandy. A new recording from Stipe and featuring Courtney Love was revealed in 2013. The song, &quot;Rio Grande,&quot; is taken from Johnny Depp&#x27;s pirate-themed album, &quot;Son of Rogue&#x27;s Gallery&quot;. Stipe also created the soundtrack for &quot;The Cold Lands&quot; (2013), a film by Stipe&#x27;s friend director Tom Gilroy.

Stipe inducted the American grunge band Nirvana into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 10, 2014. He debuted his first solo composition at Moogfest in 2017. In June 2017, it was revealed that Stipe had returned to recording, acting as producer and co-writer for Fischerspooner&#x27;s single &quot;Have Fun Tonight&quot;, the lead single from their album &quot;Sir&quot;. Stipe would go on to produce and co-write the entire &quot;Sir&quot; album, released on February 16, 2018. Stipe released the solo song &quot;Future, If Future&quot; on March 24, 2018, followed by &quot;Your Capricious Soul&quot; on October 5, 2019. &quot;Drive to the Ocean&quot; was released for his 60th birthday on January 4, 2020.

Photography has long been a passion for Stipe and he has been carrying a camera with him since his teenage years when he photographed shows featuring Ramones, The Runaways and Queen. In 2018, Stipe released a book of his photography entitled &quot;Volume 1,&quot; which featured 35 photographs of such celebrities as River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain. A second volume with Douglas Coupland, &quot;Our Interference Times: A Visual Record&quot;, was released in 2019.

In 2019, Stipe collaborated with Aaron Dessner and Justin Vernon&#x27;s band Big Red Machine on the single &quot;No Time For Love Like Now.&quot; The song was finished and released in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stipe began recording his first solo album at Electric Lady Studios in New York City in 2023, writing and producing &quot;synth-infused, poppy&quot; songs with longtime collaborator Andy LeMaster.

===Film and television work===
In early 1987, Stipe and Jim McKay co-founded C-00 Films, a mixed-media company that was &quot;designed to channel its founder&#x27;s creative talents towards the creation and promotion of alternative film works.&quot; Stipe and his producing partner, Sandy Stern, have served as executive producers on films including &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;. He was also credited as a producer of the 2004 film &quot;Saved!&quot;

In 1998, he worked on Single Cell Pictures, a film production company that released several arthouse/indie movies.

Stipe has made a number of acting appearances on film and on television. He appeared in an episode of &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; as an ice cream man named Captain Scrummy.

Stipe has appeared as himself with R.E.M. on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, playing a reworked version of &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; titled &quot;Furry Happy Monsters&quot;, and appeared in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Homer the Moe&quot;, in which R.E.M. was tricked into playing a show in Homer Simpson&#x27;s garage. He also appeared as a guest on the Cartoon Network talk show spoof &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; in the episode &quot;Hungry&quot;. Stipe made several short appearances on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;.

Stipe voiced Schnitzel the Reindeer in the 1999 movie &quot;Olive, the Other Reindeer&quot; and appeared in the 1996 film &quot;Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day&quot;.

===Political activism===

In March 2006, Stipe, along with other musicians, held a protest concert against the Iraq War.
In March 2018, Stipe joined the &quot;March for Our Lives&quot; rallies to advocate gun control after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. He also released a teaser of his new song in the rally.

In a 2021 interview for &quot;Jacobin&quot;, Stipe described himself as a democratic socialist, and said that he was a member of the Democratic Party so he could vote in Democratic primaries. He endorsed Bernie Sanders&#x27; 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.

Stipe expressed solidarity with the people of the Gaza Strip during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. He signed an October 2023 open letter of artists to President Joe Biden urging a ceasefire in Gaza.

==Personal life==
Stipe is vegetarian and co-owned a vegetarian restaurant, Guaranteed, in Athens, Georgia. Though many people think he also owned The Grit, he was the landlord of the building and not the restaurant owner. He lives with his long-term partner, photographer Thomas Dozol, in New York and Berlin.

In 1983, Stipe met Natalie Merchant of the band 10,000 Maniacs; the two started a friendship, and eventually had a romantic relationship for a period of time.

With the success of the albums &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1991) and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; (1992), R.E.M. became mainstream music stars. Around 1992, rumors that Stipe had contracted HIV began to circulate. He responded with the following:

In 1994, with questions remaining, Stipe described himself as &quot;an equal opportunity lech,&quot; and said he did not define himself as gay, straight or bisexual, but that he was attracted to, and had relationships with, both men and women. In 1995, he appeared on the cover of &quot;Out&quot; magazine. Stipe described himself as a &quot;queer artist&quot; in &quot;Time&quot; in 2001 and revealed that he had been in a relationship with &quot;an amazing man&quot; for three years at that point. Stipe reiterated this in a 2004 interview with &quot;Butt&quot; magazine. When asked if he ever declares himself as gay, Stipe stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t. I think there&#x27;s a line drawn between gay and queer, and for me, queer describes something that&#x27;s more inclusive of the grey areas.&quot;

In 1999, author Douglas A. Martin published a novel, &quot;Outline of My Lover&quot;, in which the narrator has a six-year romantic relationship with the unnamed lead singer of a successful Athens, Georgia-based, rock band; the book was widely speculated, and later confirmed by its author, to have been a roman à clef based on a real relationship between Martin and Stipe. The two had previously collaborated on two books, both in 1998: &quot;The Haiku Year&quot; (for which the two had both contributed haiku) and Martin&#x27;s book of poetry &quot;Servicing the Salamander&quot; (for which Stipe took the cover photograph).

==Musical style==

Stipe has a baritone vocal range. His role in the songwriting process for R.E.M. was to write lyrics and devise melodies. While each member was given an equal vote in the songwriting process, Peter Buck has conceded that Stipe, as the band&#x27;s lyricist, could rarely be persuaded to follow an idea he did not favor. Stipe sings in &quot;wailing, keening, arching vocal figures&quot; that R.E.M. biographer David Buckley compared to Celtic folk artists and Muslim muezzin. Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; in the chorus for &quot;Stand&quot;, Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue. Early articles about the band focused on Stipe&#x27;s singing style (described as &quot;mumbling&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable. Stipe commented in 1984, &quot;It&#x27;s just the way I sing. If I tried to control it, it would be pretty false.&quot;
Stipe has earned recognition from the music industry for his unique voice. Bono remarked in 2003 that Stipe has an &quot;extraordinary voice,&quot; adding &quot;I often tell him I think he&#x27;s a crooner, and he doesn&#x27;t like that very much. But it is sort of one part some sort of Bing Crosby &#x27;50s laid-back crooner, and one part Dolly Parton.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Stipe at number 152 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Stipe insisted that many of his early lyrics were &quot;nonsense,&quot; saying in a 1994 online chat, &quot;You all know there aren&#x27;t words, &quot;per se&quot;, to a lot of the early stuff. I can&#x27;t even remember them.&quot; In truth, many early R.E.M. songs had definite lyrics that Stipe wrote with care. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like &quot;simple pictures,&quot; but after a year he grew tired of the approach and &quot;started experimenting with lyrics that didn&#x27;t make exact linear sense, and it&#x27;s just gone from there.&quot; In the mid-1980s, as Stipe&#x27;s pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, &quot;After you&#x27;ve made three records and you&#x27;ve written several songs and they&#x27;ve gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes...&quot; After what Stipe has referred to as &quot;The Dark Ages of American Politics&quot; [The Reagan/Bush Years], R.E.M. incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on &quot;Document&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;. &quot;Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror,&quot; Stipe said later. &quot;In 1987 and &#x27;88 there was nothing to do but be active.&quot; While Stipe continued to write songs with political subject matter like &quot;Ignoreland&quot; and &quot;Final Straw,&quot; later albums have focused on other topics. &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; dealt with &quot;mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff,&quot; according to Stipe; &quot;Monster,&quot; meanwhile, critiqued love and mass culture, and &quot;Reveal&quot; dipped into mysticism.

<doc id="232146" wikidata="Q209529" url="?curid=232146" title="Dimitrios Gounaris">
<text>Dimitrios Gounaris (; 5 January 1867 – 28 November 1922) was a Greek politician who served as the prime minister of Greece from 25 February to 10 August 1915 and 26 March 1921 to 3 May 1922. The leader of the People&#x27;s Party, he was the main right-wing opponent of his contemporary Eleftherios Venizelos.

==Early life==
He studied law at Athens University and continued his studies in Germany, France and England, before returning to his native Patras. He was elected deputy for Achaea in 1902 and distinguished himself as an orator and a member of the so-called &quot;Japanese Group&quot; that opposed the Georgios Theotokis government in 1906–1908. Gounaris himself, however, joined the government in 1908 as Finance Minister, hoping to implement a reformist program, thereby causing the dissolution of the group, although he was soon forced to resign. Despite his progressive views (he was an admirer of the Bismarckian German social laws), his conservative political thinking turned him into a leading opponent of Eleftherios Venizelos.

==First premiership==
He was appointed Prime Minister after Venizelos&#x27; first resignation in 1915 by King Constantine I. For his anti-Venizelist, pro-neutrality role he was exiled with other prominent anti-Venizelists to Corsica in 1917 after Venizelos&#x27; return to power in Athens. He managed to escape to Sardinia, Italy, in 1918, but was able to return to Greece only in 1920, as to partake in the crucial November elections as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the &quot;United Opposition&quot;, amidst the ongoing 1919–1922 Greco-Turkish War.

==Second premiership and war against Turkey==
After Venizelos&#x27; defeat, Gounaris controlled most deputies in the parliament, and was the main driving force of the following royalist governments, but himself only assumed the office of Prime Minister in March 1921. Although he was willing to compromise with the Turks, as he showed in the London talks in early 1921, in order to step up pressure on the Kemalist Turks, he agreed to the launch of the Greek offensive of March 1921. The Greek Army was not prepared, and the attack was repulsed in the Second Battle of İnönü, resulting in the first Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War. After the successful Greek advance towards Eskişehir and Afyon in July, he urged the continuation of the advance towards Ankara, which was however stopped in the Battle of Sakarya. After the Greeks retreated to form a new front, he appealed to the Allies, and especially to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, for assistance and mediation. 

Although Gounaris threatened the British with unilateral withdrawal, his government maintained the Greek Army&#x27;s positions, not being able to shoulder the political cost of abandoning Asia Minor and the many Greeks living there to Turkish reprisals. The deepening political crisis caused the fall of Gounaris&#x27; government in May 1922, after marginally surviving a vote of confidence, but the predominance of his followers in the National Assembly meant that he only exchanged the post of Prime Minister with that of Justice Minister in the government of Petros Protopapadakis.

==Trial, execution and legacy==

After the disaster of August 1922 and the rout of the Greeks by Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s forces, the remnants of the Greek Army revolted in September, and the government was deposed. The predominantly Venizelist rebels, under the leadership of Colonel Nikolaos Plastiras, formed a military tribunal to try those that were considered as responsible for the catastrophe. The so-called &quot;Trial of the Six&quot;, convened in November 1922, found the defendants, Gounaris among them, guilty of treason. He was executed along with the others at Goudi on the same day of the verdict, on 28 November. Although Gounaris undoubtedly bears a measure of responsibility for the military and diplomatic actions that led to the Greek defeat in 1922, his trial and execution are widely perceived to be more an act of scapegoating in order to vent the anger of the people, as well as being mostly motivated by the hatred of the Venizelist faction towards him.

Gounaris together with some conservative politicians were the first to propose amendment to the Greek Constitution to allow &quot;women&#x27;s suffrage&quot; rights. The amendment ultimately failed to pass. Gounaris was the uncle of Panagiotis Kanellopoulos.

<text>Zulia State (, ; Wayuu: &quot;Mma’ipakat Suuria&quot;) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. The state capital is Maracaibo. As of the 2011 census, it has a population of 3,704,404, the largest population among Venezuela&#x27;s states. It is also one of the few states (if not the only one) in Venezuela in which voseo (the use of &quot;vos&quot; as a second person singular pronoun) is widespread. The state is coterminous with the eponymous region of Zulia.

Zulia State is in northwestern Venezuela, bordering Lake Maracaibo, the largest body of water of its kind in Latin America. Its basin covers one of the largest oil and gas reserves in the Western Hemisphere.

Zulia is economically important to the country for its oil and mineral exploitation, but it is also one of the major agricultural areas of Venezuela, highlighting the region&#x27;s contribution in areas such as livestock, bananas, fruits, meat, and milk.

==Toponymy==

There are several competing theories about the origin of the state&#x27;s name. One is that Guaimaral, son of the cacique Mara, was on pilgrimage in the Pamplona region, where he fell in love with the beautiful Zulia, but she was killed in a battle against the conquerors. Gaimaral sadly returned to his father&#x27;s domains, naming rivers, towns and regions for his lost love. There is little historical proof, but that is the most popular theory.

==History==
=== Before Colonization ===
Indigenous peoples have been living in the region for a long time, including Yukpa, Barí, Arawakos (Western), Timotes and Cuica, Caquetío, Wayúu, and Añú (es).

=== Spanish Colonization ===
The area that is now Zulia was first seen by Europeans in 1499 during an expedition commanded by Alonso de Ojeda. Transferred by the Crown of Spain to German Businessmen (to the banking company of the Welsers of Augsburg), in 1527, the Governorship and lands of the Province of Venezuela, was its factor and governor of: the Province Ambrosio Dalfinger, the first conqueror of those regions.

His expedition from Coro to Maracaibo around 1528 and 1529 and the one he carried out at the end of 1529 along the eastern shore of the lake up to the mouth of the Motatán river, were the first occasions, after the discovery, in which they made contact
the Europeans with the Indians living in Lake Maracaibo. These risky enterprises, for which a great deal of value and energy was required, were interesting subjects that inspired the chronicler Juan de Castellanos much of his poetic work concluded by the year
of 1590 under the title of &quot;Elegies of Illustrious Men of the Indies.

During the Spanish colonial period, its lands were part of the Venezuela Province until 1676, when its lands were added to the Province of Mérida del Espiritu Santo de la Grita, becoming the province &quot;Espiritu Santo de Maracaibo&quot;, or Maracaibo Province.
The territory that covers the State of Zulia was erected in the Province of Maracaibo in the year of 1678 and was added, along with Mérida, to the Viceroyalty of the New Kingdom of Granada. It is entity was governed by the President of the Court, whose official seat was the city of Santa Fé de Bogotá and its jurisdiction extended, in a capricious and extravagant way, to the Provinces of Guayana, Cumaná, Maracaibo and the Islands of Margarita and Trinidad The difficulties that to its good administration offered this curious conglomerate, forced
the Court of Madrid to modify the primitive division and by Royal Decree of September 8, 1777, the Provinces of Maracaibo, Cumaná, Guayana and the Islands of Margarita and Trinidad were incorporated into the General Captaincy of Caracas.

By Royal Decree of February 15, 1785, the city of Barinas and its dependencies, which corresponded to Maracaibo, were segregated to form a separate province, and instead the city of Trujillo was incorporated, which was part of the province of Caracas. In 1789, the province covered the territory of the current Venezuelan states of Zulia, Apure, Barinas, Táchira, Mérida and Trujillo. In 1810, Mérida and Trujillo were separated as new provinces. At the beginning of the 19th century, the province of Maracaibo had, besides the capital of its name, the cities of Mérida, Trujillo, San Cristobal, El Rosario de Perijá and San Bartolomé de Sinamaica, with their respective dependencies; but once the independence of Mérida, was segregated with the character of a province, while Maracaibo continued under the Spanish regime until January 18, 1821, on which date it joined the Great Colombia, proclaiming its independence from the Government of Madrid.

=== Republican period ===

Zulia Province declared independence from Spain on January 28, 1821. During the Gran Colombia period in 1824, it received the name of &quot;Zulia Department&quot;, honoring the Zulia River. The Constituent Congress of 1824 divided the territory of Colombia into four departments, one of which was Zulia, composed of the provinces of Coro, Mérida and Maracaibo; but when the Great Colombia was dissolved in 1830, Maracaibo was left with the character of Province composed of its own territory and that of Trujillo. One year later the Trujillo Section was erected in Province, separating definitively from Maracaibo. With the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, it was named Maracaibo Province and was one of the 11 provinces of Venezuela. In 1835 the territory of the Province of Maracaibo was divided into the five Cantons: Maracaibo, Perijá, Zulia, Gibraltar and Altagracia. By Decree of April 9, 1850 were added. the territory of the Province of Trujillo the parishes of La Ceiba and La Ceibita, belonging to Maracaibo, so that that Andean Province had an exit to the Lake.

Venezuela&#x27;s federal constitution, April 22, 1864, changed the denomination of &quot;province&quot; to &quot;state&quot;, creating the State of Maracaibo on the same territory as the province. At the end of the same year, the state&#x27;s legislation determined to change the name to the Sovereign State of Zulia, but that lasted only a few months. In 1874, its name again became Zulia State. Federal government orders in 1881 created the combined Falcón Zulia state. Its autonomous state status continued until April 1, 1890, when congress legislated the separation of the Falcon-Zulia State. It suffered further territorial changes towards the end of the 19th century, until the current delimitation in 1899 was finally drawn. Since that time the name has remained &quot;Estado Zulia&quot;.

==Geography==
The state of Zulia is a compendium of diverse geographical areas. Plains, mountains, a large lake to which about 135 rivers flow that contribute water and sediment, an infinite number of lagoons, swamps and marshes that are in the lower parts. There are very arid zones with others of great humidity, very populated zones in small spaces and other extensive semi-populated areas. Very rich areas and others of great poverty.
The Lake Maracaibo Basin covers the large to the north and west, from the Guajira Peninsula to the Perijá Mountains. Venezuela&#x27;s Andean states of Táchira, Mérida and Trujillo border Zulia State at the southern end of Lake Maracaibo.

The name &quot;Venezuela&quot; comes from the lake. When Spanish conquistadors sailed into the area, they found the indigenous peoples living in communities of huts supported by stilts along the shores of the lake. They were reminded of Venice and named the place &quot;Little Venice&quot; or &quot;Venezuela&quot;. The lake has a number of islands, some of which are populated.

Near the mouth of the Catatumbo River, where it empties into Lake Maracaibo, is the famous Catatumbo lightning (&quot;Relámpago del Catatumbo&quot;) which is represented on the state&#x27;s flag and coat of arms by lightning bolts.

Due to its geographical location, Zulia has geostrategic and geopolitical advantages combined in the diversity of resources given by the nature of its geography, geology and hydrography, drawing in its territory a heterogeneous mosaic of potentialities for the economic, social and cultural development, manifested in the practice of agriculture, livestock, forestry, mining, fishing and tourism, with areas under special administration. These elements make Zulia a federal entity capable of contributing within the economic activities, a complex industrial marked by its uniqueness, reinforced by the routes and means of lake-marine communications that facilitate the entry and exit of products and goods to the international market. Consequently, it is a nodal center of development in the western geography of Venezuela that manages and concentrates its internal flows and placed at any point of the planet by its expeditious air, land, sea and lake routes.

The state of Zulia, from the geomorphological point of view, can be defined as a depression that presents in its center a great mass of water constituted by the Maracaibo lake system, combining the heights that surround it and the flat lands that serve as coastal support. The geomorphological evolution of the state of Zulia is related to the processes generated by the collision between the South American and Pacific tectonic plates, in their interaction with the Caribbean plate. Throughout its geological history, the Andes and Perijá became positive zones; however, an orogenic pulsation in the Upper Eocene and another one during the Miocene-Pliocene defined the current form of these mountainous systems, conditioning the depression of the Maracaibo and its surrounding plains.

These orogenic processes made the Perijá mountain range suffer a less intense uplift than the Andes and, therefore, its structural pattern and relief are more moderate. Likewise, the Ziruma mountain range develops towards the southeast, considered as a pre-mountain range system of relatively lower altitudes, where only tertiary rocks emerge.
According to the most recent classification, the state of Zulia presents three basic physical-natural units: the natural region of the Perijá mountain range; the natural region of the Corian sierras and the natural region formed by the depression of the Maracaibo lake and the coastal plains of the gulf of Venezuela.

=== The Perijá mountain range ===

The natural region Cordillera de Perijá or western Andean mountain range is located in the west of Zulia state. This unit occupies an area of 4,170.55 km2, which represents 12.92% of the state. Part of the most western sectors of the Machiques de Perijá, Rosario de Perijá, Jesús Enrique Lossada, Mara and Guajira municipalities are located in this natural region.
The Perijá mountain range can be considered a horst tectonic that starts in the valley of the Intermedio river, lengthening and narrowing in a south–north direction ending in the Oca mountains, from which the lowlands of the Guajira isthmus follow.
The Perijá mountain range comprises five large landscape units:
Sierra de Motilones, Sierra de Perijá, Sierra de Valledupar, Montes de Oca and the foothills of mountains and valleys.

=== Valleys ===

Between the Perijá mountain range and the Maracaibo lake there is a wide plain, very flat, which due to its topographic differences, drainage, edaphic and vegetal formations can be differentiated in two areas: a northwest area of less flat topography, with presence of hills in some sectors, scarce hydrographic network, sandy soils and low in organic matter.

Between the southern area of the Palmar River and the northern area of the Catatumbo River, the lands are very flat and low, particularly those closest to Lake Maracaibo are flooded during rainy periods or when there is an overflow of rivers, giving rise to alluvial sandy-clay soils.

=== The Maracaibo Lake Depression ===
This natural region includes the 21 municipalities that make up the state of Zulia and occupies an area of 24,377.81 km2, representing 75.51% of the state. In the center of the depression is the engraved tectonic pit occupied by the water masses of the Maracaibo Lake system, &quot;where more than 10,000 m3 of sediments have been accumulated, whose ages are from the Cretaceous (Mesozoic) to the Recent (Cenozoic). 
These deposits of both marine and terrestrial origin contain an important accumulation of hydrocarbons that make it one of the richest oil basins in South America.

The tectonic fossa is a product of the orogenesis directly related to the uplifts of the Perijá and Andean mountain ranges that occurred during the Tertiary period (late Eocene and Oligo-Miocene), and the Falcón mountain ranges (Oligo-Miocene). This pit occupies about 12,870 km2 of surface.

=== Alluvial plains ===
This type of landscape is formed by the deposition of sediments from the rivers of the western and eastern margins of the state of Zulia, specifically in the lower courses of the rivers Limón, Guasare, Cachirí and Socuy (municipalities Mara and Jesús Enrique Lossada); the rivers Palmar, San Juan and Apón (municipalities Rosario de Perijá, Machiques de Perijá and La Cañada de Urdaneta); in the western alluvial plains, while in the eastern alluvial plains (municipalities of Miranda, Cabimas, Santa Rita and Lagunillas) they are the result of the deposition of sediments from the rivers Araure, Mene, Ulé, Tamare, Pueblo Viejo, Machango and Misoa. This landscape corresponds to flat lands, of recent origin and scarce height, which varies between 50 and 100 meters above sea level.

=== Swamps of the south of the lake of Maracaibo ===
The swampy landscape of Zulia State corresponds to the southern lands of Lake Maracaibo. They occupy an area of 1,766.53 km2, which represents 5% of the state. In this plain, the Santa Ana River system converges, formed on its left bank by the Lora and Aricuaisá Rivers, and by the Tucuco and Río Negro Rivers, in their lower course, forming highly floodable lands, generating river arms, lagoons, lakes, among which the protected area known as Ciénagas de Juan Manuel National Park stands out.

To the southeast of the Santa Ana, towards the southern area of the lake, the Catatumbo river system, to which the Socuavó, Tarra and Zulia rivers drain, also provides significant volumes of water and sediments to the marshes.
Towards the southeast of the lake, in the sector located between the Pocó and Escalante rivers, there is close contact with the northwestern Andean slope, and there is a reduced relief of excrement cones, terraces and torrential lava flows that sometimes manifest themselves in low, rounded hills.

===Climate===
In the northern sector a semi-arid climate prevails, with an irregular pluviometric regime. The annual medial precipitation registered in Maracaibo city is between , with a median temperature of . The precipitation rates increase in the western and eastern regions of Lake Maracaibo, forming a wet tropical savanna climate, with annual average temperatures from 27 °C to 28 °C, and rainfall exceeding registered in Mene Grande. In the southern lake region, increased rainfall conforms to a tropical rain forest climate with an annual average precipitation of 2,556 mm, and surpassing 3,500 mm per year in the heights of Serrania de Perija.

The geographical location and the diversity of natural landscapes present in the state of Zulia, in addition to the presence of Lake Maracaibo, define the great variety of climates present in the state. According to Koeppen&#x27;s classification, there are desert climates (Bwhi), semi-dry tropical climates (Bshi), tropical savannah and sub-humid trophy forests (Awi), tropical rainy trophy forests and savannah (Aw &quot;i), tropical rainy monsoon (Ami), tropical rainy jungle (Afi), very humid tropical temperate (Cfi), tropical humid temperate (Cwi) and undefined mountain climates.

Lake Maracaibo and its basin are factors that complement each other to produce high rainfall. However, for the specific case of the northern part of the state, the wind added to the flat relief causes dry climates, with values that vary between 200 mm and 600 mm of average annual precipitation, and a higher average annual evaporation than the precipitation, such as that which occurs in Maracaibo for the period 1993-2003 of 2,339 mm.

The distribution of precipitation in the state of Zulia is influenced by latitude, which generates an increase from north to south in the average annual precipitation of the Maracaibo (488 mm), Cabimas (528.9 mm) and Santa Barbara (1,366.5 mm) stations. This behavior is explained by the descending latitudinal order, at except for the El Tucuco station (2,032.9 mm), whose behavior is due to the altitudinal factor (205 meters above sea level), where the orography favors high rainfall.

=== Hydrography ===

The geomorphological conformation of the state of Zulia is a semicircular depression. It defines a hydrographic pattern that can be catalogued by its shape as a radial drainage, that is, that the waters coming from the water dividers are directed towards a
common outlet, Lake Maracaibo, which defines this characteristic pattern.

The Zulia hydrographic network is made up of numerous river basins and sub-basins that cover the states of Zulia, Lara, Táchira, Mérida, Trujillo and part of the Republic of Colombia, the latter drained by the Catatumbo River and its tributaries. All of them flow into the area comprised by the lake itself, the Maracaibo Strait and the El Tablazo Bay. Some sources indicate that the Maracaibo system is made up of four distinct but closely related bodies of water:
the Gulf of Venezuela, El Tablazo Bay, the Maracaibo Strait and Lake Maracaibo. Although the estuarine portion is mainly constituted by the strait and El Tablazo, it is not possible to understand the estuarine biota without taking into account the other adjacent water bodies.

The Gulf of Venezuela participates in the oceanic components, hence the importance of considering the depth, movement and chemical composition of its water body. Such physical-chemical characteristics determine the capacity to absorb and dilute the contaminating elements that may be present in this water body.
The Gulf of Venezuela, with a total surface of 17,840 km2, without including the bay of El Tablazo, is located to the north of the outer portion of the marabinal depression. Its shape is approximately rectangular, with the major axis in the northeast–southwest direction.
The outer limit of the gulf with the waters of the Caribbean Sea, on the north side, is given by a line between Punta Espada and Punta Macolla. The distance between both points is 111.12 km.

The gulf of Venezuela is a body of water that presents the following movements: of sea, of tides, marine currents and investments of water mass, which provides a high capacity to oxygenate itself and to dilute the pollutants and sediments. Scarce fluvial currents flow into this gulf, due to the arid conditions that characterize the continental territory that borders it. The most important hydrological contributions are not located in the sector of the marabine coast, but come from the mountainous system of the state of Falcon.

In the Maracaibo Lake basin, 21 major sub-basins have been identified, some of which go beyond the political-territorial limits of the State of Zulia. The most important basin is that of the Catatumbo River, with a surface of 25,708.36 km2 and represents more than a quarter (32.60%) of the total area of Maracaibo Lake Basin.

=== Soils ===
The soils of Zulia State, framed within the depression of Lake Maracaibo, are the result of the interaction of factors such as relief, climate, material
origin, vegetation and soil formation processes.

The edaphic diversity of the state of Zulia corresponds to the physiographic and climatic characteristics of the entity, hence to differentiate the types of existing soils the sectorization of the state is used, even though spatially they do not always maintain continuity, but similarity in the existing types of soil.

=== Vegetation ===

The state of Zulia, due to its great territorial extension and the great variability of type of landscapes, climate and soil, allows the existence of a great diversity of landscapes plants which, according to Huber&#x27;s classification, can be grouped into tree, shrub and herbaceous formations. Tree formations include coastal mangroves, dry to semi-deciduous lowland forests, lowland evergreen forests, and mountain forests.

It is estimated that the total area of mangroves in Zulia State occupies an area of 116.3 km2 (44.9 mi2), located in the Cocinetas, Peonias, Sinamaica and Los Olivitos lagoons, and the mouth of the Limon River. For the coastal wetlands in the entire system of Maracaibo is estimated an area of 5,683 km2 (2,194 mi2), highlighting in the south of the lake the swamps of Juan Manuel de Aguas Claras and Aguas Negras
The mangrove vegetation is rather dense. It comprises a set of predominant species, among which are: red mangrove (&quot;Rhizophora mangle&quot;), black and pink mangrove (&quot;Avicennia germinans&quot;), white mangrove (&quot;Laguncularia racemosa&quot;) and the buttonwood mangrove (&quot;Conocarpus erectus&quot;).

The category of dry semi-deciduous lowland forest occupies the largest area in the state, 18,872.7 km2 (7,286.8 mi2). These plant formations are located above the western coast, in the municipalities Paez, Mara, Maracaibo, Jesus Enrique Lossada, San Francisco, La Cañada de Urdaneta, Rosario de Perijá, Machiques de Perijá, part of Catatumbo and Jesus Maria Semprum.

On the eastern coast they are distributed in the municipalities of Miranda, Santa Rita, Cabimas, Simón Bolívar, Lagunillas and part of the municipality of Valmore Rodriguez. In the municipality of Paez, these plant formations develop in dry climates with an annual average temperature of 28 °C (82.4 °F), average annual rainfall of 125 mm to 250 mm (5 inches to 10 inches) and in Aridisols and Entisols soils. The vegetation varies in size, density and species from the coastal area to the foothills of the Oca mountains.

=== Fauna ===

The fauna is distributed according to the terrestrial or aquatic habitat of fresh and marine water, lentic and lotic waters, and also ecotone fauna.
The dry sub-region includes the municipalities of Paez, Mara, Maracaibo, Miranda, Jesus Enrique Lossada, Cabimas, La Cañada de Urdaneta and Lagunillas. This sub-region is home to vulnerable animal communities, considered to be taxa that face a high risk of extinction in the medium term. Among the different species of mammals, the palm tree bear (&quot;Myrmecophaga tridactyla&quot;), which lives especially in the northeast of the Lake Maracaibo basin, is threatened by poaching and is often rolled up on the tracks.

The cunaguaro (&quot;Leopardus pardalis&quot;), often in thorny forests, thickets and even in mangrove forests, this species - a house today - is threatened by distraction hunting; it is also destroying its habitat even though it is a species under an indefinite ban. There are others mammals in this sub-region that are at lower risk than those mentioned above, such as the endemic subspecies brownish-grey matacan deer (&quot;Mazama gouazoubira&quot;), which is distributed in arid areas and is persecuted as a source of subsistence food for its meat, which is considered to be of high quality. 
The red deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus gymnotis&quot;), subspecies that has contracted by almost 50% in the arid zones of Zulia and in the basin of the Maracaibo lake due to the indiscriminate hunting to which it has been object, given the inexistence of a specific law to protect it. The yellow bat of the deserts (&quot;Rhogeessa minutilla&quot;) is distributed in the arid and semi-arid zones of the northeast and northwest of the state of Zulia. The decrease in vegetation as a result of livestock activity has generated a destruction of their habitat.

Among the bird species, the little cardinal (&quot;Carduelis cucullata&quot;) is considered the most threatened not only in Zulia, but in the whole country. The cause of this situation is related to its capture and trade: the beauty of its plumage has been used as an ornament for hats. In less risk (prone to the effects of the activities human) stand out: the flamingo (&quot;Phoenicopterus ruber)&quot;, distributed in the swamp of
Los Olivitos, Miranda municipality, and in the Gran Eneal lagoon, Paez municipality. Although this species cannot be classified as particularly threatened, the loss of its habitats, feeding and nesting areas, together with the lack of adequate management of its shelters, has led to important studies and pro-conservation campaigns, in order to protect and ensure its integrity.

Among the reptiles, the following stand out: the coastal caiman (&quot;Crocodylus acutus&quot;), whose distribution is severely reduced at present, is located mainly in the Pueblo Viejo dam, municipality of Lagunillas. It is an endangered species, threatened mainly by the commercialization of its skin. In lesser risk is a species of turtle, &quot;Morroccoy sabanero&quot; (&quot;Geochelone carbonaria&quot;), which is distributed in dry forest areas, and is illegally extracted. Two species of indigenous reptiles are named after Zulia: a turtle (&quot;Mesoclemmys zuliae&quot;) and a lizard (&quot;Maracaiba zuliae&quot;).

In the humid and sub-humid Zulian sub-region, which includes the municipalities located to the southeast, south and southwest of Lake Maracaibo, live communities of animals that are largely the same as those living in the dry region, especially the birds. At As for mammals, there are new species, such as the spider monkey, also known as the marimonda (&quot;Ateles belzebuth hybridus&quot;), a species that lives in the humid forests of the Maracaibo Lake Basin (includes the forests of the Perijá mountain range).

In the Perijá sub-region (mountainous area), the ecosystem is made up of a great diversity of animal communities: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Representatives of some species of mammals in this subregion are: the spectacled bear (&quot;Tremarctos ornatus&quot;), which is in a category of threat (critical danger) due to the pressure exerted by the hunt, which has caused the decrease of the populations of these animals, in spite of being distributed in areas protected by the Venezuelan laws.

==Government and politics==
=== State Constitution ===
Since the creation of the Sovereign State of Zulia on February 17, 1864, with the approval of the first State Constitution, it regulates the structure and function of the government of Zulia. Like all Venezuelan State Constitutions, it is subject to national judicial review. Any of the provisions of the Constitution may be annulled if they conflict with national law and the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Constitution of the State of Zulia was promulgated on August 13, 2003, and partially amended in 2011, currently in force, thus repealing the Constitution of 1989, its partial amendment of 1993 and 2001.

=== Executive Power ===
The Executive Power is represented by the Governor of Zulia State. The Governor is elected by means of direct and secret universal suffrage of all Venezuelan citizens residing in the territory of Zulia State and registered in the Electoral Roll of the State&#x27;s circumscription. To occupy the position of Governor, it is necessary to be a Venezuelan citizen by birth and without any other nationality in full enjoyment of civil rights and older, to reside in the Federal Entity at least four years before the election according to Article 69 of the State Constitution, to be older than 25 years, not to be a minister of religious worship or to occupy positions in the national, state or municipal administration, and in case of being an official, to be separated from the position. The term of office of the state governor is four years. A governor may be re-elected an undetermined number of times.

In addition, according to the State Constitution, the Governor is accompanied in his governmental action by a Council of Secretaries starting with the General Secretariat of Government, the Secretariat of Education, the Secretariat of Infrastructure; the Secretariat of Administration, the Secretariat of Defense and Citizen Security, the Secretariat of Culture, the Secretariat of Promotion of Higher Education, the Secretariat of Health and the Secretariat of Environment, Lands and Territorial Ordering among others.

=== Legislative Power ===
The regional Parliament is represented by the Legislative Council of Zulia State, a unicameral body. It has the power to discuss and sanction the State Constitution, the laws of state competence, to reform the existing ones or to repeal those considered obsolete, in addition to approving the regional budget and supervising the action of the government. The Zulian Legislative Council is made up of 15 members called &quot;Legislators&quot;. In the last election the State was formed by 11 electoral districts. The voters of each circumscription choose the number of legislators according to the number of population living in the Municipalities according to the official census of the INE. The mandate of the legislators is for four year renewable periods, being elected by the people in accordance with the Constitution of the State and the Republic.
=== Security ===
Security and public order in the State is in charge of the Regional Police of the State of Zulia, officially known as the Corps of Police of the State of Zulia, which depends on the State Government. At the local level, most municipalities have their own police forces as a result of decentralization and based on the provisions of Article 164 of the Constitution of Venezuela of 1999 and Article 25 of the Constitution of the State of Zulia of 2003.

Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

==Municipalities and municipal seats==
The state of Zulia occupies an area of 63,100 km2, which represents a 5.50% of the national total. This area is distributed among continental, insular, lacustrine and maritime spaces. The continental space is distributed in 21 municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;), being those of greater territorial extension with respect to the state: Machiques de Perijá (18.90%), Jesus Maria Semprum (11.95%), Catatumbo (10.40%), Rosario de Perijá (7.79%) and Colón (6.71%), which occupy more than 50% of the total state area.

== Economy ==
The region has great economic resources among which are the livestock, oil, mining, agricultural and cheese production. Its economy basically depends on oil and natural gas. Oil activity has been carried out intensively since 1912, both on the mainland and in Lake Maracaibo, generating an income that exceeds the regional domain, since it is the main support of the national economy. It covers a great part of the national production of oil and hydrocarbons. Additionally, the coal mines of El Guasare are the most important in the country.

The high potential of the soils in the south of Lake Maracaibo, allow a significant agricultural and livestock development. It is the first producer of various agricultural and livestock items: oil palm, grapes, milk, cheese, cattle, sheep and poultry; the second in eggs and the third in cambur, bananas and goats. Also cultivated: sugar cane, coconut, yucca, cotton, beans, melon and sorghum. Forest production is also significant. 

The maritime resources make it the second largest supplier of fish in the country. Lake Maracaibo is fished for: bass, horse mackerel, mackerel, blue crab, small mouth, morning and sea bass, and in the Gulf of Venezuela: dogfish, horse mackerel, grouper and snapper. The shrimp was abundant in times before the 70&#x27;s, when the saturation of fishing boats began, leading to its decrease.

== Demographics ==

There is great ethnic and racial diversity in Zulia. The migration of Venezuelans from other regions and immigrants from neighboring countries in combination with indigenous communities present in Zulia has created its enormous and unique cultural richness.

=== Race and ethnicity ===
The demonym for the people of the Zulia region is Zulians.

According to the 2011 census, the racial composition of the population was as follows: 


==Notable people==

* Luis Matos (born 2002), baseball outfielder for the San Francisco Giants
* Néstor Reverol (born 1964), Minister of the People&#x27;s Power for Interior Relations and Justice of Venezuela and currently Commander General of the National Guard of Venezuela

*Gustavo Valderrama (born 1977), volleyball player

* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_AparicioLuis Aparicio (born 1934), baseball player, inducted in MLB Hall of Fame in 1984

== Sports ==
The state is home to the Gaiteros del Zulia, 4-time Champion of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto, Venezuela&#x27;s top professional basketball league. The team plays its home games at the Gimnasio Pedro Elías Belisario Aponte in Maracaibo. In baseball the state has the Aguilas del Zulia team which is affiliated to the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League and is based in the Luis Aparicio El Grande Stadium in Maracaibo. Since 2011 they have been holding exhibition games at the Victor Davalillo Stadium in Cabimas.

Among the football teams we find Zulia Fútbol Club that plays in the José Encarnación Romero Stadium (First Division of Venezuela), Deportivo JBL del Zulia (Second Division of Venezuela), Titanes Fútbol Club (Second Division of Venezuela) and Zulia Fútbol Club &quot;B&quot; (Third Division of Venezuela).

== Transportation ==

=== Roads and highways ===
The State of Zulia has one of the best road networks in the country, as befits the fact that the west of the country is located in this state.

The main roads are:

*The C1, (Highway 1): which starts from the Distributor Las Delicias in the state capital to the western head of the Rafael Urdaneta Bridge.
The Trunk 6, which connects the entire state from Castilletes to the limits of the state of Táchira, passing through Maracaibo and connecting all the western part of the state.
*Trunk 17, (Lara-Zulia Highway): which starts from the eastern head of the Rafael Urdaneta Bridge that allows communication with the state of Lara and the center-west of Venezuela.
*Trunk 3, (Falcon-Zulia): connects Zulia with the state of Falcon and the central states of Venezuela.
*Trunk 1, (Pan-American Highway): Integrates the south of the state of Zulia with Mérida and Trujillo.
*Trunk 3, (Intercommunal): that intertwines all the communities located in the Eastern Coast of the Lake of Maracaibo.

=== Air transportation ===
The main airport is La Chinita International, located in the municipality of San Francisco within the great conurbation that constitutes Gran Maracaibo, this stands out as the third most important airport in the country, with boardings of more than one and a half million passengers and allows connections with the main cities of the country such as Caracas, Valencia, Barquisimeto, Maturín, Ciudad Guayana and San Cristóbal, as well as the main tourist destinations in Venezuela such as Porlamar, Mérida and Puerto La Cruz, also have international departures to the Caribbean, North, Central and South America.

Besides the mentioned airport, the state has other air terminals located in 2 political-administrative regions such as Costa Oriental del Lago where the Oro Negro Airport is located in the city of Cabimas and in the South Zone of the Lake where the Miguel Urdaneta Fernández Airport is located in the city of Santa Bárbara del Zulia.
=== Subway ===
The Maracaibo Metro is a mass transportation system that integrates surface, air and subway modes that was inaugurated pre-operatively and free of charge to the public on November 25, 2006, while it began commercial operations three years later, on Tuesday, June 9, 2009. It is currently in the process of expansion.

=== Aquatic transportation ===
Zulia has one of the most important ports in Venezuela, Maracaibo. Historically, the western port has been one of the most important since the colonial era, due to its location and natural characteristics. The state has 83 ports of dockage emphasizing the oil terminal of La Salina and the petrochemical terminal of El Tablazo.

== Media ==
The most important newspapers produced in the region are &quot;La Verdad&quot; and &quot;Panorama&quot;, both based in Maracaibo and the latter being one of the three main newspapers of national circulation. &quot;El Regional del Zulia&quot; based in Ciudad Ojeda is also among the most read in the state.

Zulia state also has three local open signal television stations, such as NCTV (Niños Cantores Televisión, Channel 11 VHF), Televiza (Channel 7 VHF), Telecolor (Channel 41 UHF), Global TV (Channel 65 UHF) and Catatumbo Televisión (Channel 31 UHF), and cable stations such as ATEL (Americana de Televisión, as a national broadcast), and Coquivacoa Televisión, all based in Maracaibo.

On the Eastern Coast of the Lake there are Zuliana de Televisión (Channels 28 and 30 UHF), and cable channels such as TV COL (Televisora de la Costa Oriental del Lago) and Ciudad TV. In the western zone of the Perijá region are Ganadera 88.1, Sierra 99.1, Momentos 107.3, Selecta 102.7 www.selectafm.com, Oye 90.9, Fe y Alegría 105.5, Rosario 95.5, Multivision (cable operator) and Imagen TV (cable channel).

== Culture ==
=== Religion ===
The majority of the population of Zulia state is Christian which is a legacy of centuries of Spanish colonization. The largest church is the Catholic one, being the devotion to the Virgin Mary in her advocation of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá, an important annual event that is part of the Zulian culture. The state constitution guarantees freedom of worship and there are several Protestant and other religious groups.

=== Languages ===
A vast majority of Zulia&#x27;s population speaks Spanish, specifically Marabino Spanish. As with other Latin American nations, Spanish spread throughout the region during the centuries of Spanish colonization. However, there are still remnants of the languages spoken by Native American communities. Wayuu is the most widely spoken indigenous language in Venezuela with approximately 119,000 native speakers. Although this language is spoken throughout Zulia, most of its speakers live in the Guajira Peninsula which also encompasses a large territory/department in Colombia.

Other indigenous languages spoken in Zulia include Yukpa (endangered, 7500 speakers), Bari (endangered, 8000 speakers) and Japreria (critically endangered, 95 speakers).

Zulia is the only Venezuelan state where the use of voseo is widespread. Spanish and indigenous languages have been recognized as official languages by this state&#x27;s government. However, Spanish is used more often than the others by government, education, and business entities as well as the media.

=== Regional symbols ===

The state of Zulia has symbols that identify it politically, historically and culturally with the Nation and the other Federal Entities. Being the Hymn of Zulia State, elected by the then Legislative Assembly in 1909, the coat of arms of Zulia State from 1917, the Flag of Zulia State that dates from 1991 by Executive Decree of the State. They are legally established as such in the State Constitution.

=== Natural symbols ===

The state of Zulia has resources from nature that identify its beauty. These are: The Coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) is the tree that represents the beauty and richness of the Zulian flora, the Cayenne or Chinese Rose (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) and the brown pelican of the Caribbean (Pelecanus occidentalis).

<text>The theory of consumer choice is the branch of microeconomics that relates preferences to consumption expenditures and to consumer demand curves. It analyzes how consumers maximize the desirability of their consumption (as measured by their preferences subject to limitations on their expenditures), by maximizing utility subject to a consumer budget constraint.
Factors influencing consumers&#x27; evaluation of the utility of goods include: income level, cultural factors, product information and physio-psychological factors.

Consumption is separated from production, logically, because two different economic agents are involved. In the first case, consumption is determined by the individual. Their specific tastes or preferences determine the amount of utility they derive from goods and services they consume. In the second case, a producer has different motives to the consumer in that they are focussed on the profit they make. This is explained further by producer theory. The models that make up consumer theory are used to represent prospectively observable demand patterns for an individual buyer on the hypothesis of constrained optimization. Prominent variables used to explain the rate at which the good is purchased (demanded) are the price per unit of that good, prices of related goods, and wealth of the consumer.

The law of demand states that the rate of consumption falls as the price of the good rises, even when the consumer is monetarily compensated for the effect of the higher price; this is called the substitution effect. As the price of a good rises, consumers will substitute away from that good, choosing more of other alternatives. If no compensation for the price rise occurs, as is usual, then the decline in overall purchasing power due to the price rise leads, for most goods, to a further decline in the quantity demanded; this is called the income effect. As the wealth of the individual rises, demand for most products increases, shifting the demand curve higher at all possible prices.

In addition, people&#x27;s judgments and decisions are often influenced by systemic biases or heuristics and are strongly dependent on the context in which the decisions are made, small or even unexpected changes in the decision-making environment can greatly affect their decisions.

The basic problem of consumer theory takes the following inputs:
* The &quot;consumption set&quot; &quot;C&quot; – the set of all bundles that the consumer could conceivably consume.
* A &quot;preference relation&quot; over the bundles of &quot;C&quot;. This preference relation can be described as an ordinal utility function, describing the utility that the consumer derives from each bundle.
* A &quot;price system&quot;, which is a function assigning a price to each bundle.
* An &quot;initial endowment&quot;, which is a bundle from &quot;C&quot; that the consumer initially holds. The consumer can sell all or some of his initial bundle in the given prices, and can buy another bundle in the given prices. He has to decide which bundle to buy, under the given prices and budget, in order to maximize their utility.

==Behavioral economics==
Behavioral economics has criticized neoclassical consumer choice theory because reality is more complex that what the theory can determine itself.

Firstly, consumers use heuristics, which means they do not scrutinize decisions too closely but rather make broad generalizations. Further, it is deemed not worthwhile to attempt to determine the value of specific behavior. Heuristics are techniques for simplifying the decision-making process by omitting or disregarding certain information and focusing exclusively on particular elements of alternatives. While some heuristics must be utilized purposefully and deliberately, others can be used relatively effortlessly, even without our conscious awareness. Consumption by individuals is typically impacted by advertising and consumer habits as well.

Secondly, consumers struggle to give standard utils and instead rank distinct options in order of preference, which is referred to as ordinal utility.

Thirdly, it is not always likely that a consumer would stay rational and make the choice which maximizes their utility. Sometimes, individuals are irrational. For example, a consumer making impulsive purchases is not a rational choice. The rise of the internet and social networks may cause changes in consumer behavior, resulting in more planned and sensible purchase processes.

Fourthly, individuals can be reluctant to spend cash on particular items because they have preconceived boundaries on how much they can afford to spend on &#x27;luxuries,&#x27; according to their mental accounting.

Lastly, it is not easy to separate products in the market. Some items, such as an electronic car or a refrigerator, are only purchased occasionally and cannot be mathematically divided.

== Example: homogeneous divisible goods ==
Consider an economy with two types of homogeneous divisible goods, traditionally called X and Y.
* The consumption set is formula_1, i.e. the set of all pairs formula_2 where formula_3 and formula_4. Each bundle contains a non-negative quantity of good X and a non-negative quantity of good Y.
* A typical preference relation can be represented by a set of indifference curves. Each curve represents a set of bundles that give the consumer the same utility. A typical utility function is the Cobb–Douglas function: formula_5, which is shown in the figure below.
* A typical price system assigns a price to each type of good, such that the cost of bundle formula_2 is formula_7.
* A typical initial endowment for an individual is fixed income, which along with transparent prices of goods implies a budget constraint. The consumer can choose any point on or below the budget constraint line formula_8 In the diagram. This line is downward sloped and linear since it represents the boundary of the inequality formula_9. In other words, the amount spent on both goods together is less than or equal to the income of the consumer.

The consumer will choose the indifference curve with the highest utility that is attainable within their budget constraint. Every point on indifference curve I3 is outside the budget constraint. As a result, the most optimal point for the individual is where the indifference curve I2 is tangent to the budget constraint. As a result, the individual will purchase formula_10 of good X and formula_11 of good Y.

Indifference curve analysis begins with the utility function. The utility function is treated as an index of utility. All that is necessary is that the utility index change as more preferred bundles are consumed.

The tangent point between the indifference curve and the budget line is the point at which consumer satisfaction is maximized.

Indifference curves are typically numbered with the number increasing as more preferred bundles are consumed. The numbers have no cardinal significance; for example, if three indifference curves are labeled 1, 4, and 16 respectively that means nothing more than the bundles &quot;on&quot; indifference curve 4 are more preferred than the bundles &quot;on&quot; indifference curve 1.

The income effect and price effect explain how the change in price of a good changes the consumption of the good. The theory of consumer choice examines the trade-offs and decisions people make in their role as consumers as prices and their income change.

== Characteristics of the indifference curve ==

Indifference curves are heuristic devices used in microeconomics to convey preferences of a consumer graphically along with the limitations of a consumer&#x27;s budget.

An indifference curve shows the various combination of two goods that leave the consumer equally satisfied. For example, every point on the indifference curve I1 (as shown in the figure above), which represents a unique combination of good X and good Y, will give the consumer the same utility.

Indifference curves have a few assumptions that explain their nature.

Firstly, indifference curves are typically convex to the origin of the graph. This is because it is assumed that a given consumer will sacrifice consumption in one good for more consumption of the other good. Thus, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS), which is the slope of the indifference curve at any single point along the curve, will decrease when moving down a given indifference curve. Indifference curves can also take various other shapes depending on the preferences of the consumer.

Secondly, for a given consumer, their indifference curves cannot intersect each other. This is because the same set of consumption for a given individual cannot represent two different utility values.

Thirdly, it is assumed that individuals are more satisfied with a bundle of goods on an indifference curve that is further away from the origin. From the graph above, the indifference curve I3 would give the consumer the highest utility whereas I1 would give the lowest utility.

The indifference curves shown in the figure above adhere to the three assumptions outlined in that they are convex, do not intersect, and have a higher utility the further the indifference curve is away from the origin.

== Example: land ==
As a second example, consider an economy that consists of a large land-estate &quot;L&quot;.
* The consumption set is formula_12, i.e. the set of all subsets of &quot;L&quot; (all land parcels).
* A typical preference relation can be represented by a utility function which assigns, to each land parcel, its total &quot;fertility&quot; (the total amount of grain that can be grown in that land).
* A typical price system assigns a price to each land parcel, based on its area.
* A typical initial endowment is either a fixed income, or an initial parcel which the consumer can sell and buy another parcel.

== Sunk cost effect ==
According to the laws of economic logic, sunk costs and making decisions should be irrelevant. However, there is a widespread irrationality in people&#x27;s actual investment activities, production and daily activities that takes sunk costs into account when making decisions.

Sunk costs for individuals may be represented by behaviour in which they make decisions based on the fact that they have paid for this good or service irrespective of current circumstances. An example of this is a consumer who has already purchased their ticket for a concert and may travel through a storm to be able to attend the concert in order to not waste their ticket.

Another example is different payment schedules for gym members may result in different levels of potential sunk costs and affect the frequency of gym visits by consumers. That is to say, the payment schedule with other less frequent (e.g., quarterly, semi-annual or annual payment schedule), compared to a month pay the fee to the gym in a larger, these factors to reduce the cost and reduce the psychological sunk costs, more vivid sunk costs significantly increased people&#x27;s gym visits. In summary, the behaviour of consumers in these two examples can be characterised by their ideal that losses loom larger than gains.

==Role of time constraint effect==

Highly relevant to the study and understanding of consumer choice is the role of time contraint effects. This effect is related to the available time consumers have before making their decision on whether to buy a product or service and which product or service to buy. With the incessant exposure consumers have to businesses through the avenues of social media, television, billboards and radio, time constraint effects can significantly impact the decision-making process of these consumers.

A study was conducted to measure the computational processes of subjects when faced with a decision to choose a product from a bundle of slightly differentiated products, whilst faced with a time constraint. The study was conducted through an experiment in which participants were in a supermarket-like environment and were asked to pick a snack food item from a screenshot out of a set of either 4, 9 or 16 similar items with a 3-second time window.

The results show that consumers are typically good at optimizing items that they have seen within the search process, i.e., they can easily make a choice from the “seen-set” of items. The results also show that consumers mostly use the hybrid model as a computational process for consumer choice. The data is most qualitatively consistent with the hybrid model rather than the optimal or satisfying models.

This reliance on impulsive data however isn&#x27;t necessarily representative of today&#x27;s market, throughout the pandemic consumers where largely forced to use online shopping methods making browsing between competitors easier, allowing for indulgence in research and conversations outside of the retailers control and evaluation of the need for a product to be completed at the individuals pace. This indicates that the time constraint effect may be less controlling of consumers choice than initially discussed.

However, important consideration should be made based temporal effects of a purchase. A study found that consumers often fall into a prevention-promotion mindset depending on the urgency of a decision. A prevention mindset comes from the need for your goals to align with your responsibilities. A promotion mindset revolves around the experience of new things. When faced with a purchase consumers were found to adopt the prevention mindset however when the purchase was distant a promotion mindset was adopted.

In conclusion the role of the time constraint effect on consumer choice is highly relevant when informing consumer choices. With the ability to extend the time constraint by using remote shopping consumers can often make a more informed decision however when the time for purchase arrives consumers often fall into a prevention focus mindset.

== Effect of online reviews ==
During the online shopping process, retailers encourage customers to share their product reviews on digital platforms such as e-commerce websites and social media, which in turn helps other shoppers to have a better understanding of the product. Online consumer reviews play a crucial role in providing product information before consumers make a purchase decision. These reviews, full of desires, preferences and behavioural insights, are a valuable source of data for both consumers and businesses. By understanding consumer behaviour and preferences, businesses can develop strategic plans to improve the quality of their services and tailor their offerings to better meet the needs of their customers.

For example, when consumers do an online search for hotels, they can compare prices, locations, services and other aspects of various potential hotels on the site. The platform can also provide personalised recommendations based on a user&#x27;s search history and preferences. Based on the attributes listed for each hotel, consumers can make an informed decision that is influenced by the consistency between their perceived hotel performance and their preferences – a classic multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problem. Vocabulary-based sentiment analysis is incorporated into online reviews to create product rankings that take into account the sentiment score of the review, the brand ranking of the product and the usefulness of the review.

In the context of travel, travellers&#x27; choices and behaviours when selecting restaurants are heavily influenced by their travel classification or purpose, such as leisure, business or adventure. The study&#x27;s modelling results suggest that travellers show diverse preferences in terms of dining behaviour, depending on factors such as environment, type of cuisine, price range and dietary restrictions. While the study provides valuable insights into restaurant decision-making, it also acknowledges limitations and suggests other directions for research to further explore consumer preferences in various contexts.

However, the sheer volume of online reviews and the need to consider various attributes when making decisions can be overwhelming for consumers. In many cases, it can be a challenge to discern genuine reviews from fake ones or marketing-driven content. Therefore, tools and methods must be developed to help consumers make informed choices by helping them rank product candidates based on other consumers&#x27; reviews and their preferences. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms has the potential to help sift through large amounts of data, extract useful insights and provide personalised recommendations to consumers.

In short, online consumer reviews are an important resource for shoppers and businesses alike. Using this information can help businesses better understand consumer preferences, improve their offerings and ultimately increase customer satisfaction. For consumers, having access to aggregated, relevant and trustworthy information can greatly enhance their decision-making process and overall online shopping experience.

== Effect of a price change ==

The indifference curves and budget constraint can be used to predict the effect of changes to the budget constraint. The graph below shows the effect of a price increase for good Y. If the price of Y increases, the budget constraint will pivot from formula_13 to formula_14. Notice that because the price of X does not change, the consumer can still buy the same amount of X if he or she chooses to buy only good X. On the other hand, if the consumer chooses to buy only good Y, he or she will be able to buy less of good Y because its price has increased.

Now, the consumption of good X and Y will be re-allocated to account for the price change in good Y. To maximize their utility, the consumption bundle that is on the highest indifference curve that is tangent to formula_14. This consumption bundle is now (X1, Y1) as shown in the figure below. As a result, the amount of good Y bought has shifted from Y2 to Y1, and the amount of good X bought has shifted from X2 to X1. The opposite effect will occur if the price of Y decreases causing the budget constrain to shift from formula_13 to formula_17, and the highest indifference curve that maximises the consumers utility shifts from I2 to I3.

If these curves are plotted for many different prices of good Y, a demand curve for good Y can be constructed. The diagram below shows the demand curve for good Y as its price varies. Alternatively, if the price for good Y is fixed and the price for good X is varied, a demand curve for good X can be constructed.

== Income effect ==

The income effect is the phenomenon observed through changes in purchasing power. It reveals the change in quantity demanded brought by a change in real income. Graphically, as long as the prices remain constant, changing income will create a parallel shift of the budget constraint. Increasing income will shift the budget constraint right since more of both goods can be bought by the consumer. On the other hand, a decrease in income will shift the budget constraint to the left.

Depending on the indifference curves, as income increases, the quantity purchased of a good can either increase, decrease or stay the same. In the figure below, good Y is a normal good since the amount purchased increased as the budget constraint shifted from BC1 to the higher income budget constraint, BC2. However, good &quot;X&quot; is an inferior good since the quantity purchased by the consumer decreased as their income increased.

formula_18 is the change in the demand for good 1 when we change income from formula_19 to formula_20, holding the price of good 1 fixed at formula_21:

: formula_22

The equilibrium points at various levels of consumer&#x27;s income builds the income consumption curve. This curve traces out the income consumption curve traces out the income effect on the quantity consumed of the goods.

==Price effect as the sum of substitution and income effects==

Every price change can be decomposed into an income effect and a substitution effect; the price effect is the sum of substitution and income effects.

The substitution effect is the change in demands resulting from a price change that alters the slope of the budget constraint but leaves the consumer on the same indifference curve. In other words, it illustrates the consumer&#x27;s new consumption basket after the price change while being compensated as to allow the consumer to be as satisfied as he or she was previously. By this effect, the consumer is posited to substitute toward the good that becomes comparatively less expensive. In the illustration below this corresponds to an imaginary budget constraint denoted SC being tangent to the indifference curve I1. Then the income effect from the rise in purchasing power from a price fall reinforces the substitution effect. If the good is an inferior good, then the income effect will offset in some degree the substitution effect. If the income effect for an inferior good is sufficiently strong, the consumer will buy less of the good when it becomes less expensive. This is also known as a Giffen good (commonly believed to be a rarity).

The substitution effect, formula_23, is the change in the amount demanded for formula_24 when the price of good formula_24 falls from formula_26 to formula_27 (represented by the budget constraint shifting from formula_14 to formula_13 and thus increasing purchasing power) and, at the same time, the money income falls from formula_20 to formula_19 to keep the consumer at the same level of utility on I1:

:formula_32

The substitution effect increases the amount demanded of good formula_24 from formula_34 to formula_35 in the diagram. In the example shown, the income effect of the fall in formula_36 partly offsets the substitution effect as the amount demanded of formula_24 in the absence of an offsetting income change ends up at formula_38 thus the income effect from the rise in purchasing power due to the price drop is that the quantity demanded of formula_24 goes from formula_35 to formula_41. The total effect of the price drop of good Y on the quantity demanded is the sum of the substitution effect and the income effect.

== Indifference curves for goods that are perfect substitutes or complements ==
=== Perfect substitutes ===
A perfect substitute is a good or service which can be used in exactly the same way as the good or service it replaces. Products which are perfect substitutes for one another will exhibit straight lines on the indifference curve (as shown in the figure to the right). This demonstrates that the relative utility of one good is equivalent to the relative utility of the other, regardless of their quantity. An example of perfect substitutes could be Coca-Cola compared to Pepsi Max. A consumer who considers these products as perfect substitutes will be indifferent to spending all of their budget on strictly one or the other.

=== Perfect complements ===
A perfect complement is a good or service whose appeal increases with the popularity of its complement. The relationship between both goods X and Y are naturally dependent on each other along with the concept of consumption being dependent upon other consumption. Products that are perfect complements will be demonstrated graphically on an indifference curve with two lines at perfect right angles to one another (as shown in the figure to the right). This demonstrates that the demand and consumption of one good is inherently tied to the other. In other words, when the consumption of one good increases, as does the consumption of the complementary good. An example of complementary goods is shown in the figure to the right. Left shoes and right shoes can be considered perfect compliments as the ratio between sales of left and right shoes will never shift noticeably from 1:1.

== Utility ==
The usefulness of a good is a key factor when discussing consumer decision making. When a product both meets the needs of a consumer and has value it has utility. Utility can be quantified through a set of numerical values that reflect the relative rankings of various bundles of goods measured by consumers preference in their consumption.

Utility function measures the preferences consumers apply to their consumption of goods and services. One of the most well known utility functions is the Cobb–Douglas utility function.

Marginal utility

Marginal utility differs from utility as it refers to the additional benefit derived from consuming one more unit of a specific good or service. Marginal utility result can be positive, neutral or negative depending on the outcomes for the consumer. Utility is not constant, and for every additional unit consumed, often the consumer experiences what economists refer to as the diminishing marginal utility or diminishing returns, where each additional unit adds less and less marginal utility.

It can be represented by the formula below:

: &quot;MU&quot;&quot;Z&quot; = △&quot;U&quot;/△&quot;Z&quot;

where &quot;MU&quot;&quot;Z&quot; represents the marginal utility of good &quot;Z&quot;; △&quot;U&quot; and △&quot;Z&quot; represent changes in utility and consumption of good &quot;Z&quot; respectively.

== Assumptions ==
The behavioral assumption of the consumer theory proposed herein is that all consumers seek to maximize utility. Traditionally in economics, this activity of maximizing utility has been deemed as the &quot;rational&quot; behavior of decision makers. More specifically, in the eyes of economists, all consumers seek to maximize their utility function subject to a budgetary constraint. In other words, economists assume that consumers will always choose the &quot;best&quot; bundle of goods they can afford. Consumer theory is therefore based on generating refutable hypotheses about the nature of consumer demand from this behavioral postulate.

In order to reason from the central postulate towards a useful model of consumer choice, it is necessary to make additional assumptions about the certain preferences that consumers employ when selecting their preferred &quot;bundle&quot; of goods. These are relatively strict, allowing for the model to generate more useful hypotheses with regard to consumer behavior than weaker assumptions, which would allow any empirical data to be explained in terms of stupidity, ignorance, or some other factor, and hence would not be able to generate any predictions about future demand at all. For the most part, however, they represent statements which would only be contradicted if a consumer was acting in (what was widely regarded as) a strange manner. In this vein, the modern form of consumer choice theory assumes:

:Consumer choice theory is based on the assumption that the consumer fully understands their own preferences, allowing for a simple but accurate comparison between any two bundles of good presented. That is to say, it is assumed that if a consumer is presented with two consumption bundles A and B each containing different combinations of &quot;n&quot; goods, the consumer can unambiguously decide if (s)he prefers A to B, B to A, or is indifferent to both. The few scenarios where it is possible to imagine that decision-making would be very difficult are thus placed &quot;outside the domain of economic analysis&quot;. However, discoveries in behavioral economics has found that actual decision making is affected by various factors, such as whether choices are presented together or separately through the distinction bias.

;Preferences are complete
:When a consumer is faced with a choice between two goods A and B, they must rank them so that only one of the followings is true: the consumer prefers the good A to good B, the consumer prefers good B to good A, or the consumer is indifferent between the goods.
: &quot;Either A ≥ B or B ≥ A (or both) for all (A,B).&quot;
;Preference are transitive
:This assumption dictates that if good A is preferred to good B and good B is preferred to good C then good A must be preferred to good C. This also means that if the consumer is indifferent between goods A and B and is indifferent between goods B and C she will be indifferent between goods A and C. This is the consistency assumption. This assumption eliminates the possibility of intersecting indifference curves.
: &quot;If A ≥ B and B ≥ C, then A ≥ B (for all A, B, C).&quot;
;Preferences are reflexive
:Relationships are reflexive if they can be applied when both sides of the relationship are the same. Weak preference relationships are reflexive. A bundle of goods can be said to be weakly preferred to itself, but not strictly preferred to itself. As such, a consumer would say that they consider good A to be at least as good as good B. Alternatively, the axiom can be modified to read that the consumer is indifferent with regard to A and B.
;Preferences exhibit non-satiation
:The assumption of non-satiated preferences means that more is better – all else being the same, more of a commodity is better than less of it. This is the &quot;more is always better&quot; assumption; that in general if a consumer is offered two almost identical bundles A and B, but where B includes more of one particular good, the consumer will choose bundle B. In other words, this theory assumes that a consumer will never be completely satisfied, as they will always be happier consuming a little bit more. Among other things this assumption precludes circular indifference curves. Non-satiation in this sense is not a necessary but a convenient assumption. It avoids unnecessary complications in the mathematical models.
;Indifference curves exhibit diminishing marginal rates of substitution
:This assumption assures that indifference curves are smooth and convex to the origin and is implicit in the last assumption.
:This assumption also set the stage for using techniques of constrained optimization. This is because the shape of the indifference curve assures that the first derivative is negative and the second is positive.
:This assumption incorporates the theory of diminishing marginal utility. This theory of diminishing marginal utility states that the added satisfaction experienced by a consumer from having one additional unit of a good or service will diminish. In other words, the marginal utility of each additional unit will decline. An example of this can be illustrated by a consumer who orders several coffees throughout the course of a day. The marginal utility experienced by the first coffee will be greater than the second. The marginal utility experienced by the second coffee will be greater than the third, and so on.
;Goods are available in all quantities
:It is assumed that a consumer may choose to purchase any quantity of a goods they desire, for example, 2.6 eggs and 4.23 loaves of bread. Whilst this makes the model less precise, it is generally acknowledged to provide a useful simplification to the calculations involved in consumer choice theory, especially since consumer demand is often examined over a considerable period of time.

Note the assumptions do not guarantee that the demand curve will be negatively sloped. A positively sloped curve is not inconsistent with the assumptions.

=== Use value ===
In Marx&#x27;s critique of the political economy, any labor-product has a value and a use value, and if it is traded as a commodity in markets, it additionally has an exchange value, most often expressed as a money-price. Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also have a general utility, implied by the fact that people want them, but he argues that this by itself tells us nothing about the specific character of the economy in which they are produced and sold.

== Labor-leisure trade-off ==
Consumer theory is also relevant when considering the trade-off between labour and leisure, allowing us to examine the choices made based on consumers preferences and constraints. In this analysis, labour and leisure are both considered goods. Since a consumer has a finite amount of time, they must make a choice between leisure (which earns no income for consumption) and labor (which does earn income for consumption). Using this method the opportunity cost of their decisions can dictate consumers actions.

The previous model of consumer choice theory is applicable with only slight modifications. Primarily, the total amount of time that an individual has to allocate is known as their &quot;time endowment&quot;, and is often denoted as &quot;T&quot;. Next, the amount an individual allocates to labor (&quot;L&quot;) and leisure (&quot;ℓ&quot;) is constrained by &quot;T&quot; such that:

:formula_42

Consumption (C), which represents the amount of goods or services a person can take, is determined as the amount of labor they choose multiplied by the amount they are paid per hour of labor (their wage, often denoted &quot;w&quot;). Thus, the amount that a person consumes is:

:formula_43

Such that, when a consumer chooses no leisure formula_44 then formula_45 and formula_46.

From this labor-leisure tradeoff model, both the substitution effect and the income effect can be used to analyse various changes caused by welfare benefits, labor taxation, or tax credits.

It is important to note that the labour-leisure tradeoff will also be impacted on consumers norms, preferences and other non-economical factors. Therefore, real world applications of this relationship should be supported by an understanding of the factors previously listed to ensure oversights for consumer behaviour are avoided.

<doc id="232169" wikidata="Q383906" url="?curid=232169" title="Shoplifting">
<text>Shoplifting (also known as shop theft, shop fraud, retail theft, or retail fraud) is the theft of goods from a retail establishment during business hours. The terms &quot;shoplifting&quot; and &quot;shoplifter&quot; are not usually defined in law, and generally fall under larceny. In the retail industry, the word &quot;shrinkage&quot; (or &quot;shrink&quot;) is used to refer to merchandise often lost by shoplifting. The term five-finger discount is an euphemism for shoplifting, humorously referencing stolen items taken &quot;at no cost&quot; with the five fingers.

The first documented shoplifting started to take place in 16th century London. By the early 19th century, shoplifting was believed to be primarily a female activity. In the 1960s, shoplifting began to be redefined again, this time as a political act. Researchers divide shoplifters into two categories: boosters (professionals who resell what they steal), and snitches (amateurs who steal for their personal use). Shoplifters range from amateurs acting on impulse to career criminals who habitually engage in shoplifting as a form of income. Career criminals may use several individuals to shoplift, with some participants distracting store employees while another participant steals items. Amateurs typically steal products for personal use, while career criminals generally steal items to resell them on the black market. Other forms of shoplifting include swapping price labels of different items, return fraud, or consuming food and drink at a grocery store without paying for it. Commonly shoplifted items are those with a high price in proportion to their size, such as disposable razor blades, electronic devices, vitamins, alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes.

Stores use a number of strategies to reduce shoplifting, including storing small, expensive items in locked glass cases; chaining or otherwise attaching items (particularly expensive ones) to shelves or clothes racks; attaching magnetic or radio sensors or dyepacks to items; installing curved mirrors mounted above shelves or video cameras and video monitors, hiring plainclothes store detectives and security guards, and banning the bringing in of backpacks or other bags. Some stores have security guards at the exit, who search backpacks and bags and check receipts. Stores also combat shoplifting by training employees how to detect potential shoplifters.

==Definition==
Shoplifting is the act of knowingly taking goods from an establishment in which they are displayed for sale, without paying for them. Shoplifting usually involves concealing items on the person or an accomplice, and leaving the store without paying. However, shoplifting can also include price switching (swapping the price labels of different goods), refund fraud, and &quot;grazing&quot; (eating or sampling a store&#x27;s goods while in the store). Price switching is now an almost extinct form of shoplifting for two reasons. First, the labels will split apart upon attempted removal, and second, virtually all retail cashiers now scan items at the register, rather than relying on price stickers. Retailers report that shoplifting has a significant effect on their bottom line, stating that about 0.6% of all inventory disappears to shoplifters.

Generally, criminal theft involves taking possession of property illegally. In self-service shops, customers are allowed by the property owner to take physical possession of the property by holding or moving it. This leaves areas of ambiguity that could criminalize some people for simple mistakes, such as accidentally putting a small item in a pocket or forgetting to pay. For this reason penalties for shoplifting are often lower than those for general theft. Few jurisdictions have specific shoplifting legislation with which to differentiate it from other forms of theft, so reduced penalties are usually at a judge&#x27;s discretion. Most retailers are aware of the serious consequences of making a false arrest, and will only attempt to apprehend a person if their guilt is beyond a reasonable doubt. Depending on local laws, arrests made by anyone other than law enforcement officers may also be illegal.

In England and Wales, theft is defined as &quot;dishonestly appropriate[ing] property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and &quot;thief&quot; and &quot;steal&quot; shall be construed accordingly.&quot; It is one of the most common crimes. Shoplifting peaks between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m., and is lowest from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. In the United States, shoplifting increases during the Christmas season, and arrest rates increase during spring break. Rutgers University criminologist Ronald V. Clarke says shoplifters steal &quot;hot products&quot; that are &quot;CRAVED&quot;, an acronym he created that stands for &quot;concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable&quot;.

== History ==
Shoplifting, originally called &quot;lifting&quot;, is as old as shopping. The first documented shoplifting started to take place in 16th-century London, and was carried out by groups of men called lifters. In 1591, playwright Robert Greene published a pamphlet titled &quot;The Second Part of Cony Catching&quot;, in which he described how three men could conspire to shoplift clothes and fabric from London merchants. When it was first documented, shoplifting was characterized as an underworld practice: shoplifters were also con artists, pickpockets, pimps, or prostitutes.

In the late 17th century, London shopkeepers began to display goods in ways designed to attract shoppers, such as in window displays and glass cases. This made the goods more accessible for shoppers to handle and examine, which historians say led to an acceleration of shoplifting.

The word shoplift (then, shop-lift) first appeared at the end of the 17th century in books like &quot;The Ladies Dictionary&quot;, which, as well as describing shoplifting, provided tips on losing weight and styling hair. Female shoplifters of this period were also called &quot;Amazons&quot; or &quot;roaring girl&quot;. Notorious female shoplifters in London included Mary Frith, the pickpocket and fence also known as Moll Cutpurse, pickpocket Moll King, Sarah McCabe whose shoplifting career spanned twenty years, and Maria Carlston (also known as Mary Blacke), whose life was documented by diarist Samuel Pepys, who was eventually executed for theft, and who for years shoplifted clothing and household linens in London with one or more female accomplices.

In 1699, the English Parliament passed The Shoplifting Act, part of the Bloody Code that punished petty crimes with death. People convicted of shoplifting items worth more than five shillings would be hanged in London&#x27;s Tyburn Tree (known as the &quot;Tyburn jig&quot;) with crowds of thousands watching, or would be transported to the North American colonies or to Botany Bay in Australia. Some merchants found The Shoplifting Act overly severe, jurors often deliberately under-valued the cost of items stolen so convicted shoplifters would escape death, and reformist lawyers advocated for the Act&#x27;s repeal, but The Shoplifting Act was supported by powerful people such as Lord Ellenborough, who characterized penal transportation as &quot;a summer airing to a milder climate&quot; and the archbishop of Canterbury, who believed that strong punishment was necessary to prevent a dramatic increase in crime. As England began to embrace Enlightenment ideas about crime and punishment in the 18th century, opposition to the Bloody Code began to grow. The last English execution for shoplifting was carried out in 1822, and in 1832 the House of Lords reclassified shoplifting as a non-capital crime.

By the early 19th century, shoplifting was believed to be primarily a female activity, and doctors began to redefine some shoplifting as what Swiss doctor André Matthey had then newly christened &quot;klopemania&quot; (kleptomania), from the Greek words &quot;&quot;kleptein&quot; (stealing) and &quot;mania&quot;&quot; (insanity). Kleptomania was primarily attributed to wealthy and middle-class women, and in 1896 was criticized by anarchist Emma Goldman as a way for the rich to excuse their own class from punishment, while continuing to punish the poor for the same acts.

In the 1960s, shoplifting began to be redefined again, this time as a political act. In his 1970 book &quot;Do It: Scenarios of the Revolution&quot;, American activist Jerry Rubin wrote &quot;All money represents theft...shoplifting gets you high. Don&#x27;t buy. Steal,&quot; and in &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot;, published in 1971, American author William Powell offered tips for how to shoplift. In his 1971 book &quot;Steal This Book&quot;, American activist Abbie Hoffman offered tips on how to shoplift and argued that shoplifting is anti-corporate. In her book &quot;The Steal: A Cultural History of Shoplifting&quot;, social historian Rachel Shteir described how shoplifting from companies you dislike is considered by some activist groups, such as some freegans, decentralized anarchist collective CrimethInc, the Spanish anarchist collective Yomango and the Canadian magazine Adbusters, to be a morally defensible act of corporate sabotage.

==Common targets==
Commonly shoplifted items are usually small and easy to hide, such as groceries, especially steak and instant coffee, razor blades and cartridges, small technology items such as vapes, smartphones, USB flash drives, earphones, gift cards, cosmetics, jewelry, multivitamins, pregnancy tests, electric toothbrushes, and clothing. The most commonly shoplifted item used to be cigarettes until stores started keeping them behind the cash register.

==Methods==
===Concealing===
Shoplifters may conceal items in their pockets, under their clothes, in bags, or in a personal item they are carrying (for example, a box) or pushing (for example, a stroller) or, if at a shopping center/mall, a bag from another store in that center. The use of backpacks and other bags to shoplift has led some stores to not allow people with backpacks in the store, often by asking the person to leave their backpack at a store counter. With clothes, shoplifters may put on the store clothing underneath their own clothes and leave the store.

===Walkout/pushout===
Some shoppers fill a shopping cart with unconcealed merchandise, and walk out of the store without paying. Security workers call that method &quot;walkout&quot; or &quot;pushout&quot;. With clothing, some shoplifters may simply put on a coat or jacket from the store and walk out wearing the item. This tactic is used because busy employees may simply not notice a person pushing a cart out without paying or walking out wearing a store-owned coat. Some &quot;pushout&quot; shoplifters purposefully exit quickly to avoid detection, as this gives employees less time to react.

Many stores instruct employees other than those directly involved in theft prevention or security to confront someone only verbally to avoid any possibility of being held liable for injury or unwarranted detention. While that may allow stolen goods to not be recovered, the loss of revenue may be judged to be acceptable in light of the cost of a potential lawsuit or an employee being injured by a fleeing shoplifter.

==Offenders==
Offenders can be broken into two general categories, individuals who shoplift for personal gain, and professionals who shoplift for purposes of resale. 

===Individuals===
Some shoplifters are amateurs who do not steal regularly from stores and who do not use shoplifting as a form of income (e.g., by reselling stolen goods). Researchers call these amateurs &quot;snitches,&quot; as they are stealing items for their personal use. In several countries, criminal flash mobs, primarily made up of teenagers and young adults, enter stores with the intention of stealing merchandise while accomplices distract staff.

===Professionals and criminal organizations===
Some people and groups make their living from shoplifting. They tend to be more skilled career criminals who use more sophisticated shoplifting tactics. Some researchers call professional thieves &quot;boosters,&quot; as they tend to resell what they steal on the black market.

Regional gangs and international crime organizations may create and coordinate shoplifting rings. These rings may involve multiple shoplifters, diversions, and the complicity of employees in a targeted business. Some shoplifting rings focus on stealing items included on lists provided by the criminal leaders. Some organized theft groups engage in labor trafficking, smuggling undocumented individuals into a country and then requiring them to steal in order to pay off fees and debts associated with their being smuggled across the border.

==Motivation==
Motivations for shoplifting are controversial among researchers, although they generally agree that shoplifters are driven by either economic or psychosocial motives. Psychosocial motivations may include peer pressure, a desire for thrill or excitement, impulse, stealing because judgment is clouded by intoxication, or doing so because of a compulsion. Depression is the psychiatric disorder most commonly associated with shoplifting. Shoplifting is also associated with family or marital stress, social isolation, having had a difficult childhood, alcoholism or drug use, low self-esteem, and eating disorders, with bulimic shoplifters frequently stealing food. Some researchers have theorized that shoplifting is an unconscious attempt to make up for a past loss.

Researchers have found that the decision to shoplift is associated with pro-shoplifting attitudes, social factors, opportunities for shoplifting and the perception that the shoplifter is unlikely to be caught. Researchers say that shoplifters justify their shoplifting through a variety of personal narratives, such as believing they are making up for having been victimized, that they are unfairly being denied things they deserve, or that the retailers they steal from are untrustworthy or immoral. Sociologists call these narratives neutralizations, meaning mechanisms people use to silence values within themselves that would otherwise prevent them from carrying out a particular act.

Developmental psychologists believe that children under the age of nine shoplift to test boundaries, and that tweens and teenagers shoplift mainly for excitement or the thrill, are &quot;acting out&quot; (or depressed), or are being pressured by their peers.

==Economics==
Economists say shoplifting is common because it is a relatively unskilled crime with low entry barriers that can be fitted into a normal lifestyle. People of every nation, race, ethnicity, gender and social class shoplift. Originally, analysis of data about apprehended shoplifters and interviews with store detectives suggested that females were almost twice as likely as males to shoplift. However, since 1980, the data suggest that males are equally or more likely to shoplift than females. The average shoplifter first did it at the age of ten: shoplifting tends to peak in adolescence then steadily declines thereafter. People of all races shoplift equally, and poor people shoplift only slightly more than rich people. Men tend to shoplift using bags, and women using strollers. When caught, a shoplifter has on average $200 worth of unpaid merchandise.

=== Economic impact ===
According to a report from Tyco Retail Solutions, the global retail industry lost an estimated $34 billion in sales in 2017 to shoplifting, which is approximately 2 percent of total revenue. Shoplifting is the largest single reason for loss of merchandise.

Retailers report that shoplifting has a significant effect on their bottom line, stating that about 0.6% of all inventory disappears to shoplifters. According to the 2012 National Retail Security Survey, shoplifting costs American retailers approximately $14B annually. In 2001, it was claimed that shoplifting cost US retailers $25 million a day. Observers believe that industry shoplifting numbers are over half employee theft or fraud and the rest by patrons. Of course, if apprehended during the shoplifting the merchandise is generally recovered by the retailers and there is often no loss to the store owner when the merchandise is surrendered to the store by the suspects. In addition, in many states retailers have the right to recover civil damages to cover the cost of providing security.

According to a December 23, 2008, article in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, Dimperio&#x27;s Market, the only full-service grocery store in the Hazelwood neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, closed because of shoplifters. Walgreens reported that it closed 10 stores in the San Francisco area between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to a surge in theft.

In mid-October of 2021, Walgreens announced the closure of five stores in San Francisco due to an increase in retail theft in San Francisco. 

==Differences by geography==
Researches say that around the world, in countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Japan, and India, people tend to shoplift the same types of items, and frequently even the same brands.

But there are also differences in shoplifting among different countries that reflect those countries&#x27; general consumption habits and preferences. In Milan, saffron, an expensive component of risotto alla Milanese, is frequently shoplifted, and throughout Italy, parmigiano reggiano is often stolen from supermarkets. In Spain, jamón ibérico is a frequent target. In France, the anise-flavoured liqueur ricard is frequently stolen, and in Japan, experts believe that manga comics, electronic games and whisky are most frequently stolen. Bookstores and magazine sellers in Japan have also complained about what they call &quot;digital shoplifting&quot;, which refers to the photographing of material in-store for later reading. Packaged cheese has been the most frequently shoplifted item in Norway, with thieves selling it afterwards to pizza parlours and fast food restaurants.

== Consequences ==

Shoplifting is considered a form of theft in most jurisdictions. Retailers may also ban from their premises those who have shoplifted from stores.

=== United States ===

In most cases in the United States, store employees and managers have certain powers of arrest. Store officials may detain for investigation (for a reasonable length of time) the person who they have probable cause to believe is attempting to take or has unlawfully taken merchandise (see shopkeeper&#x27;s privilege). Store employees may also have citizen&#x27;s arrest powers, but absent a statute granting broader authority, a citizen&#x27;s arrest power is normally available only for felony offenses, while shoplifting is usually a misdemeanor offense.

In the United States, store employees who detain suspects outside of and inside the store premises are generally granted limited powers of arrest by state law, and have the power to initiate criminal arrests or civil sanctions, or both, depending upon the policy of the retailer and the state statutes governing civil demands and civil recovery for shoplifting as reconciled with the criminal laws of the jurisdiction.

===England and Wales===

In England and Wales, an offence involving shoplifting may be charged under Section 1 of the Theft Act 1986; alternatively, if the goods stolen are worth less than £200, a person may be charged under Section 176 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty is a fine or up to six months in prison if the goods stolen are worth less than £200; if they are worth more than £200, the maximum penalty is seven years in prison.

=== Middle East ===

In the Islamic legal system called Sharia, &quot;hudud&quot; (&quot;limits&quot; or &quot;restrictions&quot;) calls for &quot;sariqa&quot; (&quot;theft&quot;) to be punished by amputation of the thief&#x27;s right hand. This punishment is categorized as &quot;hadd&quot;, meaning a punishment that restrains or prevents further crime. Sariqa is interpreted differently in different countries and by different scholars, and some say it does not include shoplifting. In Saudi Arabia, shoplifters&#x27; hands may be amputated, though.

==Prevention==

Shoplifting may be prevented and detected. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring is an important anti-shoplifting technology. Electronic article surveillance (EAS) is another method of inventory protection. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is an anti-employee-theft and anti-shoplifting technology used in retailers such as Walmart, which already heavily use RFID technology for inventory purposes. Loss prevention personnel can consist of both uniformed officers and plain-clothed store detectives. Large department stores will use both and smaller stores will use one or the other depending on their shrink strategy. Store detectives will patrol the store acting as if they are real shoppers. Physical measures include implementing a one-way entry and exit system, protected with devices such as &quot;shark teeth&quot; gates to ensure trolleys can only pass through one way.

===Closed-circuit television===

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring is an important anti-shoplifting technology. Retailers focusing on loss prevention often devote most of their resources to this technology. Using CCTVs to apprehend shoplifters in the act requires full-time human monitoring of the cameras.
Sophisticated CCTV systems discriminate the scenes to detect and segregate suspicious behaviour from numerous screens and to enable automatic alerting. However, the attentiveness of the surveillance personnel may be threatened by false reliance on automatics.
CCTV is more effective if used in conjunction with electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems. The EAS system will warn of a potential shoplifter and the video may provide evidence for prosecution if the shoplifter is allowed to pass checkout points or leave store premises with unbought merchandise.

Many stores will use public-view monitors in the store to show people there that they are being recorded. That is intended as a deterrent to shoplifting. Some stores use inexpensive dummy cameras. Even though these fake cameras cannot record images, their presence may deter shoplifting.

===Electronic article surveillance===
Electronic article surveillance (EAS) are magnetic or radio-frequency tags that sound an alarm if a shoplifter leaves a store with store items that have not been paid for. EAS methods are second only to CCTV in popularity amongst retailers looking for inventory protection. EAS refers to the electronic security tags that are attached to merchandise and cause an alarm to sound on exiting the store. Some stores also have detection systems at the entrance to the restrooms that sound an alarm if someone tries to take unpaid merchandise with them into the restrooms. Regularly, even when an alarm does sound, a shoplifter walks out casually and is not confronted if no guards are present because of the high number of false alarms, especially in malls, due to &quot;tag pollution&quot; whereby non-deactivated tags from other stores set off the alarm. This can be overcome with newer systems and a properly trained staff. Some new systems either do not alarm from &quot;tag pollution&quot; or they produce a specific alarm when a customer enters the store with a non-deactivated tag so that store personnel can remove or deactivate it so it does not produce a false alarm when exiting the store. However, spider wrap may be used instead of tags.
Some tags are stuck onto merchandise with glue (rather than being superimposed on) the shoplifter can easily scrape off the tag in their pocket. Pedestal EAS covers, which are made of durable vinyl, offer cost-effective means of adding a marketing tool at every entrance to a store; they are also custom-manufactured to fit any pedestal and can be printed to highlight specific brands or seasonal promotions. They do not interfere with the performance of the EAS systems and are easily cleaned or changed. Some shoplifters may employ jammer devices to prevent EAS tags from triggering, or magnets to remove the tags. Stores may employ technology to detect jammers and magnets.

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is an anti-employee-theft and anti-shoplifting technology used in retailers such as Walmart, which already heavily use RFID technology for inventory purposes. If a product with an active RFID tag passes the exit scanners at a Walmart outlet, not only does it set off an alarm, but it also tells security personnel exactly what product to look for in the shopper&#x27;s cart.

===Exit inspections===
In the United States, shoppers are under no actual obligation to accede to such a search unless the employee has reasonable grounds to suspect shoplifting and arrests the customer or takes or looks at the receipt from the customer without violating any laws or if the customer has signed a membership agreement which stipulates that customers will subject themselves to inspections before taking the purchased merchandise from the store. In the cases of Sam&#x27;s Club and Costco, the contracts merely say that it is their policy to check receipts at the exit or that they &quot;reserve the right.&quot; That wording does not specify the results of non-compliance by the customer, and since they did not have a right to re-check receipts in the first place, it may not be legally binding at all. The purchaser who holds the receipt owns the merchandise. Employees who harass, assault, touch, or detain customers or take their purchased merchandise may be committing torts or crimes against the customers.

===Display cases===

Some expensive merchandise will be in a locked case requiring an employee to get items at a customer&#x27;s request. The customer is either required to purchase the merchandise immediately or it is left at the checkout register (under the supervision of a cashier) for the customer to purchase when finished shopping. This prevents the customer from having a chance to conceal the item.

<text>Emmonsaspis is a Cambrian chordate, and its fossils were found in the Cambrian-age Parker Slate of Vermont in the late 19th century.

== Description ==
&quot;Emmonsaspis&quot; is a chordate related to &quot;Metaspriggina&quot; and &quot;Nuucichthys&quot;. It grew to roughly in length and probably fed on plankton in the water column. No trace of a spinal cord is present, although roughly 50 myomeres can be seen in the fossils. It had large eyes and a large organ behind its branchial chamber, probably a liver.

There are two species: &quot;Emmonaspis worthanella&quot; and &quot;Emmonaspis cambriensis&quot; (Walcott(?) 1886(?) 1911(?)).

&quot;E. cambrensis&quot; has been described as a graptolite, a chordate, an arthropod and as a frond-like organism.

== Affinities ==

It was interpreted by paleontologist C. D. Walcott in 1911 as a polychaete worm. Although some paleontologists regarded it as an early chordate allied with &quot;Pikaia&quot; et al., Conway Morris suggested in 1993 that it might be a Cambrian descendant of the Vendian form &quot;Pteridinium&quot;, and a frondose morphology was accepted, until a 2024 study found &quot;Emmonsaspis&quot; to be in a polytomy with &quot;Metaspriggina&quot; and &quot;Nuucichthys&quot; as a stem-group vertebrate.

<text>A hauberk or byrnie is a mail shirt. The term is usually used to describe a shirt reaching at least to mid-thigh and including sleeves. A haubergeon (&quot;little hauberk&quot;) refers to a smaller mail shirt, that was sometimes sleeveless, but the terms are occasionally used interchangeably. Mail armor, likely invented by the Celts, became widely adopted for its flexibility and spread throughout Europe and Asia, becoming a staple in Roman legions and medieval warfare. By the 11th century, the hauberk evolved into a knee-length, sleeved mail shirt, as depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry and it remained in use in Europe until the Renaissance despite the rise of plate armor.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;hauberk&quot; () comes from the Old French word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;coat of mail&quot;, which originally derived from the earlier Frankish or similar Germanic word &quot;&quot;, literally translating to &quot;neck protector&quot;. This word breaks down into two parts: &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;neck&quot;, which has counterparts in various languages like Old English, Old Norse, and Old High German, and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to cover or protect&quot;. The root of &quot;bergan&quot; comes from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root &quot;bhergh-&quot; meaning &quot;to hide or protect&quot;. Meanwhile, the word &quot;hals&quot; traces its origin to the PIE root &quot;kwel-&quot;, meaning &quot;to revolve or move around&quot;.

The term &quot;byrnie&quot; comes from the Old English word &quot;&quot;, which is connected to the Old Norse &quot;&quot; and the Gothic &quot;&quot;, all referring to a coat of mail. Similarly, in Old High German, the word &quot;brunnia&quot; carries the same meaning. It is also related to the Old Irish word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;breast&quot;.

== History ==

=== Biblical references ===
In the Hebrew Bible the shiryon, translated &quot;habergeon&quot; or a &quot;coat of mail,&quot; is mentioned as part of the armor of Nehemiah&#x27;s workers, and one of the pieces of armor supplied by King Uzziah to his soldiers. Goliath was also armed with a &quot;coat of mail&quot;, weighing five thousand shekels (), as he confronted David.

=== Invention and spread of mail armor ===
Mail armor, consisting of interwoven metal rings, is credited by some, including Varro, as having been invented by the Celts. Archaeological evidence supports this, with notable finds like the Ciumești Celtic grave, containing a mail hauberk made of butted rings. This type of body armor was widely adopted due to its flexibility and ease of movement compared to other armor types. The Celts are said to have used mail armor, though it was expensive and likely limited to the wealthier members of society, such as chieftains and officers. The armor spread throughout Europe and Asia, becoming a popular form of protection, particularly among the Roman legions.

=== Development of the hauberk ===
The will of Eberhard of Friuli, an important figure of the Carolingian Empire, includes the term &quot;helmum cum hasbergha&quot;, likely referring to a helmet with a neck protector. While &quot;hasbergha&quot; later came to mean a shirt of mail, in the 9th century it likely referred to a neck guard, as suggested by its etymology and historical finds like the Spangenhelm and Anglo-Saxon helmets with mail curtains for neck protection. Initially made from leather to protect the neck and throat, it gradually evolved into more comprehensive armor, incorporating mail and extending to cover the head, neck, and shoulders.

By the 10th century, the hauberk was common among well-armored warriors, often paired with a helmet. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the hauberk merged with the mail shirt, forming a single protective garment that reached the knees, offering better defense against weapons. Such armor was quite expensive due to the cost of materials, such as iron wire, and the time and skill required for its manufacture. As a result, common foot soldiers were rarely equipped with it. By the mid-12th century, hauberks had expanded to include longer sleeves and more protection for the legs.

=== Depictions in the Bayeux Tapestry ===
The Bayeux Tapestry depicts Norman soldiers, both cavalry and infantry, wearing a knee-length version of the hauberk, with three-quarter length sleeves and a split from hem to crotch to allow for easier movement, especially while riding, which evolved from the Carolingian byrnie. Hauberks were likely worn over heavy padded undergarments called a gambeson, which helped prevent bruising from weapon blows. While some figures are shown with additional protection for their forearms and colored bands around the sleeves, most soldiers lack arm and leg armor, though leaders like William the Conqueror wore mail leggings called chausses. Several Norman horsemen, including William, are depicted with colored rectangles on the breast of their hauberks.

In the 11th century, men-at-arms likely did not wear full mail trousers, but the hauberk appears to have incorporated cloth or leather inserts that offered comparable protection. Additionally, it included a mail hood that covered the head, neck, and throat, leaving an opening for the face similar to a modern balaclava. Beneath this hood, padding made from cloth or leather was used for extra comfort and protection, while a pointed iron helmet with a nose-guarding bar, called a nasal, was worn over it. A Norman knight&#x27;s defensive gear included a large, kite-shaped shield that stood almost two-thirds as tall as its bearer. Its considerable size reflected the partial protection provided by the hauberk.

=== Surviving examples and later use ===
A hauberk stored in the Prague Cathedral and dating from the 12th century is one of the earliest surviving examples from Central Europe, and was supposedly owned by Saint Wenceslaus. In Europe, use of mail hauberks continued up through the 14th century, when plate armor began to supplant it. Some knights continued to wear chain hauberks, however, underneath plate armor. It remained in usage until the Renaissance. In parts of Central Asia, it continued to be used for a longer time.

== Construction ==

Hauberks were typically constructed from interlocking metal loops forming a mail shirt. The rings were riveted together piece by piece, forming a complete tissue of iron, and were called &quot;grains d’orge&quot; due to their resemblance to barley grains. The sleeves sometimes only went to the elbow, but often were full arm length, with some covering the hands with a supple glove leather face on the palm of the hand, or even full mail gloves. It was usually thigh or knee length, with a split in the front and back to the groin so the wearer could ride a horse. It sometimes incorporated a hood, or coif. Per historian Kelly DeVries &quot;the hauberk was probably worn over, but not attached to, a heavy, quilted undergarment, the haubergeon.&quot;

Early versions of the hauberk existed in various forms, such as the ringed hauberk where metal rings were sewn onto leather or padded material. Other types included the &quot;rustred&quot; hauberk with overlapping rings, the &quot;macled&quot; coat made of metal plates, and the trellised coat reinforced with nail-heads. A larger, more complex version, the jazerant or &quot;korazin&quot;, featured overlapping metal plates in an imbricated fashion. Eventually, mail hauberks, made entirely of interlocking iron rings, became common. These hauberks were crafted in either single or double mail, where each ring connected to four others.

While lighter than plate armor, a hauberk could be quite heavy. William of Poitiers, the author of the &quot;Gesta Guillemi&quot;, praises William the Conqueror&#x27;s strength by describing that &quot;he carried on his own shoulders both his own hauberk and that of one of his own followers, William FitzOsbern, renowned for his bodily strength and courage, whom he had relieved of this iron burden.&quot;

== In literature ==

In the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the poet draws attention to the protective armor worn by both Wiglaf and Beowulf at key moments. When Wiglaf enters the dragon&#x27;s lair, the focus is on his byrnie. Similarly, when Beowulf sinks into Grendel&#x27;s lair, the poet highlights his coat of mail, emphasizing the importance of armor in their heroic confrontations.

This French epic poem the &quot;Song of Roland&quot; describes the Battle of Roncevaux Pass and includes detailed descriptions of knights&#x27; armaments. The hauberk is frequently mentioned as part of the warriors&#x27; gear: &quot;For with my own eyes I saw four hundred thousand armed men, clad in their hauberks and many of them with closed helmets, girded with swords whose pommels were of chased gold, who accompanied him as far as the sea.&quot;

Chaucer refers to both hauberks and haubergeons in &quot;The Canterbury Tales,&quot; in &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; he describes: &quot;Gold-hewen helmes, hauberkes, cote-armures&quot;.

In this classic Arthurian text, &quot;Le Morte d’Arthur&quot; by Sir Thomas Malory, knights wear hauberks when they go into battle: &quot;Balyn hyt hym thorugh the sheld / and the hauberk perysshed&quot;.

In William Morris&#x27; &quot;The House of the Wolfings&quot;, Thiodolf, a formidable warrior with divine lineage, rises to defend his people against a Roman invasion. His valkyrie lover presents him with a dwarf-forged, enchanted hauberk for protection. However, Thiodolf soon learns that the armor weakens his leadership and causes him to falter in battle. Realizing its detrimental effect, he abandons the hauberk, choosing to sacrifice his life to save his people. In the end, his people rally to a crushing victory over the Roman forces, ensuring the preservation of their culture and way of life. In Morris&#x27; &quot;The Roots of the Mountains&quot;, a female warrior is linked to receiving a gift of armor. Here, it is Bow-may who requests a hauberk and helm crafted by Goldmane&#x27;s father. Iron-face presents her with &quot;a hauberk of ring-mail of his own fashioning&quot;, which fills her with immense joy as she can hardly stop marveling at the craftsmanship of the ring-mail.

Tolkien, inspired by medieval literature and history, frequently references hauberks in his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. Most notably, Frodo Baggins is gifted a shirt made of mithril by Bilbo. The Ringwraiths are also depicted as wearing hauberks.

<text>The UEFA Europa League (previously known as the UEFA Cup), abbreviated as UEL, is an annual football club competition organised since 1971 by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) for eligible European football clubs. It is the second-tier competition of European club football, ranking below the UEFA Champions League and above the UEFA Conference League.

Introduced in 1971 as the UEFA Cup, it replaced the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The UEFA Cup was the third-tier European club competition from 1971 to 1999 before the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was discontinued, and it is still often referred to as the &quot;C3&quot; in reference to this. Clubs qualify for the competition based on their performance in their national leagues and cup competitions.

In 1999, the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was merged with the UEFA Cup and discontinued as a separate competition. From the 2004–05 season a group stage was added before the knockout phase. The competition took on its current name in 2009, following a change in format. The 2009 re-branding included a merge with the UEFA Intertoto Cup, producing an enlarged competition format, with an expanded group stage and a change in qualifying criteria. The winner of the UEFA Europa League qualifies for the UEFA Super Cup, for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Champions League since the 2014–15 season, entering at the group stage, and for the UEFA–CONMEBOL Club Challenge — a friendly cup against the winners of the CONMEBOL Copa Sudamericana — since 2023. In the 2024–25 season, the group stage was replaced with an expanded league phase.

Spanish clubs have the highest number of victories (14 wins), followed by teams from Italy (10 wins) and England (9 wins). The title has been won by 30 clubs, 14 of which have won it more than once. The most successful club in the competition is Sevilla, with seven titles. Colombian striker Radamel Falcao holds the record of most goals (17) scored in a single season of the tournament.

==History==

The UEFA Cup was preceded by the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which was a European football competition played between 1955 and 1971. The competition grew from 11 teams during the first edition (1955–58) to 64 teams by the last edition which was played in 1970–71. It was replaced by the UEFA Cup, a new seasonal confederation competition with different regulations, format and disciplinary committee.

The UEFA Cup was first played in the 1971–72 season, and ended with an all-English final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur, with Spurs taking the first honours. The competition has since gained greater prestige and interest from the mass media than the Fairs Cup. The title was retained by another English club, Liverpool, in 1973, who defeated Borussia Mönchengladbach in the final. Gladbach won the competition in 1975 and 1979, and reached the final in 1980. Feyenoord won the cup in 1974 after defeating Tottenham Hotspur 4–2 on aggregate (2–2 in London, 2–0 in Rotterdam). Liverpool won the competition for the second time in 1976 after defeating Club Brugge in the final.

During the 1980s, IFK Göteborg (1982 and 1987) and Real Madrid (1985 and 1986) won the competition twice each, with Anderlecht reaching two consecutive finals, winning in 1983 and losing to Tottenham Hotspur in 1984. 1989 saw the commencement of the Italian clubs&#x27; domination, when Diego Maradona&#x27;s Napoli defeated VfB Stuttgart. The 1990s started with two all-Italian finals, and in 1992, Torino lost the final to Ajax on the away goals rule. Juventus won the competition for a third time in 1993. Inter Milan kept the cup in Italy in 1994.

1995 saw a third all-Italian final, with Parma proving their consistency after two consecutive Cup Winners&#x27; Cup finals. The only final with no Italians in the 1990s was in 1996. Internazionale reached the final the following two years, losing in 1997 to Schalke 04 on penalties, and winning another all-Italian final in 1998, taking home the cup for the third time in only eight years. Parma won the cup in 1999, the last win of the Italian-domination era. It was the last UEFA Cup/Europa League final appearance for any Italian club until Internazionale reached the 2020 final.
The era of the 2000s began with victory for Galatasaray, the first Turkish team to win the trophy, defeating Arsenal. Liverpool won the competition for the third time in 2001. In 2002, Feyenoord became winners for the second time, defeating Borussia Dortmund. Porto triumphed in the 2003 and 2011 tournaments, with the latter victory against fellow Portuguese side Braga.

In 2004, the cup returned to Spain with Valencia being victorious. CSKA Moscow won in 2005. Sevilla succeeded on two consecutive occasions in 2006 and 2007, the latter in a final against fellow Spaniards Espanyol. Zenit Saint Petersburg won in 2008. Ukraine&#x27;s Shakhtar Donetsk, won in 2009, the first Ukrainian side to do so.

Since the 2009–10 season, the competition was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League. At the same time, the UEFA Intertoto Cup, UEFA&#x27;s third-tier competition, was discontinued and merged into the new Europa League.

Atlético Madrid won twice in three seasons, in 2010 and 2012, the latter in another all-Spanish final between them and Athletic Bilbao. In 2013, Chelsea became the first Champions League holders to win the UEFA Cup/Europa League the following year. In 2014, Sevilla won their third cup in eight years after defeating Benfica on penalties. In 2015, Sevilla won their fourth UEFA Cup/Europa League and, in an unprecedented feat, they defended their title a third year in a row beating Liverpool in the 2016 final, making them the most successful team in the history of the competition with five titles. Atlético won their third title in 2018. The 2019 all-London final between Chelsea and Arsenal was the first UEFA Cup/Europa League final between two teams from the same city. Sevilla added a record-extending sixth victory in 2020, after defeating Inter Milan, and won an unprecedented seventh title in 2023.

==Trophy==
The UEFA Cup, also known as the &quot;Coupe UEFA&quot;, is the trophy awarded annually by UEFA to the football club that wins the UEFA Europa League. Before the 2009–10 season, both the competition and the trophy were known as the &#x27;UEFA Cup&#x27;.

Before the competition was renamed the UEFA Europa League in the 2009–10 season, the UEFA regulations stated that a club could keep the original trophy for a year before returning it to UEFA. After its return, the club could keep a four-fifths scale replica of the original trophy. Upon their third consecutive win or fifth win overall, a club could retain the trophy permanently.

Under the new regulations, the trophy remains in UEFA&#x27;s keeping at all times. A full-size replica trophy is awarded to each winner of the competition. A club that wins three consecutive times or five times overall will receive a multiple-winner badge. As of 2016–17, only Sevilla has earned the honour to wear the multiple-winner badge, having achieved both of the prerequisites in 2016.

The trophy was designed and crafted by Silvio Gazzaniga, who also designed the FIFA World Cup Trophy, working for Bertoni, for the 1972 UEFA Cup Final. It weighs and is silver on a yellow marble plinth. tall, the cup is formed by a base with two onyx discs in which a band with the flags of the UEFA member nations is inserted. The lower part of the sculpture symbolises the stylised footballers and is surmounted by a hand-embossed slab.

==Anthem==
A musical theme for the competition, the Anthem, is played before every Europa League game at a stadium hosting such an event and before every television broadcast of a Europa League game as a musical element of the competition&#x27;s opening sequence.

The competition&#x27;s first anthem was composed by Yohann Zveig and recorded by the Paris Opera in early 2009. The theme for the re-branded UEFA Cup competition was first officially unveiled at the Grimaldi Forum on 28 August 2009 before the 2009–10 season group stage draw. A new anthem was composed by Michael Kadelbach and recorded in Berlin and was launched as part of the competition&#x27;s rebranding at the start of the 2015–16 season.

A new anthem created by MassiveMusic was composed for the start of the 2018–19 season. It is also used for UEFA Conference League matches.

==Format==

===Qualification===

Qualification for the competition is based on UEFA coefficients, with better entrance rounds being offered to the more successful nations. In practice, each association has a standard number of three berths (across both the Europa League and the Conference League), except:
* Nations ranked 51 to 55, which have two berths
* Liechtenstein, which qualifies only the Cup winners

Usually, each country&#x27;s places are awarded to teams who finish in various runners-up places in its top-flight league and the winner of the . Typically the teams qualifying via the league are those in the highest places not eligible for the UEFA Champions League; however, the Belgian league awards one place via a playoff between First A and First B teams. Before its discontinuation in 2020–21, France offered a place to the winners of the Coupe de la Ligue.

A team may qualify for European competitions through more than one route. In all cases, if a club is eligible to enter the UEFA Champions League then the Champions League place takes precedence and the club does not enter the UEFA Europa League. The UEFA Europa League place is then granted to another club or vacated if the maximum limit of teams qualifying for European competitions is exceeded. If a team qualifies for European competition through both winning a cup and league placing, the &quot;spare&quot; UEFA Europa League place will go to the highest placed league team which has not already qualified for European competition, depending on the rules of the national association, or vacated, if the described limit is reached.

The top three ranked associations may qualify for a fourth berth if both the Champions League and Europa League champions are from that association and do not qualify for European competition through their domestic performance. In that case, the fourth-placed team in that association will join the Europa League instead of the Champions League, in addition to their other qualifying teams.

More recently, clubs that are knocked out of the qualifying round and (prior to 2024–25) the group stage of the Champions League can also join the UEFA Europa League, at different stages (see below). Formerly, the reigning champions qualified for the Europa League to defend their title, but since 2015 they qualify for the Champions League.
From the 2024–25 season, the winner of the Europa League can no longer defend their title as they automatically qualify for the Champions League league phase and teams cannot be transferred from that phase to the Europa League. From 1995 to 2015, three leagues gained one extra place via the UEFA Respect Fair Play ranking.

===League phase and knockout phase===
The format involves a league phase and a knockout phase consisting of preliminary knockout play-offs, followed by a round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and final (all of the knockout games except the final are played over two legs). The league phase consists of each team playing a total of eight matches, with four at home and four away. The top eight teams from the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16, while the teams ranked 9th to 24th contest the knockout play-offs with the winners advancing to the round of 16. The teams ranked 25th to 36th in the league phase and the losers of the play-offs are eliminated from the competition.

The final is played at a neutral venue. The winner of the competition is entitled to participate in the UEFA Champions League league phase the following season. The competition&#x27;s matches are usually played on Thursdays.

===Background===
UEFA coefficients were introduced in 1980 and, until 1999, they gave a greater number of berths in UEFA Cup to the more successful nations. Three nations had four places, five nations had three places, thirteen nations had two places, and eleven nations only one place. Since 1998, a similar system has been used for the UEFA Champions League. Before 1980, the entrance criteria of the last Fairs Cup was used.

===Historical formats===
The competition was traditionally a pure knockout tournament. All ties were two-legged, including the final. Starting with the 1997–98 season, the final became a one-off match, but all other ties remained two-legged.

Before the 2004–05 season, the tournament consisted of one qualifying round, followed by a series of knockout rounds. The sixteen non-qualifiers from the final qualifying round of the Champions League entered at the first round proper; later in the tournament, the survivors were joined by third-place finishers from the (first) group stage of the Champions League.

From the 2004–05 season, the competition started with two knockout qualifying rounds held in July and August. Participants from associations ranked 18 and lower entered the first qualifying round with those from associations ranked 9–18 joining them in the second qualifying round. In addition, three places in the first qualifying round were reserved for the UEFA Fair Play ranking winners (until 2015–16), and eleven places in the second qualifying round for the UEFA Intertoto Cup winners.

Winners of the qualifying rounds then joined teams from the associations ranked 1–13 in the first round proper. In addition, non-qualifiers in the third qualifying round of the Champions League also joined the competition at this point along with the current title-holders (unless they had qualified for the Champions League via their national league), for a total of 80 teams in the first round.

After the first knockout round, the 40 survivors entered a group stage, with the clubs being drawn into eight groups of five each. Unlike the Champions League group stage, the UEFA Cup group stage was played in a single round-robin format, with each club playing two home and two away games. The top three teams in each of the eight groups qualified for the main knockout round along with the eight third-placed teams in the Champions League group stage. From then on a series of two-legged knockout ties were played before a single-legged final, traditionally held on a Wednesday in May, exactly one week before the Champions League final.
In the 2009–10 season, the competition was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League to raise its profile. Eight more teams qualified for the group stage, which consisted of 12 groups with four teams each (in a double round-robin); the top two teams in each group advanced. The competition was then similar to the previous format, with four rounds of two-legged knockout rounds and a one-off final held at a neutral ground which met UEFA&#x27;s Category Four stadium criteria. Matches are generally played on Thursdays. The final was played in May, on the Wednesday ten days before the Champions League final.

Qualification changed significantly. Associations ranked 7–9 in the UEFA coefficients sent the cup winners and three (two since the 2015–16 season) other teams to the UEFA Europa League qualification; all other nations sent a cup winner and two other teams, except for Andorra and San Marino (who sent a cup winner and a runner-up) and Liechtenstein (who sent only a cup winner). Since Gibraltar was accepted as a full UEFA member at the 24 May 2013 UEFA Congress in London, their cup winner also qualified for the Europa League.

Although the other teams were the next-highest-ranked in each domestic league (after those qualifying for the UEFA Champions League), France and England continued to use one spot for their league-cup winners. With the abolition of the Intertoto Cup, all participants in the Europa League are qualified through domestic routes. The higher an association is ranked in the UEFA coefficients, the later its members begin the qualification. However, every team except for the title-holder (until the 2014–15 season) and the highest-ranked (the cup winner or the best Europa League-qualified) from the top (six from 2012 to 2015, 12 since the 2015–16 season) associations had to play at least one qualification round.

Except for the teams mentioned, all teams eliminated in the Champions League preliminary round, qualifying rounds and play-off round were transferred to the Europa League. The 12 winners and runners-up in the group stage advanced to the knockout round, with eight third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage.

The distribution was changed in 2014 to broaden the competition&#x27;s appeal, giving the Europa League champions a Champions League qualification berth, more teams automatically qualified for the group stage. If cup winners had already qualified for European competition through league performance, their place in the league is vacated and goes to the best-ranked teams not qualified for European competition; the cup runner-up is no longer qualified through the cup berth. These rules became effective for the 2015–16 season.

===Distribution (from 2018–19 to 2020–21)===
Beginning with the 2018–19 tournament, all domestic champions eliminated in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League will transfer to the Europa League, rather than just teams that are eliminated in the third-qualifying and play-off rounds. Europa League qualifying will also provide a separate champions route for these teams, allowing more opportunities for domestic league champions to compete against each other.

If the Europa League title holders already qualified for the Champions League group stage via their domestic league, the following changes to the access list would be made:

* The cup winners of association 18 entered the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round.
* The cup winners of association 25 entered the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round.
* The cup winners of associations 50 and 51 entered the first qualifying round instead of the preliminary round.

===Distribution (from 2021–22 to 2023–24)===
The announcement of the UEFA Europa Conference League, a tertiary competition which would serve to split off the lower-ranked teams in the Europa League to give them a greater chance to compete, included a document from UEFA listing their intentions for qualification to the Europa League from 2021 onwards. With a majority of the former entrants into the Europa League now participating solely in the UECL, the Europa League itself would have a greatly reduced format which will focus primarily around its group stage. There would also be an additional knockout round before the knockout phase proper, allowing for third-placed teams in the Champions League group stage to fall into the Europa League while still keeping the knockout stage itself at only 16 teams total.
Changes would be made if the Europa Conference League title holders qualified through their league position:

* The cup winners of association 7 enter the group stage instead of the play-off round.
* The cup winners of association 15 enter the play-off round instead of the third qualifying round.
* The cup winners of association 17 enter the third qualifying round instead of the Europa Conference League second qualifying round.

===Distribution (from 2024–25)===


Changes will be made to the access list above if the Europa League or Conference League title holder qualifies for the tournament via their domestic leagues.
* If the Europa League title holders qualify for the league phase via their domestic league&#x27;s standard berth allocation, the best-ranked club in qualifying rounds (both champions path and league path) enters the league phase without leapfrogging, then associations in the UEFA coefficient ranking are promoted to later qualifying rounds, and teams of the highest-ranked associations in earlier rounds are also promoted accordingly.
* If the Conference League title holders qualify for the league phase via their domestic league&#x27;s standard berth allocation, the best-ranked club in qualifying rounds (both champions path and league path) enters the league phase without leapfrogging, then associations in the UEFA coefficient ranking are promoted to later qualifying rounds, and teams of the highest-ranked associations in earlier rounds are also promoted accordingly.
* If the Europa League or Conference League title holders qualify for the qualifying rounds via their domestic league, their spot in the qualifying rounds is vacated, and teams of the highest-ranked associations in earlier rounds are promoted accordingly.

==Prize money==
Similar to the UEFA Champions League, the prize money received by the clubs is divided into fixed payments based on participation and results, and variable amounts that depend of the value of their TV market.

For the 2021–22 season, group stage participation in the Europa League awarded a base fee of €3,630,000. A victory in the group pays €630,000 and a draw €210,000. Each group winner earns €1,100,000 and each runner-up €550,000. Reaching the knock-out stage triggered additional bonuses: €500,000 for the round of 32, €1,200,000 for the round of 16, €1,800,000 for the quarter-finals and €2,800,000 for the semi-finals. The losing finalists received €4,600,000 and the champions received €8,600,000.

==Sponsorship==
The UEFA Europa League is sponsored by seven multinational corporations, which share the same partners as the UEFA Conference League.

The tournament&#x27;s main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are:
* Just Eat Takeaway
* Hankook
** Laufenn
* Engelbert Strauss
* Swissquote
* Betano
* Lidl
* Flix SE

Decathlon&#x27;s Kipsta sub-brand is the official match ball supplier from the 2024–25 season onwards for a three-year period.

Since the inception of the Europa League brand, the tournament has used its own advertising hoardings (in that year they debuted in the round of 32) like the UEFA Champions League. LED hoardings made their debut in the 2012–13 final and appeared in the 2015–16 season from the round of 16. Since the same season, from the group stage onwards, teams are not allowed to show their own sponsors. They appeared in the 2018–19 season for selected matches in the group stages and the round of 32.

Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising, even if such sponsors conflict with those of the Europa League. Two sponsorships are permitted per jersey (plus that of the manufacturer), at the chest and the left sleeve. Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor, or on the back, either below the squad number or between the player name and the collar.

==Records and statistics==


The UEFA Cup finals were played over two legs until 1997. The first final, between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur, was played on 3 May 1972 in Wolverhampton and 17 May 1972 in London. The first leg was won 2–1 by Tottenham Hotspur. The second leg ended in a 1–1 draw, meaning that Tottenham Hotspur became the first UEFA Cup winners.

The one-match finals in pre-selected venues were introduced in 1998. A venue must meet or exceed UEFA Category three standards to host UEFA Cup finals. On two occasions, the final was played at a finalist&#x27;s home ground: Feyenoord defeated Borussia Dortmund at De Kuip, Rotterdam, in 2002, and Sporting CP lost to CSKA Moscow at their own Estádio José Alvalade, Lisbon, in 2005.

The last UEFA Cup final before it was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League was held at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul on 20 May 2009, when Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine beat Werder Bremen of Germany 2–1 after extra time.

The first final of the rebranded Europa League was played in 2010, when Atlético Madrid of Spain beat Fulham of England 2–1 after extra time.

<text>Popcorn (also called popped corn, popcorns, or pop-corn) is a variety of corn kernel which expands and puffs up when heated. The term also refers to the snack food produced by the expansion. It is one of the oldest snacks, with evidence of popcorn dating back thousands of years in the Americas. It is commonly eaten salted, sweetened, or with artificial flavorings. 

A popcorn kernel&#x27;s strong hull contains the seed&#x27;s hard, starchy shell endosperm with 14–20% moisture, which turns to steam as the kernel is heated. Pressure from the steam continues to build until the hull ruptures, allowing the kernel to forcefully expand, to 20 to 50 times its original size, and then cool.

Some strains of corn (taxonomized as &quot;Zea mays&quot;) are cultivated specifically as popping corns. The &quot;Zea mays&quot; variety &quot;everta&quot;, a special kind of flint corn, is the most common of these. Popcorn is one of six major types of corn, which includes dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, flour corn, and sweet corn.

== History ==

Corn was domesticated about 10,000 years ago, in what is now Mexico. Archaeologists discovered that people have known about popcorn for thousands of years. Fossil evidence from Peru suggests that corn was present there as early as 4,700 BCE, and popped there over 1,000 years ago. Between 2007 and 2011, evidence as early as 4,700 BCE for popping corn were discovered as macrofossil cobs at the Paredones and Huaca Prieta archaeological sites on the northern coast of Peru.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gwr/1stPop&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 and 1950, evidence as early as 3600 BCE for popping corn as ears of popcorn were discovered by Harvard anthropology graduate student Herbert W. Dick and Harvard botany graduate student Claude Earle Smith, Junior (1922–1987),&lt;ref name=&quot;si/CES&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thecrimson/Corn&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in a complex of rock shelters, dubbed the &quot;Bat Cave&quot;, in Catron County, west-central New Mexico, and attributed to the Ancestral Puebloan peoples, who maintained trade networks with peoples in tropical Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;votSW/catron&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 19th century, popping of the kernels was achieved by hand, on stove tops over flame. Kernels were sold on the East Coast of the United States under names such as &quot;Pearls&quot; or &quot;Nonpareil&quot;. The term &quot;popped corn&quot; first appeared in John Russell Bartlett&#x27;s 1848 &quot;Dictionary of Americanisms&quot;. Popcorn is an ingredient in Cracker Jack and, in the early years of the product, it was popped by hand.
Popcorn&#x27;s accessibility increased rapidly in the 1890s with Charles Cretors&#x27; invention of the popcorn maker. Cretors, a Chicago candy store owner, had created a number of steam-powered machines for roasting nuts and applied the technology to the corn kernels.

By the turn of the century, Cretors had created and deployed street carts equipped with steam-powered popcorn makers.During the Great Depression, popcorn was fairly inexpensive at 5–10 cents a bag and became popular. Thus, while other businesses failed, the popcorn business thrived and became a source of income for many struggling farmers and entrepreneurs, including the Redenbacher family, namesake of the Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s popcorn brand. During World War II, sugar rations diminished candy production, and Americans compensated by eating three times as much popcorn as they had before. The snack was popular at theaters, much to the initial displeasure of many of the theater owners, who thought it distracted from the films. Their minds eventually changed, however, and in 1938 a Midwestern theater owner named Glen W. Dickinson Sr. installed popcorn machines in the lobbies of his Dickinson theaters. Popcorn was more profitable than theater tickets, and at the suggestion of his production consultant, R. Ray Aden, Dickinson purchased popcorn farms and was able to keep ticket prices down. The venture was a success, and popcorn soon spread. The rise of television in the 1940s brought lower popcorn consumption as theater attendance fell. The Popcorn Institute (a trade association of popcorn processors) promoted popcorn consumption at home, bringing it back to previous levels.

 In 1970, Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s namesake brand of popcorn was launched. In 1981, General Mills received the first patent for a microwave oven popcorn bag; popcorn consumption saw an increase.

At least six localities (all in the Midwestern United States) claim to be the &quot;Popcorn Capital of the World;&quot;: Ridgway, Illinois; Valparaiso, Indiana; Van Buren, Indiana; Schaller, Iowa; Marion, Ohio; and North Loup, Nebraska. According to the USDA, specific corn for popcorn is grown mostly in Nebraska and Indiana, and increasingly in Texas. As the result of an elementary school project, popcorn became the official state snack food of Illinois.

== Popping mechanism ==
Each kernel of popcorn contains moisture and oil. Unlike most other grains, the outer hull of the popcorn kernel is strong and impervious to moisture, and the starch inside consists almost entirely of a hard type.
As the oil and water in the kernel are heated, they turn into steam. Under these conditions, the starch inside the kernel gelatinizes and softens. The steam pressure increases until the breaking point of the hull is reached; a pressure of approximately and a temperature of . The hull ruptures, causing a sudden drop in pressure inside the kernel and a corresponding rapid expansion of the steam, which expands the starch and proteins of the endosperm into airy foam. As the foam rapidly cools, the starch and protein polymers set into the familiar crispy puff.

Special varieties are grown to improve popping yield. Though the kernels of some other types will pop, the cultivated strain for popcorn is &quot;Zea mays everta,&quot; which is a variety of flint corn.

== Cooking methods ==


Popcorn can be cooked with butter or oil. Although small quantities can be popped in a stove-top kettle or pot in a home kitchen, commercial sale employs specially designed popcorn machines, which were invented in Chicago, Illinois, by Charles Cretors in 1885. Cretors introduced his invention at the Columbian Exposition in 1893. At that fair, F. W. Rueckheim introduced a molasses-flavored &quot;Candied Popcorn&quot;, the first caramel corn; his brother, Louis Ruekheim, slightly altered the recipe and introduced it as Cracker Jack in 1896.

Cretors&#x27;s invention was the first patented steam-driven machine that popped corn in oil. Previously, vendors popped corn by holding a wire basket over an open flame. At best, the result was hot, dry, and unevenly cooked. Cretors&#x27;s machine popped corn in a mixture of one-third clarified butter, two-thirds lard, and salt. This mixture can withstand the temperature needed to pop corn and produces little smoke. A fire under a boiler created steam that drove a small engine to drive gears, shaft, and the agitator that stirred the corn, and also powered a small puppet, &quot;The Toasty Roasty Man&quot;, an attention-getting amusement to attract business. A wire connected to the top of the cooking pan allowed the operator to disengage the drive mechanism, lift the cover, and dump popped corn into the storage bin beneath. Exhaust from the steam engine was piped to a pan below the corn storage bin and kept freshly popped corn warm. Excess steam was also used to operate a small, shrill whistle to attract attention.

A different method of popcorn-making involves the &quot;popcorn hammer&quot;, a large cast-iron canister that is sealed with a heavy lid and slowly turned over a fire in rotisserie fashion.

=== Expansion and yield ===
Popping results are sensitive to the rate at which the kernels are heated. If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high pressures and rupture the hull before the starch in the center of the kernel can fully gelatinize, leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers. Heating too slowly leads to entirely unpopped kernels: the tip of the kernel, where it attached to the cob, is not entirely moisture-proof, and when heated slowly, the steam can leak out of the tip fast enough to keep the pressure from rising sufficiently to break the hull and cause the pop.

Producers and sellers of popcorn consider two major factors in evaluating the quality of popcorn: what percentage of the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor. For the consumer, larger pieces of popcorn tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality. For the grower, distributor and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume. For these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per unit weight.

Popcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well; its high moisture content leads to poor expansion and chewy pieces of popcorn. Kernels with a high moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored. For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most. This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally in the range of 14–15% moisture by weight. If the kernels are over-dried, the expansion rate will suffer and the percentage of kernels that pop will decline. Old popcorn tends to dry out, lowering the yield.

When the popcorn has finished popping, sometimes unpopped kernels remain. Known in the popcorn industry as &quot;old maids&quot;, these kernels fail to pop because they do not have enough moisture to create enough steam for an explosion. Re-hydrating prior to popping usually results in eliminating the unpopped kernels.

Popcorn varieties are broadly categorized by the shape of the kernels, the color of the kernels, or the shape of the popped corn. While the kernels may come in a variety of colors, the popped corn is always off-yellow or white as it is only the hull (or pericarp) that is colored. &quot;Rice&quot; type popcorn have a long kernel pointed at both ends; &quot;pearl&quot; type kernels are rounded at the top. Commercial popcorn production has moved mostly to pearl types. Historically, pearl popcorn were usually yellow and rice popcorn usually white. Today both shapes are available in both colors, as well as others including black, red, mauve, purple, and variegated. Mauve and purple popcorn usually have smaller and nutty kernels. Commercial production is dominated by white and yellow.

== Terminology ==
In the popcorn industry, a popped kernel of corn is known as a &quot;flake&quot;. Two shapes of flakes are commercially important. &quot;Butterfly&quot; (or &quot;snowflake&quot;) flakes are irregular in shape and have a number of protruding &quot;wings&quot;. &quot;Mushroom&quot; flakes are largely ball-shaped, with few wings. Butterfly flakes are regarded as having better mouthfeel, with greater tenderness and less noticeable hulls. Mushroom flakes are less fragile than butterfly flakes and are therefore often used for packaged popcorn or confectionery, such as caramel corn. The kernels from a single cob of popcorn may form both butterfly and mushroom flakes; hybrids that produce 100% butterfly flakes or 100% mushroom flakes exist, the latter developed only as recently as 1998.

== Consumption ==
Popcorn is a popular snack food at sporting events and in movie theaters, where it has been served since the 1930s. Cinemas have come under fire due to their high markup on popcorn; Stuart Hanson, a film historian at De Montfort University in Leicester, once said, &quot;One of the great jokes in the industry is that popcorn is second only to cocaine or heroin in terms of profit.&quot;

Traditions differ as to whether popcorn is consumed as a hearty snack food with salt (predominating in the United States) or as a sweet snack food with caramelized sugar (predominating in Germany).
Popcorn smell has an unusually attractive quality for human beings. This is largely because it contains high levels of the chemicals 6-acetyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine and 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, very powerful aroma compounds that are also used by food and other industries either to make products that smell like popcorn, bread, or other foods containing the compound in nature, or for other purposes.

Popcorn as a breakfast cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s and generally consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener.

Popcorn balls (popped kernels stuck together with a sugary &quot;glue&quot;) were hugely popular around the turn of the 20th century, but their popularity has since waned. Popcorn balls are still served in some places as a traditional Halloween treat. Cracker Jack is a popular, commercially produced candy that consists of peanuts mixed in with caramel-covered popcorn. Kettle corn is a variation of normal popcorn, cooked with white sugar and salt, traditionally in a large copper kettle. Once reserved for specialty shops and county fairs, kettle corn has recently become popular, especially in the microwave popcorn market. The popcorn maker is a relatively new home appliance, and its popularity is increasing because it offers the opportunity to add flavors of the consumer&#x27;s own choice and to choose healthy-eating popcorn styles.

Popped sorghum is popular as a snack in India. The popped sorghum is similar to popcorn, but the puffs are smaller. Recipes for popping sorghum by microwave, in a pot, etc., are readily available online.

=== Nutritional value ===
Air-popped popcorn (no salt or other additives) is 4% water, 78% carbohydrates (including 15% dietary fiber), 12% protein, and 4% fat (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, popcorn provides 382 calories and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin (25% DV) and several dietary minerals, particularly manganese, phosphorus, and zinc (36–45% DV). B vitamins and other minerals are in appreciable amounts (table).

===Saturated fat===
Movie theaters commonly use coconut oil to pop the corn, and then top it with butter or margarine. Movie theater popcorn contains large amounts of saturated fats and sodium due to its method of preparation.

===Phytochemicals===
Sorghum grains can be popped to form popcorn. All sorghums contain phenolic acids, and most contain flavonoids. Sorghum grains are one of the highest food sources of the flavonoid proanthocyanidin.

=== Health risks ===
Popcorn is included on the list of foods that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends not serving to children under four, because of the risk of choking.

Microwaveable popcorn represents a special case, since it is designed to be cooked along with its various flavoring agents. One of these formerly common artificial-butter flavorants, diacetyl, has been implicated in causing respiratory illnesses in microwave popcorn factory workers, also known as &quot;popcorn lung&quot;. Major manufacturers in the United States have stopped using this chemical, including Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s, Act II, Pop Secret and Jolly Time.

== Other uses ==
Popcorn, threaded onto a string, is used as a wall or Christmas tree decoration in some parts of North America, as well as on the Balkan peninsula.

Some shipping companies have experimented with using popcorn as a biodegradable replacement for expanded polystyrene packing material. However, popcorn has numerous undesirable properties as a packing material, including attractiveness to pests, flammability, and a higher cost and greater density than expanded polystyrene. A more processed form of expanded corn foam has been developed to overcome some of these limitations, forming starch-based foam peanuts.

<text>Marylebone Road ( ) is an important thoroughfare in central London, within the City of Westminster. It runs east–west from the Euston Road at Regent&#x27;s Park to the A40 Westway at Paddington. The road which runs in three lanes in both directions, is part of the London Inner Ring Road and as such forms part of the boundary of the zone within which the London congestion charge applies.

As part of the ring road and a feeder route to the A40 (and hence the M40 motorway) (to the west) and the A5 and M1 motorway (to the north) much of the traffic leaving central London for the Midlands and the North of England travels on this road. It is frequently heavily congested.

==History==
The road was effectively London&#x27;s first bypass. Construction of the New Road, as it was called, began in 1756 along the northern edge of the built-up area. In 1857, the road&#x27;s name was changed from New Road, with sections, west to east, renamed Marylebone Road, Euston Road and Pentonville Road. 

The name Marylebone originates from a church, called &quot;St Mary Le Bon&quot;, that was built on the bank of a small stream or &quot;bourne&quot; called the tybourne, in an area named after the stream Tyburn. The church and the surrounding area later became known as St Mary at the bourne, which over time became shortened to its present form &quot;Marylebone&quot;. The current St Marylebone Parish Church is on the south of Marylebone Road, opposite the Royal Academy of Music and at the top of Marylebone High Street.

The crossroads of Marylebone Road and Baker Street was historically known as &quot;Marylebone Circus&quot;, which is still its unofficial name.

==Tourism==
One of London&#x27;s principal tourist attractions lies on Marylebone Road - Madame Tussauds. It is also the location of the Royal Academy of Music and the former &quot;Great Central Hotel&quot;, now renamed The Landmark London.

<doc id="232179" wikidata="Q179278" url="?curid=232179" title="Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford">
<text>Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford (; – 13 February 1542) was an English noblewoman. Her husband, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, was the brother of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII, and a cousin to King Henry VIII&#x27;s fifth wife Katherine Howard, making Jane a cousin-in-law. Jane had been a member of the household of Henry&#x27;s first wife, Katherine of Aragon. It is possible that she played a role in the verdicts against, and subsequent executions of, her husband and Anne Boleyn. She was later a lady-in-waiting to Henry&#x27;s third and fourth wives, and then to his fifth wife, Katherine Howard, with whom she was executed.

==Early life==
Born Jane Parker, she was the daughter of Henry Parker, 10th Baron Morley, and Alice St. John, great-granddaughter of Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso. Through Margaret, Jane was a distant relation of King Henry VIII — specifically his half-second-cousin – and this, in turn, made her a second cousin once removed of all of the King&#x27;s children, including her niece-by-marriage, Elizabeth I. She was born in Norfolk around the year 1505; her family were wealthy, well-connected, politically active and respected members of the English nobility. Her father was an intellectual, with a great interest in culture and education. She was sent to the royal court in her early teens, certainly before her fifteenth birthday, where she joined the household of King Henry VIII&#x27;s first wife, Katherine of Aragon. She is recorded as having accompanied the royal party on the state visit to France in 1520, &quot;The Field of the Cloth of Gold&quot;.

Although it has long been supposed that nothing is recorded of Jane&#x27;s appearance (and there is no surviving portrait that can be identified as her), her biographer Julia Fox, in &quot;Jane Boleyn: The Infamous Lady Rochford&quot;, suggests that there is a very remote chance that a Holbein painting represents a likeness of Jane. Meanwhile, she considers &quot;the best impression we can have of Jane Rochford is Holbein’s drawings of an unknown woman in Tudor dress&quot; (pp. 317–319). She was probably considered attractive, given that she was chosen to appear as one of the lead actresses/dancers in the prestigious &quot;Château Vert&quot; masquerade at Court in 1522. The seven performers were selected from the ladies of court in large part for their attractiveness, including the King&#x27;s sister Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France. Two of the other performers included Jane&#x27;s future sisters-in-law, Anne and Mary Boleyn.

==Marriage==

In late 1524 or early 1525, she was married to George Boleyn (later Viscount Rochford), brother of Anne Boleyn, who later became the second queen of Henry VIII. At this stage, however, Anne was not completely attached to the King, although she was already one of the leaders of fashionable society.

As a wedding present, King Henry gave Jane and George Grimston Manor in Norfolk. Since she gained the courtesy title of Viscountess Rochford in 1529 when her husband was made a viscount, she was usually known at court (and by subsequent historians) as &quot;Lady Rochford&quot;. As the Boleyn family&#x27;s wealth and influence increased, the couple were given the Palace of Beaulieu in Essex as their chief residence, which George and Jane decorated with a lavish chapel, a tennis court, a bathroom with hot-and-cold running water, imported carpets, mahogany furniture and their own large collection of silverware. Their marital bed was draped in cloth of gold with a white satin canopy, linen quilts and a yellow counterpane. Beaulieu had initially belonged to the Boleyns as one of their country retreats before they sold it to the King, who spent over £17,000 lavishly refurbishing and expanding it. In the early 1530s, it became the main residence of his eldest daughter, Mary, but when she was banished to Hatfield House, Viscount Rochford was given the house to live in, although the deeds were never formally signed over.

Traditionally, George and Jane&#x27;s marriage has been portrayed as an unhappy one. One modern historian has suggested that George was homosexual. British historian Alison Weir concludes that the marriage was unhappy, principally because of George, although she concludes that the exact nature of his sexuality is difficult to ascertain: &quot;[A] talented young man ... he was very good-looking and very promiscuous. In fact, according to George Cavendish, he lived in &#x27;bestial&#x27; fashion, forcing widows, deflowering virgins ... [and] it has been suggested he indulged in homosexual activity too, but there is no evidence for this, although he may well have committed buggery with female partners.&quot; Julia Fox, Jane&#x27;s most recent biographer, disagrees with both arguments, concluding that the exact nature of the marriage is unclear but suggesting that it was by no means unhappy.

The exact nature of her relationship with her royal sister-in-law Anne is not clear either, and there is no evidence as to what she thought of her other sister-in-law, Mary Boleyn, who had been at court with Jane since they were both teenagers. It has been historically assumed that Jane was not overly fond of Anne, allegedly because of Jane&#x27;s jealousy of her.

===Role in husband&#x27;s execution===
After 11 years of marriage, George Boleyn was arrested in May 1536 and imprisoned in the Tower of London, accused of having had sexual intercourse with his sister Queen Anne. Elizabeth Somerset, Countess of Worcester, is said by contemporaries to have provided the evidence against the Queen and her brother. There was no truth in these rumours, according to the vast majority of contemporary witnesses, but they provided the legal pretext that the Boleyns&#x27; enemies needed to bring about the execution of Lord Rochford. Jane was mentioned only once during the trials, when George Boleyn was asked if the Queen had relayed information about Henry&#x27;s sexual troubles to her.

The first mention of any tensions between Jane and her husband came long after their deaths, when George Wyatt called her &quot;wicked wife, accuser of her own husband, even to the seeking of his own blood,&quot; in his biography of Queen Anne, but this view would have been informed by the later Katherine Howard episode, when both she and the Queen were executed for treason, and Wyatt&#x27;s own attempts to exonerate the late Queen Anne. Subsequent generations of historians also believed that Jane&#x27;s testimony against her husband and sister-in-law in 1536 was motivated by spite rather than any actual belief in their guilt, hence her generally unfavourable historical reputation. A century later, an historian asserted that Jane had testified against them because of her &quot;inveterate hatred&quot; of Queen Anne, which sprang from envy of Anne&#x27;s superior social skills and George&#x27;s preference for his sister&#x27;s company to that of his wife. This assertion is not consistent with the records of the period; not only is there no mention of any serious rift between the couple (and the few mentions of their marriage imply at least a tolerable relationship), but by the time of the death of Jane Seymour, Jane Rochford had already rebuilt her reputation at court and been one of the Queen&#x27;s chief mourners. Georgian and Victorian histories pointed to Jane&#x27;s execution in 1542 to suggest that moral justice had triumphed because &quot;the infamous Lady Rochford ... justly deserved her fate for the concern which she had in bringing Anne Boleyn, as well as her own husband, to the block&quot;. This view of Jane as accuser, despite lacking historical proof, gained traction after her death, and was popularised by subsequent historians.

This negative view of Jane was rejected by her biographer, Julia Fox, who believes that Jane actually enjoyed a warm and supportive relationship with Queen Anne and that terror of the palace coup against the Boleyns in 1536 provoked Jane&#x27;s testimony, which in any case was twisted by the family&#x27;s enemies. In her 2007 book, Fox writes:
==Widowhood==
George Boleyn was beheaded on Tower Hill on 17 May 1536. His final speech was chiefly concerned with promoting his new-found Protestant faith. Four other men were executed alongside him, also accused of having been Anne&#x27;s lovers. Only one, Mark Smeaton, a musician, had confessed, and it was reported that he had been savagely tortured into doing so. Members of the aristocracy and gentry could not legally be tortured. Anne was executed two days later, beheaded by a French swordsman, on Tower Green. Anne&#x27;s poise and courage at the scaffold were much commented upon, and public opinion in the weeks and months after often &quot;made of Anne a persecuted heroine, bright with promise and goodness as a young woman, beautiful and elegant.&quot; It is not known whether Jane witnessed the execution of either her husband or her sister-in-law, but the posthumous sympathy Anne aroused in many meant that many of those linked to her fall were cast in the roles of villains. According to Julia Fox, this explains how Jane&#x27;s actions were construed as being those of a cruel and jealous intriguer.

The immediate aftermath of the fall of the Boleyns was hard for her, both socially and financially. The lands which the Boleyns had built up during Anne Boleyn&#x27;s reign and over the previous four generations, including the titles Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, were to pass through the male line only, and thus were lost to the family with George&#x27;s death. Jane continued to use the courtesy title of Viscountess Rochford but without a son she could not benefit from what remained of the Boleyn family fortune. (Modern rumours that George Boleyn, Dean of Lichfield, a colourful character, was the child of Jane and George are now thought to be false.)

===Later political intrigues===

After her husband&#x27;s execution, Lady Rochford was absent from court for several months. She spent this time securing her financial position by negotiations with her father-in-law, Sir Thomas Boleyn, but mainly with Thomas Cromwell. The Boleyns eventually allocated her an annual pension of £100, precisely what they had given Mary Boleyn when she had been widowed eight years earlier. It was much less than her previous income, but it was enough to keep her as a noblewoman, which was essential for her return to court, something Jane worked doggedly for. It is unknown when she returned to court, but she was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Jane Seymour, so she probably returned within a year of her husband&#x27;s death. As a viscountess, she was allowed to bring a number of her own servants with her, lodge in the King&#x27;s palaces, and be addressed as &quot;Lady Rochford&quot;.

Following Jane Seymour&#x27;s death, the King subsequently married Anne of Cleves, a German princess recommended by Cromwell. However, Henry soon wanted to be rid of Anne, and sought an annulment. In July 1540, Lady Rochford testified that the Queen had confided in her that the marriage had never been consummated. This allowed the King to annul the marriage and marry Katherine Howard, who was related to the Boleyn family through the Howards.

Lady Rochford kept her post as lady-in-waiting, now to Queen Katherine. Queen Katherine&#x27;s past indiscretions were uncovered in the autumn of 1541, and her private life was investigated. The Queen was first detained in her apartments and then placed under house arrest at Syon Abbey, a disused convent. Her confidantes and favourites were questioned and their rooms searched. Lady Rochford was herself detained for questioning, implicated in arranging meetings between the Queen and Thomas Culpeper. Jane Rochford was interviewed on 13 November 1541.

After her arrest, an inventory was made over her possessions.

===Downfall and execution===

During her imprisonment in the Tower, Lady Rochford was interrogated but was not tortured. However, she seems to have suffered a nervous breakdown and by the beginning of 1542 was pronounced insane. Her &quot;fits of frenzy&quot; meant that legally she could not stand trial for her role in facilitating the Queen&#x27;s alleged adultery, but since he was determined to have her punished, the King implemented a law which allowed the execution of the insane for high treason. Jane was thus condemned to death by an Act of Attainder, and the execution date was set for 13 February 1542, the same day as Queen Katherine&#x27;s execution.

The Queen died first, apparently in a weak physical state, although she was not hysterical. Jane was then escorted from her lodgings to the scaffold where she spoke before kneeling on the just-used scaffold. Despite her nervous collapse over the previous months, she was calm and dignified and both women won mild posthumous approval for their behaviour. One eyewitness, a merchant named Ottwell Johnson, wrote that their &#x27;souls [must] be with God, for they made the most godly and Christian end.&#x27; The French ambassador Charles de Marillac merely stated that Jane gave a &#x27;long discourse&#x27;; Johnson says that she apologised for her &#x27;many sins&#x27;, but neither man&#x27;s account supports the later legend that she spoke at length about her late husband or sister-in-law.

Jane was beheaded with a single blow of the axe and was buried in the church of St Peter ad Vincula within the Tower of London alongside Queen Katherine, close to the bodies of Anne Boleyn and Jane&#x27;s husband George Boleyn.

==In fiction and media==

===Literature===
Lady Rochford has appeared in numerous novels, especially those on Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. &quot;Vengeance Is Mine&quot; by Brandy Purdy is written from Lady Rochford&#x27;s viewpoint. She also features in Robin Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn&quot;, Suzannah Dunn&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Subtleties&quot; and briefly in Margaret George&#x27;s &quot;The Autobiography of Henry VIII&quot;. Jane&#x27;s character is also mentioned in Wendy J. Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Dear Heart, How Like You This?&quot; which is based on the life of the poet Thomas Wyatt. Rochford is a minor character in &quot;Sovereign&quot;, the third instalment of C. J. Sansom&#x27;s Shardlake series of murder mystery novels. A larger role is given to Lady Rochford in Jean Plaidy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rose Without a Thorn.&quot; Jane Rochford also appears in the Thomas Cromwell trilogy by Hilary Mantel.
Jane appears in the historical novel &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; by Philippa Gregory, which tells the story of her other sister-in-law, Mary Boleyn. One of its sequels is &quot;The Boleyn Inheritance&quot;, which casts Lady Rochford as one of its lead characters and its central villain. It details the final three years of her life and her involvement with Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. &quot;The Raven&#x27;s Widow&quot; by Adrienne Dillard takes a much different tack to previous portrayals. Lady Rochford is shown as a beloved wife and close friend to the Boleyns, her later role in the relationship between Katherine Howard and Thomas Culpeper coming about because of the trauma of her husband&#x27;s death and the knowledge that disobedience comes at a price.

===Film and TV===
In the 1970 BBC series &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; starring Keith Michell as Henry, Sheila Burrell portrayed Lady Rochford.

In the &quot;2003 TV drama Henry VIII&quot;, Lady Rochford was played by Kelly Hunter. In the film adaptation of Philippa Gregory&#x27;s novel &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;, Jane Boleyn (played by Juno Temple) was a minor character. In both these representations, Jane was shown as being a political tool in the hands of her husband&#x27;s uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, although the presentation of her in &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; was more sympathetic. In the 2003 TV adaptation of Gregory&#x27;s novel, Jane was played by Zoe Waites.

Jane is also represented in seasons two to four of the Showtime series &quot;The Tudors,&quot; by Joanne King with Padraic Delaney playing her husband George. In this version, their marriage is miserable, with both pressured into it by their parents and Jane finding it increasingly humiliating to put up with her husband&#x27;s affair with Mark Smeaton. They are shown frequently arguing and there is one incident of marital rape. However, Jane is not shown as hating Anne and so her betrayal of the Boleyns is motivated by her hatred of George. She befriends Jane Seymour when she becomes Queen, is made her lady-in-waiting and remains a close friend until Queen Jane&#x27;s death. She remains chief lady-in-waiting, first to Anne of Cleves and then Katherine Howard. She eventually enters into a sexual relationship with Thomas Culpeper, for which there is no known historical basis. She facilitates the affair between Culpeper and Katherine, motivated both by a desire to keep Culpeper (who has a pathological obsession with the young Queen) and out of contempt for Katherine.

In &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, a TV mini-series adaptation of the historical novel by Hilary Mantel, she was played by Jessica Raine. Her portrayal, while consistent with negative depictions of her, also stems from the disrespect and neglect she is shown experiencing from both Anne and George Boleyn, which makes her a ready accomplice to the intrigues of Thomas Cromwell.

In Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, she was played by Lydia Leonard. Lydia Leonard starred in the stage adaptation of Hilary Mantel&#x27;s Bring Up the Bodies.

<text>A convict is &quot;a person found guilty of a crime and sentenced by a court&quot; or &quot;a person serving a sentence in prison&quot;. Convicts are often also known as &quot;prisoners&quot; or &quot;inmates&quot; or by the slang term &quot;con&quot;, while a common label for former convicts, especially those recently released from prison, is &quot;ex-con&quot; (&quot;ex-convict&quot;). Persons convicted and sentenced to non-custodial sentences tend not to be described as &quot;convicts&quot;.

The label of &quot;ex-convict&quot; usually has lifelong implications, such as social stigma or reduced opportunities for employment. The federal government of Australia, for instance, will not, in general, employ an ex-convict, while some state and territory governments may limit the time for or before which a former convict may be employed.

==Historical usage==
The particular use of the term &quot;convict&quot; in the English-speaking world was to describe the huge numbers of criminals, both male and female, who clogged British gaols in the 18th and early 19th century. Their crimes would today be regarded as petty misdemeanors (stealing small items or food), or are no longer in the criminal code (such as being in unresolved debt). Most of the punishments at this time were severe, with the death penalty (hanging) applied for fairly minor crimes. However, this ultimate sentence was often commuted to a lesser one, commonly for transportation (for 7 or 14 years, or for life) to the colonies. Thus, in the British context, the term &quot;convict&quot; has come to refer in particular to those criminals transported overseas.

Initially many British convicts were sent to the American colonies, such as Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia, as cheap labour. The transportation of convicts from the United Kingdom began around 1615 and became increasingly common in the following years. Initially most people were transported to North America or the West Indies, but from 1718 onwards transportation was entirely to North America. The arrangements ceased when the American Revolutionary War meant it was no longer possible for the United Kingdom to send convicts to what had become the United States.

The British Government then looked to the newly discovered east coast of Australia to use as a penal colony. Convicts were transported to Australia in 1787, arriving in Botany Bay, then Sydney Cove, in January 1788. From the very start of European settlement convicts were used as indentured labourers in five out of the six colonies. Many were used on public works, but a significant number were &quot;assigned&quot; to private individuals as domestic servants, rural workers, etc. Transportation was progressively abolished from 1853, eventually ceasing altogether in 1868.

In Australia, convicts have come to be key figures of cultural mythology and historiography. Many became prominent businesspeople and respected citizens, and some prominent families in present-day Australian society can trace their origins to convict ancestors who rose above their humble origins. However, during the transportation era and for many years after, previous convicts and their descendants tended to hide their former criminal background, sometimes resulting in distorted or completely missing family history. Extensive and comprehensive records kept on every individual are now able to fill in the gaps; and, in fact, many family historians can find out more about their convict ancestors than they can about those who arrived in Australia as free settlers.

British convicts were also sent to Canada, West Africa, and India. France also sent convicts to New Caledonia and to Devil&#x27;s Island in French Guiana.

<doc id="232182" wikidata="Q171799" url="?curid=232182" title="Dhow">
<text>Dhow (; ) is the generic name of a number of traditional sailing vessels with one or more masts with settee or sometimes lateen sails, used in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean region. Typically sporting long thin hulls, dhows are trading vessels primarily used to carry heavy items, such as fruit, fresh water, or other heavy merchandise, along the coasts of Eastern Arabia, Iran, East Africa, Yemen and coastal South Asia (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh). Larger dhows have crews of approximately thirty and smaller ones typically around twelve.

== Etymology ==
There are several versions of the origin of the word &quot;dau&quot;. Previously, it was believed that it could be of Arabic or Persian origin (and although in the 21st century there is no such word in either Arabic or Persian, some Dutch documents from the 17th-18th centuries indicate that then the Persian word &quot;dawh&quot; meant &quot;small ship&quot;). Recently, most researchers are inclined to believe that this term comes from the language of the East African Swahili people, in which &quot;daw&quot; means &quot;vessel&quot;.

However, regardless of the sources of its origin, the use of &quot;dhow&quot; as a collective term to refer to the boats of the Indian Ocean with characteristic &quot;Arabian&quot; sails, was introduced definitely by Europeans. Since in the European tradition ships were classified mainly according to their sailing equipment, all the ships of the Indian Ocean that carried similar Arabian sails and looked more or less the same to the untrained European eye were known to as Europeans using a single word, &quot;dhow&quot;. At the same time, neither the Arabs nor the Indians use the term &quot;dhow&quot; to refer to their vessels collectively. The collective terms used in Arabic for ships are &quot;markab&quot; or &quot;khashab&quot;, and the Qur&#x27;an uses the term &quot;fulk.&quot; On the other hand, the peoples of the Indian Ocean use separate special names for each type of ship, differing from each other mainly not in sailing rigging, but in size, hull design and number of masts

==History==
The exact origins of the dhow are lost to history. Most scholars believe that it originated in India from 600 BC to 600 AD, although there are some who claim that the sanbuk, a type of dhow, may be derived from the Portuguese caravel. However, Portuguese caravels only appeared in the area in the late 15th century.

The dhow was the ship of trade first used by the Somalis. The Somali people who are known to have the oldest surviving dhow which is called Beden, have traded with the ancient world from Egypt, Babylon, as well as the civilizations of the far east, carrying valuable frankincense, myrrh, gold, etc. It was the Somali merchants that first introduced exotic animals from Africa to the Ming Dynasty. The dhow was used to transport a giraffe to the Chinese Emperor Yong Le&#x27;s court, in 1414. Another source suggests the ship that carried the giraffe to China was part of a large Chinese fleet led by Zheng He.

Ships that are similar to the dhow are mentioned or described in the 1001 Nights including various ports where they harboured. The dhow is also associated with the pearl trade.

The Yemeni Hadhrami people, as well as Omanis, for centuries came to Beypore, in Kerala, India for their dhows. This was because of the good timber in the Kerala forests, the availability of good coir rope, and the skilled shipwrights. In former times, the sheathing planks of a dhow&#x27;s hull were held together by coconut rope. Beypore dhows are known as &#x27;Uru&#x27; in Malayalam, the local language of Kerala. Settlers from Yemen, known as &#x27;Baramis&#x27;, or &#x27;Daramis&#x27; which could be derived from the word &#x27;Hardamis&#x27; are still active in making urus in Kerala.

Dhows were extensively used for the Red Sea slave trade and the Indian Ocean slave trade, which the Royal Navy attempted to suppress. In his 1873 book, Captain G. L. Sulivan described &quot;four different kinds of coasting dhows, as shown in the engravings, viz. the Bateele, the Badane, Bugala or genuine Dhow, and the Matapa boat&quot;.

=== Since the 20th century ===

In the 1920s, British writers identified Al Hudaydah as the centre for dhow building. Those built in Al Hudaydah were smaller in size, and used for travel along the coasts. They were constructed of acacia found in Yemen. They are distinguishable for their smaller triangular sails on movable bases to harvest the irregular winds of the Red Sea.

Captain Alan Villiers (1903–1982) documented the days of sailing trade in the Indian Ocean by sailing on dhows between 1938 and 1939 taking numerous photographs and publishing books on the subject of dhow navigation.

Even to the present day, dhows make commercial journeys between the Persian Gulf and East Africa using sails as their only means of propulsion. Their cargo is mostly dates and fish to East Africa and mangrove timber to the lands in the Persian Gulf. They often sail south with the monsoon in winter or early spring, and back again to Arabia in late spring or early summer.

==Navigation==
For celestial navigation, dhow sailors have traditionally used the kamal, an observation device that determines latitude by finding the angle of the Pole Star above the horizon.

==Types==

* &quot;Baghlah&quot; () – from the Arabic language word for &quot;mule&quot;. A heavy ship, the traditional deep-sea dhow.
*&quot;Baqarah&quot; or () – from the Arabic word for &quot;cow&quot;. Old type of small dhow similar to the Battil.
* &quot;Barijah&quot; – small dhow.
* &quot;Battil&quot; () – featured long stems topped by large, club-shaped stem heads.
* &quot;Beden&quot; – a smaller vessel requiring a shallow draft.
* &quot;Boom&quot; () or &quot;dhangi&quot; – a large-sized dhow with a stern that is tapering in shape and a more symmetrical overall structure. The Arab boum has a very high prow, which is trimmed in the Indian version.
* &quot;Ghanjah&quot; () or &quot;kotiya&quot; – a large vessel, similar to the Baghlah, with a curved stem and a sloping, ornately carved transom.
* &quot;Jahazi&quot; or (). A fishing or trading dhow with a broad hull similar to the , common in Lamu Island and the coast of Oman. It is also used in Bahrain for the pearl industry. The word comes from &quot;jahāz&quot; (), a Persian word for &quot;ship&quot;.
* &quot;Jaliboot&quot; or &quot;jelbut&quot; (). A small to medium-sized dhow. It is the modern version of the shu&#x27;ai with a shorter prow stem piece. Most are fitted with engines.
* &quot;Patamar&quot;, a type of Indian dhow.
*&quot;Sambuk&quot; or &quot;sambuq&quot; () – the largest type of dhow seen in the Persian Gulf today. It has a characteristic keel design, with a sharp curve right below the top of the prow. It has been one of the most successful dhows in history. The word is cognate with the Greek &quot;sambúkē&quot;, ultimately from Middle Persian . 
* &quot;Shu&#x27;ai&quot; (). Medium-sized dhow. Formerly the most common dhow in the Persian Gulf used for fishing as well as for coastal trade.
* &quot;Zaruq&quot; – small dhow, slightly larger than a barijah
*Dhoni – Maldivian traditional multi-purpose sail vessel.

The term &quot;dhow&quot; is sometimes also applied to certain smaller lateen-sail rigged boats traditionally used in the Red Sea, the eastern Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf area, as well as in the Indian Ocean from Madagascar to the Bay of Bengal. These include the feluccas used in Egypt, Sudan and Iraq, and the dhoni used in the Maldives, as well as the , and . All these vessels have common elements with the dhow. On the Swahili Coast, in countries such as Kenya, the Swahili word used for dhow is &quot;jahazi&quot;.

==Museums==
The Kuwaiti Maritime Museum in Salmiya, Kuwait, holds replicas of a number of different types of dhows.

The &quot;Al-Hashemi-II&quot; (1997-2001), in Kuwait City, Kuwait, was recognized by Guinness World Record as the largest wooden dhow ever built; it has never been floated and is used for events.

<text>Conques (; Languedocien: &quot;Concas&quot;) is a former commune in the Aveyron department in Southern France, in the Occitania region. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Conques-en-Rouergue.

==Geography==
The village is located at the confluence of the rivers Dourdou de Conques and Ouche. It is built on a hillside and has classic narrow medieval streets. As a result, large vehicles such as buses cannot enter the historic town centre and must park outside. Consequently, most day visitors enter on foot. The town was largely passed by in the nineteenth century, and was saved from oblivion by the efforts of a small number of dedicated people. As a result, the historic core of the town has very little construction dating from between 1800 and 1950, leaving the medieval structures remarkably intact. The roads have been paved, and modern-day utility lines are buried. It is one of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (most beautiful villages of France).

The town is situated in a valley. Its name originates , which is derived .

==Abbey Church of Sainte-Foy==
The Abbey Church of Sainte-Foy in Conques was a popular stop for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago on their way to Santiago de Compostela in what is now Spain. The main draw for medieval pilgrims at Conques were the remains of Saint Faith (&quot;Sainte-Foy&quot;), a martyred young woman from the fourth century.

The original monastery building at Conques was an eighth-century oratory built by monks fleeing the Saracens in Spain. The original chapel was destroyed in the eleventh century in order to facilitate the creation of a much larger church as the arrival of the relics of Sainte-Foy caused the pilgrimage route to shift from Agen to Conques. The second phase of construction, which was completed by the end of the eleventh-century, included the building of the five radiating chapels, the ambulatory with a lower roof, the choir without the gallery and the nave without the galleries. The third phase of construction, which was completed early in the twelfth-century, was inspired by the churches of Toulouse and Santiago Compostela. Like most pilgrimage churches Conques is a basilica plan that has been modified into a cruciform plan. Galleries were added over the aisle and the roof was raised over the transept and choir to allow people to circulate at the gallery level. The western aisle was also added to allow for increased pilgrim traffic. The exterior length of the church is 59 meters. The interior length is 56 meters. the width of each transept is 4 meters. The height of the crossing tower is 26.40 meters tall.

The Abbey Church of Sainte-Foy was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1998, as part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France. Its Romanesque architecture, albeit somewhat updated in places, is displayed in periodic self-guided tour opportunities, especially of the upper level, some of which occur at night with live music and appropriately-adjusted light levels.

==Population==
==Media==
American author Hannah Green wrote a non-fiction work about Conques and the church entitled &quot;Little Saint&quot;, based on her visit to the town in 1975.

The massive movie set of the fictional provincial town of Villeneuve in Beauty and the Beast was inspired by the town of Conques.

<doc id="232185" wikidata="Q213482" url="?curid=232185" title="Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa">
<text>Giuseppe Tomasi, 11th Prince of Lampedusa, 12th Duke of Palma, GE (23 December 1896 – 23 July 1957), known as Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa (), was a Sicilian writer, nobleman, and Prince of Lampedusa. He is most famous for his only novel, &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; (first published posthumously in 1958), which is set in his native Sicily during the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;. A taciturn, solitary, shy, and somewhat misanthropic aristocrat, he opened up only with a few close friends, and spent a great deal of his time reading and meditating. He said of himself as a child, &quot;I was a boy who liked solitude, who preferred the company of things to that of people&quot;, and in 1954 wrote, &quot;Of my sixteen hours of daily wakefulness, at least ten are spent in solitude.&quot;

==Biography==
Tomasi was born in Palermo to Giulio Maria Tomasi, Prince of Lampedusa, Duke of Palma di Montechiaro, Baron of Torretta, and Grandee of Spain (1868–1934), and Beatrice Mastrogiovanni Tasca Filangieri di Cutò (1870–1946). He was fourth cousin once removed of jeweler Fulco di Verdura and first cousin of poet Lucio Piccolo. He became an only child after the death (from diphtheria) in 1897 of his sister Stefania. He was very close to his mother, a strong personality who influenced him a great deal, especially because his father was rather cold and detached. Although much of the paternal family fortune was lost even before his father&#x27;s time, and another large portion was tied up in lengthy litigation, they still owned the grand Palazzo Lampedusa in Palermo, which they shared with his paternal grandparents, three bachelor uncles, and a number of servants. This was the main residence of his childhood, although he spent summers and some other periods at the Palazzo Filangeri-Cutò, his mother&#x27;s family home in rural Santa Margherita di Belice.

At first, his education was a bit erratic: on his eighth birthday, he had already learned conversational French but had not yet learned to read or write even his native language. Beginning in the summer of his eighth year he studied in the two family palaces with a tutor (including the subjects of literature and English), with his mother (who taught him French) and with a grandmother who read him the novels of Emilio Salgari. The palace in Santa Marghereta had an excellent library, from which Tomasi soon read voraciously. The palace at Santa Margherita had a small theatre. For two weeks every summer a troupe of traveling players rented the theatre for a nominal fee and put on a different play every night for two weeks. Tomasi saw many performances there; years later he particularly recalled seeing his first performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot; with an audience composed largely of &quot;illiterate labourers.&quot;

In March 1911 his mother&#x27;s younger sister, Princess Julia Trigona, a lady in waiting to Queen Elena, was murdered by her lover Baron Vincenzo Paternò del Cugno. The resulting scandal led the family to spend the summer in Tuscany and the autumn in Rome. That autumn, Tomasi attended the &quot;liceo classico&quot; in Rome and then continued that curriculum at the &quot;liceo&quot; in Palermo for roughly three years. In 1914-1915 he was enrolled in the Law Faculty of the University of Genoa, though it is not clear that he actually ever attended. He definitely attended law classes in Rome in early 1915. However that year he was drafted into the army. He served first in the artillery (where he became a corporal), then transferred to the infantry. Beginning in May 1917 he underwent officer training in Turin, and was sent to the front as an officer that September. When the Italians lost the Battle of Caporetto, he was well to the west of the front lines of the main battle, but was taken prisoner by the Austro-Hungarian Army during the chaotic retreat. He was held in a PoW camp near Vienna (and was even allowed a visit to the city at one point). As the war approached its end he succeeded in escaping and returning to Italy.

After being mustered out of the army in February 1920 as a lieutenant, he returned to Sicily, where he spent several months in a state of nervous exhaustion. After a few brief attempts at resuming his formal studies, he entered a relatively peripatetic stage of his life. Finding post-War Sicily much less to his taste than pre-War Sicily, he spent time in Genoa, Turin, Tuscany, Bologna and even Munich.

While his formal education may have been erratic, Tomasi was a strong, self-driven reader, and had a great facility with languages. Besides a basic knowledge of Latin and Greek obtained in the &quot;liceo&quot;, he had mastered Italian, French, and German as a child, and English shortly thereafter. Late in life, he would add Spanish, and he also learned some Russian along the way. He read extensively in all of these languages, as well as reading Russian literature in translation. Primarily he read literature and history, though he also read books about art and architecture. His tastes were broad and his reading extensive: he had read all of Shakespeare&#x27;s works before his first visit to the UK in his twenties; he was almost certainly one of the first Italians to plunge seriously into James Joyce; and he read many minor writers, many of whom he found provided a window into particular times and milieux.

Tomasi&#x27;s uncle Pietro Tomasi Della Torretta was Italian ambassador to the UK from 1922 to 1927. Although Pietro&#x27;s own politics were liberal conservative, he was a diplomat rather than a politician and continued to serve into Italy&#x27;s Fascist era until Mussolini ultimately demanded his resignation. Tomasi made numerous long visits to London during his uncle&#x27;s tenure as ambassador, travelling a good deal within the UK and in France on the way there and back. It was also through his uncle that Tomasi would meet his future wife. Pietro was married to Alice Barbi, who was widow of a Baltic German baron, by whom she had two daughters Olga, nicknamed Lolette, and Alexandra von Wolff-Stomersee (1894–1982), nicknamed &quot;Licy&quot;.

Little is known of Tomasi&#x27;s relations with women before his marriage. He was engaged at least twice—once to an English girl, once to an Italian girl—but even the names of these fiancées are unknown, as are the names of his friends and associates in England, including a Scottish girl with whom he once described himself as &quot;infatuated.&quot;

Tomasi and Licy first met in London in 1925. He visited her at Stāmeriena Palace (Stomersee) in 1927. They met again in Rome in 1930, Stomersee in 1931, and she visited him at Easter 1932 in Palermo. Since 1918, and throughout this period, she remained married to André Pilar, an Estonian baron. Pilar was homosexual, and the terms of the marriage are unclear; Pilar, Licy, and Tomasi all remained close even after the prior couple divorced and Licy married Tomasi. (For that matter, it is not clear whether Tomasi&#x27;s marriage with Licy had a sexual component, either.)

The marriage took place in the Orthodox Annunciation of Our Most Holy Lady Church in Riga on 24 August 1932. Tomasi had kept his marriage plans entirely secret from his family and even on his wedding day sent them letters saying only that he had &quot;decided to marry&quot; Licy, not that he had done so; it took about a month for him to come clean. At the time of their marriage Licy was a student of psychoanalysis. They first lived with Tomasi&#x27;s mother in Palermo, but the incompatibility between the two women soon drove Licy back to Latvia. Through the rest of the 1930s, he lived largely in Palermo and she variously in Riga or Stomersee; typically she made an annual winter visit to Palermo and he made a summer visit to the Baltic. Licy began practising as a psychoanalyst in 1936.

In June 1934 Tomasi di Lampedusa&#x27;s father died, and he inherited his princely title. According to his widow, shortly after this he first conceived his future novel &quot;The Leopard&quot;. Originally his plan was to have the entire novel occur over the course of one day, similar to the famous modernist novel by James Joyce, &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

He was briefly called back to arms in 1940, but, as the owner of a hereditary agricultural estate, was soon sent home to take care of its affairs. He served again very briefly in January 1942, but was sent home because of periostitis in his right leg. He and his mother took refuge in Capo d&#x27;Orlando, first with his Piccolo cousins and then in a place of their own; Licy had fled the Baltic to escape the heavy fighting there, initially settling in Rome. They were reunited in Ficarra, but again his mother and Licy failed to get along; when the war ended for Italy, the couple headed for Palermo while his mother first remained in Ficarra, then went back to Capo d&#x27;Orlando.

The people closest to Tomasi all survived the war, but the Lampedusa palace in Palermo did not; it was a near-ruin from Allied bombing. Although some of Tomasi&#x27;s writing suggests that the destruction was total, they were able to salvage much of the furniture and nearly all of Tomasi&#x27;s extensive library. Enough remained of the building that Tomasi&#x27;s mother lived out the last year of her life in the remnant, dying in 1946.

In Palermo, Tomasi and Licy first rented a furnished apartment in an old, poorer quarter of Palermo. After a little less than two years, he gave up any serious hope of restoring the Palazzo Lampedusa, though the loss weighed on him till the end of his life; he then purchased the nearby house at number 28 Via Butera, a well-architected older house, even a &quot;palace,&quot; but in what was by then a slum district. In the immediate post-war years, Licy had her psychoanalytic patients, and was by this time vice president of the Italian Society of Psychoanalysts, which meant she spent a good deal of time in Rome. For about two years beginning in late 1944, Tomasi served as president of the Palermo provincial committee of the Italian Red Cross; he resigned in March 1947, unable to cope with the &quot;dark intrigues&quot; (his words) that interfered with so many projects in Sicily. On the whole, this was a dark period for Tomasi, lightened somewhat by his continuing visits to his Piccolo cousins in Capo d&#x27;Orlando, where his cousin Lucio remained his closest intellectual friend.

In 1953 he began to spend time with a group of young intellectuals, one of whom was future literary critic Francesco Orlando, and another of whom was Tomasi&#x27;s distant cousin Gioacchino Lanza, with whom he developed such a close relationship that in 1956 he legally adopted him. Their conversations soon turned into an intensive series of classes taught by Tomasi. He taught Orlando English, which Orlando appears to have picked up remarkably rapidly, and then began a series of classes on European literature. Tomasi&#x27;s notes for these classes were the most extensive piece of writing he ever did; they included a 1000-page critical history of English literature from Bede to Graham Greene, including an effort to place the various writers in their historical-political contexts. This was followed by a less formal course on French literature and some less formal studies (Goethe, Spanish literature, Sicilian history) with individual members of the group.

Tomasi travelled in 1954 with his cousin, the poet Lucio Piccolo, to San Pellegrino Terme to attend a literary conference; Piccolo had been invited on the basis of his recently published poetry and brought Tomasi as a guest. Also attending were, among others, Eugenio Montale, Emilio Cecchi, and Maria Bellonci. Upon returning from this trip he commenced writing &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; (&quot;The Leopard&quot;). In 1955 he wrote, &quot;Being mathematically certain that I was no more foolish [than Lucio], I sat down at my desk and wrote a novel.&quot;

By June 1955 he had completed a version of the first chapter, conforming to his original intent of a story set in a single 24-hour period in 1860. He then digressed to write the first chapter of a projected autobiography; this chapter was published posthumously as &quot;The Places of My Early Childhood.&quot; He then returned to writing the novel. Initially, few people around him were aware of any of this: the large amounts of time he spent alone were now spent at his writing desk. He did finally show the work in progress to most of his close associates in early 1956. For the brief remainder of his life he would alternate between expanding and revising the novel and working on various shorter works.

During his life, the novel was rejected by the two publishers to whom Tomasi submitted it. The published novel would eventually have eight chapters; in May 1956, he sent a four-chapter typescript to Mondadori in Milan. That summer he wrote two more chapters and in October he sent these to Mondadori as well. Mondadori rejected the novel in December 1956, although their rejection left open the possibility of considering a future version of the same work. In early 1957 he wrote two more chapters, revised those he had already written, and sent typescripts to several people. With Tomasi&#x27;s permission, Francesco Orlando sent a copy to literary agent , daughter of Benedetto Croce, leaving the author anonymous. Another recipient, bookseller and publisher Fausto Flaccovio, liked the book but was not in the business of publishing fiction; he suggested sending it to Elio Vittorini, unsurprisingly this rather traditional novel did not appeal to modernist Vittorini, who found it &quot;rather old-fashioned&quot; and &quot;essayish&quot;.

Eventually, the copy sent to Croce bore fruit, but not in Tomasi&#x27;s lifetime. In 1957 Tomasi di Lampedusa was diagnosed with lung cancer; he died on 23 July in Rome. Following a requiem in the Basilica del Sacro Cuore di Gesù in Rome, he was buried three days later in the Capuchin cemetery of Palermo.

His novel was published the year after his death. had sent it to the writer Giorgio Bassani, who brought it to the publisher Feltrinelli. On 3 March 1958, the publisher Feltrinelli contacted Licy to make arrangements to publish the novel. &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; was quickly recognized as a great work of Italian literature. It was published in November 1958, and became a bestseller, going through 52 editions in less than six months. In 1959 Tomasi di Lampedusa was posthumously awarded the prestigious Strega Prize for the novel.

==Works==
Tomasi did little public writing before the last few years of his life. He maintained a commonplace book (mostly in French, but also with passages in English and Italian; this appears to have been compiled mainly in the 1920s) and a laconic diary in which he often noted where he visited, what films he saw, etc.; in 1926-1927 he published three articles of literary criticism in &quot;Le Opere e i Giorni&quot;, a little magazine associated with Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio and Luigi Pirandello. He also wrote, but made no attempt to publish, several other short pieces about literature. He took photographs when he travelled, but none of them rose above the level of tourist snapshots.

In the mid-1950s he wrote extensive notes (not originally intended for publication) on European literature, including a 1000-page critical history of English literature from Bede to Graham Greene.

His novel &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; (&quot;The Leopard&quot;) follows the family of its title character, the Sicilian nobleman Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, through the events of the Risorgimento. Perhaps the most memorable line in the book is spoken by Don Fabrizio&#x27;s nephew, Tancredi, urging unsuccessfully that Don Fabrizio abandon his allegiance to the disintegrating Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and ally himself with Giuseppe Garibaldi and the House of Savoy: &quot;Unless we ourselves take a hand now, they&#x27;ll foist a republic on us. If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change&quot;, an approach to politics that has become known as the di Lampedusa strategy. The point-of-view character, Don Fabrizio, explicitly rejects this view, and despite the name &quot;di Lampedusa strategy&quot; there is little reason to think the author himself endorsed it.

The title is rendered in English as &quot;The Leopard&quot;, but the Italian word &quot;gattopardo&quot; refers to the African serval, native not far from Lampedusa, in Northern Africa. &quot;Il gattopardo&quot; may be a reference to a wildcat that was hunted to extinction in Italy in the mid-19th century – just as Don Fabrizio was dryly contemplating the indolence and decline of the Sicilian aristocracy.

In 1963 &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; was made into a film, directed by Luchino Visconti and starring Burt Lancaster, Alain Delon, and Claudia Cardinale; it won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

Tomasi also wrote some lesser-known works: &quot;I racconti&quot; (&quot;Stories&quot;, first published 1961), including the novella &quot;The Professor and the Siren&quot;, and the first chapter of an unfinished novel, &quot;I gatinni ciechi&quot; (&quot;The Blind Kittens&quot;); &quot;Le lezioni su Stendhal&quot; (&quot;Lessons on Stendhal&quot;, privately published in 1959, published in book form in 1977); and &quot;Invito alle lettere francesi del Cinquecento&quot; (&quot;Introduction to sixteenth-century French literature&quot;, first published 1970). In 2010, a collection of his letters were published in English as &quot;Letters from London and Europe&quot;. His perceptive commentaries on English and other foreign literatures make up a greater part of his works by volume than does his fiction.

== Views on politics and literature ==
Tomasi&#x27;s political views are not easily pigeonholed. He was a self-declared monarchist who declined the Monarchist National Party&#x27;s request that he offer his candidacy in 1948 for the Italian Senate and actively chose not to join that party; he was generally critical of both the Bourbon monarchs who had ruled the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and their successors, the Savoyard monarchs who ruled the Kingdom of Italy. His dissent from the typical views one would expect of a monarchist was even more dramatic in some matters not affecting Sicily: he preferred Oliver Cromwell to Charles II and the Jacobins to Louis XVI, of whom he wrote that no one in history had more deserved to have his head cut off.

Tomasi despised Sicilian liberals as corrupt and ineffective (though he had at least a grudging admiration for British liberals) and initially admired the Italian fascists, though he never particularly threw in his lot with them and was away from Italy more during the fascist era than at any other time. In the 1950s, he referred to one of Mussolini&#x27;s works as an &quot;encyclopaedia of ignorance and conceit.&quot; He was sympathetic to the Jansenists and to English Catholics such as Graham Greene, one of his favorite contemporary writers, but also to the English Puritans; the poet John Milton was another of his favorites.

As remarked above, when Tancredi in &quot;The Leopard&quot; says, “If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change,” there is no reason to believe that he is speaking for the author. Tomasi&#x27;s pessimism about Sicily, and his regret over what he sees as his homeland&#x27;s corruption and &quot;irredeemability&quot; is tempered by a sense of its grandeur. As for the causes of Sicilian &quot;irredeemability,&quot; the novel spreads the blame widely. The Savoyard Piedmontese are presented as naive about the South, full of plans that will never match the reality of the region, while the book&#x27;s main representative of the old Bourbon regime, Don Fabrizio&#x27;s brother-in-law Màlvica, is a fool. In his biography of Tomasi, David Gilmour sees Tomasi as criticising the Risorgimento (Unification of Italy) &quot;from both sides, from the viewpoints of both Gramsci…,&quot; describing the failure of the revolutionaries to truly ally with the peasants, &quot;…and the Bourbons,&quot; describing a unified Italy&#x27;s substitution of even worse elements into the island&#x27;s elite.

Upon publication of &quot;The Leopard&quot;, Elio Vittorini (who had rejected an earlier draft of the book for his own press), Alberto Moravia, and Franco Fortini, among others, condemned the book as &quot;right-wing;&quot; in Moravia&#x27;s words, it expressed ruling-class &quot;ideas and view of life.&quot; The equally leftist Louis Aragon vehemently disagreed, seeing it as a &quot;merciless&quot; criticism of that class; many among the surviving Sicilian nobility certainly saw it as such, and were scandalized that one of their own could write such a thing.

Tomasi read broadly in English, French, German, Italian, and later Spanish and (to a lesser extent) Russian. He owned 1,100 books on French history, including keeping up to date on the then-current work of Fernand Braudel and the &quot;Annales&quot; school. Similarly, his reading in Italian history continued through Federico Chabod and Adolfo Omodeo. He listened to a fair amount of music, both in live performance and recordings, but never had anything like the interest in music he had for the written word or theatre, and often criticized how Italian operas that were adapted from plays &quot;deformed&quot; the works by oversimplification. Not that he demanded that all literature be deep and difficult. Although his course on English literature included James Joyce and T.S. Eliot, it also covered thrillers (which he traced back to the lesser Elizabethan tragedies) and detective novels (he considered Arthur Conan Doyle and G. K. Chesterton to be the best writers of the latter genre) and he was a regular filmgoer: even while writing &quot;The Leopard&quot; he went to the cinema two or three times a week; one of the films he particularly liked during that period was the Disney-produced &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;.

As a reader, in maturity Tomasi came to prefer (in Gilmour&#x27;s words) &quot;the implicit over the explicit,&quot; though he acknowledged that his own novel, &quot;The Leopard&quot;, fell more into the latter category. He liked English humour (including the use of humour in otherwise serious works), especially self-deprecating humour and understatement, and saw Samuel Johnson as the epitome of Englishness. He generally rejected elaborate critical apparatus and theory, but was very interested in comparing and contrasting writers, or looking into why particular works were more appreciated in one time or place than another, or how writers in different eras had handled the same themes. And he was not afraid to make judgements. Much though he loved Shakespeare, he found roughly eighty of his sonnets quite weak (and some of those absolutely &quot;worthless&quot;); at the other extreme he found forty of them &quot;among the finest things in world literature.&quot; He considered Charles Dickens &quot;a demi-God&quot; but still confessed to being exasperated by his sentimentalism.

In French literature he saw Montaigne as a figure comparable to Shakespeare for his ideas, even if expressed very differently: perceptive, compassionate, sceptical, irreligious but understanding of others&#x27; religious feelings, persistent in &quot;dismantling the human psyche.&quot; He considered the fact that Montaigne&#x27;s writings had been roundly disliked by Napoleon, Hitler, and Mussolini to be entirely in Montaigne&#x27;s favour (although he conjectured that the latter two hadn&#x27;t actually bothered to read him). He also loved Stendhal and agreed with André Gide that two of Stendhal&#x27;s works—&quot;The Red and the Black&quot; and &quot;The Charterhouse of Parma&quot;—were the two strongest contenders for being the best novel in any language; he was especially impressed by how concise Stendhal could be.

In poetry, he favoured John Keats and Giacomo Leopardi. Despite his admiration for Leopardi, he saw Italy in general as anti-literary, wanting from a book either that it be &quot;exciting and thoughtless&quot; or so boring that its purchase constituted a performative sacrifice. He lamented the lack of humour in most Italian literature, and felt that many Italian writers were either narrow and provincial or wrote about places and things they knew only superficially.

==Legacy==

The main-belt asteroid 14846 Lampedusa is named after him.

In 2019 Canadian novelist Steven Price published a novelized biography of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa entitled &quot;Lampedusa&quot;.

== Titles ==
His full title was:

&quot;Don&quot; Giuseppe Tomasi, 11th Prince of Lampedusa, 12th Duke of Palma, Baron of Montechiaro, Baron of La Torretta, and Grandee of Spain of the first class

<text>The M40 motorway links London, Oxford, and Birmingham in England, a distance of approximately .

The motorway is dual three lanes except for junction 1A to junction 3 (which is dual four lanes) a short section in-between the exit and entry slip-roads at junction 4 (which is two lanes in both directions) and also between the slip-roads at junction 9 (in the south-eastbound direction only).

An Active Traffic Management system operates on the short section north-westbound from junction 16 (A3400) to the M42.

== History ==
=== London to Great Milton ===
The motorway between London and Oxford was constructed in stages between 1967 and 1974. The first section opened in June 1967, from Handy Cross roundabout, High Wycombe to Stokenchurch (junctions 4–5). In 1969, extending in a southerly direction to Holtspur, Beaconsfield, a temporary junction 2 was opened. The section bypassing Beaconsfield was built in 1971 and the section past Gerrards Cross to junction 1 was completed in 1973. In 1974, the motorway between junctions 5 to 8 was completed to Great Milton.

Between junctions 3 and 4, the beginnings of slip roads were built on both carriageways for a service area at Abbey Barns between Beaconsfield and High Wycombe. Beaconsfield services off junction 2 opened in 2009.

=== Great Milton to Birmingham ===
Late in the 1960s, not long after the first stretch opened, the Ministry of Transport announced the possibility of building a new motorway to link London with Birmingham as an alternative to the M1M6 routeas well as improving road links to the South Coast ports for The Midlands but it was not until 1983 that the decision to extend the M40 from Oxford to the south of Birmingham was made.

The preferred route was altered to avoid Otmoor after a vigorous road protest, which included selling over 3,000 small squares of a field to people all over the world. The field had been renamed &#x27;Alice&#x27;s field&#x27; as a reference to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; by Lewis Carroll who lived in the area at the time of the book&#x27;s writing.

Construction began at Warwick in October 1987, with work on the section around Banbury starting in February 1988, and finally, the section north of Oxford in July 1989. The section between the M42 and Warwick opened in December 1989, and the remainder in January 1991.

At the time of being fully opened, the original M40 had been widened, creating a dual three-lane motorway from start to finish, with the exception of the Handy Cross underpass, which remains dual two-lane.

=== Further developments ===

The M40 had been expected to be the last major motorway to be built in Britain, but in 1986 the Conservative government announced a major new road-building scheme, Roads for Prosperity, much of which was cancelled in 1996 after major road protests.

Beginning in 1997, the motorway was widened to dual-four-lane between J1A and J3 (High Wycombe East) under a Private Finance Initiative. It was completed by a Carillion-John Laing joint venture in October 1998 – the original plan included widening between J3 and J4. Oxford services and Warwick Services opened in 1998.

Work to separate local and long-distance traffic at J4 was completed in 2007, including a new dedicated left-turn slip lane between the A404 Marlow Bypass and the Oxford-bound M40; additional lanes on the slip roads entering the roundabout; an additional lane between the A404 Marlow Hill and the London-bound M40; and a five-lane cross-link between the M40 and the A404(S).

In 2009 the Highways Agency extended the Active Traffic Management (ATM) system onto the northbound carriageway from J16 to the junction with the M42. Beaconsfield services opened in 2009, near the site of the service station proposed at Abbey Barns almost 40 years earlier.

In August 2010 work started on J9, upgrading the southbound exit slip road to three lanes, and similar widening on the connecting A34 and A41 junctions between Oxford and Bicester. This was the first part of the work at this busy junction since it was built 20 years earlier. If the necessary funding becomes available, a second phase of improvement will be carried out, upgrading the northbound entrance and the A41 southbound entrance.

=== Main towns/cities served ===
The following table only includes places situated near the motorway and those close enough to be considered &#x27;near the motorway&#x27; (like Aylesbury). Other places that may use the motorway (for access to the north) are not included as they have other motorway access (for example Slough). Small villages are not included. Population figures are based on the 2001 census by the Office for National Statistics
=== List of junctions ===

Data from driver location signs are used to provide distance and carriageway identifier information. Where a junction spans several hundred metres, both start and end locations are given.

An Active Traffic Management system operates on the short section northbound from junction 16 (A3400) to the M42.

=== Services ===
The motorway has four service areas:
* Beaconsfield services (off J2), operated by Extra MSA accessible from the A355
* Oxford services (off J8A), operated by Welcome Break, accessible from J8 and the A418
* Cherwell Valley services (off J10, A43), operated by Moto. The first service station, opened in 1994 on the site of temporary toilet areas created when the motorway was constructed.
* Warwick services (between J12 and J13), operated by Welcome Break, consisting of two sites mirroring each other without a connection.

=== Detailed route description ===
Junction 1 of the M40 is at the Denham Roundabout near Uxbridge just east of the M25. The motorway is carried over the top of the roundabout, which interchanges with the A40, the A412, the A4020 and links to the A413 off the A40 westbound.

The motorway carries on for another before it reaches junction 1a, the free-flow interchange with the M25 London Orbital. It is a partially unrolled cloverleaf, with the smoothest turns from the London-bound M40 (from Oxfordshire, Warwickshire and the wider West Midlands) to the anti-clockwise M25 (London Heathrow, Gatwick, The Channel Ports) and vice versa, since this is the largest exchange of traffic between the two motorways. The M40 passes over the interchange, with the M25 on the bottom. The clockwise M25 enters the junction with four lanes with a lane drop to accommodate traffic heading for the M40 westbound, leaving the junction with three lanes. The anti-clockwise M25 enters the junction with three lanes and gains a lane from the London-bound M40 to accommodate the extra traffic.
The London-bound M40 enters with four lanes, with a lane drop for the M25 exit, leaves with three lanes, and the westbound M40 enters with lanes and gains a lane from the anti-clockwise M25.

After junction 1a the motorway is four lanes, and carries on for until it reaches junction 2 for the A355 to Slough and the A40 to Beaconsfield and Gerrards Cross. Junction 2 is the standard roundabout interchange over the M40. Beaconsfield services are located at this junction.

Junction 3 is further on, and serves the A40 for High Wycombe East and Loudwater. This is a restricted junction; the only flows are from the westbound M40 to the A40 and from the A40 to the London-bound M40. The westbound carriageway loses a lane, remaining three lanes for the rest of the route, and the London-bound carriageway gains a lane. The motorway then immediately crosses the valley on a large ramp-like bridge.

Junction 4 is the interchange with the A404, for High Wycombe, Marlow, Maidenhead, Reading, Windsor and the M4. The motorway through the junction was not widened from the original two lanes when the rest of the motorway from junction 8 to London was, and so both carriageways experience a temporary lane drop. The junction used to be a straightforward roundabout interchange with exits for the M40 (west and east), High Wycombe (A404), the A4010, two local roads and the A404 dual carriageway to the south. During 2007, work was completed which included extra stacking space on the sliproads from the M40, provision for traffic from the A404 northbound to join the M40 westbound slip road without joining the roundabout and provision for the London-bound M40 to skip the section of the roundabout which serves the A4010, High Wycombe, and the A404 north.
Junction 5 is for the A40 and Stokenchurch, a basic diamond interchange and the fourth junction of the M40 with the A40. Within a mile there is a large road cutting known as the Stokenchurch Gap or The Canyon where the motorway enters Oxfordshire and meets junction 6 with the B4009 for Lewknor, Watlington, and Chinnor. This junction is a variant on the diamond interchange, with the slip roads from the M40 having sharp bends.

Just over after junction 6 the motorway passes to within of St Giles Church, Tetsworth and farther on meets the first of three junctions in close succession. Junction 7 is a restricted junction with the A329 serving Thame and the A40. Access is limited allowing exit for only northbound traffic and entry only for southbound traffic. The exiting slip road on the southbound M40 at junction 7 is for &quot;Works Traffic Only&quot; to a depot. A slip road allows traffic from the A329 to join the M40 north but is closed to motorway traffic by a gate, so traffic must continue for to junction 8.

At junction 8, a spur off the M40, with two-lane carriageways, leaves the mainline of the motorway as far as a trumpet junction for Wheatley and the A418, then continuing as the A40 towards Oxford. The spur can be accessed via the M40 northbound or by leaving the M40 at junction 8a southbound and crossing the M40 via the A418, and traffic heading towards the M40 can only join the southbound carriageway. Traffic going in the other direction has to use the trumpet junction, and follow the A418 past Oxford services. The M40 heads north from junction 8A. This was the temporary end of the M40 before the northern section was open. Visible either side of the junction are the embankments and remains of the overbridge which carried the Wycombe railway line.

The motorway continues for to junction 9 for the A34 (E05) and the A41. The A34 dual carriageway serves Oxford and is a trunk route for Newbury, Winchester and Southampton (via the M3) as well as the rest of the South Coast — for this the reason it is part of the unsigned European route E05. The A41 dual carriageway serves Bicester and Aylesbury, and both roads meet the motorway at Wendelbury roundabout junction. Its design is inefficient and cannot cope with a very large volume of traffic using the junction. To try to alleviate this problem, there is a temporary lane drop for the London-bound carriageway. The largest exchange of traffic is between the A34 and the M40 north, and traffic on those roads backs up and causes congestion on both roads (going north and south), as well as on the interchange itself. North of the junction, the existing A34 becomes the A3400. This means the A34 is now technically in two halves (it regains status farther up the road at junction 16, although signs on the motorway do not mention this). Instead, the first signs for the A34 from a motorway are on the M42 at junction 4, as with the A41. The road also becomes part of the E05 north of junction 9.

The M40 follows a course of almost due north for before reaching junction 10, for the Cherwell Valley services, the A43 and the village of Ardley. The A43 terminates at junction 10, although originally it carried on to Kidlington, the southern part of the old route now used by the re-routed A34. (The original A43 towards Oxford is now the B430.) The A43 serves Brackley, Silverstone and its racing circuit, home to the British Grand Prix. Farther on, the A43 leads to Northampton and the M1. Junction 10 was originally a dumbbell junction. The capacity of both the junction and the single carriageway A43 proved too small when the road was used as a freight thoroughfare from the congested M1 to the M40 to London, and the A34 at junction 9 to the south coast — in fact the stretch between these junctions is the busiest on the motorway in both directions. When the A43 (between the M1 and M40) was upgraded to dual carriageway, the junction was redesigned and rebuilt by the Highways Agency to cope with the extra traffic. A third roundabout was added to the junction, to the north, with the slips for the southbound M40 and the A43, with the slip roads for the northbound M40 remodelled as well, and the roundabout in the middle now serving the services.
The slip road for the London-bound carriageway which used to be accessed from the roundabout is now reached only via the services. The design and execution of the revised design of new junction is greatly derided, mostly because of the three roundabouts giving no priority to the main flow of traffic, (A43-M40 London), and the slip roads off and onto the motorway (except the one accessed via the services) have sharp turns and adverse cambers, which results in lorries frequently tipping over and spilling their loads especially on the roundabout at the end of the northern carriageway. The junction fails to perform its function as an effective traffic junction. As well, the slip roads onto the motorway give little manoeuvring space as both join the motorway under (the same) bridge built for the old junction.

The motorway then follows a winding route north for until junction 11, the A422 and A361, serving Banbury. The motorway does not follow the straight route to the east of Middleton Cheney, meeting with the A422, as it had once been planned, due to a major landowner refusing his land to be cut in two. If built as planned, junction 11 would be east of Middleton Cheney, meeting with the A422, and probably would have fuelled major growth in the village as well as Banbury, the primary destination of the junction. As it is, the junction was built west along the A422, with the motorway skirting Banbury. The junction itself is a regular roundabout interchange, and has the single carriageway A361 from Daventry the dual-carriageway A422 from Brackley and the A43 from the west, and the dual-carriageway A422 (A361) toward Banbury feeding to/from it.

Another north-west along the motorway is junction 12, serving Gaydon and the Heritage Motor Centre via the B4451. The junction is a box-standard diamond interchange. Farther along the motorway is Warwick Services, the last on the motorway, before it reaches the restricted access junction 13. This serves Leamington Spa and Warwick via the A452, and Gaydon via the B4100. The junction is incomplete as a half-diamond interchange, with access only from the northbound carriageway and access to the southbound M40.

The junction is completed farther on at junction 14, another restricted access junction, with access to the A452 from the southbound M40, and the access on to the motorway is in a northbound direction. The slip roads join at a roundabout and carry on as the single carriageway A452 to meet with the A452 to Leamington Spa, A425 to Warwick, and the A452 to J13. A few hundred yards further up is junction 15, known as Longbridge island. This is a large, regular roundabout interchange, and is always busy during peak times due to the various destinations it serves, including The Cotswolds, Stratford-upon-Avon, Coventry, and Warwick. Farther north, Henley-in-Arden (J16) is again &#x27;incomplete&#x27; to discourage local traffic.

The motorway joins the M42 in both directions, with northbound traffic taking the left lane to exit eastbound, eventually forming the outer lanes of the M42 via a tight-bending two lane connecting road, and the right lanes being taken eastbound. Similarly, southbound, eastbound traffic from the M42 splits off from the outer two lanes, whereas westbound traffic of the M42 has a single lane, widening to a two lane slip road, which merges with the middle lane and forms the outer lane of the southbound M40.

== Incidents and accidents ==

* 18 November 1993, 12 school children and a teacher died when their minibus crashed into a parked motorway maintenance vehicle just after midnight. The inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death for all of the victims but noted that none of the children were wearing seatbelts and that the side-facing bench seating was dangerous. Seatbelts were subsequently made compulsory equipment on all coaches and minibuses, more than 20 years after they had been compulsory on cars.

<text>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto&#x27;s pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: &quot;Karakuri&quot; (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha&#x27;s monthly &quot;Hop Step Award&quot; the following year, and &quot;Naruto&quot; (1997).

&quot;Naruto&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from September 1999 to November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North American production and serialized &quot;Naruto&quot; in their digital &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; magazine. The manga adapted into two anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran from October 2002 to March 2017 on TV Tokyo. Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations (OVAs). The franchise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies. The story of &quot;Naruto&quot; continues in &quot;Boruto&quot;, where Naruto&#x27;s son Boruto Uzumaki creates his own ninja way instead of following his father&#x27;s.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

&quot;Naruto&quot; is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having million copies in circulation worldwide. It has become one of Viz Media&#x27;s best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga&#x27;s character development, storylines, and action sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

== Plot ==
=== Part I ===
A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him a host of the beast. The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha&#x27;s villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him. Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.

Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced &quot;sensei&quot;, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.

After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.

During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan. After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi, who had showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade&#x27;s apprentice.

=== Part II ===
Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the nine Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha&#x27;s superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village&#x27;s respect and admiration.

With Nagato&#x27;s death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha&#x27;s founding fathers), announces that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront his faction and allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki&#x27;s forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.

During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi&#x27;s who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved Obito&#x27;s life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan&#x27;s downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito&#x27;s plans.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
In 1995, Shueisha released &quot;Karakuri&quot;, a one-shot manga by Masashi Kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the Hop Step Award in 1996. Kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow-up, and decided to work on another project. The new project was originally going to feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of &quot;Naruto&quot; for the summer 1997 issue of &quot;Akamaru Jump&quot; based on the idea. Despite the positive feedback it received in a readers&#x27; poll, Kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story, so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas.

The first eight chapters of &quot;Naruto&quot; were planned before it appeared in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the Konoha village. By the time &quot;Naruto&quot; debuted, the background art was sparse, instead emphasizing the characters. Though Kishimoto had concerns that chakra (the energy source used by the ninjas in &quot;Naruto&quot;) made the series too Japanese, he still believed it is an enjoyable read. Kishimoto is a fan of Godzilla, and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because Kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters. He has said that the central theme in Part I of &quot;Naruto&quot; is how people accept each other, citing Naruto&#x27;s development across the series as an example.

For Part II of the manga, Kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow, and avoid &quot;overdo[ing] the typical manga-style&quot;. He considers that his drawing style has changed from &quot;the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic.&quot; Because of wishing to end the arc involving Sasuke Uchiha&#x27;s search for his brother, Itachi, in a single volume, Kishimoto decided that volume 43 should include more chapters than regular volumes. As a result, Kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume 43 was more expensive than regular volumes.

=== Characters ===
When he created &quot;Naruto&quot;, Kishimoto looked to other manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while basing the story on Japanese culture. The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another. He found it difficult to write about romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning with volume 28. He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters&#x27; moral values and clearly illustrate their differences. As a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the ellipsis in order to have them age and become stronger during this time.

=== Setting ===
Kishimoto made use of the Chinese zodiac tradition, which had a long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from this. When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha. The idea of the setting came to him &quot;pretty spontaneously without much thought&quot;, but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama. Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores. He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot.

=== Conclusion ===
Masashi Kishimoto&#x27;s home was close to Hiroshima where his grandfather lived. He would often tell his grandson stories of war and how it was related to grudges. However, Kishimoto commented that someone cannot look at the current state and criticize war as &quot;being simply wrong&quot;, adding that every little thing in history causes the build-up towards war, and when it reaches its limit, &quot;it breaks out.&quot; For that reason, Kishimoto felt that war would not be believable in his manga unless he had carefully elaborated on its background. Upon further researching, Kishimoto decided to create a world war story arc for the manga&#x27;s finale. However, unlike the stories he heard from his grandfather, Kishimoto wanted to give the war covered in &quot;Naruto&quot; a more hopeful feeling. Nagato&#x27;s arc paved the way for the ending of &quot;Naruto&quot; to occur. Nagato stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing Naruto&#x27;s mentor Jiraiya. Understanding the fears of war, Naruto&#x27;s characterization was made more complex for him to experience the Fourth Great Shinobi War. These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato in the final battle.

Due to unknown issues, the series&#x27; finale was delayed. Once volume 66 was released, Kishimoto commented he reached a moment from the narrative involving something he always wanted to draw. When serialization began, Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters: Naruto and Sasuke. However, the writer felt the two were not equals as the former was not a victim of war like the latter whose family was killed to stop a possible civil war.

Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto&#x27;s romantic partner from the early stages of the manga, since Hinata had always respected and admired Naruto even before the series&#x27; beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of expanding romantic plotlines. but decided to leave Naruto&#x27;s maturation through romance as an idea for the film 2014 &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; where he worked alongside screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka, a writer more skilled at the theme of romance. Similarly, the title character&#x27;s relationship with his first son, Boruto, was explored furthermore in the 2015 film &quot;&quot; to end Naruto&#x27;s growth as the character had become an adult, but it was briefly shown in the manga&#x27;s finale.

=== Manga ===
Written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto, &quot;Naruto&quot; was serialized for a 15-year run in Shueisha&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from September 21, 1999, to November 10, 2014. Shueisha collected its chapters in 72 volumes—27 for Part I, and the rest for Part II; they were released between March 3, 2000, and February 4, 2015.

The remaining chapters (245 to 700) belong to Part II, which continues the story after a -year gap in the internal timeline. Shueisha have also released several ani-manga , each based on one of the &quot;Naruto&quot; movies, and has released the series in Japanese for cell-phone download on their website &quot;Shueisha Manga Capsule&quot;.

&quot;Naruto&quot; was scanlated (translated by fans) and available online before a licensed version was released in North America; the rights were acquired by Viz Media, which began serializing &quot;Naruto&quot; in their anthology comic magazine &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;, starting with the January 2003 issue. The schedule was accelerated at the end of 2007 to catch up with the Japanese version, and again in early 2009, with 11 volumes (from 34 to 44) appearing in three months, after which it returned to a quarterly schedule. All 27 volumes of Part I were released in a boxed set on November 13, 2007. On May 3, 2011, Viz started selling the manga in an omnibus format with each book containing three volumes.

The franchise has been licensed in 90 countries, and the manga serialized in 35 countries. Madman Entertainment began publishing &quot;Naruto&quot; volumes in Australia and New Zealand in March 2008 after reaching a distribution deal with Viz Media.

Ikemoto was Kishimoto&#x27;s chief assistant during the run of the original &quot;Naruto&quot; series, and Kodachi was his writing partner for the &quot;&quot; film screenplay. The monthly series was preceded by a one-shot, titled , written and illustrated by Kishimoto, and published on April 25 of that same year.

However, Kishimoto refused the offer and offered his former assistant Mikio Ikemoto and writer Ukyō Kodachi write &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot; as the sequel to &quot;Naruto&quot;.

Another one-shot chapter by Kishimoto, titled , centered on Naruto&#x27;s father, Minato Namikaze, was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on July 18, 2023.

In July 2015, Lionsgate announced the development of a live-action film with Avi Arad through his production company Arad Productions. The film will be directed by Michael Gracey. On December 17, 2016, Kishimoto announced that he has been asked to co-develop. On November 27, 2023, it was announced that Tasha Huo will work on the script for the film.

On February 23, 2024, Gracey had exited the project, and Destin Daniel Cretton had been hired to direct and co-write the film.

=== Video games ===
&quot;Naruto&quot; video games have been released on various consoles by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. The majority of them are fighting games in which the player directly controls one of the characters from &quot;Naruto&quot;. The player pits their character against another character controlled by the game&#x27;s AI or by another player; the objective is to reduce the opponent&#x27;s health to zero using basic attacks as well as special techniques unique to each character derived from techniques they use in the &quot;Naruto&quot; anime or manga. The first &quot;Naruto&quot; video game was &quot;Naruto: Konoha Ninpōchō&quot;, which was released in Japan on March 27, 2003, for the WonderSwan Color.

== Reception ==
=== Sales ===
The manga has 250 million copies in circulation worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history. More than half of the total circulation were in Japan, with the remaining circulation from 46 countries and regions. It has become one of North American publisher Viz Media&#x27;s best-selling manga series; their translation of the series appeared on &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller lists several times. It was included in the fiction section of &quot;Teacher Librarian&quot;&#x27;s recommended list for 2008, and &quot;School Library Journal&quot; described it as an essential manga for school libraries. Volume 28 of the manga reached seventeenth place in the &quot;USA Today Booklist&quot; in its first week of release in March 2008, only two places short of the record for a manga, held by &quot;Fruits Basket&quot;. The volume had one of the biggest debut weeks of any manga in years, becoming the top-selling manga volume of 2008 and the second best-selling book in North America. In 2010, Viz, the publisher, commented on the loyalty of readers, who reliably continued to buy the manga as the volume count went over 40.

=== Critical response ===
Several reviewers commented on the balance between fight scenes and plot development; A. E. Sparrow of &quot;IGN&quot; and Casey Brienza of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; felt that the result was a strong storyline, but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for the same website, suggested that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot. Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimoto&#x27;s skill in depicting action. Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as &quot;dramatic, exciting, and just right for the story he&#x27;s telling&quot;. Briana Lawrence from &quot;Mania Entertainment&quot; describes the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel. Writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, Ramsey Isler called &quot;Jutsu&quot; one of the most entertaining concepts in &quot;Naruto&quot;, stating as well that their diversity, complex signs required for techniques, the unique physical features, and the sheer destructive power of &quot;Ninjutsu&quot; are the elements that have made the series widely popular.

In a review of volume 28 Brienza also praised Part II&#x27;s storyline and characterization, though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality. The fights across the Part II received praise, most notably Naruto&#x27;s and Sasuke&#x27;s, resulting in major changes into their character arcs. Meanwhile, the final battle between the two characters in the finale earned major praise for the choreography and art provided as well as how in depth the two&#x27;s personalities were shown in the aftermath. Some writers criticized Kaguya being the least entertaining villain, making the showdown between Naruto and Sasuke more appealing as a result. The finale earned nearly perfect scores from both &quot;Anime News Network&quot; and &quot;Comic Book Bin&quot;, with the latter acclaiming the popularity of the title character.

Responding to &quot;Naruto&quot; success, Kishimoto said in &quot;Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008&quot; that he was &quot;very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja. It shows that the American audience has good taste [...] because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them.&quot; Gō Itō, a professor in the manga department of Tokyo Polytechnic University, compared the series&#x27; development to the manga of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, saying that both manga present good illustrations of three-dimensional body movements that capture the characters&#x27; martial arts very well. Gō felt readers could empathize with the characters in &quot;Naruto&quot; via their inner monologue during battles. The series also influenced the movie &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. The World&quot; with director Edgar Wright saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a &quot;killer move&quot; in the manga, there is an impact in the background following any technique&#x27;s usage.

When the manga ended, multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimoto&#x27;s work. The fight scenes in general earned acclaim for how well written they are, something game developer CyberConnect2 took into account when developing the &quot;Naruto&quot; games. Christel Hoolans, managing director director of Kana and Le Lombard, called &quot;Naruto&quot; the first long-running series after &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; to become a classic in France.

=== Awards and accolades ===
&quot;Naruto&quot; won the Quill Award for graphic novel in 2006. In April 2007, volume 14 earned Viz the Manga Trade Paperback of the Year Gem Award from Diamond Comic Distributors. The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;″s 2009 Comics Awards. It won the 16th Spanish Manga Barcelona award for the shonen category in 2010. In 2015, the manga was nominated for the 19th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. Masashi Kishimoto was the winner of Rookie of the Year for the series in the Japanese government&#x27;s Agency for Cultural Affairs 2014 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Fine Arts Recommendation Awards. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Naruto&quot; ranked seventh.

=== Themes ===
Amy Plumb argues that Kishimoto&#x27;s use of references to Japanese mythology in &quot;Naruto&quot; is intended to add further layers to the story. Kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references, which allows him to avoid direct explanations. One example is Itachi, who has three ninja techniques named after Shinto deities: Tsukiyomi, Amaterasu, and Susano-o. Plumb also cites Sasuke&#x27;s clan&#x27;s heraldic symbol, a fan known as an . These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to &quot;blow away&quot; the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox on Naruto. Foxes () are tricksters in Japanese mythology, and in some stories, they take over human bodies; Plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the Nine-Tail sealed in Naruto, and the pranks Naruto plays.

Christopher A. Born notes that the &quot;Naruto&quot; storyline contains traditional Confucian values, and suggests that students who analyse manga such as &quot;Naruto&quot; and &quot;Bleach&quot; will learn more about Confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas. Norman Melchor Robles Jr. evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in &quot;Naruto&quot; by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values; he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent, but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence. Sheuo Hui Gan considers the series to have a set of &quot;traditional ethical values&quot;. She also compares the treatment of in &quot;Naruto&quot;, which Naruto overcomes by joining his society, to the portrayal of alienation in &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, where the main characters remain alienated.

&quot;Naruto&quot; has been described by several critics as a coming-of-age story. Psychologist Lawrence C. Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones, or are having difficulty finding friends, or who are in other situations shown in the series. In Yukari Fujimoto&#x27;s view, as the characters mature, they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them, making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as &quot;One Piece&quot; and &quot;Air Gear&quot;. Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists&#x27; approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: &quot;Naruto&#x27;s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge&quot;. Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in, but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager, particularly once Part II begins. &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; began to carry comedies such as &quot;Gintama&quot; and &quot;Reborn!&quot; from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki&#x27;s view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis: &quot;Naruto&quot; &quot;was not supposed to provide laughter anymore&quot;.

Fujimoto argues that the story has overly traditional gender roles, noting &quot;[...] its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation&quot;. For example, the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy, but &quot;once the boys get serious, the girls cannot keep pace&quot;. Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura, who is now surpassed by Naruto. Character development based on female roles, when it does occur, again uses stereotypical roles: Tsunade, for example, a middle-aged woman with large breasts, is a clear mother figure, and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja, which requires special skills possessed only by women, the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers. Tsunade herself, who is a figure of authority in &quot;Naruto&quot;, is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not. Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga.
