<text>Pierre Pithou (1 November 1539 – 1 November 1596) was a French lawyer and scholar. He is also known as Petrus Pithoeus.

==Life==
He was born at Troyes. From childhood he loved literature, and his father Pierre encouraged this interest. Young Pithou was called to the Paris bar in 1560. On the outbreak of the second war of religion in 1567, Pithou, who was a Calvinist, withdrew to Sedan, France and afterwards to Basel, returning to France on the publication of the edict of pacification. Soon afterwards he accompanied the duc de Montmorency on his embassy to England, returning shortly before the massacre of St Bartholomew, in which he narrowly escaped with his life. Next year he followed the example of the future Henry IV of France by abjuring the Protestant faith.

Henry, shortly after his accession to the throne, recognized Pithou&#x27;s talents and services by giving him various legal appointments. He co-operated in publishing the &quot;Satire Ménippée&quot; (1593), which did much to damage the cause of the Catholic League; the harangue of the &quot;Sieur d&#x27;Aubray&quot; is usually attributed to Pithou.

Pithou wrote many legal and historical books, besides preparing editions of several ancient writers. His earliest publication was &quot;Adversariorum subsectorum lib. II.&quot; (1565). In 1569, he became the first to publish Landolfus Sagax&#x27; &quot;Historia Romana&quot;, and under the name by which it became better known: &quot;Historia Miscella&quot;. Perhaps his edition of the &quot;Leges Visigothorum&quot; (1579) was his most valuable contribution to historical science; in the same line he edited the &quot;Capitula&quot; of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious, and Charles the Bald in 1588; he assisted his brother François in preparing the &quot;Corpus juris canonici&quot; (1687).

Pierre&#x27;s &quot;Libertés de l&#x27;église gallicane&quot; (1594) is reprinted in his &quot;Opera sacra juridica his orica miscellanea collecta&quot; (1609). In classical literature he was the first who made the world acquainted with the &quot;Fables of Phaedrus&quot; (1596).

Pithou contributed to the study of Livy, in collating a manuscript against the edition of Sigonius, and adding notes. It was not published, but has been cited as &quot;Excerpta-&quot;, &quot;Exc-&quot; and &quot;notulae Pithoei&quot;, and remains in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

He died at Nogent-sur-Seine. His valuable library, specially rich in manuscripts, was for the most part transferred to what is now the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.

==Family==
Three of Pierre Pithou&#x27;s brothers acquired distinction as jurists: Nicolas, with his twin, Jean co-authored the treatise, &quot;Institution du mariage chrétien&quot;. François Pithou, the youngest, wrote &quot;Glossarium ad libros capitularium&quot; (1588) and &quot;Traité de l&#x27;excommunication et de l&#x27;interdit, etc.&quot; (1587).

<text>The Penn Central Transportation Company, commonly abbreviated to Penn Central, was an American class I railroad that operated from 1968 to 1976. Penn Central combined three traditional corporate rivals (the Pennsylvania, New York Central and the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroads), all united by large-scale service into the New York metropolitan area and (to a lesser extent) New England and Chicago. The new company failed barely two years after formation, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at the time. The Penn Central&#x27;s railroad assets were nationalized into Conrail along with the other bankrupt northeastern railroads; its real estate and insurance holdings successfully reorganized into American Premier Underwriters.

==History==
=== Pre-merger ===
The Penn Central railroad system developed in response to challenges facing northeastern American railroads during the late 1960s. While railroads elsewhere in North America drew revenues from long-distance shipments of commodities such as coal, lumber, paper and iron ore, railroads in the densely-populated northeast traditionally depended on a heterogeneous mix of services, including:

* commuter/intercity passenger rail service
* Railway Express Agency freight service
* Break-bulk freight service via boxcars
* Consumer goods and perishables (produce and dairy products)

These labor-intensive, short-haul services proved vulnerable to competition from automobiles, buses, and trucks, a threat recently invigorated by the new limited-access highways authorized in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. At the same time, contemporary railroad regulation restricted the extent to which U.S. railroads could react to the new market conditions. Changes to passenger fares and freight shipment rates required approval from the capricious Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), as did mergers or abandonment of lines. Merger, which eliminated duplicative back office employees, seemed an escape.

The situation was particularly acute for the Pennsylvania (PRR) and New York Central (NYC) railroads. Both had extensive physical plants dedicated to their passenger custom. As that revenue stream faded following WWII, neither could slim their assets fast enough to earn a substantial profit (although the NYC came much closer).

In 1957, the two proposed a merger, despite severe organizational and regulatory hurdles. Neither railroad had much respect for its merger partner; the lines had fought bitterly over New York-Chicago custom and ill-will remained in the executive suites. Amongst middle management, the company&#x27;s corporate cultures all but precluded integration: a team of young, flexible managers had begun reshaping the NYC from a traditional railroad into a multimodal express-freight transporter, while the PRR continued to bet on a railroad revival. At a technical level, the two companies served independent markets east of Cleveland (running through their namesake states), but virtually identical trackage west of Cleveland meant any merger would have anticompetitive effect.

For decades, merger proposals had tried to balance the competitors instead, joining them with lesser partners end-to-end. The unexpected NYC+PRR proposal required all the northeastern railroads to reconsider their corporate strategy, clouding the waters for the ICC. The resulting negotiations took nearly a decade, and when the PRR and NYC merged, they faced three competitors of comparable size: the Erie had merged with the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western to create the Erie Lackawanna Railway (EL) in 1960, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) acquired control of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio (B&amp;O) in 1963, and the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway (N&amp;W) absorbed several railroads, including the Nickel Plate and the Wabash, in 1964.

Regulators also required the new company to incorporate the bankrupt New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad (NH) and New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Railway (NYS&amp;W); if neither the N&amp;W and C&amp;O would buy the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LV), then that railroad should be incorporated as well. Ultimately, only the New Haven successfully joined the Penn Central; the conglomerate failed before it could incorporate the latter two. The only railroad leaving the Penn Central was the PRR&#x27;s controlling interest in the N&amp;W, whose dividends had generated much of the PRR&#x27;s premerger profitability.

===Merger begins===
The legal merger (formally, an acquisition of the NYC by the PRR) concluded on February 1, 1968. The Pennsylvania Railroad, the nominal survivor of the merger, changed its name to Pennsylvania New York Central Transportation Company, and soon began using &quot;Penn Central&quot; as a trade name. That trade name became official a month later on May 8, 1968. Saunders later commented: &quot;Because of the many years it took to consummate the merger, the morale of both railroads was badly disrupted and they were faced with unmanageable problems which were insurmountable. In addition to overcoming obstacles, the principal problem was too much governmental regulation and a passenger deficit which amounted to more than $100 million a year.&quot;

Almost immediately after the transaction cleared, the organizational headwinds presaged during the merger negotiations began to overwhelm the new corporation&#x27;s management. As ex-PRR managers began to secure the plum jobs, the forward-thinking ex-NYC managers departed for greener pastures. Clashing union contracts prevented the company&#x27;s left hand from talking to its right, and incompatible computer systems meant that PC classification clerks regularly lost track of train movements.

Subpar track conditions, the result of years of deferred maintenance, deteriorated further, particularly in the Midwest. Derailments and wrecks occurred regularly; when the trains avoided mishap, they operated far below design speed, resulting in delayed shipments and excessive overtime. Operating costs soared, and shippers soured on the products. In 1969, most of Maine&#x27;s potato production rotted in the PC&#x27;s Selkirk Yard, hurting the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad, whose shippers vowed never to ship by rail again. Although both PRR and NYC had been profitable pre-merger, Penn Central was — at one point — losing $1 million per day.

As PC&#x27;s management struggled to wrestle the company into submission, the structural headwinds facing all northeastern railroads continued unabated. The industrial decline of the Rust Belt consumed shippers through the Northeast and Midwest. Penn Central&#x27;s executives tried to diversify the troubled firm into real estate and other non-railroad ventures, but in a slow economy these businesses performed little better than the original railroad assets. Worse, these new subsidiaries diverted management attention away from the problems in the core business. 

To create the illusion of success, management also insisted on paying dividends to shareholders, desperately borrowing funds to buy time for the business to turn around. Thanks to the dubious accounting strategies of the company&#x27;s CFO David C. Bevan the railroad had done a good job in &#x27;68 and &#x27;69 of concealing the company&#x27;s true state to get the money they needed. For example the losses given for 1969 were only $5 million, while in reality the true figure was around $220 million. The numbers were hidden to such an extent that not even Saunders knew how bad it really was.

All of this financial wrangling was technically legal thanks to the fact that the SEC did not have purview over railroads. That was instead handled by the ICC, which was much more lenient with that sort of thing. Many banks were still wary of how unspecific their reports had become, and it would get progressively harder and harder to get loans as time went on.

=== Bankruptcy ===

By 1970 the situation had become dire. Banks had mostly stopped giving loans, while at the same time around $150 million worth of debts were due that year. The railroad had lost over $100 million in the first quarter. Bevan confided in Saunders the true financial picture, and Saunders then got to work trying to get the government to give them a loan guarantee. What they wanted was $750 million from congress, and if that didn&#x27;t work they could get $200 million directly from the Department of Defense. Penn Central argued that it was technically a defense contractor because of the large amount of freight they carried for the military.

This ended up backfiring for Saunders since one of the demands placed on the railroad to get the loans was to change up the executive suite. Saunders thought this only meant Bevan would be fired, and called a meeting to act on the demand. The board instead fired both of them. They also used to opportunity to fire Perlman which they had wanted to do for a while. Despite the concessions, in the end opposition from southern politicians crushed both plans for loans. With all of their options having dried up Penn Central voted on June 21, 1970 to file for chapter 77 bankruptcy.

At the time of the bankruptcy Penn Central was the nation&#x27;s sixth-largest corporation and had become its largest bankruptcy. (The Enron Corporation&#x27;s 2001 bankruptcy eclipsed the PC in large measure). George Drury described the bankruptcy as &quot;a cataclysmic event, both to the railroad industry and to the nation&#x27;s business community,&quot; not least because Penn Central increasingly appeared the proverbial canary in the coal mine. Across the nation, railroads discontinued Penn Central&#x27;s core business (passenger trains) as fast as regulators would let them. The Rock Island, midway through a decade spent arguing with regulators about a merger, was stumbling towards another stunning bankruptcy, as was the Milwaukee Road, the nation&#x27;s most technologically advanced transcontinental.

The new president of the railroad, Paul H. Gorman, quickly left after the bankruptcy. The search for a new president was concluded when the Southern Railway&#x27;s, Graham Claytor offered up William H. &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Moore to head the company. Moore had been a protégé of the previous Southern president, D. William Brosnan who had been known for both cutting costs, and for routinely firing workers on the spot. On one occasion he had thrown a desk at a vice president he had fired. For this behavior Brosnan had been ousted from the presidency, and Claytor did not appreciate Moore&#x27;s continued presence, which ultimately is why he was chosen for the position.

When he assumed the presidency, Moore had set out to do as he had been taught by Brosnan, and worked to slash budgets; sensibly or otherwise. Plans to invest into new yards that had been made by Perlman were all scrapped, and track maintenance was done as minimally as it could be. Additionally he gave more radios to switch crews and closed many unautomated hump yards.

In 1972, the damage from Hurricane Agnes destroyed important Penn Central branches and main lines, and pushed the other northeastern roads into bankruptcy. By the mid-1970s, no major player east of Rochester-Pittsburgh, north of Pittsburgh-Philadelphia, and southwest of the Maine-New Hampshire border remained solvent. 
Under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), Penn Central agreed to trial new technologies to revive the flagging passenger services on what would become the Northeast Corridor. PC continued to operate the PRR&#x27;s &quot;Metroliner&quot; service between New York City and DC, and introduced a new United Aircraft TurboTrain between New York City and Boston. But the new equipment proved useless without high-quality track to run it on, or a railroad capable of releasing schedules to the ticket-seeking public. In response, the Nixon administration developed Amtrak, which relieved any railroad that desired it of the obligation to operate passenger service.

PC unsuccessfully attempted to sell-off the air rights to Grand Central Terminal, and allow developers to build skyscrapers above the terminal, in order to fund continued operations. The resulting lawsuit, &quot;Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City&quot;, was decided in 1978, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that PC could not sell Grand Central&#x27;s air rights because the terminal was a New York City designated landmark.

By 1974 the railroad&#x27;s physical plant was in an abysmal state. Deferred maintenance, and damage from Hurricane Agnes had pushed the railroad to where in a single month it suffered 649 derailments. The hump yard in Cleveland, Ohio was averaging 6 derailments every day. It was also around this time when there were reported &quot;standing derailments&quot; where rotted cross ties on the track would break under the weight of an unmoving car. In 1973 the Federal Railroad Administration had done an inspection of PC&#x27;s mainlines and come to the conclusion that the entire railroad would need to be shut down if the situation was not fixed soon.

Something had to be done, and while that was on the horizon; a short term fix was to just fire Moore. A lot of people at the railroad hated him. This came to a head just before Christmas of 1973 as Moore had been taking a Metroliner from D.C. to Philadelphia, when the train stopped just outside of the tunnel into Baltimore. 20 coal hoppers had derailed in the tunnel, and Moore went to the train telephone to tell the division superintendent he wanted it cleared in an hour. After an hour he went back to the phone, and fired the superintendent on the spot. Following this an engineer in another train phoned in to say &quot;Merry Christmas to you, too, you son of a bitch.&quot; Moore then realized he had accidentally routed the call over the P.A. system, and everything had been played over the loudspeaker in every car. The chief trustee, Jervis Langdon Jr. heard about this and was quickly able to get rid of Moore and insert himself as the new president thanks to the fact that Moore had also been using railroad employees to work on his house. Langdon took over January 4, 1974, and the superintendent was rehired the same day.

In May 1974, the bankruptcy court concluded that the railroad operations of PC could never provide enough income to reorganize the company. In the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, the federal government nationalized Penn Central to save it. For two years, the United States Railway Association sorted through the assets of PC (and six other bankrupt railroads: Erie Lackawanna, Lehigh Valley Railroad, Reading Company, Lehigh &amp; Hudson River Railway, Central Railroad of New Jersey and Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines) to decide what could be reshaped into a viable railroad. Then, on April 1, 1976, Penn Central transferred those rail operations to the government-owned Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail).

Facing the continued loss of market share to the trucking industry, the railroad industry and its unions asked the federal government for deregulation. The 1980 Staggers Act, which deregulated the railroad industry, proved to be a key factor in bringing Conrail and the old PC assets back to life. During the 1980s, the deregulated Conrail had the muscle to implement the route reorganization and productivity improvements that the PC had unsuccessfully tried to implement between 1968 and 1970. Hundred of miles of former PRR and NYC trackage were abandoned to adjacent landowners or rail trail use. The stock of the subsequently-profitable Conrail was refloated on Wall Street in 1987, and the company operated as an independent, private-sector railroad from 1987 to 1999.

==Corporate survival==
The Pennsylvania Railroad absorbed the New York Central Railroad on February 1, 1968, and at the same time changed its name to Pennsylvania New York Central Transportation Company to reflect this. The trade name of &quot;Penn Central&quot; was adopted, and, on May 8, the former Pennsylvania Railroad was officially renamed the Penn Central Company.

The first Penn Central Transportation Company (PCTC) was incorporated on April 1, 1969, and its stock was assigned to a new holding company called Penn Central Holding Company. On October 1, 1969, the Penn Central Company, the former Pennsylvania Railroad, absorbed the first PCTC and was renamed the second Penn Central Transportation Company the next day; the Penn Central Holding Company became the second Penn Central Company. Thus, the company that was formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad became the first Penn Central Company and then became the second PCTC.

The old Pennsylvania Company, a holding company chartered in 1870, reincorporated in 1958 and long a subsidiary of the PRR, remained a separate corporate entity throughout the period following the merger.

The former Pennsylvania Railroad, now the second PCTC, gave up its railroad assets to Conrail in 1976 and absorbed its legal owner, the second Penn Central Company, in 1978, and at the same time changed its name to The Penn Central Corporation. In the 1970s and 1980s, the company now called The Penn Central Corporation was a small conglomerate that largely consisted of the diversified sub-firms it had before the crash.

Among the properties the company owned when Conrail was created were the Buckeye Pipeline and a 24 percent stake in Madison Square Garden (which stands above Penn Station) and its prime tenants, the New York Knicks basketball team and New York Rangers hockey team, along with Six Flags Theme Parks. Though the company retained ownership of some rights-of-way and station properties connected with the railroads, it continued to liquidate these and eventually concentrated on one of its subsidiaries in the insurance business.

The former Pennsylvania Railroad changed its name to American Premier Underwriters in March 1994. It became part of Carl Lindner&#x27;s Cincinnati financial empire American Financial Group.

===Grand Central Terminal===

Until late 2006, American Financial Group still owned Grand Central Terminal, though all railroad operations were managed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The U.S. Surface Transportation Board approved the sale of several of American Financial Group&#x27;s remaining railroad assets to Midtown TDR Ventures LLC, an investment group controlled by Argent Ventures, in December 2006. The current lease with the MTA was negotiated to last through February 28, 2274. The MTA paid $2.4 million annually in rent in 2007 and had an option to buy the station and tracks in 2017, although Argent could extend the date another 15 years to 2032. The assets included the of rail used by the Hudson and Harlem Lines, and Grand Central Terminal, as well as unused development rights above the tracks in Midtown Manhattan. The platforms and yards extend for several blocks north of the terminal building under numerous streets and existing buildings leasing air rights, including the MetLife Building and Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.

In November 2018, the MTA proposed purchasing the Hudson and Harlem Lines as well as the Grand Central Terminal for up to $35.065 million, plus a discount rate of 6.25%. The purchase would include all inventory, operations, improvements, and maintenance associated with each asset, except for the air rights over Grand Central. The MTA&#x27;s finance committee approved the proposed purchase on November 13, 2018, and the purchase was approved by the full board two days later. The deal finally closed in March 2020, with the MTA taking ownership of the terminal and rail lines.

==Heritage==
Few railroad historians and former employees view the mega-railroad&#x27;s brief existence favorably, and the company has little presence in the railroad enthusiast press. The preservation group &quot;Penn Central Railroad Historical Society&quot; was formed in July 2000 to preserve the history of the often-scorned company.

As part of Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s 30th anniversary, the railroad painted 20 new locomotives utilizing former liveries of predecessor railroads. Unit number 1073, a SD70ACe, is painted in a Penn Central Heritage scheme.

As part of the 40th anniversary of the Metro-North Railroad, four locomotives were painted in a different heritage scheme to honor a predecessor railroad. Locomotive 217 was painted in the Penn Central Blue and Yellow scheme.

<doc id="235221" wikidata="Q5021687" url="?curid=235221" title="Call to the bar">
<text>The call to the bar is a legal term of art in most common law jurisdictions where persons must be qualified to be allowed to argue in court on behalf of another party and are then said to have been &quot;called to the bar&quot; or to have received &quot;call to the bar&quot;. &quot;The bar&quot; is now used as a collective noun for barristers, but literally referred to the wooden barrier in old courtrooms, which separated the often crowded public area at the rear from the space near the judges reserved for those having business with the court. Barristers would sit or stand immediately behind it, facing the judge, and could use it as a table for their briefs.

Like many other common law terms, the term originated in England in the Middle Ages, and the &quot;call to the bar&quot; refers to the summons issued to one found fit to speak at the &quot;bar&quot; of the royal courts. In time, English judges allowed only legally qualified men to address them on the law and later delegated the qualification and admission of barristers to the four Inns of Court. Once an inn calls one of its members to its bar, they are thereafter a barrister. They may not, however, practise as a barrister until they have completed (or been exempted from) an apprenticeship called &quot;pupillage&quot;. After completing pupillage, they are considered to be a practising barrister with a right of audience before all courts.

England and Wales and some other jurisdictions distinguish two types of lawyers, who are regulated by different bodies, with separate training, examinations, regulation and traditions:
* Barristers primarily practise in court and generally specialise in advocacy in a particular field of law; they have a right of audience in all courts of England and Wales. 
* Solicitors do not necessarily undertake court work, but have a right of audience in the lower courts (magistrates&#x27; courts and county courts). They are &quot;admitted&quot; or &quot;enrolled&quot; as a solicitor, to conduct litigation and practise in law outside court, e.g., providing legal advice to lay clients and acting on their behalf in legal matters.

A solicitor must qualify as a solicitor-advocate in order to acquire the same &quot;higher rights&quot; of audience as a barrister. In other jurisdictions, the terminology and the degree of overlap between the roles of solicitor and barrister varies greatly; in most, the distinction has disappeared entirely.

==Particular jurisdictions==
Common law jurisdictions include Australia, England and Wales, New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Nigeria, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and most jurisdictions in the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States (the &quot;See also&quot; section below contains links to articles on the laws of these jurisdictions).

=== Australia===
In Australia, the status of the legal profession differs from state to state:

* Queensland and New South Wales formally split the legal profession between solicitors and barristers;
* South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have &quot;fused&quot; the professions of barrister and solicitor, but each state maintains an independent bar for lawyers who solely practice as barristers; and
* Tasmania and the Northern Territory have fused professions, with a very small number of legal practitioners operating as an independent bar.

Most Australian barristers will have previously worked as solicitors prior to becoming barristers.

Candidates wishing to become barristers may have to pass an examination and undergo further specialised training before those candidates are &quot;called to the bar&quot; or &quot;sign the roll of counsel&quot;. Both the examination and the further training are administered by the state&#x27;s bar association:

* in Queensland, candidates must pass &quot;three 1.5 hour examinations, focusing on legal ethics, practice and procedure, and evidence&quot;, and then successfully complete the Bar Practice Course;
* in New South Wales, candidates must pass the NSW Bar Examination, and then successfully complete the Bar Practice Course; and
* in Victoria, candidates must pass the Victorian Bar Entrance Exam, and then successfully complete the Victorian Bar Readers&#x27; Course.

Upon completing the relevant training course, new barristers (&quot;readers&quot;) are required to spend a period of months &quot;reading&quot; in the chambers of an experienced barrister, called the reader&#x27;s &quot;tutor&quot; (in New South Wales) or &quot;mentor&quot; (in Victoria) (historically, this experienced barrister was called the new barrister&#x27;s &quot;pupil master&quot;). This &quot;reading&quot; period serves as a kind of practical apprenticeship for the new barrister, who works in the same chambers as their tutor/mentor and is able to learn by observing their tutor/mentor, as well as actively seeking their guidance.

===Canada===
In common law Canadian provinces, despite the unified legal profession (lawyers are qualified as both barristers and solicitors), the certificate issued by the provincial Law Society to the newly qualified lawyer generally indicates his or her having been called to the bar and admitted as a solicitor. 

In Ontario and Manitoba, there are two certificates, one issued by the respective provincial Law Society for call to the bar and the other by the Superior Court (Ontario) or Court of King&#x27;s Bench (Manitoba) for admission as a solicitor. 

In Ontario, being called to the bar requires students to article (apprentice) with a law firm for ten months, but due to a shortage of articling positions available each year and an influx of articling candidates, a pilot alternative program available through the University of Ottawa and Toronto Metropolitan University was established. The Law Practice Program requires the articling students to spend four months in a virtual law office and to spend another four months in a work placement. 

Alberta and Prince Edward Island are the only common law jurisdictions with individual, rather than group, calls. The student&#x27;s supervisor, referred to as his or her principal, makes an oral application to the Provincial Court of Alberta or Court of King&#x27;s Bench, or the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, respectively, to have the student called to the bar. Gowns are worn and the ceremony is public, with the presiding judge (or judges) welcoming the new member with a speech written specifically for that call. 

In Quebec, a civil law notary is very similar to a solicitor.

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, a call ceremony takes place at the barrister&#x27;s Inn of Court (or at Temple Church for members of the Inner Temple), before or during the pupillage year. A barrister is called to the &quot;utter&quot; (&quot;outer&quot;) bar or &quot;appointed to the degree of the utter bar&quot;. Those appointed as King&#x27;s Counsel (Queen&#x27;s Counsel if the monarch is female) are entitled to plead from &quot;within the bar&quot; in court.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the legal profession is split between solicitors and barristers. Candidates wishing to qualify as barristers must complete a series of examinations at the Honorable Society of King&#x27;s Inns. Successful candidates are called to the Bar by the Chief Justice in the Supreme Court. Upon being called to the bar, a barrister becomes a member of the Outer Bar, or &quot;Junior Counsel&quot;. Some barristers may subsequently be called to the Inner Bar in a similar ceremony, gaining the title &quot;Senior Counsel&quot;.

===New Zealand===
As in Canada, the legal profession is fused. A lawyer in New Zealand is admitted as either a &quot;barrister sole&quot; or a &quot;barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand&quot;. Once admitted, New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;barrister and solicitors&quot; are able to practise in either mode provided they hold a practising certificate, while barristers sole are entitled only to practice as a barrister. Admission is overseen by the New Zealand Law Society.

===Nigeria===
As in New Zealand, there is no formal distinction between barristers and solicitors. A lawyer in Nigeria is admitted as a &quot;Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria&quot;. Once admitted, Nigerian lawyers may argue in any federal trial or appellate court as well as any of the courts in Nigeria&#x27;s thirty six states and the Federal Capital Territory. Lawyers are regulated by the Nigerian Bar Association.

===Northern Ireland===
Prior to the partition of Ireland, barristers in what is now Northern Ireland were called to the bar in the same manner as those in the rest of Ireland. The procedure remains much the same today, save that candidates wishing to qualify as barristers must complete a series of examinations at the Institute of Professional Legal Studies at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (under the supervision of the Honourable Society of the Inn of Court of Northern Ireland), barristers are called to the bar by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland and members of the Inner Bar are known as King&#x27;s Counsel.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, a lawyer must be admitted and enrolled as an attorney-at-law of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. This is referred to as the call to the bar.

===United States===
Generally, lawyer qualification is a U.S. state matter and a lawyer is said to have been &quot;admitted to the bar&quot; and become an &quot;attorney at law&quot;; some states still use the older term &quot;attorney and counselor (also spelled &#x27;counsellor&#x27;) at law&quot;, upon taking his or her oath of office. Historically, the institution of attorney was similar to that of the solicitor, whereas the office of the counselor was almost identical to that of the barrister, but today this distinction has disappeared. The phrase &quot;called to the bar&quot; is still sometimes used informally by U.S. attorneys to refer to their qualification as a lawyer.

<text>Admission to the bar in the United States is the granting of permission by a particular court system to a lawyer to practice law in the jurisdiction. Each U.S. state and jurisdiction (e.g. territories under federal control) has its own court system and sets its own rules and standards for bar admission. In most cases, a person is admitted or called to the bar of the highest court in the jurisdiction and is thereby authorized to practice law in the jurisdiction. Federal courts, although often overlapping in admission requirements with states, include additional steps for admission.

Typically, lawyers seeking admission to the bar of one of the U.S. states must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, pass a bar exam and professional responsibility examination, and undergo a character and fitness evaluation, with some exceptions to each requirement.

A lawyer admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another&#x27;s bar exam.

==Terminology==
The use of the term bar comes from English custom. In the early 16th century, a railing divided the hall in the Inns of Court, with students occupying the body of the hall and readers or benchers on the other side. Students who officially became lawyers were &quot;called to the bar&quot;, crossing the symbolic physical barrier and thus &quot;admitted to the bar&quot;. In modern courtrooms, a railing may still be in place to enclose the space which is occupied by legal counsel as well as the criminal defendants and civil litigants who are before the court.

== History ==
The first bar exam in what is now the United States was instituted by Delaware Colony in 1763, as an oral examination before a judge. Many other American colonies soon followed suit. In the early United States, most states&#x27; requirements for bar admission included a period of study under a lawyer or judge (a practice called &quot;reading the law&quot;) and a brief examination. Examinations were generally oral, and applicants were sometimes exempted from the examination if they had clerked in a law office for a certain number of years. During the 19th century, admission requirements became lower in many states. Most states continued to require both apprenticeship and examination, but these apprenticeships became shorter and examinations generally brief and casual.

After 1870, law schools began to emerge across the United States as an alternative to apprenticeship. This rise was accompanied by the practice of diploma privilege, wherein graduates of law schools received automatic admission to the bar. Diploma privilege reached its peak between 1879 and 1921. In most states, diploma privilege only applied to those who had graduated law school in the state where they practiced. Examinations continued to exist during this period as requirements for those ineligible for diploma privilege, and were often administered by committees of attorneys. Between 1890 and 1920, most states replaced oral examinations with written bar examinations. Written examinations became commonplace as lawyers began to practice in states other than those where they were trained.

In 1921, the American Bar Association formally expressed a preference for required written bar examinations in place of diploma privilege for law school graduates. In subsequent decades, the prevalence of diploma privilege declined deeply. By 1948, only 13 law schools in 9 states retained diploma privilege. By 1980, only Mississippi, Montana, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin honored diploma privilege. As of 2020, only Wisconsin allows J.D. graduates of accredited law schools to seek admission to the state bar without passing a bar examination.

==Admission requirements==
Today, each U.S. jurisdiction has its own rules which govern admission to its bar. Generally, admission to a bar requires that a candidate does the following:

* Earn a Juris Doctor degree or read law
* Pass a professional responsibility examination or equivalent
* Pass a bar examination (except where diploma privilege is allowed)
* Undergo a character and fitness certification
* Formally apply for admission and pay required fees

===Educational requirement===

Most jurisdictions require that candidates earn a Juris Doctor degree from an approved law school, usually a school accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). Exceptions include Alabama, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, West Virginia, and Tennessee, which allow individuals who have graduated from state-approved law schools to take the bar exam. The state of New York makes special provision for persons educated in the common law overseas, with most LLB degree holders being qualified to take the bar exam and be admitted to the bar. In California, the Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE) of the State Bar of California allows graduates of certain &quot;registered&quot; law schools to take the California Bar Examination, although those schools are not accredited by the ABA or the CBE. However, students at such law schools must take and pass the First-Year Law Students&#x27; Examination (commonly referred to as the &quot;baby bar&quot;) administered by the CBE, and may continue their studies upon passage of this exam.

Four jurisdictions, namely California, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, allow applicants to study under a judge or practicing attorney for an extended period of time rather than attending any law school. This method is known as &quot;reading law&quot; or &quot;reading the law&quot;. New York requires bar applicants who have &quot;read law&quot; to also have at least one year of law school study. Maine allows students with two years of law school to serve an apprenticeship in lieu of their third year. New Hampshire&#x27;s only law school has an alternative licensing program that allows students who have completed certain curricula and a separate exam to bypass the regular bar examination. Until the late 19th century, reading the law was common and law schools were rare. For example, Abraham Lincoln did not attend law school, and did not even read with anyone else.

Unlike some other jurisdictions, the American legal system, generally, has no formal apprenticeship or clinical training requirements for bar admission, with a few exceptions. Delaware requires that applicants serve five months in a clerkship with a lawyer in the state. Vermont had a similar requirement but eliminated it in 2016. Washington requires, since 2005, that applicants complete a minimum of four hours of approved pre-admission education. Some law schools have tried to rectify this lack of experience by requiring supervised &quot;Public Service Requirements&quot; of all graduates. States that encourage law students to undergo clinical training or perform public service in the form of pro bono representation may allow students to appear and practice in limited court settings under the supervision of an admitted attorney.

===Professional responsibility requirement===
In all jurisdictions except Puerto Rico and Wisconsin, candidates must pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE), which covers the professional responsibility rules governing lawyers. This test is not administered separately from bar examinations, and most candidates usually sit for the MPRE while still in law school, right after studying professional responsibility (a required course in all ABA-accredited law schools). Some states require that a candidate pass the MPRE before being allowed to sit for the bar exam. Connecticut and New Jersey waive the MPRE for candidates who have received a grade of C or better in a law school professional ethics class.

===Bar examination requirement===

In all jurisdictions except Wisconsin and Oregon, candidates are required to pass a bar examination, usually administered by the state bar association or under the authority of the supreme court of the particular state. Wisconsin and Oregon are the only states that do not require the bar examination. In Wisconsin, graduates of ABA-accredited law schools in the state (currently the University of Wisconsin Law School and Marquette University Law School) may be admitted to the state bar through diploma privilege. Oregon permits students who have completed a Juris Doctor program with certain required coursework to obtain bar admission through a Supervised Practice Portfolio Examination.

State bar examinations are usually administered by the state bar association or under the authority of the supreme court of the particular state. In 2011, the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) created the Uniform Bar Examination (UBE), which has since been adopted by 37 jurisdictions (out of a possible 56). The UBE consists of three parts: the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), a standardized test consisting of 200 multiple-choice questions; the Multistate Essay Examination (MEE), a uniform though not standardized test that examines a candidate&#x27;s ability to analyze legal issues and communicate them effectively in writing; and the Multistate Performance Test (MPT), a &quot;closed-universe&quot; test in which each candidate is required to perform a standard lawyering task, such as a memo or brief.

Non-UBE jurisdictions usually also include a combination of multiple-choice questions, essay questions, and performance tests. Many jurisdictions use some NCBE-created components. For example, all jurisdictions except Louisiana and Puerto Rico use the MBE. Many states also use state-specific content is usually included in the examination, such as essays in Washington, Minnesota and Massachusetts. Some states, such as Florida, include both essays and multiple-choice questions in their state-specific sections; Virginia uses full essays and short-answer questions in its state-specific section.

===Character and fitness requirement===
Most states also require an applicant to demonstrate good moral character. Character Committees look to an applicant&#x27;s history to determine whether the person will be fit to practice law in the future. This history may include prior criminal arrests or convictions, academic honor code violations, prior bankruptcies or evidence of financial irresponsibility, addictions or psychiatric disorders, sexual misconduct, prior civil lawsuits or driving history. In recent years, such investigations have increasingly focused on the extent of an applicant&#x27;s financial debt, as increased student loans have prompted concern for whether a new lawyer will honor legal or financial obligations. For example, in early 2009, a person who had passed the New York bar and had over $400,000 in unpaid student loans was denied admission by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division due to excessive indebtedness, despite being recommended for admission by the state&#x27;s character and fitness committee. He moved to void the denial, but the court upheld its original decision in November 2009, by which time his debt had accumulated to nearly $500,000. More recently, the Court of Appeals of Maryland rejected the application of a candidate who displayed a pattern of financial irresponsibility, applied for a car loan with false information, and failed to disclose a recent bankruptcy. Most states require an applicant to secure character certification from the law school attended and also provide additional character references.

When applying to take a state&#x27;s bar examination, applicants are required to complete extensive questionnaires seeking the disclosure of significant personal, financial and professional information. For example, in Virginia, each applicant must complete a 24-page questionnaire and may appear before a committee for an interview if the committee initially rejects their application. The same is true in the State of Maryland, and in many other jurisdictions, where the state&#x27;s supreme court has the ultimate authority to determine whether an applicant will be admitted to the bar. In completing the bar application, and at all stages of this process, honesty is paramount. An applicant who fails to disclose material facts, no matter how embarrassing or problematic, will greatly jeopardize the applicant&#x27;s chance of practicing law.

===Formal admission===
Once all prerequisites have been satisfied, an attorney must formally apply for admission. The mechanics of this final stage vary widely. For example, in California, the admittee simply takes an oath before any state judge or notary public, who then co-signs the admission form. Upon receiving the signed form, the State Bar of California adds the new admittee to a list of applicants recommended for admission to the bar which is automatically ratified by the Supreme Court of California at its next regular weekly conference; then everyone on the list is added to the official roll of attorneys. The State Bar also holds large-scale formal admission ceremonies in conjunction with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the federal district courts, usually in the same convention centers where new admittees took the bar examination, but these are optional. In other jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia, new admittees &quot;must&quot; attend a special session of court in person to take the oath of admission in open court; they cannot take the oath before any available judge or notary public.

A successful applicant is permitted to practice law after being sworn in as an officer of the Court; in most states, that means they may begin filing pleadings and appearing as counsel of record in any trial or appellate court in the state. Upon admission, a new lawyer is issued a certificate of admission, usually from the state&#x27;s highest court, and a membership card attesting to admission.

Two states are exceptions to the general rule of admission by the state&#x27;s highest court. In New York, admission is granted by one of the state&#x27;s four intermediate appellate courts corresponding generally to the Department of residence of the applicant; once admitted, however, the applicant can practice in any (non-federal) court in the state. In Georgia, each new attorney is admitted to practice by the Superior Court of any county, typically the county in which he or she resides or desires to practice. The new attorney, although licensed to practice in any local trial court in the state, must &quot;separately&quot; seek admission to the Georgia Court of Appeals as well as the Georgia Supreme Court.

In most states, lawyers are also issued a unique bar identification number. In states like California where unauthorized practice of law is a major problem, the state bar number must appear on all documents submitted by a lawyer.

==Admission in multiple states==

Most attorneys seek and obtain admission only to the bar of one state, and then rely upon &quot;pro hac vice&quot; admissions for the occasional out-of-state matter. However, many new attorneys do seek admission in multiple states, either by taking multiple bar exams or applying for reciprocity. This is common for those living and working in metro areas which sprawl into multiple states, such as Washington, D.C., and New York City. Attorneys based in predominantly rural states or rural areas near state borders frequently seek admission in multiple states in order to enlarge their client base.

Note that in states that allow reciprocity, admission on motion may have conditions that do not apply to those admitted by examination. For example, attorneys admitted on motion in Virginia are required to show evidence of the intent to practice full-time in Virginia and are prohibited from maintaining an office in any other jurisdiction. Also, their licenses automatically expire when they no longer maintain an office in Virginia.

==Types of state bar associations==
Admission to a state&#x27;s bar is not necessarily the same as membership in that state&#x27;s bar association. There are two kinds of state bar associations:

===Mandatory (integrated) bar===
Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia require membership in the state&#x27;s bar association to practice law there. This arrangement is called having a mandatory, unified, or integrated bar.

For example, the State Bar of Texas is an agency of the judiciary and is under the administrative control of the Texas Supreme Court, and is composed of those persons licensed to practice law in Texas; each such person is required by law to join the State Bar by registering with the clerk of the Texas Supreme Court.

===Voluntary and private bar associations===
A voluntary bar association is a private organization of lawyers. Each may have social, educational, and lobbying functions, but does not regulate the practice of law or admit lawyers to practice or discipline lawyers. An example of this is the New York State Bar Association.

There is a statewide voluntary bar association in each of the eighteen states that have no mandatory or integrated bar association. There are also many voluntary bar associations organized by geographic area (e.g., Chicago Bar Association), interest group or practice area (e.g., Federal Communications Bar Association), or ethnic or identity community (e.g., Hispanic National Bar Association).

The American Bar Association (ABA) is a nationwide voluntary bar association with the largest membership in the United States. The National Bar Association was formed in 1925 to focus on the interests of African-American lawyers after they were denied membership by the ABA.

==Federal courts==
Although generally requiring state bar admission, admission to a state bar alone does not automatically entitle an individual to practice in federal courts, such as the United States district courts or United States court of appeals. In general, an already state qualified attorney is admitted to the bar of these federal courts upon payment of a fee and taking an oath of admission. An attorney must apply to each district separately. For instance, a Texas attorney who practices in federal courts throughout the state would have to be admitted separately to the Northern District of Texas, the Eastern District, the Southern District, and the Western District. To handle a federal appeal, the attorney would also be required to be admitted separately to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for general appeals and to the Federal Circuit for appeals that fall within that court&#x27;s jurisdiction. As the bankruptcy courts are divisions of the district courts, admission to a particular district court usually includes automatic admission to the corresponding bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy courts require that attorneys attend training sessions on electronic filing before they may file motions.

Some federal district courts have extra admission requirements. For instance, the Southern District of Texas requires attorneys seeking admission to attend a class on that District&#x27;s practice and procedures. The District of Puerto Rico has administered its own bar exam since 2004, part of which is an essay which tests for English proficiency. For some time, the Southern District of Florida administered an entrance exam, but that requirement was eliminated by Court order in February 2012. The District of Rhode Island requires candidates to attend classes and to pass an examination.

An attorney wishing to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States must apply to do so, must be admitted to the bar of the highest court of a state for three years, must be sponsored by two attorneys already admitted to the Supreme Court bar, must pay a fee and must take either a spoken or written oath.

Various specialized courts with subject-matter jurisdiction, including the United States Tax Court, have separate admission requirements. The Tax Court is unusual in that a non-attorney may be admitted to practice. However, the non-attorney must take and pass an examination administered by the Court to be admitted, while attorneys are not required to take the exam. Most members of the Tax Court bar are attorneys.

Admission to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is open to any attorney admitted to practice and in good standing with the U.S. Supreme Court, any of the other federal courts of appeal, any federal district court, the highest court of any state, the Court of International Trade, the Court of Federal Claims, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. An oath and fee are required.

Some federal courts also have voluntary bar associations associated with them. For example, the Bar Association of the Fifth Federal Circuit, the Bar Association of the Third Federal Circuit, or the Association of the Bar of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit all serve attorneys admitted to practice before specific federal courts of appeals.

===District Court Reciprocity===
56 districts (around 60% of all district courts) require an attorney to be admitted to practice in the state where the district court sits. The other 39 districts (around 40% of all district courts) extend admission to certain lawyers admitted in other states, although conditions vary from court to court. Only 13 districts extend admission to attorneys admitted to any U.S. state bar. This requirement is not necessarily consistent within a state. For example, in Ohio, the Southern District generally requires membership in the Ohio state bar for full admission, while full admission to the Northern District is open to all attorneys in good standing with any U.S. jurisdiction. In the Northern District of Ohio, admitted attorneys need not maintain an office in the district, or associate with a local attorney, unless ordered to do so by the court. The District of Vermont requires membership in the Vermont State Bar or membership in the Bar of a federal district court in the First and Second Circuits. The District of Connecticut, within the Second Circuit, will admit any member of the Connecticut bar or of the bar of any United States District Court.

===Patent practice===
Persons wishing to prosecute patent applications (i.e., represent clients in the process of obtaining a patent) must first pass the USPTO registration examination, frequently referred to as the &quot;patent bar.&quot; Detailed information about applying for the registration examination is available in the USPTO&#x27;s General Requirements Bulletin. Although only registered patent attorneys or patent agents can prosecute patent applications in the USPTO, passing the patent bar is not necessary to advise clients on patent infringement, to litigate patent issues in court, or to prosecute trademark applications.

A J.D. degree is not required to sit for the patent bar, but a science or engineering degree is required. Lawyers who pass the patent bar exam may refer to themselves as a patent attorney (rules of legal ethics prohibit lawyers from using the title &quot;patent attorney&quot; unless they are admitted to practice before the USPTO). While patent lawyers have a relevant four-year degree and many have graduate technical degrees, patent litigation attorneys do not have to be patent attorneys, although some are. On the other hand, non-lawyers who pass the patent bar are referred to as &quot;patent agents.&quot; Patent agents may not hold themselves out as licensed attorneys.

Applicants must have U.S. citizenship, permanent residency (a Green Card), or a valid work visa for a patent-related job. An applicant on a work visa, upon passing the exam, is only given &quot;limited recognition&quot; to perform work for the employer listed on the work visa. Only U.S. citizens can maintain their registration in the patent bar while they are working outside the United States. Additionally, the USPTO requires that applicants to the patent bar have earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Applicants are categorized as having earned an accredited &quot;bachelor&#x27;s degree in a recognized technical subject&quot; (category A), having earned a &quot;bachelor&#x27;s degree in another subject&quot; with sufficient credits to qualify for the exam (category B), or having &quot;practical engineering or scientific experience&quot; (category C).

Applicants in &quot;category A&quot; must have an engineering or &quot;hard science&quot; degree in a field listed in the General Requirements Bulletin. Note that the degree field as shown on the diploma must be exactly as it appears on the list; for example, &quot;aerospace engineering&quot; does not qualify under category A, while &quot;aeronautical engineering&quot; does. A computer science degree is accepted under &quot;category A&quot; as long as it is received from an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)-accredited or CSAB-accredited program.

Applicants in &quot;category B&quot; must have earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and must have sufficient credits in science and engineering courses to meet the USPTO&#x27;s requirements; the number of credits depends on the specific discipline. The coursework must include a minimum of eight credit-hours of acceptable classes in either chemistry or physics. Each course being relied upon by the applicant for credit is evaluated by the USPTO&#x27;s Office of Enrollment and Discipline for suitability; see the General Requirements Bulletin for the details. Engineering and Computer Science majors whose degree programs do not meet &quot;category A&quot; requirements (typically due to the named field of the degree or, especially in computer science, lack of program accreditation) can apply under &quot;category B.&quot;

Applicants in &quot;category C&quot; may present evidence of passing the Fundamentals of Engineering exam as proof of technical education. They must also have a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Although the admission requirements allow applicants to substitute proof of technical experience for technical education, this is rarely done in practice.

===Military law===
Service as a member of a military service&#x27;s Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps requires graduation from an ABA-accredited law school, a license to practice law in any state or territory of the United States, and training at the specialized law school of one of the three military services (The Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Legal Center and School for the Army, the Naval Justice School for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and the Air Force Judge Advocate General School for the Air Force).

In a court-martial, the accused is always provided JAG Corps defense counsel at no expense to the accused, but is also entitled to retain private civilian counsel at his or her own expense. Civilian counsel must either be a member of both a federal bar and a state bar, or must be otherwise authorized to practice law by a recognized licensing authority and certified by the military judge as having sufficient familiarity with criminal law as applicable in courts-martial.

<text>Alexander Neckam (8 September 115731 March 1217) was an English poet, theologian, and writer. He was an abbot of Cirencester Abbey from 1213 until his death.

==Early life==
Born on 8 September 1157 in St Albans, Alexander shared his birthday with King Richard I. For this reason, his mother, Hodierna of St Albans, was hired by the royal household under Henry II to serve as a wet nurse for the future monarch. As a result, Alexander was raised as Richard&#x27;s foster-brother in their early years.

==Works==

===&quot;Speculum speculationum&quot;===

The &quot;Speculum speculationum&quot; (edited by Rodney M. Thomson, 1988) is Neckam&#x27;s major surviving contribution to the science of theology. It is unfinished in its current form, but covers a fairly standard range of theological topics derived from Peter Lombard&#x27;s &quot;Sentences&quot; and Augustine. Neckam is not regarded as an especially innovative or profound theologian, although he is notable for his early interest in the ideas of St. Anselm of Canterbury. His outlook in the &quot;Speculum&quot;, a work written very late in his life, probably in 1215, and perhaps drawing heavily on his teaching notes from the past decades, combines an interest in the Platonic writings of earlier 12th-century thinkers such as Thierry of Chartres and William of Conches, with an early appreciation of the newly translated writings of Aristotle and Avicenna. Neckam was a firm admirer of Aristotle as an authority in natural science as well as in the logical arts, one of the first Latin thinkers since antiquity to credit this aspect of the Stagirite&#x27;s output.

In the &quot;Speculum speculationum&quot; Alexander identifies one of his key purposes as combating the Cathar heresy, particularly its belief in dualism. He spends a large part of Book 1 on this, and thereafter passes on to focus on his other key purpose, the application of dialectic logic to the study of theology.

===&quot;De utensilibus&quot; and &quot;De naturis rerum&quot;===

Besides theology, Neckam was interested in the study of grammar and natural history, but his name is chiefly associated with nautical science. In his &quot;De utensilibus&quot; and &quot;De naturis rerum&quot; (both written at about 1190), Neckam has preserved to us the earliest European notices of the magnetized needle as a guide to seamen and the earliest European description of the compass. Outside China, these seem to be the earliest records. It was probably in Paris that Neckam heard how a ship, among its other stores, must have a magnetised needle, mounted on a pivot, which would rotate until it pointed north and thus guide sailors in murky weather or on starless nights. Neckam does not seem to think of this as a startling novelty: he merely records what had apparently become the regular practice of many seamen of the Catholic world.

However, &quot;De naturis rerum&quot; itself was written as a preface to Neckam&#x27;s commentary on the book of Ecclesiastes, itself a part of a wider programme of biblical commentary encompassing the Song of Solomon and the Psalms, representing the three branches of wisdom literature. It was not intended as an independent and free-standing encyclopedic work in its own right, and indeed it is mostly filled with fanciful moralising allegories rather than a detailed natural philosophy.

See Thomas Wright&#x27;s edition of Neckam&#x27;s &quot;De naturis rerum&quot; and &quot;De laudibus divinae sapientiae&quot; in the Rolls Series (1863), and of the &quot;De utensilibus&quot; in his &quot;Volume of Vocabularies&quot;.

Out of all Neckam&#x27;s writings on natural history, the &quot;De naturis rerum&quot;, a sort of manual of the scientific knowledge of the 12th century, is by far the most important: the magnet passage referred to above is in Book 2, Chapter 98 (&quot;De vi attractiva&quot;), p. 183 of Wright&#x27;s edition. The corresponding section in the &quot;De utensilibus&quot; is on p. 114 of the &quot;Volume of Vocabularies&quot;.

===Other works===

Neckam also displays a keen interest in contemporary medical science. In particular he draws many ideas from the philosophical writings of the Salernitan medical master Urso of Calabria, particularly &quot;De commixtionibus elementorum&quot; on humoral theory.

Neckam also wrote &quot;Corrogationes Promethei&quot;, a scriptural commentary prefaced by a treatise on grammatical criticism; a translation of Aesop into Latin elegiacs (six fables from this version, as given in a Paris manuscript, are printed in Robert&#x27;s &quot;Fables inedites&quot;); commentaries, on portions of Aristotle and Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, which remain unprinted, and on Martianus Capella, which has recently received an edition, and on other works.

His version of Aesop&#x27;s fables in elegiac verse, called &quot;Novus Aesopus&quot;, is a collection of 42 fables taken from the prose &quot;Romulus&quot;. He also composed a shorter &quot;Novus Avianus&quot;, taken from Avianus. A supplementary poem to &quot;De laudibus divinae sapientiae&quot;, called simply the &quot;Suppletio defectuum&quot;, covers further material on animals and the natural world, as well as cosmology, free will, astrology and the human soul. An edition of this and several of Neckam&#x27;s minor poems, edited by P. Hochgurtel, was published as a part of the Brepols Corpus Christianorum Continuatio Medievalis series in 2008.

It has been speculated (Spargo, &quot;Virgil the Necromancer&quot;, 1934) that Neckam might also have been unwittingly responsible for starting the late medieval legends about Virgil&#x27;s alleged magical powers. In commenting on Virgil, Neckam used the phrase &quot;Vergilius fecit Culicem&quot; to describe the writing of one of Virgil&#x27;s earlier poems, &quot;Culex&quot; (&quot;The Gnat&quot;). This may have been misinterpreted by later readers as &quot;Virgil made a gnat&quot; and formed the basis for the legend of Virgil&#x27;s magic fly which killed all other flies it came across and thus preserved civic hygiene.

<text>A sex scandal is a public scandal involving allegations or information about possibly immoral sexual activities, often associated with the sexual affairs of film stars, politicians, famous athletes, or others in the public eye. Sex scandals receive attention if a prominent figure is involved, if there is a perception of hypocrisy, if a public figure&#x27;s sexuality is non-normative, or if it involves non-consensual acts. A scandal may be based on reality, the product of false allegations, or a mixture of both. Whether the scandal is based in fact or not, it may lead to the celebrity disappearing from the public eye or to the resignation of prominent political figures.

Sex scandals involving politicians often become political scandals, particularly when there is an attempt at a cover-up or suspicions of illegality. Attempts at coverups include payoffs, threats, or, in extreme cases, murder. 

While some commentators see sex scandals as irrelevant to politics, particularly where &quot;professional performance [does] not seem to be impaired&quot;, Gene Healy of the Cato Institute views them as not just &quot;great fun&quot;, but a reminder that &quot;we should think twice before we cede more power to these fools&quot;. An increase in the prevalence of morally questionable expressions of sexuality is sometimes referred to as a &quot;sexidemic&quot;.

Sex scandals, in relation to political and public figures, often lead to questions of one&#x27;s own ethics and moral code. A politician who is caught in a sex scandal is more likely to resign than a public figure in the face of a sex scandal.

==History==
Scandals have been a part of history in major declarations, false truces, when political or celebrity figures need to pay someone off to protect their legacy and more. Scandals can involve bribery, immoral action, shame, slander, misdoing, etc. The Hamilton–Reynolds affair, which involved Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who had a one-year affair with Maria Reynolds during George Washington&#x27;s presidency, is considered one of the first sex scandals in American political history. Political sex scandals in the U.S. have included the first sex scandal of Alexander Hamilton to five major national political figures, Newt Gingrich, John Edwards, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.

==Infidelity==

Sex scandals involve sexual affairs which usually, but not always, involve infidelity. Infidelity has many definitions, either based on experience or research done on people who have been involved in the act of disloyalty and trust. To some, infidelity &quot;is a complex phenomenon with multiple reasons driving people to cheat on their partners&quot;. A 2018 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited an American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy national survey, stating &quot;that 15 percent of married women and 25 percent of married men have had extramarital affairs&quot;.

==Gender stereotypes in scandals==

Sex scandals tend to include a bias when it comes to men and women who are caught and then need evidence to explain their situation. A 2015 study concluded that gender stereotypes were &quot;refer(ed) to the meanings that individuals and societies ascribe to males and females&quot;. According to Juliet Williams at the University of California, Los Angeles the 1998 Clinton–Lewinsky scandal in the United States made the US Congress, media, and citizens look at male candidates and politicians in a different light by &quot;normalizing public discussion of sex acts.&quot; John Edwards, David Petraeus, Anthony Weiner, Arnold Schwarzenegger, are other examples of men involved in sex scandals that have caused the public not to give men the benefit of the doubt. This has caused the debate between politics and sex scandals to be seen in a different light. It has allowed gender-shifting and the role of gender to become more unbiased in the selection of candidates during their evaluation and allows more power for women fighting against stereotypes due to scandals, and men being seen as more skeptical.

A year after the 2017 Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases was first reported, leading to the viral spread of the #MeToo movement, &quot;New York Times&quot; published a list of 201 names of prominent men in the United States who had lost their jobs following public allegations of sexual harassment.

Social attitudes have traditionally been less forgiving when minors are involved. In France, for example, the scandal surrounding Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier and former call girl Zahia Dehar – for whom Bouvier allegedly acted as a pimp in the late 2000s, paying her to appear at dinners for entertainment when she was 17 years old – has caused outrage and opened a debate about powerful men in society abusing their power. The fall from grace and imprisonment of Anthony Weiner, following his sexting of explicit pictures to a 15-year-old girl, is another notable example of the pre-#MeToo era.

<text>A movie star (also known as a film star or cinema star) is an actor who is famous for their starring, or leading, roles in movies. The term is used for performers who are marketable stars as they become popular household names and whose names are used to promote movies, for example in trailers and posters. The most prominent movie stars are known in the industry as bankable stars.

==United States==

In the early days of silent movies, the names of the actors and actresses appearing in them were not publicized or credited because producers feared this would result in demands for higher salaries. However, audience curiosity soon undermined this policy. By 1909, actresses such as Florence Lawrence and Mary Pickford were already widely recognized, although the public remained unaware of their names. Lawrence was referred to as the “Biograph Girl” because she worked for D. W. Griffith&#x27;s Biograph Studios, while Pickford was &quot;Little Mary.&quot; In 1910, Lawrence switched to the Independent Moving Pictures Company, began appearing under her own name, and was hailed as &quot;America&#x27;s foremost moving picture star&quot; in IMP literature. Pickford began appearing under her own name in 1911.

The Independent Moving Pictures Company promoted their &quot;picture personalities&quot;, including Florence Lawrence and King Baggot, by giving them billing, credits and a marquee. Promotion in advertising led to the release of stories about these personalities to newspapers and fan magazines as part of a strategy to build brand loyalty for their company&#x27;s actors and films. By the 1920s, Hollywood film company promoters had developed a &quot;massive industrial enterprise&quot; that &quot;...peddled a new intangible—fame.&quot; Early Hollywood studios tightly controlled who was a movie star, as only they had the ability to place stars&#x27; names above the title; according to film historian Jeanine Basinger, this was done &quot;only for economic reasons&quot;.

Hollywood &quot;image makers&quot; and promotional agents planted rumors, selectively released real or fictitious biographical information to the press, and used other gimmicks to create glamorous personas for actors. Publicists thus &quot;created&quot; the &quot;enduring images&quot; and public perceptions of screen legends such as James Dean, Judy Garland, Rock Hudson, Marilyn Monroe, and Grace Kelly. The development of this &quot;star system&quot; made fame &quot;something that could be fabricated purposely, by the masters of the new &#x27;machinery of glory&#x27;.&quot; However, regardless of how &quot;...strenuously the star and their media handlers and press agents may ... try to &#x27;monitor&#x27; and &#x27;shape&#x27; it, the media and the public always play a substantial part in the image-making process.&quot; According to Madow, &quot;fame is a &#x27;relational&#x27; phenomenon, something that is conferred by others. A person can, within the limits of his natural talents, make himself strong or swift or learned. But he cannot, in this same sense, make himself famous, any more than he can make himself loved.&quot;

Madow goes on to point out &quot;fame is often conferred or withheld, just as love is, for reasons and on grounds other than &#x27;merit&#x27;.&quot; According to Sofia Johansson the &quot;canonical texts on stardom&quot; include articles by Boorstin (1971), Alberoni (1972) and Dyer (1979) that examined the &quot;representations of stars and on aspects of the Hollywood star system&quot;. Johansson writes that &quot;more recent analyses within media and cultural studies (e.g. Gamson 1994; Marshall 1997; Giles 2000; Turner, Marshall and Bonner 2000; Rojek 2001; Turner 2004) have instead dealt with the idea of a pervasive, contemporary, &#x27;celebrity culture&#x27;.&quot; In the analysis of the celebrity culture, &quot;fame and its constituencies are conceived of as a broader social process, connected to widespread economic, political, technological and cultural developments.&quot;

In the 1980s and 1990s, entertainment companies began using stars for a range of publicity tactics including press releases, movie junkets, and community activities. These promotional efforts are targeted and designed using market research, to increase the predictability of success of their media ventures. In some cases, publicity agents may create “provocative advertisements” or make an outrageous public statement to trigger public controversy and thereby generate &quot;free&quot; news coverage. Movie studios employed performers under long-term contracts. They developed a star system as a means of promoting and selling their movies. &quot;Star vehicles&quot; were filmed to display the particular talents and appeal of the most popular movie stars of the studio.

==Egypt==
Egypt&#x27;s famous movie stars in the 20th century include Youssef Wahbi, Fatima Rushdi, Leila Mourad, Anwar Wagdi, Naguib El-Rihani, Taheyya Kariokka, Ismail Yassine, Faten Hamama, Salah Zulfikar, Shadia, Soad Hosny, Shoukry Sarhan, Rushdy Abaza, Nadia Lutfi, Ahmed Mazhar, Sanaa Gamil, Ahmed Zaki, Nour El Sherif, Mervat Amin, Adel Emam, Naglaa Fathi, Yousra, Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, Hussein Fahmy, Sherihan, Mahmoud Yassin and Samir Ghanem.

==Asia==

Movie stars enjoy considerable prominence in Asia. In Asian film industries, many movies often run on the weight of the star&#x27;s crowd pulling power more than any other intrinsic aspect of film making.

===China===
A number of Chinese film actors have become some of the most popular movie stars in Eastern Asia, and several are also well known in the Western world. They include Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun-fat, Stephen Chow, Sammo Hung, Gong Li, Ziyi Zhang, Maggie Cheung, and the late Bruce Lee.

===India===
The Indian film industry consists of various regional cinema industries. One regional cinema, the Hindi film industry, commonly known as Bollywood, has its own set of rules in this respect. There are often superstars in this region who command premium pay commensurate with their box office appeal.

Some mainstream Indian movie stars, like the Khans of Bollywood (Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan,), Madhubala, Raj Kapoor, Nargis, Mithun Chakraborty, Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai gained international fame across Asia and Eastern Europe. For example, Bollywood films were popular in the Soviet Union, more so than Hollywood films and occasionally even domestic Soviet films. Indian actors like Raj Kapoor, Nargis and Mithun Chakroborty were household names in the Soviet Union, with films such as &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951) and &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; (1982) drawing more than 60 million viewers in the country. The Hindi film actors Raj Kapoor and Aamir Khan also became very popular in China, with films such as &quot;Awaara&quot;, &quot;3 Idiots&quot; (2009), and &quot;Dangal&quot; (2016), one of the top 20 highest-grossing films in China.

<text>Thomas Wright (23 April 181023 December 1877) was an English writer, scholar, and antiquarian. He was a prolific writer and an editor of medieval texts. He was also one of the founding members of the British Archaeological Association, which remains active to this day.

==Life==
Wright was born near Ludlow at Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire descended from a Quaker family formerly living at Bradford. He was educated at Ludlow Grammar School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, whence he graduated in 1834.
While at Cambridge he contributed to the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and other periodicals, and in 1835 he came to London to devote himself to a literary career.

His first separate work was &quot;Early English Poetry in Black Letter, with Prefaces and Notes&quot; (4 vols, 1836), which was followed over the next forty years by an extensive series of publications, many of lasting value. He helped to found the British Archaeological Association and the Percy, Camden and Shakespeare Societies. In 1842 he was elected corresponding member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres of Paris, and was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries as well as member of many other learned British and foreign bodies.

In 1859, he superintended the excavations of the Roman town of Viroconium Cornoviorum (Wroxeter), near Shrewsbury, and issued a report.
A portrait of him is in the &quot;Drawing Room Portrait Gallery&quot; for 1 October 1859.

English priest and historical writer, Thomas Edward Bridgett observed, &quot;It is only when he has to speak of the Catholic Church that he is bitter and unfair.&quot;

He died aged 67 in Chelsea, London, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery.

The district was created in 1938 as the successor of the &quot;Oberamt Freudenstadt&quot; which dated back to 1806. In 1973 it was merged with the majority of the neighboring district of Horb, and some small parts of the districts of Wolfach and Hechingen.

==Geography==
The district is located in the middle part of the Black Forest mountains. The river Neckar flows through the southeast of the district.

<doc id="235229" wikidata="Q3787461" url="?curid=235229" title="Hughie Green">
<text>Hugh Hughes Green OStJ (2 February 1920 – 3 May 1997) was an English radio and television presenter, game show host and actor.

==Early life==
Green was born in Marylebone, London, to a Scottish father, Hugh Aitchison Green, a former British Army officer from Glasgow who made his fortune supplying canned fish to the Allied forces in the First World War, and an English mother, Violet Elenore (née Price), from Surrey, the daughter of an Irish gardener. The family had a home in Meopham, Kent, where the children lived with their mother, who took frequent lovers, while their father did business from the Savoy Hotel, and often stayed there. Green attended Arnold House School, a boys&#x27; prep school, in the St John&#x27;s Wood district of Westminster, Greater London.

==Career==

===Child performer===
After the family business went bankrupt, Green&#x27;s father encouraged his stage-obsessed son into performance, and by the age of 14, Hughie Green had his own BBC Radio show and created and toured with his own all-children cast concert party called &quot;Hughie Green and his Gang&quot;. After an extensive tour of Canada, in 1935 Green appeared in his first film, &quot;Midshipman Easy&quot;, then went to Hollywood, California, where he appeared in the film &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; and at the Cocoanut Grove with his cabaret act.

===Second World War===
Having already fathered his first illegitimate child with a Birmingham usherette, at the age of 17 and having been caught in North America on the declaration of war, during the Second World War Green served as a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force, ferrying aircraft across the Atlantic with RAF Ferry Command. In 1942, he married Montreal society beauty Claire Wilson, and went on to work in the aircraft industry as a ferry transport pilot and stunt pilot. From 1947, when he returned to London, he was involved in business activities that included selling aircraft.

===Radio presenter===
In 1949, Green devised a talent show called &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;, which was commissioned by BBC Radio. The show lasted for only one series, and Green was apparently told it was &quot;too American&quot; for the British audience. After the show was cancelled, Green sued the BBC, Carroll Levis, and six friends and family of Levis, alleging a conspiracy to keep his &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; show off the air to preserve Levis&#x27;s rival show, &quot;Discoveries&quot;. The case came to trial at the High Court in May 1955, with Green represented by Viscount Hailsham. The trial lasted for twenty days, but on 27 May, after a retirement of only 20 minutes, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants. As a result of the costs in the case, Green&#x27;s creditors filed a petition for his bankruptcy, and a receiving order was made on 8 May 1956. He was not discharged from bankruptcy until 18 June 1958.

===Mainstream popularity===
Green became a household name in 1955, with the ITV quiz show &quot;Double Your Money, &quot;which had actually originated some years earlier on Radio Luxembourg. Green brought his future co-host Monica Rose to the screen. Rose, a chirpy 15-year-old Cockney junior accounts clerk, had won £8 answering questions on famous women and was invited back by Green to be a hostess.

On 8 November 1966, Hughie Green presented the show from &quot;The House of Friendship&quot; in Moscow. Along with Monica Rose, he also had Natasha Vasylyeva as assistant. Because the Communist Party would not allow money as a prize, the top prize was a television set.

Green&#x27;s most successful show format was his self-developed long-running talent show, &quot;Opportunity Knocks.&quot; It started as a UK-wide touring show produced for the radio, and one of Green&#x27;s early finds was singer Frankie Vaughan, who came second as part of a duet. When the show transferred to television on the ITV network, first in 1956 and then again from 1964, it began the show-business careers of Les Dawson, Lena Zavaroni, Pam Ayres, and Mary Hopkin, among others. Green, who possessed a pilot&#x27;s licence, would fly the panel of judges between audition venues all over Britain, in his small Cessna aircraft.

His game show &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; was generally considered a failure, and was dropped by most ITV regional companies after the first run, although it lasted until 1974 in the Yorkshire and Granada regions, eventually being cancelled because of low ratings, combined with a falling-out between Green and producer Jess Yates.

Right up until its final shows, &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; was a ratings hit that attracted up to 18 million viewers weekly. However, Green, known for his right-wing politics, had decided he was bigger than the show format he had devised, and began politicising an apolitical family-friendly format. It has been suggested that Green believed that Harold Wilson and his Labour government were communists, that Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, should replace Wilson as leader of the country and, to that end, he used &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; as an end-of-year soapbox, telling the country at the end of 1974 to &#x27;wake up!&#x27; Two years later, in December 1976, Green recited a monologue about the state of the United Kingdom, followed by a choir singing &quot;Stand Up and Be Counted&quot;, with the words coming up in subtitles: &quot;Stand up and be counted, where the managers manage and the workers don&#x27;t go on strike&quot;. It was released as a single in 1977, and partly seen as an open gesture of support for Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher; he was disciplined by Thames Television, but continued to make political comments. After numerous viewer complaints, Thames axed the show in March 1978, despite it attracting high ratings, something Green mentioned in a bitter rant against Thames in his last show. The family-friendly &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; was replaced by the youth-orientated comedy series &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show,&quot; which attracted 10 million viewers, although it never achieved the ratings of &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;.

After his rather slow-paced and &quot;end of the pier&quot; entertainment-style shows were replaced with more active audience participation formats, Green tried presenting variants on the &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; theme in Ireland, Australia and in the USSR.

==Style==
Green was often mocked for his permanent door-to-door salesman&#x27;s smile and Canadian accent. His catchphrase &quot;I mean that most sincerely&quot; was also mocked, to such an extent that it is sometimes mistakenly believed to have been invented by the impressionist Mike Yarwood, who was known for his impersonation of Green. In a 1992 TV interview, Green told Phillip Schofield that he had come up with the catchphrase himself.
During &quot;Double Your Money&quot;, Green kept up an occasional but good-natured feud with quiz show host Michael Miles, who hosted &quot;Take Your Pick.&quot; Miles even appeared on one occasion with a huge bouquet of flowers for a guest, to Green&#x27;s mock indignation.

==Recordings==
Green made a number of recordings. As a solo act he released singles on the Parlophone, Decca, Columbia, EMI and Philips labels. He also recorded an album, &quot;Songs For Children&quot; which was released on York Records MYK 601 in 1971.

==Personal life==
Green met Montreal socialite Claire Wilson on a cruise liner in the mid-1930s when both were still teenagers. They married in 1942 and settled in Montreal, before moving to London in 1947. The couple had two children. The family lived in a fifth-floor flat in Baker Street, London, although with Green&#x27;s numerous affairs and self-obsession, including taking luxury holidays and often spending Christmas on his own, his children defined it as &quot;highly dysfunctional&quot;.

The Greens separated in 1961 and filed for divorce in March 1975, after Green started an affair with Gwen Claremont, the sister of an earlier lover, Pat. Later that year, Claire married &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; actor David Langton. After the separation from his wife, Green&#x27;s drinking became more compulsive, while his affairs continued, even during the height of his fame presenting &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. Journalist Noel Botham approached Green to expose him, but Green countered with a lawsuit threat. Eventually, the two became friends.

Botham then became key in two stories in Green&#x27;s life. Green grew frustrated by Yorkshire Television&#x27;s failure to remove programme producer Jess Yates when he requested this to be done, and so leaked to Botham the stories of Yates&#x27; affair with the young actress Anita Kay, whose story, published in the &quot;News of the World&quot;, destroyed Yates&#x27; career. In May 1997, shortly after Green&#x27;s death, Botham wrote the exposé story, also in the &quot;News of the World&quot;, of Green being the biological father of Jess Yates&#x27; daughter, TV presenter Paula Yates, something she read when the tabloids printed the story, and which was later confirmed with a DNA test result in December 1997.

Through his daughter Paula Yates, Green had four other granddaughters whom he never knew: Fifi, Peaches and Pixie Geldof, fathered by Bob Geldof; and Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof, fathered by Michael Hutchence and legally adopted by Bob Geldof in 2007.

Green&#x27;s final partner for the last five years of his life was Christina Sharples, widow of his long-term musical director Bob Sharples, who had died in 1987.

==Death==

In 1983, Green sued the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, claiming its 1975–78 version of &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; infringed his copyright. He lost and in 1989 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council rejected his appeal, leaving him a £250,000 legal bill.

In July 1993, after a lifetime of smoking a pipe, heavy drinking and latterly taking recreational barbiturates, Green was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, and admitted to the Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea, London. By 1997, the cancer had spread to his lungs. Green died in hospital on Saturday 3 May 1997, aged 77.

His memorial at Golders Green Crematorium reads: &quot;You were the star that made opportunity knock. You will never be forgotten&quot;.

==Legacy==
In light of the death in 2000 of his daughter Paula Yates, his son Christopher Green, wrote the biographical perspective &quot;Hughie and Paula: The Tangled Lives of Hughie Green and Paula Yates.&quot;

On 2 April 2008 a TV film about Green&#x27;s life was broadcast on BBC Four. In the film, entitled &quot;Hughie Green, Most Sincerely&quot;, Trevor Eve was cast in the lead role. In &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; of 3 February 2008, his daughter Linda Plentl said the new BBC drama about her father would reopen intolerable wounds. She told of her struggle with his legacy and her three meetings with half-sister Paula Yates.

<text>In politics, a political scandal is an action or event regarded as morally or legally wrong and causing general public outrage. Politicians, government officials, party officials and lobbyists can be accused of various illegal, corrupt, unethical or sexual practices. Politicians and officials who are embroiled in scandals are more likely to retire or get lower vote shares.

==Journalism ==
Scandal sells, and broadsides, pamphlets, newspapers, magazines and the electronic media have covered it in depth. The Muckraker movement in American journalism was a component of the Progressive Era in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Journalists have built their careers on exposure of corruption and political scandal, often acting on behalf of the opposition party.
The political ideology of media owners plays a role—they prefer to target the opposition but will reluctantly cover their own side. Journalists have to frame the story in terms of the audience&#x27;s values and expectations to maximize the impact.

<text>The Raggy Dolls is a 1986-1994 British cartoon series which originally aired on ITV. The series is set in Mr Grimes&#x27; Toy Factory, where imperfect dolls are thrown into a reject bin. While unobserved by human eyes, the dolls come to life and climb out of the reject bin to have adventures. The series was designed to encourage children to think positively about physical disabilities. 112 episodes were produced.

== Production history ==
The series was produced for Yorkshire Television from 3 April 1986 to 20 December 1994. It was created by Melvyn Jacobson, with scripts, narration, and music by Neil Innes. Yorkshire Television produced the first two series of &quot;The Raggy Dolls&quot; before awarding the commission to Orchid Productions Limited in 1987.

This was the first programme Yorkshire Television commissioned from an independent production company. Orchid Productions went on to produce over 100 more episodes of the series. The initial animator for Yorkshire TV was Roy Evans. After the move to Orchid Productions Mark Mason took over the role, animating and storyboarding 26 episodes, and storyboarding and directing other animators on a further 26 episodes before moving on to work on other children&#x27;s shows.

He was replaced by Peter Hale from the 7th series onwards. The series was sold abroad to a number of other countries.

==Characters ==

===The Raggy Dolls===

*Sad Sack – A sample of a design that was deemed too expensive to mass-produce; his appearance is somewhat different from that of the others. He is the oldest of the seven Raggy Dolls in the Reject Bin. As his name suggests, he is very gloomy and cynical, but he still values his friendship with the other dolls.
*Dotty - As the oldest next to the lethargic Sad Sack, she sees herself as the leader of the group and is often very bossy. She is so named because she accidentally had paint spilt on her hair and clothing. Dotty&#x27;s main catchphrase is: &quot;Good thinking!&quot;
*Hi-Fi – He converses with stammer due to him being dropped during testing. It was also stated in the episode &quot;The Trouble with Claude&quot; that he was wired incorrectly, hence the stammer. He always wears headphones, which allow him to tune into radio and communication signals from seemingly any source.
*Lucy – Her limbs are inadequately attached with nylon thread. She is shy and easily frightened, but always kind-hearted and loyal to her friends. She can be brave on occasion, as first seen in the episode &quot;Ghosts&quot;. She speaks with a Derbyshire accent.
*Back-To-Front – He is a handyman doll with a backward-facing head (as a result of the manufacturer putting his head on the wrong way round) and a love of machines. Always calm in a crisis, Back-To-Front&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;No problem!&quot;.
*Claude – A French doll, who, unlike his companions, is actually perfect in every way. He fell out of a box of dolls being shipped to France and was left behind, being put in the bin out of a lack of other places. He speaks with a French accent and sometimes alternates between speaking English and French. He also has a notable talent for cooking.
*Princess – She should have been a beautiful princess doll, but the machine accidentally cut her hair and left her dress in rags. In the manner of a typical aristocrat, her voice is characterised by H-adding. As the opening titles indicate, Princess is the youngest of the original seven Raggy Dolls.
*Ragamuffin – A wandering traveller doll who had lost his owner and decided to spend his life taking in new sights and experiences. Introduced in the fifth series.

===Friends===
*Pumpernickle – A Scarecrow who is a friend to the Raggy Dolls.
*Edward – Mr Grimes&#x27;s lost teddy bear who becomes a good friend to the Raggy Dolls.
*Mr Marmalade – Mr Grimes&#x27;s pet cat who has a playful trait.
*Hercules – An old farmhorse.
*Rupert the Roo – An Australian toy kangaroo who had been mailed from Australia until he had become a new friend to the Raggy Dolls.
*Natasha – A Russian Doll bought by Mrs Grimes.

===Humans===
*Mr Oswald &quot;Ozzie&quot; Grimes – The owner of the toy factory.
*Cynthia – Appeared later in the series to be Mr Grimes&#x27;s love interest, and later wife.
*Florrie Fosdyke – The kind but forgetful canteen manager of the factory.
*Farmer Brown – The farmer of One Pin Farm.
*Ethel Grimes – Mr Grimes&#x27;s sister.
*Old Mrs Grimes - Mr Grimes and Ethel&#x27;s Mother
* Oz and Boz – Ethel&#x27;s badly-behaved sons (and Mr Grimes&#x27;s nephews), known as the Terrible Twins.

<doc id="235232" wikidata="Q63340" url="?curid=235232" title="Christian August Crusius">
<text>Christian August Crusius (10 January 1715 – 18 October 1775) was a German philosopher and Protestant theologian.

==Biography==
Crusius was born in Leuna in the Electorate of Saxony. He was educated at the University of Leipzig, and became professor of theology there in 1750, and principal in 1773.

Crusius first came to notice as an opponent of the philosophy of Gottfried Leibniz and Christian Wolff from the standpoint of religious orthodoxy. He attacked it mainly on the grounds of the moral evils that must flow from any system of determinism, and attempted to vindicate the freedom of the will. The most important works of this period of his life are &quot;Anweisung, vernünftig zu leben&quot; [Guide to Rational Living] (1744), &quot;Entwurf der nothwendigen Vernunftwahrheiten wiefern sie den zufälligen entgegengesetzt werden&quot; [Outline of the Necessary Truths of Reason, in so far as they are Opposed to Contingent Truths] (1745), &quot;Weg zur Gewissheit und Zuverlässigkeit der menschlichen Erkenntniss&quot; [Path to Certainty and Reliability in Human Knowledge] (1747), and &quot;Anleitung, über natürliche Begebenheiten ordentlich und vorsichtig nachzudenken&quot; [Instruction on How to Reflect Correctly and Cautiously on Natural Events] (1749). Crusius&#x27; philosophical books had a great but short-lived popularity. His criticism of Wolff influenced Immanuel Kant at the time when his system was forming; and his ethical, as well as epistemological, doctrines are cited in his habilitation thesis and the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;. Kant was both &quot;deeply influenced by Crusius&quot; and also explicitly refuted Crusius&#x27; characterization of Spirit in a footnote of his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics: &quot;Crusius alone thought of a compromise: that a Spirit, who can neither err nor deceive, implanted these laws in us originally. But since false principles often intrude themselves, as indeed the very system of this man shows in not a few examples, we are involved in difficulties as to the use of such a principle in the absence of sure criteria to distinguish the genuine origin from the spurious, as we never can know certainly what the Spirit of truth or the father of lies may have instilled into us.&quot; Kant also owned &quot;Anweisung&quot;, &quot;Entwurf&quot;, and &quot;Anleitung.&quot;

Crusius&#x27;s later life was devoted to theology. He led the party in the university which became known as the &quot;Crusianer&quot; as opposed to the &quot;Ernestianer,&quot; the followers of Johann August Ernesti. The two professors adopted opposite methods of exegesis. Ernesti wished to subject the Scripture in the same way as other ancient books; Crusius held firmly to orthodox ecclesiastical tradition.

He died in Leipzig.

==Philosophical work==
Crusius&#x27;s chief theological works are &quot;Hypomnemata ad theologiam propheticam&quot; (1764–78), and &quot;Kurzer Entwurf den Moraltheologie&quot; (&quot;Short Outline of Moral Theology&quot;; 1772–73); his most important philosophical work is &quot;Entwurf der notwendingen Venunftwahrheiten&quot; reprinted Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1963. He opposed innovation in such matters as the accepted authorship of canonical writings, verbal inspiration, and the treatment of persons and events in the Old Testament as types of the New. His views have influenced later evangelical students of the Old Testament, such as Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg and Franz Delitzsch.

There is a full notice of Crusius in Ersch and Gruber&#x27;s &quot;Allgemeine Encyclopädie&quot;. See also Johann Eduard Erdmann&#x27;s &quot;History of Philosophy&quot;; Anton Marquardt, &quot;Kant und Crusius&quot;; and article in Herzog-Hauck, &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot; (1898).

<text>The Georgian Jews (, ) are a community of Jews who migrated to Georgia during the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE. It is one of the oldest communities in the region. They are also widely distinguished from the Ashkenazi Jews in Georgia, who arrived following the Russian annexation of Georgia.

Prior to Georgia&#x27;s annexation by the Russian Empire in 1801, the 2300-year history of the Georgian Jews was marked by an almost total absence of antisemitism and a visible assimilation in the Georgian language and culture. The Georgian Jews were considered ethnically and culturally distinct from neighboring Mountain Jews.

As a result of a major emigration wave in the 1990s, the vast majority of Georgian Jews now live in Israel, with the world&#x27;s largest community living in the city of Ashdod.

==History==
The Georgian Jews traditionally lived separately, not only from the surrounding Georgian people, but also from the Ashkenazi Jews in Tbilisi, who had different practices and language.

The community, which numbered almost 60,000 as recently as the 1970s, has largely emigrated to Israel, the United States, the Russian Federation and Belgium (in Antwerp). , only about 1,500 Georgian Jews remained in Georgia. According to the 2002 First General National Census of Georgia, there are 3,541 Jewish believers in the country. For example, the Lezgishvili branch of Georgian Jews have families in Israel, Moscow, Baku, Düsseldorf, and Cleveland, Ohio (US). Several hundred Georgian Jewish families live in the New York tri-state area, particularly in New York City and Long Island.

===Origins===
Georgian-speaking Jewry is one of the oldest surviving Jewish communities in the world. The Georgian Jews have an approximately 2,600-year history in Colchis. The origin of Georgian Jews, also known as &quot;Gurjim&quot; or &quot;kartveli ebraelebi&quot;, is debated. The most popular view is that the first Jews made their way to southern Georgia after Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE and exile in Babylon. This claim is supported by the medieval Georgian historical account by Leonti Mroveli, who writes:

Mroveli added that a further settlement of the Jews in Georgia was during the Roman period of Emperor Vespasian. He wrote that Jews lived in Georgia long before 1st century CE. According to Mroveli:

The ancient Georgian historic chronicle, &quot;The Conversion of Kartli&quot;, is the oldest and only Georgian source concerning the history of the Jewish community in Georgia. The chronicle describes a version similar to that offered centuries later by Leonti Mroveli, but the period of Jewish migration into Georgia is ascribed to Alexander the Great:


Georgian sources also refer to the arrival of the first Jews in Western Georgia from the Byzantine Empire during the 6th century CE. Approximately 3,000 of the Jews fled to Eastern Georgia, which by that time was controlled by the Persians, to escape severe persecution by the Byzantines. The existence of the Jews in these regions during this period is supported by the archaeological evidence, which shows that Jews lived in Mtskheta, the ancient capital of the Eastern Georgian state of Iberia-Kartli.

According to the Georgian hagiography, Jewish communities existed in Georgia in the 1st century. A Georgian Jew called Elias was said to be in Jerusalem during the Crucifixion and brought Jesus&#x27; robe back with him to Georgia. He had acquired it from a Roman soldier at Golgotha.

The Jews spoke Georgian, and later Jewish traders developed a dialect called &quot;Kivruli&quot;, or Judaeo-Georgian, which included a number of Hebrew words.

In the second half of the 7th century, the Muslim Empire conquered extensive Georgian territory, which became a province of the Arab caliphate. Arab emirs ruled in the Georgian capital Tbilisi and surrounding territory for nearly 500 years, until 1122.

Genetic studies carried out on Georgian Jews as part of a wider survey showed close genetic links with other Jews, and in particular with Iraqi and Persian Jews. This seemed to prove the historical accounts of Jewish migration from Persia into Georgia.

===Middle Ages===
There is not much documentation about Georgian Jews under the Arab domination. In the late 9th century, Abu-Imran Musa al-Za&#x27;farani (later known as Abu-Imran al-Tiflisi) founded a Jewish Karai sect called the Tiflis Sect (&quot;Tiflisites&quot;), which lasted for more than 300 years. The sect deviated from Rabbinic &quot;halakhah&quot; in its marriage and &quot;kashrut&quot; customs. This sect did not represent the great majority of Georgian Jews, who adhered to traditional Rabbinic Judaism while maintaining strong religious ties with Baghdad and other Jews of Iraq. The nature of Georgian Jew&#x27;s observance to rabbinic law was also noted by Benjamin of Tudela and Abraham ben David (also known as the RABAD or RAVAD).

===Annexation of Georgia by the Russian Empire===

===Anti-Semitism under the Tsarist government===

The tradition of the relationship between Jews and other Georgians has no signs of anti-Semitism, excluding the Tsarist government. For many centuries, the Church in Georgia did not incite against the Jews, and the Georgian Jews were visibly assimilated in the country&#x27;s rural life and culture.

===Revolution and independence===


===Contemporary Georgia===

After the Six-Day War, huge numbers of Soviet Jews began protesting for the right to immigrate to Israel, and many applied for exit visas. Georgian Jews made up a large percentage of this number.

While most Soviet Jewish emigration was individual, Georgian-Jewish emigration was communal. Due to Georgian-Jewish traditions of strong, extended families and the strict, patriarchal nature of Georgian families, Georgians immigrated as whole communities, with emigration of individuals causing a chain reaction leading to more emigration, and brought their community structures with them. For example, nearly the entire population of at least two Georgian towns made aliyah. At the time the emigration started, Israel had a policy of scattering the population around the country, and was experiencing a housing shortage, with the result that Georgians were assigned housing in different parts of the country. The Georgians began demanding that they be concentrated together, and the crisis reached a fever pitch when several families threatened to return to Georgia, and new immigrants, forewarned by predecessors, began demanding to be placed in specific areas upon arrival. Although Prime Minister Golda Meir criticized the Georgians&#x27; desire to &quot;isolate themselves into ghettos&quot;, the Israeli Immigrant Absorption Ministry eventually bowed to their demands, and began to create concentrations of around 200 families in twelve areas of the country.

In Israel, Georgian immigrants successfully integrated into society, but faced certain problems. Georgian immigrants were usually able to find jobs with ease, and often worked in light industry jobs, such as dock workers, porters, and construction workers, but faced certain issues. One major issue was religion; the Georgian Jews were often devout and had fiercely clung to their traditions in the Soviet Union, and were stunned to discover that Israeli Jews were mostly secular. As a result, Georgian immigrants demanded their own separate synagogues to continue their unique religious traditions, which the government agreed to, and enrolled their children in religious schools rather than regular schools.

Many Georgian Jews now live in Israel, estimated at around 75,000 people.
In Israel, most Georgian Jews settled near the coast in cities such as Lod, Bat Yam, Ashdod, and Holon. There are Georgian Jews in Jerusalem as well, with several prominent synagogues.

===Independence and Georgia today===
As a result of the 2008 South Ossetia War, some 200 Georgian Jews immigrated to Israel with assistance from the Jewish Agency.

==Demographics==
According to the 1897 Russian Empire Census, there were 12,194 people whose native language was &quot;Jewish&quot; in the two provinces that largely covered today&#x27;s Georgia: Tiflis Governorate (5,188) and Kutais Governorate (7,006). There were 3,419 Jews in Kutaisi city (10.5% of the population), 2,935 in Tiflis, 1,064 in Batumi.

Georgia&#x27;s population almost doubled between 1926 and 1970, then began declining, with dramatic declines in the 1970s and 1990s, when many Georgian Jews left and moved to other countries, especially to Israel.
==Language==
The traditional language of the Georgian Jews is Judaeo-Georgian, a variant of Georgian, characterized by a large number of Hebrew loanwords, and written using either the Georgian alphabet or Hebrew alphabet. Besides speaking Judaeo-Georgian, the Georgian Jews speak the languages of the peoples surrounding them. In Georgia, these include Georgian and Russian; in Belgium, Dutch; in the United States and Canada English; and in Israel, Modern Hebrew.

<text>This is a list of the highest known prices paid for paintings. The record is approximately US$450.3 million (which includes commission), paid for Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; (). The painting was sold in November 2017, through the auction house Christie&#x27;s in New York City.

==Background==
The most famous paintings, especially old master works created before 1803, are generally owned or held by museums for viewing by patrons. Since museums rarely sell them, they are considered priceless. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; lists Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; as having the highest insurance value for a painting. On permanent display at the Louvre in Paris, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was assessed at US$100 million on 14 December 1962. Taking inflation into account, the 1962 value would be around US$ million in .

The earliest sale on the list below (&quot;Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers&quot; by Vincent van Gogh) is from March 1987; with a price of £24.75 million (£ million in currency). This sale tripled the previous record, and introduced a new era in top art sales. Before this, the highest absolute price paid for a painting was £8.1 million (£ million in currency) paid by the J. Paul Getty Museum for Andrea Mantegna&#x27;s &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; at Christie&#x27;s in London on 18 April 1985. The sale of Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Sunflowers&quot; was the first time a &quot;modern&quot; (in this case 1888) painting became the record holder. Old master paintings had previously dominated the market. In contrast, there are currently only nine pre-1875 paintings among the listed top 89, and none created between 1635 and 1874.

An exceptional case is graffiti artist David Choe, who accepted payment in shares for painting graffiti art in the headquarters of a fledgling Facebook. His shares were of limited value when he was given them, but by the time of Facebook&#x27;s IPO they were valued at around $200 million.

The list is incomplete with respect to sales between private parties, as these are not always reported and, even if they are, details like the purchase price may remain secret. For example, on June 25, 2019, the American hedge fund manager J. Tomilson Hill bought a recently rediscovered &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot; (1607) attributed to Caravaggio, two days before it would have been auctioned in Toulouse. Though the Louvre Museum had turned down the opportunity to purchase it for €100 million, the painting was estimated to sell for $110 to $170 million. The actual purchase price was not disclosed, because of a confidentiality agreement attached to the private sale. Another example is a 2019 sale of &quot;The Seated Zouave&quot; by Vincent van Gogh. According to some sources, the painting had been sold by Argentine art collector Nelly Arrieta de Blaquier for $300 million, but the price was not confirmed by any of the parties involved.

Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Andy Warhol are the best-represented artists in the list. Whereas Picasso and Warhol became wealthy men, van Gogh is known to have sold only one painting in his lifetime, &quot;The Red Vineyard&quot;, for (approximately $2,000 in 2018 dollars) in 1890, to the Belgian impressionist painter and heiress Anna Boch. 

Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe holds the record for the highest price paid for a painting by a woman. On November 20, 2014 at Sotheby&#x27;s, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art bought her 1932 painting &quot;Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1&quot; for US$44.4 million (equivalent to US$ million in ).

Among the listed top 89, only six are paintings by non-Western artists. Five are traditional Chinese paintings by Qi Baishi, Wu Bin, Wang Meng and Xu Yang. In particular, Qi Baishi&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Landscape Screens&quot; was sold for $140.8 million in 2017. The only non-Western modern artwork listed is that of the Chinese-French painter Zao Wouki&#x27;s oil painting &quot;Juin-Octobre 1985&quot;, which was sold for $65 million in 2018. Not listed here in this list is Chinese painter Wang Shaofei&#x27;s &quot;The High Sun&quot;, which was appraised for $74 million in 2017.

==List of highest prices paid ==

This list is ordered by consumer price index inflation-adjusted value (in bold) in millions of United States dollars in . Where necessary, the price is first converted to dollars using the exchange rate at the time the painting was sold. The inflation adjustment may change as recent inflation rates are often revised. A list in another currency may be in a slightly different order due to exchange-rate fluctuations. Paintings are listed only once, i.e., for the highest price sold.

<text>Avianus (or possibly Avienus; c. AD 400) a Latin writer of fables, identified as a Greco-Roman Polytheist.

The 42 fables which bear his name are dedicated to a certain Theodosius, whose learning is spoken of in most flattering terms. He may possibly be Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius, the author of &quot;Saturnalia&quot;; some think he may be the emperor of that name. Nearly all the fables are to be found in Babrius, who was probably Avianus&#x27;s source of inspiration, but as Babrius wrote in Greek, and Avianus speaks of having made an elegiac version from a rough Latin copy, probably a prose paraphrase, he was not indebted to the original. The language and metre are on the whole correct, in spite of deviations from classical usage, chiefly in the management of the pentameter. The fables soon became popular as a school-book. &quot;Promythia and epimythia&quot; (introductions and morals), paraphrases, and imitations were frequent, such as the &quot;Novus Avianus&quot; of Alexander Neckam (12th century).

<text>Robinson Ellis, FBA (5 September 1834 – 9 October 1913) was an English classical scholar.

== Biography ==
Ellis was born at Barming, near Maidstone, and was educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, Rugby School, and Balliol College, Oxford. He took a First in Classical Moderations in 1854 and a First in Literae Humaniores (&#x27;Greats&#x27;) in 1856. In 1858 he became fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and in 1870 professor of Latin at University College London. In 1876 he returned to Oxford, where from 1883 to 1893 he held the university readership in Latin. In 1893 he succeeded Henry Nettleship as Corpus Professor of Latin.

His chief work was on Catullus, whom he began to study in 1859. In the course of his research he used an important early manuscript of Catullus, named the &quot;Codex Oxoniensis&quot; (many sources credit him with a discovery here, but that exact codex is already mentioned in an edition of Catullus made by Friedrich Wilhelm Doering in 1822). However, Ellis did not recognise the importance of that codex, and failed to consult it for his &quot;Commentary on Catullus&quot; (1876), thereby attracting criticism (Emil Baehrens first recognised the importance of the Oxoniensis and published his conclusions two years earlier, in 1874). In 1889 Ellis produced a second, enlarged edition, which resulted its author&#x27;s recognition as an authority on Catullus. Professor Ellis quoted largely from the early Italian commentators, maintaining that the land where the Renaissance originated had done more for scholarship than is commonly recognized. He supplemented his critical work by a translation (1871, dedicated to Alfred Tennyson), &quot;The Poems and Fragments of Catullus in the Metres of the Original&quot;.

Another author to whom Professor Ellis devoted many years&#x27; study was Manilius, the astrological poet. In 1891 he published &quot;Noctes Manilianae&quot;, a series of dissertations on the &quot;Astronomica&quot;, with emendations. He also treated Avianus, Velleius Paterculus and the Christian poet Orientius, whose poem &quot;Commonitorium&quot; he edited for the &quot;Vienna Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum&quot;. He edited the &quot;Ibis&quot; of Ovid, the &quot;Aetna&quot; of the younger Lucilius, and contributed to the &quot;Anecdota Oxoniensia&quot; various unedited Bodleian and other manuscripts. In 1907 he published &quot;Appendix Vergiliana&quot; (an edition of the minor poems); in 1908 &quot;The Annalist Licinianus&quot;.

He is buried in St Sepulchre&#x27;s Cemetery, Jericho, Oxford.

<text>Granius Licinianus (active in the 2nd century AD) was a Roman author of historical and encyclopedic works that survive only in fragments. He most likely lived at the time of Hadrian.

==History==
Granius compiled a &quot;novel&quot; narrative epitome of Roman history, drawing mainly on Livy and Sallust, that ran to at least 36 books, &quot;keen on anecdotes and curious details.&quot; That he had his own views on historiography should not be doubted: in his opinion, Sallust ought not to be read as an historian at all, but as an orator. Granius covered the history of Rome from the early times at least to the death of Julius Caesar; the assumption of this as an end-point of his history has sometimes caused him to be identified with Granius Flaccus and his life to be dated to the 1st century BC. Though riddled with &quot;lacunae,&quot; Granius&#x27;s Book 35 presents one of the most informative accounts of the siege of Rome during the civil war of 87 BC, and his history regularly provides illuminative details that complement more complete histories. Some fragments of the books relating to the years 163-78 BC are preserved in a manuscript which was discovered in 1853 and survives as a double &quot;palimpsest,&quot; that is, a 5th-century copy was overwritten in the 6th century with a Latin grammatical treatise and again in the 11th century with a Syriac translation of John Chrysostom&#x27;s sermons. (Add. 17212)

Granius also wrote &quot;Cenae Suae&quot; (&quot;My Dinner Parties&quot;), an encyclopedic work that displayed his antiquarian interests in the manner of Aulus Gellius and his &quot;Attic Nights&quot;.

<text>&lt;mapframe text=&quot;Current map of Fleet&quot; width=282 height=282 zoom=13 latitude=51.2834 longitude=-0.8456 /&gt;

Fleet is a town and civil parish in the Hart District of Hampshire, England, centred south-west of London and east of Basingstoke. 

It is the largest town of the Hart District, and has many large technology business areas, fast rail links to London, and is well connected to the M3. The Fleet built-up area has a total population of 45,218, and includes the contiguous parishes of Church Crookham, Crookham Village, Dogmersfield, and Elvetham Heath. The town has a prominent golf club, an annual half marathon, an athletics club, and four football clubs. The nearby service station on the motorway is named after the town.

Local landmarks include Fleet Pond, the largest freshwater lake in Hampshire, and a High Street with many Victorian and Edwardian buildings. Fleet holds a weekly Saturday market in Gurkha Square.

==Geography==
This north-east corner of Hampshire had shallow and sandy, slightly acidic soil, much of it boggy or covered in gorse and bracken (see Bagshot Formation). It held little use for agriculture compared to the long-grazed chalk lands and belts of alluvial areas of the rest of the county. The Fleet area has yielded few archaeological finds.
Isaac Taylor&#x27;s Map of Hampshire (1759) shows three small habitations in the area that was later to become Fleet.

Areas and suburbs of Fleet town are Pondtail, Ancells Park and Elvetham Heath. The villages of Crookham Village and Church Crookham are contiguous with the town. Immediately surrounding towns and villages include Winchfield, Dogmersfield, Crondall, Ewshot, and Hartley Wintney.

The Fleet Pond nature reserve is a beauty spot on the northern edge of the town. Fleet Pond is the largest freshwater lake in Hampshire. Being very shallow, Fleet Pond is actively managed and needs regular dredging to avoid it silting up. In times past, the lake has frozen over, permitting skating.

===Climate===
Being located in South East England, Fleet has a temperate climate which is generally drier and warmer than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between . July is the warmest month in the area with average daily maxima around . Rainfall averages at .

==History==

The site of Fleet was originally heathland in the northern part of the Crondall Hundred. The name &quot;Fleet&quot; was probably derived from the Norman French word &quot;La Flete&quot; meaning &quot;a stream or shallow water&quot; - a reference to the Fleet Pond from which fish had been taken for the monks in Winchester in Medieval times.

In 1792, the Basingstoke Canal opened. The canal passed through the town site, but apart from a few inns to serve the passing trade, it had little effect on the locality. Apart from the Farnham to Reading road, the site remained largely undeveloped until the construction of the London and South Western Railway, which opened in 1840. In that year, a church - &quot;Christ Church&quot;, which was to become the heart of the new ecclesiastical parish of Crookham-cum-Ewshot was built midway between the villages of Crookham and Ewshot. This parish included the area that was later to become the separate town of Fleet. The railway company promoted Fleet Pond for a destination for day excursions, and many people came down from London to skate on the Pond during the Winter. This attracted a number of gentry, particularly retired army officers, who moved to the area bounded by Fleet Road, Elvetham Road and Reading Road North, and laid the foundations of what was to become known locally as &quot;The Blue Triangle&quot;.
By 1860, Charles Lefroy, a local squire, commissioned All Saints&#x27; Church – in the &quot;Blue Triangle&quot; area, in memory of his wife who had died in 1857. The architect was William Burges. The ecclesiastical parish of Crookham-cum-Ewshot was split into two in 1862, with the northern section based on All Saints&#x27; church becoming the new parish of Fleet. On 22 June 2015, the roof of All Saints&#x27; church was destroyed by fire following an arson attack. The church was returned to a condition where it could hold services by 30 April 2023 when it was reconsecrated.

The development of Fleet accelerated when the land to the south east of the &quot;Blue Triangle&quot; was sold for development in 1882. Development on this land was laid out in a grid pattern.

=== As part of the Urban District Council (1904 - 1974) ===
Under the Local Government Act 1894, many of the duties that had previously been shouldered by the ecclesiastical parishes were transferred to new civil parishes, and Crookham, Fleet and Crondall each gained an elected parish council. In 1904, Fleet became an urban district, just ten years after becoming an independent parish. In 1925, and again in 1932, it expanded by taking parts of Elvetham, as a result of the Local Government Act 1929, which saw smaller urban districts merge with their surrounding rural districts, with the result that new districts emerged covering rural as well as urban parishes. As a consequence, the Fleet Urban District in 1932 expanded south of the canal and took 45% of the Crookham acreage and 61% of the population, with the rump of the parish of Crookham being returned to Crondall parish. In addition, a small area of Minley with Hawley, that consequently became the modern development of Ancells Farm, was also transferred to the expanded Fleet Urban District.

=== As part of the Hart District Council (1974 onwards) ===
Fleet expanded over the decades, with new residential areas being built at Ancells Farm, Zebon Copse (Church Crookham, Crookham Village and Dogmersfield are included in the built-up area, as per the Government Statistical Service) and Elvetham Heath. Completed in 2008, Elvetham Heath was one of the UK&#x27;s largest new housing developments at the time, and added some 3,500 inhabitants to Fleet&#x27;s population, bringing its total population up to around 35,000. This represented a 20% population increase in less than a decade.

Earlier in the 1990s, two developments in Fleet involved a double opening on 10 May 1991; the Hart Shopping Centre, which was opened officially by the Duchess Of York, and the old Hart Leisure Centre on Hitches Lane. The old Hart Leisure Centre was replaced by a new one on the other side of the road in 2019.

Fleet had been a dormitory town for commuters to London. It now has several business parks, mainly occupied by Information Technology companies.

==Politics and administration==
Fleet is administered by Hart District Council and Hampshire County Council. The parliamentary constituency is North East Hampshire. In April 2010, some of the responsibilities of Hart District Council were devolved to three new parish councils: Fleet Town Council, Elvetham Heath Parish Council and Church Crookham Parish Council.

===Wards===
Fleet and Church Crookham are divided into the following wards:

*Fleet Central: Small part of the &quot;Blue Triangle&quot; the late Victorian/Edwardian town centre, and a small part south of the canal that was historically part of Crookham prior to 1976.
*Fleet East: Pondtail, Ancells Farm and the former Pyestock site (Hartland Village). 
*Fleet West: Large part of the &quot;Blue Triangle&quot;, Elvetham Heath and Edenbrook.

<doc id="235247" wikidata="Q899425" url="?curid=235247" title="Brass rubbing">
<text>Brass rubbing was originally a largely British enthusiasm for reproducing onto paper monumental brasses – commemorative brass plaques found in churches, usually originally on the floor, from between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. It was particularly popular in Britain because of the large number of medieval brasses surviving there, more than in any other country. The concept of recording textures of things is more generally called making a rubbing. What distinguishes rubbings from frottage is that rubbings are meant to reproduce the form of something being transferred, whereas frottage is usually only intended to use a general texture.

Brass rubbings are created by laying a sheet of paper on top of a brass (then called &quot;latten&quot; - a zinc-copper alloy produced via the obsolete calamine brass process) and rubbing the paper with graphite, wax, or chalk, a process similar to rubbing a pencil over a piece of paper placed on top of a coin. In the past rubbings were most commonly made using the equivalent of what nowadays is called &quot;butcher&#x27;s paper&quot; [a roll of whitish paper] laid down over the brass and rubbed with &quot;heelball&quot;, a waxy glob of black crayon once used to shine shoes. Now most brass rubbers purchase special paper rolls of heavy duty black velvety material, and the crayons are gold, silver or bronze (other colours are available).

According to the Monumental Brass Society, the practice of brass rubbing does not harm a brass if competently carried out, assuming the brass is securely fixed. Nonetheless, in many cases creating rubbings is banned by historical sites and churches. Brass rubbing centres with replicas of original brass plaques have become a prime source for brass rubbings in the UK. Replicas are often not the same scale as the original.

<doc id="235248" wikidata="Q703961" url="?curid=235248" title="Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy">
<text>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also known as prion diseases, are a group of progressive, incurable, and fatal conditions that are associated with the prion hypothesis and affect the brain and nervous system of many animals, including humans, cattle, and sheep. According to the most widespread hypothesis, they are transmitted by prions, though some other data suggest an involvement of a &quot;Spiroplasma&quot; infection. Mental and physical abilities deteriorate and many tiny holes appear in the cortex causing it to appear like a sponge when brain tissue obtained at autopsy is examined under a microscope. The disorders cause impairment of brain function which may result in memory loss, personality changes, and abnormal or impaired movement which worsen over time.

TSEs of humans include Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru, as well as the recently discovered variably protease-sensitive prionopathy and familial spongiform encephalopathy. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease itself has four main forms, the sporadic (sCJD), the hereditary/familial (fCJD), the iatrogenic (iCJD) and the variant form (vCJD). These conditions form a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms.

TSEs in non-human mammals include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle – popularly known as &quot;mad cow disease&quot; – and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk. The variant form of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans is caused by exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions.

Unlike other kinds of infectious disease, which are spread by agents with a DNA or RNA genome (such as virus or bacteria), the infectious agent in TSEs is believed to be a prion, thus being composed solely of protein material. Misfolded prion proteins carry the disease between individuals and cause deterioration of the brain. TSEs are unique diseases in that their aetiology may be genetic, sporadic, or infectious via ingestion of infected foodstuffs and via iatrogenic means (e.g., blood transfusion). Most TSEs are sporadic and occur in an animal with no prion protein mutation. Inherited TSE occurs in animals carrying a rare mutant prion allele, which expresses prion proteins that contort by themselves into the disease-causing conformation. Transmission occurs when healthy animals consume tainted tissues from others with the disease. In the 1980s and 1990s, bovine spongiform encephalopathy spread in cattle in an epidemic fashion. This occurred because cattle were fed the processed remains of other cattle, a practice now banned in many countries. In turn, consumption (by humans) of bovine-derived foodstuff which contained prion-contaminated tissues resulted in an outbreak of the variant form of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in the 1990s and 2000s.

Prions cannot be transmitted through the air, through touching, or most other forms of casual contact. However, they may be transmitted through contact with infected tissue, body fluids, or contaminated medical instruments. Normal sterilization procedures such as boiling or irradiating materials fail to render prions non-infective. However, treatment with strong, almost undiluted bleach and/or sodium hydroxide, or heating to a minimum of 134 °C, does destroy prions.

==Classification==

Differences in shape between the different prion protein forms are poorly understood.

==Signs and symptoms==
The degenerative tissue damage caused by human prion diseases (CJD, GSS, and kuru) is characterised by four features: spongiform change (the presence of many small holes), the death of neurons, astrocytosis (abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons), and amyloid plaque formation. These features are shared with prion diseases in animals, and the recognition of these similarities prompted the first attempts to transmit a human prion disease (kuru) to a primate in 1966, followed by CJD in 1968 and GSS in 1981. These neuropathological features have formed the basis of the histological diagnosis of human prion diseases for many years, although it was recognized that these changes are enormously variable both from case to case and within the central nervous system in individual cases.

The clinical signs in humans vary, but commonly include personality changes, psychiatric problems such as depression, lack of coordination, and/or an unsteady gait (ataxia). Patients also may experience involuntary jerking movements called myoclonus, unusual sensations, insomnia, confusion, or memory problems. In the later stages of the disease, patients have severe mental impairment (dementia) and lose the ability to move or speak.

Early neuropathological reports on human prion diseases suffered from a confusion of nomenclature, in which the significance of the diagnostic feature of spongiform change was occasionally overlooked. The subsequent demonstration that human prion diseases were transmissible reinforced the importance of spongiform change as a diagnostic feature, reflected in the use of the term &quot;spongiform encephalopathy&quot; for this group of disorders.

Prions appear to be most infectious when in direct contact with affected tissues. For example, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease has been transmitted to patients taking injections of growth hormone harvested from human pituitary glands, from cadaver dura allografts and from instruments used for brain surgery (Brown, 2000) (prions can survive the &quot;autoclave&quot; sterilization process used for most surgical instruments). It is also believed that dietary consumption of affected animals can cause prions to accumulate slowly, especially when cannibalism or similar practices allow the proteins to accumulate over more than one generation. An example is kuru, which reached epidemic proportions in the mid-20th century in the Fore people of Papua New Guinea, who used to consume their dead as a funerary ritual. Laws in developed countries now ban the use of rendered ruminant proteins in ruminant feed as a precaution against the spread of prion infection in cattle and other ruminants.

Note that not all encephalopathies are caused by prions, as in the cases of PML (caused by the JC virus), CADASIL (caused by abnormal NOTCH3 protein activity), and Krabbe disease (caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactosylceramidase). Progressive Spongiform Leukoencephalopathy (PSL)—which is a spongiform encephalopathy—is also probably not caused by a prion, although the adulterant that causes it among heroin smokers has not yet been identified. This, combined with the highly variable nature of prion disease pathology, is why a prion disease cannot be diagnosed based solely on a patient&#x27;s symptoms.

==Cause==
===Genetics===

Familial forms of prion disease are caused by inherited mutations in the PRNP gene. Only a small percentage of all cases of prion disease run in families, however. Most cases of prion disease are sporadic, which means they occur in people without any known risk factors or gene mutations. In rare circumstances, prion diseases also can be transmitted by exposure to prion-contaminated tissues or other biological materials obtained from individuals with prion disease.&lt;efsa&gt;It could be transmitted by Five cases of atypical BSE were reported in cattle across the and five more reported by countries. A total of 721 cases of scrapie were detected in small ruminants in the 27 Member States and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland: 538 in sheep (557 in 2022) and 183 in goats (224 in 2022).Surveillance of TSE in cervids is voluntary in the. Only Norway confirmed one case of Chronic Wasting Disease (one wild European moose)&lt;/efsa&gt;.The PRNP gene provides the instructions to make a protein called the prion protein (PrP). Under normal circumstances, this protein may be involved in transporting copper into cells. The protein may also be involved in protecting brain cells and helping them communicate.

===Protein-only hypothesis===
Protein could be the infectious agent, inducing its own replication by causing conformational change of normal cellular PrPC into PrPSc. Evidence for this hypothesis:
:*Infectivity titre correlates with PrPSc levels. However, this is disputed.
:*PrPSc is an isomer of PrPC
:*Denaturing PrP removes infectivity
;*PrP-null mice cannot be infected
;*PrPC depletion in the neural system of mice with established neuroinvasive prion infection reverses early spongeosis and behavioural deficits, halts further disease progression and increases life-span

===Multi-component hypothesis===

While not containing a nucleic acid genome, prions may be composed of more than just a protein. Purified PrPC appears unable to convert to the infectious PrPSc form, unless other components are added, such as RNA and lipids. These other components, termed cofactors, may form part of the infectious prion, or they may serve as catalysts for the replication of a protein-only prion.

===Viral hypothesis===
This hypothesis postulates that a yet undiscovered infectious viral agent is the cause of the disease. The strongest evidence for viral replication in TSE infected brains is that long double stranded RNA is detected in 22L scrapie infected mouse brains 
Other evidence for this hypothesis is as follows:
:*Brain particle titers purified of PrP retain infectivity.
:*Brain titers exposed to nucleases reduced infectivity by &gt;=99%.
:*Incubation time is comparable to a lentivirus.
:*Strain variation of different isolates of PrPsc.

==Diagnosis==

There continues to be a very practical problem with diagnosis of prion diseases, including BSE and CJD. They have an incubation period of months to decades during which there are no symptoms, even though the pathway of converting the normal brain PrP protein into the toxic, disease-related PrPSc form has started. At present, there is virtually no way to detect PrPSc reliably except by examining the brain using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods after death. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrPSc form of the PrP protein is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids like blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrPSc, but there are still no fully accepted methods for use in materials such as blood.

In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so that it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrPSc after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals&#x27; brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals&#x27; lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrPSc could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared.

==Treatment==
There are currently no known ways to cure or prevent prion disease. Certain medications can slow down the progression of the disease. But ultimately, supportive care is currently the only option for infected individuals.

==Epidemiology==
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are very rare but can reach epidemic proportions. It is very hard to map the spread of the disease due to the difficulty of identifying individual strains of the prions. This means that, if animals at one farm begin to show the disease after an outbreak on a nearby farm, it is very difficult to determine whether it is the same strain affecting both herds—suggesting transmission—or if the second outbreak came from a completely different source.

Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was discovered in 1920. It occurs sporadically over the world but is very rare. It affects about one person per million each year. Typically, the cause is unknown for these cases. It has been found to be passed on genetically in some cases. 250 patients contracted the disease through iatrogenic transmission (from use of contaminated surgical equipment). This was before equipment sterilization was required in 1976, and there have been no other iatrogenic cases since then. In order to prevent the spread of infection, the World Health Organization created a guide to tell health care workers what to do when CJD appears and how to dispose of contaminated equipment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been keeping surveillance on CJD cases, particularly by looking at death certificate information.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease found in North America in deer and elk. The first case was identified as a fatal wasting syndrome in the 1960s. It was then recognized as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in 1978. Surveillance studies showed the endemic of CWD in free-ranging deer and elk spread in northeastern Colorado, southeastern Wyoming and western Nebraska. It was also discovered that CWD may have been present in a proportion of free-ranging animals decades before the initial recognition. In the United States, the discovery of CWD raised concerns about the transmission of this prion disease to humans. Many apparent cases of CJD were suspected transmission of CWD, however the evidence was lacking and not convincing.

In the 1980s and 1990s, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or &quot;mad cow disease&quot;) spread in cattle at an epidemic rate. The total estimated number of cattle infected was approximately 750,000 between 1980 and 1996. This occurred because the cattle were fed processed remains of other cattle. Then human consumption of these infected cattle caused an outbreak of the human form CJD. There was a dramatic decline in BSE when feeding bans were put in place. On May 20, 2003, the first case of BSE was confirmed in North America. The source could not be clearly identified, but researchers suspect it came from imported BSE-infected cow meat. In the United States, the USDA created safeguards to minimize the risk of BSE exposure to humans.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was discovered in 1996 in England. There is strong evidence to suggest that vCJD was caused by the same prion as bovine spongiform encephalopathy. A total of 231 cases of vCJD have been reported since it was first discovered. These cases have been found in a total of 12 countries with 178 in the United Kingdom, 27 in France, five in Spain, four in Ireland, four in the United States, three in the Netherlands, three in Italy, two in Portugal, two in Canada, and one each in Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan.

==History==
In the 5th century BCE, Hippocrates described a disease like TSE in cattle and sheep, which he believed also occurred in humans. Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus records cases of a disease with similar characteristics in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. In 1755, an outbreak of scrapie was discussed in the British House of Commons and may have been present in Britain for some time before that. Although there were unsupported claims in 1759 that the disease was contagious, in general it was thought to be due to inbreeding and countermeasures appeared to be successful. Early-20th-century experiments failed to show transmission of scrapie between animals, until extraordinary measures were taken such as the intra-ocular injection of infected nervous tissue. No direct link between scrapie and human disease was suspected then or has been found since. TSE was first described in humans by Alfons Maria Jakob in 1921. Daniel Carleton Gajdusek&#x27;s discovery that Kuru was transmitted by cannibalism accompanied by the finding of scrapie-like lesions in the brains of Kuru victims strongly suggested an infectious basis to TSE. A paradigm shift to a non-nucleic infectious entity was required when the results were validated with an explanation of how a prion protein might transmit spongiform encephalopathy. Not until 1988 was the neuropathology of spongiform encephalopathy properly described in cows. The alarming amplification of BSE in the British cattle herd heightened fear of transmission to humans and reinforced the belief in the infectious nature of TSE. This was confirmed with the identification of a Kuru-like disease, called new variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, in humans exposed to BSE. Although the infectious disease model of TSE has been questioned in favour of a prion transplantation model that explains why cannibalism favours transmission, the search for a viral agent was, as of 2007, being continued in some laboratories.

<text>Robert de Sorbon (; 9 October 1201 – 15 August 1274) was a French theologian, the chaplain of Louis IX of France, and founder of the Sorbonne college in Paris.

==Biography==
Born into a poor family in Sorbon, in what is now the Ardennes &quot;département&quot;, Robert de Sorbon entered the Church and was educated in Reims and Paris. He was noted for his piety and attracted the patronage of the Comte d&#x27;Artois and King Louis IX of France, later known as Saint Louis. He became the canon of Cambrai around 1251 before being appointed canon of Paris and the king&#x27;s confessor in 1258.

Sorbon began to teach around 1253 and in 1257 established the &quot;Maison de Sorbonne&quot;, a college in Paris originally intended to teach theology to twenty poor students. It was sponsored by King Louis and received the endorsement of Pope Alexander IV in 1259. He was assisted by Peter of Limoges. It subsequently grew into a major centre of learning and became the core of what would become the University of Paris. Sorbon served as chancellor of the university, taught and preached there from 1258 until his death.

He died in Paris in 1274.

The library at the University of Reims, which opened in 2006, is named after Robert de Sorbon.

<text>A wrench or spanner is a tool used to provide grip and mechanical advantage in applying torque to turn objects—usually rotary fasteners, such as nuts and bolts—or keep them from turning.

In the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand &quot;spanner&quot; is the standard term. The most common shapes are called &quot;open-ended spanner&quot; and &quot;ring spanner&quot;. The term &quot;wrench&quot; is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. tap wrench and pipe wrench), or may be used for a monkey wrench—an adjustable pipe wrench.

In North American English, &quot;wrench&quot; is the standard term. The most common shapes are called &quot;open-end wrench&quot; and &quot;box-end wrench&quot;. In American English, &quot;spanner&quot; refers to a specialized wrench with a series of pins or tabs around the circumference. (These pins or tabs fit into the holes or notches cut into the object to be turned). In American commerce, such a wrench may be called a &quot;spanner wrench&quot; to distinguish it from the British sense of &quot;spanner&quot;.

Higher quality wrenches are typically made from chromium-vanadium alloy tool steels and are often drop-forged. They are frequently chrome-plated to resist corrosion and for ease of cleaning.

Hinged tools, such as pliers or tongs, are not generally considered wrenches in English, but exceptions are the plumber wrench (pipe wrench in British English) and Mole wrench (sometimes Mole grips in British English).

The word can also be used in slang to describe an unexpected obstacle, for example, &quot;He threw a spanner in the works&quot; (in U.S. English, &quot;monkey wrench&quot;).

==Etymology==

&#x27;Wrench&#x27; is derived from Middle English &quot;wrench&quot;, from Old English &quot;wrenċ&quot;, from Proto-Germanic &quot;*wrankiz&quot; (&quot;a turning, twisting&quot;). The oldest recorded use dates to 1794.

&#x27;Spanner&#x27; came into use in the 1630s, referring to the tool for winding the spring of a wheel-lock firearm. From German &quot;Spanner&quot; (n.), from &quot;spannen&quot; (v.) (&quot;to join, fasten, extend, connect&quot;), from Proto-Germanic &quot;*spannan&quot;, from PIE root &quot;*(s)pen-&quot; (&quot;to draw, stretch, spin&quot;). 

==History==
Wrenches and applications using wrenches or devices that needed wrenches, such as pipe clamps and suits of armor, have been noted by historians as far back as the 15th century. Adjustable coach wrenches for the odd-sized nuts of wagon wheels were manufactured in England and exported to North America in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The mid 19th century began to see patented wrenches that used a screw for narrowing and widening the jaws, including patented monkey wrenches.

Most box end wrenches are sold as &#x27;12-point&#x27; because 12-point wrenches fit over both 12-point and 6-point bolts. 12-point wrenches also offer a higher number of engagement points over six-point. However, 12-point wrenches have been known to cause round-off damage to 6-point bolts as they provide less contact space.

==Types==
==Other types of keys==
These types of keys are not emically classified as wrenches by English speakers, but they are etically similar in function to wrenches.

<text>Miskolc ( , , ; Czech and ; ; ; ) is a city in northeastern Hungary, known for its heavy industry. With a population of 161,265 as of 1 January 2014, Miskolc is the fourth largest city in Hungary (behind Budapest, Debrecen, and Szeged). It is also the county capital of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén and the regional centre of Northern Hungary.

==Etymology==
The name derives from &quot;Miško&quot;, Slavic form of Michael. &quot;Miškovec&quot; → &quot;Miskolc&quot; with the same development as &quot;Lipovec&quot; → &quot;Lipólc&quot;, &quot;Lipóc&quot;. The name is associated with the Miskolc clan (also Miskóc or Myscouch, Slovak Miškovec, plural Miškovci) named after the settlement or vice versa. Earliest mentions are &quot;que nunc vocatur Miscoucy&quot; (around 1200), &quot;de Myschouch&quot; (1225), &quot;Ponyt de genere Myscouch&quot; (1230), &quot;in Miscovcy&quot; (1245).

== Geography ==

The city lies at the meeting point of different geographical regions – east of the Bükk mountains, in the valley of the river Sajó and the streams Hejő and Szinva. According to the 2001 Census the city has a total area of . The ground level slopes gradually; the difference between the highest and lowest area is about .

The lowest areas are the banks of the river Sajó, with an altitude of . The area belongs to the Great Plain region and is made up of sedimentary rocks. Between the Avas hill and Diósgyőr lies the hilly area of the &quot;Lower Bükk&quot; () consisting of sandstone, marl, clay, layers of coal, from the tertiary period, and volcanic rocks from the Miocene.

The &quot;Central Bükk&quot;, a gently sloping mountainous area with an altitude between , is situated between Diósgyőr and Lillafüred; the area is made up of limestone, slate, dolomite and other rocks from the Triassic period. The surface was formed mostly by karstic erosions.

The highest area, the high &quot;Higher Bükk&quot; bore &quot;Bükk Highlands&quot; begin at Lillafüred. This mostly consists of sea sediments (limestone, slate, dolomite) from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, and volcanic rocks like diabase and porphyry. Several caves can be found in the area. The city is also known for the lowest temperature ever recorded in Hungary at.

===Climate===
Summers are fresh but sometimes warm and humid in Miskolc. Daytime temperatures of or higher are commonplace. Snow and ice are dominant during the winter season. Miskolc receives about 120 centimetres of snowfall annually. Days below freezing and nights below both occur in the winter.
== History ==
The area has been inhabited since ancient times – archaeological findings date back to the Paleolithic, proving human presence for over 70,000 years . Its first known dwellers were the Cotini, one of the Celt tribes. The area has been occupied by Hungarians since the &quot;Conquest&quot; in the late 9th century. It was first mentioned by this name around 1210 AD. The Miskóc clan lost their power when King Charles I centralized his power by curbing the power of the oligarchs.

Miskolc was elevated to the rank of oppidum (market town) in 1365 by King Louis I. He also had the castle of the nearby town Diósgyőr (now a district of Miskolc) transformed into a Gothic fortress. The city developed in a dynamic way, but during the Ottoman occupation of most of Hungary the development of Miskolc was brought to a standstill. The Ottomans under Suleiman the Magnificent took Miskolc in 1544 and the city prospered further until 1687. It was also ruled by Ottomans after Battle of Mezőkeresztes in 1596 as part of Eyalet of Egir until 1687. It was during these years that Miskolc became an important centre of wine-growing. By the end of the 17th century the population of the city was as large as that of Kassa/Košice, and 13 guilds had been founded.

During the war of independence against Habsburg rule in the early 18th century, Prince Francis II Rákóczi, the leader of the Hungarians put his headquarters in Miskolc. The imperial forces sacked and burnt the city in 1707. Four years later half of the population fell victim of a cholera epidemic. Miskolc recovered quickly, and another age of prosperity began again. In 1724, Miskolc was chosen to be the city where the county hall of Borsod county would be built. Many other significant buildings were built in the 18th and 19th centuries, including the city hall, schools such as Lévay József Református Gimnázium és Diákotthon, churches, the synagogue, and the theatre. The theatre is commonly regarded as the first stone-built theatre of Hungary, although the first one was actually built in Kolozsvár (then a part of Hungary, now Cluj-Napoca, Romania). According to the first nationally held census (1786) the city had a population of 14,719, and 2,414 houses.
These years brought prosperity, but the cholera epidemic of 1873 and the flood of 1878 took many lives. Several buildings were destroyed by the flood, but bigger and grander buildings were built in their places. World War I did not affect the city directly, but many people died, either from warfare or from the cholera epidemic. It was occupied by Czechoslovak troops between 1918 and 1919 after the First World War.

After the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost Kassa (today Košice, Slovakia) and Miskolc became the sole regional center of northern Hungary. This was one of the reasons for the enormous growth of the city during the 1930s and 1940s.

Early in World War II Hungary became an ally of Nazi Germany. Unhappy with the Hungarian government, German troops occupied Hungary on March 19, 1944 and put the anti-semitic Arrow Cross Party in charge of the government. Jews in Miskolc and elsewhere were ordered to wear yellow stars on their clothing. Under the supervision of Nazi SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Adolf Eichmann&quot;,&quot; &quot;deportations&quot; from Miskolc began on June 11 or 12th, 1944. Over 14,000 Jewish adults and children were sent by cattle car to Auschwitz, where most were gassed on arrival. After the war Jews who survived the holocaust returned to Miskolc hoping to reclaim their land and possessions. Over 130 were rounded up by members of the local Arrow Cross Party and summarily murdered. The Jewish cemetery on a hill overlooking Miskolc has a memorial for them. It includes the 10 commandments, carved in stone, all written in Hebrew except &quot;Thou shall not kill,&quot; which is written in Hungarian.

The preparation for World War II established Miskolc as the national centre of heavy industry, a position the city maintained until the 1990s. Although Miskolc suffered a lot during the last year of the war, it recovered quickly, and by absorbing the surrounding villages, it became the second-largest city of Hungary with more than 200,000 inhabitants.

On July 30 and August 1, 1946, the Miskolc pogrom led to death of one accused Jewish black marketeer, the wounding of another, and subsequently the death of a Jewish policeman. Economic hardship and anti-Semitism motivated the riots.

In 1949, the University of Miskolc was founded (as a successor of the &quot;Academy of Mining&quot;, formerly in Selmecbánya, which is now Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia).
During its long history Miskolc survived fires, floods, plagues and foreign invasions, but maintained its position as the centre of northeastern Hungary. The 1990s brought a crisis in the iron industry with a decline in the population.

Miskolc is now trying to become known as a cultural – instead of merely an industrial – city. Among the various cultural events, one of the most important festivities is the International Opera Festival, held every summer.

Tourist destinations in Miskolc include Tapolca, Lillafüred and Felsőhámor. Tapolca has a park with a boating pond and the unique Cave Bath. Lillafüred and Felsőhámor are pretty villages in a valley surrounded by mountains and forests; their sights include the Hotel Palace on the shore of the Lake Hámori, the Szinva waterfall (the highest waterfall of the country), the Anna Cave and the István Cave.

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===

The population (around 1910) is multidenominational and multiethnical, and the differences in the level of education mirrors the stratification of society, following these facts. http://mek.oszk.hu/16900/16992

=== Religion ===

Dominant religion in Miskolc is Roman Catholicism followed by Calvinism and Greek Catholicism.

== Economy ==


Miskolc is generally thought of as an industrial city, and the largest boost to its economy was indeed provided by the industrialization during the Socialist era; in fact industry (including metallurgy) has a long history in the city.

Miskolc was already an important market town in the Middle Ages, mostly due to its proximity to the main trade routes of the region. In regards of the economy, real development started only after the Ottoman occupation. In the 18th century, the town already had a lumber mill, a paper manufacture, a brewery, a gunpowder factory and fifteen mills on the Szinva stream. The glass works manufactures and iron furnaces appeared in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The first iron furnace, built by Henrik Fazola around 1770, did not survive, but the second one, built in 1813, can still be visited. Several new settlements were formed in the Bükk mountains to provide dwellings for the workers of glass works manufactures and furnaces. Many of them – including Alsóhámor, Felsőhámor, Ómassa and Bükkszentlászló – are now parts of Miskolc.

Development quickened from the second half of the 19th century, partly because of the political situation (after the Ausgleich) and partly because of the newly constructed railway line. A large furnace (second largest in the country) was built in Diósgyőr, and several other factories were built. The mining industry became more and more important, too. Within forty years the population doubled. The industrialization led to the forming of &quot;Greater Miskolc&quot; with the unification of Miskolc and Diósgyőr (1945) and several nearby towns and villages (between 1950 and 1981). The unification was only the first step in Miskolc being developed into an industrial centre. Development reached its highest point in the 1980s, when the metal factory had more than 18,000 workers and production was over one million tons per year. The population hit all-time record (over 200,000 inhabitants), ⅔ of the working people worked in heavy industry.

The economic recession after the end of the Socialist era hit the industrial cities of Northern Hungary the hardest. The unemployment rate rose until it became one of the highest in the country, the population of Miskolc dramatically decreased (not only because of unemployment though, but also due to suburbanization which became prevalent nationwide). The economic situation of the city went through a change, smaller enterprises appeared in place of the large state-owned companies.

By the early 2000s the decade of changes was over, and the city went through the recession successfully. International companies and supermarkets appeared in the area. The local government is trying to strengthen the city&#x27;s role in culture and tourism. By the end of 2004, the highway M3 had reached the city.

== Sports ==
The most popular sport in Miskolc is football. The leading club of the city is Diósgyőri VTK (short name: DVTK). They have won the Hungarian Cup several times and represented Hungary many times in Europe. The capacity of the stadium, DVTK Stadion, is 14 655 and the stadium has under-soil heating and fully covered stands.

The other team, Miskolci VSC, plays in the county division. Miskolc has got other former first division representatives, namely Miskolci Attila (seven seasons at the highest level), and Perecesi TK (one).

The women&#x27;s volleyball team of MVSC also plays at the highest Hungarian level.

Former motorcycle speedway team Speedway Miskolc (8 times champions of Hungary) joined the Team Speedway Polish Championship from 2006 to 2010. They won the 2007 European Speedway Club Champions&#x27; Cup with world champion Jason Crump. They were based at the Borsod Volán Stadion.

== City parts of Miskolc ==

=== Avas ===

The Avas is a hill () in the heart of Miskolc. On the hilltop stands the Avas lookout tower, the symbol of the city. On the northern part of the hill, close to downtown Erzsébet Square, is the Gothic Protestant Church of Avas, one of the two oldest buildings of Miskolc (the other is the Castle of Diósgyőr.) The limestone caves of Avas are used as wine cellars; the narrow, winding streets give a Mediterranean atmosphere to this part of Avas Hill. The southern part of Avas, also called Avas-South, is where the largest housing estate of the city stands, with 10-story Socialist-style concrete buildings providing homes for about one-third of the city&#x27;s population.

=== Belváros (City centre) ===
Miskolc&#x27;s city centre is not as rich in monuments as that of other cities; only the Main Street (Széchenyi St.), &quot;Városház tér&quot; (City Hall Square) and &quot;Erzsébet tér&quot; (Elizabeth Square) have preserved the 19th-century style of the town. There are not only historical buildings but also modern shopping malls and offices in the city centre.

=== Diósgyőr ===
The other town forming today&#x27;s Greater Miskolc is mostly famous for its medieval castle. Miskolc&#x27;s football team also got its name from Diósgyőr, since their stadium stands there. Historical Diósgyőr is connected to Historical Miskolc by a district called &quot;Új(diós)győr&quot; (Újgyőr); its main square is an important traffic hub. Also in Új(diós)győr &quot;(Diósgyőr-Vasgyár)&quot; stands the steel factory that made Miskolc the most important heavy industrial city of Hungary (and earned it the nickname &quot;Steel City&quot;). Diósgyőri Gimnázium also stands in this district.

=== Egyetemváros (University Town) ===
The University of Miskolc is among the newer ones. It was founded in the 1950s, so its buildings are not old, historical ones. University Town is one of the newer parts of the city and can be found between Miskolc and the holiday resort Miskolctapolca. The university, the campus, and the sport facilities are surrounded by a large park.

=== Hejőcsaba and Görömböly ===
Two former villages that were annexed to the city in 1945 and 1950. Görömböly still looks like a small town of its own.

=== Lillafüred ===
Another holiday resort, Miskolc-Lillafüred, is a village surrounded by the Bükk mountains. Its most notable building is the Palace Hotel (Palotaszálló).

=== Martin-Kertváros ===
Martin-Kertváros (in Slovak: Martinská osada) is a suburban area.

=== Miskolctapolca ===
One of the most well-known holiday resorts in the country, Tapolca (officially Miskolctapolca or Miskolc-Tapolca to avoid confusion with the Transdanubian town of the same name) is the home of the unique Cave Bath, a natural cave with thermal water. Tapolca is quite far from the city centre and counts as one of the posh areas of Miskolc. It is a popular tourist attraction.

=== Alsóhámor, Bükkszentlászló, Felsőhámor, Ómassa, Szirma ===

<text>Nakhodka (, means &quot;finding&quot;) is a port city in Primorsky Krai, Russia, located on the Trudny Peninsula jutting into the Nakhodka Bay of the Sea of Japan, about east of Vladivostok (169 kilometers by car ), the administrative center of the krai. Population: 

==History==

The Nakhodka Bay, around which the city is organized, was first known to the Russians on the corvette &quot;Amerika&quot;, which sought shelter in the bay during a storm in 1859. In honor of this occasion, the ice-free and relatively calm bay was named Nakhodka, which in Russian means &quot;discovery&quot; or &quot;lucky find&quot;.

An imperial settlement existed here from 1868 to 1872 but was abandoned following the death of its administrator, Harald Furuhjelm. In the fall of 1870, Otto Wilhelm Lindholm established a whaling station across the bay from the settlement. In the spring of 1871 he fitted out his schooner &quot;Hannah Rice&quot; and sailed to Posyet, where he caught six gray whales.

Until the 20th century, the area around the bay remained uninhabited. When the Soviet government decided to build a harbor in the area in the 1930s, a number of small settlements were founded, which were merged as a work settlement in the 1940s. On May 18, 1950, the settlement, by then with a population of about 28,000 residents, was granted town status.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with three rural localities, incorporated as Nakhodka City Under Krai Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Nakhodka City Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Nakhodkinsky Urban Okrug.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Nakhodka has one of the mildest climates in Primorsky Krai and in the whole of the Asian part of Russia. Average temperature in January is ; in August (the warmest month), it is . It is classified as a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;, Trewartha climate classification &quot;Dcbo&quot;) due to the vast seasonal differences and is a very cold climate for a coastal location below 43 degrees latitude. The maritime influence is manifested in low diurnal temperature variation and a vast summer seasonal lag. Due to the influence of the interior, there is a sharp drop in temperatures between October and November. Half of the year has mean temperatures above , in spite of the warmest month being only moderately warm and the coldest month having quite severe cold, with a very low seasonal lag in winter. 


== Economy and infrastructure ==
The city&#x27;s economy, based mostly around a port and port-related activity such as fish processing and canning, had suffered since 1991 as Vladivostok was opened to foreign activity again. Local industry also took a hit during the 1998 Russian financial crisis.

Nakhodka is a transport junction where goods from Japan are transferred from ships in the Port of Vostochny onto the Russian railway system, including the Trans-Siberian Railway portion of the Eurasian Land Bridge. JSC Vostochny Port, a stevedoring company, is headquartered in the city.

The Port of Kozmino has been since 2012 the eastern terminus of the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline.

==Sports==
FC Okean Nakhodka was the only professional sport club in the city. It spent the 1992 and 1993 seasons in the Russian Premier League, although the club later folded and was refounded in the amateur leagues. It is also the home town of association football player Viktor Fayzulin.

==Twin towns and sister cities==

Nakhodka has the following sister city relationships:

<doc id="235258" wikidata="Q607619" url="?curid=235258" title="Screw cap">
<text>A screw cap or closure is a common type of closure for bottles, jars, and tubes.

== History ==
The first screw-on lid was patented in 1858 by John Landis Mason for a jar that became known as the Mason jar.

==Usage==

A screw closure is a mechanical device which is screwed on and off of a &quot;finish&quot; on a container. Either continuous threads or lugs are used. It must be engineered to be cost-effective, to provide an effective seal (and barrier), to be compatible with the contents, to be easily opened by the consumer, often to be reclosable, and to comply with product, package, and environmental laws and regulations. Manufacturers may ensure the integrity of a screw cap using a cap torque tester. Some closures need to be tamper resistant and have child-resistant packaging features. A tamper-evident band is a common tamper warning for screw caps of bottles, for example.

==Wine industry==

Screw caps&#x27; use as an alternative to cork for sealing wine bottles is gaining increasing support. A screw cap is a metal cap that screws onto threads on the neck of a bottle, generally with a metal skirt down the neck to resemble the traditional wine capsule (&quot;foil&quot;). A layer of plastic (often PVDC), cork, rubber, or other soft material is used as wad to make a seal with the mouth of the bottle.

==Sake industry==
Sake bottles are almost universally closed with screw caps (some are packed in barrels, or novelty bottles).

<text>The Linge is a river in the Betuwe that is 99.8 km long, which makes it one of the longest rivers that flow entirely within the Netherlands.

The river starts near the village of Doornenburg near the German border. A legend tells us that if pigs no longer forage at the castle of Doornenburg, the river will dry up. The Linge flows to Zoelen, a small village north of Tiel, and from there it meanders west through the Betuwe, to empty in the Boven Merwede near Gorinchem. Until Geldermalsen, the river is little more than a small, canalised stream. From Geldermalsen on, however, it takes the appearance of a real river complete with dikes and small floodplains. The Linge provides idyllic spots at old towns like Asperen and Leerdam as the picturesque city walls are still in place on the banks of the river.
The river was once a branch of the river Waal, being cut off at Tiel in 1307 or thereabouts (some traces of this can still be seen). The river is navigable for small vessels and is a popular destination for boaters. The banks of the river are important breeding grounds for waterfowl.

This river used to be an important trade route in the olden days. This role has subsequently been taken over by the Rhine and Waal rivers.

Railroad bridges (with nearest train station on the left and right bank):
* between Elst and Arnhem
* between Opheusden and Kesteren
* between Kesteren and Tiel
* between Geldermalsen and Culemborg/Beesd

The river crosses seven motorways:
*Four times the A15 (Rotterdam-Nijmegen)
*Once the A2 (Utrecht-Eindhoven)
*Once the A50 (Arnhem-Eindhoven)
*Once the A325 (Arnhem-Nijmegen)

The riverbanks in the Betuwe are lined with apple orchards, which makes them popular with tourists, particularly in spring when the fruit trees are in blossom. In April, a walking tour is organised in support of the Red Cross, the so-called &#x27;Rode Kruis Bloesemtocht&#x27;.

<doc id="235261" wikidata="Q5453870" url="?curid=235261" title="First Taranaki War">
<text>The First Taranaki War (also known as the North Taranaki War) was an armed conflict over land ownership and sovereignty that took place between Māori and the Colony of New Zealand in the Taranaki region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island from March 1860 to March 1861.

The war was sparked by a dispute between the colonial government and the Te Āti Awa people, led by Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke, over the fraudulent sale of the Pekapeka land block at Waitara. The deal was orchestrated by minor Te Āti Awa rangatira Te Teira Manuka over lands he had no authority to sell under Māori law. Initially a conflict over individual title and collective land ownership, all-out war broke out and soon spread throughout the region. It was fought by more than 3,500 imperial troops brought in from Australia, as well as volunteer soldiers and militia, against Māori forces that fluctuated between a few hundred and about 1,500. Total losses among the imperial, volunteer and militia troops are estimated to have been 238, while Māori casualties totalled about 200, although the proportion of Māori casualties was higher.

The war ended in a ceasefire, with neither side explicitly accepting the peace terms of the other. Although there were claims by the British that they had won the war, there were widely held views at the time they had suffered an unfavourable and humiliating result. Historians have also been divided on the result. Historian James Belich has claimed that the Māori succeeded in thwarting the British bid to impose sovereignty over them, and had therefore been victorious. But he said the Māori victory was a hollow one, leading to the invasion of the Waikato.

In its 1996 report to the Government on Taranaki land claims, the Waitangi Tribunal observed that the war was begun by the Government, which had been the aggressor and unlawful in its actions in launching an attack by its armed forces. An opinion sought by the tribunal from a senior constitutional lawyer stated that the Governor, Thomas Gore Browne, and certain officers were liable for criminal and civil charges for their actions. The term &quot;First Taranaki War&quot; is opposed by some historians, who refer only to the Taranaki Wars, rejecting suggestions that post-1861 conflict was a second war. The 1927 Royal Commission on Confiscated Land also referred to the hostilities between 1864 and 1866 as a continuation of the initial Taranaki war.

==Background==
The catalyst for the war was the disputed sale of of land known as the Pekapeka block, or Teira&#x27;s block, at Waitara. The block&#x27;s location perfectly suited European settlers&#x27; wish for a township and port to serve the north of the Taranaki district and its sale was viewed as a likely precedent for other sales that would open up for settlement all land between New Plymouth and the Waitara River. Pokikake Te Teira Manuka, a minor chief of the Te Atiawa iwi, first offered the land to the New Zealand government in 1857, immediately attracting vehement opposition from the paramount chief of the tribe, Wiremu Kīngi, who declared a veto on the plan. Teira&#x27;s sale was, however, supported by Ihaia Kirikumara and his brother Tamati, who wrote letters to newspapers claiming that European occupation would allow returned slaves to live in security and lessen the chance that Waikato war parties would return.

Governor Browne felt obliged to resist the veto; he insisted Māori had the right to sell if they wished, and wanted to demonstrate support for a friendly chief over an individual who was resisting the Crown&#x27;s authority and the expansion of European law. Browne accepted the purchase with full knowledge of the circumstances and tried to occupy the land, anticipating it would lead to armed conflict. A year earlier Browne had written to the Colonial Office in England, advising: &quot;I have, however, little fear that William King (Kingi) will venture to resort to violence to maintain his assumed right, but I have made every preparation to enforce obedience should he presume to do so.&quot;

Although the pressure for the sale of the block resulted from the colonists&#x27; hunger for land in Taranaki, the greater issue fueling the conflict was the Government&#x27;s desire to impose British administration, law and civilisation on Māori as a demonstration of the substantive sovereignty the British believed they had gained in the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. The hastily written Māori translation, however, had given Māori chiefs an opposing view that the English had gained only nominal sovereignty, or &quot;governorship&quot; of the country as a whole while Māori retained &quot;chieftainship&quot; over their lands, villages and treasures.

By 1860, it was tacitly recognised that British law prevailed in the settlements and Māori custom elsewhere, though the British, who by then outnumbered Māori, were finding this increasingly irksome. One commentator observed, with reference to Waitara: &quot;We seem to be fast approaching a settlement of that point, whether Her Fair Majesty or His Dark Majesty shall reign in New Zealand.&quot; The British were convinced that their system represented the best that civilization had to offer and saw it as their duty and right to impose it on other peoples.

However, in the 20 years since the signing of the Treaty, Māori had made significant political advances. They had moved from being a collection of independent tribes to an effective confederation known as the Māori King Movement, which was centred on the Waikato region, but which had influence over large areas of the North Island. One of the uniting principles of the King Movement was their opposition to the sale of Māori land and the spread of British sovereignty.

The settlement of New Plymouth—at the time &quot;a line of wooden houses straggling untidily along the waterfront and intersected by bush-filled gullies which provided perfect cover for an attacking party&quot;—was deemed vulnerable to assault by hostile Māori because of tensions over land sales and a detachment of British troops had been placed in the settlement in 1855. The killing of Katatore, an opponent of land selling at Waitara, in January 1858—which in turn sparked more feuding among local Māori and threats of a revenge massacre at Waitara by Kingi—prompted the formation of the Taranaki Militia in 1858 and Taranaki Volunteer Rifle Company in 1859.

==Battle at Te Kohia==
Teira was paid a £100 deposit for the land in December 1859. When Māori obstructed surveyors as they began work on the block, Browne responded by declaring martial law throughout Taranaki on 22 February 1860. Two days later a deed for the sale of the disputed Pekapeka block was executed, with 20 Māori signatories of Te Teira&#x27;s family accepted as representing all owners of the land.

On 4 March, Browne ordered Colonel Charles Emilius Gold, commanding the 65th Regiment, the Taranaki Militia and the Taranaki Rifle Volunteers, to occupy the disputed block of land at Waitara in preparation for a survey. Four hundred men landed at Waitara the next day to fortify a position and the survey of the land began on 13 March without resistance.

On the night of 15 March, however, Kingi and about 80 men built an L-shaped pā, or defensive strong point, at Te Kohia, at the south-west extremity of the block, commanding the road access. The next day, they uprooted the surveyors&#x27; boundary markers and when ordered the following day, 17 March, to surrender, they refused. Gold&#x27;s troops opened fire and the Taranaki wars had begun.

Gold&#x27;s troops, by then numbering almost 500, poured in heavy fire all day from as near as 50 metres, firing 200 rounds from two 24-pound howitzers as well as small arms fire. Despite the firepower, the Māori suffered no casualties and abandoned the pā that night. Though it was small—about 650 square yards—the pā had been situated so that it was difficult to surround completely and had also been built with covered trenches and 10 anti-artillery bunkers, roofed with timber and earth, that protected its garrison.

The British objective at Waitara had been a rapid and decisive victory that would destroy the main enemy warrior force, checking and crippling Māori independence and asserting British sovereignty. That mission failed and the Te Kohia clash ended as little more than a minor skirmish with a result that disappointed English settlers.

Yet for Māori, too, the engagement had strong symbolic importance. Outnumbered and outgunned, Kingi needed to draw allies from several places, but by Māori tikanga, or protocol, support would not be offered to an aggressor. Te Kohia pa, hastily built and just as quickly abandoned, appeared to have been built for one purpose: to provide plain evidence of the Governor&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot;. The aggressor having been identified, others were then free to launch reprisals under utu laws.

Within days, Māori war parties began plundering the farms south of New Plymouth, killing six settlers who had not taken refuge in the town. Fearing an attack on New Plymouth was imminent, the British withdrew from Waitara and concentrated around the town.

==Battle of Waireka==
The military action at Waitara brought the result Kingi had been hoping for and within 10 days of the Te Kohia battle, about 500 warriors from the Taranaki, Ngati Ruanui and Ngā Rauru iwi converged on the New Plymouth area to provide support. The warriors built an entrenched and stockaded pā named Kaipopo on one of the hills at Waireka, about 8 km southwest of New Plymouth and 4 km from the Omata stockade that lay on the road to the town. The area was scattered with some houses built by European settlers, and on 27 March, five settlers, including two boys, were either shot or tomahawked in the Omata district.

Tensions in New Plymouth quickly climbed and settlers with large families were ordered, under martial law, to evacuate to the safety of the town. Among those who remained in the Omata area were the Rev. Henry Brown, the Rev. Thomas Gilbert and several others who were either French or Portuguese. All felt safe: both ministers were treated by Māori as tapu or untouchable, while the others were confident the Māori grievance was with only the British.

About 1 pm on 28 March, a British force of about 335 men—28 Navy, 88 from the British 65th Regiment, 103 members of the newly formed Taranaki Rifle Volunteers and 56 from a local militia—set off in two columns to ostensibly rescue those who had remained behind. It would be the first occasion on which a British Volunteer corps engaged an enemy on the battlefield.

Captain Charles Brown, in command of the settlers, was ordered to march down the coast until he reached the rear of the Māori positions at Waireka. The Regulars, under Lieut-Colonel G.F. Murray, marched down the main road to Omata, intending to dislodge a war party reported to be at Whalers Gate, north of Omata. Once the road was clear, it was intended they would be joined by the Volunteers and militia, who would rescue the settlers, before marching back to New Plymouth. Because of the heightened state of fear in New Plymouth, however, Murray had been ordered to return his troops to the town before nightfall. The Volunteers were armed with muzzle-loading Enfield rifles and the militia had old smooth-bore muskets from the 1840s, with each man issued with just 30 rounds of ammunition.

Murray met no resistance at Whalers Gate, but as he approached Waireka he heard the sound of rapid firing towards the coast. He entrenched his men and opened fire on the Kaipopo pā with a rocket tube. The gunfire Murray heard was being exchanged between about 200 Māori warriors—who, armed mostly with double-barrel shotguns and some rifles, were firing from the cover of bush and flax in the river gully—and the militia and Volunteers, who had retreated to the safety of the farmhouse of settler John Jury. Most of the battle took place on the flat farm land below the pa.

About 5.30 pm, Murray sounded the bugle for a retreat, withdrawing his Regulars for the march back to New Plymouth so they could arrive before dark. His withdrawal left the settler force, which had already suffered two killed and eight wounded, isolated at the farmhouse with little ammunition and late in the night, carrying their casualties, they scrambled across paddocks to the Omata stockade, arriving about 12.30 am, before returning to New Plymouth.

Late in the afternoon, meanwhile, Captain Peter Cracroft, commander of HMS &quot;Niger&quot;, had landed 60 bluejackets at New Plymouth and marched via Omata to Waireka, encountering Murray as he prepared to retreat. Cracroft&#x27;s troops fired 24-pound rockets into the pā from a distance of about 700 metres and stormed it at dusk, tearing down three Māori ensigns. The first man into the pā was leading seaman William Odgers, who was awarded a Victoria Cross for bravery–the first awarded in the New Zealand wars. Cracroft&#x27;s men then returned to New Plymouth, without making contact with the settler force, who were still at the Jury farmhouse. The storming of the pā was the second stage of the battle. Most or all or the Maori casualties—between 17 and 40—occurred during the first stage of fighting around the gully and Jury homestead, according to Cowan.

Cracroft was lauded as a hero for his mission, with claims of the number of Māori killed by his troops ranging from 70 to 150. Total European losses were 14 killed and wounded. Historian James Belich has claimed the pā was more of a camp and all but empty and the total Māori casualties amounted to no more than one. He described the &quot;legend&quot; of Waireka as a classic example of the construction of a paper victory, with invented claims of &quot;enormous&quot; losses and a great British victory.

The settlers, apparently overlooked in the fracas, watched the action from their house and the next day made their own way to New Plymouth, where Gilbert said: &quot;It was no wish of ours that an armed expedition should be set on foot on our behalf. We were perfectly safe.&quot;

Murray was widely condemned for his actions in withdrawing his troops and a court of inquiry was convened into his conduct.

==Battle of Puketakauere==
On 20 April 1860 Browne ordered a suspension of hostilities against Taranaki Māori, fearing the intervention of the King Movement and a possible attack on Auckland. He knew he lacked the resources to defend Auckland if troops were engaged in Taranaki. Both Kingi and the Government made repeated diplomatic approaches to King Pōtatau Te Wherowhero seeking his allegiance, but by early May Pōtatau seemed to have decided to offer at least token support to Taranaki Māori, sending a Kingite war party to the district under the control of war chief Epiha Tokohihi. Kingi seized the opportunity to spark a confrontation with the imperial government to demonstrate the viability of resistance and draw stronger Kingite support.

Early in June, Atiawa war chief Hapurona began building a stockaded pā, Onukukaitara, adjacent to an ancient, and apparently unpopulated and unfortified, pā known as Puketakauere. The two pā were sited on a pair of low hills 800m southeast of Te Kohia and 1.6 km south of the garrison known as Camp Waitara (site of the modern town of Waitara), which had been established to protect the surveying of Waitara. The pā posed a military threat to the Waitara garrison and was seen as extreme provocation.

On 23 June, a British reconnaissance party approached the pā, in what may have been an attempt to bait the Māori, and was fired on. Colonel Gold immediately authorised an attack. Before dawn on 27 June, the British commander at Waitara, Major Thomas Nelson, marched out with 350 experienced troops and two 24-pound howitzers to storm the pā, which was defended by about 200 Atiawa.

The troops intended to encircle the two hills, cutting off a path of retreat for the Māori, before destroying Onukukaitara, above the flax-covered stockade of which flew a flag. The troops split into three divisions for the march. Nelson led the main body of almost 180 men and the two howitzers on an approach from the north, intending to bombard the stockade from the south-west. A second division of 125 men, led by Captain William Messenger, was given the more difficult task of approaching the area in darkness through a swampy gully and high fern and scrub to the east, taking possession of the apparently deserted Puketakauere, blocking the path of any possible reinforcements and supporting Nelson&#x27;s efforts against the main target. His approach was made more challenging by the heavy mid-winter rain that had deepened the swamp. The remaining division, about 60 men under Captain Bowdler, was to take up a position on a mound between the pā and Camp Waitara, blocking an escape to the north.

About 7 am, Nelson&#x27;s howitzers began pounding their target, but created only a small breach in the fort. His men then approached the pā across open ground, but came under heavy fire from Māori concealed just metres away in deep trenches in a small natural gully. The attack was described by some survivors as &quot;hotter than anything in the great Indian battles or in the attack on the Redan in the Crimea&quot;.
As they came under fire, Messenger&#x27;s division found itself the target of other Māori who ambushed them from outlying trenches on the fern-covered slopes. Messenger&#x27;s division became disordered and was split into groups. Many troops were tomahawked in the swamp or drowned as they fled to the flooded Waitara River. Most of the wounded were abandoned and many of those were hacked to death. A group of survivors with Messenger managed to join Nelson, who sounded the retreat, while others remained hiding in the swamp and fern and returned to camp later.

Puketakauere was both the most important and most disastrous battle of the First Taranaki War for the British, who suffered losses of 32 killed and 34 wounded, almost one in five of the force engaged. It was also one of the three most clear-cut defeats suffered by imperial troops in New Zealand. Despite claims at the time that the British killed between 130 and 150 of the enemy, Māori casualties were estimated to be just five, including two Maniapoto chiefs.

Colonel Gold came under heavy criticism for the defeat. He was accused of cowardice and stupidity and an attempt was made to persuade the senior militia officer to arrest him. He was subsequently replaced by Major-General Thomas Pratt.

The real reason for the Māori victory, however, was a combination of tactics and engineering techniques. Hapurona had enticed the British to fight at a place of his own choosing and then used the twin ploys of deception and concealment. He created a false target for the British artillery with the fortification of Onukukaitara which, despite its flag and flax-covered stockade, was essentially an empty pā. Māori defences were instead concentrated on the old, apparently unfortified pā, where deep trenches concealed the well-armed warriors until the British were almost at point-blank range. When the British were split into two groups at the two hills, Hapurona was also able to switch warriors from each focus of action, forcing the British to fight two battles while the Māori fought just one.

In the wake of the demoralising loss, the central portion of New Plymouth was entrenched and most women and children were evacuated to Nelson, out of fear the town would be attacked. The garrison was reinforced with almost 250 soldiers from the 40th Regiment, sent from Auckland, as well as additional artillery.

In July Browne convened a month-long conference of chiefs at Kohimarama, Auckland, ostensibly to discuss the Treaty of Waitangi, but with an aim to halt the conflict at Waitara. Browne opened the conference by explaining that the treaty guaranteed racial equality, but he also warned that violating allegiance to the Crown would negate the rights of British citizenship under the treaty. Among the resolutions adopted was one in which chiefs &quot;are pledged to do nothing inconsistent with their declared recognition of the Queen&#x27;s sovereignty, and the union of the two races,&quot; and that they would halt all actions that would tend to breach that covenant. Author Ranginui Walker noted: &quot;The Maori were too trusting. There was no reciprocal promise extracted from the Governor to abide by the Treaty.&quot; Another resolution proposed by Maori &quot;kingmaker&quot; Wiremu Tamihana, which &quot;deprecates in the strongest manner the murders of unarmed Europeans committed by the Natives now fighting at Taranaki&quot;, was also passed.

==Further clashes==

From August to October 1860, there were numerous skirmishes close to New Plymouth, including one on 20 August involving an estimated 200 Māori, just 800 metres from the barracks on Marsland Hill. Many settlers&#x27; farms were burned and the village of Henui, 1.6 km from town, was also destroyed. Several farmers and settlers, including children, were killed by hostile Māori as they ventured beyond the town&#x27;s entrenchments, including John Hurford (tomahawked at Mahoetahi on 3 August), Joseph Sarten (shot and tomahawked, Henui, 4 December), Captain William Cutfield King (shot, Woodleigh estate, 8 February 1861) and Edward Messenger (shot, Brooklands, 3 March). There were frequent skirmishes around Omata and Waireka, where extensive trenches and rifle pits were dug on the Waireka hills to threaten a British redoubt on the site of the Kaipopo pā.

With British forces in Taranaki boosted to about 2,000 by July, the British intensified efforts to crush resistance. Governor Browne was particularly worried that a general uprising would occur while the bulk of troops in the country were concentrated in Taranaki and he appealed to Britain and Australia for more reinforcements. Major Nelson, meanwhile, destroyed several Te Atiawa villages including Manukorihi, Tikorangi and Ratapihipihi, Pratt launched a major attack with 1,400 men near Waitara on 9 September, burning and looting four entrenched villages, and in October, he marched with a force of more than 1,000 to the Kaihihi River at Ōkato to conduct an operation with sapping and heavy artillery to destroy several more pā.

On 6 November, a party of between 50 and 150 Ngati Haua Kingites were routed in a surprise attack by 1,000 troops at the Battle of Mahoetahi.

There were some humiliating setbacks for the British, however, with 1,500 troops retreating from a small Māori force at Huirangi on 11 September and a force of 500 suffering casualties in an ambush while destroying a pā on 29 September.

Kingite warriors continued to travel between Taranaki and Waikato, providing a peak force of about 800 in January 1861, with weapons and ammunition being bought on the black market in Auckland, Waiuku and Kawhia, while in Taranaki posts at Omata, the Bell Block, Waireka and Tataraimaka were garrisoned – with each of those often surrounded by a cordon of pā.

==Pratt&#x27;s sapping campaign==
In December 1860, Major-General Pratt began operations against a major Māori defensive line called Te Arei (&quot;The barrier&quot;) on the west side of the Waitara River, barring the way to the historic hill pā of Pukerangiora. The principal defences were Kairau and Huirangi, skillfully engineered lines of rifle-pits, trenches and covered walkways. Backed with heavy artillery and a force of 900 men, Pratt advanced from Waitara on 29 December towards the Matarikoriko pā, between Puketakauere and the Waitara River, before building a redoubt on the old Kairau pā under heavy day-long fire from bush-covered rifle pits 150m away. Both sides exchanged heavy fire the next day, with British troops expending 70,000 rounds of rifle ammunition and 120 rounds of shot and shell and suffering three deaths and 20 wounded. The pā was captured on 31 December after being abandoned, and a stockade and blockhouses built on the site for a garrison of 60.

A second redoubt, No.2, was built in 11 hours on 14 January 500m past the Kairau redoubt and garrisoned by 120 men with artillery. Four days later, Pratt and a force of 1,000 moved out another 400m to build Redoubt No.3, which was garrisoned with 300 men and made the headquarters of the 40th Regiment.

At 3.30 am on 23 January 1861, No.3 Redoubt was stormed by a force of 140 warriors of Ngati Haua, Ngati Maniapoto, Waikato and Te Atiawa, led by Rewi Maniopoto, Epiha Tokohihi and Hapurona. Fierce fighting at close quarters, involving rifles, bayonets, shotgun, hand grenades and tomahawks, took place over the newly built parapet and in the boundary trench and lasted until daylight when British reinforcements arrived from Redoubt No.1. British losses in the fight were five killed and 11 wounded. Māori losses were estimated at 50.

From 22 January, the day before the attack on No.3 Redoubt, Pratt began employing the Royal Engineers to systematically apply the technique of sapping to advance towards Te Arei. Excavating through night and day under frequent fire, Pratt&#x27;s sap extended 768 yards and crossed the rifle pits of the Huirangi pā, prompting Māori to abandon the pā and fall back on Pukerangiora. Despite widespread criticism for his slow progress and caution, Pratt pressed on towards Te Arei, creating the most extensive field-engineering works ever undertaken by British troops in New Zealand. Five more redoubts were built as the saps continued to the edge of the cliff above the Waitara River, but ceased after the intervention of Kingite chief Wiremu Tamihana, who helped negotiate a truce. A ceasefire was formally effected on 18 March 1861, ending the first phase of the Taranaki War. For his actions on 18 March, Colour-Sergeant John Lucas was awarded the Victoria Cross.

By early 1861, settler opinion was evenly divided on Browne&#x27;s stance against Māori and the fairness of the Waitara purchase. Many believed the British had little hope of wearing the enemy down with further military campaigns. Even Pratt expressed doubts the war could be won. The district had also suffered great economic hardship, with immigration all but coming to a stop and the destruction of three-quarters of farmhouses at Omata, Bell Block, Tataraimaka, and settlements nearer the town.

==Casualties==

237 British soldiers were killed or wounded during the war, and 120 people had died due to disease in New Plymouth, due to the cramped conditions. Māori casualties were often exaggerated by colonial authorities, however at least 99 Māori died or were injured during the campaign, with most losses coming from Waikato Tainui (predominantly Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Hauā and Ngāti Mahuta). Ngāti Ruanui chief Te Rei Hanataua of the Tangahoe hapū, who was killed during the Battle of Waireka.

==Historical site preservation==

In June 2016 the New Plymouth District Council announced it had paid $715,000 to a private seller for Te Kohia Pa near Waitara. The council said it would work with Te Atiawa governance entity Te Kotahitanga o Te Atiawa on a development plan for the site that could include memorials, heritage and cultural tourism and educational developments. Mayor Andrew Judd said the site was regarded as an extension of the Puke Ariki museum. The pa&#x27;s exact location on the Devon Road site will be determined by archaeological investigations once a house on the land has been relocated. Although plans continue to be discussed the site remains undeveloped.

<doc id="235262" wikidata="Q2894569" url="?curid=235262" title="Frontline (American TV program)">
<text>Frontline (stylized in all capital letters) is an investigative documentary program distributed by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States. Episodes are produced at WGBH in Boston, Massachusetts. The series has covered a variety of domestic and international issues, including terrorism, elections, environmental disasters, and other sociopolitical issues. Since its debut in 1983, &quot;Frontline&quot; has aired in the U.S. for 42 seasons, and has won critical acclaim and awards in broadcast journalism. In 2024, &quot;Frontline&quot; won its first Oscar at the 96th Academy Awards for Best Documentary Feature, &quot;20 Days in Mariupol&quot;, made by a team of AP Ukrainian journalists. Frontline has produced over 800 documentaries from both in-house and independent filmmakers, 200 of which are available online.

==Format==
The program debuted in 1983, with NBC anchorwoman Jessica Savitch as the show&#x27;s first host, but Savitch died later after the first-season finale. &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;″s Judy Woodruff took over as host in 1984, and hosted the program for five years, combining her job with a sub-anchor place on &quot;The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour&quot; when Jim Lehrer was away. In 1990, episodes of &quot;Frontline&quot; began airing without a host, and the narrator was left to introduce each episode.

Most &quot;Frontline&quot; reports are an hour in length, but some are extended to 90 minutes, two hours, or beyond. &quot;Frontline&quot; also produces and transmits such occasional specials as &quot;From Jesus to Christ&quot;, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Wife&quot;, and &quot;Country Boys&quot;.

Since 1995, &quot;Frontline&quot; has been producing deep-content, companion web sites for all of its documentaries. The program publishes extended interview transcripts, in-depth chronologies, original essays, sidebar stories, related links and readings, and source documents including photographs and background research. &quot;Frontline&quot; has made many of its documentaries available via streaming Internet video, from its website.

Will Lyman is the distinctive voice who has narrated most of the installments of the program since its inception in 1983. However, certain reports have been narrated by David Ogden Stiers and Peter Berkrot or by correspondents who appear on screen.

=== &quot;The Choice&quot; ===
Since 1988, &quot;Frontline&quot; has also aired &quot;The Choice&quot;: a special edition aired during the lead-up to the presidential election every four years, focusing on the Democratic and Republican candidates contending for the office of President of the United States. An installment aired on October 14, 2008, using a dual-biography format for Barack Obama and John McCain. The 2008 documentary, produced by Michael Kirk, generated favorable reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which stated that the program helped viewers &quot;gain perspective&quot; about the &quot;idea-oriented campaign&quot;, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, which labeled it &quot;refreshingly clear&quot; and &quot;informative&quot;.

A subsequent episode aired on October 9, 2012, and featured the same dual biography tracing the lives and careers of incumbent President Barack Obama and his challenger, Mitt Romney. The following episode aired on September 27, 2016, and featured the biography of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. &quot;The Choice 2024&quot; is the most recent installment and aired on September 24, 2024, featuring Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

== Production ==
The show is produced by the WGBH Educational Foundation, the parent company of WGBH-TV in Boston, which is solely responsible for its content. WGBH is the creator of the Documentary Consortium, with another four PBS stations, including WNET in New York and KCTS in Seattle.

In 2015, the creator and founding executive producer of &quot;Frontline&quot;, David Fanning, retired after more than 32 years as executive producer of the program, and Raney Aronson-Rath succeeded him in senior grade. Fanning, however, remains editor-at-large of &quot;Frontline&quot; as a founding member.

On September 14, 2017, the program launched its first-ever podcast called &quot;The Frontline Dispatch&quot;. The podcast is a production of PBS and WGBH in Boston alongside PRX.

==&quot;Frontline/World&quot;==

&quot;Frontline/World&quot; is a spin-off program from &quot;Frontline&quot;, first transmitted on May 23, 2002, which was transmitted four to eight times a year on &quot;Frontline&quot; until it was canceled in 2010. It focused on issues from around the globe, and used a &quot;magazine&quot; format, where each hour-long episode typically had three stories that ran about 15 to 20 minutes in length. Its tagline was: &quot;Stories from a small planet&quot;.

Initially a co-production of WGBH, Boston and KQED, San Francisco, &quot;Frontline/World&quot; was later based in part at the University of California Berkeley&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism, where the program&#x27;s producers recruited a new generation of reporters and producers to the &quot;Frontline&quot; program.

&quot;Frontline/World&quot; also streamed stories on its website, which won two Webby awards in 2008 for its original program of online videos called &quot;Rough Cuts&quot;. In 2005, the Overseas Press Club of America gave the program its Edward R. Murrow Award for the best TV coverage of international events, citing producers David Fanning, Stephen Talbot, Sharon Tiller and Ken Dornstein. The program broke new ground in 2007 by winning two Emmys; one of these was for a broadcast story, &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Road to Hell&quot;, and the other was for an online video, &quot;Libya: Out of the Shadow&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Frontline&quot; has received generally positive reviews from television critics. David Zurawik of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote that the episode &quot;Inside the Meltdown&quot;, was &quot;one of the finest hours of non-fiction TV that I have seen.&quot; Vern Gay of &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that &quot;The Card Game&quot; episode, &quot;bores down to the hard, cold truth&quot; and is &quot;journalism at its best.&quot; Tom Brinkmoeller of &quot;TV Worth Watching&quot; called it, &quot;Indispensable.&quot; Sean Gregory of &quot;Time&quot; wrote about the episode, &quot;League of Denial&quot;, that it was &quot;a first-rate piece of reporting.&quot; David Zurawik of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote about the episode &quot;The Rise of ISIS&quot;, that it was &quot;superb and daring work.&quot; Alasdair Wilkins of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;hardest-hitting show on television.&quot; Margaret Sullivan, the media columnist of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote for the episode, &quot;The Choice 2016&quot;, &quot;utterly-fair and completely riveting.&quot; Vern Gay of &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that the show is &quot;authoritative and comprehensive.&quot; David Zurawik of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote that the episode &quot;Trump&#x27;s Showdown&quot;, &quot;is as good as long-form, non-fiction television gets.&quot; Chris Barton of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote for the episode, &quot;The Facebook Dilemma&quot; that &quot;Frontline&quot; has a &quot;well-earned reputation for unflinching, in-depth examinations of social issues and current events.&quot; &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; wrote for the episode, &quot;The Choice 2020&quot;, &quot;Beyond spin...thoughtful [and] in-depth.&quot;

==Awards and results==
Other &quot;Frontline&quot; reports focus on political, social, and criminal justice issues. Ofra Bikel, who has been a producer for &quot;Frontline&quot; since the first season, has produced a significant number of films on the criminal justice system in the United States. The films have focused on issues ranging from post-conviction DNA testing, the use of drug snitches and mandatory minimum sentencing laws, the plea system, and the use of eyewitness testimony. As a result of the films, 13 people have been released from prison.

After the September 11 attacks, the White House requested a copy of &quot;Hunting Bin Laden&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Frontline&quot; had produced this in-depth report about Osama bin Laden and the terrorist network that would come to be known as Al-Qaeda in the wake of the 1998 United States embassy bombings. Following the September 11 attacks, &quot;Frontline&quot; produced a series of films about Al-Qaeda and the War on Terrorism. In 2002, the program was awarded the DuPont-Columbia gold baton for the seven films.

In 2003, &quot;Frontline&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; joined forces on &quot;A Dangerous Business&quot;, an investigation led by reporter Lowell Bergman into the cast iron pipe making industry and worker safety. OSHA officials credit the documentary and newspaper report with stimulating federal policy change on workplace safety. In 2004, the joint investigation was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.

Producer Michael Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Frontline&quot; documentaries have won multiple awards. These films include &quot;League of Denial: The NFL&#x27;s Concussion Crisis&quot; (Peabody Award, 2013), &quot;Cheney&#x27;s Law&quot; (Peabody Award, 2007), &quot;The Lost Year in Iraq&quot; (Emmy Award, 2006), &quot;The Torture Question&quot; (Emmy Award, 2005), &quot;The Kevorkian File&quot; (Emmy Award), and &quot;Waco: The Inside Story&quot; (Peabody Award).

Director Martin Smith has produced dozens of films for &quot;Frontline&quot;, and won both Emmy and Writers Guild of America awards. His 2000 film &quot;Drug Wars&quot; was the winner of the Outstanding Background/Analysis of a Single Current Story Emmy and the George Foster Peabody Award. Additionally, &quot;Separated: Children at the Border&quot;, for which he was writer and correspondent, also won a 2018 Peabody Award.

Other notable producers of multiple &quot;Frontline&quot; documentaries have included Sherry Jones, Marian Marzynski, Miri Navasky, Karen O&#x27;Connor, June Cross, Neil Docherty, Stephen Talbot, Raney Aronson-Rath, Rachel Dretzin, James Jacoby and Rick Young.

As of July 2016, &quot;Frontline&quot; has won a total of 75 Emmy Awards and 18 Peabody Awards. In 2020, &quot;Frontline&quot; was also awarded an Institutional Peabody Award.

In 2022, &quot;Frontline&quot; won four awards in the 43rd News and Documentary Emmy Awards.

<text>Eel Pie Island is an island in the River Thames at Twickenham in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It is on the maintained minimum head of water above the only lock on the Tideway and is accessible by boat or from the left (generally north) bank by footbridge. The island had a club that was a major venue for jazz and blues in the 1960s.

==Name and former names==
The name may have come from eel pies which were served by the inn on the island in the 19th century. Its earlier names chronologically were the Parish Ait and Twickenham Ait, the latter co-existing until at least the 1880s. Before the 19th century it was for many centuries three parts – the core of each safely above high water, if not narrowly separate which a map of 1607 figures them as.

==History==
===Early history===
Some mesolithic red deer antler bone hand-made implements have been retrieved from the island&#x27;s shore.

===Eel Pie House===
An inn was on the Ait by 1743 and in the 19th century it was a popular stopping point for steamer excursions. When a new inn was built in 1830 to replace it, the former venue was alternatively called a &quot;dingy wooden cottage&quot; or an &quot;unassuming but popular little barn&quot;.

Samuel Lewis&#x27;s national gazetteer of 1848 devotes a large minority of the text covering Twickenham to the island; saying it is: 

===Extent and access===
The ait is recorded in at least two distinct parts in detailed maps until the end of the 19th century; the west part was built up in height and measured . Its named features were a large Boat House, the Island Hotel, a bowling green in the west and the Thames Electric &amp; Steam Launch Works. The east end is marked with marsh plantation and &quot;liable to flood&quot;; it was in the same maps measured at . Together the parts form the same isle as today.

A bridge was proposed to Middlesex County Council or the Metropolitan Borough of Twickenham in 1889. A set of rope pulleys operated in the early 20th century for assisting transporting light goods. It was not until 1957 that the first bridge to the ait was built.

===Eel Pie Island Hotel===
The island was the site of the Eel Pie Island Hotel, originally a genteel 19th-century three-storey building that later hosted ballroom dancing during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1956, trumpeter Brian Rutland, who ran a local band called The Grove Jazz Band, started jazz sessions at the newly reopened hotel. Some time afterwards, Arthur Chisnall took over the running of the club and continued to promote various jazz bands and then, in the 1960s, rock and R&amp;B groups.

Famous names who performed at the dance hall between 1957 and 1967 include:

*Long John Baldry&#x27;s Hoochie Coochie Men (including Rod Stewart)
*Acker Bilk
*Ken Colyer
*Cyril Davies Rhythm &amp; Blues All Stars
*The Downliners Sect
*John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers (featuring Eric Clapton)
*George Melly
*The Rolling Stones
*Screaming Lord Sutch
*The Tridents (featuring Jeff Beck)
*The Who
*The Yardbirds
*Pink Floyd

In 1967, the hotel was forced to close because the owner could not meet the £200,000 cost of repairs demanded by police. In 1969, the club briefly reopened as Colonel Barefoot&#x27;s Rock Garden, with bands such as Black Sabbath, The Edgar Broughton Band, Stray, Genesis, and Hawkwind (then known as Hawkwind Zoo) performing there.

Caldwell Smythe (entrepreneur, vocalist, ex-Riot Squad and, briefly, The Honeycombs) said: &quot;I approached the owner, Mr Snapper, who lived in Kingston and we agreed a rental deal. I called it Colonel Barefoot&#x27;s Rock Garden and plastered west London with quad crown posters.&quot; Smythe booked bands such as Edgar Broughton, Free, Deep Purple, King Crimson, Genesis, Wishbone Ash and Mott The Hoople. Smythe said: &quot;There were two stages: the headliner was on the big stage and the support on the small stage with the light show projectionist above it. We had a bar doing tea, soft drinks, hot dogs and hamburgers. We then did Colonel Barefoot&#x27;s Killer Punch (cider, cooking brandy and cinnamon) and we gave it away along with beer in half pint plastic disposable cups. I had rows with the fire department as the emergency exits were chained shut to stop people bunking in. Eventually, after a raid by the Fire Chief, I closed down and walked. I was living in Chiswick at this time.&quot;

In 1969, the hotel was occupied by a small group of local anarchists including illustrator Clifford Harper. By 1970 the Eel Pie Island Commune had become the UK&#x27;s largest hippie commune.

The building had by now fallen into disrepair and was placed under a demolition order. However, in 1971 the Eel Pie Island Hotel burned down in a mysterious fire.

The centre of the island was devastated by fire in 1996, and a year later, the only footbridge to the island was damaged by a utilities contractor. A new footbridge opened in August 1998.

==Description and uses==
The island has about 50 homes, 120 inhabitants and two or three boatyards, as well as some other small businesses and artists&#x27; studios. It has nature reserves at both ends, protected from public access. All plots and walkways are privately owned. The public can access a foreshortened central path, blocked by fences and front gardens from any river views.

===Artists===
For brief periods each year, usually in June and December, 26 studios in and around a working boatyard, collectively known as Eel Pie Island Art Studios, open to the public, enabling them to enjoy and buy the artists&#x27; works.

===Sport===

The island is home to Twickenham Rowing Club, one of the oldest rowing clubs on the Thames, and Richmond Yacht Club.

The island hosts the headquarters of the Parkrun organisation, which was founded in Bushy Park.

The Eel Pie Studios, also known as the Oceanic Studios, occupies The Boathouse, Twickenham on the mainland about a mile to the north. When owned by Pete Townshend it was adapted and used for international top 100-charting pop and rock recordings. Townshend&#x27;s publishing company, Eel Pie Publishing, is also named after the ait.

The Eel Pie pub-restaurant in Church Street, Twickenham is named after the former hotel on the island.

<text>The confederation of Cinque Ports ( ) is a historic group of coastal towns in south-east England – predominantly in Kent and Sussex, with one outlier (Brightlingsea) in Essex. The name is Old French, meaning &quot;five harbours&quot;, and alludes to the original five members (Hastings, New Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich). At its peak in the Late Middle Ages, the confederation included over 40 members. There is now a total of 14 members: five &quot;head ports&quot;, two &quot;ancient towns&quot; and seven &quot;limbs&quot;.

The confederation was originally formed for military and trade purposes, but is now entirely ceremonial. The ports lie on the western shore of the English Channel, where the crossing to the European continent is narrowest.

Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports are called &quot;Portsmen&quot;.

==Origins==
The origins of the confederation are obscure, but are believed to lie in the late Anglo-Saxon period, and specifically in the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066). Certain south-eastern ports were granted the local profits of justice in return for providing ships. The ship service of Romney, Dover and Sandwich (but not the confederation itself) is noted in Domesday Book (1086). By 1135, the term Cinque Ports had come into use; and in 1155 a royal charter established the ports to maintain ships ready for the Crown in case of need. The earliest general charter granting liberties to the ports in common dates from 1260. Their liberties are also mentioned in the Magna Carta of 1297 (clause 9). The chief obligation laid on the ports, as a corporate duty, was to provide 57 ships for 15 days&#x27; service to the king annually, each port fulfilling a proportion of the whole duty. 

It is sometimes said that the rationale behind the granting of privileges, and their maintenance and extension over several centuries, was the need for the Crown to have a guaranteed supply of men and ships in time of war, and that the Cinque Ports therefore played an important role in the development of the Royal Navy. N. A. M. Rodger questions whether the arrangement was ever intended to raise any genuinely effective naval provision, and shows that the Cinque Ports did not contribute to English strength at sea significantly more than other English ports of similar size. He argues rather that the original privileges may have been granted by Edward the Confessor out of a need to purchase the loyalty of a group of potentially troublesome ports that were of strategic importance to the control of cross-Channel traffic. Notwithstanding this, in the 13th and 14th centuries the ports did play a significant role in the defence of the realm, although their importance declined thereafter.

==Membership==
===Head Ports===
The original five ports were:
*Hastings
*New Romney
*Hythe
*Dover
*Sandwich

In medieval documents, Hastings sometimes appears to be given precedence among the ports (for example, the charters granted to Rye and Winchelsea by Henry II in 1155 refer to &quot;The Barons of Hastings and the Cinque Ports&quot;); but this usage probably arose simply from geographical convenience, with the ports being conventionally listed in order from west to east.

====Ancient Towns====
By 1190, two further towns had joined the confederation, originally to assist Hastings in her provision of ships. In time they grew in prosperity, and by the 14th century were recognised as having the same &quot;head port&quot; status as the original five ports. In deference to the literal meaning of &quot;Cinque Ports&quot;, however, these two additional members were always distinguished under the title of the &quot;Ancient Towns&quot; (often spelled &quot;Antient Towns&quot;). The confederation is therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;The five Cinque Ports and two Ancient Towns&quot;. The Ancient Towns were: 
*Winchelsea
*Rye

===Limbs===
Over the years, a number of further towns and ports joined the confederation as detached &quot;Limbs&quot; or &quot;Members&quot; (the terms are used interchangeably) of the seven head ports: they took a share in the burden of ship service, and a share in the privileges of the confederation. The limbs were often distinguished as either &quot;corporate limbs&quot;, whose status was confirmed by royal charter, and which enjoyed a considerable degree of self-government, or &quot;non-corporate limbs&quot;, which were more heavily dependent on, and governed by, their head port.

====Corporate limbs====
The corporate limbs were:
*Pevensey (limb of Hastings)
*Seaford (limb of Hastings)
*Tenterden (limb of Rye)
*Lydd (limb of New Romney)
*Folkestone (limb of Dover)
*Faversham (limb of Dover)
*Fordwich (limb of Sandwich)
*Deal (limb of Sandwich; originally a non-corporate limb, but incorporated in 1699)

====Non-corporate limbs==== 
Non-corporate limbs have at various dates included:
* Limbs of Hastings: Grange (now part of Gillingham, Kent), Bekesbourne, Bulverhythe, Northeye (former village in Sussex), Eastbourne, Hydney (now Hampden Park, part of Eastbourne), Pebsham (small village between Bulverhythe and Bexhill-on-Sea [then as Bexhill]), and Petit Iham (settlement near Winchelsea)
* Limbs of New Romney: Old Romney, Bromehill (near Winchelsea), Dengemarsh, and Orwaldstone
* Limb of Hythe: West Hythe
* Limbs of Dover: Margate, St Johns (part of Margate), Goresend (now Birchington), Birchington Wood (now Woodchurch), St Peters, Ringwould, and Kingsdown
* Limbs of Sandwich: Reculver, Sarre, Walmer, Stonar (near Richborough), Ramsgate, and Brightlingsea (in Essex)

====Current limbs====
Many of the historic members of the confederation have now either ceased to exist as a result of coastal change, or have shrunk or lost status for other reasons. The following are the current limbs of the confederation:
*Tenterden (limb of Rye)
*Lydd (limb of New Romney)
*Folkestone (limb of Dover)
*Faversham (limb of Dover)
*Margate (limbs of Dover)
*Deal (limb of Sandwich)
*Ramsgate (limb of Sandwich)

==Privileges==
In return for their ship service, the towns received various privileges, including:
*Exemption from tax and tallage
*Rights of sac and soc [jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases within their liberties]
*Rights of toll and team [authority over the sale or passage of cattle and other property within their liberties]
*Rights of bloodwit and fledwit [authority to punish shedders of blood, and those seized in an attempt to escape justice]
*Rights of pillory and tumbril [authority to punish delinquents]
*Rights of infangthief and outfangthief [authority to imprison or execute thieves or other felons]
*The right of mundbryce [the right to enter private property in order to erect banks or dikes as a defence against the sea]
*Rights of waifs and strays [the right to appropriate unclaimed property and stray animals]
*Rights of flotsam, jetsam and ligan [the right to appropriate the debris and cargo of wrecked ships]

This means that in effect they were granted a degree of self-government, legal jurisdiction, and financial advantage. In many respects, the confederation was considered to hold a status equivalent to that of a shire.

From an early date (the 13th century) representatives of the ports sat in Parliament. The practice had been regularised by the end of the 14th century, with the five head ports and two ancient towns, and one corporate limb (Seaford), each being entitled to send two Members to Parliament.

==Institutions==
Many of the Portsmen were fishermen, and in pursuit of herring sailed annually to the Norfolk coast, where they claimed rights of &quot;den and strand&quot; on the sandbank at the mouth of the River Yare. The settlement there gradually developed into the town of Yarmouth. The ports therefore became closely involved in the regulation of the annual autumn Herring Fair at Yarmouth, and this was probably the main incentive for the individual ports to work together collectively in confederation.

A Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports was appointed, an office frequently, and by the end of the 13th century permanently, combined with that of Constable of Dover Castle. The joint office survives to the present day, but is now a purely honorary title, with an official residence at Walmer Castle. 

The confederation had its own system of assemblies and common courts:

*The court of Shepway is first mentioned in the late 12th century. It was a local royal court of justice (effectively the equivalent of an eyre court), presided over by an officer of the Crown, and linked the confederation to central government. It met at Shepway Cross, near Lympne, where officers of the various members of the confederation were summoned to attend. The court met at irregular intervals, and over the course of the 15th century appears to have fallen into a slow decline. By the early 17th century it had effectively ceased to function. Nevertheless, it continued to hold a nominal existence, as it was at special sessions of the court that the Lord Warden was installed in office. The court of 1598, summoned for the installation as Warden of Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham, was held at his manor of Bekesbourne; and in the late 17th century the court was moved to Dover. The approximate site of the original meeting place is now marked by a war memorial erected in 1923, also known as Shepway Cross.

*The Brodhull was a general assembly for representatives of the five head ports and two ancient towns. &quot;Brodhull&quot; is thought to have been originally a place-name, and presumably the original place of meeting, close to Dymchurch. The assembly subsequently met in Dymchurch, but after 1357 came to meet regularly in New Romney. One of the principal tasks of the Brodhull was the supervision of the Yarmouth Fair, and the appointment of bailiffs to manage it. By 1432 it met regularly twice a year. Meetings followed a parliamentary pattern, and were presided over by a &quot;Speaker&quot;: the speakership changed on 21 May each year, the right of appointment moving from port to port in geographical order from west to east. In the 15th and 16th centuries the name &quot;Brodhull&quot; gradually became corrupted (through false etymology) into &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, and in the post-medieval period the court was more usually known as the Brotherhood.

*The Guestling appears to have originated as a local meeting of the west ports (Hastings, Winchelsea and Rye, and perhaps their limbs). It probably took its name from the village of Guestling, a few miles west of Winchelsea, which may have been its original meeting-place. Over the course of the 16th century it developed into a more general meeting of all the head ports, ancient towns and corporate limbs, usually held annually and often in conjunction with the Brotherhood. As it represented a larger group of ports than the Brotherhood, it eventually became the pre-eminent assembly. However, in 1663 the Yarmouth service was suspended indefinitely, and thereafter both the Brotherhood and the Guestling fell into decline. The two courts continue to hold a nominal existence, but since 1866 have been held jointly.

===Barons===

All Freemen of the ports, termed &quot;Portsmen&quot;, were deemed in the age of feudalism to be barons, and thus members of the baronage entitled to attend the king&#x27;s parliament – a privilege granted in 1322 in recognition of their earlier support of the Despensers, father and son. Termed &quot;Barons of the Cinque Ports&quot;, they reflected an early concept that military service at sea constituted land tenure making them &quot;quasi&quot; feudal barons. The early-14th-century treatise &quot;Modus Tenendi Parliamentum&quot; stated the Barons of the Cinque Ports to hold a place of precedence below the lay magnates (Lords Temporal) but above the representatives of the shires and boroughs (Knights of the Shire and burgesses). During the deposition of Edward II, the chronicles made a specific point of noting the presence of the Barons in the embassy of deposition – &quot;praecipue de portubus ... barones des Portez&quot; (&quot;especially the [Cinque] Ports ... the barones of the Ports&quot;). Writs of summons to parliament were sent to the warden following which representative barons of the Cinque Ports were selected to attend parliament. Thus the warden&#x27;s duty in this respect was similar to that of the sheriff who received the writs for distribution to the barons in the shires. The existence of common (i.e. communal) seals of the barons of the individual ports (see illustration) suggests they formed a corporation as the seal was designed to be affixed to charters and legal documents which would bind them as a single body. This no doubt related to their privileges as monopolies. The warden and barons often experienced clashes of jurisdiction.

In the 21st century the title &quot;Baron of the Cinque Ports&quot; is now reserved for Freemen elected by the Mayor, Jurats and Common Council of the Ports to attend a coronation and is solely honorary in nature. &quot;Since time immemorial&quot;, the barons had held the right to hold a canopy above the monarch during the procession on foot between Westminster Hall and Westminster Abbey. This procession was discontinued after the Coronation of George IV in 1821, but for the Coronation of Edward VII in 1902 the barons were found a new role. They were to process inside the abbey as far as the choir and there receive the banners of the monarch&#x27;s realms, a function which they have repeated at all the 20th-century coronations. For the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla in 2023, fourteen barons joined the congregation in the abbey, representing the original five ports, the two ancient towns and the seven limbs.

==Decline==

The continuing decline of the confederation of the Cinque Ports may be ascribed to a variety of different circumstances. While they survived the raids from the Danes and the French, the numerous destructive impact of plagues, and the politics of the 13th-century Plantagenets and the subsequent War of the Roses, natural causes such as the silting of harbours and the withdrawal of the sea did much to undermine them. The rise of Southampton, and the need for larger ships than could be crewed by the 21-man service of the ports, also contributed to the decline.

Although by the 14th century the confederation faced wider challenges from a greater consolidation of national identity in the monarchy and Parliament, the legacy of the Saxon authority remained. Even after the 15th century, the Ancient Towns continued to serve with the supply of transport ships.

During the 15th century, New Romney, once a port of great importance at the mouth of the river Rother (until it became completely blocked by the shifting of sands during the South England flood of February 1287), was considered the central port in the confederation, and the place of assembly for the courts of Shepway and Brodhull.

Much of Hastings was washed away by the sea in the 13th century. During a naval campaign of 1339, and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and went into a decline during which it ceased to be a major port. It had no natural sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of Elizabeth I, but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in storms.

New Romney is now about a mile and a half from the seafront. It was originally a harbour town at the mouth of the River Rother. The Rother estuary was always difficult to navigate, with many shallow channels and sandbanks. In the latter part of the thirteenth century a series of severe storms weakened the coastal defences of Romney Marsh, and the South England flood of February 1287 almost destroyed the town. The harbour and town were filled with sand, silt, mud and debris, and the River Rother changed course, now running out into the sea near Rye, Sussex. New Romney ceased to be a port.

Hythe is still on the coast. However, although it is beside a broad bay, its natural harbour has been removed by centuries of silting.

Dover is still a major port.

Sandwich is now from the sea and no longer a port.

Ongoing changes in the coastline along the south east coast, from the Thames estuary to Hastings and the Isle of Wight inevitably reduced the significance of a number of the Cinque port towns as port authorities. However, ship building and repair, fishing, piloting, off shore rescue and sometimes even &quot;wrecking&quot; continued to play a large part in the activities of the local community.

By the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the Cinque Ports had effectively ceased to be of any great significance, and were absorbed into the general administration of the realm. Queen Elizabeth I sanctioned the first national lottery that was held in 1569 in an effort to raise funds for the crumbling Cinque Ports. Nevertheless, in 1689 the Cinque ports were among those specifically called following the Glorious Revolution to elect representatives to attend the Convention Parliament which enacted the English Bill of Rights. 

With the advance in shipbuilding techniques came a growth in towns such as Bristol and Liverpool and the wider development of ports such as London, Gravesend, Southampton, Chichester, Plymouth and the royal dockyards of Chatham, Portsmouth, Greenwich, Woolwich and Deptford. A further reason for the decline of many older ports may be ascribed to the development of the canal, turnpike and railway networks across Britain, and the increased quantity of overseas trade these could distribute from the new major ports developing from the 18th century.

Local government reforms and Acts of Parliament passed during the 19th and 20th centuries (notably the Reform Act 1832) have eroded the administrative and judicial powers of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports, when New Romney and Winchelsea were disenfranchised from Parliament, with representation provided through their counties alone, while Hythe and Rye&#x27;s representation was halved.

In 1985, HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; established an affiliation with the Cinque Ports. In 2005, the affiliation was changed to HMS &quot;Kent&quot;.

==Records==
The early history of the confederation is poorly documented, and can generally be traced only through incidental mentions in the charters granted to individual ports, or in other external records. One important early document, first compiled in the 13th century, but which survives only in the form of later and variant copies, is the so-called &quot;Domesday of the Ports&quot;, a list of the then-members of the confederation and the services they owed.

The confederation&#x27;s activities are much better documented from 1432 onwards, when minutes of the proceedings of the Brotherhood and Guestling began to be taken consistently. Meetings are documented in two books, known respectively as the &quot;White Book&quot; (covering the years 1432 to 1571, although the earliest portion, to 1485, comprises a transcript made in 1560) and the &quot;Black Book&quot; (covering the years 1572 to 1955). The White and Black Books were held at New Romney until 1960, when they were transferred to the Kent Archives Office (now the Kent History and Library Centre) in Maidstone. A comprehensive calendar of the two books was published in 1966.

==Heraldry==

The traditional coat of arms of the confederation is a shield divided per pale (vertically), depicting on the dexter side (viewer&#x27;s left) three gold half lions passant gardant on a red field; and on the sinister side (viewer&#x27;s right) three gold half ships&#x27; hulls on a blue field. These arms are also flown as an heraldic banner (flag), and form the basis of the banner of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The earliest certain evidence for the use of the arms is on a common seal of Dover dating from 1305, but they also appear on the common seal of Hastings which may be a few years earlier. They are thought to have been first introduced in 1297.

There has long been an assumption that the arms were created through a process of heraldic dimidiation – that is to say, by combining half of the royal arms of England (the three lions) with half of an unidentified coat of arms depicting three ships. However, none of the earliest representations of the arms (all on seals) show the vertical partition of the field, suggesting that it was originally of only one colour. It therefore appears more likely that, while certainly alluding to the royal arms, the arms of the Cinque Ports were devised from the outset as a design depicting three half-lion-half-ships, probably on a red field; and that only at a later date, probably in the mid-14th century, was the field partitioned into two colours.

There has historically been some confusion as to whether the three ships should be depicted as gold (&quot;&quot;or&quot;) or silver (&quot;argent&quot;&quot;): both variants are found in reputable heraldic sources from the late middle ages to the 19th century. The modern consensus is to depict them as gold in the confederation arms, although silver ships appear in some of the derivative arms borne by individual member ports.
The traditional arms and banner may only officially and lawfully be displayed by representatives of the confederation itself, or by the local authorities for its member ports. However, in 2017 the Cinque Ports Authority registered with the UK Flag Registry a flag of three gold ships&#x27; hulls on a blue field as a &quot;regional&quot; or &quot;community&quot; flag, which may be flown by anyone who wishes to express identity with the Cinque Ports.

Several of the member ports have their own coats of arms, which in some cases are modified or derivative versions of the confederation arms. Thus, Sandwich bears arms identical to those of the confederation, but with the three ships&#x27; hulls silver. Hastings bears a variant on which the central half-lion-half-ship is replaced by a full lion, and the two ships&#x27; hulls are silver. Deal bears a version of the confederation arms differenced by a chief on which the Lord Warden&#x27;s &quot;oar of Admiralty&quot; appears. New Romney bears three gold lions on a blue field. Others incorporate elements from the confederation arms, or otherwise allude to them. Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, never a member of the confederation but closely associated with it through its herring fishery and fair, bears a variant on which the three half-ships are replaced by three fishes&#x27; tails.

<doc id="235281" wikidata="Q1141187" url="?curid=235281" title="Piano Sonata No. 12 (Mozart)">
<text>The Piano Sonata No. 12 in F major, K. 332 (300k) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was published in 1784 along with the Piano Sonata No. 10 in C major, K. 330, and Piano Sonata No. 11, K. 331. Mozart wrote these sonatas either while visiting Munich in 1781, or during his first two years in Vienna. Some believe, however that Mozart wrote this and the other sonatas during a summer 1783 visit to Salzburg made for the purpose of introducing his wife, Constanze to his father, Leopold. All three sonatas were published in Vienna in 1784 as Mozart&#x27;s Op. 6.

==Movements==
The sonata consists of three movements and takes approximately 18 minutes to perform (25 minutes with repeats).

The first movement is in a classical sonata form, with repeats for the exposition, the development and recapitulation. There are two basic characteristics exemplified in the first movement: the song-like themes and the combination of styles. Mozart uses diverse styles including galant homophony, learned counterpoint, and even the intense &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; style.

The first theme of the exposition begins with a right hand melody over a left hand Alberti bass figure. Next, there is a short melody with the left hand echoing it, while the right hand plays a two-part phrase that includes a Mordent. Immediately following thereafter is parallel motion in both hands in very similar rhythm. A sudden change follows, with the F major key changing into the relative minor key, D minor at measure 23. The second theme (m. 41) begins in the dominant key of C major, is in galant style, and is immediately restated in varied form (m. 49). The remainder of the exposition includes many forte piano dynamics, hemiolas, parallel thirds in the right hand, trills in the right hand, and left hand octaves and broken chords. The exposition ends at measure 93 in C major.

The development section begins at measure 94 with a new melody, focusing on the transitional passage between the second and closing themes in the exposition. As in the exposition, the development includes strikingly similar musical characteristics such as the contrasting forte piano dynamics, hemiolas, left hand octaves, and parallel thirds in the right hand.

The first movement concludes with the recapitulation starting at measure 133, where the first thematic area returns unchanged, the transition modulates to distant harmonies yet closes on the tonic, and the remainder of the exposition returns, transposed into the tonic.

In the 1923 novel &quot;Antic Hay&quot; by Aldous Huxley, this sonata is the one Gumbril thinks of every time he imagines Emily&#x27;s body; from his description of the key sequence, he is thinking specifically of the first movement.

The second movement is in B-flat major in an elaborately ornamented sonatina form. At the beginning, there is a melody accompanied by an Alberti bass figure in the left hand. The next phrase is the same, except the key immediately changes to the parallel minor, B-flat minor. A lyrical passage with a minor descending scale ends with the dominant key. The music then turns happy and joyful, until the end, when the phrases end with a dominant seventh chord of B-flat major, which resolves into the first degree.

In the 1994 film &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;, Giulietta Guicciardi is heard playing this piece during a piano lesson with Ludwig van Beethoven.

The last movement is a rollicking virtuoso movement in time signature in the key of F major. It starts with a forte chord and is followed by a passage of fast 16th notes in the right hand. This is directly followed by parallel sixths between the left hand and right hand lower voice, creating a harmony contrasting to the opening single 16th-note passage. There is a change of character in measure 16 where the music is marked  &quot;dolce&quot; and the right hand has a simple melody embellished with ornamentation and back-and-forth contrasting legato to staccato articulations. Measure 22 displays yet another character change, where both hands are playing in unison (one octave apart) forte and staccato while moving in an ascending sixth sequential pattern. The music briefly modulates to D minor through octaves and broken chord patterns. This is then followed by C major (measures 41–49), and then C minor (measures 50–64), before coming back to C major at measure 65 and staying in the dominant key through the end of the exposition. Throughout the entire exposition, Mozart uses the model sequence technique, passages of broken chords, parallel motion, scales, and contrasting dynamics and articulations.

The development section begins at measure 91, restating the theme from the exposition, but in C minor. The first half of the development uses the model sequence technique, repeating a 4-measure idea of continuous 16th notes constructed of a descending scale, followed by parallel sixths between the left and right hand lower voice, followed by a broken dominant seventh chord. This section goes through modulations from C minor, to D major, G major, C major again, F major, and then finally to B major beginning at measure 112. The second half of the development section (starting at measure 112) presents a new melodic theme, followed by several broken chords before finally arriving at a dominant chord at measure 139. It is implied that the music is &#x27;standing on the dominant&#x27; from measure 139 until the recapitulation returns at measure 148, ending on a perfect authentic cadence.

The recapitulation presents the first theme unaltered until measure 169. The remaining recapitulation presents the same thematic ideas as the exposition, just in slightly altered versions. It concludes with a pianissimo cadence, strikingly different in comparison to the opening of the movement.

<text>An appoggiatura ( , ; or ; ) is a musical ornament that consists of an added non-chord note in a melody that is resolved to the regular note of the chord. By putting the non-chord tone on a strong beat, (typically the first or third beats of the measure, in 4/4 time) this accents the appoggiatura note, which also delays the appearance of the principal, expected chord note. The added non-chord note, or auxiliary note, is typically one degree higher or lower than the principal note, and may be chromatically altered. An appoggiatura may be added to a melody in a vocal song or in an instrumental work.

The term comes from the Italian verb , &quot;to lean upon&quot;. The appoggiatura is often used to express emotional &quot;yearning&quot;. It is also called a long appoggiatura to distinguish it from the short appoggiatura, the acciaccatura. An ascending appoggiatura was previously known as a forefall, while a descending appoggiatura was known as a backfall.

==Notation==

The appoggiatura is often written as a grace note prefixed to a principal note and printed in small character, usually without the oblique stroke:

:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature
#&#x27;stencil = ##f
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 2/4
 \grace { d4( } c2)
}
&lt;/score&gt;

This may be executed as follows:

:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature
#&#x27;stencil = ##f
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 2/4
 d4( c)
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The same notation can be used for other interpretations of the grace note; therefore determining that an appoggiatura is intended depends on performance practice.

An appoggiatura may also be notated precisely as it should be performed, with full-size notes, to reduce ambiguity.

==Unaccented appoggiatura==

So-called &quot;unaccented appoggiaturas&quot; are also quite common in many periods of music, even though they are disapproved of by some early theorists (for example, by C. P. E. Bach, in his &quot;&quot;). While not being identical with the acciaccatura, these are almost always quite short, and take their time from the allocation for the note that precedes them. They are more likely to be seen as full-size notes in the score, rather than in small character – at least in modern editions.

==Double appoggiatura==

The double appoggiatura (Ital. &quot;Appoggiatura doppia&quot;; Ger. &quot;Doppelvorschlag&quot;; Fr. &quot;Port de voix double&quot;) is an ornament composed of two short notes preceding a principal note, one placed above and the other below it. They are usually written as small sixteenth notes.

The first of the two may be at any distance from the principal note, but the second is only one degree removed from it. They have no fixed duration, but are generally slower when applied to a long note (Ex. 1) than when the principal note is short (Ex. 2); moreover, the double appoggiatura, in which the first note lies at a distance from the principal note, should always be somewhat slower than that in which both notes are close to it (Ex. 3). In all cases, the time required for both notes is subtracted from the value of the principal note.

:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
{ \new PianoStaff « 
 \new Staff { \relative c&quot; {
 \clef treble \time 2/4
 \grace { b16(^\markup { 1. Written } d } c2) \bar &quot;||&quot;
 \grace { b16(^\markup { 2. } d } c4) b8 r8 \bar &quot;||&quot;
 \grace { e,16(^\markup { 3. } d&#x27; } c4) b8 r8 \bar &quot;||&quot;}
 \new Staff { \relative c&quot; {
 \tuplet 3/2 { b16(^\markup { Played } d c~ } c8~ c4)
 b32( d32 c8. b8) r8 
 \tuplet 3/2 { e,16( d&#x27; c~ } c8 b8) r8 }
» } } 
&lt;/score&gt;

The double appoggiatura is sometimes, though rarely, met with in an inverted form (Ex. 4), and C. P. E. Bach mentions another exceptional kind, in which the first of the two small notes is dotted, and receives the whole accent, while the principal note becomes as short as the second of the two small notes (Ex. 5)

:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
{ \new PianoStaff « 
 \new Staff { \relative c&quot; {
 \clef treble \time 1/4 
 \grace { d16(^\markup { 4. } b } c4) \bar &quot;||&quot;
 \time 3/4
 c4^\markup { 5. } \grace { c8.( e16 } d4) c \bar &quot;||&quot; }
 \new Staff { \relative c&quot; {
 d32( b c8.)
 c4 c8.( e32 d) c4 }
» } } 
&lt;/score&gt;

The dotted double appoggiatura, written as above, is of very rare occurrence.

== Appoggiaturas approached by step ==

Although appoggiaturas are often approached by leap and resolved by step, there are examples of approach and resolution both taking place by step.

One such example is present in Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Wiegenlied&quot; D. 867:
== Examples in popular music ==
Appoggiaturias can also be found in many popular songs as they grab a listener&#x27;s attention especially when placed in the vocal melody.

Beatles&#x27; songs that make use of this technique (appoggiaturias underlined in the sung syllables below):

&quot;Yesterday&quot;:

&quot;Yes - ter - day, all my troubles seemed so far away.&quot;

&quot;Now it looks as though they&#x27;re here to stay...&quot;

<doc id="235287" wikidata="Q207843" url="?curid=235287" title="Nitric oxide">
<text>Nitric oxide (nitrogen oxide or nitrogen monoxide) is a colorless gas with the formula . It is one of the principal oxides of nitrogen. Nitric oxide is a free radical: it has an unpaired electron, which is sometimes denoted by a dot in its chemical formula (•N=O or •NO). Nitric oxide is also a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, a class of molecules whose study spawned early modern theories of chemical bonding.

An important intermediate in industrial chemistry, nitric oxide forms in combustion systems and can be generated by lightning in thunderstorms. In mammals, including humans, nitric oxide is a signaling molecule in many physiological and pathological processes. It was proclaimed the &quot;Molecule of the Year&quot; in 1992. The 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded for discovering nitric oxide&#x27;s role as a cardiovascular signalling molecule. Its impact extends beyond biology, with applications in medicine, such as the development of sildenafil (Viagra), and in industry, including semiconductor manufacturing.

Nitric oxide should not be confused with nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a brown gas and major air pollutant, or with nitrous oxide (N2O), an anesthetic gas.

==History==

Nitric oxide (NO) was first identified by Joseph Priestley in the late 18th century, originally seen as merely a toxic byproduct of combustion and an environmental pollutant. Its biological significance was later uncovered in the 1980s when researchers Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro, and Ferid Murad discovered its critical role as a vasodilator in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough that earned them the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. 

==Physical properties==
===Electronic configuration===

The ground state electronic configuration of NO is, in united atom notation:

formula_1

The first two orbitals are actually pure atomic 1&quot;s&quot;O and 1&quot;s&quot;N from oxygen and nitrogen respectively and therefore are usually not noted in the united atom notation. Orbitals noted with an asterisk are antibonding. The ordering of 5σ and 1π according to their binding energies is subject to discussion. Removal of a 1π electron leads to 6 states whose energies span over a range starting at a lower level than a 5σ electron an extending to a higher level. This is due to the different orbital momentum couplings between a 1π and a 2π electron.

The lone electron in the 2π orbital makes NO a doublet (X ²Π) in its ground state whose degeneracy is split in the fine structure from spin-orbit coupling with a total momentum &quot;J&quot;= or &quot;J&quot;=.

===Dipole===

The dipole of NO has been measured experimentally to 0.15740 D and is oriented from O to N (⁻NO⁺) due to the transfer of negative electronic charge from oxygen to nitrogen.

==Reactions==
===With di- and triatomic molecules===
Upon condensing to a neat liquid, nitric oxide dimerizes to colorless dinitrogen dioxide (O=N–N=O), but the association is weak and reversible. The N–N distance in crystalline NO is 218 pm, nearly twice the N–O distance. Condensation in a highly polar environment instead gives the red alternant isomer O=N–O=N. 

Since the heat of formation of •NO is endothermic, NO can be decomposed to the elements. Catalytic converters in cars exploit this reaction:
: 2 •NO → O2 + N2

When exposed to oxygen, nitric oxide converts into nitrogen dioxide:
: 2 •NO + O2 → 2 •NO2

This reaction is thought to occur via the intermediates ONOO• and the red compound ONOONO.

In water, nitric oxide reacts with oxygen to form nitrous acid (HNO2). The reaction is thought to proceed via the following stoichiometry:

: 4 •NO + O2 + 2 H2O → 4 HNO2

Nitric oxide reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to form the nitrosyl halides, such as nitrosyl chloride:
: 2 •NO + Cl2 → 2 NOCl

With NO2, also a radical, NO combines to form the intensely blue dinitrogen trioxide:
: •NO + •NO2 ON−NO2

===Organic chemistry===

Nitric oxide rarely sees organic chemistry use. Most reactions with it produce complex mixtures of salts, separable only through careful recrystallization. 

The addition of a nitric oxide moiety to another molecule is often referred to as &quot;nitrosylation&quot;. The Traube reaction is the addition of a two equivalents of nitric oxide onto an enolate, giving a diazeniumdiolate (also called a &quot;nitrosohydroxylamine&quot;). The product can undergo a subsequent retro-aldol reaction, giving an overall process similar to the haloform reaction. For example, nitric oxide reacts with acetone and an alkoxide to form a diazeniumdiolate on each α position, with subsequent loss of methyl acetate as a by-product:

This reaction, which was discovered around 1898, remains of interest in nitric oxide prodrug research. Nitric oxide can also react directly with sodium methoxide, ultimately forming sodium formate and nitrous oxide by way of an &quot;N&quot;-methoxydiazeniumdiolate.

Sufficiently basic secondary amines undergo a Traube-like reaction to give NONOates. However, very few nucleophiles undergo the Traube reaction, either failing to adduce NO or immediately decomposing with nitrous oxide release.

===Coordination complexes===

Nitric oxide reacts with transition metals to give complexes called metal nitrosyls. The most common bonding mode of nitric oxide is the terminal linear type (M−NO). Alternatively, nitric oxide can serve as a one-electron pseudohalide. In such complexes, the M−N−O group is characterized by an angle between 120° and 140°. The NO group can also bridge between metal centers through the nitrogen atom in a variety of geometries.

==Production and preparation==
In commercial settings, nitric oxide is produced by the oxidation of ammonia at 750–900 °C (normally at 850 °C) with platinum as catalyst in the Ostwald process:

:4 NH3 + 5 O2 → 4 •NO + 6 H2O

The uncatalyzed endothermic reaction of oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2), which is effected at high temperature (&gt;2000 °C) by lightning has not been developed into a practical commercial synthesis (see Birkeland–Eyde process):
:N2 + O2 → 2 •NO

===Laboratory methods===
In the laboratory, nitric oxide is conveniently generated by reduction of dilute nitric acid with copper:
:8 HNO3 + 3 Cu → 3 Cu(NO3)2 + 4 H2O + 2 •NO

An alternative route involves the reduction of nitrous acid in the form of sodium nitrite or potassium nitrite:
: 2 NaNO2 + 2 NaI + 2 H2SO4 → I2 + 2 Na2SO4 + 2 H2O + 2 •NO
: 2 NaNO2 + 2 FeSO4 + 3 H2SO4 → Fe2(SO4)3 + 2 NaHSO4 + 2 H2O + 2 •NO
: 3 KNO2 + KNO3 + Cr2O3 → 2 K2CrO4 + 4 •NO

The iron(II) sulfate route is simple and has been used in undergraduate laboratory experiments. 

So-called NONOate compounds are also used for nitric oxide generation, especially in biological laboratories. However, other Traube adducts may decompose to instead give nitrous oxide.

==Detection and assay==
Nitric oxide concentration can be determined using a chemiluminescent reaction involving ozone. A sample containing nitric oxide is mixed with a large quantity of ozone. The nitric oxide reacts with the ozone to produce oxygen and nitrogen dioxide, accompanied with emission of light (chemiluminescence):
: •NO + O3 → •NO2 + O2 + &quot;hν&quot;
which can be measured with a photodetector. The amount of light produced is proportional to the amount of nitric oxide in the sample.

Other methods of testing include electroanalysis (amperometric approach), where ·NO reacts with an electrode to induce a current or voltage change. The detection of NO radicals in biological tissues is particularly difficult due to the short lifetime and concentration of these radicals in tissues. One of the few practical methods is spin trapping of nitric oxide with iron-dithiocarbamate complexes and subsequent detection of the mono-nitrosyl-iron complex with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR).

A group of fluorescent dye indicators that are also available in acetylated form for intracellular measurements exist. The most common compound is 4,5-diaminofluorescein (DAF-2).

== Environmental effects ==
=== Acid rain deposition ===
Nitric oxide reacts with the hydroperoxyl radical () to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which then can react with a hydroxyl radical (HO•) to produce nitric acid (HNO3):
: •NO + → •NO2 + HO•
: •NO2 + HO• → HNO3
Nitric acid, along with sulfuric acid, contributes to acid rain deposition.

=== Ozone depletion ===
•NO participates in ozone layer depletion. Nitric oxide reacts with stratospheric ozone to form O2 and nitrogen dioxide:
: •NO + O3 → •NO2 + O2

This reaction is also utilized to measure concentrations of •NO in control volumes.

=== Precursor to NO2 ===
As seen in the acid deposition section, nitric oxide can transform into nitrogen dioxide (this can happen with the hydroperoxy radical, , or diatomic oxygen, O2). Symptoms of short-term nitrogen dioxide exposure include nausea, dyspnea and headache. Long-term effects could include impaired immune and respiratory function.

==Biological functions==

NO is a gaseous signaling molecule. It is a key vertebrate biological messenger, playing a role in a variety of biological processes. It is a bioproduct in almost all types of organisms, including bacteria, plants, fungi, and animal cells.

Nitric oxide, an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), is biosynthesized endogenously from -arginine, oxygen, and NADPH by various nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes. Reduction of inorganic nitrate may also make nitric oxide. One of the main enzymatic targets of nitric oxide is guanylyl cyclase. The binding of nitric oxide to the heme region of the enzyme leads to activation, in the presence of iron. Nitric oxide is highly reactive (having a lifetime of a few seconds), yet diffuses freely across membranes. These attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient paracrine (between adjacent cells) and autocrine (within a single cell) signaling molecule. Once nitric oxide is converted to nitrates and nitrites by oxygen and water, cell signaling is deactivated.

The endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, resulting in vasodilation and increasing blood flow. Sildenafil (Viagra) is a drug that uses the nitric oxide pathway. Sildenafil does not produce nitric oxide, but enhances the signals that are downstream of the nitric oxide pathway by protecting cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, allowing for the signal to be enhanced, and thus vasodilation. Another endogenous gaseous transmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) works with NO to induce vasodilation and angiogenesis in a cooperative manner.

Nasal breathing produces nitric oxide within the body, while oral breathing does not.

== Occupational safety and health ==
In the U.S., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for nitric oxide exposure in the workplace as 25 ppm (30 mg/m3) over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 25 ppm (30 mg/m3) over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 100 ppm, nitric oxide is immediately dangerous to life and health.

== Explosion hazard ==
Liquid nitrogen oxide is very sensitive to detonation even in the absence of fuel, and can be initiated as readily as nitroglycerin. Detonation of the endothermic liquid oxide close to its b.p. (-152°C) generated a 100 kbar pulse and fragmented the test equipment. It is the simplest molecule that is capable of detonation in all three phases. The liquid oxide is sensitive and may explode during distillation, and this has been the cause of industrial accidents. Gaseous nitric oxide detonates at about 2300 m/s, but as a solid it can reach a detonation velocity of 6100 m/s.

<text>Courage Under Fire is a 1996 American war drama film directed by Edward Zwick, and starring Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan. It is the second collaboration between Washington and director Zwick. The film was released in the United States on July 12, 1996, to positive reviews and grossed $100 million worldwide.

==Plot==
While serving in the Persian Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling fires on and destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing nighttime battle, killing his friend, Lieutenant Tom Boylar. The United States Army covers up the friendly fire incident, awards Serling a medal for bravery, and transfers him to a desk job.

Later, Serling is assigned to determine if, posthumously, Captain Karen Walden should be the first woman to receive the Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey helicopter sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk helicopter. When Walden encountered an enemy T-54 tank, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. Her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and when the survivors were rescued the next day, Walden was reported dead.

Serling notices inconsistencies among the testimonies of Walden&#x27;s crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic, praises Walden strongly. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez claims that Walden was a coward and that he led the crew in combat and improvised the fuel bladder weapon. Sergeant Steven Altameyer, who is dying of cancer in a hospital and was initially hard for Serling to find, complains about a fire in one of his few coherent comments. Warrant Officer Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and was unconscious throughout the ordeal. The crew of the Black Hawk claim that they heard firing from an M16 rifle, but Ilario and Monfriez claim it was out of ammo.

Serling is under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg, to wrap things up quickly. Feeling guilty about the cover up in the friendly fire incident, Serling leaks the existence of a tape of the attack to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner. When Serling grills Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.

Serling tracks Ilario down, and Ilario finally tells him the truth. Monfriez wanted to flee, which would mean abandoning Rady. When Walden refused, he pulled a gun on her and Walden threatened him with a court-martial for mutiny and ordered that he surrender his gun. During the stand-off over Monfriez&#x27;s gun Walden shot an enemy who suddenly appeared behind Monfriez; Monfriez thinking it was Walden firing at him shot her in the stomach, before backing off. The next morning, the enemy attacked again as a rescue party approached. Walden covered her men&#x27;s retreat, firing an M16. Monfriez told the rescuers that Walden was dead, so they left without her. Napalm was then dropped on the entire area. Altameyer tried to expose Monfriez&#x27;s lie at the time, but was too injured to speak, and Ilario remained silent, scared of the court-martial Walden had threatened them with.

Serling presents his final report to Hershberg. Walden&#x27;s young daughter receives the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony. Later, Serling tells the truth to the Boylars about the manner of their son&#x27;s death and says he cannot ask for forgiveness. The Boylars forgive him.

In the last moments, Serling has a flashback of when he was standing by Boylar&#x27;s destroyed tank and a medevac Huey was lifting off with his friend&#x27;s body. Serling suddenly realizes Walden was the pilot. At that moment he is able to let go of the feelings that he has developed for her, and returns to his family.

==Production==
The Pentagon denied a request for access to military equipment for filming. Philip M. Strub, for the Pentagon, said of the film characters that &quot;there wasn&#x27;t a good soldier among them&quot;. Lacking such access, the film-makers had to source equipment elsewhere, including having former Australian Army Centurian tanks modified to resemble the M1 Abrams depicted in the production.

==Reception==

===Box office===
*U.S. domestic gross: US$ 59,031,057 
*International: $41,829,761
*Worldwide gross: $100,860,818

The film opened #3 at the box office behind &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Phenomenon&quot;.

===Critical response===

The film received mostly positive reviews. As of June 15, 2022, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 86% of critics gave the film a positive review based upon a sample of 56 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. The critical consensus states that the film is &quot;an emotional and intriguing tale of a military officer who must review the merits of a fallen officer while confronting his own war demons. Effectively depicts the terrors of war as well as its heartbreaking aftermath.&quot; At the website Metacritic, which uses a weighted average rating system, the film earned a generally favorable rating of 77/100 based on 19 mainstream critic reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The movie was commended by several critics. James Berardinelli of the website ReelViews wrote that the film was, &quot;As profound and intelligent as it is moving, and that makes this memorable motion picture one of 1996&#x27;s best.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; spoke positively of the film saying that while the ending &quot;lays on the emotion a little heavily&quot; the movie had been up until that point &quot;a fascinating emotional and logistical puzzle—almost a courtroom movie, with the desert as the courtroom.&quot;

Denzel Washington&#x27;s acting was specifically lauded, as Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;In Washington&#x27;s haunted eyes, in the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins (&quot;Fargo&quot;) that plunges into the mad flare of combat, in the plot that deftly turns a whodunit into a meditation on character and in Zwick&#x27;s persistent questioning of authority, &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; honors its subject and its audience.&quot; Additionally Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that &quot;Denzel Washington is riveting.&quot;

Matt Damon, on his way to stardom but not there yet, said he lost 40 pounds for his role despite only being scheduled for two days of shooting opposite Washington. When critics and reporters rarely mentioned his appearance in the film, Damon said he contemplated suicide for feeling so overlooked, even though A-List Steven Spielberg would later compliment Damon for his performance and cast him as the titular character in the war epic Saving Private Ryan. After getting medicated, his mental health improved, along with his career recognition and prospects.

===Accolades===
Denzel Washington was nominated for Best Actor at the 1996 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, but lost to Billy Bob Thornton in &quot;Sling Blade&quot;.

==Historical context==
The Medal of Honor was awarded to Mary Edwards Walker, an American Civil War physician, but not for valor in combat. Her name was deleted from the Army Medal of Honor Roll in 1917 (along with over 900 other recipients); however, it was restored in 1977.

<text>Orphan&#x27;s Benefit (sic; original title) is an American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions in black-and-white. It was first released in 1934 and was later remade in Technicolor in 1941 under the corrected title &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot;. It was the 68th Mickey Mouse short film to be released, and the sixth of 1934. The cartoon features Mickey Mouse and his friends putting on a vaudeville-style benefit show for a group of unruly orphans. It contains a number of firsts for Disney, including the first time in which Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck appear together. It was also the cartoon which had the first story to be written that featured Donald Duck, though it was the second Donald Duck short to be produced and released, after &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot;.

&quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot; features original music composed by Frank Churchill. The voice cast includes Walt Disney as Mickey, Clarence Nash as Donald, and Florence Gill as Clara Cluck. The original cartoon was directed by Burt Gillett and distributed by United Artists while the remake was directed by Riley Thomson and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures.

==Plot==

At a local theater, Mickey Mouse holds a benefit performance for the mice orphans. As they file into the building, and they are given free lollipops, ice cream, and balloons.

For the first act, Donald Duck recites &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; and &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot;, but when he says, &quot;come blow your horn&quot;, the orphans disrupt the performance by loudly blowing their noses. A frustrated Donald challenges them to fight but is pulled backstage.

For the second act, Goofy, Horace Horsecollar, and Clarabelle Cow perform an acrobatic dance. Horace dances with Clarabelle and Goofy tries catching her but gets his head stuck. Goofy throws Clarabelle back to Horace. Horace spins Clarabelle around and throws her in Goofy&#x27;s direction. Goofy catches her dress, pulling it off as she flies past, and Clarabelle hits Goofy on the head. Later, Donald once again recites &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; and blows his own horn before the orphans can respond. The orphans blow ice cream at Donald and punch him into a daze with their boxing gloves.

For the third act, Clara Cluck performs &quot;Chi mi frena in tal momento&quot; from Act II of Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, accompanied by Mickey on piano. Eventually, an orphan fires a slingshot from behind her to help finish the song.

Donald begins his final set by reciting &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; yet again, but when he says &quot;Where is that boy who looks after the sheep?&quot; the orphans respond &quot;Under the haystack fast asleep, you dope!&quot; to Donald&#x27;s frustration. The orphans tie bricks, a plant, a fire extinguisher and eggs onto their balloons, float them over his head, and fire their slingshots. After being laughed by the orphans, Donald finally accepts defeat.

==Firsts==

&quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot; was the first appearance of Donald Duck in a &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; series film, marking the characters&#x27; first joint appearance. Donald had previously appeared only in a &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; film.

Although &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot; was Donald&#x27;s second appearance, the film was the first to significantly develop his character. Many of Donald&#x27;s personality traits first seen in &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot; would become permanently associated with him, such as his love of showmanship, his fierce determination, belligerence, and most famously his easily provoked temper. The film also introduced some of Donald&#x27;s physical antics, such as his signature temper tantrum of hopping on one foot while holding out one fist and swinging the other. This was the creation of animator Dick Lundy, who termed this Donald&#x27;s &quot;fighting pose&quot;.

&quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot; also represented a new direction for Disney cartoons, according to Disney historian Marcia Blitz: &quot;It can be seen that the framework of &quot;Orphan&#x27;s Benefit&quot; was traditionally slapstick. Audiences laughed at Donald&#x27;s physical mishaps, much as they laughed at Chaplin&#x27;s or Keaton&#x27;s. But in this instance there was the added dimension of Donald&#x27;s abrasive personality. Surely nothing like it had ever been seen in a cartoon&quot;. Animator Ward Kimball who worked on the film called it a &quot;turning point&quot; for the studio, citing its extensive use of character animation which was used to physically convey personality.

The later Disney film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Amateurs&quot; (1937) was directly inspired by &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot;. Both films feature stage shows with various acts interspersed with Donald attempting to recite a nursery rhyme.

The film was also the debut of Clara Cluck, who would go on to appear in six other cartoon shorts.

==Reception==
The response of audiences to the film, particularly Donald&#x27;s character, led to the duck being featured more in future cartoons. Ward Kimball said &quot;the reaction [to &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot;] that came pouring into the studio from the country was tremendous. The kids in the theater loved or hated or booed Donald Duck&quot;.

==Voice cast==
* Mickey Mouse: Walt Disney
* Donald Duck: Clarence Nash
* Clara Cluck: Florence Gill
* Goofy: Pinto Colvig

==Remake==
In the summer of 1939, in anticipation of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s 12th anniversary the following year, Walt Disney commissioned a two-reel short film tentatively called &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Revival Party&quot;. The plan was for this film to show the characters attending a theater where they would watch scenes from several old, mostly black and white &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; films (among them &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot;). The story artists envisioned the characters humorously interacting with themselves on the movie screen. This required the old animation footage to be redrawn completely rather than added in its original state.

It was during this process that Walt Disney decided to completely reproduce several of these old shorts in color. It was also an opportunity to update the character models in Technicolor, since many characters had changed in appearance since the early 1930s, such as Mickey and the orphans&#x27; eyes gaining scleras and Donald&#x27;s duckbill changing shape.

&quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot; was the first of these films to be remade. The result was an almost exact shot-for-shot version of the original, with added color and redrawn characters and backgrounds. The film was directed by Riley Thomson and used almost the entire original soundtrack, the only change being the final line, from &quot;Aw nuts!&quot; to &quot;Aw phooey!&quot; which had become a catchphrase for Donald by that time. &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot; was released to theaters on August 12, 1941, by RKO Radio Pictures.

The next film scheduled for reproduction was &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Man Friday&quot; (1935), but it was never completed. The original concept for &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Revival Party&quot; was shelved, and &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot; became the only Disney film to be recreated scene for scene. It is unknown what led to the cancellation, although animation historian David Gerstein speculated that Disney&#x27;s World War II propaganda (such as &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot;, &quot;Education for Death&quot;, and &quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot;) or the Disney animators&#x27; strike of 1941 may have played a role, or that Walt Disney simply preferred to work on all-new films rather than &quot;extensively revisit the past&quot;.

==Historical notes==
Donald&#x27;s recitation of &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; was inspired by Clarence Nash&#x27;s own recitation of the poem on the radio, a performance he had intended to sound like a nervous baby goat. It was largely because of this performance that Nash was hired by Disney to voice the duck.

Donald impersonates the comedian Jimmy Durante when he says, &quot;Am I mortified! Am I mortified!&quot; His bill even changes shape to make fun of Durante&#x27;s famous nose. The joke was not as noticeable in the remake because Donald&#x27;s bill keeps its shape.

In 1989, an animation cel from the original &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot;, depicting Donald being punched by an orphan, sold for $286,000 (then £174,390) at a Christie&#x27;s auction in New York. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; confirmed this was the most money ever paid for a black and white animation cel.

==Adaptations==
In 1968, Disneyland Records released an abridged audio-only version of &quot;Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot; on the album &quot;Mickey Mouse and his Friends&quot; as the track &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Big Show&quot;. The album was re-released in 2010 as a digital download on Amazon MP3 and the iTunes Store.

In October 1973, the story was adapted into a 13-page comic book story in the Italian publication &quot;Cartonatoni Disney&quot; #14. The story was called &quot;Recita di Beneficenza&quot;, or &quot;Benefit Recital&quot;. The same year an English version was published in the American comic book &quot;Walt Disney Magic Moments&quot; #1, called &quot;The Orphans&#x27; Benefit&quot;.

<text>Robin Wayne Zander (born January 23, 1953) is an American musician, best known as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist for the rock band Cheap Trick, but is also a solo artist. Zander was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016 as a member of Cheap Trick.
==Early life==
Zander was born in Beloit, Wisconsin, and grew up in nearby Loves Park, Illinois. He learned to play the guitar by age 12. Zander graduated from Harlem High School in Machesney Park, Illinois. After playing in high school bands in the 1960s, he joined Brian Beebe to form the folk duo Zander &amp; Kent in the early 1970s.

==Music career==
===Cheap Trick===

In 1974, Zander accepted an invitation to join Cheap Trick. Along with Zander, the band consisted of guitarist Rick Nielsen, bassist Tom Petersson, and drummer Bun E. Carlos. Cheap Trick&#x27;s 1979 album, &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot;, catapulted the band to stardom. The band reached the Top 10 in the U.S. charts in 1979 with &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot; and topped the charts in 1988 with &quot;The Flame&quot;. As of 2018, Cheap Trick had been a band for over 40 years. Cheap Trick has performed more than 5,000 shows and has sold more than 20 million albums. Zander was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Cheap Trick in 2016.

===Other work===
Zander released the solo album &quot;Robin Zander&quot; in 1993. A second solo album, &quot;Countryside Blvd&quot;, was released online in April 2011 but was withdrawn from online music outlets within hours of being available.

On September 30, 2016, Los Angeles rock band Steel Panther released a cover version of Cheap Trick song &quot;She&#x27;s Tight&quot; (from Cheap Trick&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;One On One&quot;), which features Zander in the music video.

===Influence===
Known for his &quot;pin-up good looks&quot;, Zander&#x27;s singing has been described as &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; and &quot;supremely virtuosic&quot;. In a 2014 piece titled &quot;Unsung Heroes: The 10 Most Underrated Classic Rock Singers&quot;, Dan Tucker of VH1.com described Zander as having &quot;range, style and attitude.&quot; Zander is a tenor.

Zander&#x27;s vocal style has influenced many other rock singers, from 1980s hard rockers (such as Joe Elliott of Def Leppard, Vince Neil of Mötley Crüe, Axl Rose of Guns N&#x27; Roses, Bret Michaels of Poison, and Sebastian Bach of Skid Row) to 1990s punk revivalists (such as Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day) to alternative singers (such as Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins, Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, and Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots).

The May 2009 issue of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine published a list of the 50 Greatest Singers in Rock. Zander was voted #23 on the list by readers, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; critics and a number of singers.

==Personal life==

Zander and his first wife, Karen, had a son Ian and a daughter Holland.

As of 2018, Zander lives in Safety Harbor, Florida with his wife, former Playboy Playmate Pamela Stein. Zander and Stein have a son Robin and a daughter; both are singer-songwriters. When Cheap Trick bassist Tom Petersson was unable to tour in 2021 due to surgery, Zander&#x27;s son filled in for him on tour.

<text>Brad M. Carlson (born June 12, 1950), better known by the stage name Bun E. Carlos, is the original drummer for American rock band Cheap Trick. He recorded and performed with the band from 1973 to 2010. Carlos was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016 as a member of Cheap Trick.

==Early life==
Carlson was born in Rockford, Illinois, on June 12. The year of his birth is reportedly 1950, 1951, or 1953. His parents were Edwin and Violet ( Nelles) Carlson. Carlson was the third of six children. He has two older siblings (Kurt and Jan) and three younger ones (Mark, Gini, and Edwin). Carlson&#x27;s elder brother, Kurt, was a major in the United States Army Reserve when, on June 14, 1985, TWA Flight 847 was hijacked by terrorists belonging to Hezbollah. He was brutally beaten (nearly to death) and was held for 17 days aboard the aircraft in Beirut, Lebanon.

Carlson attended Lincoln Junior High School and graduated from Guilford High School, where fellow students included Nielsen and Tom Petersson. Carlson&#x27;s friendship with Rick Nielsen began in 1963. Carlson and Nielsen met after Carlson&#x27;s sister, Jan, came home from school one day and said Nielsen was throwing rocks at her. Carlson played football in the fall of 1966 in his sophomore year. He quit the team because he preferred to play music (and be paid for it) than sit on the bench for an entire game.

Carlson came from a family with extensive musical interests. Carlson family oral history says that Carlson&#x27;s great-grandfather was a drummer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Carlson&#x27;s father played the accordion, his mother played keyboards and several other instruments, and his brother Kurt was a drummer in the Guilford High School band,

Carlson did not start paying attention to music until about 1962 or 1963, when songs like &quot;The Twist,&quot; &quot;Return to Sender&quot; and &quot;Sugar Shack&quot; became chart toppers. He initially taught himself to play piano, but when The Beatles&#x27; single, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, received radio airplay in the United States, Carlson became a fan and decided to switch to drums. His mother gave him a Sonor drum kit for his 14th birthday. He began taking formal lessons, but was frustrated by having to constantly change the sticking instructions because he was left-handed. Carlson gave up formal lessons and instead taught himself to play the drums by playing along with songs on the radio or jukebox. He was particularly impressed by the drumming of Ginger Baker, co-founder of the British rock band Cream.

==Early musical career==
From 1966 to 1968, Carlson played in a band called The Pagans with several other high school friends. The band released a single: the A-side was a cover of The Beatles&#x27; 1966 hit &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;, and B-side a cover of Them &quot;I Can Only Give You Everything.&quot; The single received local radio airplay on WCFL in Chicago and WROK in Rockford and the band sold about 1,500 copies at local record stores, making The Pagans hometown celebrities. The Pagans broke up, and Carlson played in another local band, Probe and the Lost Souls (which later changed its name to Albatross), in 1969.

Carlson enrolled at Rock Valley Junior College in 1969 to obtain an exemption to the draft. He and Robin Zander, the future lead singer of Cheap Trick, were members of the same band for a brief period at this time. Carlson also briefly toured in backup bands for Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and The Shirelles.

Meanwhile, Rick Nielsen and Tom Petersson formed a band in 1969 and called it Fuse. Carlson dropped out of college and in 1971 moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with Nielsen and Petersson. Fuse changed its name to Sick Man of Europe. In 1970, Carlson became the band&#x27;s drummer, and had changed his stage name to Bun E. Carlos. Carlson toured Germany with the band, with Nielsen taking on the bassist&#x27;s duties.

==Cheap Trick==
===Formation===
In about May 1973, the members of Sick Man of Europe relocated to Rockford and the band broke up. In June 1973, Carlos and Nielsen formed a new band to take over the gigs which Sick Man of Europe had booked. Randy &quot;Xeno&quot; Hogan was hired as lead vocalist and Rick Szeluga as bassist. The band continued to use the name Sick Man of Europe, but nightclub owners did not like the name. For about a month, the band used the name The Reapers. In early August 1973, the group adopted the name Cheap Trick. Tom Petersson, then living in Europe, returned to the United States and joined Cheap Trick in November 1973.

Cheap Trick was being booked regularly at clubs in the Midwest for $100 a night ($ in dollars) and was getting some repeat bookings. In late 1973 or early 1974, Carlos cut his hair short and began sporting a &quot;bandit&quot; mustache. He visited a thrift store and purchased several comfortable suits and about 20 white cotton dress shirts. The new wardrobe was inexpensive, looked good, and was comfortable.

Interpersonal problems began to affect the band, as Hogan and Petersson did not get along. In the summer of 1974, Hogan left Cheap Trick to join The Litter, a Minneapolis-based band. A few days later, Carlos and Nielsen asked Zander to sing for Cheap Trick. Zander was able to get out of the last year of his contract and joined Cheap Trick in October 1974.

In 1973 or 1974, Carlos gained a major insight into his drumming. He told interviewer Robin Tolleson in 1986 that, like most young drummers, he was mostly interested in making his drumming stand out (&quot;Where can I get the most licks in, and how cool can I sound&quot;). While listening to a tape of a Cheap Trick concert, he realized he was rushing the beat and interfering in the performance of the other band members. Afterward, he began taping every Cheap Trick show to study his own drumming much more objectively, focusing on keeping time and supporting his bandmates. The band also played several gigs alongside Mahavishnu Orchestra about this time. Carlos says he learned a great deal about ambidextrous drumming from drummer Billy Cobham.

===Mainstream success===
In 1976, Carlos tripped over equipment on stage and broke his arm. The band auditioned several drummers to temporarily replace Carlos until his arm healed. None proved capable of keeping up with Cheap Trick&#x27;s frenetic, high-energy style. The band finally turned to Hank Ransome, drummer with the defunct psychedelic rock/progressive rock band Elizabeth. Carlos played alongside Ransome for several shows in case Ransome tired during a performance. Cheap Trick signed a five-year contract with Epic on August 1, 1976. Cheap Trick played a last concert at the Second Chance club in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in October 1976, then headed for New York City to record an album.

The band began work on its debut album at the Record Plant recording studio in New York City in November 1976. The record, titled &quot;Cheap Trick&quot; (1977), failed to chart. The album&#x27;s liner notes and Epic&#x27;s promotional advertising made the tongue-in-cheek claims that &quot;Bunezuela E. Carlos&quot; was from Venezuela, his parents helped build the Panama Canal, and that he abandoned his family to come play rock music in America.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;In Color&quot;, was released later in 1977. When Cheap Trick toured in Japan for the first time in April 1978, they were received with a frenzy reminiscent of Beatlemania. During the tour, Cheap Trick recorded two concerts at the Nippon Budokan. However, due to the loud crowd applause, the recordings were deemed inferior, and replaced with recordings from Cheap Trick’s Osaka, Japan concert. Ten tracks taken from the Osaka concert were compiled and released as a live album titled &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot;, which was intended to be exclusive to Japan.

Demand for &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; became so great that Epic Records finally released the album in the U.S. in February 1979. &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; launched the band into international stardom, and the album went triple platinum in the United States. The first single from the album was the live version of &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;, which had originally been released on &quot;In Color&quot;. It reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and became Cheap Trick&#x27;s best-selling single to date.

Following a decline in popularity in the early-to-mid-1980s, Cheap Trick released &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot; in 1988. &quot;The Flame&quot;, a ballad, was issued as the first single from the album and became the band&#x27;s first-ever No. 1 hit. The second single, a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, peaked at no. 4. &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot; went platinum and became recognized as the band&#x27;s comeback album.

&quot;Busted&quot; was released in 1990. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Falling Into Love&quot;, reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Carlos suffered from back problems for several years. He had surgery in 2004, which he said fixed the problem.

In 2007, officials of Rockford, Illinois, honored Cheap Trick by reproducing the &quot;Rockford&quot; album cover art on that year&#x27;s city vehicle sticker. On June 19, 2007, the Illinois Senate passed Senate Resolution 255, which designated April 1 of every year as Cheap Trick Day in the State of Illinois.

===2013 lawsuit===
According to Carlos, he and Zander had a falling-out shortly before the band made its appearance on the television program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;. The dispute centered on the number of appearances the band would make at the Paris Las Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. On March 19, 2010, Cheap Trick issued a statement that Carlos had stopped recording and touring with Cheap Trick and that he left the band. He was replaced by Rick Nielsen&#x27;s son, Daxx, who was named the band&#x27;s touring drummer.

In 2012, the band stopped contacting Carlos about business decisions and stopped making payments. He filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking at least $600,000 ($ in dollars) in back income and damages as well as restoration of his decision-making input and voting rights.

In April 2014, Nielsen, Petersson, and Zander filed a motion to dismiss Carlos&#x27;s case; the motion was denied. On February 26, 2015, Zander announced that the lawsuit had been settled. &quot;Bun E.&#x27;s a member of the band but he&#x27;s not touring. We&#x27;ve had our differences but we&#x27;re all settled up now and hopefully we can forget about that era. These decisions that Cheap Trick makes, Bun E. is part of.&quot; Carlos told Andy Greene of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the settlement resolved issues with monetary payments, business participation, and voting rights. The lawsuit ended his personal relationship with Nielsen, Petersson, and Zander, however. He told Green, &quot;[A]ny friendship we had went away when I had to file a federal lawsuit. ... Going after these guys wasn&#x27;t pleasant. The friendship sort of frittered away there.&quot;
===Post-lawsuit years===
Since the band&#x27;s beginning, Carlos maintained the set lists for every Cheap Trick concert. He also made or assisted in making recordings of all the band&#x27;s concerts, and remained the band&#x27;s archivist and setlister after the lawsuit. Between 2000 and 2002, Carlos released four volumes of &quot;Bun E.&#x27;s Basement Bootlegs&quot;. These live recordings of concerts, sound checks, covers, and acoustic and semi-acoustic versions of Cheap Trick songs were released via the band&#x27;s web site. There were just 1,000 pressings of each release, issued in &quot;bootleg&quot; packing (e.g., simple white cardboard sleeve, little information about each song).

Carlos appeared with Cheap Trick on April 4, 2016, when the band was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Nielsen was reportedly excited to play alongside his original bandmate, saying, &quot;they are inducting the people who made the records way back when and that&#x27;s good. He deserves it.&quot; The Hall of Fame live setlist included: &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;, &quot;Dream Police&quot;, and &quot;Surrender&quot;. In his induction speech, Carlos thanked his family, his bandmates, CBS Records, his drum techs, his managers, and producers Tom Werman and Sir George Martin.

==Tinted Windows, Candy Golde, and solo work==
Carlos is a long-time member of the group First Airborne Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Division. The group includes members of The Doobie Brothers, Kansas, Little River Band, Pablo Cruise, and Toto. First Airborne performs at USO-sponsored concerts at U.S. armed forces bases overseas.

In 2009, Carlos, together with Hanson singer Taylor Hanson, Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, and Fountains of Wayne bassist Adam Schlesinger, formed a new band, Tinted Windows. This new project ran alongside each of the artists&#x27; main bands. Tinted Windows played its first publicized gig at SXSW in Austin, Texas, on March 20, 2009, and appeared on late-night network TV shows. Their album was released on April 21, 2009.

On June 24, 2016, Carlos issued his first-ever solo album, &quot;Greetings from Bunezuela!&quot; featuring performances by Hanson, Alex Dezen and Dave Pirner.

<doc id="235304" wikidata="Q7244468" url="?curid=235304" title="Walk-in (concept)">
<text>A walk-in is a New Age concept of a person whose original soul has departed their body and has been replaced with a new, different, soul. Ruth Montgomery popularized the concept in her 1979 book &quot;Strangers Among Us&quot;.

==Beliefs==
Believers maintain that it is possible for the original soul of a human to leave a person&#x27;s body and for another soul to &quot;walk in&quot;. In Montgomery&#x27;s work, souls are said to &quot;walk in&quot; during a period of intense personal problems on the part of the departing soul, or during or because of an accident or trauma. Some other walk-ins describe their entry as occurring based on prior agreement and when the previous soul was &quot;complete&quot;. The walk-in being/individual retains the memories of the original personality, but does not have emotions associated with the memories. As they integrate, they bring their own mental, emotional, spiritual consciousness and evolve the life to resonate with their purpose and intentions. Incarnating into a fully grown body allows the walk-in soul to engage in embodiment without having to go through the two decades of maturation that humans need to reach adulthood. A walk-in soul also does not experience the conditioning of childhood and has a different relationship to life because they were not born.

==In popular culture==
The 1941 film &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; and the 1978 remake &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; portrays one soul replacing a recently deceased man&#x27;s soul and reviving to inhabit his body. 

The &quot;Hawkgirl&quot; comics, the &quot;K-PAX&quot; series of books and film, and the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank&quot; have all featured situations similar or identical to walk-in experiences, although the term &quot;walk-in&quot; is not used.

In the &quot;Death of Superman&quot; story cycle, a handful of new superheroes appeared, among them John Henry Irons, who called himself the &quot;Man of Steel&quot;. Irons never claimed to be the real Superman, but Lois Lane speculated that if Superman were really dead, his soul might have moved into Irons&#x27; body, mentioning walk-ins explicitly.

&quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Red Museum&quot; discusses walk-ins, described by Mulder as enlightened spirits who have taken possession of the bodies of people who have lost hope and who want to leave their life. The concept is returned to in the episodes &quot;Sein Und Zeit&quot; and &quot;Closure&quot;. 

In the TV series &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, the season 4 episode &quot;Threshold&quot; used the term &quot;step-in&quot; when the soul of one of the series&#x27; main characters, who had died in the previous episode, enters the body of a man who dies in an unrelated accident.

Stephen King speaks of &quot;walk-ins&quot; several times in books 6 and 7 of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; novels, but King&#x27;s walk-ins are usually physical travellers, or - when they possess another&#x27;s body - are more guests, sharing the body with the original mind as strangers. John Callum mentions them in &quot;The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah&quot;. The term is also used in the CODA section of this book. In &quot;The Talisman&quot;, cowritten by King, the concept of &quot;Twinners&quot; is presented in a similar manner: Twinners are separate but fundamentally similar individuals that live parallel existences on Earth and in the world of the Territories. If either or both of the pair gain awareness of their Twinner, they can learn to occupy the other&#x27;s body in their respective worlds in style of a walk-in.

The main character Myne in &quot;Ascendance of a Bookworm&quot; is a walk-in. Originally a light novel, the story was released in anime format October 2019.

Gabriel James Byrne was born on 12 May 1950 in Walkinstown, Dublin, Ireland, the son of Roman Catholic parents. His father Dan was a soldier and cooper, while his mother Eileen (née Gannon), from Elphin, County Roscommon, was a hospital nurse. He has five younger siblings: Donal, Thomas, Breda, Margaret, and a sister who died at an early age, Marian.

Byrne attended Ardscoil Éanna secondary school in Crumlin, where he later taught Spanish and history. He attended University College Dublin, where he studied archaeology, Spanish and linguistics, and graduated with a BA in 1972, becoming proficient in the Irish language. He went on to complete a Higher Diploma in Education (HDipEd) in 1973.

About his early training to become a priest, Byrne said in an interview, &quot;I spent five years in the seminary and I suppose it was assumed that one had a vocation. I realised subsequently that I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Byrne played football in Dublin with Stella Maris.

In January 2011, Byrne spoke in an interview on &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; about being sexually abused by priests during his childhood.

==Career==
Byrne worked in archaeology when he left UCD. He maintained his love of his language, later writing the first television drama in Irish, &quot;Draíocht&quot;, on Ireland&#x27;s national Irish-language television station, TG4, when it began broadcasting in 1996.

Before becoming an actor, Byrne had many jobs, including archaeologist, cook, and Spanish and history school teacher at Ardscoil Éanna in Crumlin. He started acting at age 29, and began his career on stage with the Focus Theatre and the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. He later joined the Performing Arts Course at Roslyn Park College in Sandymount. He came to prominence on the final season of the Irish television show &quot;The Riordans&quot;, subsequently starring in his own spin-off series, &quot;Bracken&quot;. His first play for television was Michael Feeney Callan&#x27;s &quot;Love Is ...&quot; (RTÉ). He made his film debut in 1981, as King Uther Pendragon in John Boorman&#x27;s King Arthur epic, &quot;Excalibur&quot;.

In 1983, Byrne appeared with Richard Burton in the miniseries &quot;Wagner&quot;, co-starring Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson. In 1985, he starred in the acclaimed political thriller &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot;, though he subsequently said he had been upstaged by his co-star, veteran actor Denholm Elliott: &quot;I amended the actor&#x27;s cliché to &#x27;Never work with children, animals or Denholm Elliott&#x27;.&quot; In the 90s, his production company Plurabelle Films received a first look deal with Phoenix Pictures.

In 2007, Byrne led the jury of the Kerry Film Festival.

Upon his return to theatre in 2008, Byrne appeared as King Arthur in &quot;Camelot&quot; with the New York Philharmonic from 7 to 10 May, following the footsteps of veteran actors Richard Burton and Richard Harris. Byrne was cast in a film adaptation of Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s metafictional novel &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;, alongside Colin Farrell and Cillian Murphy. Actor Brendan Gleeson was set to direct the film. In October 2009, however, Gleeson expressed fear that, should the Irish Film Board be abolished as planned by the Irish State, the production might fall through.

Byrne starred as therapist Paul Weston in the HBO series &quot;In Treatment&quot; from 2008 to 2010. He was named as TV&#x27;s &quot;latest Dr. McDreamy&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot; for this role, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series in 2008. 

In 2011, Byrne signed up to appear in a film by director Costa-Gavras, &quot;Le Capital&quot;, an adaptation of Stéphane Osmont&#x27;s novel of the same name.

In 2017, Byrne appeared in &quot;Mad to Be Normal&quot; (previously titled &quot;Metanoia&quot;), a biopic of the Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing, produced by Gizmo Films.

&quot;Walking with Ghosts&quot;, Byrne&#x27;s one-man show based on his memoir of the same title (published by Grove Press in January 2021), premiered at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin on 1 February 2022, before playing at the Edinburgh International Festival. It opened on 6 September 2022 at the Apollo Theatre in London, marking Byrne&#x27;s West End debut at the age of 72, in &#x27;a career-best performance&#x27;, and opened on 26 October 2022 at the Music Box Theatre on Broadway.

==Personal life==
Byrne had a 12-year relationship with television producer and presenter Aine O&#x27;Connor, from 1974 to 1986. He began a relationship with actress Ellen Barkin, and relocated to Manhattan to be with her. A year later, in 1988, he married Barkin, with whom he has two children. The couple separated amicably in 1993, and divorced in 1999. He later married Hannah Beth King on 4 August 2014 at Ballymaloe House in County Cork. , Byrne lives with his family in Rockport, Maine.

At the fifth Jameson Dublin International Film Festival in 2007, Byrne was presented with the first of the new Volta awards, for lifetime achievement in acting. He received the Honorary Patronage of the University Philosophical Society, of Trinity College Dublin on 20 February 2007. In November 2007, he was awarded an honorary degree by the National University of Ireland, Galway; the president of the university, Iognáid Ó Muircheartaigh, said that the award was in recognition of the actor&#x27;s &quot;outstanding contribution to Irish and international film&quot;.

Byrne released a documentary for the 20th Galway Film Fleadh in the summer of 2008 called &quot;Stories from Home&quot;, an intimate portrait about his life. It premiered in the United States in September 2009 at the Los Angeles Irish Film Festival.

Byrne mentioned in interviews and his 1994 autobiography, &quot;Pictures in My Head&quot; that he hates being called &quot;brooding&quot;. He has been listed by &quot;People&quot; as one of the &quot;Sexiest Men Alive&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; has also dubbed Byrne as one of the hottest celebrities over the age of 50.

Byrne is an atheist and has been vocally critical of the Catholic Church, which he described in a 2011 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;repressive of women and minorities and repressive of its followers&quot;. In the same interview, he said that he still reads the Bible &quot;for the fables&quot;.

Byrne was cultural ambassador for Ireland until he criticised The Gathering, a tourism initiative to encourage people of Irish heritage to visit the country, describing it as &quot;a scam&quot; and adding that the majority of Irish people &quot;don&#x27;t give a shit about the diaspora except to shake them down for a few quid&quot;. Byrne also criticised the marketing strategy employed by Guinness known as Arthur&#x27;s Day as &quot;a cynical piece of exercise in a country which has a huge drinking problem&quot;.

<text>Claude Joséphine Rose Cardinale (; born 15 April 1938), known as Claudia Cardinale (), is an Italian actress.

Born and raised in La Goulette, a neighbourhood of Tunis, Cardinale won the &quot;Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia&quot; competition in 1957, the prize being a trip to Italy, which quickly led to film contracts, due above all to the involvement of Franco Cristaldi, who acted as her mentor for a number of years and later married her. After making her debut in a minor role with Egyptian star Omar Sharif in &quot;Goha&quot; (1958), Cardinale became one of the best-known actresses in Italy, with roles in films such as &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; (1960), &quot;Girl with a Suitcase&quot; (1961), &quot;Cartouche&quot; (1962), &quot;The Leopard&quot; (1963), and Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963).

From 1963, Cardinale appeared in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; opposite David Niven. She went on to appear in the Hollywood films &quot;Blindfold&quot; (1965), &quot;Lost Command&quot; (1966), &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1966), &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot; (1967) with Tony Curtis, &quot;The Hell with Heroes&quot; (1968), and the Sergio Leone Western &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968), a joint US-Italian production, in which she was praised for her role as a former prostitute opposite Jason Robards, Charles Bronson, and Henry Fonda.

Jaded with the Hollywood film industry and not wanting to become a cliché, Cardinale returned to Italian and French cinema, and garnered the David di Donatello for Best Actress award for her roles in &quot;Il giorno della civetta&quot; (1968) and as a prostitute alongside Alberto Sordi in &quot;A Girl in Australia&quot; (1971). In 1974, Cardinale met director Pasquale Squitieri, who would become her partner, and she frequently featured in his films, including &quot;I guappi&quot; (1974), &quot;Corleone&quot; (1978), and &quot;Claretta&quot; (1984), the last of which won her the Nastro d&#x27;Argento Award for Best Actress. In 1982, she starred in Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; as the love interest of Klaus Kinski, who raises the funds to buy a steamship in Peru. In 2010, Cardinale received the Best Actress Award at the 47th Antalya &quot;Golden Orange&quot; International Film Festival for her performance as an elderly Italian woman who takes in a young Turkish exchange student in &quot;Signora Enrica&quot;.

Outspoken on women&#x27;s rights causes over the years, Cardinale has been a UNESCO goodwill ambassador for the Defence of Women&#x27;s Rights since March 2000. In February 2011, the &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot; named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history.

==Early life==
Claudia Cardinale was born Claude Joséphine Rose Cardinale in La Goulette, a neighbourhood of Tunis, Tunisia, on 15 April 1938. Her father, Francesco Cardinale, was a railway worker, born in Gela, Sicily. Her mother Yolande Greco was born in the then Italian Tripolitania to Sicilian parents emigrants from Trapani where they owned a small shipbuilding firm. They later settled in La Goulette, which had a large Italian community. Her native languages were French, Tunisian Arabic, and the Sicilian language of her parents. She did not learn to speak Italian fluently until she started being cast in Italian films.

Cardinale was educated at the Saint-Joseph-de-l&#x27;Apparition School of Carthage, which she attended along with her younger sister Blanche. She then studied at the Paul Cambon School, graduating with the intention of becoming a teacher. As a teenager, she was described as &quot;silent, weird, and wild&quot;, and like other young women of her generation, was fascinated by Brigitte Bardot, who came to prominence in the 1956 film &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;, directed by Roger Vadim.

==Career==
===1950s===
Cardinale&#x27;s first film work was participating, along with classmates, in a short film by French director René Vautier, &quot;Anneaux d&#x27;or&quot;, successfully presented at the Berlin Film Festival. The film made her a minor local celebrity, and led to her being spotted by Jacques Baratier, who offered her a minor role in &quot;Goha&quot;. She accepted it reluctantly after Baratier explained he wanted a Tunisian actress rather than an Italian to star in the main role opposite Egyptian actor Omar Sharif. The appearance nonetheless marked her feature-film debut. The turning point came in 1957 during the Italian Cinema Week in Tunis, when she won a competition for the &quot;Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia&quot;, with a trip to the Venice Film Festival as first prize. After being spotted by several film producers at the event, she was invited to study at the Experimental Cinematography Centre in Rome under Tina Lattanzi. She attended briefly as, despite her extremely photogenic looks, she had trouble with her acting assignments (partly owing to her difficulties with the Italian language). She left at the end of her first term and decided to return home, earning herself a cover story in the popular weekly &quot;Epoca&quot; triggered by her unexpected decision to turn her back on a career as a film star.

Back in Tunis, however, Cardinale discovered unexpectedly that she was pregnant, the result of what she later described as a &quot;terrible&quot; relationship with a Frenchman, some 10 years her senior, which began when she was only 17 and lasted for about a year. On this discovery, he wanted her to have an abortion, but she decided to keep the child. She solved her problems by signing a seven-year exclusive contract with Franco Cristaldi&#x27;s production company Vides. Cristaldi largely managed her early career, and she was married to him from 1966 until 1975.

Under the new contract, in 1958, Cardinale was given a minor role with Italian actors Vittorio Gassman, Totò, Marcello Mastroianni, and Renato Salvatori in Mario Monicelli&#x27;s internationally successful criminal comedy &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; (). She portrayed Carmelita, a Sicilian girl virtually imprisoned in her home by her overpowering brother. The comedy was a huge success, making Cardinale instantly recognisable. Some newspapers were already referring to her as &quot;la fidanzata d&#x27;Italia&quot; (Italy&#x27;s sweetheart). Later that year, she had a leading role opposite Yvonne Monlaur in Claudio Gora&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Three Strangers in Rome&quot;.

Although she worked well into her seventh month, Cardinale&#x27;s pregnancy was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, she fell into a state of depression. When she thought she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition, as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: &quot;I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, as if it had been publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides&quot;. For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in &quot;Oggi&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Europeo&quot;.

In 1959, she appeared opposite Salvatori in the mafia film &quot;Vento del sud&quot;, and played the wife of Maurizio Arena in Luigi Zampa&#x27;s &quot;Il magistrato&quot;. Cardinale also starred opposite Pietro Germi in his crime film &quot;The Facts of Murder&quot;, an important assignment for her in mastering the craft of acting while learning to feel at ease in front of the camera. Cardinale considered it to have been her first real test as an actress. She then played the role of Maria in Ralph Thomas&#x27;s British film &quot;Upstairs and Downstairs&quot;, which starred Michael Craig and Anne Heywood. In her early roles, she was usually dubbed, as producers considered her voice too hoarse.

===1960s===

In 1960, Cardinale starred opposite Marcello Mastroianni in Mauro Bolognini&#x27;s Golden Leopard-winning drama film . The film marked the start of a fruitful partnership. Cardinale stated that her films with Bolognini were among the most joyful of her career, considering him to be &quot;a great director, a man of rare professional capability, great taste, and culture. Beyond that, for me personally, a sensitive and sincere friend.&quot; In Bolognini&#x27;s films, thanks to her aesthetic femininity, Cardinale took roles of manipulative women who lead men to perdition. During the filming of , her co-star Marcello Mastroianni fell in love with her, but she rejected him, as she did not take his love seriously, considering him to be one of those actors who cannot help but fall in love with their co-stars. Mastroianni insisted that his feelings were genuine, even after many years. The genuine empathy between the two actors proved to be ideal for reproducing the tension between the characters in the film. Cardinale next portrayed Pauline Bonaparte in Abel Gance&#x27;s French film &quot;Napoleone ad Austerlitz&quot;, and after appearing opposite Gassman and Salvatori in the sequel to &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot;, &quot;Audace colpo dei soliti ignoti&quot;, she portrayed Ginetta, the fiancée of Spiros Focás, alongside Salvatori and Alain Delon in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot;. However, her leading performance in Francesco Maselli&#x27;s &quot;Silver Spoon Set&quot; gained her most attention during this period. Francesco Freda felt the film paved her way &quot;to great success&quot;, noting the &quot;sweetness of her smile&quot; which struck a chord with the public.
In 1961, Cardinale portrayed a sultry nightclub singer and young mother in Valerio Zurlini&#x27;s &quot;Girl with a Suitcase&quot;. As a result of her own experience of early motherhood, Cardinale naturally conveyed the concerns of a teenaged mother, identifying fully with the character of Aida. Such was her psychological involvement that she needed several months to overcome her apprehensions and prepare for the part. Zurlini chose her for such a difficult role against everyone&#x27;s advice, as she was not yet considered a &quot;real&quot; actress, nor was she (yet) one of the most celebrated Italian beauties. He was very close and supportive of Cardinale during the production, though, and a true friendship developed between the two, based on a deep mutual understanding. Cardinale remarked: &quot;Zurlini was one of those who really love women: he had an almost feminine sensitivity. He could understand me at a glance. He taught me everything, without ever making demands on me. ... He was really very fond of me.&quot; Cardinale was warmly praised by the critics for her performance in &quot;Girl with a Suitcase&quot;, Dennis Schwartz considering her to have been at her &quot;charming best&quot;. Later in 1961, Cardinale starred as a prostitute opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in Bolognini&#x27;s &quot;La Viaccia&quot;. Both &quot;Girl with a Suitcase&quot; and &quot;La Viaccia&quot; were presented at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. At the time, Cardinale was not considered comparable to the two divas of Italian cinema, Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, but several newspapers and magazines, including &quot;Paris Match&quot;, began to consider her to be a credible young rival to Brigitte Bardot. Cardinale&#x27;s 1961 appearances also included Henri Verneuil&#x27;s French comedy &quot;Les Lions sont lâchés&quot; and &quot;Auguste&quot;, in which she had a cameo role.

The following year, Cardinale starred opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo as Vénus in the 18th-century set adventure &quot;Cartouche&quot;, which made her a major star in France. She also played Angiolina, the romantic interest of Anthony Franciosa in Bolognini&#x27;s &quot;Senilità&quot;, a character which film writer Jacek Klinowski describes as &quot;a spirited and strikingly beautiful 20-year-old&quot;. In 1962, Cardinale was interviewed by the writer Alberto Moravia, who focused exclusively on her sexuality and body image in films, treating her as an object. Cardinale remarked to him: &quot;I used my body as a mask, as a representation of myself&quot;. The interview was published in &quot;Esquire&quot; under the title &quot;The Next Goddess of Love&quot;. Cardinale was amused to discover that the interview had inspired the writer to publish &quot;La dea dell&#x27;amore&quot; (&quot;Goddess of Love&quot;) the following year, in which one of the characters, with her fine physical appearance and natural curves, closely resembled Cardinale. Just a few years later, she played a similar character in a film based on another novel by Moravia, &quot;Time of Indifference&quot;.
The finest and most prolific year of her career was 1963, when she appeared in a number of leading productions. She starred alongside Burt Lancaster in Visconti&#x27;s &quot;The Leopard&quot; (1963) (&quot;Il Gattopardo&quot;), portraying a village girl who married a progressive young aristocrat (Alain Delon), and played a film actress cast by a director (Marcello Mastroianni) in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot;. Both films were critically acclaimed and are often cited by critics and scholars as among the greatest films ever made. She participated in the two films during exactly the same period, frequently moving from one to the other and experiencing the strictly planned approach of Visconti, which contrasted strongly with Fellini&#x27;s much more relaxed style and his almost total reliance on improvisation. Cardinale remembered Visconti&#x27;s set as having an almost religious atmosphere, everything focused on the film, far removed from the outside world. Visconti needed silence for his work, while Fellini preferred noise and confusion.

Prior to this period, Cardinale&#x27;s own voice had not been used in her Italian films, as it was considered too hoarse, and owing to her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until &quot;8½&quot; was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: &quot;When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn&#x27;t speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn&#x27;t understand what they were talking about. And I was speaking in French; in fact, I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice.&quot; With her portrayal of Angelica in &quot;The Leopard&quot; and her brief appearance as herself in &quot;8½&quot;, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.

The same year, Cardinale starred as Mara in &quot;La ragazza di Bube&quot; or &quot;Bebo&#x27;s Girl&quot;, in which she also used her own voice. For her performance in the film, she received her first Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Actress in 1965. Cardinale acted in her first American film (although it was produced in Italy) when she played Princess Dala, a wealthy aristocratic woman who is the love and jewellery interest of David Niven in the Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo-set &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;. Cardinale&#x27;s voice in the film was dubbed by Gale Garnett, who went uncredited. Niven raved about working with the actress, telling her, &quot;After spaghetti, you&#x27;re Italy&#x27;s happiest invention.&quot;
In 1964, Cardinale starred alongside Rod Steiger and Shelley Winters in Francesco Maselli&#x27;s Italian-made &quot;Time of Indifference&quot;. Thereafter, she spent three years in the United States, where she starred in several Hollywood films. She told of how she benefited from the arrangement, explaining it was an American initiative at a time when they invited all the successful European actresses to perform in their pictures, hoping to create a monopoly. Many suffered from the experience, but she was able to hold her own: &quot;I took care of my own interests, blankly refusing to sign an exclusive contract with Universal Studios. I only signed for individual films. In the end, everything worked out fine for me. She first starred in the Henry Hathaway&#x27;s Hollywood picture &quot;Circus World&quot; (1964) opposite John Wayne and Rita Hayworth, playing the daughter of Hayworth, who performs with her as a mother-daughter circus act. By the end of the decade, she had returned to making films primarily in Italy, accepting a pay cut, turning her back on Hollywood stardom. Cardinale has further said, &quot;I don&#x27;t like the star system. I&#x27;m a normal person. I like to live in Europe. I mean, I&#x27;ve been going to Hollywood many, many times, but I didn&#x27;t want to sign a contract.&quot; Film writer David Simpson notes that as a result, &quot;Cardinale never achieved the same level of fame as Loren and Gina Lollobrigida&quot;, although she appeared in a higher number of decent films.

In 1964, she also played the lead role in &quot;The Magnificent Cuckold&quot;, based on the Belgian play &quot;Le Cocu magnifique&quot;. She was at the height of her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back unpleasant memories for her as she experienced little empathy with the director Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Vaghe stelle dell&#x27;Orsa&quot;, known as &quot;Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights)&quot; in the US and &quot;Of These Thousand Pleasures&quot; in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures&#x27;s &quot;Blindfold&quot;, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very protective of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she never managed to feel at home there.

By 1966, Cardinale was being cited as the most popular film star in Italy, even more than Mastroianni and Loren. &quot;Life&quot; stated that &quot;the Cardinale appeal is a blend of solid simplicity and radiant sensuality. It moves men all over the world to imagine her both as an exciting mistress and wife.&quot; However, following her success in Hollywood, she began to express concerns about the direction of her career. In a July 1966 interview with &quot;Life&quot;, she confessed her fear of being overglamourized and exploited, like Sophia Loren, and although she had several further US films lined up, stated: &quot;If I have to give up the money, I give it up. I do not want to become a cliché.&quot;

In 1966, a photograph of Cardinale was featured in the original gatefold artwork to Bob Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; (1966), but it was used without her permission and removed from later pressings. That year, she starred in Mark Robson&#x27;s war picture &quot;Lost Command&quot; for Columbia Pictures opposite Anthony Quinn, Alain Delon, and George Segal. Quinn expressed his love of working with Cardinale, stating that although he adored Cardinale and Loren equally, &quot;I relate easier to Claudia; Sophia creates an impression of something larger than life, something unobtainable. But Claudia – she&#x27;s not easy, still she&#x27;s within reach&quot;. She also played a Mexican marquessa in Richard Brooks&#x27; Western &quot;The Professionals&quot;, uniting her on screen once again with Burt Lancaster in what she considered to be her best American film. The following year, she appeared in &quot;Una rosa per tutti&quot; (&quot;A Rose for Everyone&quot;) and in Alexander Mackendrick&#x27;s sex farce &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot; opposite Tony Curtis. Although occasional funny moments were noted, &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot; was generally panned by the critics and the lack of chemistry with co-star Curtis was highlighted. Leonard Maltin, though, described the film as &quot;a gem&quot;.

At the beginning of 1967, Cristaldi joined her in the United States. While the two were staying in Atlanta, he surprised her by taking her to their wedding ceremony, which he had arranged without her knowledge. She went ahead with the ceremony, but was concerned about sacrificing the rights she had to her child Patrick. She also realised she was increasingly unable to make decisions about her own life. The marriage was never made official in Italy.

In 1968, Cardinale featured opposite Franco Nero in &quot;The Day of the Owl&quot;, in a David di Donatello for Best Actress-winning performance. She reunited with Rock Hudson in the Italian-made criminal comedy &quot;A Fine Pair&quot; under director Francesco Maselli. She also appeared alongside Rod Taylor in &quot;The Hell with Heroes&quot; and starred in one of her best-known roles as former prostitute Jill McBain in Sergio Leone&#x27;s epic Western &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;. Such was the power of her performance as the whore that Leone&#x27;s biographer Robert C. Cumbow described her as &quot;permanently engraved in cinematic history&quot; and noted how suited to the role she was: &quot;Her sex-goddess appearance combines with her more mystical iconographic associations to ease the progress of Jill from tart to town builder, from harlot to earth mother, from sinner to symbol of America—the apotheosis of the harlot with a heart of gold.&quot; In 1969, Cardinale starred opposite Nino Manfredi in Luigi Magni&#x27;s &quot;Nell&#x27;anno del Signore&quot;, based on the actual story of the capital execution of two &quot;carbonari&quot; in papal Rome. This was followed by a role as a telephone operator in &quot;Certo certissimo ... anzi probabile&quot;, and as a nurse opposite Sean Connery and Peter Finch in Mikhail Kalatozov&#x27;s &quot;The Red Tent&quot;, based on the story of the mission to rescue Umberto Nobile and the other survivors of the crash of the Airship Italia.

===1970s===

In 1970, Cardinale starred opposite Peter McEnery and Eli Wallach in Jerzy Skolimowski&#x27;s comedy film &quot;The Adventures of Gerard&quot;, based on &quot;The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard&quot; by Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1971, she formed a duo with Brigitte Bardot in the French Western-comedy &quot;The Legend of Frenchie King&quot;, and appeared as a prostitute opposite Alberto Sordi in Luigi Zampa&#x27;s comedy &quot;A Girl in Australia&quot;. The film, shot on location in February and March 1971, earned Cardinale a Best Actress award at the David di Donatello Awards the following year. In 1972, Cardinale appeared in Marco Ferreri&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;udienza&quot;, which was screened at the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival. She also featured in &quot;La Scoumoune&quot; with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Michel Constantin. After a role as a Russian aristocrat opposite Oliver Reed in &quot;One Russian Summer&quot; (1973), set in prerevolutionary Russia, Cardinale starred opposite Franco Nero in &quot;I guappi&quot; (1974), a historical drama film with &quot;poliziotteschi&quot; and &quot;noir&quot; elements. Cardinale and the director Pasquale Squitieri met for the first time on set, and he soon became her husband.
In 1975, Cardinale played the daughter of a political exile (Adolfo Celi) in Mauro Bolognini&#x27;s &quot;Libera, My Love&quot;, a character who becomes &quot;increasingly incensed by the fascist government of Italy and makes a number of bold and very personal gestures against it&quot;. Later that year she appeared in the comedies &quot;The Immortal Bachelor&quot; with Vittorio Gassman and &quot;Blonde in Black Leather&quot; with Monica Vitti. Vitti&#x27;s biographer noted how Cardinale and Vitti stood out as the female duo in a predominantly masculine cast.
In 1976, Cardinale appeared in the sex comedy &quot;A Common Sense of Modesty&quot;, which was directed and written by Alberto Sordi, who also co-starred. The following year, she had a biblical role as the adulteress in the &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; miniseries, which featured Robert Powell as Jesus, Anne Bancroft as Mary Magdalene, and Ernest Borgnine as Cornelius the Centurion. Cardinale starred in her husband&#x27;s &quot;Il prefetto di ferro&quot;, which tells the story of Cesare Mori (Giuliano Gemma), an Italian prefect that before and during the Fascist period was best known as &quot;the Iron Prefect&quot;. The film shared the 1978 David di Donatello for Best Film award with &quot;In nome del Papa Re&quot;. In 1978, Cardinale appeared in Damiano Damiani&#x27;s political thriller, &quot;Goodbye &amp; Amen – L&#x27;uomo della CIA&quot;, and again featured alongside Gemma in her husband&#x27;s gangster picture, &quot;Corleone&quot;, set in 1950s Sicily.
After a role in another Squitieri film in 1978, &quot;L&#x27;arma&quot;, Cardinale portrayed Eleana, a Greek &quot;gutsy brothel madame&quot; and the girlfriend of Telly Savalas in George P. Cosmatos&#x27;s adventure war film, &quot;Escape to Athena&quot; (1979). The film, shot on location in Rhodes, was poorly received; it holds a 32% &quot;rotten&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes .

===1980s===
After a role in &quot;Si salvi chi vuole&quot; (1980), and a smaller part in Peter Zinner&#x27;s &quot;The Salamander&quot; opposite Franco Nero, Anthony Quinn, and Christopher Lee, Cardinale played the love interest of Marcello Mastroianni in Liliana Cavani&#x27;s war picture &quot;The Skin&quot;, a film which also reunited her with Burt Lancaster. &quot;The Skin&quot; was entered into the 1981 Cannes Film Festival. In 1982, Cardinale appeared in Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, playing a successful brothel owner who funds Klaus Kinski&#x27;s purchase of an old steamship in South America. The film, inspired by the story of Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Fermín Fitzcarrald, was shot on location in Brazil and Peru. The film was critically acclaimed, with Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;a fine, quirky, fascinating movie&quot; and a &quot;stunning spectacle&quot;, comparing the dynamic between Kinski and Cardinale to Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The African Queen&quot;. He pointed out that although Cardinale&#x27;s screen time in the film was not substantial, she set its comic tone; he praised the way she managed to turn Kinski, renowned for his volatile temperament and portrayals of megalomaniacs and criminals, into a &quot;genuinely charming screen presence&quot;, adding a new dimension to his acting career. Later that year, Cardinale played opposite Pierre Mondy in the sex farce &quot;Le Cadeau&quot;, a role which biographers Lancia and Minelli say was played with a &quot;mature charm and expressiveness&quot;.

In 1983, Cardinale had a role in the Waris Hussein miniseries &quot;Princess Daisy&quot;, and featured alongside Lino Ventura and Bernard Giraudeau in the French-Canadian film &quot;Le Ruffian&quot;. In 1984, she played the love interest of Marcello Mastroianni in a Marco Bellocchio production of &quot;Henry IV&quot;, based on the Luigi Pirandello play of the same name. It was entered into the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. Squitieri&#x27;s &quot;Claretta&quot; (1984), featuring Cardinale and Gemma, was entered into the competition at the 41st Venice International Film Festival. Cardinale&#x27;s performance as Claretta Petacci garnered her the Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Actress. In 1985, Cardinale starred opposite Ben Gazzara and Lina Sastri in Alberto Bevilacqua&#x27;s &quot;La donna delle meraviglie&quot;. It entered the competition at the 1985 Venice International Film Festival.

In 1986, Cardinale was involved in the making of two films for television. In Comencini&#x27;s &quot;La storia&quot; (from Elsa Morante&#x27;s novel), Cardinale portrayed a widow raising a son during World War II. In her husband&#x27;s &quot;Naso di Cane&quot;, a miniseries, Enrico Lancia and Roberto Poppi praised her for her &quot;light comic touch&quot;. In 1987, Cardinale starred opposite Peter Coyote, Greta Scacchi, and Jamie Lee Curtis in Diane Kurys&#x27;s film &quot;A Man in Love&quot; (&quot;Un homme amoureux&quot;), Kurys&#x27;s first English-language feature. It was entered into the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. Cardinale&#x27;s performance as Scacchi&#x27;s cancer-stricken mother was praised by critics, with Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; highlighting the &quot;warm and radiant&quot; elements that she brought to the role, and Hal Hinson, also of &quot;The Post&quot;, comparing Scacchi to having &quot;the same kind of sensuality that Cardinale brought to her earlier roles&quot;. After a role in the comedy, &quot;Blu elettrico&quot; (1988), Cardinale portrayed Yolande de Polastron, a favourite of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s, in the two-part film &quot;La Révolution française&quot; in 1989. Made to celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of the French Revolution, the 360-minute Robert Enrico and Richard T. Heffron film was an international production, boasting a cast which included Klaus Maria Brandauer, Jane Seymour and Peter Ustinov.

===1990s===

In 1990, Cardinale starred opposite Bruno Cremer in Squitieri&#x27;s &quot;Atto di dolore&quot;, and appeared in the Morocco-set Soviet-Italian production, &quot;La battaglia dei tre tamburi di fuoco&quot;.
In 1991, Cardinale featured alongside Richard Berry and Omar Sharif in Henri Verneuil&#x27;s &quot;Mayrig&quot; (meaning &quot;mother&quot;), a film about the struggles of an Armenian family that emigrates to Marseille from Turkey after the Armenian genocide of 1915. Such was the success of the film that Verneuil made a sequel the following year, &quot;588, rue Paradis&quot;, also featuring the cast. Cardinale was praised by critics for her role as the mother; the Armenian General Benevolent Union of America noted the &quot;flawless performance of these intrepid actors, especially of Claudia Cardinale&quot;. In 1993, Cardinale won the Leone d&#x27;oro alla carriera award at the Venice Film Festival, in which she was honoured along with Roman Polanski, Robert De Niro, and Steven Spielberg. Cardinale agreed to reunite with Blake Edwards, Herbert Lom, and Burt Kwouk to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; by making &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot;. It was Edward&#x27;s last film, but was a critical and commercial failure, with critics despairing at the &quot;painfully unfunny script&quot; and the performance of Roberto Benigni as Clouseau, which earned him the Razzie Award for Worst New Star. , it has a rating of just 6% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews.
In 1994, Cardinale had a role in Charlotte Dubreuil&#x27;s &quot;Elles ne pensent qu&#x27;à ça...&quot;, and the following year appeared in the French TV serial &quot;10-07: L&#x27;affaire Zeus&quot;.

In 1997, Cardinale featured in the British-Italian television drama miniseries &quot;Nostromo&quot;, directed by Alastair Reid and produced by Fernando Ghia of Pixit Productions, a co-production with Radiotelevisione Italiana, Televisión Española, and WGBH Boston. It is described as &quot;an adaptation of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s epic story &quot;Nostromo&quot; of political upheaval, greed, and romance in turn-of-the-20th-century South America.&quot; Cardinale and the cast were nominated for an ALMA Award for Outstanding Latino/a Cast in a Made-for-Television Movie or Mini-Series. Later in 1997, Cardinale appeared in the films &quot;Sous les pieds des femmes&quot; and her husband&#x27;s &quot;Stupor Mundi&quot;, in which she portrayed Constance of Aragon. In 1998, Cardinale portrayed the mother of Lola Naymark in the French picture &quot;Riches, belles, etc.&quot;, a wealthy baroness who leaves her hotel to her daughter to care for during her absence. The following year, Cardinale played the peasant mother of two children who are members of Carmine Crocco&#x27;s (Enrico Lo Verso&#x27;s) army during the Garibaldi era, in Cristaldi&#x27;s historical film &quot;Li chiamarono... briganti!&quot;. Poorly received, the film was boycotted, and the producers have since refused to assign the broadcasting rights.

===2000s===

In 2000, Cardinale embarked on her stage career, starring in Maurizio Scaparro&#x27;s stage production of &quot;La Venexiana&quot;, adapted by René de Ceccatty, at the Théâtre du Rond-Point in Paris.
She also appeared in her husband&#x27;s television film, &quot;Élisabeth - Ils sont tous nos enfants&quot;. Two years later, Cardinale went on a theatrical tour of Italy, performing in Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Come tu mi vuoi&quot;, which Squitieri directed. She appeared as what Roger Ebert described as a &quot;faded countess&quot; opposite Jeremy Irons in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s thriller film &quot;And Now... Ladies and Gentlemen&quot;, portraying a character who spends her time in Fez, Morocco, with handsome gigolos. The film was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;And Now... Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; received mixed reviews; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; dismissed it as &quot;sublimely silly&quot;, but praised the &quot;impeccable CinemaScope compositions&quot; and the &quot;lush, suave score&quot; by Michel Legrand.

In 2005, Cardinale appeared in a Philippe Adrien stage production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, and in the 2006/2007 season also featured in another Williams play, &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, directed by Andrea Liberovici, in which she played the character of Amanda. In 2007, Cardinale appeared in the Aline Issermann comedy film &quot;Cherche fiancé tous frais payés&quot;, opposite Alexandra Lamy and Bruno Salomone, in a role which Patrick Besson described as &quot;atrocious&quot;. After a role in the TV movie &quot;Hold-up à l&#x27;italienne&quot; (2008), the following year Cardinale starred in the critically acclaimed &quot;The String&quot;, playing a Tunisian mother who has a tempestuous relationship with her French-educated gay son. Michael D. Klemm of cinemaqueer.com reflected on how the film broke many of the taboos with interracial sexuality and homosexuality. He praised Cardinale&#x27;s &quot;terrific&quot; acting and portrayal of the &quot;overbearing&quot; mother, likening one scene, where she &quot;brings home a nice girl for Malik (Antonin Stahly) to meet&quot;, to &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; (1971).

===2010s===
In 2010, Cardinale received the Golden Orange Best Actress Award at the 47th Antalya &quot;Golden Orange&quot; International Film Festival for her performance as an elderly Italian woman who takes in a young Turkish exchange student in &quot;Signora Enrica&quot;. The Turkish-Italian co-production was shot in locations in Istanbul and Rimini.

In 2012, Cardinale featured opposite Jeanne Moreau and Michael Lonsdale in the final feature film to be directed by Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira, &quot;Gebo and the Shadow&quot;. Critically acclaimed, it has a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and was shown at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described it as the &quot;ensemble of superb older performers who comprise the remainder of the dramatis personae&quot;. Another excellent film in which Cardinale acted, released in 2012, was &quot;The Artist and the Model&quot;. In it, she starred along with Jean Rochefort. In 2013, Cardinale starred alongside supporting actresses Patricia Black and Chloé Cunha in Nadia Szold&#x27;s &quot;Joy de V.&quot;, and had a role in Ernst Gossner&#x27;s war drama &quot;The Silent Mountain&quot;, a love story set in the Dolomite Mountains at the outbreak of World War I between Italy and Austria-Hungary in 1915. Gossner described her as &quot;a terrific spirit on the set&quot;, and noted that Cardinale told the production team &quot;legendary stories&quot; about Marcello Mastroianni. In 2014, Cardinale portrayed a &quot;sympathetic Italian chaperone&quot; viscountess in the British period drama film &quot;Effie Gray&quot;, which was written by Emma Thompson (whom Cardinale shares birthday with) and featured Dakota Fanning in the lead role. While promoting &quot;Effie Gray&quot;, in an interview Cardinale said: &quot;I still continue to work, it&#x27;s 142 movies now. Usually when you are old you don&#x27;t work any more, but I still work, which is good... I&#x27;ve been very lucky because I&#x27;ve had many fantastic directors with me, Fellini, Visconti, Blake Edwards, lots and lots...&quot;.

On 11 October 2018 she received the Tabernas de Cine award in the Almería Western Film Festival.

===2020s===
In 2020, Cardinale headlined the Swiss miniseries &quot;Bulle&quot;. Later that year, she had a role in the Netflix film &quot;Rogue City&quot;. In its debut weekend, it was the second most-streamed film on the site.

==Personal life==
Claudia Cardinale met the Italian film producer Franco Cristaldi in 1958. According to Cardinale, the couple had a marriage party but did not marry, and they became increasingly detached. Cristaldi later married Zeudi Araya and had no further relationship with Cardinale.

Cardinale lived with Pasquale Squitieri, an Italian film director, for 42 years, from 1975 until Squitieri died on 18 February 2017, aged 78.

Cardinale has two children: Patrick, who was born when she was 19 and later adopted by Cristaldi, and Claudia, whom she had with Squitieri.

Cardinale is fluent in Arabic, French, Italian, English, and Spanish. Her niece Francesca is also an actress.

Cardinale is a political liberal who has supported feminist causes over the years. Although she lives in Paris, Cardinale is fiercely outspoken about being identified as an Italian. She has been a UNESCO goodwill ambassador for the Defence of Women&#x27;s Rights since March 2000, and was a goodwill ambassador for the UNESCO World Water Day for 2006.

Cardinale published an autobiography with Anne Mori, &quot;Io Claudia, Tu Claudia&quot;, in 1995. She has been a regular attendee of the Academy Awards. Her awards have included an honorary Golden Lion at the 1993 Venice Film Festival, and an Honorary Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival. The &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot;, in a February 2011 online feature, named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history. Cardinale said of her acting, &quot;I never felt scandal and confession were necessary to be an actress. I&#x27;ve never revealed myself or even my body in films. Mystery is very important.&quot; In a 2014 interview, she revealed her secret of success: &quot;If you want to practise this craft, you have to have inner strength. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll lose your idea of who you are. Every film I make entails becoming a different woman. And in front of a camera, no less! But when I&#x27;m finished, I&#x27;m me again.&quot;

<doc id="235309" wikidata="Q229276" url="?curid=235309" title="Maureen O'Hara">
<text>Maureen O&#x27;Hara (; 17 August 1920 – 24 October 2015) was an Irish-born naturalized American actress who became successful in Hollywood from the 1940s through to the 1960s. She was a natural redhead who was known for playing passionate but sensible heroines, often in Westerns and adventure films. She worked with director John Ford and long-time friend John Wayne on numerous projects.

O&#x27;Hara was born into a Catholic family and raised in Dublin, Ireland. She aspired to become an actress from a very young age. She trained with the Rathmines Theatre Company from the age of 10 and at the Abbey Theatre from the age of 14. She was given a screen test, which was deemed unsatisfactory, but Charles Laughton saw potential in her, and arranged for her to co-star with him in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; in 1939. Laughton insisted that she change her last name from FitzSimons against her wishes, and she became &quot;O&#x27;Hara&quot;. She moved to Hollywood the same year to appear with him in the production of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, and was given a contract by RKO Pictures. From there, she went on to enjoy a long and highly successful career, and acquired the nickname &quot;the Queen of Technicolor&quot;.

O&#x27;Hara appeared in films such as &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941) (her first collaboration with John Ford), &quot;The Black Swan&quot; with Tyrone Power (1942), &quot;The Spanish Main&quot; (1945), &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; (1947), the Christmas classic &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947) with John Payne and Natalie Wood, and &quot;Comanche Territory&quot; (1950). O&#x27;Hara made her first film with John Wayne, the actor with whom she is most closely associated, in &quot;Rio Grande&quot; (1950); this was followed by &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot; (1957), &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963) and &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971). Such was her strong chemistry with Wayne that many assumed they were married or in a relationship. In the 1960s, O&#x27;Hara increasingly turned to more motherly roles as she aged, appearing in films such as &quot;The Deadly Companions&quot; (1961), &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Rare Breed&quot; (1966). She retired from the industry in 1971, but returned 20 years later to appear with John Candy in &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (1991).

In the late 1970s, O&#x27;Hara helped run her third husband Charles F. Blair Jr.&#x27;s flying business in Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, and edited a magazine, but later sold them to spend more time in Glengarriff in Ireland. She was married three times, and had one daughter, Bronwyn, with her second husband. Her autobiography, &quot;″Tis Herself&quot;, published in 2004, became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. In 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; named her one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination. In November 2014, she was presented with an Honorary Academy Award with the inscription &quot;To Maureen O&#x27;Hara, one of Hollywood&#x27;s brightest stars, whose inspiring performances glowed with passion, warmth and strength&quot;. In 2020, she was ranked number one on &quot;The Irish Times&quot; list of Ireland&#x27;s greatest film actors.

==Early life and education==

Born on 17 August 1920, O&#x27;Hara began life as Maureen FitzSimons on Beechwood Avenue in the Dublin suburb of Ranelagh. She stated that she was &quot;born into the most remarkable and eccentric family I could have possibly hoped for&quot;. She was the second eldest of six children of Charles and Marguerite (née Lilburn) FitzSimons, and the only red-headed child in the family. Her father was in the clothing business and bought into Shamrock Rovers Football Club, a team O&#x27;Hara supported from childhood.

O&#x27;Hara inherited her singing voice from her mother, a former operatic contralto and successful women&#x27;s clothier, who in her younger years was widely considered to have been one of Ireland&#x27;s most beautiful women. She noted that whenever her mother left the house, men would leave their houses just so they could catch a glimpse of her in the street. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s siblings were Peggy, the eldest, and younger Charles, Florrie, Margot and Jimmy. Peggy dedicated her life to a religious order, becoming a Sister of Charity.
O&#x27;Hara earned the nickname &quot;Baby Elephant&quot; for being a pudgy infant. A tomboy, she enjoyed fishing in the River Dodder, riding horses, swimming and soccer, and would play boys&#x27; games and climb trees.

O&#x27;Hara was so keen on soccer that at one point, she pressed her father to found a women&#x27;s team, and professed that Glenmalure Park, the home ground of Shamrock Rovers F.C., became &quot;like a second home&quot;. She enjoyed fighting, and trained in judo as a teenager. She later admitted that she was jealous of boys in her youth and the freedom they had, and that they could steal apples from orchards and not get into trouble.

O&#x27;Hara first attended the John Street West Girls&#x27; School near Thomas Street in Dublin&#x27;s Liberties Area. She began dancing at the age of 5, when a fortune teller predicted that she would become rich and famous, and she would boast to friends as they sat in her back garden that she would &quot;become the most famous actress in the world&quot;. Her enthusiastic family fully supported the idea. When she recited a poem on stage in school at the age of six, O&#x27;Hara immediately felt an attraction to performing in front of an audience. From that age she trained in drama, music and dance along with her siblings at the Ena Mary Burke School of Drama and Elocution in Dublin. Their affinity with the arts prompted O&#x27;Hara to refer to the family as the &quot;Irish von Trapp family&quot;.
At the age of 10, O&#x27;Hara joined the Rathmines Theatre Company and began working in amateur theatre in the evenings after her lessons. One of her earliest roles was Robin Hood in a Christmas pantomime. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s dream at this time was to be a stage actress. By the age of 12, O&#x27;Hara had reached the height of , and it worried her mother for a while that she would become &quot;the tallest girl&quot; in Ireland as Maureen&#x27;s father was . She expressed relief when O&#x27;Hara only grew another two inches.

At the age of 14, O&#x27;Hara joined the Abbey Theatre. Though she was mentored by playwright Lennox Robinson, she found her time at the theatre disappointing. In 1934, at the age of 15, she won the first Dramatic Prize of the national competition of the performing arts, the Dublin Feis Award, for her performance as Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. She trained as a shorthand typist, working for Crumlin Laundry before joining Eveready Battery Company, where she worked as a typist and bookkeeper. She later put her skills to use when she typed the script of &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; for John Ford.

In 1936, she became the youngest pupil to graduate from the Guildhall School of Music at the time, and the following year, she won the Dawn Beauty Competition, winning £50. As she matured into a young woman, O&#x27;Hara, like many actresses, became increasingly self-conscious, which affected her for a while. In one performance, which was watched by her father from the back of the theatre, O&#x27;Hara &quot;sensed there was someone out front watching me, perhaps critically. My arms felt like lead. I gave a rotten show that night. I grew up with the terrible feeling that I was being laughed at&quot;.

==Film career==

===1937–1940: Early career===
At the age of 17, O&#x27;Hara was offered her first major role at the Abbey Theatre, but was distracted by the attentions of actor-singer Harry Richman. Richman arranged with the manager of the Gresham Hotel in Dublin to meet her at the hotel while she was dining with her family. He proposed that she go to Elstree Studios for a screen test and become a film actress. O&#x27;Hara arrived in London shortly afterwards with her mother. During the screen test, the studio adorned her in a &quot;gold lamé dress with flapping sleeves like wings&quot; and heavy makeup with an ornate hair style, which was deemed to be far from satisfactory. O&#x27;Hara detested the audition, during which she had to walk in and pick up a telephone. She recalled thinking to herself, &quot;My God, get me back to the Abbey&quot;. Charles Laughton later saw the test and, despite the overdone makeup and costume, was intrigued, paying particular notice to her large and expressive eyes. After seeking the approval of his business partner Erich Pommer, they arranged to meet O&#x27;Hara through a talent agency run by Connie Chapman and Vere Barker. Laughton was impressed with O&#x27;Hara, particularly by her lack of nerves and refusal to read an extract upon his request unprepared, during which she said: &quot;I am very sorry but absolutely no&quot;. She was offered an initial seven-year contract with their new company, Mayflower Pictures. Though her family were shocked at her being given a contract so young, they accepted, and O&#x27;Hara traveled across Ireland in celebration before arriving back in London to commence her film career. O&#x27;Hara later stated that &quot;I owe my whole career to Mr. Pommer&quot;.
O&#x27;Hara made her screen debut in Walter Forde&#x27;s &quot;Kicking the Moon Around&quot; (1938), although she did not consider it a part of her filmography. Richman had introduced her to Forde at Elstree Studios, but as she was not cast in the film in a notable role, she agreed to deliver one line in it as a favor to Richman for helping with her screen test. Laughton arranged for her to appear in the low-budget musical &quot;My Irish Molly&quot; (1938), the only film she made under her real name, Maureen FitzSimons. In the film, she plays a woman named Eiléen O&#x27;Shea, who rescues an orphan girl named Molly. Biographer Aubrey Malone stated of it: &quot;One could argue that O&#x27;Hara never looked as enticing as she does in &quot;Little Miss Molly&quot;, even if she isn&#x27;t &#x27;Maureen O&#x27;Hara&#x27; quite yet. She wears no makeup, and there&#x27;s no Hollywood glamour, but despite (or because of?) that, she is rapturously beautiful. Her accent is thick, which is perhaps why she didn&#x27;t mention the film much. It also looks as if it were made in the 1920s rather than the 1930s, so primitive are the sets and characters&quot;. Malone added that though the lot was &quot;ham-fisted&quot;, it is a &quot;quaint film which O&#x27;Hara scholars should view if only to see early evidence of her natural instinct for dramatic timing and scene interpretation&quot;.

O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s first major film role was that of Mary Yellen in &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1939), directed by Alfred Hitchcock and co-starring Laughton. O&#x27;Hara portrayed the innkeeper&#x27;s niece, an orphan who goes to live with her aunt and uncle at a Cornish tavern, a heroine which she describes as &quot;torn between the love of her family and her love for a lawman in disguise&quot;. Laughton insisted that she change her name to the shorter &quot;O&#x27;Mara&quot; or &quot;O&#x27;Hara&quot;, and she eventually decided on the latter after expressing contempt at both. When she said &quot;I like Maureen FitzSimons and I want to keep it&quot;, Laughton replied with, &quot;Very well, you&#x27;re Maureen O&#x27;Hara.&quot; (O&#x27;Hara would later say that &quot;nobody would ever get [FitzSimons] straight.&quot;) O&#x27;Hara noted that Laughton had always wanted a daughter of his own, and treated her as such, and she later stated that Laughton&#x27;s death in 1962 was like losing a parent. She worked well under Hitchcock, professing to have &quot;never experienced the strange feeling of detachment with Hitchcock that many other actors claimed to have felt while working with him.&quot; On the contrary, Laughton was engaged in a bitter battle with Hitchcock throughout the production and resented many of Hitchcock&#x27;s ideas, including changing the nature of the villain from the novel. Though &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; is generally seen by critics and the director himself as one of his weakest films, O&#x27;Hara was praised, with one critic stating &quot;the newcomer, Maureen O&#x27;Hara is charming to look at and distinct promise as an actress&quot;. Seeing the film was an eyeopener for O&#x27;Hara and change in self-perception, having always seen herself as a tomboy and realizing that on screen she was a woman of great beauty to others. When she returned to Ireland briefly after the film was completed it dawned on her that life would never be the same again, and she was hurt when she attempted to make pleasant conversation to some local girls and they rejected her advances, considering her to be very arrogant.

Laughton was so pleased with O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s performance in &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; that she was cast opposite him in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s agent, Lew Wasserman, arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As the new face of RKO, she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something that made her uncomfortable, as she felt that she was being viewed as a &quot;novelty&quot; and &quot;people were making a fuss over me because of something I hadn&#x27;t yet done, something they just thought I &quot;might&quot; do&quot;. O&#x27;Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O&#x27;Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, at a time when it was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O&#x27;Hara described it as a &quot;physically demanding shoot&quot;, due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, &quot;Good God, Charles. Is that really you?&quot; O&#x27;Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O&#x27;Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic thought that was the strength of the film, writing: &quot;The contrast between Laughton as the pathetic hunchback and O&#x27;Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired&quot;.

After the completion of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, World War II began, and Laughton, realizing his company could no longer film in London, sold O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s contract to RKO. O&#x27;Hara later professed that this &quot;broke my heart, I felt completely abandoned in a strange and faraway place&quot;. She next featured in John Farrow&#x27;s &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot; (1940), a remake of George Cukor&#x27;s 1932 film. O&#x27;Hara portrayed Sydney Fairchild, who was played by Katharine Hepburn in the original, in a film which she considered to have had a &quot;screenplay [which] was mediocre at best&quot;. The production became difficult for O&#x27;Hara after Farrow reportedly made &quot;suggestive comments&quot; to her and began stalking her at home; once he realized that O&#x27;Hara was not interested in him sexually, he began bullying her on set. O&#x27;Hara punched him in the jaw one day, which put an end to the mistreatment. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s performance was criticized by reviewers, with the critic from &quot;The New York Sun&quot; writing that she &quot;lacked the intensity and desperation it must have; nor does she seem to have a sparkle of humor&quot;. She next found a role as an aspiring ballerina who performs with a dance troupe in &quot;Dance, Girl, Dance&quot; (1940). She considered it to have been a physically demanding film, and felt intimidated by Lucille Ball during the production as she had been a former Ziegfeld and Goldwyn girl and was a superior dancer. The two remained friends for many years after the film was completed.

===1941–1943: Hollywood breakthrough===

O&#x27;Hara began 1941 by appearing in &quot;They Met in Argentina&quot;, RKO&#x27;s answer to &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; (1940). O&#x27;Hara later declared that she &quot;knew it was going to be a stinker; terrible script, bad director, preposterous plot, forgettable music&quot;. She grew increasingly frustrated with the direction of her career at this time. Ida Zeitlin wrote that O&#x27;Hara had &quot;reached a pitch of despair where she was about ready to throw in the towel, to break her contract, to collapse against the stone wall of indifference and howl like a baby wolf&quot;. She pleaded with her agent for a role, however small, in John Ford&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941), at 20th Century Fox, a film about a close, hard-working Welsh mining family living in the heart of the South Wales Valleys in the 19th century. The film, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, began an artistic collaboration with Ford that would span 20 years and five feature films.

Her substantial role as Angharad, which she was given without a full-screen test, beating Katharine Hepburn and Gene Tierney to the part, proved to be her breakthrough role. It was made possible by a change to her contract with RKO, in which Fox bought the rights to feature O&#x27;Hara in one film each year. Ford developed a nickname for her, &quot;Rosebud&quot;, and the two developed a long but turbulent friendship, with O&#x27;Hara often visiting Ford and his wife Mary in social visits and spending time aboard his yacht &quot;Araner&quot;. Despite this, Ford was an unpredictable character with a mean streak, and in one instance he punched O&#x27;Hara in the jaw for some unknown reason, and she only took it from him because she wanted to show him she could take a punch like a man. The production of &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; was originally intended to be shot in the Rhondda Valley, but due to the war it had to be filmed in the San Fernando Valley, on a $1.25 million set, which took 150 builders six months to complete.

O&#x27;Hara recalled that Ford would allow her to improvise extensively during the filming, but was very much the boss, commenting that &quot;nobody dared step out of line, which gave the performers a sense of security&quot;. O&#x27;Hara became such good friends with Anna Lee during the shooting that she later named her daughter Bronwyn after Lee&#x27;s character. The film was lauded by the critics, and was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture. Both O&#x27;Hara and co-star Walter Pidgeon, who played the minister, were praised for their performances, with &quot;Variety&quot; writing that &quot;Maureen O&#x27;Hara splendid as the object of his unrequited love, who marries the mine owner&#x27;s son out of pique&quot;.

Film historian Joseph McBride considered O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s performance to have been the most emotionally powerful he&#x27;d seen since Katharine Hepburn in &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot; (1936). O&#x27;Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, &quot;I make my way down the steps to the carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up above my head and points to the heavens. It&#x27;s breathtaking.&quot;

Malone notes that when the United States entered World War II in 1941, many of the better actors became involved in the war effort and O&#x27;Hara struggled to find good co-stars. He points out that she increasingly starred in adventure pictures, which allowed her to develop her acting and keep her profile high in Hollywood. O&#x27;Hara had next intended appearing opposite Tyrone Power in &quot;Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake&quot;, but was hospitalized in early 1942, during which she had her appendix and two ovarian cysts removed at Reno Hospital. Producer Zanuck scoffed at the operation, thinking it was an excuse for a break. He passed it off as &quot;probably a fragment left over from an abortion&quot;, which deeply offended her, as a devout Catholic.

O&#x27;Hara instead starred in the Technicolor war picture, &quot;To the Shores of Tripoli&quot;, her first Technicolor picture and first on-screen partnership with John Payne, in which she portrayed Navy nurse Lieutenant Mary Carter. Though the film was a considerable commercial success, becoming a benchmark for &quot;service pictures&quot; of the era, O&#x27;Hara later commented that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t understand why the quality of his (Bruce Humberstone&#x27;s) pictures never seemed to match their impressive box-office receipts&quot;. Malone wrote that &quot;nobody in the film seemed to have lived life. The character&#x27;s emotions, like their uniforms, seem too streamlined&quot;. O&#x27;Hara next played an unconventional role as a timid socialite who joins the army as a cook in Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;Ten Gentlemen from West Point&quot; (1942), which tells the fictional story of the first class of the United States Military Academy in the early 19th century. The film was disagreeable to O&#x27;Hara because Payne dropped out and was replaced by George Montgomery, whom she found &quot;positively loathsome&quot;. Montgomery attempted to make a pass at her during the production, prolonging his kiss with her after the director had yelled &quot;cut&quot;. 
Later that year, O&#x27;Hara starred opposite Tyrone Power, George Sanders, Laird Cregar and Anthony Quinn in Henry King&#x27;s swashbuckler &quot;The Black Swan&quot;. O&#x27;Hara recalled that it was &quot;everything you could want in a lavish pirate picture: a magnificent ship with thundering cannons; a dashing hero battling menacing villains ... sword fights; fabulous costumes ...&quot;. She found it exhilarating working with Power, who was renowned for his &quot;wicked sense of humor&quot;. O&#x27;Hara grew very concerned about one scene in the picture in which she is thrown overboard in her underwear by Power, and sent a warning letter home to Ireland in advance. She refused to take her wedding ring off in one scene which resulted in screen adjustments to make it look like a dinner ring. Though the film was praised by critics and is seen as one of the period&#x27;s most enjoyable adventure films, the critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s character lacked depth, commenting that &quot;Maureen O&#x27;Hara is brunette and beautiful—which is all the part requires&quot;.

O&#x27;Hara played the love interest of Henry Fonda in the 1943 war picture &quot;Immortal Sergeant&quot;. O&#x27;Hara noted that Fonda was studying for his service entry exams at the time and had his head in books between takes, and that 20th Century Fox publicized one of the last love scenes between them in the film as Fonda&#x27;s last screen kiss before entering the war. She next portrayed a European school teacher opposite George Sanders and Charles Laughton, in their last film together, in Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Mine&quot; for RKO. At the end of a court case in the film, during a hearty speech by Laughton, O&#x27;Hara is shown teary-eyed on screen for a prolonged period. Malone thought her performance was effective, both crying and smiling, though considered Renoir to have overdone the film and confused the audience as a result.

Later, she had a role in Richard Wallace&#x27;s &quot;The Fallen Sparrow&quot; opposite John Garfield, whom she described as &quot;my shortest leading man, an outspoken Communist and a real sweetheart&quot;. Malone notes though that despite them getting on very well, Garfield did not rate her as an actress. He considers &quot;This Land is Mine&quot; and &quot;The Fallen Sparrow&quot; to have been two important pictures in O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s career, &quot;adding to her growing prestige in the film industry&quot;, helping her &quot;crawl out from the gimcrack melodrama of adventure films&quot;.

===1944–1949: The Queen of Technicolor===
Although O&#x27;Hara became known as the &quot;Queen of Technicolor&quot; (like Rhonda Fleming), she professed to dislike the process because it required special cameras and intense light that burned her eyes and gave her klieg eye. She believed that the term negatively affected her career, as most people viewed her solely as a beauty who looked good on film, rather than as a talented actress. In 1944 O&#x27;Hara was cast opposite Joel McCrea in William A. Wellman&#x27;s biographical western &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;. Though O&#x27;Hara did not think that McCrea was rugged enough for the part of William F. &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody, and according to Malone gave her &quot;little to work off&quot;, it did well at the box office. Contrary to O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Variety&quot; was highly praising of the film, describing it as a &quot;super-western and often a tear-jerker&quot;, and thought that McCrea was convincing in the part and that O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s own performance was &quot;satisfactory&quot;.
In 1945, O&#x27;Hara starred opposite Paul Henreid in &quot;The Spanish Main&quot; as feisty noblewoman Contessa Francesca, the daughter of a Mexican viceroy. O&#x27;Hara described it as &quot;one of my more decorative roles&quot;, as her character is a particularly aggressive one among the men on a ship, and during the course of the film her face is smothered in chimney soot. O&#x27;Hara almost did not win the role when another actress falsely told RKO executive Joe Nolan that she was &quot;as big as a horse&quot; after giving birth to a daughter in 1944. Around this time &quot;an actress named Kathryn&quot; also falsely accused O&#x27;Hara of making sexual advances towards her in an elevator, which she believed was a way for the actress to gain attention at the start of her career. During the production of &quot;The Spanish Main&quot;, O&#x27;Hara was visited by John Ford, who was initially turned away for being shabbily dressed, but was later admitted. He informed her about the project that would become &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952). Malone notes that in the film O&#x27;Hara &quot;shows her determination not to leave her sexuality at the birthing stool&quot;, commenting that she looks &quot;deliciously fragrant in the splashy histrionics on view here, in RKO&#x27;s first film in the three-color Technicolor process&quot; O&#x27;Hara became a naturalized citizen of the United States on 24 January 1946, and held dual citizenship with the United States and her native Ireland.

In the same year, she portrayed an actress with a fatal heart condition in Walter Lang&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;. A commercially successful production, O&#x27;Hara described it as a &quot;rip-your-heart-out tearjerker that reduced my agents and the toughest brass at Fox to mush when they saw it&quot;. It was poorly received by critics, and was later declared by Harvard as the worst film of all time. One critic attacked O&#x27;Hara as &quot;just another one of those precious Hollywood juvenile products who in workday life would benefit from a good hiding&quot;, while Bosley Crowther dismissed the film as a &quot;compound of hackneyed situations, maudlin dialogue and preposterously bad acting&quot;. In Gregory Ratoff&#x27;s musical &quot;Do You Love Me&quot;, O&#x27;Hara portrayed a prim, bespectacled music school dean who transforms herself into a desirable, sophisticated lady in the big city. She commented that it was &quot;one of the worst pictures I ever made&quot;. It frustrated her that she could not put her talents to good use, to not even sing in it.
O&#x27;Hara was offered roles in &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1946), which went to Tierney, John Wayne&#x27;s film &quot;Tycoon&quot; (1947), which went to Laraine Day, and Bob Hope&#x27;s &quot;The Paleface&quot;, which went to Jane Russell. She turned down the role in &quot;The Paleface&quot; as she was going through a turbulent period in her personal life and &quot;didn&#x27;t think I would be able to laugh every day and have fun&quot;. She later deeply regretted turning it down and confessed that she&#x27;d made a &quot;terrible mistake&quot;. In 1947, O&#x27;Hara starred opposite Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Shireen in the adventure film &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot;. O&#x27;Hara plays a glamorous adventuress who assists Sinbad (Fairbanks) locate the hidden treasure of Alexander the Great. She found the scenario to be &quot;ridiculous&quot;, but stated that it made a &quot;pot of money for RKO—action-adventures almost always did&quot;. Malone wrote: &quot;O&#x27;Hara looks splendid and gets to wear some of the most stunning costumes of her career—a different one in almost every scene—but her dialogue is floridly empty. She exudes potential in early scenes, where her air of sybaritic slyness seems promise she&#x27;ll be something more than window dressing&quot;, but thought the film &quot;totally lacked drama&quot;. The critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought that O&#x27;Hara excessive costume changes made watching her an &quot;exhausting&quot; experience&quot;.

After a role as the Bostonian love interest of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone&#x27;s &quot;The Homestretch&quot; (1947), O&#x27;Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break to return to her native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O&#x27;Hara said: &quot;I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha ... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy&#x27;s, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls&#x27; dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly&quot;. The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.

In O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s last film of 1947, she played a Creole woman opposite Rex Harrison in John M. Stahl&#x27;s &quot;The Foxes of Harrow&quot;; the film was set in pre-Civil War New Orleans. TCM state that O&#x27;Hara had been &quot;angling&quot; to star in &quot;Forever Amber&quot; (1947), Fox&#x27;s big historical romance at the time, but believe that due to a contractual clause, neither of her joint contract owners, Fox and RKO, would accept her appearing in a &quot;major star vehicle&quot; at the time. During the production O&#x27;Hara and Harrison intensely disliked each other from the outset, and she found him to be &quot;rude, vulgar and arrogant&quot;. Harrison had thought that she disliked him simply because he was English. He reportedly belched in her face during dance sequences and accused her of anti-Semitism, being married to a Jewish woman (Lilli Palmer) at the time, which she vehemently denied. &quot;Variety&quot;, while acknowledging the length, thought that O&#x27;Hara and Harrison carried off their dramatic scenes with &quot;surprising skill&quot;. The following year, O&#x27;Hara starred opposite Robert Young in the commercially successful comedy film, &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised O&#x27;Hara and Young as husband and wife, remarking that they were &quot;delightfully clever&quot;, acting with &quot;elaborate indignation, alternating with good-natured despair&quot;.

In 1949, O&#x27;Hara played what she described as a &quot;frustrated talent manager who shoots her star client in a jealous rage&quot; opposite Melvyn Douglas in &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Secret&quot;. She only agreed to appear in the production to meet the one-picture-a-year contractual obligation to RKO. It was a box office flop and at the time not well received critically—director Nicholas Ray himself was dissatisfied with it. She next had a role as a wealthy widow who falls in love with an alcoholic artist (Dana Andrews) in the Victorian melodrama &quot;The Forbidden Street&quot;, which was shot at Shepperton Studios in London. O&#x27;Hara felt that her performance was poor and admitted that she did not have her heart set on the film. After the poorly received comedy &quot;Father Was a Fullback&quot;, dismissed by &quot;Picturegoer&quot; magazine as an &quot;unhappy mixture of Freud and football&quot;, she starred in her first film with Universal Pictures, the escapist adventure, &quot;Bagdad&quot;, portraying Princess Marjan. The film was shot on location in the Alabama Hills of Lone Pine, California. O&#x27;Hara noted that the film earned a tremendous amount of money for Universal, and its success led to Universal buying into her RKO contract. Malone wrote that she sings, dances, fights, and loves in a tale of derring-do that ticks all the requisite boxes for an opulent history lesson&quot;, adding that &quot;when it came to dexterity in action, O&#x27;Hara was a nonpareil&quot;.

===1950–1957: Work with John Ford, Westerns and adventure films===

In the 1950 Technicolor Western, &quot;Comanche Territory&quot;, O&#x27;Hara played an unusual role as the lead character of Katie Howards, a fiery saloon owner who dresses, behaves and fights like a man, with hair tied back. She &quot;mastered the American bullwhip&quot; during the filming, in a role which Crowther believed was &quot;more significant than a setting sun&quot; in that she &quot;tackles her assignment with so much relish that the rest of the cast, even the Indians, are completely subdued.&quot; She received first billing above co-star Macdonald Carey. O&#x27;Hara then appeared as Countess D&#x27;Arneau opposite John Payne in &quot;Tripoli&quot;, directed by O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s second husband, William Houston Price. She was next cast by John Ford in the Western &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, the final installment of his cavalry trilogy. It was the first of five films to be made over 22 years with John Wayne, including &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot; (1957), &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963) and &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971), the first three of which were directed by Ford. O&#x27;Hara declared that &quot;from our very first scenes together, working with John Wayne was comfortable for me&quot;. Her chemistry with Wayne was so powerful that over the years many people assumed that they were married, and newspapers occasionally published sensationalist stories from people claiming to be their love child. In April 1951, she received a call from Universal Pictures that she was cast as a Tunisian princess named Tanya in the swashbuckler film, &quot;Flame of Araby&quot; (1951). O&#x27;Hara &quot;despised&quot; the film and everything it stood for, but had no choice but to make the film or be suspended. By that time, she began to grow tired of the roles she was offered and wanted to perform roles that had more depth than the ones she had done thus far.
In 1952, O&#x27;Hara played Claire, the daughter of the musketeer, Athos, in &quot;At Sword&#x27;s Point&quot;, which according to her showed the &quot;new Maureen O&#x27;Hara&quot;. The film had actually been made in 1949 but was not released until 1952. The role was the most physically demanding of her career, doing her own stunts and training in the art of fencing for six weeks under Belgian-born fencing master Fred Cavens. She disliked director Lewis Allen and producer Howard Hughes, whom she thought was &quot;cold as ice&quot;. The critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot; appreciated O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s swordsmanship in the film, stating that she was &quot;snarling like a Fury, impales her opponents as though she were threading a needle.&quot; O&#x27;Hara next played Irish immigrant Australian-based cowgirl, Dell McGuire, in Lewis Milestone&#x27;s drama &quot;Kangaroo&quot; (1952), set during the drought of 1900. &quot;Kangaroo&quot; is noted for being the first Technicolor film to be shot on location in Australia, mostly shot in the desert near Port Augusta. Although O&#x27;Hara disliked the production due to changes made to the script, she found the Australians extremely welcoming. The Australian government offered her a plot of land during the production to own permanently, but she turned it down for political reasons, only to later discover that significant oil reserves were on the land.

In 1952, O&#x27;Hara starred opposite John Wayne again in Ford&#x27;s romantic comedy drama, &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;. Shot on location in Cong, County Mayo, Ireland, O&#x27;Hara described the film as her &quot;personal favourite of all the pictures I have made. It is the one I am most proud of, and I tend to be very protective of it. I loved Mary Kate Danaher. I loved the hell and fire in her.&quot; Malone notes that she rarely appeared in an interview without mentioning this fact. O&#x27;Hara was disconcerted with Ford&#x27;s harsh treatment of Wayne during the production and constant ribbing. Though Ford generally treated her very well, on one occasion when filming a cart scene in which the wind in her eyes made it difficult to see, Ford yelled &quot;Open your damn eyes&quot; and O&#x27;Hara flipped, responding with &quot;What would a bald-headed son of a bitch like you know about hair lashing across his eyeballs?&quot;
&quot;The Quiet Man&quot; was both a critical and commercial success, grossing $3.8 million domestically in its first year of release against a budget of $1.75 million. Film critic James Berardinelli called O&#x27;Hara &quot;the perfect match for Wayne&quot; and that &quot;she never allows him to steal a scene without a fight, and occasionally snatches one away from him on her own&quot;, while film critic and sports writer Danny Peary praised their chemistry, &quot;exhibiting strength&quot; through &quot;love, vulnerability and tenderness&quot;. According to Harry Carey Jr., who noted that O&#x27;Hara held a strong gaze with Wayne in all of the films they made together, director Ford was uncomfortable with the romantic scenes in the film and refused to shoot the scene until the last day. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, though O&#x27;Hara was devastated at not even being nominated for an award. Film director Martin Scorsese called &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; &quot;one of the greatest movies of all time&quot;, and in 1996 it topped a poll of the greatest films in the &quot;Irish Times&quot;.

O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s last release of 1952 was &quot;Against All Flags&quot; opposite Errol Flynn, marking her only collaboration with the actor. O&#x27;Hara, knowing Flynn&#x27;s reputation as a womanizer, was on close guard during the production. Though she &quot;respected him professionally and was quite fond of him personally&quot; she found Flynn&#x27;s alcoholism a problem and remarked that &quot;if the director prohibited alcohol on the set, then Errol would inject oranges with booze and eat them during breaks&quot;. According to Steve Jacques, O&#x27;Hara outdid Flynn in the combat scenes, many of which had to be cut from the final version to protect Flynn&#x27;s heroic image. The film was a commercially successful venture.

The following year she appeared in &quot;The Redhead from Wyoming&quot;, which she dismissed as &quot;another western stinkeroo for Universal&quot;, and appeared in another western with Jeff Chandler, &quot;War Arrow&quot;. O&#x27;Hara noted that &quot;Jeff was a real sweetheart, but acting with him was like acting with a broomstick&quot;.
In 1954, O&#x27;Hara starred in &quot;Malaga&quot;, also known as &quot;Fire over Africa&quot;, which was shot on location in Spain. O&#x27;Hara played a Mata Hari-like character, a secret agent who attempts to find the ringleader of a smuggling ring in Tangiers. Malone compares the relationship in the film between O&#x27;Hara as Joanne and Macdonald Carey as agent Van Logan to that of Bogart and Bacall, with frequent verbal sparring. The &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Maureen O&#x27;Hara looks very handsome in Technicolor but her expressions are limited—mostly to disgust at shooting smugglers or pulling knives from dying men&quot;.

In 1955, O&#x27;Hara made her fourth picture with Ford, &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot;, which she considered being &quot;by far the most difficult&quot; due to declining relations with John Ford. John Wayne had originally intended co-starring, but due to a conflicting schedule O&#x27;Hara recommended Tyrone Power in replacement. Malone notes that the Irish accents by O&#x27;Hara and Power are overdone, and that there is little trace of a Donegal accent in it. The film production marked the lowest point of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s relationship with Ford, and each day he would greet her with &quot;Well, did Herself have a good shit this morning?&quot;. He would ask the crew if she was in a good mood, and if that was the case, he would say &quot;then we&#x27;re going to have a horrible day&quot; and vice versa. He would provoke her by telling her to &quot;move her fat Irish ass&quot;. Their relationship deteriorated further when O&#x27;Hara reportedly saw him kissing an actor on set; Ford knew that she thought he was a closeted homosexual. In &quot;The Magnificent Matador&quot;, O&#x27;Hara played a spoiled, wealthy American who falls in love with a brooding, tormented, about-to-retire matador (Anthony Quinn) in Mexico. Ava Gardner, who was dating a bullfighter in real life, Luis Miguel Dominguín, and Lana Turner were considered for O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s part of Karen Harrison. The film was panned by the critics. One of her best-known roles came later year, playing Lady Godiva in &quot;Lady Godiva of Coventry&quot;. Contrary to what Universal claimed to the press, O&#x27;Hara was not nude in the film, wearing a &quot;full-length body leotard and underwear that was concealed by my long tresses&quot;.
In December 1955, O&#x27;Hara negotiated a new five-picture contract with Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn, with $85,000 per picture.

The following year, she starred in the Portuguese-set melodramatic mystery film &quot;Lisbon&quot; for Republic Pictures. For the first time in her career she played a villain, and remarked that &quot;Bette Davis was right—bitches &quot;are&quot; fun to play&quot;. In the film, the first Hollywood production to be shot in Portugal, she is caught in a love triangle with Ray Milland and Claude Rains, who according to Malone both attempted to &quot;outsuave each other&quot; during the whole production. Later that year she made &quot;Everything But the Truth&quot; for Universal, at a time in her career when she was trying to distance herself from adventure films. O&#x27;Hara thought the film was so bad that neither she nor her family saw it, though she enjoyed working with John Forsythe.

In 1957, O&#x27;Hara marked the end of her collaboration with John Ford with &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot;, which was based on the true story of an old friend of Ford&#x27;s, Frank &quot;Spig&quot; Wead, a naval aviator who became a screenwriter in Hollywood. Malone wrote that &quot;Wayne and O&#x27;Hara interact well in these early scenes, giving effortless performances and exhibiting a strong chemistry. One can sense the offscreen friendship in little nuances between them&quot;. Though not a major commercial success, it fared better in the eyes of the critics. The relationship between O&#x27;Hara and Ford grew increasingly bitter, and that year he referred to her as a &quot;greedy bitch&quot; to director Joseph McBride, who had shown an interest in casting her for &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot;. O&#x27;Hara later referred to him as an &quot;instant conman&quot; who would say the opposite of what he felt and said of his bitterness: &quot;He wanted to be born in Ireland and he wanted to be an Irish rebel. The fact that he wasn&#x27;t left him very bitter&quot;.

===1959–1991: Later career===
Although O&#x27;Hara was consciously moving away from adventure films, an ongoing court case against &quot;Confidential&quot; magazine in 1957 and 1958 and an operation for a slipped disk, after which she had to wear a full body brace for four months, effectively ruled out any further action films for her. During this period away from film she took lessons in singing to improve her abilities. O&#x27;Hara had a soprano voice and described singing as her first love, which she was able to channel through television. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, she was a guest on musical variety shows with Perry Como, Andy Williams, Betty Grable and Tennessee Ernie Ford. In 1960, O&#x27;Hara starred on Broadway in the musical &quot;Christine&quot; which ran for 12 performances. It was a problematic production, and the director, Jerome Chodorov, was so displeased with it that he requested that his name be removed from the credits. She found her Broadway failure to be a &quot;major disappointment&quot; and returned to Hollywood. That year she released two recordings, &quot;Love Letters from Maureen O&#x27;Hara&quot; and &quot;Maureen O&#x27;Hara Sings her Favorite Irish Songs&quot;. She described &quot;Love Letters from Maureen O&#x27;Hara&quot;, a moderate success, as an act of revenge, given that Hollywood would not let her appear in a musical.
In 1959, O&#x27;Hara returned to film, starring as a secretary who is sent from London to Havana to assist a British secret agent (Alec Guinness) in the commercially successful &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;. O&#x27;Hara beat Lauren Bacall to the role as she was busy with other engagements. Though the film was critically acclaimed, Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that the characters of O&#x27;Hara and the daughter could have been made &quot;more humorous and spirited than they are&quot;. The following year, O&#x27;Hara appeared in the CBS television film, &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, but despite some critics approving her performance, most thought that the remake was ill-timed and that she could not top Greer Garson&#x27;s performance in the 1942 Oscar-winning film.

In 1961, O&#x27;Hara portrayed Kit Tilden in the western &quot;The Deadly Companions&quot;, Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s feature-film debut. Playing against stereotype as the strong, aggressive redhead, she plays a character who is vulnerable to rape and violence from men. The plot involves her traveling across Apache territory with an ex-Sergeant to bury her young son next to his father in the desert. Malone considered her character in the film to be &quot;radically underdeveloped&quot;. While O&#x27;Hara acknowledged that Peckinpah later &quot;reached icon status as a great director of westerns&quot;, she thought he was &quot;just awful&quot; and &quot;one of the strangest and most objectionable people I had ever worked with&quot;. Later that year she starred in &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, one of her most popular films, opposite a young Hayley Mills. Filmed just before &quot;The Deadly Companions&quot; (but released just after), she co-starred with Brian Keith in both films. O&#x27;Hara credits Mills for the success of the film, remarking that &quot;she really did bring two different girls to life in the movie&quot; and wrote that &quot;Sharon and Susan were so believable that I&#x27;d sometimes forget myself and look for the other one when Hayley and I were standing around the set&quot;. Malone notes that this was the film that she &quot;made a transition from comely maiden to trendy mother&quot;, one which received some of the best critical plaudits of her career. O&#x27;Hara was subsequently involved in a legal dispute with Walt Disney, backed by the Screen Actors Guild, over billing for the film. She never worked for Disney again.

The following year, O&#x27;Hara appeared opposite James Stewart in &quot;Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation&quot;, about a family vacation in a dilapidated house on the beach. She played Peggy, the wife of Hobbs (Stewart), a character who is very family-oriented and talkative. Though the two became friends, O&#x27;Hara confessed that she was not happy with the dynamic between her and Stewart onscreen, commenting that &quot;every scene revolves around Jimmy Stewart. I was never allowed to really play out a single scene in the picture. He was a remarkable actor, but not a generous one&quot;. With the success of &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; and &quot;Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation&quot;, O&#x27;Hara felt that her career had been given a new lease of life. She united with Henry Fonda after 20 years to appear in &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (1963), roughly based on the novel by Earl Hamner Jr. The film was shot on location in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the same place that the classic 1953 western &quot;Shane&quot; was shot. O&#x27;Hara played Olivia Spencer, the devout Christian wife of Fonda&#x27;s atheist character, who during the course of the film sings a hymn at an outdoor funeral. Though Malone considers her to have given a &quot;commendable performance&quot;, he thought she lacked chemistry with Fonda and notes that the film came at a difficult period in his life, with the breakdown of his third marriage. It was poorly received by the critics at the time, but fared well at the box office. Later in 1963 she starred with John Wayne in Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s Technicolor comedic western, &quot;McLintock!&quot;. O&#x27;Hara performed many of her own stunts in the film, including one scene where she falls backwards off a ladder into a trough.
In late 1964, O&#x27;Hara went to Italy to shoot &quot;The Battle of the Villa Fiorita&quot; (1965) with Rossano Brazzi. O&#x27;Hara played a British woman who leaves her diplomat husband in England for an Italian pianist (Brazzi). She had high expectations for the film but soon realized that Brazzi was miscast. She was so frustrated with the finished film, which was a box office flop, that she cried. O&#x27;Hara made her last picture with James Stewart the following year in the comedic western, &quot;The Rare Breed&quot;. Malone thought that she modeled her performance on Julie Andrews, &quot;adopting a schoolmarmish voice and demeanor that ill befit her&quot;, and coming out with pious statements like &quot;cleanliness is next to godliness&quot;.

In 1970, O&#x27;Hara starred opposite Jackie Gleason in &quot;How Do I Love Thee?&quot;. During filming in the summer of 1969, O&#x27;Hara was involved in an accident on set with Gleason when he tripped on a Cyclone wire fence, falling heavily on her hand which was resting on it. She later required orthopedic surgery to correct the injury. Though she got on well with Gleason, O&#x27;Hara remarked that it was a &quot;terrible film. The script was awful, and the director couldn&#x27;t fix it&quot;. The film was poorly received critically, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; calling it &quot;the most mawkish film of the year/decade/era&quot;. In October of that year she made her last film with Wayne in &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971), shot on location in Durango, Mexico. Director Budd Boetticher cast O&#x27;Hara as he believed that she and Wayne had chemistry which was &quot;head and shoulders&quot; over those of other leading actresses at the time. After &quot;Big Jake&quot;, O&#x27;Hara retired from the industry. In 1972 she professed to strongly disapprove of the way Hollywood was going, &quot;making dirty pictures&quot;, and she wanted no part of it. That year she was asked to give a speech at the Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony for John Ford, which was the last occasion she saw him before his death on 31 August 1973.

After a 20-year retirement from the film industry, O&#x27;Hara returned to the screen in 1991 to star opposite John Candy in the romantic comedy drama &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;. She played Rose Muldoon, the domineering Irish mother of a Chicago cop (Candy), who has an indifference to Sicilians. The film reunited her with Anthony Quinn who plays her brief love interest, Nick the Greek. O&#x27;Hara stated of her return: &quot;Twenty years is a long time, but it was surprising how little changed. The equipment is lighter now, and they work a bit faster, but I hardly felt like I&#x27;d been away&quot;. She described Candy as &quot;one of my all-time favorite leading men&quot;, and was surprised by the extent of his talent, remarking that he was a &quot;comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent&quot; who very much reminded her of Charles Laughton. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV films, including &quot;The Christmas Box&quot;, &quot;Cab to Canada&quot; with Catherine Bell, and &quot;The Last Dance,&quot; the latter her last film, in which she played a retired teacher who suffers a heart attack, released on television in 2000.

==Reception and character==

Malone states that as &quot;Ireland&#x27;s first Hollywood superstar&quot;, O&#x27;Hara &quot;paved the way for a future generation of actresses seeking their own voice ... With her mahogany hair, her hoydenish ways, and her whip-smart delivery of lines, she created a character prototype that seemed to define her country of origin as much as Ireland defined her&quot;. He notes though that O&#x27;Hara was &quot;loved for her naturalness&quot; and her &quot;lack of a diva quality&quot;. She dismissed method acting as &quot;tommyrot&quot;, believing that acting should be acting, and placed great emphasis on work ethic and punctuality. Insisting on doing her own stunts, O&#x27;Hara became so prone to injuries during her productions that her colleagues remarked that she &quot;should have been awarded a Purple Heart&quot;. Her closest rival in the 1950s was Rhonda Fleming, the two both being prolific in westerns and action films.
John Ford reportedly once commented in a letter that O&#x27;Hara was the finest actress in Hollywood, but he rarely praised her in person. In an interview with Bertrand Tavernier, on the other hand, Ford professed that O&#x27;Hara was one of the actresses he most detested. Though she was quite proud of her own versatility as an actress, saying &quot;I played every kind of role. I was never petite or cute so there was never anything about me which would go out of style&quot;, critics found fault with her range. Malone wrote that she &quot;seemed to struggle in comedic roles but proved her mettle in films that called on her to take charge of situations or find courage in the face of adversity&quot;. One 2013 critic asserted that it took a director like John Ford to bring out a good performance from her. The Irish critic Philip Moloy thought the opposite, saying &quot;It is not something that she would accept herself, but Maureen O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s career probably suffered from its long-term association with John Ford. John Ford&#x27;s view of Ireland, and things Irish, tended to be broad, sentimental and sociologically distorted, and his characters were often clichéd representatives of their nationality&quot;. In the 1960s, O&#x27;Hara ventured into maturer roles as she aged.

O&#x27;Hara had a reputation in Hollywood for bossiness, and John Wayne once referred to her as &quot;the greatest guy I ever met&quot;. Rick Kogan of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; quotes her in saying that she and Wayne shared many similarities, and took &quot;no nonsense from anybody&quot;.
She was friends with Zanuck and Harry Cohn, the boss of Columbia Pictures, who was notorious for being the &quot;nastiest man in Hollywood&quot;, Film executives respected the fact that she was bold and completely honest towards them. O&#x27;Hara declared that she had &quot;never had a temperamental fit in my life&quot;, but did admit to walking off the set in disgust at George Montgomery nearly choking her to death with a kiss during the filming of &quot;Ten Gentleman from West Point&quot;.

Teetotaler and non-smoker, O&#x27;Hara rejected the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career she refused to appear to smoke and drink on screen, and it was only later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O&#x27;Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that &quot;her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn&#x27;t what one expected from a sex symbol&quot;. When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O&#x27;Hara remarked: &quot;I come from a very strict family, and I can&#x27;t do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad&quot;, and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn&#x27;t be photographed in a bathing suit &quot;Because I don&#x27;t think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O&#x27;Hara later commented that &quot;I&#x27;m not prudish but my training was strict&quot;. She believed that her fastidious lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, &quot;I&#x27;m a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don&#x27;t let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary&quot; and &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn&#x27;t going to play the whore. That wasn&#x27;t me&quot;. She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, saying &quot;Producers look at a pretty face and think: &#x27;She must have got this far on her looks&#x27;. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, &#x27;She must be a great actress, she isn&#x27;t pretty&#x27;. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind&quot;. O&#x27;Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black-and-white films, because her looks were shown to great advantage in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that she was one of the few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth with which she refused to part.

==Personal life and death==

In 1939, at the age of 19, O&#x27;Hara secretly married Englishman George H. Brown, a film producer, production assistant and occasional scriptwriter whom she had met on the set of &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;. They married at St Paul&#x27;s Church in Station Road, Harrow, on 13 June, shortly before she left for Hollywood. Brown stayed behind in England to shoot a film with Paul Robeson. Brown announced that he and O&#x27;Hara had kept the marriage a secret and that they would have a full marriage ceremony in October 1939, but O&#x27;Hara never returned. The marriage was annulled in 1941. O&#x27;Hara became a naturalised American citizen on 25 January 1946.

In December 1941, O&#x27;Hara married American film director William Houston Price, who was the dialogue director in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. She lost her virginity to Price on her wedding night and immediately regretted it, recalling thinking to herself, &quot;What the hell have I done now&quot;. Soon after the honeymoon, O&#x27;Hara realized Price was alcoholic. The couple had one child, a daughter, Bronwyn Bridget FitzSimons née Price. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s marriage to Price steadily declined throughout the 1940s due to his alcohol abuse, and she often wanted to file for divorce but felt guilty due to her Catholic beliefs. Price eventually realized the marriage was over and filed for divorce in July 1951 on the grounds of &quot;incompatibility&quot;. Price left the house they shared in Bel Air, Los Angeles, on 29 December 1951, on their 10th wedding anniversary.

O&#x27;Hara always denied having any extramarital affairs, but in his autobiography, frequent collaborator Anthony Quinn claimed to have fallen in love with her on the set of &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot;. He commented that she was &quot;dazzling, and the most understanding woman on this earth&quot; who &quot;brought out the Gaelic in him&quot;, being half Irish. Quinn implied that they had been involved in an affair, adding that &quot;after a while we both tired of the deceit&quot;.

From 1953 to 1967, O&#x27;Hara had a relationship with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O&#x27;Hara stated that Parra &quot;saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him was one of the most painful things I have ever had to do.&quot; As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O&#x27;Hara. Price also continued to harass O&#x27;Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O&#x27;Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7-a-month alimony. During the publicity stage of &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot; in 1955, Ford insulted O&#x27;Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles: &quot;if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns&quot;.
On 9 July 1957, O&#x27;Hara filed a $5 million lawsuit against &quot;Confidential&quot; magazine over allegations it made over her being engaged in sexual activity with Parra during a screening of a film at the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. One of the allegations was &quot;Maureen had entered Grauman&#x27;s wearing a white silk blouse neatly buttoned. Now it wasn&#x27;t&quot;, and that when the usher shone a flashlight towards them she was forced to sit up and play innocent. O&#x27;Hara proved her innocence by presenting a passport showing that she was in Spain shooting &quot;Fire Over Africa&quot; at the time. She claimed in her autobiography that she became the first actress to win a case against an industry tabloid when &quot;Confidential&quot; were apparently found guilty of libel and conspiring to publish obscenity, but Malone notes that the trial dragged on for six weeks and the case was actually eventually settled out of court in July 1958.

O&#x27;Hara married her third husband, Charles F. Blair Jr., 11 years her senior, on 12 March 1968. Blair, an immensely popular figure, was a pioneer of transatlantic aviation, a former brigadier general of the United States Air Force, a former chief pilot at Pan Am, and founder and head of the United States Virgin Islands airline Antilles Air Boats. A few years after her marriage to Blair, O&#x27;Hara, for the most part, retired from acting. In the special features section to the DVD release of &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, a story is recounted that O&#x27;Hara retired after longtime collaborators John Wayne and John Ford teased her about being married but not being a good, stay-at-home housewife, though Blair himself wanted her to retire from acting and help run his business. Blair died in 1978 in a Grumman Goose belonging to his airline that he was piloting from Saint Croix to St. Thomas that crashed due to an engine failure and pilot error according to the NTSB. O&#x27;Hara was elected CEO and president of the airline, with the added distinction of becoming the first woman president of a scheduled airline in the United States.

In 1978, O&#x27;Hara was diagnosed with cancer of the uterus, which had to be removed with an operation. She was greatly affected by John Wayne&#x27;s cancer during this period, and Wayne reportedly wept on the phone when she informed him that her own cancer had been given the all clear. O&#x27;Hara was instrumental in Wayne being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1979, shortly before his death. She argued that &quot;John Wayne is not just an actor. John Wayne &quot;is&quot; the United States of America&quot; and personally selected the portrait of him to go on the medal. After Wayne&#x27;s death in June 1979, she fell into deep depression and took several years to recover.

In 1976, Blair had bought O&#x27;Hara a travel magazine, the &quot;Virgin Islander&quot;, which she began to edit from their home for many years in Saint Croix. She sold it in 1980 to &quot;USA Today&quot; to spend more time with her daughter and grandson Conor (born 1970). She passed on the airline business the following year, which by this time was chartering 120 flights a day with a fleet of 27 planes. O&#x27;Hara had had considerable prior experience with business as from the 1940s she ran a clothing store in Tarzana, Los Angeles, operating under her name, specializing in dresses for women. O&#x27;Hara increasingly spent time in Glengarriff on the south-west coast of Ireland, and established a golf tournament there in 1984 in the memory of her husband, Charles Blair. A hurricane in 1989 destroyed her home in Saint Croix. While in New York, inquiring about the costs of rebuilding, she suffered six successive heart attacks and underwent an angioplasty. She moved permanently to Glengariff after suffering a stroke in 2005.

In May 2012, O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s family contacted social workers regarding claims that O&#x27;Hara, who had short-term memory loss, was a victim of elder abuse. In September 2012, O&#x27;Hara flew to the United States after receiving doctor&#x27;s permission to fly, and moved in with her grandson in Idaho. In her last years she suffered from type 2 diabetes and short-term memory loss.

On 24–25 May 2013, O&#x27;Hara made a public appearance at the 2013 John Wayne Birthday &quot;Tribute to Maureen O&#x27;Hara&quot; celebration in Winterset, Iowa. The occasion was groundbreaking for the new John Wayne Birthplace Museum; the festivities included an official proclamation from Iowa Governor Terry Branstad declaring 25 May 2013, as &quot;Maureen O&#x27;Hara Day&quot; in Iowa. The appearance included a performance by the Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band, who travelled from Chicago for the event.

On 24 October 2015, O&#x27;Hara died in her sleep at her home in Boise, Idaho, from natural causes. She was 95 years old. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s remains were buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia next to her late husband Charles Blair.

As a &quot;staunch conservative Republican, O&#x27;Hara supported the presidencies elections of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush&quot;.

==Honors==

O&#x27;Hara was honored on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, which was aired on 27 March 1957. In 1982 she was the first person to receive the American Ireland Fund Lifetime Achievement Award in Los Angeles. In 1988 she was awarded an honorary degree by the National University of Ireland, Galway. She further received the Heritage Award from the Ireland-American Fund in 1991.

In 1985 she was awarded the Career Achievement Award from the American Cinema Foundation. O&#x27;Hara also became the first woman to win the John F. Kennedy Memorial Award for &quot;Outstanding American of Irish Descent for Service to God and Country&quot;. For her contributions to the motion picture industry, O&#x27;Hara has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7004 Hollywood Blvd. In 1993, she was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She was awarded the Golden Boot Award.

In March 1999, O&#x27;Hara was selected to be Grand Marshal of New York City&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade. In 2004, she was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Irish Film and Television Academy in her native Dublin. The same year, O&#x27;Hara released her autobiography &quot;″Tis Herself&quot;, co-authored with Johnny Nicoletti and published by Simon &amp; Schuster. She wrote the foreword for the cookbook &quot;At Home in Ireland&quot;, and in 2007 she penned the foreword to the biography of her friend and film co-star, the late actress Anna Lee.

O&#x27;Hara was named &quot;Irish America&quot;″s &quot;Irish American of the Year&quot; in 2005, with festivities held at the Plaza Hotel in New York. In 2006, O&#x27;Hara attended the Grand Reopening and Expansion of the Flying Boats Museum in Foynes, County Limerick as a patron of the museum. A significant portion of the museum is dedicated to her late husband Charles. O&#x27;Hara donated her late husband&#x27;s seaplane, the &quot;Excambian&quot; (a Sikorsky VS-44A), to the New England Air Museum. The restoration of the plane took eight years and time was donated by former pilots and mechanics in honor of Charles Blair. It is the only surviving example of this type of early trans-Atlantic plane.

In 2011, O&#x27;Hara was formally inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame at an event in New Ross, County Wexford. She was also named the president of the Universal Film &amp; Festival Organization (UFFO), which promotes a code of conduct for film festivals and the film industry.

In 2012, O&#x27;Hara received the Freedom of the Town of Kells, County Meath, Ireland, her father&#x27;s home, and a sculpture in her honour was unveiled.

In 2014, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences selected O&#x27;Hara to receive the academy&#x27;s Honorary Oscar, which was presented at the annual Governor&#x27;s Awards in November that year. O&#x27;Hara became only the second actress, after Myrna Loy in 1991, to receive an Honorary Oscar without having previously been nominated for an Oscar in a competitive category.

<text>Anjelica Huston ( ; born July 8, 1951) is an American actress, director and model known for often portraying eccentric and distinctive characters. She has received multiple accolades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award, as well as nominations for three British Academy Film Awards and six Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2010, she was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

The daughter of director John Huston and granddaughter of actor Walter Huston, she reluctantly made her big screen debut in her father&#x27;s &quot;A Walk with Love and Death&quot; (1969). Huston moved from London to New York City, where she worked as a model throughout the 1970s. She decided to actively pursue acting in the early 1980s, and subsequently, had her breakthrough with her performance as a mobster moll in &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; (1985), also directed by her father, for which she became the third generation of her family to receive an Academy Award, when she won Best Supporting Actress, joining both John and Walter Huston in this recognition. She achieved further critical and popular recognition for playing a mistress in &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989), a long-vanished wife in &quot;Enemies, A Love Story&quot; (1989), a con artist in &quot;The Grifters&quot; (1990), the Grand High Witch in &quot;The Witches&quot; (1990), Morticia Addams in the &quot;Addams Family&quot; films (1991–93), and an adventurous writer in &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot; (1993).

Huston directed the films &quot;Bastard Out of Carolina&quot; (1996) and &quot;Agnes Browne&quot; (1999); collaborated with director Wes Anderson in &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001), &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (2007); and lent her voice to several animated films, mainly the &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; franchise (2008–2015). Her other films include &#x27; (1995), &quot;[[Ever After]]&quot; (1998), &quot;[[Daddy Day Care]]&quot; (2003), &quot;[[Choke (2008 film)|Choke]]&quot; (2008), &quot;[[50/50 (2011 film)|50/50]]&quot; (2011) and &quot;[[John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum]]&quot; (2019). She has also acted in the miniseries &quot;[[Family Pictures]]&quot; (1993), &quot;[[Buffalo Girls (miniseries)|Buffalo Girls]]&quot; (1995), and&#x27; (2001), as well as the series &quot;Huff&quot; (2006), &quot;Medium&quot; (2008–2009), and &quot;Transparent&quot; (2015–2016). She won a Golden Globe for playing Carrie Chapman Catt in the cable film &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot; (2004), and a Gracie Award for her portrayal of Eileen Rand in &quot;Smash&quot; (2012–2013). She has written the memoirs &quot;A Story Lately Told&quot; (2013) and &quot;Watch Me&quot; (2014).

==Early life==
Huston was born on July 8, 1951, at 6:29 p.m., in the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, in Los Angeles, to director and actor John Huston and prima ballerina and model Enrica Soma. According to Huston, &quot;the news of my arrival was cabled promptly to the post office in the township of Butiaba, in Western Uganda [and two] days later, a barefoot runner bearing a telegram finally arrived at Murchison Falls&quot;, where her father was filming &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951). Huston&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Canadian-born actor Walter Huston. Huston has Scottish, Irish, English and Welsh ancestry from her father, and Italian from her mother.

When Huston was 2 years old, her family relocated to Ireland, where she spent much of her childhood and which she still considers home. Her parents rented what Huston called the &quot;Courtown House&quot; — a tall stone Victorian manor in County Kildare — for three years, before John Huston bought St. Clerans, a 110-acre estate in County Galway, in 1954. She attended school at Kylemore Abbey, and later attended Holland Park School after relocating to England.

Huston has a complex family because of her parents&#x27; multiple marriages and extramarital affairs. She has an older brother, Tony, and an adopted older brother, Pablo. She has a younger maternal half-sister named Allegra, whom she called &quot;Legs&quot;, and a younger paternal half-brother, actor Danny Huston. She is the aunt of actor Jack Huston. She once described herself as a &quot;lonely child&quot;, explaining: &quot;My brother Tony and I were never very close, neither as children nor as adults, but I was tightly bound to him. We were forced to be together because we were really quite alone. We were in the middle of the Irish countryside ... and we didn&#x27;t see many other kids. We were tutored. Our father was mostly away [for filming]&quot;.

==Career==
===Screen debut and modeling (1968–1975)===

Her father&#x27;s film &quot;A Walk with Love and Death&quot; (1969), where Huston played the 16-year-old French noblewoman Claudia opposite Assi Dayan, marked her screen debut. She had been in the running to play Juliet in director Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968), but Huston withdrew her from consideration when her father decided to cast her as Claudia in &quot;A Walk With Love and Death&quot;. Huston felt that she was wrong for the role, and has commented on the experience that her father &quot;miscast me first time out and I think he realized that. I was ready to act, but I wasn&#x27;t ready to act for him ... I was difficult, I didn&#x27;t want to act with no makeup, although I&#x27;d have done it for Franco.&quot; Father and daughter had a fractious relationship on set, with the young Anjelica having difficulty learning her lines and focusing, while her father grew more impatient and angry at directing her. Critics derided her performance.

Huston and her mother were photographed by Arnaud De Rosnay —whom she met at age 16 in Switzerland— in October 1968 for &quot;Vogue&quot;.
Shortly afterwards, her mother died in a car accident, and the young Huston relocated to New York City as she &quot;sort of fled London because of the memories; I didn&#x27;t really know what to do with myself, and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what my father&#x27;s intentions were for me —whether he was going to put me in a convent or launch me as an actress. Well, he&#x27;d already tried to do that, and we&#x27;d had a hard time on the making of that first film we did together&quot;. Inspired by models Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy, Huston decided to pursue modelling, and through photographer Richard Avedon, a friend of her parents, she met Diana Vreeland who proposed to Huston her first American &quot;Vogue&quot; photoshoot, which took place in Ireland. She described it as &quot;very innovative because they presaged the whole sort of Gypsy look&quot;.

Huston became a frequent subject of Bob Richardson, with whom she lived until 1973. She was signed to Ford Models and in the early 1970s, worked in Europe &quot;for a couple of years&quot;. She walked the runway for brands such as Zandra Rhodes, Yamamoto, Armani and Valentino. Along with Pat Cleveland, Pat Ast, Elsa Peretti, Karen Bjornson and Alva Chinn, she became one of fashion designer Halston&#x27;s favored troupe of models, nicknamed the Halstonettes.

===Transition to film and breakthrough (1976–1988)===
After breaking up with Richardson, Huston met actor Jack Nicholson and moved to California, to focus on acting. While she &quot;didn&#x27;t do much there for three years&quot;, she filmed a small role in &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; (1976), based on F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel of the same name. Bob Rafelson&#x27;s remake &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1981), based on the novel by James M. Cain, featured Huston as the fling of a Depression-era drifter, played by Nicholson. She briefly appeared in the drama &quot;Frances&quot; (1982) and the mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984) before obtaining a larger role in the science fiction film &quot;The Ice Pirates&quot; (1984).

Her father cast Huston as Maerose, the daughter of a New York Mafia clan head whose love is scorned by a hit man, in the film adaptation &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; (1985), which also starred Nicholson. She was paid the SAG-AFTRA scale rate of US$14,000 for her role. When her agent called up the movie&#x27;s producer to request if she could be paid more, she was told &quot;Go to hell. Be my guest — ask for more money. We don&#x27;t even want her in this movie.&quot; Huston, who was not only John Huston&#x27;s daughter but also Jack Nicholson&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, wrote in her 2014 memoir &quot;Watch Me&quot; that she later overheard a production worker saying: &quot;Her father is the director, her boyfriend&#x27;s the star, and she has no talent.&quot; Nevertheless, Huston garnered positive notices for her performance. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her part as a &quot;wonderful character, far darker and more complex than is indicated by her self-deprecating wisecracks (&quot;I&#x27;m a family scandal. I got a reputation to keep up&quot;). She&#x27;s a riveting presence and if Miss Huston, the daughter of the director, doesn&#x27;t get an Oscar nomination for this performance, I&#x27;ll be very surprised.&quot; Indeed, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, making her the third generation of her family to win an Oscar.

Huston starred opposite Michael Jackson in the 17-minute US$30 million 3D film &quot;Captain EO&quot;, written by George Lucas and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, which ran from 1986 at Disneyland and Epcot, and later at Tokyo Disneyland and Euro Disneyland. Coppola next cast her as the girlfriend of an army platoon sergeant in &quot;Gardens of Stone&quot; (1987), a film that dealt with the effect of the Vietnam War on the United States homefront. Film critic Roger Ebert praised her onscreen chemistry with co-star James Caan, remarking that &quot;the romance between Caan and Huston is one of the great adult love stories in recent movies&quot;.

Huston starred in her father&#x27;s last film, 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Dead&quot;, as the wife of an academic. According to her, her father remained a filmmaking virtuoso despite his ill health: &quot;He was so sick, but he could literally do it with his eyes closed. He knew when we were going to get a take way long before the camera rolled. I mean the timing was so precise that he could tell everything, exactly how it was going to go.&quot; The pressures of filming and watching her father&#x27;s health deteriorate had an adverse effect on Anjelica Huston&#x27;s own health, developing Epstein-Barr syndrome during production. John died nearly four months before the film&#x27;s release date, upon which it received two nominations at the 60th Academy Awards. For her performance, she won as Best Supporting Female at the 3rd Independent Spirit Awards.

In 1988, Huston played the love interest of an engaging, multi-talented, middle-class Yale University graduate in &quot;Mr. North&quot;, which was more of a family project, directed by half-brother Danny Huston, and made a cameo appearance in the film adaptation &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot;. Despite her limited screen time, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her portrayal in the latter as the &quot;single most stunning performance&quot; but called the film &quot;both too literal and devoid of real point.&quot;

===Critical and popular recognition (1989–1995)===
Huston earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of a flight attendant having an affair with a respected family guy in Woody Allen&#x27;s dramedy &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989). The drama &quot;Enemies, A Love Story&quot;, also released in 1989, featured her as the long-vanished wife of a Holocaust survivor. In a positive review for the film, Roger Ebert asserted: &quot;Parts, especially the scenes with Huston, are heartwarming in a strange way, because they show one human being accepting the weaknesses of another&quot;. For her role, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

In &quot;The Witches&quot; (1990), based on the 1983 book of the same name by Roald Dahl, Huston starred as the Grand High Witch, the all-powerful leader of the world&#x27;s witches. She and the costume designer Marit Allen originally brought a different dress for the role, but the director Nicolas Roeg rejected it as &quot;not sexy&quot;. Huston recalled: &quot;That was the first time I&#x27;d imagined that this horrible creature in a children&#x27;s movie should have sex appeal. It simply had not occurred to me. But of course, Nic was absolutely right. His vision was diabolical and dark and brilliantly funny. If a witch was to be at the center of this plot, she needed to be sexy to hold the eye.&quot; The character&#x27;s monstrous version was prepared by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop and &quot;took over six hours to apply and almost as much time to remove at the end of the day.&quot; Despite a lackluster box office response, the film was applauded by critics and has obtained a cult following over the years; it has also remained one of Huston&#x27;s favorite roles.

Huston next portrayed a veteran con artist in the neo-noir thriller &quot;The Grifters&quot; (also 1990). Director Stephen Frears first contacted her about playing Lilly in 1989 while she was filming &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, but after reading the script, she was unsure. Although she was &quot;transfixed&quot; by the story and the character, the script alarmed her with its explicitness. A few months later, Frears contacted Huston again to see if she was still interested. Still wavering, Huston&#x27;s talent agent Sue Mengers told her bluntly &quot;Anjelica, if Stephen Frears tells you he wants you to shit in the corner, then that&#x27;s what you must do.&quot; The next day Huston auditioned for the role in front of Frears at the Chateau Marmont. Frears&#x27; initial reluctance to cast Huston because she looked too much like &quot;a lady&quot;, was resolved with the decision to cheapen her look with a bleached blond wig and &quot;vulgar clothes&quot;. To research her part, she studied women dealers at card parlors in Los Angeles County, California. Her performance earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Huston obtained the part of Morticia Addams, the stern, aloof matriarch of the titular family, in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991). She based aspects of her performance on her friend Jerry Hall to give the character more warmth, and in her 2014 memoir &quot;Watch Me&quot;, she described the filming as &quot;long and arduous&quot;. It was decided that the character of Morticia should have eyes which slanted upwards at the sides, an effect which was achieved by attaching an elastic strap to the back of Huston&#x27;s head via fabric tabs glued at her temples, which pulled the corners of her eyes upwards. The bands caused extended discomfort to Huston, and would snap at the slightest turn of Huston&#x27;s head, causing a grueling repair time. Eventually, she learned to pivot and turn on her feet without moving her upper body or head. &quot;The Addams Family&quot; was a commercial success, grossing over US$191 million worldwide, and prompted a sequel, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993). For both installments, Huston garnered Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

Following a small role in the satire &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), Huston reunited with Woody Allen on &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot;, in which she played the friend of a married couple investigating the death of their neighbor&#x27;s wife, and also portrayed a mother struggling to parent her autistic child, in the ABC miniseries &quot;Family Pictures&quot;. She received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot;, and a nomination for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film at the 51st Golden Globe Awards for &quot;Family Pictures&quot;. In 1995, Huston portrayed a Cuban refuge attempting to stay in America in the comedy &#x27; and the former wife of a tormented man (played by Jack Nicholson) in Sean Penn&#x27;s sophomore directorial effort, the drama &#x27;. Her performance in the latter was praised, and she received nominations for Best Supporting Actress from the Hollywood Foreign Press and the Screen Actors Guild. Based on the 1990 novel of the same name, the CBS miniseries &quot;Buffalo Girls&quot; —in which she starred as frontierswoman Calamity Jane, opposite Melanie Griffith and Reba McEntire— earned Huston an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie.

===Directing (1996–2000)===
After contemplating the idea of following in her father&#x27;s footsteps, Huston started to put out &quot;discreet feelers&quot; and pursue material in Hollywood she felt attracted to direct. The studios&#x27; overall response was &quot;swift and positive, with the usual blinders&quot;, according to Huston. &quot;What they offered me had invariably something to do with my father. I didn&#x27;t want to do a sequel to &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;. &quot;Prizzi&quot; belongs to him. I wanted to do something that, succeed or fail, would be my own.&quot; She found it in the drama &quot;Bastard Out of Carolina&quot;, based on a novel by Dorothy Allison, about an impoverished girl who endures physical and sexual abuse. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, and debuted as a television film on Showtime. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries or a Special.

In &quot;Ever After: A Cinderella Story&quot; (1998), a modern, post-feminist interpretation of the Cinderella story alongside Drew Barrymore and Melanie Lynskey, Huston appeared as Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent, the new wife of Auguste de Barbarac, a wealthy widower. The film was acclaimed by critics and made a respectable US$98 million globally. Lisa Schwarzbaum from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised her performance as a cruel stepmother: &quot;Huston does a lot of eye narrowing and eyebrow raising while toddling around in an extraordinary selection of extreme headgear, accompanied by her two less-than-self-actualized daughters—the snooty, social-climbing, nasty Marguerite, and the dim, lumpy, secretly nice Jacqueline. &quot;Nothing is final until you&#x27;re dead&quot;, Mama instructs her girls at the dinner table, &quot;and even then I&#x27;m sure God negotiates.&quot;
In 1998, Huston played a woman romantically involved with a compulsive gambler in the neo-noir &quot;Phoenix&quot;, with Ray Liotta, as well as the mother of a troubled man in Vincent Gallo&#x27;s independent dramedy &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot;, which starred Gallo as her son and reunited her with Christina Ricci. The director had difficulties working with his cast and crew, and reportedly did not get along with Huston on set. He claimed she caused the film to be turned down by the Cannes Film Festival.

Her next directorial effort, the Irish dramedy &quot;Agnes Browne&quot; (1999) —in which she also starred as the title character— was released to mixed reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Stephen Holden found it &quot;nothing more than a series of homey skits loosely woven into a portrait of a working-class saint.&quot; Nevertheless, the film won the Youth Jury Award at the 1999 San Sebastián International Film Festival and received a Grand Prix nomination at the Ghent International Film Festival the same year. Huston appeared as an affluent English woman, alongside James Fox, Nick Nolte, Kate Beckinsale, and Uma Thurman, in James Ivory&#x27;s period drama &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (2000), based on the 1904 novel of the same name by Henry James.

===Films with Wes Anderson (2001–2007)===
In &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001), her first collaboration with director Wes Anderson, Huston took on the role the soft-spoken matriarch of an estranged family of former child prodigies, alongside Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson. During production, Anderson gave Huston photographs of his mother who, like Etheline, was an archaeologist. Huston said, &quot;Wes would send pictures of his mother in aviator jackets or on archaeological digs, and he very specifically wanted me to wear a certain locket. Finally, I asked him, &#x27;Wes, am I playing your mother?&#x27;&quot; Anderson replied this was not the case. Anderson and Huston had a tense relationship with Hackman, who was not always amiable on set. On the first day Hackman and Huston appeared in a scene together, Huston had to slap him, and later said the slap was real and &quot;I hit him a really good one. I saw the imprint of my hand on his cheek and I thought, he&#x27;s going to kill me.&quot; During young Margot&#x27;s birthday scene in the opening scenes, Huston&#x27;s hair caught fire from a birthday candle. Anderson credited Kumar Pallana with extinguishing the blaze before Huston was seriously injured. A positive critical response greeted &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, which made US$71.4 million worldwide.

In 2001, Huston starred as Viviane, Lady of the Lake, in the TNT miniseries &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, based on the 1983 novel of the same title by Marion Zimmer Bradley. The production was watched by more than 30 million &quot;unduplicated viewers&quot; during its premiere, making it the highest-rated original movie of the summer on basic cable, and earned Huston nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 2002, she portrayed the doctor of an ex-FBI agent (Clint Eastwood) chasing a sadistic killer (Jeff Daniels) in the thriller &quot;Blood Work&quot;, loosely based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Michael Connelly, as well as the longtime client of a man who runs an exclusive escort service in George Hickenlooper&#x27;s black comedy &quot;The Man from Elysian Fields&quot;, with Andy Garcia and Mick Jagger. Despite both films&#x27; lukewarm critical and commercial responses, Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; felt that her character in &quot;Elysian Fields&quot; was &quot;played with invigorating relish&quot; by the actress, while Roger Ebert hailed the film as &quot;one of the best films&quot; of the year.

&quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; (2003), co-starring Eddie Murphy, featured Huston as the ruthless head of an expensive and over-academic preschool. &quot;Slant&quot;, in a critical review of the film, noted that Huston &quot;brings embarrassing conviction to the role of stuffy day care proprietress ... &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; seems to exist solely to sedate a theater-going public&#x27;s offspring. And while the film&#x27;s sense of sobriety should do the job, don&#x27;t expect &quot;The Witches&quot;&quot;. Nevertheless, the release was a commercial success, grossing over US$160 million worldwide.

In 2004, Huston took on the role of women&#x27;s suffrage leader Carrie Chapman Catt in the HBO film &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot;, with Hilary Swank, Frances O&#x27;Connor and Julia Ormond. For her role, she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie, and won the Golden Globe and the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. In &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004), her second film with Wes Anderson, Huston portrayed the estranged wife of an eccentric oceanographer. Roger Ebert observed that the actress &quot;seems privately amused, which is so much more intriguing than seeming publicly amused&quot;, but noted that he &quot;can&#x27;t recommend [the film], but I would not for one second discourage you from seeing it&quot;. As a member of the cast, she garnered nominations for Best Ensemble from the Boston Society of Film Critics and the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards.

Huston filmed her third directorial effort, the Hallmark Channel drama &quot;Riding the Bus with My Sister&quot; (2005), in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It was adapted from the 2002 memoir by Rachel Simon, and starred Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and Andie MacDowell. Unlike the book, the film received negative reviews from critics, who generally criticised the film&#x27;s &quot;egregious&quot; portrayal of Down&#x27;s Syndrome. However, she said: &quot;I think the movie comes from a pretty direct point of view&quot;.

In 2006, Huston was featured as an art teacher in the dramedy &quot;Art School Confidential&quot;, the president of the United States in the made-for-CBS thriller &quot;Covert One: The Hades Factor&quot;, a competing business owner in the comedy &quot;Material Girls&quot;, a vanishing con artist in the revisionist Western &quot;Seraphim Falls&quot;, and an ebullient patroness in the romantic drama &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;. Excluding &quot;Seraphim Falls&quot;, none of the aforementioned films performed well with critics nor audiences. This changed with her third Wes Anderson film, &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (2007), in which Huston starred as the mother of three brothers who becomes a nun and moves to a Christian convent in the Himalayas. Peter Travers, for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found her to be a &quot;dynamite&quot; in the film, which he deemed &quot;the fullest blossoming yet of Anderson&#x27;s talents as a total filmmaker&quot;.

===Voice-over and television roles (2008–2016)===
&quot;Choke&quot; (2008), a black comedy directed by Clark Gregg and based on the 2001 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, featured Huston as the hospitalized mother of a sex addict in Colonial America. Reviews for the film were mixed, but &quot;Empire&quot; critic Philip Wilding wrote: &quot;Huston is magnetic as [the] ailing mother Ida, both as a fading invalid or vibrant and deranged in flashback. She is the hook on which her son hangs his hopes and anxieties&quot;. Meanwhile, Roger Ebert felt that her role &quot;resembled the criminal character&quot; she played in &quot;The Grifters&quot; (1990). In 2008, Huston also voiced Queen Clarion in &quot;Tinker Bell&quot;, which was released on DVD to outstanding commercial results. She reprised the role in four sequels, a television special and a short film, all released between 2009 and 2015. 

Huston took on significant roles in three 2011 live-action films. The first was that of Miss Battle-Axe, a strict, sadistic schoolteacher who talks with a Scottish accent, in the 3D children&#x27;s musical adventure comedy &quot;Horrid Henry: The Movie&quot;, directed by Nick Moore. She found her character to be &quot;irresistible&quot;, explaining to &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s very British material to me, and I&#x27;ve always been strangely attracted to these extreme characters&quot;. The film was panned by critics but was a commercial success in the UK. Her second performance of 2011 was that of a mother of a man with a malignant cancerous tumor in the drama &quot;50/50&quot;, directed by Jonathan Levine and co-starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen. The film was a critical and commercial darling upon its release. David Schmader, writing in the &quot;Stranger&quot;, praised the &quot;stellar&quot; cast and felt that Huston &quot;roars back to prominence with a twisty performance as Adam&#x27;s barely contained mess of a mom&quot;. The unsuccessful &quot;The Big Year&quot;, Huston&#x27;s last live-action film of 2011, featured her as an &quot;avid birder&quot;, who &quot;captains ocean-going expeditions&quot;.

Huston starred in the NBC television series &quot;Smash&quot; (2012–2013), as Broadway producer Eileen Rand. After her husband&#x27;s death in 2008, Huston credited &quot;Smash&quot; —her first regular venture into series television— with coming at a &quot;vital time&quot; and finally filling a void in her life. The series aired for two seasons and was the subject of critical acclaim. Huston subsequently appeared in the second and third seasons of the Amazon Video series &quot;Transparent&quot;, as Vic, a cisgender woman who forms a connection with Maura, a retired college professor of political science at UCLA. In the horror comedy &quot;The Cleanse&quot; (2016), Huston played the director of a secretive self-help program, alongside Johnny Galecki, Anna Friel and Oliver Platt.

===Recent works (2017–present)===
In 2017, Huston narrated the black comedy &quot;Thirst Street&quot;, and starred with Bill Pullman as siblings feuding over possession of their father&#x27;s estate in the comedy &quot;Trouble&quot;. John DeFore of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised the latter film, on which Huston was an executive producer, writing that &quot;the cast goes a long way here, turning &quot;Trouble&quot; at times into the kind of small-town hangout film that will please fest auds.&quot; Huston played the Director, a heavily bejeweled Russian ballet instructor, and what &quot;Vulture&quot; described as a &quot;small but memorable role&quot;, in &quot;John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum&quot; (2019), which made US$326 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics.

On June 5, 2024, it was announced that Huston had been cast as the lead in the upcoming BBC Agatha Christie limited series, &quot;Towards Zero&quot;. On September 6, 2024, it was announced that Huston was cast in the lead of the live-action/hybrid feature &quot;The Christmas Witch Trial of La Befana&quot;.
Huston is set to star alongside her brother, Danny Huston, in this film inspired by Italian folklore.

==Personal life==
Huston was a close friend of actor Gregory Peck, whom her father directed in &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956). The two first met on the set of the film when she was four years old while Peck was in costume as Captain Ahab. Decades later, after her father&#x27;s death, Huston reunited with Peck and maintained a friendship that lasted until his death.

Huston was an inadvertent witness in the Roman Polanski sexual abuse case in March 1977, when she encountered Polanski and his 13-year-old victim by chance in the home of her boyfriend Jack Nicholson. When authorities searched the house in connection to the accusations against Polanski, Huston was arrested for cocaine possession, but she was never charged because the search and seizure of her handbag had been illegal. Although she had witnessed no abuse, Huston was subsequently embroiled in the publicity surrounding Polanski&#x27;s trial as a rumored witness for the prosecution, though she was not ultimately called.

===Relationships===
In 1969, at age 17, Huston began dating photographer Bob Richardson, then 41; they lived together from that year until March 1973. A month later, she met Jack Nicholson at his 36th birthday party, and the pair started an on-again, off-again relationship that lasted until 1990, when the media reported he had fathered a child with Rebecca Broussard. During a break from Nicholson in the late 1970s, Huston was involved with Ryan O&#x27;Neal, who allegedly assaulted her.

On May 23, 1992, Huston married sculptor Robert Graham, following a courtship of almost two years. The couple lived in a three-story house, designed by Graham in Venice, California, until his death on December 27, 2008. She does not have any children, and stated in a Lifetime &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot; that she&#x27;s tried to have a baby on several occasions.

In her memoirs, Huston confirmed romances with James Fox, David Bailey and Prince Albert of Monaco. She also acknowledged an affair during the shooting of &quot;Ever After: A Cinderella Story&quot; (1998), with a married man known simply as Dolyn in the book.

In a 2013 interview with Larry King, Huston said she did not have a lover and was not looking for one.

===Activism===
Huston led a letter campaign organized by the U.S. Campaign for Burma and Human Rights Action Center in November 2007. The letter, signed by over twenty five high-profile individuals from the entertainment business, was addressed to the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and urged him to &quot;personally intervene&quot; to secure the release of Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma. Huston currently sits on the advisory council of Save the Chimps, the largest chimpanzee sanctuary and rescue in history. Huston has narrated the educational video Save the Chimps History exposing the cruelty of chimpanzee abuse by laboratories, entertainment and the NASA program Monkeys and apes in space, which sent primates into space often resulting in death by impact and explosion.

In 1995, Huston donated $500 to the Irish republican political party Sinn Féin. She has also attended Sinn Féin events and supported Martin McGuinness in his bid for the Presidency of Ireland in 2011.

In December 2012, Huston recorded a public service announcement for PETA urging her colleagues in Hollywood to refrain from using great apes in television, films, and advertisements. The animal rights organization subsequently named her their &quot;Person of the Year 2012&quot;. In 2018, she donated her fur coats to the homeless and animal shelters. She was the executive producer for &quot;Breaking the Chain&quot;, a 2020 documentary about the PETA fieldworkers who try to help neglected animals.

In August 2024, Houston wrote an open letter to Evelyn Welch, vice chancellor of the University of Bristol, calling on Welch to end &quot;forced swim tests&quot; on rats and mice in labs at the university&#x27;s research departments.

<text>&#x27; (; previously &#x27; ) is a public research university affiliated with the in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The school offers graduate and postgraduate training, and is very active in research. Following tradition, new Bachelors of Engineering (B.Eng) graduating from receive an Iron Ring, during the Canadian Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer ceremony.

==History==
 was founded in 1873 in order to teach technical drawing and other useful arts. At first, it was set in a converted residence. It later moved to a larger building on Saint-Denis street. In 1958, it moved to its current location on the campus. The original building was enlarged in 1975 and then in 1989. In 2002, the Computer and Electrical Engineering Department (they were later separated) began to occupy the fifth and sixth floor of the old École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Montréal building. In 2003, the construction of three new buildings started.

Until the 1960s, the main purpose of the school was to train engineers. However, from 1959 on, the focus went to research. Nowadays, it is a leading research institution in applied sciences in Canada.

In 1976, a SLOWPOKE-2 reactor was installed at . The operating licence for the non-power reactor was renewed June 23, 2023, and is valid until June 30, 2033. The reactor has been in operation since 1976 and is not expected to operate beyond 2040. It is used for research, teaching, neutron generation and isotope production.

===1989 massacre===
On December 6, 1989, 25-year-old Canadian Marc Lépine entered the campus of and fatally shot 14 women, wounding 10 other women and four men before killing himself on campus. For more than 30 years, the massacre was the deadliest shooting incident in modern Canadian history, until April 2020, when a gunman slew 22 people in the Nova Scotia rampage.

The Polytechnique massacre is commemorated by the Canadian government as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women.

==Campus==

The school&#x27;s campus is located on the northern face of Mount Royal. Its main building is the highest building on the main campus of the . The J.-Armand-Bombardier building sits beside the main building and mainly serves for research activities and as an emergence centre for spin-off companies, designed to support the pre-startup of technology-based businesses. The building is named for Joseph-Armand Bombardier, the inventor of the snowmobile.

The Pierre-Lassonde et Claudette MacKay-Lassonde building, home to the Electrical Engineering Department and Computer and Software Engineering Department, was inaugurated in September 2005. This new building won an &quot;Award of Merit&quot; from &quot;Canadian Architect&quot; magazine in 2003, received a Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council and scored 46 on the LEED points scale which was, at inauguration, the highest score ever obtained in Canada. The energy performance of the Lassonde buildings is 60% better than the standard set by the Model National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings.

==Organization==

<doc id="235315" wikidata="Q808962" url="?curid=235315" title="Barro Colorado Island">
<text>Barro Colorado Island is located in the man-made Gatun Lake in the middle of the Panama Canal. The island was formed when the waters of the Chagres River were dammed to form the lake in 1913. When the waters rose, they covered a significant part of the existing tropical forest, but certain hilltops remained as islands in the middle of the lake. It has an area of .

==History==
The island was set aside as a nature reserve on April 17, 1923, by the U.S. Government. Initially administered by the Panama Canal Company under the direction of James Zetek, since 1946 Barro Colorado Island has been administered by the Smithsonian, together with five adjacent peninsulas, as the Barro Colorado Nature Monument. This Monument has an area of . It is among the most-studied areas of tropical forest in the world. The Nature Monument has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) has a permanent research center on the island, dedicated to studying tropical forest ecosystems. Because the Island&#x27;s diverse ecosystem has been very little altered by humans, Barro Colorado has been studied for over eighty years within a great variety of biological disciplines. Only the larger fauna disappeared from Barro Colorado after the lake was flooded in 1914. Many scientific studies have been conducted to document the changes in the species composition of the island. Hundreds of scientists conduct research projects on Barro Colorado Island every year.

In 1978, Thomas Croat published his &quot;Flora of Barro Colorado Island&quot; documenting the plant species on the island. In 1999, Egbert Giles Leigh, who first visited the island in 1966, and now spends half his week there, published &quot;Tropical Forest Ecology : A View from Barro Colorado Island&quot;. In 2002 &quot;The Tapir&#x27;s Morning Bath&quot; by Elizabeth Royte was published, chronicling the lives and work of scientists working on the island.

National Geographic produced a documentary featuring the Barro Colorado Island titled &quot;World&#x27;s Last Great Places: Rain Forests&quot; released in 2007. The first selection, titled &quot;Panama Wild: Rain Forest of Life&quot; features scientists from the Smithsonian&#x27;s Tropical Research Institute and also highlights the battles for survival and partnerships among species within this rich ecosystem.

==Forest dynamics plot==
In 1980, a forest dynamics plot was established on Barro Colorado Island by researchers from STRI and Princeton University. The first census was conducted in 1982 and recorded every free-standing tree and shrub in the plot of more than 1 cm dbh, totalling approximately 240,000 stems of 303 different species. It has been recensused every five years since 1985, allowing scientists to study the normal dynamics of the forest, as well as extreme events, such as El Niño. Another 50-ha plot was later established in the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia in 1987, allowing the dynamics of two distinct tropical forests to be compared.

==Visiting==
Visitors are allowed on Barro Colorado Island. Access is, however, regulated by STRI. To visit the island, people must make a reservation with the staff and arrange for a tour. Tours generally include transportation to and from the island (often by boat from Gamboa), a 2–3 hour guided hike, lunch, and a visit to the museum. Hikes through the island offer the opportunity to spot several animals including monkeys, anteaters, birds and insects.

==National Emergency==
U.S. federal law states that the natural features of the island shall &quot;be left in their natural state for scientific observation and investigation&quot;, &quot;except in event of declared national emergency.&quot;

U.S. federal law no longer applies, as the Panama Canal Zone was incorporated back into Panama in 1979.

==Personal life==
Shaw is a lesbian, although she had been in two long-term relationships with men before realising her sexual orientation, stating &quot;It was a shock. I was full of self-hatred and thought I would come back into the fold shortly. But I just didn&#x27;t.&quot;

From 2002 to 2005, Shaw was the partner of English actress Saffron Burrows. She met Sri Lankan economist Sonali Deraniyagala after reading Deraniyagala&#x27;s memoir, and they married in 2018.

<doc id="235321" wikidata="Q1170417" url="?curid=235321" title="Rick Nielsen">
<text>Richard Alan Nielsen (born December 22, 1948) is an American musician best known as the lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and leader of the rock band Cheap Trick. He is well-known for his numerous custom-made guitars from Hamer Guitars, including his famous five-neck guitar.

==Career==
Nielsen was born into a musical family, with both parents being opera singers. His father, Ralph Nielsen, also directed symphonies, choirs and recorded over forty solo albums. During Rick&#x27;s teens, the family owned a music store in Rockford, Illinois, and he learned to play a number of instruments. After playing drums for six years, Rick changed direction, learning how to play guitar and keyboards.

His first school band was The Phaetons, which mutated into The Grim Reapers (which later included Tom Petersson in its line up). The Grim Reapers became Fuse which released one poorly received studio album before disbanding in 1970. Nielsen joined Nazz for a short time (replacing Todd Rundgren) before forming the short-lived Sick Man of Europe in Philadelphia in 1972 with Tom Petersson, and drummer Bun E. Carlos joining soon after. In 1973, Nielsen, together with Carlos, formed Cheap Trick. Petersson joined later that year, and Robin Zander joined in the fall of 1974. Nielsen wrote almost all of the songs for Cheap Trick&#x27;s first few albums.

Nielsen has enjoyed many highlights with Cheap Trick, including having a #1 US single, &quot;The Flame.&quot; Nielsen and Carlos were invited to record a session on August 12, 1980, with John Lennon for his upcoming &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; album. Their contributions did not appear on the released album, only becoming officially available in 1998.

==Appearance==
Nielsen&#x27;s on-stage appearance is influenced by Huntz Hall of The Bowery Boys; he wears a flipped up old style ball cap, his face resembles Hall&#x27;s, and some of Nielsen&#x27;s on-stage antics have been compared to Hall&#x27;s. Nielsen is also well known for wearing a bowtie.

Nielsen&#x27;s image moved away from the cartoonish look of the ‘70s in the mid 1990s, when he sported a mustache, goatee beard (often with a long braid) and dark glasses which gave him a mildly sinister look. That image changed again on March 9, 2001, when he shaved the beard and mustache off during the encore break at a show at hometown Rockford&#x27;s Coronado Theater. Since then, Nielsen has retained the clean shaven look, together with designer suits. In the late 2000s, he started wearing bowties again on stage.

==TV and movie appearances and radio broadcasts==
Nielsen has made countless TV appearances and radio broadcasts over the years with Cheap Trick, on music shows around the world, as well as American late night shows with Conan O&#x27;Brien, Jay Leno and David Letterman.

Outside of Cheap Trick, Nielsen&#x27;s credits include appearing as a hijacked car driver in the 1987 movie &quot;Disorderlies&quot;. He and his wife appeared on HGTV&#x27;s &quot;Homes of Note&quot; in the early 1990s. In 1997, he appeared in Michael Moore&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Big One&quot;. Nielsen appeared on an episode of The History Channel&#x27;s show &quot;American Pickers&quot; Season 8, Episode 9, that originally aired on March 11, 2013. The show followed the standard format with the show&#x27;s two stars, Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz, picking Nielsen&#x27;s various storage units full of items he has acquired through his years on tour.

On April 6, 2013 Nielsen appeared on an episode of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; show as a guest on the segment called &quot;Not My Job&quot;.

In 2013, Nielsen appeared in Dave Grohl&#x27;s documentary &quot;Sound City&quot;. In 2014, he appeared on the first episode of &quot;Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways&quot;, which focused on the city of Chicago. On October 17, 2014, Nielsen appeared on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, playing with the Foo Fighters.

In 2016, Nielsen made an appearance on the 75th episode of &quot;Live from Daryl&#x27;s House&quot; with Robin Zander, and Tom Petersson. The episode aired May 5 on MTV Live and May 15 on LFDH.com.

==Work with other artists==

Rick has guested on albums by artists such as Glen Campbell, Buck Satan and the 666 Shooters, The Yardbirds, John Lennon, Hall &amp; Oates (&#x27;Alley Katz&#x27; from the &quot;Along the Red Ledge&quot; LP), Mötley Crüe, Foo Fighters, Dusty Springfield, Miles Nielsen &amp; the Rusted Hearts, Alice Cooper, Gene Simmons, Material Issue, House of Lords, Hanson and others, while Nielsen-written songs have been recorded by artists such as Rick Derringer, and House of Lords.

==Other==
Rick displayed 34 of his guitars at a free exhibition &quot;Customised Culture – Cars, Guitars, and Lowbrow Art&quot; at the Rockford Art Museum, in Rockford, Illinois in February and April 2002.

On April 23, 2012, Nielsen and the Board of the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford unveiled plans for &quot;Rick&#x27;s Picks: A Lifelong Affair with Guitars and Music”, an ambitious exhibit displaying Nielsen&#x27;s passions for guitars, music and rock &amp; roll. The exhibit ran from August 11, 2012 to April 14, 2013, attracting people from all over the world. Visitors were able to see a huge collection of Nielsen&#x27;s guitars, personal items, stage clothing and Cheap Trick memorabilia, and listen to rare audio material.

Nielsen involves himself widely in the local community in hometown Rockford, for example, being involved with the Rockford Icehogs charitable foundation. In addition, he was a major supporter of the renovation of the Coronado Theater, and one balcony seat is covered in black and white checkerboard in his honour.

Nielsen is co-owner of Chicago&#x27;s Piece brewery and gourmet pizzeria.

Artist Shannon MacDonald has been creating paintings and guitars for Rick Nielsen since 1979.

Rick Nielsen is a celebrity co-owner of ROCK&#x27;N Vodka. ROCK&#x27;N Vodka also partnered with Rick Nielson, Josh Bilicki and Insurance King at the Daytona International Speedway on August 15, 2020 where Bilicki drove the Insurance King and ROCK&#x27;N Vodka car during the Daytona Road Course and placed 12th.

<text>Michael John Douglas (born September 5, 1951), known professionally as Michael Keaton, is an American actor. He has received numerous accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award. In 2016, he was named Officer of Order of Arts and Letters in France.

Keaton gained early recognition for his comedic roles in &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984), &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Dream Team&quot; (1989). He gained wider stardom portraying the titular superhero in &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992). Other notable roles include &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1982), &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; (1983), &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990), &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993), &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; (1997), &quot;Jack Frost&quot; (1998), &quot;RoboCop&quot; (2014), and &quot;Dumbo&quot; (2019). He also performed voice roles in the animated films &quot;Cars&quot; (2006), &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), and &quot;Minions&quot; (2015).

Keaton experienced a career resurgence after taking a starring role as a faded actor attempting a comeback in Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s &quot;Birdman&quot; (2014), for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He has since acted in biographical dramas such as &quot;Spotlight&quot; (2015), &quot;The Founder&quot; (2016), &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot; (2020), and &quot;Worth&quot; (2021). He portrayed in &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), while also reprising his roles as Batman in &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023) and the title role in &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; (2024).

Keaton starred as a journalist in the HBO film &quot;Live from Baghdad&quot; (2002). He portrayed a drug-addicted doctor in the Hulu limited series &quot;Dopesick&quot; (2021), for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Keaton directed the films &quot;The Merry Gentleman&quot; (2008) and &quot;Knox Goes Away&quot; (2023), in which he also played the starring role.

==Early life==
Michael John Douglas, the youngest of seven children, was born at Ohio Valley Hospital in Kennedy Township, Pennsylvania, on September 5, 1951. He was raised between McKees Rocks, Coraopolis and Robinson Township, Pennsylvania. His father, George A. Douglas (1905–1977), worked as a civil engineer and surveyor, and his mother, Leona Elizabeth (née Loftus; 1909–2002), was a homemaker, and came from McKees Rocks. Keaton was raised in a Catholic family. He said he liked going to Catholic school and being an altar boy, and the school shaped who he was. His mother was of Irish descent, while his father was of Scottish, Scotch-Irish, German and English ancestry, and was originally from a Protestant family. Keaton attended Montour High School in Robinson Township, Pennsylvania. He graduated with the class of 1969, and studied speech for two years at Kent State University, where he appeared in plays, and returned to Pennsylvania to pursue his career.

==Career==
===1975–1988: Early career and breakthrough===
Keaton first appeared on TV in the Pittsburgh public television programs &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; and &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; (1975). For&quot; Mister Rogers&quot; he played one of the &quot;Flying Zucchini Brothers&quot; and served as a full-time production assistant. (In 2003, after Fred Rogers&#x27; death, Keaton hosted a PBS memorial tribute, &quot;Fred Rogers: America&#x27;s Favorite Neighbor&quot;; in 2018, he hosted a 50th anniversary special of the series for PBS, &quot;Mister Rogers: It&#x27;s You I Like&quot;.) Keaton also worked as an actor in Pittsburgh theatre; he played the role of Rick in the Pittsburgh premiere of David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Sticks and Bones&quot; with the Pittsburgh Poor Players. He also performed stand-up comedy during his early years to supplement his income.

Keaton left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for various TV parts. He popped up in various popular TV shows including &quot;Maude&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Hour&quot;. He decided to use a stage name to satisfy SAG rules, as there were already an actor (Michael Douglas) and daytime host (Mike Douglas) with the same or similar names. In response to questions as to whether he selected his new surname due to an attraction to actress Diane Keaton, or in homage to silent film actor Buster Keaton, he has responded by saying &quot;it had nothing to do with that&quot;. Keaton has said in several interviews that he searched a phone book under &quot;K&quot;, saw &quot;Keaton&quot; and decided to stop looking. Keaton&#x27;s film debut came in a small non-speaking role in the Joan Rivers film &quot;Rabbit Test&quot; (1978).

His next big break was working alongside Jim Belushi in the short-lived comedy series &quot;Working Stiffs&quot;, which showcased his comedic talent and led to a co-starring role in the comedy &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1982) directed by Ron Howard. This was his breakout role as the fast-talking schemer Bill &quot;Billy Blaze&quot; Blazejowski and earned Keaton some critical acclaim.

&quot;Night Shift&quot; led to Keaton becoming a leading man in the 1983 comedy hit &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;. Keaton was pigeonholed as a comic lead during this time with films like &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984), &quot;Gung Ho&quot; (1986), &quot;The Squeeze&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Dream Team&quot; (1989), though Keaton tried to transition to dramatic leads as early as 1984, playing a hockey player in &quot;Touch and Go&quot;, which was shelved until 1986. Woody Allen cast Keaton as the lead in &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; the following year, but after filming began Allen felt Keaton was &quot;too modern&quot; and reshot his scenes with Jeff Daniels in the final film, further delaying his transition to drama in the public eye. When &quot;Touch and Go&quot; was finally released in 1986 the studio was still unsure of how to market the film, making the poster, trailer and TV spots similar to &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;, which resulted in the film not finding its target audience.

1988 was a seminal year in Keaton&#x27;s career, in which he landed two major unconventional roles, forever changing his image to audiences. He played the title character in Tim Burton&#x27;s horror-comedy &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, earning Keaton widespread acclaim and boosting him to Hollywood&#x27;s A list. That same year, he also gave an acclaimed dramatic performance as a drug-addicted realtor in Glenn Gordon Caron&#x27;s &quot;Clean and Sober&quot;.

===1989–1999: Established actor===
Keaton&#x27;s career was given another major boost when he was again cast by Tim Burton, this time as the title comic book superhero of the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;. Warner Bros. received thousands of written complaints from fans who believed Keaton was the wrong choice to portray Batman. However, Keaton&#x27;s performance in the role ultimately earned widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences, and &quot;Batman&quot; became one of 1989&#x27;s most successful films.

According to Les Daniels&#x27;s reference book &quot;Batman: The Complete History&quot;, Keaton initially believed the film would be similar in tone to the 1960s TV series starring Adam West but he understood the darker, brooding side of Batman the film was going for after reading Frank Miller&#x27;s comic book miniseries, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, which he portrayed to much fan approval. Keaton later reprised the role for the sequel &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), which was another critically acclaimed success. He was initially set to reprise the role again for a third Batman film, even going as far as to show up for costume fitting. However, when Burton was dropped as director of the film, Keaton left the franchise as well. He was reportedly dissatisfied with the screenplay approved by the new director, Joel Schumacher. According to the A&amp;E &quot;Biography&quot; episode on Keaton, after he had refused the first time (after meetings with Schumacher), Warner Bros. offered him $15 million, but Keaton steadfastly refused and was replaced by Val Kilmer in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995).

Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990), &quot;One Good Cop&quot; (1991), &quot;My Life&quot; (1993) and the star-studded Shakespearean story &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993). He starred in &quot;The Paper&quot; (1994) and &quot;Multiplicity&quot; (1996), and twice in the same role, that of Elmore Leonard character Agent Ray Nicolette, in the films &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; (1997) and &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998). He made the family holiday movie &quot;Jack Frost&quot; (1998) and the thriller &quot;Desperate Measures&quot; (1998). Keaton starred as a political candidate&#x27;s speechwriter in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Speechless&quot;.

===2000–2013: Limited roles and venture into voice acting===

In the early 2000s, Keaton appeared in several films with mixed success, including &quot;Live From Baghdad&quot; (2002, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award), &quot;First Daughter&quot; (2004, playing the President of the United States), &quot;White Noise&quot; (2005) and &quot;&quot; (2005). While he continued to receive good notices from the critics (particularly for &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;), he was not able to re-approach the box-office success of &quot;Batman&quot; until the release of Disney/Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; (2006), in which he voiced Chick Hicks, a green race car with a mustache, who frequently loses his patience with losing to his longtime rival, Strip Weathers, a.k.a. The King, voiced by Richard Petty. On New Year&#x27;s Day of 2004, he hosted the PBS TV special &quot;Mr. Rogers: America&#x27;s Favorite Neighbor&quot;. It was released by Triumph Marketing LLC on DVD September 28, 2004. In 2006, he starred in &quot;Game 6&quot;, about the 1986 World Series bid by the Boston Red Sox. He had a cameo in the Tenacious D short film &quot;Time Fixers&quot;, an iTunes exclusive. The 9-minute film was released to coincide with &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;. Keaton reportedly was cast as Jack Shephard in the series &quot;Lost&quot;, with the understanding that the role of Jack would be a brief one. Once the role was retooled to be a long-running series regular, Keaton withdrew. The part was then given to actor Matthew Fox. The show ran for six seasons, with the Shephard role continuing throughout.

Keaton starred in the 2007 TV miniseries &quot;The Company&quot;, set during the Cold War, in which he portrayed the real-life CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton. The role garnered Keaton a 2008 Screen Actors Guild nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries. Keaton provided the voice of Ken in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010). The film received overwhelmingly positive acclaim and grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it one of the most financially successful films ever. He played Captain Gene Mauch in the comedy &quot;The Other Guys&quot; (2010).

===2014–2019: Renewed critical success===

In 2014 he played the OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars in the &quot;RoboCop&quot; remake as a more active antagonist, taking RoboCop&#x27;s wife and child hostage, forcing Joel Kinnaman&#x27;s character to struggle to overcome the 4th directive.

Keaton starred alongside Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts in Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s &quot;Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&quot; (2014), playing Riggan Thomson, a screen actor, famous for playing the titular superhero, who puts on a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver short story to regain his former glory. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for his portrayal of Thomson and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. In 2015, Keaton appeared as Walter V. Robinson in Tom McCarthy&#x27;s Academy Award-winning film &quot;Spotlight&quot;, and in 2016, he starred as businessman Ray Kroc in the biopic &quot;The Founder&quot;. On July 28, 2016, Keaton was honored with the 2,585th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to film. The star is located at 6931 Hollywood Blvd. In 2017, Keaton played the supervillain in &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming.&quot; While making this film Keaton was unable to reprise the role of Chick Hicks for Disney and Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars 3&quot; and was replaced by Bob Peterson. Later that year, Keaton portrayed Stan Hurley in &quot;American Assassin&quot;.

In 2019, he played the villain in Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of &quot;Dumbo&quot; directed by Tim Burton, co-starring with Colin Farrell and Eva Green. Keaton later said: &quot;I was clueless on &quot;Dumbo&quot;. I sucked in &quot;Dumbo&quot;.&quot; 

===2020–present: Continued acclaim and reprising past roles ===
In 2020, Keaton appeared in a small role as U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark in &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot;, a legal drama directed by Aaron Sorkin about seven anti-Vietnam protesters charged with inciting riots in 1968.

In 2021, Keaton starred as American lawyer Kenneth Feinberg in the Netflix biographical drama film &quot;Worth&quot;. He then starred in the Hulu miniseries &quot;Dopesick.&quot; He won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for his role. Keaton cites his performance in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Clean and Sober&quot; as an early preparation for &quot;Dopesick&quot;. In 2022, he briefly reprised his role as Vulture in the Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film &quot;Morbius&quot;, which released on April 1, 2022.

In 2023, Keaton reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, after last playing the role in 1992, in the DC Extended Universe superhero film &quot;The Flash.&quot; He filmed scenes to reprise the character in &quot;Batgirl&quot; starring Leslie Grace, set for a release on HBO Max, taking some inspiration from the acclaimed DC Animated Universe animated series &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; with Keaton playing the elder Bruce Wayne as the title character&#x27;s mentor and remote coordinator in the Batcave, only for the film&#x27;s release to be cancelled in August 2022. Keaton stated that he didn&#x27;t care about that decision because he had made money making the film, though he said he felt badly for the film&#x27;s directors. He also reprised the character in the 2023 film &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot;, in an ultimately deleted scene. Keaton also starred in and directed the 2023 noir thriller &quot;Knox Goes Away.&quot;

In 2024, Keaton reprised his role as Betelgeuse for &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;. Keaton next starred in &quot;Goodrich&quot;, a film about a man whose second wife suddenly leaves him, forcing him to take sole care of their nine-year-old twins. Directed by Hallie Meyers-Shyer, filming was set to commence in October 2019, but after a delay ultimately began in April 2023.

==Personal life==
Keaton was married to Caroline McWilliams from 1982 to 1990. They have a son, Sean, born in 1983. Through their son, Keaton and McWilliams have two grandchildren. Keaton had a relationship with actress Courteney Cox from 1990 to 1995.

Keaton, a longtime Pittsburgh resident and fan of its sports teams, negotiated a break in his &quot;Batman&quot; movie contract in case the Pittsburgh Pirates made the playoffs that year, although they ultimately did not. Keaton did however take time off from filming the sequel &quot;Batman Returns&quot; in order to return to Pittsburgh to support the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals. Keaton has been seen regularly at Penguins home playoff games. Keaton also often attends Pittsburgh Steelers games and, during the 2005 AFC Championship Game, he wandered onto the camera frame of the KDKA pregame coverage, surprising reporter John Steigerwald. He also wrote an ESPN blog on the Pirates during the final months of their 2013 season.

In the 1980s, Keaton bought a ranch near Big Timber, Montana, where he spends much of his time. An avid fisherman, he is often seen on the saltwater fishing series &quot;Buccaneers &amp; Bones&quot; on Outdoor Channel, along with Tom Brokaw, Zach Gilford, Thomas McGuane, and Yvon Chouinard, among others.

=== Political views and activism ===
Keaton supported Barack Obama in 2008, Hillary Clinton for president in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Keaton has said that he tries to be judicious in choosing when to become involved in politics, as his fame can be detrimental.

<text>Jonathan Lee Miller (born 15 November 1972) is an English actor. He achieved early success for his portrayal of Simon &quot;Sick Boy&quot; Williamson in the dark comedy-drama film &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1996) and as Dade Murphy in &quot;Hackers&quot; (1995) before earning further critical recognition for his performances in &quot;Afterglow&quot; (1997), &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1999), &quot;Mindhunters&quot; (2004), &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot; (2006), &quot;Endgame&quot; (2009), and &quot;T2 Trainspotting&quot; (2017). For &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot; he received a London Film Critics&#x27; Circle nomination for Actor of the Year. He was also part of the principal cast in the films &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; (2004), &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (2012), and &quot;Byzantium&quot; (2013). He has appeared in several theatrical productions, most notably &quot;After Miss Julie&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, the latter of which earned him an Olivier Award for Best Actor.

Miller starred as the title character in the ABC comedy drama &quot;Eli Stone&quot;, for which he received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actor. This was followed by another starring role in the BBC costume drama &quot;Emma&quot; and a supporting role as Jordan Chase in the fifth season of the Showtime drama &quot;Dexter&quot;. From 2012 to 2019, he starred as a modern-day version of Sherlock Holmes in the CBS crime drama &quot;Elementary&quot;, which earned him his second Satellite Award nomination for Best Actor. In 2022, he played British prime minister John Major in the fifth season of the Netflix historical drama &quot;The Crown&quot;.

==Early life==
Miller was born on 15 November 1972, in Kingston-upon-Thames, Greater London and was raised in south-west London. The son of Ann (née Lee) and Alan Miller, he was inspired by his parents to go into acting. Both were theatre actors. His grandfather was actor Bernard Lee, who played M in the first eleven James Bond films.

Miller attended Tiffin School as a child. He appeared in several school plays such as &quot;The Ragged Child&quot; and performed as part of the &quot;Tiffin Swing Band&quot;. He joined the National Youth Music Theatre, where he met fellow actor Jude Law. He left school, aged 16, after taking his GCSEs, to pursue an acting career.

==Career==

===Television===
Miller made his television debut with an uncredited appearance in the BBC series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; at the age of nine in the 1982 episode &quot;Kinda&quot;. The following year he appeared in &quot;Jemima Shore&quot; and had a role as Charles Price in the serial drama &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;. In 1991, he co-starred with Alexei Sayle in &quot;″Itch&quot;, which was broadcast on Channel 4 as part of the 4 Play strand, a platform for a series of one-off plays that ran from 1989 to 1991. The play was written by Alexei Sayle and David Stafford. Miller played Dennis Turnbull, the teenaged son of Gordon and Susan Turnbull. He then appeared in various television shows throughout the 1990s. These included &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; in 1990, followed by &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; and &quot;Minder&quot; in 1991. He appeared in two separate guest roles in the ITV police drama &quot;The Bill&quot;, one in 1991 and another in 1993, as well as single-episode roles in the BBC drama &quot;Between the Lines&quot; and the medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot;, both of which were broadcast in 1992.

In 1993&#x27;s third instalment of &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;, Miller played a young man who had been victimised as a child by a paedophile. His first notable acting role that year was in the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, wherein he played Jonathan Hewitt. Miller later revealed he had been offered a contract to remain on the show but declined: &quot;It was five weeks&#x27; work and I made more money there than I ever had in my life. Then they offered me a year&#x27;s contract. I said no, thank God. I thought I should get out of there while I still could.&quot;

In 2003, Miller appeared in the BBC modernisation of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; in the episode &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; and had a starring role as Lord Byron in the television film &quot;Byron&quot;. He then starred alongside Ray Liotta in the CBS drama &quot;Smith&quot;. However, the show was cancelled after only seven episodes. Miller was then cast as the title character in the legal comedy drama &quot;Eli Stone&quot;. The show ran for two seasons on ABC and he received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actor. He then co-starred with Romola Garai in the 2009 BBC costume drama &quot;Emma&quot; as George Knightley.

Miller appeared in a guest role as Jordan Chase in the fifth season of the Showtime drama &quot;Dexter&quot;, for which he received a nomination for Screen Actors Guild Award for being part of the main cast in the category of Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. In early 2010, it was reported he was set to portray Rick Grimes in the television adaptation of the comic &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. It was later revealed that Andrew Lincoln had been cast. In 2011, Miller auditioned for the role of Sherlock Holmes in the CBS adaptation based on the works of Arthur Conan Doyle. He originally turned down the part, as he feared it would be too similar to the BBC version &quot;Sherlock&quot;. However, after reviewing the script he accepted the part, and it was officially announced he would star in &quot;Elementary&quot;, alongside Lucy Liu. This earned him his second Satellite Award nomination for Best Actor.

In 2021, it was announced that he was to star in season five of &quot;The Crown&quot;, as former British Prime Minister John Major.

===Film===
He first starred in the film &quot;Hackers&quot; (1995), with Angelina Jolie, whom he married in 1996. Shortly after &quot;Hackers&quot;, Miller was cast as Sick Boy in &quot;Trainspotting&quot;. He was suggested for the role by Ewan McGregor. The accent he used in the film was regarded as convincing, leading some people to incorrectly believe that he was Scottish. Miller has stated: &quot;I had to do a lot of work. I read and re-read the book and I pretended to be Scottish all the time I was in Glasgow, hanging around with Scots, picking up bits and pieces on the street and in bars. Everyone&#x27;s been very encouraging and Danny [Boyle, the director] thinks that I&#x27;ve got it about right. Of course, the others are from all over Scotland and have different accents themselves, so I&#x27;ve tried to just pick up a general, composite accent.&quot;

In 1997, he played Billy Prior in the film adaptation of Pat Barker&#x27;s World War I novel &quot;Regeneration&quot;. In 2000, he played Cameron Colley in &quot;Complicity&quot;, based on the book by Iain Banks. He co-starred in the film &quot;Love, Honour and Obey&quot; as Johnny, a London street kid getting mixed up with a notorious British gangster. Also in 2000, he appeared as Simon Sheppard in Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;. In 2006 Miller portrayed cyclist Graeme Obree in &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot;.

He was considered as the third teammate to join Ben Fogle and James Cracknell in Team QinetiQ for the Amundsen Omega 3 South Pole Race in January 2009. He participated in training for the event in Norway, which was televised for a BBC2 documentary series &quot;On Thin Ice&quot;. He was not able to attend the race because of filming commitments, after &quot;Eli Stone&quot; was extended for a second season.

In 1997, he was involved with the creation and operation of the production company Natural Nylon with friend Jude Law. The company folded in 2003.

===Theatre===
In November 1999, he played Brito in Paul Corcoran&#x27;s &quot;Four Nights in Knaresborough&quot; at the Tricycle Theatre, London. In March 2011, at the Royal National Theatre, he played both Victor Frankenstein and Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster on alternate nights, opposite Benedict Cumberbatch, in a stage adaptation of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Directed by Danny Boyle, the play was broadcast to cinemas worldwide as part of National Theatre Live on 17 March 2011 and additional dates throughout March and April. He also appeared on Broadway in a production of &quot;After Miss Julie&quot;, with his performance receiving very positive reviews. In March 2004, he played Christian in &quot;Festen&quot; by David Eldridge at The Almeida Theatre in London.

===Awards and honours===
* Laurence Olivier Award (2012)
* Satellite Award (2008, 2012)
* IQ Award (2014). Mensa members nominated Edward Snowden for the 2014 IQ Award, but the managing board of Mensa revoked Snowden&#x27;s nomination because &quot;Mensa is not allowed to comment on political issues.&quot; In protest, Miller was nominated for his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, and he ultimately won the award.

==Personal life==
Miller married actress Angelina Jolie on 28 March 1996. They separated 18 months later, and were divorced in 2000; however, they remain close friends. He began dating actress and model Michele Hicks in 2006. They married in July 2008 in Malibu, California. The couple have one son, Buster Timothy Miller, born in December 2008. They divorced in 2018.

He is a marathon runner, often supporting the charity Mencap. Miller was signed up to run the 2006 &quot;Marathon des Sables&quot; but dropped out due to filming commitments. He ran the 2008 London Marathon in 3:01:40. Miller is an advocate for finding treatment and cure for Sanfilippo syndrome. In 2014, he addressed the Congressional caucus in Washington, D.C., on behalf of rare disease organisations, in the hope of securing funding for treatment research.

In November 2014, he became an American citizen. He is qualified as a volunteer firefighter in New York.

===Muay Thai===

Miller has trained in both Muay Thai and Brazilian jiu-jitsu at Evolution Muay Thai in New York City. In May 2018, he took part in an exhibition Muay Thai bout held at Chok Sabai Gym in New York City, which followed a five-week training camp leading up to the event.

On 1 February 2019, Miller made his Muay Thai debut at Broad Street Ballroom in New York City. He won the fight by knockout in the final round.
