<text>Edgar Yipsel Harburg (born Isidore Hochberg; April 8, 1896 – March 5, 1981) was an American popular song lyricist and librettist who worked with many well-known composers. He wrote the lyrics to the standards &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; (with Jay Gorney), &quot;April in Paris&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;, as well as all of the songs for the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, including &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. He was known for the social commentary of his lyrics, as well as his leftist leanings. He championed racial, sexual and gender equality and union politics. He also was an ardent critic of high society and religion.

==Early life and career==
Harburg, the youngest of four surviving children (out of ten), was born Isidore Hochberg on the Lower East Side of New York City on April 8, 1896. His parents, Lewis Hochberg and Mary Ricing, were Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jews who had emigrated from Russia.

He later adopted the name &quot;Edgar Yipsel Harburg,&quot; and came to be best known as &quot;Yip.&quot; It has been claimed that Harburg took the name &quot;Yipsel&quot; because it meant &quot;squirrel&quot; in Yiddish, but there is no such Yiddish word and it is likely that the name was derived from that of the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League (1907), the youth group of the Socialist Party of America, whose members were called &quot;yipsels.&quot;

Harburg attended Townsend Harris High School, where he and Ira Gershwin, who bonded over a shared fondness for Gilbert and Sullivan, worked on the school paper and became lifelong friends. According to his son Ernie Harburg, Gilbert and Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw taught his father—a &quot;democratic socialist, [and] sworn challenger of all tyranny against the people&quot;—that &quot;&#x27;humor is an act of courage&#x27; and dissent&quot;.

After World War I, Harburg returned to New York and graduated from City College (later part of the City University of New York), which Ira Gershwin had initially attended with him, in 1921. After Harburg married and had two children, he started writing light verse for local newspapers. He became a co-owner of Consolidated Electrical Appliance Company, but the company went bankrupt following the crash of 1929, leaving Harburg &quot;anywhere from $50,000 – $70,000 in debt,&quot; which he insisted on paying back over the course of the next few decades. At this point, Harburg and Ira Gershwin agreed that Harburg should start writing song lyrics.

Gershwin introduced Harburg to Jay Gorney, who collaborated with him on songs for an Earl Carroll Broadway review (&quot;Earl Carroll&#x27;s Sketchbook&quot;): the show was successful and Harburg was engaged as lyricist for a series of successful revues, including &quot;Americana&quot; in 1932, for which he wrote the lyrics of &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; to the tune of a lullaby Gorney had learned as a child in Russia. This song swept the nation, becoming an anthem of the Great Depression.

Harburg was a staunch critic of both high society and religion. He wrote a poem entitled &quot;Atheist&quot; that summarized his views on God.

==Hollywood and Broadway==
Harburg and Gorney were offered a contract with Paramount: in Hollywood, Harburg worked with composers Harold Arlen, Vernon Duke, Jerome Kern, Jule Styne, and Burton Lane, and later wrote the lyrics for &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; one of the earliest known &quot;integrated musicals,&quot; for which he won the Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song for &quot;Over the Rainbow.&quot;

Of his work on &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; his son (and biographer) Ernie Harburg has said:

Working in Hollywood did not stop Harburg&#x27;s career on Broadway. In the 1940s, he wrote a series of &quot;book&quot; musicals with social messages, including the successful &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot; (1944), set during the Civil War, which was about temperance and women&#x27;s rights activist Amelia Bloomer, and which celebrated equality for women, Abolitionism, and the Underground Railroad. Harburg&#x27;s best known Broadway show, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1947) was, in its original production, possibly the first Broadway musical with a racially integrated chorus line, and features his &quot;When the Idle Poor Become the Idle Rich.&quot; Its plot satirized American financial practices and criticized reactionist politicians, mistreatment of the working classes as well as racism and the Jim Crow laws. It was made into a film in 1968 starring Fred Astaire and Petula Clark, directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

==Blacklisting==
Although never a member of the Communist Party (he was a member of the Socialist Party, and joked that &quot;Yip&quot; referred to the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League, nicknamed the &quot;Yipsels&quot;) Harburg had been involved in radical groups, and was blacklisted.

Harburg was named in a pamphlet &quot;Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television&quot;; his involvement with the Hollywood Democratic Committee, and his refusal to identify reputed communists, led to him being blocked from working in Hollywood films, television, and radio for twelve full years, from 1950 to 1962. &quot;As the writer of the lyric of the song &#x27;God&#x27;s Country&#x27;, I am outraged by the suggestion that somehow I am connected with, believe in, or am sympathetic with Communist or totalitarian philosophy&quot;, he wrote to the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1950. He was unable to travel abroad during this period because his passport had been revoked. With a score by Sammy Fain and Harburg&#x27;s lyrics, the musical &quot;Flahooley&quot; (1951) satirized the country&#x27;s anti-communist sentiment, but it closed after forty performances at the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway. The New York critics were dismissive of the show, although it had been a success during its earlier pre-Broadway run in Philadelphia.

==Later career==
In 1966, songwriter Earl Robinson sought Harburg&#x27;s help for the song &quot;Hurry Sundown&quot;; the two collaborated on the song and are credited as co-writers. The song was intended for the film &quot;Hurry Sundown&quot;, but was not used in the film. It was, however, recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary for their 1966 album &quot;The Peter, Paul and Mary Album&quot;. The song was released as a single in 1967, and reached No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Easy Listening chart. It was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording.

==Death==
Harburg died while driving on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles on March 5, 1981, at the age of 84. While he was initially reported to have been killed in a traffic accident, it was later determined that he suffered a heart attack while stopped at a red light.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1940 Harburg won an Oscar, shared with Harold Arlen, for Best Music, Original Song
for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). In addition, he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Music, Original Song, along with Arlen,
for &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;, (1943) and Best Music, Original Song
for &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Singing&quot;, shared with Jerome Kern in (1944).

Harburg was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972.

On March 7, 2001, the results of a poll conducted by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Humanities ranked Judy Garland&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; as the Number One recording of the 20th century.

On June 22, 2004, the American Film Institute broadcast &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Songs&quot;, a TV special announcing the 100 greatest film songs. &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; was Number One, and &quot;Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead&quot; was Number 82.

In April 2005, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp recognizing Harburg&#x27;s accomplishments. The stamp was drawn from a portrait taken by photographer Barbara Bordnick in 1978 along with a rainbow and lyric from &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. The first day ceremony was held at the 92nd Street Y in New York.

<text>Kalitta Air is an American cargo airline headquartered at Willow Run Airport, Ypsilanti Township, Michigan. The company operates international scheduled and cargo charter services. Its call sign &quot;Connie&quot; is from its founder, Connie Kalitta.

==History==
In 1967, Conrad &quot;Connie&quot; Kalitta started the airline as Connie Kalitta Services, a business carrying car parts using a twin engine Cessna 310 that he piloted. The airline&#x27;s name would later become American International Airways in 1984. At this point, the fleet consisted of Boeing 747, Lockheed L-1011, Douglas DC-8, Twin Beech, and Learjet aircraft, for air freight, air ambulance, and charter passenger operations.


The &quot;American International Airways&quot; brand name was also used by a charter and scheduled passenger airline which in 1981 was operating a hub located at the Philadelphia International Airport with nonstop service to Atlantic City, Boston, Chicago Midway, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Norfolk, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Tampa, and West Palm Beach flown with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 and MD-80 jets. The airline declared bankruptcy on July 19, 1984, and ceased operations in September. Kalitta, however, continued using the AIA name, as &quot;Kalitta|American International Airways&quot; for cargo-only flights until 1997.

During the late 1980s, the Kalitta brand name continued to appear on many of the company&#x27;s cargo aircraft. In 1990 and 1991, AIA flew 600 missions in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

In 1997, AIA merged with Kitty Hawk Inc., and Conrad Kalitta resigned to start Kalitta Leasing for buying, selling, and leasing large aircraft. In April 2000, Kitty Hawk International (the former AIA) ceased operations. Kalitta decided to rescue it and the new airline, Kalitta Air, began operations in November 2000, using the operating certificate and assets of the former airline.

On April 21, 2017, Kalitta Air retired its final Boeing 747-200F from service. This was one of the relatively few then remaining in service. Twenty-six other Boeing 747 aircraft are still active in Kalitta&#x27;s fleet.

Kalitta Maintenance operates a maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility at Oscoda–Wurtsmith Airport in Iosco County, Michigan.

In 2020, the United States Department of State employed Kalitta Air to evacuate U.S. nationals from Wuhan at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Citing instructions from the State Department, company Pete Sanderlin declined to give the Detroit Free Press comment. The National Museum of American Diplomacy&#x27;s collection of artifacts includes a commemorative patch honoring the &quot;Wuhan Evac Team&quot; featuring a Kalitta Air plane. It has the dates &quot;01-27-20 to 02-08-20&quot; and four N-numbers, N705CK, N706CK, N708CK, and N713CK.

==Destinations==
The airline provides domestic and international scheduled or on-demand cargo service and support for the requirements of the Department of Defense Air Mobility Command.

In January 2003, Kalitta Air announced the start of scheduled cargo flights from the United States to Europe. The freighters on this service operated from JFK (John F. Kennedy Airport, New York) EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport, New Jersey) and ORD (O’Hare, Chicago) to AMS (Schiphol, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and EMA (East Midlands Airport, England). The airline flies scheduled cargo operations between the U.S. and Hong Kong, U.S. and Germany (Leipzig/Halle Airport), U.S. and Korea (for Asiana), Los Angeles and Honolulu. Liège Airport was also used as a regular refueling stop on New York City – Middle East routes and in the Caribbean, Norman Manley International Airport.

As of February 2020, Kalitta Air serves the following destinations with cargo flights on a regular, scheduled basis:

==Incidents and accidents==
* On August 18, 1993, American International Airways Flight 808, a Douglas DC-8-61 (N814CK) with three crew members on board struck level terrain 1,400 feet west of the approach end of the runway while landing at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The aircraft approached from the south and was making a right turn for runway 10 with an increasing angle of bank in order to align with the runway. At 200–300 feet AGL the wings started to rock towards wings level and the nose pitched up. The right wing appeared to stall, the aircraft rolled to a 90-degree angle of bank and the nose pitched down. All three crew members survived with serious injuries, though the aircraft was completely destroyed by the impact and post-crash fire. Probable cause of the accident was attributed primarily to the impaired judgment, decision-making, and flying abilities of the captain and flight crew due to the effects of fatigue resulting from extended flight/duty hours. This accident was also featured in the 19th season of &quot;Mayday/Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Borderline Tactics&quot;.
*On October 20, 2004, a Kalitta Air Boeing 747 (N709CK) with five crew members on board experienced mechanical difficulties with one of the four engines and diverted to land safely at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. No one was injured. It was discovered after landing that the number 1 engine had separated from the airplane as it climbed through 16,000 feet over Lake Michigan. The engine was later recovered for inspection.
*During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict (2nd Lebanon war) Kalitta Air made weapon supply flights from the United States to Israel, via Prestwick Airport in Scotland for refueling, without authority from the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority. Scotland&#x27;s Crown Office considered, but eventually decided against, prosecuting Kalitta Air for two July 2006 flights carrying laser-guided bombs.
*On May 25, 2008, a Boeing 747-209F/SCD (N704CK), operating as Flight 207 overran runway 20 at Brussels Airport. The aircraft broke in three and came to a complete stop in a field bordering the runway. There were four crew members and one passenger on board, and no injuries were reported. The aircraft destined for Bahrain International Airport was loaded with 76 tons of goods, half of which was diplomatic mail. Belgian investigators announced that the accident was caused by the decision to reject the take-off 12 knots after passing V1 speed following a bird strike. The Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) of the Federal Public Service Mobility and Transport had investigated the accident.
* On July 7, 2008, a Boeing 747-209B (N714CK), operating for Centurion Air Cargo as Flight 164 crashed shortly after departing from El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá at 3:55 a.m. The aircraft was en route to Miami, Florida, with a shipment of flowers. After reporting a fire in the number 4 engine, the crew attempted the return to the airport. However, after engine number 1 failed as well, the aircraft could not maintain altitude and crashed near the village of Madrid, Colombia. The aircraft&#x27;s empennage hit a ranch house, killing a 50-year-old man and his 13-year-old son who lived there. The flight deck separated from the remainder of the aircraft, and the crew of eight survived with light to serious injuries while the rest of the airframe was consumed by fire.
* On March 29, 2019, a Boeing 747 (N740CK) departing from Brussels Airport allegedly experienced a compression failure in one of the engines at two minutes into the flight. The aircraft was diverted over the North Sea to burn fuel and landed in Leipzig.
*On September 30, 2021, a Boeing 747-400 (N741CK) operated as Flight K4330 from Leipzig (Germany) to East Midlands, EN (UK), landed on East Midlands&#x27; runway 27 when shortly after touchdown and after engaging spoilers and reverse thrust the #3 engine suffered a compressor stall and emitted a loud bang with flames.
*On December 15, 2022, a Kalitta Air Boeing 747-400(BCF) (N744CK), en route from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, was forced to divert to John G. Diefenbaker International Airport in Saskatoon, Canada, due to false fire alarm in the forward cargo hold.
*On August 7, 2023, a Kalitta Air Boeing 747-481F (N401KZ), operating from Anchorage to Ningbo, China, suffered a runway excursion upon landing at Ningbo Lishe International Airport. There were no injuries.

==Media appearances==
* For the 1997 film &quot;Air Force One&quot;, the producers rented one of Kalitta&#x27;s Boeing 747-146 aircraft N703CK and repainted it to replicate the iconic Air Force One livery.
* The TV program &quot;MythBusters&quot; featured one of Kalitta&#x27;s Boeing 747s (tail number N700CK) in Episode 90: &quot;Supersized Myths”, that originally aired on November 14, 2007. In this myth the build team revisited the myth of &quot;Jet Taxi&quot;, the story of a taxi that got stuck behind a jet taking off resulting in the taxi flipping over due to the jet blast. This myth was found to be confirmed, in that a jet could flip a taxi as well as a school bus and a light aircraft. &quot;MythBusters&quot; featured another Kalitta Air 747 (tail number N709CK) in the episode &quot;Storm Chasing Myths&quot; that originally aired on October 13, 2010, using the jet exhaust to simulate the wind speed of a tornado.
* Global News in Canada carried a story about a Kalitta Air 747 that carried Canadians who were stranded in quarantine on the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California. It landed at CFB Trenton in Ontario on March 10, 2020, where the passengers were quarantined for 14 days due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
* Kalitta&#x27;s Boeing 747-400F (N716CK) can be seen in the documentary &quot;The Last Cruise&quot; evacuating U.S. citizens stranded aboard &quot;Diamond Princess&quot; cruise ship during COVID-19 outbreak.
*N707CK, a former Kuwait Airways 747-269B, was used for the filming of the movie &quot;Executive Decision&quot;. The aircraft was painted into the fictitious &quot;Oceanic Airlines&quot; paint scheme.

<text>Sir Adams George Archibald (May 3, 1814 – December 14, 1892) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, and a Father of Confederation. He was based in Nova Scotia for most of his career, though he also served as first Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1870 to 1872.

Archibald was born in Truro to a prominent family in Nova Scotian politics. He was the son of Samuel Archibald, and grandson of James Archibald, judge of the court of common pleas, Nova Scotia. He was also related to Samuel G. W. Archibald, who had served as the province&#x27;s Attorney General from 1830 to 1841. Sir Adams Archibald studied science and medicine for a few years, subsequently articled in law, and was called to the Nova Scotia bar in January 1839. He held a number of local offices over the next decade, and was appointed a probate judge in 1848.

==Political career==
Archibald was elected to the Nova Scotia legislature in 1851 as a supporter of Joseph Howe&#x27;s governing Reformers, topping the poll in the two-member riding of Colchester County. Once in the legislature, Archibald frequently took positions that were opposed by other members of the Liberal caucus. He supported elected municipal governments, for instance, and was a vociferous proponent of taxation for a state-run school system (regarded by many Nova Scotia Liberals as an unnecessary expense). Archibald also supported reciprocity with the United States, and opposed any efforts to expand the province&#x27;s electoral franchise.

Archibald was re-elected in 1855, and was appointed Solicitor General of Nova Scotia on August 14, 1856. His term in office was cut short by a sectarian quarrel in the legislature, which occurred after the President of the Charitable Irish Society was dismissed from his government job and charged with treason. The Liberal government had previously been supported by a majority of the province&#x27;s Catholic population, but in early 1857 eight Catholic Liberals and two Protestant Liberals from Catholic ridings defected to the Conservative opposition, which was then able to form government. Archibald was forced to resign his position on February 21, 1857.

In the provincial election of 1859, Howe&#x27;s Liberals were returned to office on a platform of defending Protestant interests. This was essentially a cynical appeal to popular prejudice, and no significant actions were taken against the province&#x27;s Catholics following the election. Archibald did not run, but was nevertheless appointed Attorney General in Howe&#x27;s government on February 10, 1860. He returned to parliament following a by-election victory on March 8, 1860. In his new capacity, Archibald was a leading proponent of provincial railway development, even following the economic downturn of 1862.

In December 1862, Premier Howe was appointed Imperial Fisheries Commissioner by the British government. Archibald succeeded him as Liberal leader, although Howe continued to serve as Premier until the next election was called.

In early 1863, Howe&#x27;s outgoing ministry passed a bill which re-introduced property qualifications for voters. The bill did not become law before the provincial election of May 1863, however, and it was largely due to the bill&#x27;s unpopularity that Archibald&#x27;s Liberals were dealt a crushing defeat. The party won only 14 seats out of 55, though Archibald was personally re-elected in Colchester South.

Despite serving as leader of the opposition from 1863 to 1867, Archibald frequently sided with the Conservative ministry against his own caucus on important legislative initiatives. He supported the education tax plan put forward by Charles Tupper&#x27;s government, although it was opposed by most members of his own party. Archibald was later the Nova Scotia Liberal Party&#x27;s representative to the first conference on Canadian Confederation, held at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island in 1864. Following the conference, he was the &quot;only&quot; member of the Liberal caucus to support Nova Scotia&#x27;s entry into confederation.

Archibald faced a leadership challenge from anti-confederate William Annand in 1866, but emerged victorious. When Nova Scotia joined the new nation of Canada on July 1, 1867, Archibald was appointed Secretary of State for the Provinces in the cabinet of John A. Macdonald.

Nova Scotia&#x27;s political system was transformed by the debate on Confederation, and its concurrent provincial and federal elections in September 1867 were fought by Confederation and anti-Confederation parties, rather than by Liberals and Conservatives. The Confederation Party suffered a massive defeat, and Archibald (despite spending a very large sum of money) was defeated by Archibald McLelan in the riding of Colchester. He resigned his cabinet post on April 30, 1868.

Popular opinion in Nova Scotia subsequently shifted in favour of Confederation, particularly after one-time anti-confederate Joseph Howe joined Macdonald&#x27;s government in 1869. McLelan followed Howe to the Confederation side, and was appointed to the Senate in August 1869. This allowed Archibald to run for the riding in a by-election, in which he defeated Liberal Frederick Pearson, 1585 votes to 1230. Archibald was by this time a Liberal-Conservative, and continued to support the Macdonald government in parliament (though he was not re-appointed to cabinet).

In 1870, Archibald gave a speech in favour of conciliation towards the leaders of the Red River Rebellion in Manitoba. This was noticed by George-Étienne Cartier, who was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Canadian government while Macdonald was recovering from a serious illness. Cartier asked Archibald to become the first Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and the Northwest Territories. Although he had little interest in the region, he agreed on condition that he be appointed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia after serving a single term.

Archibald was sworn into office in August 1870, in Niagara Falls, Ontario. He then travelled to Manitoba, and began piecing together the province&#x27;s first government. There was considerable antagonism between the province&#x27;s Métis population and recently arrived soldiers from Ontario, and Archibald had difficulties finding suitable candidates to work with him. Until January 1871, the only members of his cabinet were local merchant Alfred Boyd and Marc-Amable Girard, a recent arrival from Quebec. Archibald himself was the province&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; Premier, and often determined policy without consulting his ministers.

Despite opposition from many of the province&#x27;s Anglophones, Archibald was able to settle the province&#x27;s electoral boundaries by December 1870. Archibald himself was the leader of the government side in the election which followed; the francophone population was mostly united in support of him, while John Christian Schultz led a group of ultra-loyalist Anglophones who opposed the conciliation policy. Archibald was successful, as Schultz&#x27;s opposition won only five seats and Schultz was personally defeated in Winnipeg and St. John.

Archibald put together a five-member cabinet in January 1871, which included Boyd, Girard, Henry Joseph Clarke, James Mackay and Thomas Howard — a group which balanced the province&#x27;s ethnic, religious and linguistic divisions. Archibald himself remained the real Premier.

Archibald continued to pursue a policy of conciliation with the province&#x27;s Métis population, encouraging them to register their lands and even meeting with Louis Riel after an armed Métis band had defended the government against Fenian invaders from America. His real intentions were to prevent another Métis uprising in the short-term, and to allow for the gradual hegemony of new Canadian settlers in the region. Nevertheless, the specifics of his conciliation policy were opposed by Macdonald and Howe alike (Howe was by this time Macdonald&#x27;s Indian Affairs minister). In the face of this opposition, Archibald submitted his resignation in late 1871. Macdonald initially had difficulty finding a replacement and asked Archibald to reconsider. The federal government chose Francis Godschall Johnson as his replacement on April 9, 1872, but this commission was revoked before Johnson was sworn in. It was not until October 1872 that Archibald returned to Ontario.

Archibald was not immediately appointed to the Nova Scotia court, and was instead made a director of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in February 1873. He was finally appointed to the bench in June, but withdrew days later to be appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia (former Conservative Premier James W. Johnston initially received this appointment, but withdrew due to ill health). This position required less intervention than Archibald had exercised in Manitoba, although he attended cabinet meetings in 1873 and 1874. After 1876, he came to regard the position as primarily ceremonial, and above partisan concerns.

Archibald served as the 4th Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia until June 1883. In 1886, he became President of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, which he had helped to found six years earlier. He courted controversy by a public defence of the 18th-century Acadian expulsion later in the year. Archibald was also the first historian of Government House (Nova Scotia) and wrote an extensive monograph on the subject.

In 1888, Archibald McLelan was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. McLelan had resigned his Senate seat in 1881 and subsequently returned to the House of Commons. His appointment meant that the riding of Colchester again became vacant, and ironically, Archibald was again prevailed upon to stand for the riding as a Liberal-Conservative candidate. He was re-elected to the Commons on August 15, 1888, 18 years after his previous departure. Archibald was little involved in the activities of the House following his return, and did not make any speeches. Due to ill health, he did not run again in 1891.

==Family==

Hon. Sir Adams George Archibald, K.C.M.G., Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia married Elizabeth A. Burnyeat, daughter of Rev. John Burnyeat. Their daughter Elizabeth Alice Archibald and his son Riley Robert Archibald were born and educated in Nova Scotia. they lived in Ottawa, Ontario, with their parents, while their father was a Minister of the Crown for the three years succeeding Confederation. they went with their parents, on their father&#x27;s appointment as Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba. In December, 1881, Elizabeth Alice married the Right Reverend Dr. Llewellyn Jones, Bishop of Newfoundland. After the couple&#x27;s marriage, they lived at Bishopscourt in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

==Death==
Archibald died on December 14, 1892, at the age of 78 of an unknown illness most likely derived from his old age.

<text>Sir Alexander Campbell (March 9, 1822 – May 24, 1892) was an Upper Canadian statesman and a father of Canadian Confederation.

==Life==
Born in Hedon, Yorkshire, he was brought to Canada by his father, who was a doctor, when he was one year old. He was educated in French at St. Hyacinthe in Quebec and in the grammar school at Kingston, Ontario. Campbell studied law and was called to the bar in 1843. He became a partner in John A. Macdonald&#x27;s law office.

Campbell was a Freemason of St. John&#x27;s Lodge, No. 3 (Ontario) of Kingston (now The Ancient St. John&#x27;s No. 3). When the government was moved to Quebec in 1858, Campbell resigned.

He was elected to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada in 1858 and 1864, and served as the last Commissioner of Crown Lands 30 March 1864 – 30 June 1867. He attended the Charlottetown Conference and the Quebec City Conference in 1864, and at Confederation was appointed to the Senate of Canada. He later held a number of ministerial posts in the Cabinet of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and was the sixth Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1887 to 1892.

Historian Ged Martin discussed the reasons why Campbell never achieved first rank as a politician; he was lame and suffered from epileptic seizures, and his estranged wife was a certified lunatic (see Family section below).

In 1883, he built his home on Metcalfe Street, Ottawa, now known as &quot;Campbell House&quot;.
He died in office in Toronto in 1892, and was buried at Cataraqui Cemetery in Kingston, Ontario.

Campbell Crescent in Kingston, a street in the Portsmouth municipal district, is named in his honour.

==Family==
In 1855, Campbell married Georgina Frederica Locke, daughter of Thomas Sandwith of Beverley, Yorkshire, and a niece of Humphrey Sandwith III (1792–1874) of Bridlington. As Ged Martin has detailed in an article on Campbell&#x27;s private life, the marriage was a failure and his estranged wife spent time in asylums as a certified lunatic. He left two sons (the eldest was Charles Sandwith Campbell) and three daughters.

<doc id="237617" wikidata="Q1321480" url="?curid=237617" title="Anatomical snuffbox">
<text>The anatomical snuff box or snuffbox or foveola radialis is a triangular deepening on the radial, dorsal aspect of the hand—at the level of the carpal bones, specifically, the scaphoid and trapezium bones forming the floor. The name originates from the use of this surface for placing and then sniffing powdered tobacco, or &quot;snuff.&quot; It is sometimes referred to by its French name &quot;tabatière&quot;.

==Structure==
===Boundaries===
* The medial border (ulnar side) of the snuffbox is the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus
* The lateral border (radial side) is a pair of parallel and intimate tendons, of the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis longus. (Accordingly, the anatomical snuffbox is most visible, having a more pronounced concavity, during thumb extension.)
* The proximal border is formed by the styloid process of the radius
* The distal border is formed by the approximate apex of the schematic snuffbox isosceles triangle.
* The floor of the snuffbox varies depending on the position of the wrist, but both the trapezium and primarily the scaphoid can be palpated.

=== Neurovascular anatomy ===
Deep to the tendons which form the borders of the anatomical snuff box lies the radial artery, which passes through the anatomical snuffbox on its course from the normal radial pulse detecting area, to the proximal space in between the first and second metacarpals to contribute to the superficial and deep palmar arches. In the anatomical snuffbox, the radial artery is closely related (&lt;2 mm) with the superficial branch of radial nerve near the styloid process of radius in 48%, while in 24% the radial artery is openly related to the lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm. The cephalic vein arises within the anatomical snuffbox, while the dorsal cutaneous branch of the radial nerve can be palpated by stroking along the extensor pollicis longus with the dorsal aspect of a fingernail.

==Clinical significance==
The radius and scaphoid articulate deep to the snuffbox to form the basis of the wrist joint. In the event of a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH), this is the area through which the brunt of the force will focus. This results in these two bones being the most often fractured of the wrist. In a case where there is localized tenderness within the snuffbox, knowledge of wrist anatomy leads to the speedy conclusion that the fracture is likely to be of the scaphoid. This is understandable as the scaphoid is a small, oddly shaped bone whose purpose is to facilitate mobility rather than confer stability to the wrist joint . In the event of inordinate application of force over the wrist, this small scaphoid is likely to be the weak link . Scaphoid fracture is one of the most frequent causes of medico-legal issues.

An anatomical anomaly in the vascular supply to the scaphoid is the area to which the blood supply is first delivered. Blood enters the scaphoid distally. Consequently, in the event of a fracture the proximal segment of the scaphoid will be devoid of a vascular supply, and will—if action is not taken—avascularly necrose within a sufferer&#x27;s snuffbox. Due to the small size of the scaphoid and its shape, it is difficult to determine, early on, whether or not the scaphoid is indeed fractured with an x-ray. Further complications include; carpal instability (ligament disruption) and fracture-dislocations.

<text>Jean-Charles Chapais, (; December 2, 1811 – July 17, 1885) was a Canadian Conservative politician, and considered a Father of Canadian Confederation for his participation in the Quebec Conference to determine the form of Canada&#x27;s government.

Chapais was born in Rivière-Ouelle, a small town in Kamouraska, Quebec, and was educated in Nicolet.

Following his success as a farmer and merchant, in 1845 he became the first mayor of Saint-Denis-de-la-Bouteillerie, the town he had lived in from 1833. The following year, he married Georgina Dionne; they had six children together.

==Political career==
At the prompting of his father-in-law, Chapais entered regional politics. In 1851, he was elected for the first time to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada; he was eventually to serve a total of five terms representing Kamouraska. A &quot;bleu&quot;, he was a supporter of Augustin-Norbert Morin, Étienne-Paschal Taché and George-Étienne Cartier. He worked to abolish the system of seigneurial tenure in Quebec and reform agricultural legislation.

Following the Charlottetown Conference in September 1864, Chapais attended the Quebec Conference to negotiate on behalf of Canada East for provincial governments to have greater power in the Canadian federal system.

Chapais was Commissioner of Public Works in the Great Coalition of 1864–1867, and is credited with establishing the Intercolonial Railway and expanding the Grand Trunk Railway. In 1867 the British North America Act was passed, creating the Dominion of Canada, and Chapais became the first Minister of Agriculture. At this time, he also switched to representing Champlain in the Quebec legislature, due to a scandal over electoral irregularities in Kamouraska. On 30 January 1868, Jean-Charles Chapais entered the Senate of Canada, and sat in the body until his death.

As Minister, Chapais was in charge of more than simply agriculture: the department was also responsible for the import and export of animals, immigration, the census, patent administration and trademarks, public health, manufacturing, and the arts. After less than three years, he was replaced by Christopher Dunkin, which he greatly resented. His new position of Receiver General for Canada was significantly less prestigious and powerful, requiring little more than making and accepting payments on behalf of the government. (Today, the portfolio has passed to the Minister of Public Works.) Chapais resigned in 1873, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family and business. He is buried in Saint-Denis-De La Bouteillerie, Quebec.

Chapais&#x27; house in Saint-Denis-De La Bouteillerie was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1962.

<doc id="237627" wikidata="Q642382" url="?curid=237627" title="George Brown (Canadian politician)">
<text>George Brown (November 29, 1818 – May 9, 1880) was a Canadian journalist, politician and one of the Fathers of Confederation. He attended the Charlottetown (September 1864) and Quebec (October 1864) conferences. A noted Reform politician, he is best known as the founder and editor of the &quot;Toronto Globe&quot;, Canada&#x27;s most influential newspaper at the time, and his leadership in the founding of the Liberal Party in 1867. He was an articulate champion of the grievances and anger of Upper Canada (Ontario). He played a major role in securing national unity. His career in active politics faltered after 1865, but he remained a powerful spokesman for the Liberal Party. He promoted westward expansion and opposed the policies of Conservative prime minister John A. Macdonald.

==Early life==

===Scotland===
George Brown was born in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland on November 29, 1818. His father, Peter Brown, ran a wholesale business in Edinburgh and managed a glassworks in Alloa. His mother was Marianne ( Mackenzie). George was their eldest son; he had two older sisters, two younger sisters and four younger brothers, although three of the brothers died in infancy. He was baptised in St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Chapel of Ease. He lived in Alloa until he moved to Edinburgh before he turned eight. He attended Royal High School, then transferred to the Southern Academy of Edinburgh.

Upon graduation his father wanted George to attend university but George convinced his father to let him work in the family&#x27;s business. He briefly lived in London to be taught by agents of the business before returning to Edinburgh. He joined the Philo-Lectic Society of Edinburgh, where young men would meet and discuss topics in a parliamentary debate. Brown&#x27;s father also worked as a collector of assessments. Some of the funds he collected for the municipality were mixed with his business bank accounts, and in 1836 some of the funds in these accounts were lost in business speculations. Peter was not accused of corruption, but he sought to repair his reputation and recoup the lost funds. He attempted to collect from people he lent money to but was unable to after the onset of the economic depression in 1837. Peter decided to emigrate to New York City to seek business opportunities and rebuild his reputation. George accompanied his father to North America, and they left Europe in May 1837.

===New York City===

The Browns landed in New York in June 1837. Peter opened a dry goods store on Broadway and George worked as his assistant. The following year, Brown&#x27;s mother and sisters immigrated to New York and the family lived in a rented home on Varick Street. When the store grew larger, George travelled to New England, upstate New York, and Canada to continue growing their business. In July 1842 Peter published the first edition of a newspaper called the &quot;British Chronicle&quot;, which advocated a Whig-Liberal political ideology and published articles on British news and politics. As circulation increased in Canada, the paper devoted articles to the political news in the Province of Canada. George became the paper&#x27;s publisher in March 1843 and travelled to New England, upstate New York, and Canada to promote the paper. While in Canada, Brown spoke with politicians and editors in Toronto, Kingston, and Montreal. Brown might have also been writing articles for the paper; J.M.S. Careless, a historian, notes that a series of articles called &quot;A Tour of Canada&quot; were published in the same writing style of Brown&#x27;s later articles while Brown was in Canada.

Peter Brown supported the evangelical faction during the Disruption of 1843 within the Church of Scotland. These members separated from the Church of Scotland in May 1843 and formed the Free Church of Scotland. While George was touring Canada, they asked him to present an offer to his father: to move publication of the &quot;British Chronicle&quot; to Upper Canada in exchange for a bond of $2500. George supported the proposal, as he felt there were more opportunities to succeed in Canada. He thought that there was hostility towards the paper in New York because of the paper&#x27;s focus on Britain. Upon meeting Reform politicians in his travels through Canada, George felt that they would support his paper should it relocate to the province. George convinced his father to move to Canada and they published the last issue of the &quot;British Chronicle&quot; on July 22, 1843.

===Canada===
George and Peter rented a storefront in Toronto and on August 18, 1843, they published the first edition a new paper called &quot;Banner&quot;. George managed the secular department of the newspaper, commenting on non-religious issues. &quot;Banner&quot; initially did not commit to any political causes, although it supported many policies advocated by Reformers. This changed when the governor-general of the province, Charles Metcalfe, prorogued the Reform-dominated Canadian assembly when several Reform politicians resigned from the government. George published an editorial on December 15 that was critical of the governor-general&#x27;s actions. In the subsequent weeks, &quot;Banner&quot; published editorials that disputed political accusations against Reformers and called for unity behind Liberal candidates in future elections.

In 1844, Reformers were concerned that Tories, in the upcoming election for the legislature of the Province of Canada, would appeal to the citizen&#x27;s sense of loyalty to the British monarch and thus not vote for Reformers. They wanted to establish newspapers that would publish their ideas and offered Brown £250 () to begin a new paper. In March, Brown published the first issue of &quot;The Globe&quot; as its editor and publisher. Two months later, Brown bought a rotary press, the first press of this type used in Upper Canada. This purchase increased his printer&#x27;s efficiency and allowed Brown to create a book publishing and printing office business. Although George was focused on politics, he still wrote articles for the &quot;Banner&quot; and travelled in July to Kingston to report on the Canadian Synod for the Church of Scotland. After the meeting, Brown sat on the committee of Free Kirks in Kingston who wanted to secede from the Church of Scotland. In the fall, Brown campaigned for Reform candidates in communities surrounding Toronto. In Halton, Reformers asked Brown to convince one of the three Reform candidates to end their campaign as the county would only elect two candidates and Reformers did not want to split the vote; Brown convinced Caleb Hopkins to end his campaign. Brown declined to run as a candidate because he wanted to help his father pay off his financial debts and focus on improving his newspapers. Reformers were mostly unsuccessful in the election, with many prominent members not returning to the legislature.

In the summer of 1845, Brown put his father in charge of &quot;The Globe&quot; and travelled to Southwestern Ontario to increase subscriptions to his paper. He discovered that a rival Reform newspaper called &quot;Pilot&quot; was selling copies at a lower rate and people did not want to subscribe to more than one paper. Brown appealed to Reform leaders, who convinced Francis Hincks, the editor of &quot;Pilot&quot;, to raise the cost of his paper. In October, Brown published the first edition of &quot;Western Globe&quot; in London, Canada West, which combined editorials from &quot;The Globe&quot; with local stories from the southwestern region. In 1846, Brown began publishing the &quot;Globe&quot; semi-weekly, proclaiming that he was the first Reform-newspaper in Toronto to do so.

During the 1848 Province of Canada legislative election, Hincks was in Montreal attending to business concerns and did not go to Oxford county to campaign for his re-election as the constituency&#x27;s representative. Brown spoke at the nomination meeting on Hincks&#x27;s behalf and Hincks was successfully reelected. Reformers won the majority of seats in the election to form an administration led by Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine. In July 1848 Brown and his father closed the &quot;Banner&quot; to focus on expanding &quot;The Globe&quot; and their publishing business.

In the summer of 1848, Brown was appointed by the administration to lead a Royal Commission to examine accusations of official misconduct in the Provincial Penitentiary in Portsmouth, Canada West. The commission&#x27;s report, drafted by Brown in early 1849, documented abuse within the penitentiary perpetrated by its staff members. He recommended changes in the jail&#x27;s structure such as separating juvenile, first-time, and long-term prisoners and hiring prison inspectors. While the commission was conducting its investigation, the prison&#x27;s Board of Inspectors resigned and Brown, along with Adam Fergusson and William Bristow. Although initially volunteers, Brown and Bristow were later paid for their work, becoming the first government inspectors to be employed in this role. In October 1853 &quot;The Globe&quot; started printing new issues daily and claimed that the paper had the largest circulation in British North America.

==Early political career==
===Election win and opposition member===

In 1848, Reformers won the majority of seats in the Province of Canada legislature and an administration was formed with Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine serving as co-premiers. By the following year, two factions formed among the Reformers over disagreements among secularising clergy reserves, whether the Province of Canada should be annexed by the United States, and how much influence should be given to Reformers who participated in the Upper Canada Rebellion. Brown remained aligned with the Reform party while others split off to form the Clear Grit movement. He joined the Toronto Anti-Clergy Reserves Association in May 1850 to advocate for the abolition of clergy reserves; he did not think French-Canadian reformers would support these measures, but thought that promoting this policy would prevent further Reform defections to the Clear Grits.

In April 1851, Brown ran in a byelection to represent Haldimand County in the Canadian parliament but lost to William Lyon Mackenzie. In the following session of parliament, Baldwin and Lafontaine announced their retirement from politics, and Hincks assumed leadership of the western Reform movement. Hincks renewed his rivalry with Brown, criticising the &quot;Globe&quot; for opposing state support for religious institutions. In the fall of 1851, Brown bought agricultural land in Kent county, Upper Canada, to begin work as a farmer. Later that year, Reformers in Kent county, including Alexander Mackenzie and Archibald McKellar, encouraged Brown to run in the upcoming Canadian parliament election for the constituency of Kent county. Brown accepted their offer and was nominated as a Reform candidate, even though he planned to campaign against the current Reform ministry&#x27;s state support for religious institutions. He also campaigned in support of representation by population, free trade agreements with British colonies and the United States, and the development of transportation infrastructures like rail lines and canals. Brown won the election as an independent Reform candidate, defeating Arthur Rankin, the Reformer&#x27;s ministry-approved candidate, and a Tory opponent.

Brown supported an administration led by Hincks and Augustin-Norbert Morin as successors to the Baldin-Lafontaine government, though he criticised the government for abandoning liberal ideals. Brown worked to end state support for religious institutions, opposed government funding for a religious separate school system and endorsed representation by population in the legislature. His newspaper, the &quot;Globe&quot;, still had widespread circulation and on October 1 started publishing every day as the &quot;Daily Globe&quot; to compete with other newspapers who had previously started to publish daily. Brown&#x27;s support deteriorated when scandals against Hincks were reported in the fall of 1853 and Brown toured Canada West, demanding new leadership for the Reform party. For the 1854 general election, the constituency he represented was split into two and he decided to run in Lambton, as he was not confident that he could win the other Kent constitutency. At the election&#x27;s conclusion, Hincks formed a new Liberal-Conservative administration with Allan MacNab, causing Brown to become a member of the opposition.

Brown worked with his opposition colleagues, including former Clear Grit rivals, Reformers who abandoned Hincks, and the Parti Rouge, to criticise the governing coalition. For these efforts, Brown assumed an unofficial role as one of the leaders of the opposition members. He also bought two Grit-aligned newspapers and merged their staffs to his &quot;Globe&quot; paper. In May 1855, the Canadian legislature passed a bill that allowed the creation of Roman Catholic-based separate school boards in Upper Canada. This was seen as French-Canadian encroachment into Upper Canadian matters, as the bill passed without the support of the majority of Upper Canadian parliamentarians. Brown used the event to campaign for representation by population, in which electoral districts would be divided so that each one contained a roughly equal number of electors. Brown&#x27;s pursuit of that goal of correcting what he perceived to be a great wrong to Canada West was accompanied at times by stridently critical remarks against French Canadians and the power exerted by the Catholic population of Canada East over the affairs of a predominately anglophone and Protestant Canada West. However, he did not want the dissolution of the Canadas as much of Canada West&#x27;s trade went through Canada East along the St. Lawrence River, and splitting the union would give the eastern province control over the waterway before they entered Canada West.

In 1855, Brown organised and provided the credit for the development of the town of Bothwell, in his constituency of Lambton, and set aside farmland for his own use. In 1856, John A. Macdonald accused Brown of falsifying evidence and coercing witnesses in the Royal Commission on the Kingston Provincial Penitentiary in 1848. A committee of inquiry produced a report that was non-committal of Brown&#x27;s guilt. Macdonald&#x27;s accusations and subsequent investigation caused a political rivalry to deepen between Brown and Macdonald.

===1857 election and subsequent legislature===

Brown helped organize a political convention on January 8, 1857, to unite his followers with Clear Grits and Liberals who left the Hincks administration. Brown served as one of the meeting&#x27;s &quot;joint secretaries of the local committee&quot;. This convention marked the Reform party&#x27;s transition away from a radicalism and towards a political ideology more closely aligned with the liberal ideology in Britain. The meeting adopted a new political platform for Reformer that was mostly of the political positions of Brown and his newspaper.

An election for the Parliament of the Province of Canada was held in November 1857. Brown did not want to run for the seat in Lambton because its constituency concerns took up much of his time and he wanted to focus on Reform party matters. Brown accepted the candidacy nomination for North Oxford because it would have fewer constituency affairs and, since it often elected Liberal candidates, he could campaign for other Liberal candidates elsewhere in the province. In Toronto, a petition circulated for Brown to run for one of its two seats. It was signed by groups that traditionally did not support Reform candidates, such as Orangemen, who felt that Conservative candidates were cooperating too much with French Canadians. Brown decided to run in both constituencies, focusing his attention on the Toronto campaign. Brown was elected in both constituencies, and his Reformers won the majority of seats in Canada West. His allies in the Parti Rouge were unsuccessful in Canada East and Brown returned to the legislature as an opposition member.

In the legislative session after the election, Brown served as the de facto leader of the opposition. On July 28, 1858, the cabinet of the Macdonald-Cartier administration resigned when the legislature rejected Ottawa as the new permanent capital of the province. Edmund Walker Head, the governor-general of Canada, asked Brown to form a new administration. Brown did not have a majority of support in the legislature, and he negotiated a cabinet under a co-premiership with Antoine-Aimé Dorion. Brown and the other members of his cabinet resigned their seats in parliament to run in a by-election, as was required by law. On August 2, the parliament passed an amendment stating that they did not approve of the administration, and Brown asked Head to call a general election. Head declined Brown&#x27;s request, and on August 4, Brown resigned as co-Premier. Macdonald and Cartier were able to form a new ministry with Alexander Tilloch Galt.

On August 28, Brown won the by-election that was called because of his short appointment to the cabinet during the Brown-Dorion administration. Brown toured the province, giving speeches at various Reform gatherings that denounced the Cartier-Macdonald administration. In the 1859 Toronto mayoral election, the first where the electorate would directly vote for mayor, Brown organised the Municipal Reform Association to nominate Adam Wilson as the Reformer candidate; Wilson won the election over Conservative opponents.

In 1859 Brown and other Upper Canadian Reformers organised a convention in Toronto to discuss the governance of the province, in the hopes that agreeing to a unified policy would prevent divisions within the movement on the issue. Brown favoured creating a federalist system with the province obtaining more control over its governance, as he felt this system would repel American encroachment into British North American territory west of Upper Canada and restrain his perceived Conservative corruption exampled by the administration. Brown&#x27;s speech at the convention supporting a federal government was positively received by the delegates, who passed resolutions supporting Brown&#x27;s favoured policy positions. On April 30, 1860, Brown proposed a bill in the Province of Canada&#x27;s legislature to form a convention that would discuss federalism. The bill was defeated, but the Reformer&#x27;s support for federalism was documented in the vote and Brown was able to convince the majority of Reformers to support his resolution.

Brown continued operating and investing in business ventures throughout Upper Canada. In the &quot;Globe&quot; he announced a new layout for the paper that allowed more text to be printed on each page; this was made possible by investments into new, copper-faced type. In Kent he sold some of the acres of land at his property and a cabinet factory to recover from financial difficulties, but gained a profit from his mills which sold hardwood to American lumber-dealers.

==Election defeat and marriage==

Brown became sick in 1859 and its residual effects continued into 1860, exasperated by the stress of leading the Reform faction in parliament and growing financial concerns with his businesses. Brown&#x27;s health deteriorated and in the winter of 1861, he stayed in his bed for over two months to recover, missing the entire 1861 parliamentary session. An election took place later that year, in which the Toronto Reform Association nominated Brown to be their candidate in the constituency of Toronto East. Brown struggled to campaign, with his health not fully recovered, although he returned to giving passionate speeches by the end of the campaign. He also struggled with having accomplished few of his proposed policies while he was a legislator. His Conservative opponent, John Willoughby Crawford, also campaigned on similar policies to those that Brown advocated for, stating that if elected he would be a member of the ruling party and could accomplish policies that Brown struggled with as an opposition legislator. Crawford won the election, ending Brown&#x27;s tenure as a legislator.

Although Conservative factions successfully won another majority of seats in the parliament, their position was weak and only a few votes against the government could cause it to be disbanded. Even though Brown was defeated, he was still seen as a leader of the Liberal movement in Western Canada and inquired with his Liberal eastern counterparts about forming a government should the Conservative coalition be defeated. When his inquiries were rejected, Brown used the opportunity to withdraw from public life, refusing requests to speak at rallies. In 1862 Brown&#x27;s illness was still affecting him and he decided to recover in Great Britain. He spent a month in London; while there he had a chance meeting with Tom Nelson, a schoolmate of his in Royal High School. Nelson convinced Brown to visit him in Edinburgh, where he met his sister Anne. Brown moved to a location close to the Nelson home, and began courting Anne. Five weeks after their first meeting, on November 27, they were wed at the Nelson&#x27;s home. The couple departed to Toronto just over a week later.

==Return to legislature==

With his health recovered Brown desired to return to politics, but also committed to his wife that his time in politics would be temporary and not his career, as she wanted to spend more time with him. In March 1863 the constituency of South Oxford was to hold a byelection, and Reformers selected Brown as their candidate, even though he was unfamiliar with the riding&#x27;s concerns. Brown won the by-election and returned to a leadership position within the Reform party. He won re-election during the July 1863 general election, and Reformers won the majority of seats in Canada West while Conservatives won the majority of seats in Canada East. This created a deadlock in the legislature that made governing the province difficult.

Brown proposed a select committee to investigate the sectional problems in Canada and try to find a solution, and the bill for this committee&#x27;s creation passed in spring 1864. Under his chairmanship, the committee reported on June 14 a strong preference for a new federal system of government. That same day, the MacDonald-Taché administration was dissolved. Brown stated that he would support any administration that committed to solving the deadlock in the legislature. Brown, MacDonald, Taché, and George-Étienne Cartier agreed to form an administration later called the Great Coalition to seek a federal union with the Atlantic provinces. Brown became the president of the council, a cabinet-level position, under the premiership of Taché.

==Confederation==

Brown attended the Charlottetown Conference where Canadian delegates outlined their proposal for Canadian Confederation with the Atlantic provinces. On September 5, 1864, Brown outlined the proposed constitutional structure for the union. The conference accepted the proposal in principle and Brown attended subsequent meetings in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Saint John, New Brunswick to determine the details of the union.

During the Quebec Conference, Brown argued for separate provincial and federal governments. He hoped the provincial government would remove local concerns from the federal government, which he thought were more politically divisive. He also argued for an appointed Senate because he saw upper houses as inherently conservative and believed they protected the interests of the rich. He wished to deny the Senate the legitimacy and power that naturally follow with an electoral mandate. He was also concerned that two elected legislative bodies could create a political deadlock, especially if different parties held a majority of seats in each body. The result of the Quebec Conference was the Quebec Resolutions. Brown presented the Quebec Resolutions in a speech in Toronto on November 3. Later that month, he travelled to England to begin discussions with British officials about Canadian confederation, the integration of the North West Territories into Canada, and the defence of British North America from possible American invasion.

Brown realized that satisfaction for Canada West could only be achieved with the support of the French-speaking majority of Canada East. In his speech in support of Confederation in the Legislature of the Province of Canada on February 8, 1865, he spoke glowingly of the prospects for Canada&#x27;s future, and he insisted that &quot;whether we ask for parliamentary reform for Canada alone or in union with the Maritime Provinces, the views of French Canadians must be consulted as well as ours. This scheme can be carried, and no scheme can be that has not the support of both sections of the province.&quot; Although he supported the idea of a legislative union at the Quebec Conference, Brown was eventually persuaded to favour the federal view of Confederation, which was closer to that supported by Cartier and the Bleus of Canada East, as it was the structure that would ensure that the provinces retained sufficient control over local matters to satisfy the need of the French-speaking population in Canada East for jurisdiction over matters that it considered to be essential to its survival. Brown remained a proponent of a stronger central government, with weaker constituent provincial governments.

In May and June, Brown was part of a delegation sent to London to continue discussions about confederation with British officials. The British government agreed to support Canadian confederation, defend Canada if attacked by the US, and help with establishing a new trade agreement with the US. In September, Galt and Brown represented the Province of Canada at the Confederate Trade Council, a meeting of Canadian colonies to negotiate common trade policies after the colonies&#x27; reciprocity trade agreement with the United States was terminated. During the meeting, Brown spoke with Maritime delegates to gather support for the Canadian confederation, as support for the project was decreasing in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. He supported the council&#x27;s resolution to pursue trade policies that reduced tariffs with the US. The administration for the Province of Canada disagreed and sought to increase tariffs on American goods. Brown, frustrated with his cabinet colleagues over this issue, resigned from the Great Coalition on December 19.

Brown renewed relationships with Rouge colleagues to strengthen the Reform party&#x27;s political prospects in Canada West. He lost an election in Southern Ontario for a seat in the new legislature. He determined that too many Reformers joined Macdonald and the Conservatives during the Great Coalition, and the public supported this non-partisan administration. He declined to run in safer constituencies and went on a holiday to Scotland.

==Post-parliamentary career==
In 1866, Brown bought an estate near Brantford, Upper Canada, and herded shorthorn cattle. He continued writing and editing the &quot;Globe&quot; and was consulted by Grit officials in issues concerning provincial and Canadian politics. Brown fought numerous battles with the typographical union from 1843 to 1872. He was forced to pay union wages after tense negotiations and strikes.

In 1874, Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie asked Brown to negotiate a new reciprocity treaty with the US. He negotiated with the United States Secretary of State Hamilton Fish from February until June 18, when a draft of their treaty was proposed in the US Congress. The Congress did not pass the bill into law and it was set aside when Congress adjourned four days after the treaty was proposed.

Brown was appointed to the Canadian senate in 1874 and attended his first session the following year. He supported Mackenzie when Edward Blake and the Canada First movement expressed their frustrations with Mackenzie&#x27;s leadership. His attendance in the senate was sporadic as he focused on the business affairs at his ranch. He travelled to England in February 1876 to raise capital to create a new company based on raising cattle, and obtained a charter for the new company upon his return to Canada in May. His company struggled to be financially successful and two fires in December 1879 destroyed many of the buildings on the property.

==Death==


In 1880 the &quot;Globe&quot; was also struggling financially as Brown paid for updating the newspaper&#x27;s printing press in order to produce multi-page and machine-folded papers. On March 25, 1880, a former &quot;Globe&quot; employee, George Bennett, burst into Brown&#x27;s office; he was recently fired by a foreman and wanted a certificate that showed he had worked for the paper for five years. Brown did not recognise the man, so asked him to speak with the foreman. The two men argued and Bennett pulled out a gun. Brown grabbed for the gun, but it fired a bullet into Brown&#x27;s thigh. Bennett was secured by other men and the wound was deemed minor. Brown left the office and stayed in his Toronto home to recover. His leg became infected and he obtained a fever and delirium. On May 9, 1880, Brown died in his Toronto home. Brown was buried at Toronto Necropolis. Bennett was subsequently charged and hanged.

His wife, Anne Nelson, returned to Scotland thereafter where she died in 1906. She is buried on the southern terrace of Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. The grave also commemorates George Brown. In 1885 his daughters Margaret and Catherine were two of the first women to graduate from the University of Toronto.

==Political philosophy and views==

Brown was raised as a member of the Church of Scotland. Canadian historian J. M. S. Careless described the family&#x27;s faith as further from the Calvinist interpretation of the bible and more closely followed the tenets of the evangelical movement of the 1800s. Brown advocated for a Puritan separation between politics and religion; he believed that political liberty could only be achieved if religious institutions were not involved in politics, and while he believed everyone should be Christian, he thought political institutions should not influence religion. In 1850, although he was against giving state money to religions in clergy reserves, he was willing to tolerate it in order to maintain an allegiance between the Upper Canadian Reformers and French Canadian Catholic Reformers.

Brown was against slavery and believed that the largest fault of the United States was the enslavement of people in American southern states. He was part of the Elgin Association, a group of mostly Free Kirk people that purchased land in Kent county for escaped slaves to live on. He also wrote editorials in &quot;The Globe&quot; defending a settlement of escaped slaves in Buxton from hostile white inhabitants in Kent. He was also an executive member of the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada.

Throughout the Province of Canada&#x27;s existence, Brown advocated against dissolving the union. In the 1850s he was worried that a dissolved union would cause the St Lawrence River, a major thorough way for trade, to be hampered by the two jurisdictions imposing different rules on their section of the river. When choosing how to transport their goods, farmers to the west of Upper Canada might use the Erie Canal in the United States instead (as this route would have one set of rules) and potentially setting up American annexation of those lands. Instead, Brown wanted a federal union that would have jurisdiction over joint concerns while each section would create laws for their own territory. Brown advocated for representation by population as a way to ensure the French population did not have out-sized power. He wanted to maintain the defensive and trade advantages that a unified province would have and looked to incorporate the Maritime provinces into the union.

==Legacy==

Brown&#x27;s residence, formerly called Lambton Lodge and now called George Brown House, at 186 Beverley Street, Toronto, was named a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974. It is now operated by the Ontario Heritage Trust as a conference centre and offices.

Brown also maintained an estate, Bow Park, near Brantford, Ontario. Bought in 1826, it was a cattle farm during Brown&#x27;s time and is currently a seed farm.

Toronto&#x27;s George Brown College (founded 1967) is named after him. A statue of Brown can be found on the front west lawn of Queen&#x27;s Park and another on Parliament Hill in Ottawa (sculpted by George William Hill in 1913).

He was portrayed by Peter Outerbridge in the 2011 CBC Television film &quot;John A.: Birth of a Country&quot;.

George Brown appears on a Canadian postage stamp issued on August 21, 1968.

<text>Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) also called Decentralized Artificial Intelligence is a subfield of artificial intelligence research dedicated to the development of distributed solutions for problems. DAI is closely related to and a predecessor of the field of multi-agent systems. 

Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving are the two main DAI approaches. There are numerous applications and tools.

==Definition==
Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is an approach to solving complex learning, planning, and decision-making problems. It is embarrassingly parallel, thus able to exploit large scale computation and spatial distribution of computing resources. These properties allow it to solve problems that require the processing of very large data sets. DAI systems consist of autonomous learning processing nodes (agents), that are distributed, often at a very large scale. DAI nodes can act independently, and partial solutions are integrated by communication between nodes, often asynchronously. By virtue of their scale, DAI systems are robust and elastic, and by necessity, loosely coupled. Furthermore, DAI systems are built to be adaptive to changes in the problem definition or underlying data sets due to the scale and difficulty in redeployment.

DAI systems do not require all the relevant data to be aggregated in a single location, in contrast to monolithic or centralized Artificial Intelligence systems which have tightly coupled and geographically close processing nodes. Therefore, DAI systems often operate on sub-samples or hashed impressions of very large datasets. In addition, the source dataset may change or be updated during the course of the execution of a DAI system.

==Development==
In 1975 distributed artificial intelligence emerged as a subfield of artificial intelligence that dealt with interactions of intelligent agents. Distributed artificial intelligence systems were conceived as a group of intelligent entities, called agents, that interacted by cooperation, by coexistence or by competition. DAI is categorized into multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving. In multi-agent systems the main focus is how agents coordinate their knowledge and activities. For distributed problem solving the major focus is how the problem is decomposed and the solutions are synthesized.

==Goals==
The objectives of Distributed Artificial Intelligence are to solve the reasoning, planning, learning and perception problems of artificial intelligence, especially if they require large data, by distributing the problem to autonomous processing nodes (agents). To reach the objective, DAI requires:
* A distributed system with robust and elastic computation on unreliable and failing resources that are loosely coupled
* Coordination of the actions and communication of the nodes
* Subsamples of large data sets and online machine learning

There are many reasons for wanting to distribute intelligence or cope with multi-agent systems. Mainstream problems in DAI research include the following:
* Parallel problem solving: mainly deals with how classic artificial intelligence concepts can be modified, so that multiprocessor systems and clusters of computers can be used to speed up calculation.
* Distributed problem solving (DPS): the concept of agent, autonomous entities that can communicate with each other, was developed to serve as an abstraction for developing DPS systems. See below for further details.
* Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS): a branch of DAI that builds the foundation for simulations that need to analyze not only phenomena at macro level but also at micro level, as it is in many social simulation scenarios.

==Approaches==
Two types of DAI has emerged: 
* In Multi-agent systems agents coordinate their knowledge and activities and reason about the processes of coordination. Agents are physical or virtual entities that can act, perceive its environment and communicate with other agents. The agent is autonomous and has skills to achieve goals. The agents change the state of their environment by their actions. There are a number of different coordination techniques.
* In distributed problem solving the work is divided among nodes and the knowledge is shared. The main concerns are task decomposition and synthesis of the knowledge and solutions.

DAI can apply a bottom-up approach to AI, similar to the subsumption architecture as well as the traditional top-down
approach of AI. In addition, DAI can also be a vehicle for emergence.

===Challenges===
The challenges in Distributed AI are:
# How to carry out communication and interaction of agents and which communication language or protocols should be used.
# How to ensure the coherency of agents.
# How to synthesise the results among &#x27;intelligent agents&#x27; group by formulation, description, decomposition and allocation.

==Applications and tools==
Areas where DAI have been applied are:
* Electronic commerce, e.g. for trading strategies the DAI system learns financial trading rules from subsamples of very large samples of financial data
* Networks, e.g. in telecommunications the DAI system controls the cooperative resources in a WLAN network 
* Routing, e.g. model vehicle flow in transport networks
* Scheduling, e.g. flow shop scheduling where the resource management entity ensures local optimization and cooperation for global and local consistency
* Search engines, e.g. in LLM federated search like Ithy where document retrieval and analysis are distributed to DAI agents before aggregation 
* Multi-Agent systems, e.g. artificial life, the study of simulated life
* Electric power systems, e.g. Condition Monitoring Multi-Agent System (COMMAS) applied to transformer condition monitoring, and IntelliTEAM II Automatic Restoration System
DAI integration in tools has included: 
* ECStar is a distributed rule-based learning system.

==Agents==
===Systems: Agents and multi-agents===
Notion of Agents: Agents can be described as distinct entities with standard boundaries and interfaces designed for problem solving.

Notion of Multi-Agents: Multi-Agent system is defined as a network of agents which are loosely coupled working as a single entity like society for problem solving that an individual agent cannot solve.

===Software agents===
The key concept used in DPS and MABS is the abstraction called software agents. An agent is a virtual (or physical) entity that has an understanding of its environment and acts upon it. An agent is usually able to communicate with other agents in the same system to achieve a common goal, that one agent alone could not achieve. This communication system uses an agent communication language.

A first classification that is useful is to divide agents into:
* reactive agent – A reactive agent is not much more than an automaton that receives input, processes it and produces an output.
* deliberative agent – A deliberative agent in contrast should have an internal view of its environment and is able to follow its own plans.
* hybrid agent – A hybrid agent is a mixture of reactive and deliberative, that follows its own plans, but also sometimes directly reacts to external events without deliberation.

Well-recognized agent architectures that describe how an agent is internally structured are:
* ASMO (emergence of distributed modules)
* BDI (Believe Desire Intention, a general architecture that describes how plans are made)
* InterRAP (A three-layer architecture, with a reactive, a deliberative and a social layer)
* PECS (Physics, Emotion, Cognition, Social, describes how those four parts influences the agents behavior).
* Soar (a rule-based approach)

<text>Electron density or electronic density is the measure of the probability of an electron being present at an infinitesimal element of space surrounding any given point. It is a scalar quantity depending upon three spatial variables and is typically denoted as either formula_1 or formula_2. The density is determined, through definition, by the normalised formula_3-electron wavefunction which itself depends upon formula_4 variables (formula_5 spatial and formula_3 spin coordinates). Conversely, the density determines the wave function modulo up to a phase factor, providing the formal foundation of density functional theory.

According to quantum mechanics, due to the uncertainty principle on an atomic scale the exact location of an electron cannot be predicted, only the probability of its being at a given position; therefore electrons in atoms and molecules act as if they are &quot;smeared out&quot; in space. For one-electron systems, the electron density at any point is proportional to the square magnitude of the wavefunction.

==Overview==
In molecules, regions of large electron density are usually found around the atom, and its bonds. In de-localised or conjugated systems, such as phenol, benzene and compounds such as hemoglobin and chlorophyll, the electron density is significant in an entire region, i.e., in benzene they are found above and below the planar ring. This is sometimes shown diagrammatically as a series of alternating single and double bonds. In the case of phenol and benzene, a circle inside a hexagon shows the delocalised nature of the compound. This is shown below:

In compounds with multiple ring systems which are interconnected, this is no longer accurate, so alternating single and double bonds are used. In compounds such as chlorophyll and phenol, some diagrams show a dotted or dashed line to represent the delocalization of areas where the electron density is higher next to the single bonds. Conjugated systems can sometimes represent regions where electromagnetic radiation is absorbed at different wavelengths resulting in compounds appearing coloured. In polymers, these areas are known as chromophores.

In quantum chemical calculations, the electron density, ρ(r), is a function of the coordinates r, defined so ρ(r)dr is the number of electrons in a small volume dr. For closed-shell molecules, formula_7 can be written in terms of a sum of products of basis functions, φ:
:formula_8
where P is the density matrix. Electron densities are often rendered in terms of an isosurface (an isodensity surface) with the size and shape of the surface determined by the value of the density chosen, or in terms of a percentage of total electrons enclosed.

Molecular modeling software often provides graphical images of electron density. For example, in aniline (see image at right). Graphical models, including electron density are a commonly employed tool in chemistry education. Note in the left-most image of aniline, high electron densities are associated with the carbons and nitrogen, but the hydrogens with only one proton in their nuclei, are not visible. This is the reason that X-ray diffraction has a difficult time locating hydrogen positions.

Most molecular modeling software packages allow the user to choose a value for the electron density, often called the isovalue. Some software also allows for specification of the electron density in terms of percentage of total electrons enclosed. Depending on the isovalue (typical units are electrons per cubic bohr), or the percentage of total electrons enclosed, the electron density surface can be used to locate atoms, emphasize electron densities associated with chemical bonds , or to indicate overall molecular size and shape.

Graphically, the electron density surface also serves as a canvas upon which other electronic properties can be displayed. The electrostatic potential map (the property of electrostatic potential mapped upon the electron density) provides an indicator for charge distribution in a molecule. The local ionisation potential map (the property of local ionisation potential mapped upon the electron density) provides an indicator of electrophilicity. And the LUMO map (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital mapped upon the electron density) can provide an indicatory for nucleophilicity.

== Definition ==
The electronic density corresponding to a normalised formula_3-electron wavefunction formula_10 (with formula_11 and formula_12 denoting spatial and spin variables respectively) is defined as

:formula_13

where the operator corresponding to the density observable is

:formula_14

Computing formula_15 as defined above we can simplify the expression as follows.

formula_16

In words: holding a single electron still in position formula_11 we sum over all possible arrangements of the other electrons. The factor N arises since all electrons are indistinguishable, and hence all the integrals evaluate to the same value.

In Hartree–Fock and density functional theories, the wave function is typically represented as a single Slater determinant constructed from formula_3 orbitals, formula_19, with corresponding occupations formula_20. In these situations, the density simplifies to

:formula_21

== General properties ==
From its definition, the electron density is a non-negative function integrating to the total number of electrons. Further, for a system with kinetic energy &quot;T&quot;, the density satisfies the inequalities

:formula_22

:formula_23

For finite kinetic energies, the first (stronger) inequality places the square root of the density in the Sobolev space formula_24. Together with the normalization and non-negativity this defines a space containing physically acceptable densities as

:formula_25

The second inequality places the density in the &quot;L&quot;3 space. Together with the normalization property places acceptable densities within the intersection of &quot;L&quot;1 and &quot;L&quot;3 – a superset of formula_26.

== Topology ==
The ground state electronic density of an atom is conjectured to be a monotonically decaying function of the distance from the nucleus.

=== Nuclear cusp condition ===
The electronic density displays cusps at each nucleus in a molecule as a result of the unbounded electron-nucleus Coulomb potential. This behaviour is quantified by the Kato cusp condition formulated in terms of the spherically averaged density, formula_27, about any given nucleus as

:formula_28

That is, the radial derivative of the spherically averaged density, evaluated at any nucleus, is equal to twice the density at that nucleus multiplied by the negative of the atomic number (formula_29).

=== Asymptotic behaviour ===
The nuclear cusp condition provides the near-nuclear (small formula_30) density behaviour as

:formula_31

The long-range (large formula_30) behaviour of the density is also known, taking the form

:formula_33

where I is the ionisation energy of the system.

== Response density ==
Another more-general definition of a density is the &quot;linear-response density&quot;. This is the density that when contracted
with any spin-free, one-electron operator yields the associated property defined as the derivative of the energy. For example, a dipole moment is the derivative of the energy with respect to an external magnetic field and is not the expectation value of the operator over the wavefunction. For some theories they are the same when the wavefunction is converged. The occupation numbers are not limited to the range of zero to two, and therefore sometimes even the response density can be negative in certain regions of space.

== Experiments ==
Many experimental techniques can measure electron density. For example, quantum crystallography through X-ray diffraction scanning, where X-rays of a suitable wavelength are targeted towards a sample and measurements are made over time, gives a probabilistic representation of the locations of electrons. From these positions, molecular structures, as well as accurate charge density distributions, can often be determined for crystallised systems. Quantum electrodynamics and some branches of quantum field theory also study and analyse electron superposition and other related phenomena, such as the NCI index which permits the study of non-covalent interactions using electron density. Mulliken population analysis is based on electron densities in molecules and is a way of dividing the density between atoms to give an estimate of atomic charges.

In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and deep inelastic scattering, as well as other high energy particle experiments, high energy electrons interacts with the electron cloud to give a direct representation of the electron density. TEM, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be used to probe the electron density of specific individual atoms.

== Spin density ==
Spin density is electron density applied to free radicals. It is defined as the total electron density of electrons of one spin minus the total electron density of the electrons of the other spin. One of the ways to measure it experimentally is by electron spin resonance, neutron diffraction allows direct mapping of the spin density in 3D-space.

<doc id="237636" wikidata="Q898370" url="?curid=237636" title="Conjugated system">
<text>In theoretical chemistry, a conjugated system is a system of connected p-orbitals with delocalized electrons in a molecule, which in general lowers the overall energy of the molecule and increases stability. It is conventionally represented as having alternating single and multiple bonds. Lone pairs, radicals or carbenium ions may be part of the system, which may be cyclic, acyclic, linear or mixed. The term &quot;conjugated&quot; was coined in 1899 by the German chemist Johannes Thiele.

Conjugation is the overlap of one p-orbital with another across an adjacent σ bond (in transition metals, d-orbitals can be involved).

A conjugated system has a region of overlapping p-orbitals, bridging the interjacent locations that simple diagrams illustrate as not having a π bond. They allow a delocalization of π electrons across all the adjacent aligned p-orbitals.
The π electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom, but rather to a group of atoms.

Molecules containing conjugated systems of orbitals and electrons are called conjugated molecules, which have overlapping p orbitals on three or more atoms. Some simple organic conjugated molecules are 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and allylic carbocations. The largest conjugated systems are found in graphene, graphite, conductive polymers and carbon nanotubes.

==Chemical bonding in conjugated systems==

Conjugation is possible by means of alternating single and double bonds in which each atom supplies a p orbital perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. However, that is not the only way for conjugation to take place. As long as each contiguous atom in a chain has an available p orbital, the system can be considered conjugated. For example, furan is a five-membered ring with two alternating double bonds flanking an oxygen. The oxygen has two lone pairs, one of which occupies a p orbital perpendicular to the ring on that position, thereby maintaining the conjugation of that five-membered ring by overlap with the perpendicular p orbital on each of the adjacent carbon atoms. The other lone pair remains in plane and does not participate in conjugation.

In general, any sp2 or sp-hybridized carbon or heteroatom, including ones bearing an empty orbital or lone pair orbital, can participate in conjugated systems. However lone pairs do not always participate in a conjugated system. For example, in pyridine, the nitrogen atom already participates in the conjugated system through a formal double bond with an adjacent carbon, so the lone pair remains in the plane of the ring in an sp2 hybrid orbital and does not participate in the conjugation. A requirement for conjugation is orbital overlap. Thus, the conjugated system must be planar (or nearly so). As a consequence, lone pairs which do participate in conjugated systems will occupy orbitals of pure p character instead of sp&quot;n&quot; hybrid orbitals typical for nonconjugated lone pairs.

A common model for the treatment of conjugated molecules is a composite valence bond / Hückel molecular orbital theory (VB/HMOT) treatment, in which the σ framework of the molecule is separated from the π system (or systems) of the molecule (&quot;see the article on the sigma-pi and equivalent-orbital models for this model and an alternative treatment&quot;). Although σ bonding can be treated using a delocalized approach as well, it is generally the π bonding that is being considered when delocalized bonding is invoked in the context of simple organic molecules.

&quot;Sigma (σ) framework&quot;: The σ framework is described by a strictly localized bonding scheme and consists of σ bonds formed from the interactions between sp3-, sp2-, and sp-hybridized atomic orbitals on the main group elements (and 1s atomic orbitals on hydrogen), together with localized lone pairs derived from filled, nonbonding hybrid orbitals. The interaction that results in σ bonding takes the form of head-to-head overlap of the larger lobe of each hybrid orbital (or the single spherical lobe of a hydrogen 1s orbital). Each atomic orbital contributes one electron when the orbitals overlap pairwise to form two-electron σ bonds, or two electrons when the orbital constitutes a lone pair. These localized orbitals (bonding and non-bonding) are all located in the plane of the molecule, with σ bonds mainly localized between nuclei along the internuclear axis.

&quot;Pi (π) system or systems&quot;: Orthogonal to the σ framework described above, π bonding occurs above and below the plane of the molecule where σ bonding takes place. The π system(s) of the molecule are formed by the interaction of unhybridized p atomic orbitals on atoms employing sp2- and sp-hybridization. The interaction that results in π bonding takes place between p orbitals that are adjacent by virtue of a σ bond joining the atoms and takes the form of side-to-side overlap of the two equally large lobes that make up each p orbital. Atoms that are sp3-hybridized do not have an unhybridized p orbital available for participation in π bonding and their presence necessarily terminates a π system or separates two π systems. A basis p orbital that takes part in a π system can contribute one electron (which corresponds to half of a formal &quot;double bond&quot;), two electrons (which corresponds to a delocalized &quot;lone pair&quot;), or zero electrons (which corresponds to a formally &quot;empty&quot; orbital). Bonding for π systems formed from the overlap of more than two p orbitals is handled using the Hückel approach to obtain a zeroth order (qualitative) approximation of the π symmetry molecular orbitals that result from delocalized π bonding.

This simple model for chemical bonding is successful for the description of most normal-valence molecules consisting of only s- and p-block elements, although systems that involve electron-deficient bonding, including nonclassical carbocations, lithium and boron clusters, and hypervalent centers require significant modifications in which σ bonds are also allowed to delocalize and are perhaps better treated with canonical molecular orbitals that are delocalized over the entire molecule. Likewise, d- and f-block organometallics are also inadequately described by this simple model. Bonds in strained small rings (such as cyclopropane or epoxide) are not well-described by strict σ/π separation, as bonding between atoms in the ring consists of &quot;bent bonds&quot; or &quot;banana bonds&quot; that are bowed outward and are intermediate in nature between σ and π bonds. Nevertheless, organic chemists frequently use the language of this model to rationalize the structure and reactivity of typical organic compounds.

Electrons in conjugated π systems are shared by all adjacent sp2- and sp-hybridized atoms that contribute overlapping, parallel p atomic orbitals. As such, the atoms and π-electrons involved behave as one large bonded system. These systems are often referred to &quot;&#x27;n&quot;-center &quot;k-&quot;electron π-bonds,&#x27; compactly denoted by the symbol Π, to emphasize this behavior. For example, the delocalized π electrons in acetate anion and benzene are said to be involved in Π and Π systems, respectively (&quot;see the article on three-center four-electron bonding&quot;). Generally speaking, these multi-center bonds correspond to the occupation of several molecular orbitals (MOs) with varying degrees of bonding or non-bonding character (filling of orbitals with antibonding character is uncommon). Each one is occupied by one or two electrons in accordance with the Aufbau principle and Hund&#x27;s rule. Cartoons showing overlapping p orbitals, like the one for benzene below, show the basis p atomic orbitals &quot;before&quot; they are combined to form molecular orbitals. In compliance with the Pauli exclusion principle, overlapping p orbitals &quot;do not&quot; result in the formation of one large MO containing more than two electrons.

Hückel MO theory is commonly used approach to obtain a zeroth order picture of delocalized π molecular orbitals, including the mathematical sign of the wavefunction at various parts of the molecule and the locations of nodal planes. It is particularly easy to apply for conjugated hydrocarbons and provides a reasonable approximation as long as the molecule is assumed to be planar with good overlap of p orbitals.

== Stabilization energy ==
The quantitative estimation of stabilization from conjugation is notoriously contentious and depends on the implicit assumptions that are made when comparing reference systems or reactions. The energy of stabilization is known as the resonance energy when formally defined as the difference in energy between the real chemical species and the hypothetical species featuring localized π bonding that corresponds to the most stable resonance form. This energy cannot be measured, and a precise definition accepted by most chemists will probably remain elusive. Nevertheless, some broad statements can be made. In general, stabilization is more significant for cationic systems than neutral ones. For buta-1,3-diene, a crude measure of stabilization is the activation energy for rotation of the C2-C3 bond. This places the resonance stabilization at around 6 kcal/mol. Comparison of heats of hydrogenation of 1,4-pentadiene and 1,3-pentadiene estimates a slightly more modest value of 3.5 kcal/mol. For comparison, allyl cation has a gas-phase rotation barrier of around 38 kcal/mol, a much greater penalty for loss of conjugation. Comparison of hydride ion affinities of propyl cation and allyl cation, corrected for inductive effects, results in a considerably lower estimate of the resonance energy at 20–22 kcal/mol. Nevertheless, it is clear that conjugation stabilizes allyl cation to a much greater extent than buta-1,3-diene. In contrast to the usually minor effect of neutral conjugation, aromatic stabilization can be considerable. Estimates for the resonance energy of benzene range from around 36–73 kcal/mol.

== Generalizations and related concepts ==
There are also other types of interactions that generalize the idea of interacting p orbitals in a conjugated system. The concept of &quot;hyperconjugation&quot; holds that certain σ bonds can also delocalize into a low-lying unoccupied orbital of a π system or an unoccupied p orbital. Hyperconjugation is commonly invoked to explain the stability of alkyl substituted radicals and carbocations. Hyperconjugation is less important for species in which all atoms satisfy the octet rule, but a recent computational study supports hyperconjugation as the origin of the increased stability of alkenes with a higher degree of substitution (Zaitsev&#x27;s rule).

&quot;Homoconjugation&quot; is an overlap of two π-systems separated by a non-conjugating group, such as CH2. Unambiguous examples are comparatively rare in neutral systems, due to a comparatively minor energetic benefit that is easily overridden by a variety of other factors; however, they are common in cationic systems in which a large energetic benefit can be derived from delocalization of positive charge (&quot;see the article on homoaromaticity for details.&quot;). Neutral systems generally require constrained geometries favoring interaction to produce significant degrees of homoconjugation. In the example below, the carbonyl stretching frequencies of the IR spectra of the respective compounds demonstrate homoconjugation, or lack thereof, in the neutral ground state molecules.

Due to the partial π character of formally σ bonds in a cyclopropane ring, evidence for transmission of &quot;conjugation&quot; through cyclopropanes has also been obtained.

Two appropriately aligned π systems whose ends meet at right angles can engage in spiroconjugation or in homoconjugation across the spiro atom. 
Vinylogy is the extension of a functional group through a conjugated organic bonding system, which transmits electronic effects.

==Conjugated cyclic compounds==

 Cyclic compounds can be partly or completely conjugated. Annulenes, completely conjugated monocyclic hydrocarbons, may be aromatic, nonaromatic or antiaromatic.

===Aromatic compounds===
Compounds that have a monocyclic, planar conjugated system containing (4&quot;n&quot; + 2) π-electrons for whole numbers &quot;n&quot; are aromatic and exhibit an unusual stability. The classic example benzene has a system of six π electrons, which, together with the planar ring of C–C σ bonds containing 12 electrons and radial C–H σ bonds containing six electrons, forms the thermodynamically and kinetically stable &quot;benzene ring&quot;, the common core of the benzenoid aromatic compounds. For benzene itself, there are two equivalent conjugated contributing Lewis structures (the so-called Kekulé structures) that predominate. The true electronic structure is therefore a quantum-mechanical combination (resonance hybrid) of these contributors, which results in the experimentally observed C–C bonds which are intermediate between single and double bonds and of equal strength and length. In the molecular orbital picture, the six p atomic orbitals of benzene combine to give six molecular orbitals. Three of these orbitals, which lie at lower energies than the isolated p orbital and are therefore net bonding in character (one molecular orbital is strongly bonding, while the other two are equal in energy but bonding to a lesser extent) are occupied by six electrons, while three destabilized orbitals of overall antibonding character remain unoccupied. The result is strong thermodynamic and kinetic aromatic stabilization. Both models describe rings of π electron density above and below the framework of C–C σ bonds.

===Nonaromatic and antiaromatic compounds===
Not all compounds with alternating double and single bonds are aromatic. Cyclooctatetraene, for example, possesses alternating single and double bonds. The molecule typically adopts a &quot;tub&quot; conformation. Because the p orbitals of the molecule do not align themselves well in this non-planar molecule, the π bonds are essentially isolated and not conjugated. The lack of conjugation allows the 8 π electron molecule to avoid antiaromaticity, a destabilizing effect associated with cyclic, conjugated systems containing 4&quot;n&quot; π (&quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ...) electrons. This effect is due to the placement of two electrons into two degenerate nonbonding (or nearly nonbonding) orbitals of the molecule, which, in addition to drastically reducing the thermodynamic stabilization of delocalization, would either force the molecule to take on triplet diradical character, or cause it to undergo Jahn-Teller distortion to relieve the degeneracy. This has the effect of greatly increasing the kinetic reactivity of the molecule. Because of the lack of long-range interactions, cyclooctatetraene takes on a nonplanar conformation and is nonaromatic in character, behaving as a typical alkene. In contrast, derivatives of the cyclooctatetraene dication and dianion have been found to be planar experimentally, in accord with the prediction that they are stabilized aromatic systems with 6 and 10 π electrons, respectively. Because antiaromaticity is a property that molecules try to avoid whenever possible, only a few experimentally observed species are believed to be antiaromatic. Cyclobutadiene and cyclopentadienyl cation are commonly cited as examples of antiaromatic systems. 
==In pigments==
In a conjugated pi-system, electrons are able to capture certain photons as the electrons resonate along a certain distance of p-orbitals - similar to how a radio antenna detects photons along its length. Typically, the more conjugated (longer) the pi-system is, the longer the wavelength of photon can be captured. Compounds whose molecules contain a sufficient number of conjugated bonds can absorb light in the visible region, and therefore appear colorful to the eye, usually appearing yellow or red.

Many dyes make use of conjugated electron systems to absorb visible light, giving rise to strong colors. For example, the long conjugated hydrocarbon chain in beta-carotene leads to its strong orange color. When an electron in the system absorbs a photon of light of the right wavelength, it can be promoted to a higher energy level. A simple model of the energy levels is provided by the quantum-mechanical problem of a one-dimensional particle in a box of length L, representing the movement of a π electron along a long conjugated chain of carbon atoms. In this model the lowest possible absorption energy corresponds to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). For a chain of &quot;n&quot; C=C bonds or 2&quot;n&quot; carbon atoms in the molecular ground state, there are 2&quot;n&quot; π electrons occupying &quot;n&quot; molecular orbitals, so that the energy gap is

:formula_1

Since the box length &quot;L&quot; increases approximately linearly with the number of C=C bonds &quot;n&quot;, this means that the energy Δ&quot;E&quot; of a photon absorbed in the HOMO–LUMO transition is approximately proportional to 1/&quot;n&quot;. The photon wavelength λ = &quot;hc&quot;/Δ&quot;E&quot; is then approximately proportional to &quot;n&quot;. Although this model is very approximate, λ does in general increase with &quot;n&quot; (or &quot;L&quot;) for similar molecules. For example, the HOMO–LUMO absorption wavelengths for conjugated butadiene, hexatriene and octatetraene are 217 nm, 252 nm and 304 nm respectively. However, for good numerical agreement of the particle in a box model with experiment, the single-bond/double-bond bond length alternations of the polyenes must be taken into account. Alternatively, one can use the Hückel method which is also designed to model the electronic structure of conjugated systems.

Many electronic transitions in conjugated π-systems are from a predominantly bonding molecular orbital (MO) to a predominantly antibonding MO (π to π*), but electrons from non-bonding lone pairs can also be promoted to a π-system MO (n to π*) as often happens in charge-transfer complexes. A HOMO to LUMO transition is made by an electron if it is allowed by the selection rules for electromagnetic transitions. Conjugated systems of fewer than eight conjugated double bonds absorb only in the ultraviolet region and are colorless to the human eye. With every double bond added, the system absorbs photons of longer wavelength (and lower energy), and the compound ranges from yellow to red in color. Compounds that are blue or green typically do not rely on conjugated double bonds alone.

This absorption of light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum can be quantified using ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, and forms the basis for the entire field of photochemistry.

Conjugated systems that are widely used for synthetic pigments and dyes are diazo and azo compounds and phthalocyanine compounds.

===Phthalocyanine compounds===
Conjugated systems not only have low energy excitations in the visible spectral region but they also accept or donate electrons easily. Phthalocyanines, which, like Phthalocyanine Blue BN and Phthalocyanine Green G, often contain a transition metal ion, exchange an electron with the complexed transition metal ion that easily changes its oxidation state. Pigments and dyes like these are charge-transfer complexes.
===Porphyrins and similar compounds===
Porphyrins have conjugated molecular ring systems (macrocycles) that appear in many enzymes of biological systems. As a ligand, porphyrin forms numerous complexes with metallic ions like iron in hemoglobin that colors blood red. Hemoglobin transports oxygen to the cells of our bodies. Porphyrin–metal complexes often have strong colors. A similar molecular structural ring unit called chlorin is similarly complexed with magnesium instead of iron when forming part of the most common forms of chlorophyll molecules, giving them a green color. Another similar macrocycle unit is corrin, which complexes with cobalt when forming part of cobalamin molecules, constituting Vitamin B12, which is intensely red. The corrin unit has six conjugated double bonds but is not conjugated all the way around its macrocycle ring. 
===Chromophores===
Conjugated systems form the basis of chromophores, which are light-absorbing parts of a molecule that can cause a compound to be colored. Such chromophores are often present in various organic compounds and sometimes present in polymers that are colored or glow in the dark. Chromophores often consist of a series of conjugated bonds and/or ring systems, commonly aromatic, which can include C–C, C=C, C=O, or N=N bonds.

Conjugated chromophores are found in many organic compounds including azo dyes (also artificial food additives), compounds in fruits and vegetables (lycopene and anthocyanidins), photoreceptors of the eye, and some pharmaceutical compounds such as the following:

Conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PDots) are assembled from hydrophobic fluorescent conjugated polymers, along with amphiphilic polymers to provide water solubility. Pdots are important labels for single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, based on high brightness, lack of blinking or dark fraction, and slow photobleaching.

<text>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). It conducts and funds research on brain and nervous system disorders and has a budget of just over US$2.03 billion. The mission of NINDS is &quot;to reduce the burden of neurological disease—a burden borne by every age group, every segment of society, and people all over the world&quot;. NINDS has established two major branches for research: an extramural branch that funds studies outside the NIH, and an intramural branch that funds research inside the NIH. Most of NINDS&#x27; budget goes to fund extramural research. NINDS&#x27; basic science research focuses on studies of the fundamental biology of the brain and nervous system, genetics, neurodegeneration, learning and memory, motor control, brain repair, and synapses. NINDS also funds clinical research related to diseases and disorders of the brain and nervous system, e.g. AIDS, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, and traumatic brain injury.

Established in 1950 by the U. S. Congress as the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness to help handle the casualties of World War II, NINDS grew along with the NIH. During the 1950s and 1960s, NINDS and the NIH had strong Congressional support and received significant appropriations. However, this funding declined in 1968.

==History==

=== Impetus for creation ===
The NINDS was created in 1950 to study and treat the neurological and psychiatric casualties of World War II. Many service people had returned with serious brain injuries, nerve damage, and psychological trauma. According to one estimate, &quot;neurologically disabled veterans in the postwar years accounted for about 25 percent of the patients in general hospitals and 10 percent of those in psychiatric hospitals&quot;. In addition, 1.7 million American men had been rejected for military service due to a neuropsychiatric condition or learning disorder.

NINDS was also created as part of an effort to &quot;revive the almost extinct neurological field&quot;. At the time, psychiatry and its focus on &quot;emotional tensions due to interpersonal, social, and cultural maladjustments&quot; held sway in US medicine, while neurology, with its focus on the inner workings of the brain, had fallen out of favor. During WWII, all of the administrative positions of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology held by the US armed services were filled by psychiatrists. After the war, a survey by the Veteran&#x27;s Administration of the members of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology found that 48 were neurologists and 456 were psychiatrists.

In 1948, Abe B. Baker, chair of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Minnesota, formed the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) to give young neurologists a national organization to join. However, sustained research in neurology was not possible without a national institute. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, vocal American Neurological Association (ANA) members testified before Congress, arguing that there needed to be such an institute. They articulated the arguments which had already been made on a smaller scale by citizens&#x27; groups for diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, and blindness.

Members of the research grants committee of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which had been founded in 1949, contend that they also helped provide an impetus for the new institute, as when reviewing grant applications they saw a significant number of neurological projects and proposed a separate institute for them.

=== Creation ===

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Blindness (NINDB), the original name for the NINDS, was officially established on November 22, 1950, three months after President Harry Truman signed the Omnibus Medical Research Act (Public Law 81-692) on August 15, 1950. The legislation had been passed with the efforts of Senator Claude Pepper, who was responsible for helping the majority of the NIH institutes get their start, wealthy New York entrepreneur Mary Lasker, and Fight for Sight founder Mildred Weisenfeld, who had retinitis pigmentosa.

NINDB was not conceived of entirely coherently at the beginning. For example, blindness was added because some concerned citizens raised the issue with Lasker who, in turn asked Congressman Andrew Biemiller to do so in Congress. He simply added it to the bill, being sympathetic with the cause since his mother was blind.

NINDB was &quot;responsible for conducting and supporting research and training in the 200 neurological and sensory disorders that affected 20 million individuals in the United States and were &#x27;the first cause of permanent crippling and the third cause of death.&#x27;&quot; Because the etiology of the most common neurological diseases was poorly understood, NINDB undertook both clinical and basic research on the disorders themselves and on treatments; intramural research on the structure of the brain and the nervous system itself; and, finally, extramural research on the entire field of neurology and blindness.

In the beginning, the NINDB had an Advisory Council made of six medical professional and lay people, all appointed by the U. S. Surgeon General. They formulated the path taken by the institute and granted its funds. The NINDB&#x27;s first annual budget was US$1.23 million. This came from the existing NIH budget, as Congress had not appropriated any new funds for the institute when it was created. Although the NINDB&#x27;s budget was increased to $1.99 million in 1952, there was still no money for new research programs. Moreover, the institute had neither a clinic nor a lab. As Ingrid Farreras writes in her history, &quot;The research conducted by the institute was still supported by the NIMH [National Institute of Mental Health] and the institute&#x27;s survival was unclear.&quot;

The NINDB&#x27;s first director, Pearce Bailey, was appointed on October 3, 1951, and came with experience from the Neuropsychiatry Division at Philadelphia Naval Hospital. He appointed a representative from the AAN to meet with citizens&#x27; groups and they met together to generate a unified set of demands. As a result, the National Committee for Research in Neurological Disorders (NCRND) was formed. The NCRND presented a coherent research proposal to Congress and in 1953 the NINDB received a separate line item budget of $4.5 million. The institute was now able to fund its research. However, until 1961, the NINDB and NIMH shared research facilities and scientists, often collaborating on projects.

=== 1951–1968: Strong political alliances and adding stroke ===

Bailey established the extramural grants and field investigations into retrolental fibroplasia, geographic distribution of multiple sclerosis, and projects related to mental retardation and cerebral palsy. In 1955, then U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy announced, to the organization United Cerebral Palsy, that the institute was &quot;planning to launch an all-out attack against the dread spectre of cerebral palsy&quot;. By 1959, a study to look at how gestation affected cerebral palsy had been started.

During the 1950s, Mary Lasker, Senator Lister Hill and Representative John E. Fogarty ensured continued financial support for NINDB. Together, the two Congressmen held hearings to establish the NIH budget and lobbied hard for more funds. They were assisted by Lasker, who had extensive Washington connections and was aided by Mike Gorman, a journalist and promoter of mental health. The new director of the NIH, James Shannon, a politically astute man who also had an ability to pick talented scientists, helped solidify what became &quot;the golden years of science at NIH&quot;. With Shannon, Fogarty, Hill, and Lasker working together, the NIH&#x27;s budget as a whole increased more than tenfold between 1955 and 1965. This directly benefited NINDB, as its budget rose and fell along with general budget.

Throughout the 1960s, under the directorship of Richard L. Masland, the NINDB sponsored the ground-breaking research of Carleton Gajdusek and Joseph Gibbs. Gajdusek eventually won a Nobel Prize for his work on &quot;kuru&quot; in New Guinea&quot;.&quot; The NINDB also set up clinical research centers at several universities as well as targeted research programs, such as the head injury program and the epilepsy initiative.

Stroke was added to the institute&#x27;s mandate in the 1960s and in October 1968 the institute became the &quot;National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke&quot;. Lasker was prompted to address the disease when Joseph P. Kennedy, father of then-President John F. Kennedy had one. She convinced him that a stroke commission would be a good idea and they agreed that Michael E. DeBakey would be a good director. After Kennedy was assassinated, she approached President Lyndon Johnson, who established the President&#x27;s Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke in 1964 with DeBakey at its head. The commission produced a report that resulted in a bill being passed in 1965 that established centers for the diseases across the country. In his history of the NINDS, Rowland explains that &quot;authorities later doubted that they had much lasting impact on stroke theory or therapy.&quot; This example, he notes, &quot;illustrates the tension between advocates of basic research and those who wanted immediate application&quot;. Johnson and Lasker wanted to see people benefit right away while the director of the NIH, Shannon, and other scientists were more cautious about using knowledge they did not fully understand and skeptical of the &quot;disease-of-the-month approach&quot;. They had a &quot;bedrock belief in the importance of basic science&quot;.

The political alliance that between Shannon, Lasker, Fogarty, and Hill began to splinter at the end of the 1960s. In 1967 when he wrote a 20-year history of the NIH, Shannon did not mention Lasker&#x27;s contributions. By 1968, Fogarty had died and Hill and Johnson had declined to run for reelection. With the election of Richard Nixon, the tone of research funding changed.

In general, according to Rowland, &quot;there was a feeling that vision research was not being adequately at NINDB&quot;. In 1967, a bill to create a separate eye institute was drafted, and in August 1968, federal legislation created the National Eye Institute, to build an enlarged program based on the blindness research that had been conducted by NINDB.

===1968–1980===
Starting in the late 1960s, the budget of the NIH as a whole was reduced, which affected NINDS. Training programs were cut. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s administration directed the institutes to work more aggressively on applied research and projects that would directly affect patients. Natalie Spingarn argues in her book about the politics of health research that the Nixon administration resisted scientists who did were not politically sympathetic to the president. Shannon has described the years between 1967 and 1970 as a time of &quot;progressive constraints&quot;: the budgetary process was &quot;chaotic&quot;, with &quot;Presidential vetoes, overrides by Congress, proposed recission of funds allocated, acceptance or rejection of these recissions by Congress, impoundment of appropriations, and their later release by court action&quot;. In general, increases in the NIH budget during the 1970s and 1980s often did not exceed inflation. Edward F. MacNichol, who was director of NINDS between 1968 and 1973 described his tenure as the end of a &quot;long period of NIH prosperity&quot;. Rowland writes that &quot;these years of financial insecurity may have been the most difficult time in the history of NINDS&quot;. However, he notes the achievements they made as well. For example, King Engel and his team discovered that prednisone could effectively treat myasthenia gravis and acetazolamide was shown to prevent periodic paralysis.

In March 1975 the institute was again renamed, becoming the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS).

===1980s===
In November 1988, some of NINCDS&#x27;s research was moved to the newly created National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and NINCDS was renamed the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, its current name.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, Senators Arlen Specter and Tom Harkin were responsible for pushing a large increase in the NIH budget as a whole. They doubled it in five years and subsequent years saw annual increases of 15 percent.

===2000s===
The NINDS budget passed $1 billion for the first time in fiscal 2000; the bulk of the budget is dedicated to extramural research and investigator-initiated grants (intramural research accounts for about 10 percent of the total).

==Mission==
The mission of the NINDS, as stated on their website, is &quot;to reduce the burden of neurological disease—a burden borne by every age group, every segment of society, and people all over the world&quot;. The NINDS notes that there are over 600 such disorders, with some of the common being stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and autism. In an effort to achieve their goal, the NINDS &quot;supports and conducts research, both basic and clinical, on the normal and diseased nervous system, fosters the training of investigators in the basic and clinical neurosciences, and seeks better understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders.&quot;

==Research==

===General===
&quot;Some important areas of NINDS basic research include: biology of the cells of the nervous system, brain and nervous system development, genetics of the brain, cognition and behavior, neurodegeneration, brain plasticity and repair, neural signaling, learning and memory, motor control and integration, sensory function, and neural channels, synapses, and circuits.&quot;

&quot;Some key areas of NINDS clinical research include: neurological consequences of AIDS, Alzheimer disease, brain tumors, developmental disorders, epilepsy, motor neuron diseases, muscular dystrophies, multiple sclerosis, neurogenetic disorders, pain, Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, sleep disorders, spinal cord injury, stroke, and traumatic brain injury.&quot;

&quot;Most NINDS-funded research is conducted by extramural scientists in public and private institutions, such as universities, medical schools, and hospitals. NINDS intramural scientists, working in the Institute&#x27;s laboratories, branches, and clinics, also conduct research in most of the major areas of neuroscience and on many of the most important and challenging neurological disorders. The Institute&#x27;s interests, however, are not limited to NINDS programs. The Institute collaborates with other NIH components, as well as with other federal agencies, and with voluntary, professional and commercial organizations.&quot;

===Specific===

====Javits Neuroscience Investigator Award====
The &quot;Javits Neuroscience Investigator Award&quot; (R37) was established in October 1983 to honor the late U. S. Senator Jacob K. Javits, &quot;a strong advocate for support of research in a wide variety of disorders of the brain and nervous system&quot; who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Douglas G. Stuart was an early awardee among the over 600 of these up-to-seven-year awards granted from 1984 to date

====Landis Award for Outstanding Mentorship====
The &quot;Landis Award for Outstanding Mentorship&quot; is named after former NINDS Director Dr. Story Landis.

==Structure==
===Director===
Walter J. Koroshetz, M.D. was selected director of NINDS on June 11, 2015. He began working at NINDS in 2007 as deputy director, and he served as acting director from October 2014 through June 2015.

Koroshetz received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University and his medical degree from the University of Chicago. He trained in neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), after which he did post-doctoral studies in cellular neurophysiology at MGH and at Harvard Medical School, studying mechanisms of excitoxicity and neuroprotection. Before joining NINDS, Koroshetz served as Vice Chair of the neurology service and Director of stroke and neurointensive care services at MGH. He was a professor of neurology at Harvard and led neurology resident training at MGH between 1990 and 2007.

Koroshetz has been granted many honors in his distinguished career and is an elected fellow of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Neurological Association.

===Division of Extramural Research===
The Division of Extramural Research funds programs outside of the NIH which &quot;support research, research training, and career development&quot;. The Division itself is broken down into &quot;program clusters&quot; that are &quot;organized around critical, cross-cutting scientific topics that hold great promise for advancing knowledge and reducing the burden of neurological disease&quot;. They are: Repair and Plasticity; Systems and Cognitive Neuroscience; Channels, Synapses, and Circuits; Neurogenetics; Neural Environment; and Neurodegeneration. Other working groups include: the Clinical Trials group, the Office of Minority Health and Research, the Technology Development group; and the Office of International Activities, and the Office of Training and Career Development. Within these areas, the Division tracks research and development and determines the necessity and areas for further research, analyzing and reporting on its findings to the NIH and the nation. It pursues research with other NIH institutes. Finally, it consults with and outside scientists, health organizations, and medical associational to help identify research needs and develops necessary programs to meet them.

===Division of Intramural Research===
The Division of Intramural Research is &quot;one of the largest neuroscience research centers in the world&quot;. Scientists here do research in the &quot;basic, translational, and clinical neurosciences&quot;, covering a wide range of topics, including &quot;molecular biophysics, synapses and circuits, neuronal development, integrative neuroscience, brain imaging and neurological disorders&quot;.

<doc id="237647" wikidata="Q228537" url="?curid=237647" title="Forearm">
<text>The forearm is the region of the upper limb between the elbow and the wrist. The term forearm is used in anatomy to distinguish it from the arm, a word which is used to describe the entire appendage of the upper limb, but which in anatomy, technically, means only the region of the upper arm, whereas the lower &quot;arm&quot; is called the forearm. It is homologous to the region of the leg that lies between the knee and the ankle joints, the crus.

The forearm contains two long bones, the radius and the ulna, forming the two radioulnar joints. The interosseous membrane connects these bones. Ultimately, the forearm is covered by skin, the anterior surface usually being less hairy than the posterior surface.

The forearm contains many muscles, including the flexors and extensors of the wrist, flexors and extensors of the digits, a flexor of the elbow (brachioradialis), and pronators and supinators that turn the hand to face down or upwards, respectively. In cross-section, the forearm can be divided into two fascial compartments. The posterior compartment contains the extensors of the hands, which are supplied by the radial nerve. The anterior compartment contains the flexors and is mainly supplied by the median nerve. The flexor muscles are more massive than the extensors because they work against gravity and act as anti-gravity muscles. The ulnar nerve also runs the length of the forearm.

The radial and ulnar arteries and their branches supply the blood to the forearm. These usually run on the anterior face of the radius and ulna down the whole forearm. The main superficial veins of the forearm are the cephalic, median antebrachial and the basilic vein. These veins can be used for cannularisation or venipuncture, although the cubital fossa is a preferred site for getting blood.

Proximally, the head of the radius articulates with the capitulum of the humerus and the radial notch of the ulna at the elbow. The articulation between the radius and the ulna at the elbow is known as the proximal radioulnar joint.

Distally, it articulates with the ulna again at the distal radioulnar joint. It forms part of the wrist joint by articulating with the scaphoid at its lateral aspect and with the lunate at its medial aspect.

==== Ulna ====
Proximally, the trochlear notch of the ulna articulates with the trochlea of the humerus and the radial notch articulates with the head of the radius at the elbow.

Distally it forms part of the distal radioulnar joint and also articulates with the wrist.

=== Muscles ===

* &quot;E/I&quot; refers to &quot;extrinsic&quot; or &quot;intrinsic&quot;. The intrinsic muscles of the forearm act on the forearm, meaning, across the elbow joint and the proximal and distal radioulnar joints (resulting in pronation or supination), whereas the extrinsic muscles act upon the hand and wrist. In most cases, the extrinsic anterior muscles are &quot;flexors&quot;, while the extrinsic posterior muscles are &quot;extensors&quot;.
* The brachioradialis, flexor of the forearm, is unusual in that it is located in the posterior compartment, but it is actually in the anterior portion of the forearm.
* The anconeus is considered by some as a part of the posterior compartment of the arm.

===Nerves===
:&quot;See separate nerve articles for details on divisions proximal to the elbow and distal to the wrist; see Brachial plexus for the origins of the median, radial and ulnar nerves.&quot;
*Median nerve – interior nerve of the anterior compartment (PT, FCR, PL, FDS).
**anterior interosseous nerve (supplies FPL, lat. 1/2 of FDP, PQ).
*Radial nerve – supplies muscles of the posterior compartment (ECRL, ECRB).
**Superficial branch of radial nerve
**Deep branch of radial nerve, becomes Posterior interosseus nerve and supplies muscles of the posterior compartment (ED, EDM, ECU, APL, EPB, EPL, EI).
*Ulnar nerve – supplies some medial muscles (FCU, med. 1/2 of FDP).

===Vessels===
*Brachial artery
**Radial artery
***Radial recurrent artery
***dorsal metacarpal artery
****Princeps pollicis artery
**Ulnar artery
***Anterior ulnar recurrent artery and posterior ulnar recurrent artery
***Common interosseous artery
****Posterior interosseous artery
****Anterior interosseous artery

===Other structures===
*Interosseous membrane of forearm
*Annular ligament of ulna

== Function ==
The forearm can be brought closer to the upper arm (flexed) and brought away from the upper arm (extended) due to movement at the elbow. The forearm can also be rotated so that the palm of the hand rotates inwards (pronated) and rotated back so that the palm rotates outwards (supinated) due to movement at the elbow and the distal radioulnar joint.

== Clinical significance ==

A fracture of the forearm can be classified as to whether it involves only the ulna (ulnar fracture), only the radius (radius fracture), or both radioulnar fracture.

For treatment of children with torus fractures of the forearm splinting appears to work better than casting.
Genetically determined disorders like hereditary multiple exostoses can lead to hand and forearm deformities. Hereditary multiple exostoses is due growth disturbance of the epiphyses of the radius and ulna, the two bones of the forearm.

<doc id="237649" wikidata="Q1956720" url="?curid=237649" title="Myotomy">
<text>Myotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting a muscle to relieve constriction, often performed in the gastrointestinal or urological systems. The procedure can alleviate symptoms caused by muscle-related functional obstructions, particularly in cases of achalasia, a disorder that affects the esophagus. Myotomies may be performed using open, laparoscopic, or endoscopic techniques, depending on the location and condition being treated. Common types include the Heller myotomy, used to treat esophageal achalasia, and pyloromyotomy, commonly performed in infants with pyloric stenosis.

== Indications ==
Myotomy is indicated in various conditions characterized by muscular constriction that interferes with normal physiological functions. The most common indications include:
* Achalasia – A motility disorder where the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to relax, obstructing food passage.
* Pyloric stenosis – Hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter in infants, preventing food from entering the small intestine.
* Diffuse esophageal spasm – A condition causing uncoordinated esophageal contractions, resulting in swallowing difficulties.

== Types of Myotomy ==
There are several types of myotomy procedures:
* Heller Myotomy: Commonly used for treating achalasia, Heller myotomy involves cutting the muscle layers of the LES. A minimally invasive, laparoscopic approach is preferred, often combined with a partial fundoplication to prevent gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) post-surgery.
* Pyloromyotomy: Performed to treat pyloric stenosis, particularly in infants. This procedure involves cutting the hypertrophied pyloric muscle to enable normal gastric emptying.

== Surgical Techniques ==
Myotomies can be performed using different surgical approaches:
* Laparoscopic Myotomy: A minimally invasive approach using a camera and small instruments. Laparoscopic myotomies have shorter recovery times, reduced postoperative pain, and lower chances of complications.
* Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM): Peroral endoscopic myotomy, or POEM, is a recent technique for achalasia that is entirely endoscopic, eliminating the need for external incisions. This technique is particularly useful for patients who may not tolerate traditional surgery.

== Postoperative Care and Recovery ==
Following a myotomy, patients generally experience improvement in symptoms, though the degree of recovery depends on the underlying condition and surgical approach. For example, after a Heller myotomy, patients often undergo a modified diet and may need follow-up studies such as a barium swallow to ensure effective swallowing. Gastroesophageal reflux may occur, particularly if fundoplication is not performed. Patients are typically monitored for complications, such as bleeding, infection, or mucosal tears, particularly in endoscopic procedures.

== Complications ==
While generally safe, myotomy procedures have potential complications, including:
* GERD: Common in esophageal myotomies, especially if fundoplication is not included.
* Esophageal perforation: Particularly a concern in endoscopic procedures like POEM.
* Infection and bleeding: Common issues in surgical procedures.

<text>Cheb (; ) is a town in the Karlovy Vary Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 33,000 inhabitants. It lies on the Ohře river.

Before the expulsion of Germans in 1945, the town was the centre of the German-speaking region known as Egerland. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

==Administrative division==
Cheb consists of 19 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Cheb (26,768)
*Bříza (47)
*Cetnov (104)
*Chvoječná (28)
*Dolní Dvory (49)
*Dřenice (50)
*Háje (1,082)
*Horní Dvory (57)
*Hradiště (206)
*Hrozňatov (209)
*Jindřichov (86)
*Klest (41)
*Loužek (23)
*Pelhřimov (95)
*Podhoří (142)
*Podhrad (665)
*Skalka (228)
*Střížov (172)
*Tršnice (109)
==Etymology==

The first name of the town, documented in 1061, was &quot;Egire&quot;. It was a Latin name, which was derived from the Celtic name of the Ohře River &quot;Agara&quot;. The German name &quot;Eger&quot; was then derived from the Latin name.

The Czech name &quot;Cheb&quot; first appeared in the mid-14th century. The name is derived from the old Czech word &quot;heb&quot; (modern Czech &quot;oheb, ohyb&quot;), which means &quot;bend&quot;. It is related to bends of the Ohře River.

==Geography==
Cheb is located about southwest of Karlovy Vary, on the border with Germany. The northern and western parts of the municipal territory lie in the Fichtel Mountains; the rest of the territory lies in the Cheb Basin, named after the town. The highest point is the hill Zelená hora at above sea level.

The Ohře River flows through the town. There are two large reservoirs in the municipal territory: Skalka (northeast of the town and supplied by the Ohře) and Jesenice (southeast of the town and supplied by the Wondreb). There are also several small fishponds, especially in the southern part of the municipal territory.

===Climate===
Cheb has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dclo&quot;), with average temperatures in January and February below freezing and an average temperature of in December. The average summer temperature is around , and it is not uncommon to see days with temperatures above . The town enters spring in late April and winter in early October.
==History==

The earliest settlement in the area was a Slavic gord at what is now known as the Cheb Castle complex, north of the town centre. In 807 the district of today&#x27;s Cheb was included in the new margraviate of East Franconia, which belonged at first to the Babenbergs, but from 906 to the margraves (marquis) of Vohburg.

The first written mention of Cheb is from 1061. Děpolt II founded the castle on the site of the gord around 1125. In 1149, Cheb was described as a fortified marketplace. Emperor Frederick Barbarossa acquired Cheb in 1167. In 1203, it was first referred to as a town. It became the centre of a historical region called &quot;Egerland&quot;.

From 1266 to 1276, the town was property of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. The historic town centre was established after the fire in 1270. King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia held the town in 1291–1304, then Albert I of Germany acquired the region. It wasn&#x27;t until 1322 that Cheb became a permanent part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, when King John of Bohemia acquired it from Emperor Louis IV. The later local history was marked by continued resistance against incorporation into Bohemia.

On 5 May 1389, during a Reichstag between King Wenceslaus IV and a group of Imperial Free Cities of southwest Germany, the Treaty of Eger was agreed upon, after Wenceslaus had failed to secure his interests in the town. In the 15th century, Cheb was one of the largest and wealthiest towns of Kingdom of Bohemia with 7,300 inhabitants.

The town suffered severely during the Hussite Wars, during the Swedish invasion in the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1631 and 1647, and in the War of the Austrian Succession in 1742. In 1634, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Albrecht von Wallenstein was killed here. In 1723, Cheb became a free royal town. The northern part of the old town was devastated by a large fire in 1809, and many middle-age buildings were destroyed.

In 1757, the town&#x27;s financial self-government was abolished for the sake of Austrian centralization. In 1848, the citizen&#x27;s council demanded separation from Bohemia and reconstitution of its Landtag.

The terms of the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye triggered civil unrest between the Sudeten German population and the new First Czechoslovak Republic, just as in the rest of the Sudetenland. In the interwar period, many ethnic Czechs came to the town with the boom of industry.

During the Sudeten Crisis, the town was occupied by the Nazi German-sponsored &quot;Sudetendeutsches Freikorps&quot; paramilitary group. On 3 October 1938, the town was visited by Adolf Hitler; shortly afterward Wehrmacht troops marched into the Sudetenland and seized control. From 1938 until 1945, the town was annexed to Germany and was administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. The Gestapo and &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; operated a prison in Cheb, whose prisoners were subjected to forced labour. Cheb was liberated by the 97th Infantry Division of the United States Army on 25 April 1945.

After the end of World War II the region was returned to Czechoslovakia. Under the Beneš decrees and Potsdam Agreement of the same year, the German-speaking majority was expelled.

==Demographics==
In 1910, only 0.5% of the population were Czech. Until 1945, it was part of the Northern Bavarian dialect area. After World War II, due to the expulsion of ethnic Germans and resettlement of Czechs, the population significantly dropped.

The current population includes a large group of Vietnamese people. Their families were invited to the country as guest workers during the Communist era.

==Economy==
The pillars of Cheb&#x27;s economy are mainly services and tourism, and there are no large companies here. The largest employer is the Town of Cheb. Only four industrial enterprises with 200–250 employees are based in Cheb: BWI Czech Republic (manufacturer of automobile parts), Nexans Power Accessories Czech Republic (manufacturer of components for conductors), Playmobil CZ (toys manufacturer), and Tritia (bakery).

Many entrepreneurs and small traders come from the large Vietnamese community. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, the Vietnamese community gradually established seven markets here, and even customers from Germany came to Cheb for cheap goods. Today, three Vietnamese markets operate here.

==Transport==

The D6 motorway from Prague to Karlovy Vary and Cheb (part of the European routes E48 and E49) forks in Cheb and continues to the Czech-German border to the west (as E48) and to the north (as E49).

Cheb is an important railway junction. The town lies on the railway line of national importance from Františkovy Lázně to Plzeň, Prague, Olomouc and Ostrava. Other railway lines that pass through the town are Prague–Chomutov–Cheb, Nuremberg–Cheb, Hof–Marktredwitz, Zwickau–Cheb and Cheb–Luby. In addition to the main railway station, the town is also served by the Cheb-Skalka station.

Cheb Airport is located east of the town centre. It is the second-oldest airport in the country and the oldest still existing.

==Education==
Cheb is known for its Cheb Violin Making School.

Two faculties of the University of West Bohemia, pedagogical and economic, have a detached workplace in Cheb and open study programs there.

==Sport==
The town is represented by the football club FK Hvězda Cheb. It plays in the 4th tier of the Czech football system. Its predecessor was the club FC Union Cheb, which played in the Czechoslovak and Czech First League from 1979 to 1996, but then was abolished due to financial reasons. The team play at the Lokomotiva Stadium, located on street &quot;U Stadionu&quot;. 

The Lokomotiva Stadium once held motorcycle speedway and hosted a final round of the Czechoslovak Individual Speedway Championship for three consecutive years from 1966 to 1968.

==Sights==
===Cheb Castle===
On the rock in the northwest of the historic town centre lies Cheb Castle. It was founded around 1125 and was rebuilt into a Kaiserpfalz at the end of the 12th century. It is the only example of a Kaiserpfalz in the Czech Republic. At the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries, the castle was partially rebuilt into a Baroque fortress citadel. Although the castle is mostly a ruin, the torso of the palace, the defensive Black Tower and the Chapel of Saints Martin Erhard and Ursula.

The Chapel of Saints Martin, Erhard and Ursula is a unique Romanesque-Gothic double chapel. It is the best preserved example of the Hohenstaufen architecture in Central Europe. The chapel has two storeys; the lower storey is in Romanesque style, while the upper storey is Gothic. On the first floor, there are original capitals of marble columns, decorated with figurative scenes of angels with Bibles as well as lewd scenes.

===Town square===

In the centre of the historic town centre is the Krále Jiřího z Poděbrad Square. One of the symbols of the Cheb architecture is a group of houses known as &quot;Špalíček&quot;. It is located in the middle of the town square and dates from the 13th century. The bizarre complex of eleven houses consists of narrow, four and five-storey houses without a courtyard, divided by a wide alley. They are mostly in the late Gothic style. The outline of the two blocks can still be seen on the oldest existing records of 1472.

The most valuable burgher house on the town square is the Schirdinger House. It is a Gothic house, built at the beginning of the 13th century and restored after the fire in the 15th century. The Renaissance reconstruction took place in 1622–1626. Today it houses a gallery and a café.

Among the other valuable houses on the town square is the Town House, also known as Pachelbel&#x27;s House or Juncker House. The house was first mentioned already in the 14th century. On 24 February 1634, Albrecht von Wallenstein was murdered here. Since 1873, the house serves as the town museum. The museum was later expanded to the neighbouring house.

The Grüner House on the town square is a Gothic-Baroque house. It belonged to the well-known Wrendl family from 1591 until 1876, whose family coat of arms is above the entrance. When the house was owned by magistrate councillor Grüner in the first half of the 19th century, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe frequently spent time here.

===Sacral monuments===
The Church of Saints Nicholas and Elisabeth is the main church of the town and the oldest late Gothic building. It was established as a three-naved Romanesque basilica in the 1220s, of which the western portal and the lower part of the tower remain in place. After the fire in 1270, it was rebuilt in the Gothic style, another reconstruction took place in the 1470s. After the fire of 1742, the tower was rebuilt with a Baroque cupola, according to the design of the indigenous architect Balthasar Neumann. The top of the twin steeples were destroyed by bombardment at the end of World War II and restored in summer 2008. The church tower is open to the public as a lookout lower.

The Franciscan monastery with the Church of the Annunciation was founded in 1256 and rebuilt after the fire in 1270. The church is one of the oldest Gothic hall churches in the country. Today the former monastery is owned by the town and is used as the venue of occasional concerts. The monastery also includes publicly accessible monastery garden.

The monastery of the order of Poor Clares with the Church of Saint Clare was founded at the end of the 13th century next to the Franciscan monastery. In 1707–1709, it was demolished and built again according to the design of Christoph Dientzenhofer. The monastery was abolished in 1782 and the buildings served various purposes.

The Dominican monastery with the Church of Saint Wenceslaus was built in 1294–1296. The monastery was badly damaged and the church destroyed during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The new Baroque church was built in 1674–1688. The monastery was dissolved in 1950. The church is still in use, the convent now serves cultural purposes.

The early Baroque pilgrimage complex Maria Loreto was founded in the village of Starý Hrozňatov (today just Hrozňatov). It was founded next to the Church of the Holy Spirit, which dates from 1557. It belongs to the most visited pilgrimage sites in the country. The complex was built in 1664 and extended in 1675–1683. The Stations of the Cross that leads to Maria Loreto was originally composed of twenty-nine stations.

<doc id="237658" wikidata="Q551574" url="?curid=237658" title="Maurice de Guérin">
<text>Georges-Maurice de Guérin (4 August 181019 July 1839) was a French poet. His works were imbued with a passion for nature whose intensity reached almost to worship and was enriched by pagan elements. According to Sainte-Beuve, no French poet or painter rendered &quot;the feeling for nature, the feeling for the origin of things and the sovereign principle of life&quot; as well as Guérin.

==Biography==
Descended from nobility, Maurice de Guérin was born at the château of Le Cayla in Andillac, Tarn. He was raised in a strict Roman Catholic family and educated at a religious seminary in Toulouse before attending the Collège Stanislas de Paris, where he met Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly—who became his lifelong friend.

After graduating from Collége Stanislas in 1831, Guérin decided against a traditional religious life and instead went to Brittany to enter a radical Christian socialist society founded by Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais. However, Lamennais came into conflict with the Holy See in 1833 and the society was disbanded, with Lamennais and Guérin severing their ties altogether with Christianity. Guérin then moved to Paris, where he composed his two major works, &quot;La Bacchante&quot; and &quot;Le Centaure&quot;, but became sick in 1837. He partially recovered from his illness in 1838 and in November of that year agreed to an arranged marriage with Caroline de Gervain, a noble lady of some fortune. However, he soon fell ill again and died of consumption in July 1839 at the young age of 28. None of his works had been published. He destroyed many of his poems before his death.

==Dissemination==
Guérin&#x27;s remaining works were spread between family and acquaintances all over France. His journal went with one of his friends to Louisiana and Alabama and came back to Caen, where it survived the bombings of 1944.

In 1840, a memorial of Maurice de Guérin was published in the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; by George Sand, to which she added two fragments of his writings—one a composition in prose, and the other a short poem. &quot;Reliquiae&quot;, a work which included Guérin&#x27;s &quot;Le Centaure&quot; in addition to his journal and a number of his letters and several poems, was edited by G. S. Trébutien, accompanied with a biographical and critical notice by Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve and published in 1861. A new edition, titled &quot;Journal, lettres et poèmes&quot;, followed in 1862, and an English translation of the latter was published by Leypoldt and Holt in 1867. Guérin&#x27;s sister, Eugénie, also published some of his works after his death.

<text>Owlet-nightjars are small crepuscular birds related to the nightjars and frogmouths. Most are native to New Guinea, but some species extend to Australia, the Moluccas, and New Caledonia. A flightless species from New Zealand is extinct. There is a single monotypic family Aegothelidae with the genus Aegotheles.

Owlet-nightjars are insectivores which hunt mostly in the air but sometimes on the ground; their soft plumage is a cryptic mixture of browns and paler shades, they have fairly small, weak feet (but larger and stronger than those of a frogmouth or a nightjar), a tiny bill that opens extraordinarily wide, surrounded by prominent whiskers. The wings are short, with 10 primaries and about 11 secondaries; the tail long and rounded.

==Systematics==
A comprehensive 2003 study analyzing mtDNA sequences of Cytochrome b and ATPase subunit 8 suggests that 12 living species of owlet-nightjar should be recognized, as well as another that became extinct early in the second millennium AD.

The relationship between the owlet-nightjars and the (traditional) Caprimulgiformes has long been controversial and obscure and remains so today: in the 19th century they were regarded as a subfamily of the frogmouths, and they are still generally considered to be related to the frogmouths and/or the nightjars. It appears though that they are not as closely related to either as previously thought, and that the owlet-nightjars share a more recent common ancestor with the Apodiformes. As has been suggested on occasion since morphological studies of the cranium in the 1960s, they are thus considered a distinct order, Aegotheliformes. This, the caprimulgiform lineage(s), and the Apodiformes, are postulated to form a clade called Cypselomorphae, with the owlet-nightjars and the Apodiformes forming the clade Daedalornithes.

In form and habits, however, they are very similar to both caprimulgiform group – or, at first glance, to small owls with huge eyes. The ancestors of the swifts and hummingbirds, two groups of birds which are morphologically very specialized, seem to have looked very similar to a small owlet-nightjar, possessing strong legs and a wide gape, while the legs and feet are very reduced in today&#x27;s swifts and hummingbirds, and the bill is narrow in the latter.

Owlet-nightjars are an exclusively Australasian group, but close relatives apparently thrived all over Eurasia in the late Paleogene.

A fossil proximal right tarsometatarsus (MNZ S42800) was found at the Bannockburn Formation of the Manuherikia Group near the Manuherikia River in Otago, New Zealand. Dating from the Early to Middle Miocene (Altonian, 19–16 million years ago), it seems to represent an owlet-nightjar ancestral to &quot;A. novaezealandiae&quot;. In 2022, an additional specimen from the same locality was described by Worthy &quot;et al&quot;. as a new extinct species of &quot;Aeotheles&quot;, &quot;A. zealandivetus&quot;. The holotype specimen is NMNZ S.52917, a distal right tarsometatarsus.

<text>Eugénie de Guérin (; 29 January 1805 – 31 May 1848) was a French writer and the sister of the poet Maurice de Guérin.

Her &quot;Journals&quot; (1861, Eng. trans., 1865) and her &quot;Lettres&quot; (1864, Eng. trans., 1865) indicated the possession of gifts of as rare an order as those of her brother, though of a somewhat different kind. In her case mysticism assumed a form more strictly religious, and she continued to mourn her brother&#x27;s loss of his early Catholic faith. Five years older than he, she cherished a love for him which was blended with a somewhat motherly anxiety. After his death she began the collection and publication of the scattered fragments of his writings. She died, however, before her task was completed.

<doc id="237663" wikidata="Q206874" url="?curid=237663" title="Civil list">
<text>A civil list is a list of individuals to whom money is paid by the government, typically for service to the state or as honorary pensions. It is a term especially associated with the United Kingdom, and its former colonies and dominions. It was originally defined as expenses supporting the British monarchy.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the Civil List was, until 2011, the annual grant that covered some expenses associated with the Sovereign performing their official duties, including those for staff salaries, state visits, public engagements, ceremonial functions and the upkeep of the Royal Households. The cost of transport and security for the Royal Family, together with property maintenance and other sundry expenses, were covered by separate grants from individual government departments. The Civil List was abolished under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011.

=== History===






Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the expenses relating to the support of the monarch were largely separated from the ordinary expenses of the state managed by the Exchequer. 

In 1697, Parliament under William III fixed the Crown&#x27;s peacetime revenue at £1,200,000 per year; of this about £700,000 was appropriated towards the Civil List. The sovereigns were expected to use this to defray some of the costs of running the civil government (such as the Civil Service, judges&#x27; and ambassadors&#x27; salaries) and the payment of pensions, as well as the expenses of the Royal Household and the sovereign&#x27;s personal expenses. It was from this that the term &quot;Civil List&quot; arose, to distinguish it from the statement of military and naval expenses which were funded through special taxation.

The 1760 accession of George III marked a significant change in royal finances. As his predecessor, George II, had failed to meet all of the specific costs of the civil government in accordance with the previous arrangement, it was decided by the Civil List Act 1760 that George III would surrender the hereditary revenues from the Crown Estate to Parliament for the duration of his reign, and in return Parliament would assume responsibility for most of the costs of the civil government. Parliament would continue to pay the Civil List, which would defray the expenses of the Royal Household and some of the costs of the civil government. George III, however, retained the income from the Duchy of Lancaster.

On the 1830 accession of William IV, the sum voted for the Civil List was restricted to the expenses of the Royal Household, removing any residual responsibilities associated with the cost of the civil government. This finally removed any links between the sovereign and the cost of the civil government. On the accession of Queen Victoria, the Civil List Act 1837—which reiterated the principles of the civil list system and specified all prior Acts as in force—was passed. Upon the accession of subsequent monarchs down to Queen Elizabeth II, this constitutional arrangement was confirmed, but the historical term &quot;Civil List&quot; remained even though the grant had nothing to do with the expenses of the civil government.

In 1931, George V decided to eschew the £50,000 due to him from the Civil List as a result of the Great Depression. As Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sir Frederick Ponsonby wrote to Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald to say that George had felt it was possible to reject the grant by &quot;exercise of the most rigid economy&quot; and that Queen Mary and other royal family members were &quot;desirous that reductions in these grants should be made during this time of national crisis&quot;.

===Elizabeth II===


The last British monarch to receive Civil List payments was Elizabeth II. The Civil List for her reign lasted from her accession in 1952 until its abolition in 2012. During this period the Queen, as head of state, used the Civil List to defray some of the official expenditure of the monarchy.

Only the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen Mother ever received direct funding from the Civil List. The then Prince of Wales and his immediate family (the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry) received their income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The state duties and staff of other members of the Royal Family were funded from a parliamentary annuity, the amount of which was fully refunded by the Queen to the Treasury. The Queen&#x27;s consort (Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh) received £359,000 per year. 

The last two decades of the Civil List were marked by surpluses and deficits. Surpluses in the 1991–2000 Civil List caused by low inflation and the efforts of the Queen and her staff to make the Royal Household more efficient led to the accrual of a £35.3 million reserve by late 2000. Consequently, the Civil List was fixed at £7.9 million annually in 2001, the same amount as in 1991, and remained at that level until its abolition. The reserve was then used to make up the shortfall in the Civil List during the subsequent decade. The Civil List Act 1972 allowed the Treasury to review the level of the payment every ten years, but only allowed for increases and not reductions.

The abolition of the Civil List was announced in the spending review statement to the House of Commons on 20 October 2010 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. In its place, he said, &quot;the Royal Household will receive a new Sovereign Support Grant linked to a portion of the revenue of the Crown Estate&quot;. The Crown Estate is a statutory corporation, run on commercial lines by the Crown Estate Commissioners and generates revenue for HM Treasury every year (an income surplus of £210.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2010). This income is received by the Crown and given to the state as a result of the agreement reached in 1760 that has been renewed at the beginning of each subsequent reign. The Sovereign Grant Act 2011 received royal assent on 18 October 2011. Under this Act, the Sovereign Grant now funds all of the official expenditure of the monarchy, not just the expenditure previously borne by the Civil List.

===Civil List pensions===

These are pensions traditionally granted by the Sovereign from the Civil List upon the recommendation of the First Lord of the Treasury. The Civil List Act 1837 applied the condition that any new pensions should be &quot;granted to such persons only as have just claims on the royal beneficence or who by their personal services to the Crown, or by the performance of duties to the public, or by their useful discoveries in science and attainments in literature and the arts, have merited the gracious consideration of their sovereign and the gratitude of their country.&quot; Famous recipients include William Wordsworth, William Barnes, Geraldine Jewsbury, Margaret Oliphant, Christopher Logue, and Molly Parkin. (Lord Byron is often said to have received a civil list pension, but his mother was the actual recipient.) As of 1911, a sum of £1,200 was allotted each year from the Civil List, in addition to the pensions already in force. From a Return issued in 1908, the total of Civil List pensions payable in that year amounted to £24,665. In the financial year 2012-13 the annual cost of Civil List pensions paid to 53 people was £126,293. New Civil List pensions continue to be awarded occasionally.

==Canada==

In Canada the civil list was a common term during the pre-confederation period; it referred to the payment for all officials on the government payroll. There was much controversy as to whether the list would be controlled by the governor or by the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly demanded control of all money matters, while the governors worried that if the Assembly was given this power, then certain positions would be delisted. Eventually under the Baldwin-Lafontaine government, a compromise was reached with Lord Elgin.

The term &quot;civil list&quot; is no longer commonly used to describe the payment of civil servants in Canada, who are covered in the budgets of executive agencies.

==Morocco==
Article 45 of the 2011 Amended Moroccan Constitution states that the King shall have a civil list. A similar provision was contained in Article 22 of the 1996 Amended Moroccan Constitution.

==New Zealand==

The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 (an enactment of the Parliament of the United Kingdom) granted self-government to the Colony of New Zealand and made provision for sums payable to the monarch. Various Civil List enactments were passed, repealed and replaced over the next hundred years which provided for permanent appropriations of Parliament to fund to the Governor-General, Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Members of Parliament and the judiciary. The Civil List Act 1950 provided for salaries and allowances of members of Parliament to be fixed by Order in Council on the recommendation of a royal commission, where previously they had been set at intervals by legislation, and also codified the convention that a Minister of the Crown must be a member of Parliament. It was amended in 1964 to provide for an annuity for former prime ministers and the widows of former prime ministers.

The Civil List Act 1979, succeeding the 1950 Act, was the final enactment of that name. It provided for a Higher Salaries Commission (now known as the Remuneration Authority), an independent salary-setting body for public offices including judges. A standalone Higher Salaries Commission Act 1977 extracted the commission from the Civil List Act. Some parts of the Act were also rehomed into the Constitution Act 1986. A review of the Civil List Act 1979 was undertaken by the Law Commission from 2007 to 2010; eventually the Act was repealed in two stages. The provisions relating to the Governor-General were repealed and replaced by the Governor-General Act 2010 and the remaining provisions were repealed and replaced by the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Act 2013.

==Singapore==
The Civil List and Gratuity Act provides a civil list and gratuity for the maintenance of the President of Singapore.

<doc id="237665" wikidata="Q750240" url="?curid=237665" title="Modulation (music)">
<text>In music, modulation is the change from one tonality (tonic, or tonal center) to another. This may or may not be accompanied by a change in key signature (a key change). Modulations articulate or create the structure or form of many pieces, as well as add interest. Treatment of a chord as the tonic for less than a phrase is considered tonicization.

==Requirements==
*Harmonic: quasi-tonic, modulating dominant, pivot chord
*Melodic: recognizable segment of the scale of the quasi-tonic or strategically placed leading-tone
*Metric and rhythmic: quasi-tonic and modulating dominant on metrically accented beats, prominent pivot chord

The quasi-tonic is the tonic of the new key established by the modulation. The modulating dominant is the dominant of the quasi-tonic. The pivot chord is a predominant to the modulating dominant and a chord common to both the keys of the tonic and the quasi-tonic. For example, in a modulation to the dominant, ii/V–V/V–V could be a pivot chord, modulating dominant, and quasi-tonic.

==Types==

===Common-chord modulation ===

Common-chord modulation (also known as diatonic-pivot-chord modulation) moves from the original key to the destination key (usually a closely related key) by way of a chord both keys share: &quot;Most modulations are made smoother by using one or more chords that are common to both keys.&quot; For example, G major and D major have four triad chords in common: G major, B minor, D major and E minor. This can be easily determined by a chart similar to the one below, which compares triad qualities. The I chord in G major—a G major chord—is also the IV chord in D major, so I in G major and IV in D major are aligned on the chart.

Any chord with the same root note and chord quality (major, minor, diminished) can be used as the pivot chord. Therefore, chords that are not generally found in the style of the piece (for example, major VII chords in a J. S. Bach-style chorale) are also not likely to be chosen as the pivot chord. The most common pivot chords are the predominant chords (ii and IV) in the new key. In analysis of a piece that uses this style of modulation, the common chord is labeled with its function in both the original and the destination keys, as it can be heard either way.

Where an altered chord is used as a pivot chord in either the old or new key (or both), this would be referred to as altered common chord modulation, in order to distinguish the chromaticism that would be introduced from the otherwise diatonic method.

===Enharmonic modulation===

An enharmonic modulation takes place when a chord is treated as if it were spelled enharmonically as a functional chord in the destination key, and then proceeds in the destination key. There are two main types of enharmonic modulations: dominant seventh/augmented sixth, and (fully) diminished seventh. Any dominant seventh or German sixth can be reinterpreted as the other by respelling the m7 or A6 chord tone (respectively) in order to modulate to a key a half-step away (descending or ascending); if the fifth-from-root chord tone of a German sixth is omitted, the result is an Italian sixth. A diminished seventh chord meanwhile, can be respelled in multiple other ways to form a diminished seventh chord in a key a minor third (m3 as root), tritone (d5 as root) or major sixth (d7 as root) away. Where the dominant seventh is found in all diatonic scales, the diminished seventh is found only in the harmonic scale naturally; an augmented sixth is itself an altered chord, relying on the raised fourth scale degree.

By combining the diminished seventh with a dominant seventh and/or augmented sixth, altering only one pivot note (by a half tone), it is possible to modulate quite smoothly from any key to any other in at most three chords, no matter how distant the starting and ending keys (be aware that only when modulating between key signatures featuring double-sharps/flats may the need to respell natural notes enharmonically arise); however, this may or may not require the use of altered chords (operating in the harmonic minor without an augmented sixth would not) where the effect can be less subtle than other modulations. The following are examples used to describe this in chord progressions starting from the key of D minor (these chords may instead be used in other keys as borrowed chords, such as the parallel major, or other forms of the minor):

*C–E–G–B (dim. 7th), C–E–G–B (lowering the root a semitone to a modulating dom. 7th), F–A–C (quasi-tonic) leads to F major—a relative major modulation (though not enharmonic); but exactly the same progression enharmonically C–E–G–B, C–E–G–A (Ger. aug. 6th), E–G–B–E (quasi-tonic) leads somewhat unexpectedly to E natural/harmonic minor—a half-step modulation (ascending).
*C–E–G–B (dim. 7th), A–C–E–G (lowering the 7th a semitone and respelling as a modulating dom. 7th), D–F–A (quasi-tonic) leads to the key of D major—a parallel modulation (though not enharmonic). Enharmonically: C–E–G–B, A–C–E–F (Ger. aug. 6th), C–E–G (quasi-tonic) modulates to C minor—a major seventh modulation/half-step descending.
*C–E–G–B (dim. 7th), C–E–G–B ≡ E–G–B–D (lowering the major third a half tone and respelling as a modulating dom. 7th), A–C–E (quasi-tonic) leads to A major—a minor third &quot;and&quot; relative modulation (or tritone modulation if starting in D Major).

Note that in standard voice leading practice, any type of augmented sixth chord favors a resolution to the dominant chord (see: augmented sixth chord), with the exception of the German sixth, where it is difficult to avoid incurring parallel fifths; to prevent this, a cadential six four is commonly introduced before the dominant chord (which would then typically resolve to the tonic to establish tonality in the new key), or an Italian/French sixth is used instead.

In short, lowering any note of a diminished seventh chord by a half tone leads to a dominant seventh chord (or German sixth enharmonically), the lowered note being the root of the new chord. Raising any note of a diminished seventh chord by a half tone leads to a half-diminished seventh chord, the root of which is a whole step above the raised note. This means that any diminished chord can be modulated to eight different chords by simply lowering or raising any of its notes. If also employing enharmonic respelling of the diminished seventh chord, such as that beginning the modulation in the above examples (allowing for three other possible diminished seventh chords in other keys), the versatility of this combination technique and the wide range of available options in key modulation become apparent.

This type of modulation is particularly common in Romantic music, in which chromaticism rose to prominence.

Other types of enharmonic modulation include the augmented triad (III+) and French sixth (Fr+6). Augmented triad modulation occurs in the same fashion as the diminished seventh, that is, to modulate to another augmented triad in a key: a major third (M3 as root) or minor sixth (A5 as root) away. French augmented sixth (Fr+6) modulation is achieved similarly but by respelling both notes of either the top or bottom major third (i.e. root and major third or diminished fifth and augmented sixth) enharmonically and inverting with the other major third (i.e. diminished fifth and augmented sixth becomes root and major third of the new Fr+6); either choice results in the same chord and key modulation (a tritone away), as the diminished fifth always becomes the new root.

===Common-tone modulation===

Common-tone modulation uses a sustained or repeated pitch from the old key as a bridge between it and the new key (common tone). Usually, this pitch will be held alone before the music continues in the new key. For example, a held F from a section in B major could be used to transition to F major. This is used, for example, in Schubert&#x27;s Unfinished Symphony. &quot;If all of the notes in the chord are common to both scales (major or minor), then we call it a &quot;common chord modulation&quot;. If only one or two of the notes are common, then we call it &quot;common tone modulation&quot;.&quot;

Starting from a major chord, for example G major (G–B–D), there are twelve potential goals using a common-tone modulation: G minor, G minor, B major, B major, B minor, C major, C minor, D minor, D major, E major, E major, E minor. Thus common-tone modulations are convenient for modulation by diatonic or chromatic third.

===Chromatic modulation===
A chromatic modulation is so named because it occurs at the point of a chromatic progression, one which involves the chromatic inflection of one or more notes whose letter name, thus, remains the same though altered through an accidental. Chromatic modulations are often between keys which are &quot;not&quot; closely related. A secondary dominant or other chromatically altered chord may be used to lead one voice chromatically up or down on the way to the new key. (In standard four-part chorale-style writing, this chromatic line will most often be in one voice.) For example, a chromatic modulation from C major to D minor:

In this case, the IV chord in C major (F major) would be spelled F–A–C, the V/ii chord in C major (A major) spelled A–C–E, and the ii chord in C major (D minor), D–F–A. Thus the chromaticism, C–C–D, along the three chords; this could easily be part-written so those notes all occurred in one voice. Despite the common chord (ii in C major or i in D minor), this modulation is chromatic due to this inflection.

The consonant triads for chromatic modulation are III, VI, II, iv, vii, and VII in major, and iii, vi, II, iv, ii, and vii in minor.

In the example pictured, a chromatic modulation from F major to D minor:

In this case, the V chord in F major (C major) would be spelled C–E–G, the V in D minor (A major) would be spelled A–C–E. Thus the chromaticism, C–C–D, which is here split between voices but may often easily be part-written so that all three notes occur in one voice.

The combination of chromatic modulation with enharmonic modulation in late Romantic music led to extremely complex progressions in the music of such composers as César Franck, in which two or three key shifts may occur in the space of a single bar, each phrase ends in a key harmonically remote from its beginning, and great dramatic tension is built while all sense of underlying tonality is temporarily in abeyance. Good examples are to be found in the opening of his Symphony in D minor, of which he himself said (see ) &quot;I dared much, but the next time, you will see, I will dare even more...&quot;; and his &quot;Trois Chorals&quot; for organ, especially the first and third of these, indeed fulfill that promise.

===Phrase modulation===
Phrase (also called direct, static, or abrupt) modulation is a modulation in which one phrase ends with a cadence in the original key, and the next phrase begins in the destination key without any transition material linking the two keys. This type of modulation is frequently done to a closely related key—particularly the dominant or the relative major/minor key.

An unprepared modulation is a modulation &quot;without any harmonic bridge&quot;, characteristic of impressionism.

For example:

When phrase modulation comes at or near the end of a musical piece, it is referred to as a truck driver&#x27;s gear change, especially in popular music.

===Sequential modulation===

&quot;A passage in a given key ending in a cadence might be followed by the same passage transposed (up or down) to another key,&quot; this being known as sequential modulation. Although a sequence does not have to modulate, it is also possible to modulate by way of a sequence. A sequential modulation is also called rosalia. The sequential passage will begin in the home key, and may move either diatonically or chromatically. Harmonic function is generally disregarded in a sequence, or, at least, it is far less important than the sequential motion. For this reason, a sequence may end at a point that suggests a different tonality than the home key, and the composition may continue naturally in that key.

===Chain modulation===

Distant keys may be reached sequentially through closely related keys by chain modulation, for example C to G to D or C to C minor to E major. A common technique is the addition of the minor seventh after each tonic is reached, thus turning it into a dominant seventh chord:

===Changes between parallel keys===
Since modulation is defined as a change of tonic (tonality or tonal center), the change between minor and its parallel major or the reverse is technically not a modulation but a change in mode. Major tonic harmony that concludes music in minor contains what is known as a Picardy third. Any harmony associated with the minor mode in the context of major musical passages is often referred to as a borrowed chord, which creates mode mixture.

==Common modulations ==

The most common modulations are to closely related keys (I, V, IV, vi, iii, ii). V (dominant) is the most frequent goal and, in minor, III (relative key) is also a common goal. Modulation to the dominant or the subdominant is relatively simple as they are adjacent steps on the circle of fifths. Modulations to the relative major or minor are also simple, as these keys share all pitches in common. Modulation to distantly related keys is often done smoothly through using chords in successive related keys, such as through the circle of fifths, the entirety of which may be used in either direction:

:D – A – E – B/C – F/G – C/D – G/A – D/E – A/B – F – C – G – D

If a given key were G major, the following chart could be used:
From G (which is the given key), a musician would go P5 (a perfect fifth) above G (which is D) and also P5 below G (which is C).

From this, the musician would go to G major&#x27;s relative minor which is E minor, and potentially to C major and D major&#x27;s related minor as well (a musician who does not know the related minor for C and D major may also go P5 below or above E minor).

By using the relative minor keys one can find the specific key that the key can modulate into.

Many musicians use the circle of fifths to find these keys and make similar charts to help with the modulation.

==Significance==
In certain classical music forms, a modulation can have structural significance. In sonata form, for example, a modulation separates the first subject from the second subject. Frequent changes of key characterize the development section of sonatas. Moving to the subdominant is a standard practice in the trio section of a march in a major key, while a minor march will typically move to the relative major.

Changes of key may also represent changes in mood. In many genres of music, moving from a lower key to a higher often indicates an increase in energy.

Change of key is not possible in the full chromatic or the twelve tone technique, as the modulatory space is completely filled; i.e., if every pitch is equal and ubiquitous there is nowhere else to go. Thus other differentiating methods are used, most importantly ordering and permutation. However, certain pitch formations may be used as a &quot;tonic&quot; or home area.

==Popularity==
The popularity of the key change varies with musical fashion over time. In Western popular music, from the 1960s to the 1990s, about one quarter of number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 featured a key change, but only one number-one hit in the 2010s had one.

==Other types==
Though modulation generally refers to changes of key, any parameter may be modulated, particularly in music of the 20th and 21st century. Metric modulation (known also as tempo modulation) is the most common, while timbral modulation (gradual changes in tone color), and spatial modulation (changing the location from which sound occurs) are also used.

Modulation may also occur from a single tonality to a polytonality, often by beginning with a duplicated tonic chord and modulating the chords in contrary motion until the desired polytonality is reached.

<doc id="237667" wikidata="Q355112" url="?curid=237667" title="Louis Blanc">
<text>Louis Jean Joseph Charles Blanc ( ; ; 29 October 1811 – 6 December 1882) was a French socialist politician, journalist and historian. He called for the creation of cooperatives in order to guarantee employment for the urban poor. Although Blanc&#x27;s ideas of the workers&#x27; cooperatives were never realized, his political and social ideas greatly contributed to the development of socialism in France. He wanted the government to encourage cooperatives and replace capitalist enterprises. These cooperatives were to be associations of people who produced together and divided the profit accordingly.

Following the Revolution of 1848, Blanc became a member of the provisional government and began advocating for cooperatives which would be initially aided by the government but ultimately controlled by the workers themselves. Blanc&#x27;s advocacy failed; caught between radical worker tendencies and the National Guard, he was forced into exile. Blanc returned to France in 1870, shortly before the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War, where he served as a member of the National Assembly for Seine. While he did not support the Paris Commune, he successfully proposed amnesty to the Communards.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Blanc was born in Madrid. His father held the post of Inspector General of Finance under Joseph Bonaparte. His younger brother was Charles Blanc, who later became an influential art critic. Failing to receive aid from Pozzo di Borgo, his mother&#x27;s uncle, Louis Blanc studied law in Paris, living in poverty, and became a contributor to various journals. In the &quot;Revue du progres&quot;, which he founded, he published in 1839 his study on &quot;L&#x27;Organisation du travail&quot;. The principles laid down in this famous essay form the key to Louis Blanc&#x27;s whole political career. He attributes all the evils that afflict society to the pressure of competition, whereby the weaker are driven to the wall. He demanded the equalization of wages, and the merging of personal interests in the common good—&quot;,&quot; which is often translated as &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.&quot; This was to be affected by the establishment of &quot;social workshops,&quot; a sort of combined co-operative society and trade union, where the workmen in each trade were to unite their efforts for their common benefit. In 1841 he published his , an attack upon the July Monarchy. It ran through four editions in four years.

=== Revolution of 1848 ===
In 1847, Blanc published the two first volumes of his . Its publication was interrupted by the Revolution of 1848, when he became a member of the provisional government. It was on his motion that, on 25 February, the government undertook &quot;to guarantee the existence of the workmen by work&quot;; and though his demand for the establishment of a ministry of labour was refused as beyond the competence of a provisional government, he was appointed to preside over the government labour commission () established at the Luxembourg Palace to inquire into and report on the labour question.

The revolution of 1848 was the real chance for Louis Blanc&#x27;s ideas to be implemented. His theory of using the established government to enact change was different from those of other socialist theorists of his time. Blanc believed that workers could control their own livelihoods but knew that unless they were given help to get started the cooperative workshops would never work. To assist this process along Blanc lobbied for national funding of these workshops until the workers could assume control. To fund this ambitious project, Blanc saw a ready revenue source in the rail system. Under government control the railway system would provide the bulk of the funding needed for this and other projects Blanc saw in the future.

When the workshop program was ratified in the National Assembly, Blanc&#x27;s chief rival was put in control of the project. The National Assembly was not ready for this type of social program and treated the workshops as a method of buying time until the assembly could gather enough support to stabilize themselves against another worker rebellion. Thomas&#x27;s deliberate failure in organizing the workshops into a success only seemed to anger the public more. The people had been promised a job and a working environment in which the workers were in charge, from these government-funded programs. What they had received was hand outs and government funded work parties to dig ditches and hard manual labor for meager wages or paid to remain idle. When the workshops were closed the workers rebelled again but were put down by force by the National Guard. The National Assembly was also able to blame Blanc for the failure of the workshops. His ideas were questioned, and he lost much of the respect which had given him influence with the public.

Between the sans-culottes, who tried to force him to place himself at their head, and the National Guards, who mistreated him, he was nearly killed. Rescued with difficulty, he escaped with a false passport to Belgium, and then to London. He was condemned to deportation in absentia by a special tribunal at Bourges. He protested against the trial and sentence in a series of articles in the , a review published in Paris under his direction. These he afterwards collected and published as (Brussels, 1850).

=== Exile ===
During his stay in Britain, he made use of the unique collection of materials for the revolutionary period preserved at the British Museum to complete his (12 vols., 1847–1862). In 1858 he published a reply to Lord Normanby&#x27;s &quot;A Year of Revolution in Paris&quot; (1858), which he developed later into his (2 vols., 1870–1880). He was also active in the masonic organisation, the Conseil Suprême de l&#x27;Ordre Maçonnique de Memphis. His membership in the London-based La Grand Loge des Philadelphes is unconfirmed.

=== Return to France ===

As far back as 1839, Louis Blanc had vehemently opposed the idea of a Napoleonic restoration, predicting that it would be &quot;despotism without glory,&quot; &quot;the Empire without the Emperor.&quot; He therefore remained in exile until the fall of the Second Empire in September 1870, after which he returned to Paris and served as a private in the National Guard. On 8 February 1871 he was elected a member of the National Assembly, in which he maintained that the Republic was &quot;the necessary form of national sovereignty,&quot; and voted for the continuation of the war; yet, though a leftist, he did not sympathize with the Paris Commune and exerted his influence in vain on the side of moderation. In 1878 he advocated the abolition of the presidency and the Senate. In January 1879 he introduced into the chamber a proposal for the amnesty of the Communards, which was carried. This was his last important act. His declining years were darkened by ill-health and by the death, in 1876, of his wife Christina Groh, whom he had married in 1865. He died at Cannes, and on 12 December received a state funeral in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

=== Legacy ===
Blanc possessed a picturesque and vivid style, and considerable power of research; but the fervour with which he expressed his convictions, while placing him in the first rank of orators, tended to turn his historical writings into political pamphlets. His political and social ideas have had a great influence on the development of socialism in France. His (1847–1881) was published in 1882. His most important works, besides those already mentioned, are (1866–1867), (1879–1881), and (1873–1884).

The Paris Metro Station Louis Blanc is named after him.

==== Capitalism ====
Blanc is sometimes cited as the first person to use the word capitalism in something like its modern form. While he did not mean the economic system described by Karl Marx in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, Blanc sowed the seeds of that usage, coining the word to mean the holding of capital away from others:
== Thought ==
=== Reformist socialism ===
Blanc was unusual in advocating for socialism without revolution first.

=== Right to work ===
Blanc invented the right to work with his .

=== Religion ===
Blanc resisted what he perceived as the atheism implicit in Hegel, claiming that it corresponded to anarchism in politics and was not an adequate basis for democracy. Friedrich Engels claimed that &quot;Parisian reformers of the Louis Blanc trend&quot; could only imagine atheists as monsters.

Instead, Blanc claimed that religion was foundational for revolution to take place, in keeping with the romantic tradition. He regarded liberalism and Protestantism as part of the same historical and ideological movement and accordingly considered the French Revolution of 1789 as a political outgrowth of the individualistic rejection of authority inherent in Protestantism and heretical movements. Blanc thought the best of the revolution was the Jacobin dictatorship in the communitarian spirit of Catholicism. Blanc himself sought to combine Catholicism and Protestantism in order to synthesize the values of authority, community, and individualism that he both affirmed as necessary for community. He was unusual in combining Catholicism and socialism.

Along with Etienne Cabet, Blanc advocated for what he understood as true Christianity while simultaneously critiquing the religion of Catholic clergy. He was hopeful about the religious innovation taking place in early revolutionary France. His belief in God was shaped by romanticism and was similar to Rousseau, Philippe Buchez and François-Vincent Raspail.

<text>Shpongle is a psychedelic electronic music project from England that formed in 1996. The group includes Simon Posford and Raja Ram (one of three in The Infinity Project). The duo are considered to be one of the progenitors of the psybient genre — a genre combining world music with psychedelic trance and ambient. Their musical style combines traditional music from all over the world and vocals with contemporary western synthesizer-based psychedelic music. When asked to describe Shpongle&#x27;s music, Posford has responded that it is &quot;like nothing you&#x27;ve ever heard before.&quot;

Shpongle&#x27;s first track, &quot;Vapour Rumours&quot;, was released on TIP Records&#x27; &quot;Infinite Excursions&quot; compilation in 1996. Their debut album, &quot;Are You Shpongled?&quot;, was released in 1998 on Twisted Records. On 9 September 2014, Posford confirmed beginning work on a sixth album, which was released as &quot;Codex VI&quot; on 23 October 2017. On 3 October 2017, even before the release of &quot;Codex VI&quot;, the duo announced via a Facebook video that they have begun working on their seventh studio album. Since 30 June 2017, the duo have also been releasing remasters of their previous albums, focussing on releasing special edition vinyl records.

Posford is generally responsible for the synthesizers, studio work, and live instrumentation, while Raja Ram contributes broad musical concepts and flute arrangements. Raja Ram stated in an interview that &quot;Shpongle&quot; is an umbrella term for feeling positive and euphoric emotions. Shpongle&#x27;s music is heavily influenced by psychedelic experiences and frequently makes use of sonic textures that approximate psychedelic states as well as vocal samples relating to consciousness expansion, hallucinations, and altered states of awareness. For example, the track &quot;A New Way to Say &#x27;Hooray&#x27;&quot; contains a vocal sample of Terence McKenna describing the effects of DMT.

==Shpongle live==
Shpongle has played several live concerts, and Simon Posford tours frequently, performing live DJ sets. Raja Ram has occasionally accompanied these sets with live flute performances. Shpongle&#x27;s first live performance was at the Solstice Music Festival at Motosu Highland in Japan in July 2001. They returned to Japan on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2003 to play the New Maps of Hyperspace event at Tokyo Bay NK Hall together with 1200 Micrograms (featuring Raja Ram) and Hallucinogen.

Prior to the release of their fourth album Shpongle played a sold out live concert at The Roundhouse venue in Chalk Farm, North London on 31 October 2008. The band featured Andy Gangadeen (drums), Nogera (percussion), Chris Taylor (bass), Pete Callard (guitar), Harry Escott (cello), and Dick Trevor (keyboards and programming); Michele Adamson and Hari Om (voices), three dancers, and for one song only (&quot;Nothing is Something Worth Doing&quot;) Manu Delago on hand pan.

This was followed on 20 December 2008 by a concert in Moscow featuring the same lineup. Shows were also planned for 7 and 9 March 2009 in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, but these were cancelled due to non-payment of the deposit by the promoters.
In 2009, Shpongle played a headlining date at the Ozora Festival held near Ozora, Hungary on 15 August; Shpongle also played a latenight DJ set at Rothbury Festival in Rothbury, Michigan over Fourth of July weekend and two album launch shows at the Roundhouse on 30 and 31 October. The duo returned to Moscow to play at Milk on 12 December 2009.

On 3 August 2010, they opened the Ozora festival in Hungary. This was their tenth documented live performance.

In January 2011, Shpongle toured Australia, playing dates at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne, the Enmore Theatre in Sydney, and headlining the Rainbow Serpent Festival in Victoria, Australia.
In June 2011, Shpongle played at the Electric Forest Festival with the Shpongletron.

New unreleased material from the forthcoming album was incorporated in the 2011 tour, the Shpongletron Experience. The tour featured the Shpongletron, designed by visual artist Zebbler. The Shpongletron included a DJ booth and multiple custom-made, video-mapped projection surfaces.

&quot;Shpongle Live&quot; performed at Camp Bisco X on 8 July 2011 in Mariaville, New York. This was Shpongle&#x27;s first ever performance as a full ensemble in the United States and was greatly received by fans and newcomers alike. The band also performed two sold-out American shows on Halloween weekend in 2011, playing at the Hammerstein Ballroom in 
New York City on 28 October, and at the Fox Oakland Theater in Oakland, California on 29 October. They debuted the first track from &quot;Museum of Consciousness&quot;, called &quot;Brain in a Fish Tank,&quot; on 28 October 2011.

For 2012, Shpongle toured the United States performing DJ sets entitled &quot;Shpongle presents The Masquerade&quot;. The last set of this tour was performed on 31 October 2012, at Terminal West in Atlanta, Georgia. On 3 November, they performed with Younger Brother, Hallucinogen, and other Twisted Records artists. Their set included live keyboards and flute, and debuted many new tracks from their most recent album.

After the ceremony in 2010, on 6 August 2013 Shpongle is once again opening O.Z.O.R.A. Festival with a world premier concert for their new material called &quot;Museum of Consciousness&quot; (2013).

Oct. 2013 full band live in London at the Troxy. The show was filmed and is available on DVD, released in 2015.

Shpongle played live with a full 12 piece band at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado, on 10 May 2014. The concert was filmed, and released on 23 October 2015 as Shpongle - Live at Red Rocks.

On 19 November 2014, it was announced via social media that Shpongle would once again begin touring in the United States throughout early 2015, featuring Phutureprimitive as special guest, the return of &quot;Shpongletron 3.1,&quot; and with visuals by Zebbler.

On 21 September 2018, Shpongle announced their last full public concerts, two consecutive nights at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on 3/4 May 2019:

Although this is their last full public concert, Shpongle will continue to enchant and delight with future studio recordings and album releases, with some Shpongle 7 productions receiving their world premieres at this performance.

<doc id="237671" wikidata="Q510334" url="?curid=237671" title="Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo">
<text>Count Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo (, , &quot;Karl Osipovich Potso di Borgo&quot;; 8 March 1764 – 15 February 1842) was a Corsican politician, who later became a Russian diplomat.

He was an official representative of his homeland in Paris before entering the Russian diplomatic service. His life was dominated by opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte, driven by a life-long hatred of him from an early age, considering him a traitor.

==Biography==
===Early life and politics===
He was born at Alata, near Ajaccio, the son of Giuseppe Pozzo di Borgo of a noble Corsican family, four years before the island became a French possession. He was educated at Pisa, and in early life was closely associated with Napoleon and Joseph Bonaparte, the two families at that time being close political allies. Pozzo was one of two delegates sent to the National Assembly in Paris to demand the political incorporation of Corsica into France, and was subsequently one of the Corsican deputies to the Legislative Assembly, where he sat on the benches of the right until the events of August 1792.

===Chief Minister of Corsica===
On his safe return to Corsica, he was warmly received by Pasquale Paoli, but found himself in opposition to the Bonaparte brothers who belonged to a different Corsican clan (and one he detested) who were now veering towards the Jacobin party. Under the new constitution, Pozzo was elected procureur-general-syndic, that is, chief of the civil government, while Paoli commanded the army. Along with Paoli, he refused to obey a summons to the bar of the convention, and the final breach with the Bonapartes, who actively supported the revolutionary authorities, dates from this time. Eventually, Paoli and Pozzo accepted foreign help, and from 1794 to 1796, during the British protectorate of Corsica, Pozzo was president of the council of state under Sir Gilbert Eliott.

When Napoleon sent troops to occupy the island Pozzo was excepted from the general amnesty, and took refuge in Rome, but the French authorities demanded his expulsion, and gave orders for his arrest in northern Italy. After a short stay in London he accompanied in 1798 Sir Gilbert (now Gilbert Eliott, 1st Earl of Minto) on an embassy to Vienna, where he lived for six years and was well received in political circles. His hatred of Napoleon dominated his life, and even as an exile of no official standing he was recognized as a dangerous enemy.

===Serving the Russian Empire===
In 1804 through the influence of Prince Adam Czartoryski he entered the Russian diplomatic service, and was sent on his first diplomatic mission in September 1805 to Vienna and Napoli, where he helped maintain the Austrian-Russian alliance after the defeat at Austerlitz. He was subsequently sent as envoy to the Anglo-Neapolitan forces, and in 1806 to the Prussian army. He was entrusted with an important mission to Constantinople in 1807, but the conclusion of the alliance between Tsar Alexander I of Russia and Napoleon at Tilsit in July interrupted his career, necessitating a temporary retirement after the completion of his business with the Porte.

He returned to Vienna, but on the demand of Napoleon for his extradition Metternich asked him to leave the capital; he left to London, where he found safety from Napoleon in one of the few countries outside the control of Paris. He renewed many old ties, and had an affair with the noted society beauty Emily Lamb, Countess Cowper, and may have fathered one or more of her children. He remained in England until 1812, when he was recalled by Tsar Alexander to service in Russia. He diligently sought to sow dissension in the Bonaparte household, and in a mission to Sweden he helped secure the cooperation of Bernadotte against Napoleon. On the entry of the allies into Paris he became commissary general to the provisional government. At the Bourbon restoration General Pozzo di Borgo became Russian ambassador at the Tuileries, and sought to secure a marriage between Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, and the Russian grand duchess Anna, Alexander&#x27;s sister.

===Diplomat during Restoration===
Pozzo assisted at the Congress of Vienna, and during the Hundred Days he joined Louis XVIII in Belgium, where he was also instructed to discuss the situation with the Duke of Wellington. He was present at Waterloo and was singled out by The Duke of Wellington in his post-battle dispatch. The Tsar dreamed of allowing an appeal to the people of France on the subject of the government of France in accordance with his vague liberalizing tendencies, but Pozzo&#x27;s suggestions in this direction were met by violent opposition, the Duke refusing to make any concessions to what he regarded as rebellion; but in St. Petersburg, on the other hand, his attachment to the Bourbon dynasty was considered excessive.

During the early years of his residence in Paris Pozzo laboured tirelessly to lessen the burdens laid on France by the allies and to shorten the period of foreign occupation. That his French sympathies were recognized in Paris is shown by the strange suggestion that he should enter the French ministry with the portfolio of foreign affairs. He consistently supported the moderate party at court, and stood by the ministry of the Duc de Richelieu, thus earning the distrust and dislike of Metternich, who held him responsible for the revival of Liberal agitation in France. His influence at the Tuileries declined with the accession of Charles X, whose reactionary tendencies had always been distasteful to him; but at the revolution of 1830, when Tsar Nicholas was reluctant to acknowledge Louis Philippe, he did good service in preventing difficulties with Russia.

===Later life and death===
In 1832 he visited St Petersburg; the next year he was in London renewing its relations with Wellington, and early in 1835 he was suddenly transferred to the London embassy in succession to Prince Lieven. Although he did not lose in official standing, Pozzo was aware that this change was due to suspicions long harboured in various quarters in St Petersburg that his diplomacy was too favourable to French interests. He complained that the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, treated him with appalling rudeness, once keeping him waiting for two hours; the fact that he had once been the lover of Lady Cowper, Palmerston&#x27;s mistress, cannot have made for friendly relations between the two men. In London his health suffered, and he retired from the service in 1839 to spend the rest of his days in Paris. He had been made a count and peer of France in 1818.

He was played by Norman Shelley in the British historical drama &quot;The Iron Duke&quot; (1934). He was also the subject of a semi-documentary US film in 1942 called &quot;Vendetta&quot;, part of The Passing Parade series. The film served as wartime propaganda which equated di Borgo&#x27;s service in the defeat of Napoleon to that necessary for the defeat of Adolf Hitler.

<text>Terrazzo is a composite material, poured in place or precast, which is used for floor and wall treatments. It consists of chips of marble, quartz, granite, glass, or other suitable material, poured with a cementitious binder (for chemical binding), polymeric (for physical binding), or a combination of both. Metal strips often divide sections, or changes in color or material in a pattern. Additional chips may be sprinkled atop the mix before it sets. After it is cured it is ground and polished smooth or otherwise finished to produce a uniformly textured surface. &quot;Terrazzo&quot; is also often used to describe any pattern similar to the original terrazzo floors.
Modern forms of terrazzo include polished concrete.

==History==
===Terrazzo proper===
Although the history of terrazzo can be traced back to the ancient mosaics of Egypt, its more recent predecessors come from Italy. The form of terrazzo used today derives partly from the 18th century &quot;pavimento alla Veneziana&quot; (Venetian pavement) and the cheaper &quot;seminato.&quot; &quot;Pavimento alla Veneziana&quot; had workers place marble fragments next to each other in a mortar base. Terrazzo is also related to the technique &quot;seminato&quot; for which workers tossed larger marble chips into the cement that was then ground and polished. Together, these methods create the generic form of terrazzo that involves pieces of stone that are bonded to a cement bed. Terrazzo was first introduced in the United States in the late 1890s, but did not achieve popularity until the 1920s. Until then it was hand polished with a long handled tool called a &quot;galera&quot;. Due to its likelihood of cracking, terrazzo was used at a small scale in comparison to the large expanses we see today. Two inventions resulted in its rise in popularity: divider strips and the electric grinding machine. The invention of divider strips by L. Del Turco and Bros. in 1924 contained the cracking of terrazzo by allowing the material greater space to expand and shrink after installation. This invention made terrazzo a durable and reliable material in addition to allowing for further design work within the floor. Installers use the dividing strips as guides when they work with different colored terrazzo. Additionally, the electric grinding machine and mechanization of the production process cut down on costs and installation time, making terrazzo an affordable flooring option.

Art Deco and Moderne styles from the 1920s to 1940s favored terrazzo with the dividers allowing for straight or curved lines that increased the decorative potential. The popularity of terrazzo led to an increase in installers in the 1920s. The National Terrazzo and Mosaic Organization was formed in 1931 to further professionalize the practice of terrazzo installation. One of the best-known examples of terrazzo is the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Created in 1958, the walk honors celebrities in the form of a terrazzo star that displays their name.

===Archaeological use of the term===
Archaeologists have adopted the term &quot;terrazzo&quot; to describe the floors of early Neolithic buildings (PPNA and PPNB, ca. 9,000–8,000 BC) in Western Asia constructed of burnt lime and clay, colored red with ochre and polished. The embedded crushed limestone gives it a slightly mottled appearance. The use of fire to produce burnt lime, which was also used for the hafting of implements, predates production of fired pottery by almost a thousand years. In the early Neolithic settlement of Çayönü in eastern Turkey about of terrazzo floors have been uncovered. The floors of the PPN B settlement of Nevalı Çori measure about . They are thick, and contain about 10–15% lime.

These floors are almost impenetrable to moisture and very durable, but their construction involved a high input of energy. Gourdin and Kingery (1975) estimate that the production of any given amount of lime requires about five times that amount of wood. Recent experiments by Affonso and Pernicka have shown that only twice the amount is needed, but that would still amount to 4.5 metric tonnes of dry wood for the floors in Çayönü. Other sites with terrazzo floors include Nevalı Çori, Göbekli Tepe, Jericho, and Kastros (Cyprus).

== Production ==

Terrazzo artisans create walls, floors, patios, and panels by exposing marble chips and other fine aggregates on the surface of finished concrete or epoxy-resin. Much of the preliminary work of terrazzo workers is similar to that of cement masons. Marble-chip, cementitious terrazzo requires three layers of materials. First, cement masons or terrazzo workers build a solid, level concrete foundation that is deep. After the forms are removed from the foundation, workers add a layer of sandy concrete. Before this layer sets, terrazzo workers partially embed metal divider strips in the concrete wherever there is to be a joint or change of color in the terrazzo. For the final layer, terrazzo workers blend and place into each of the panels a fine marble chip mixture that may be color-pigmented. While the mixture is still wet, workers toss additional marble chips of various colors into each panel and roll a weighted roller () over the entire surface.

In the 1970s, polymer-based terrazzo was introduced and is called thin-set terrazzo. Initially polyester and vinyl ester resins were used as the binder resin. Today, most of the terrazzo installed is epoxy terrazzo. The advantages of this material over cementitious terrazzo include a wider selection of colors, installation thickness, lighter weight, faster installation, impermeable finish, higher strength, and less susceptibility to cracking. The disadvantage of epoxy resin–based terrazzo is that it can only be used for interior, not exterior, applications. Epoxy-based terrazzo will lose its color and slightly peel when used outdoors, whereas cement-based terrazzo will not. In addition to marble aggregate blends, other aggregates have been used, such as mother of pearl and abalone shell. Recycled aggregates include: glass, porcelain, concrete, and metal. Shapes and medallions can be fabricated on site by bending divider strips, or off site by water-jet cutting.

When the terrazzo is thoroughly cured, helpers grind it with a terrazzo grinder, which is somewhat like a floor polisher, only much heavier. Slight depressions left by the grinding are filled with a matching grout material and hand-troweled for a smooth, uniform surface; it is then cleaned, polished, and sealed.

=== Types and systems ===

Terrazzo installation includes both bonded and unbonded methods. Bonded systems include: bonded underbed, monolithic, chemically bonded, and the most recent, thin set method (epoxy resin). Bonded terrazzo is applied over a sand-cement mortar underbed which sits on top of a concrete slab. The sand-cement layer allows for variations in the finished concrete slab that it sits on. Monolithic terrazzo is applied directly over an extremely flat and high quality concrete sub-floor. Thin-set terrazzo does not require a concrete sub-floor. Instead, a flexible membrane can be installed so that cracks do not appear on the surface. Unbonded includes the sand cushion method which uses wire reinforcing, an isolation sheet, and sand dusting that absorbs any movement from the concrete slab.

=== Relation to mosaics ===
Although terrazzo derives from the mosaic artform, it does not necessarily place individual pieces in a decorative pattern. Instead, small pieces are thrown into the mortar base creating a more uniform surface appearance. Decorative patterns are often created by using dividers which creates lines between different colored terrazzo mixtures.

=== Deterioration ===
Cracking is a common form of failure and is often caused by the structural system that supports the terrazzo rather than the material itself. Contact with alkalis or acids can deteriorate the bonding agents used in terrazzo. As the aggregates are often marble dust which is calcium carbonate, strong acid can also cause deterioration to the aggregates. When partial replacement is necessary, a &quot;bracketing&quot; system mixing and matching different chips is used to create potential matches. Aged terrazzo can be resurfaced to restore its original look by re-polishing.

<text>In Japanese folklore, 
 are foxes that possess paranormal abilities that increase as they get older and wiser. According to folklore, the &quot;kitsune&quot;-foxes (or perhaps the &quot;fox spirits&quot;) can bewitch people, just like the &quot;tanuki&quot;. They have the ability to shapeshift into human or other forms, and to trick or fool human beings. While some folktales speak of employing this ability to trick others, as foxes in folklore often do, other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, and lovers.

Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox&#x27;s supernatural significance. The more tails a has, up to nine, the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make sacrifices to them as to a deity.

== General traits ==
The &quot;kitsune&quot; has been labeled as a &quot;witch animal&quot; (presumably due to its &quot;bewitching&quot;) by one scholar, who also qualifies the supernatural foxes as being &quot;goblin foxes&quot; or &quot;fox spirits&quot;. The &quot;kitsune&quot; exhibit the ability of &quot;bakeru&quot; or transforming its shape and appearance, and &quot;bakasu&quot;, capable of trickery or bewitching; these terms are related to the generic term &quot;bakemono&quot; meaning &quot;spectre&quot; or &quot;goblin&quot;, and such capabilities were also ascribed to badgers (actually &quot;tanuki&quot; or raccoon dog) and occasionally to cats (cf. &quot;bakeneko&quot;).

There are also legends of the &quot;kitsune&quot; being used as familiars to do the biddings of their masters, called &quot;kitsune-mochi&quot; or &quot;fox-possessors&quot;. The &quot;yamabushi&quot; or lay monks training in the wild have the reputation of using . In some cases, the fox or fox-spirit summoned is called the &quot;osaki&quot;. The familiar may also be known as the because they were believed to be so small, or become so small as to fit inside a tube.

==Origins==

The oldest relationship between the Japanese people and the fox dates back to the Jomon period necklace made by piercing the canine teeth and jawbone of the fox.

In the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (or &quot;Nihongi&quot;, compiled 720), the fox is mentioned twice, as omens. In the year 657 a &quot;byakko&quot; or &quot;white fox&quot; was reported to have been witnessed in Iwami Province, possibly a sign of good omen. And in 659, a fox bit off the end of a creeping vine plant held by the laborer (shrine construction worker), interpreted as an inauspicious omen foreshadowing the death of Empress Saimei the following year.

=== Chinese influence ===
Folktales from China tell of fox spirits called () also known as nine-tailed fox () that may have up to nine tails. These fox spirits were adopted into Japanese culture through merchants as .

The earliest &quot;fox wife&quot; () tale type (concerning a wife whose identity as fox is revealed after being frightened by the house pet dog) occurs in &quot;Nihon Ryōiki&quot;, an anthology of Buddhist tales compiled around 822. The plotline involves a man who takes a wife, whose identity is later revealed to be a fox pretending to be a woman (cf. below). The tale bears close resemblance to the Tang dynasty Chinese story &quot;Renshi zhuan&quot; (&quot;The Story of Lady Ren&quot;, c. 800), and the possibility has been suggested that this is a remake of the Chinese version. A composite fashioned from the confluence of Tang dynasty wonder tales (&quot;chuanqi&quot; genre, as exemplified by the &quot;Renshi zhuan&quot;) and earlier wonder tales (&quot;Zhiguai&quot; genre) has also been proposed.

The trope of the fox as &quot;femme fatale&quot; in Japanese literature (cf. Tamamo no Mae) also originates from China. Ōe no Masafusa (d. 1111) in &quot;Kobiki&quot; (or ) introduced the story that the queen-consort Daji (Japanese pronunciation: ) was really a nine-tailed fox that led to the destruction of the Yin/Shang dynasty, having seduced its last monarch, King Zhou (Japanese: ).

=== Buddhist context ===

Smyers (1999) notes that the idea of the fox as seductress and the connection of the fox myths to Buddhism were introduced into Japanese folklore through similar Chinese stories, but she maintains that some fox stories contain elements unique to Japan.

=== Shinto origins ===

According to Hiroshi Moriyama, a professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture, foxes have come to be regarded as sacred by the Japanese because they are the natural enemies of rats that eat up rice or burrow into rice paddies. Because fox urine has a rat-repelling effect, Japanese people placed a stone with fox urine on a &quot;hokora&quot; of a Shinto shrine set up near a rice field. In this way, it is assumed that people in Japan acquired the culture of respecting as messengers of Inari Okami.

==Etymology==

The full etymology of is unknown. The oldest known usage of the word is in the text &quot;Shin&#x27;yaku Kegonkyō Ongi Shiki&quot;, dating to 794.

Other old sources include the aforementioned story in the &quot;Nihon ryōiki&quot; (810–824) and &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot; (c. 934). These old sources are written in Man&#x27;yōgana, which clearly identifies the historical form of the word (when rendered into a Latin-alphabet transliteration) as . Following several diachronic phonological changes, this became .

The fox-wife narrative in &quot;Nihon ryōiki&quot; gives the folk etymology as &#x27;come and sleep&#x27;, while in a double-entendre, the phrase can also be parsed differently as to mean &#x27;always comes&#x27;.

Many etymological suggestions have been made, though there is no general agreement:
*Myōgoki (1268) suggests that it is so called because it is &quot;always () yellow ()&quot;.

*Arai Hakuseki in (1717) suggests that means &#x27;stench&#x27;, is a possessive particle, and is related to , the word for &#x27;dog&#x27;.
*Tanikawa Kotosuga in (1777–1887) suggests that means &#x27;yellow&#x27;, is a possessive particle, and is related to , the word for &#x27;cat&#x27;.
*Ōtsuki Fumihiko in (1932–1935) proposes that the word comes from , which is an onomatopoeia for the bark of a fox, and , which may be an honorific referring to a servant of an Inari shrine.
* Nozaki also suggests that the word was originally onomatopoetic: represented a fox&#x27;s yelp and came to be the general word for &#x27;fox&#x27;; signified an affectionate mood.

 is now archaic; in modern Japanese, a fox&#x27;s cry is transcribed as or .

==Characteristics==

 are believed to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of . The word is sometimes translated as &#x27;fox spirit&#x27;, which is actually a broader folkloric category. This does not mean that are ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word &quot;spirit&quot; is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes were believed to gain supernatural abilities.

There are two common classifications of :

* The are benevolent, celestial foxes associated with Inari; they are sometimes simply called Inari foxes in English.
* On the other hand, the tend to be mischievous or even malicious.

Local traditions add further types. For example, a is an invisible fox spirit that human beings can only perceive when it possesses them.

 have as many as nine tails. Generally, a greater number of tails indicates an older and more powerful ; in fact, some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has lived 100 years. (In the wild, the typical lifespan of a real fox is one to three years, although individuals may live up to ten years in captivity.) One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common numbers in folktales. These gain the abilities to see and hear anything happening anywhere in the world. Other tales credit them with infinite wisdom (omniscience). After reaching 1,000 years of age and gaining its ninth tail, a kitsune turns a white or golden color, becoming a , the most powerful form of the , and then ascends to the heavens.

A may take on human form, an ability learned when it reaches a certain age—usually 100 years, although some tales say 50. As a common prerequisite for the transformation, the fox must place reeds, a leaf, or a skull over its head. Common forms assumed by include beautiful women, young girls, elderly men, and less often young boys. These shapes are not limited by the fox&#x27;s own age or gender, and a can duplicate the appearance of a specific person. are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in feudal Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a . (&#x27;fox-faced&#x27;) refers to human females who have a narrow face with close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, and high cheekbones. Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form. Variants on the theme have the retain other foxy traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form.

In some stories, retain—and have difficulty hiding—their tails when they take human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature&#x27;s true nature. A particularly devout individual may even be able to see through a fox&#x27;s disguise merely by perceiving them. can also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee.

Other supernatural abilities commonly attributed to include possession, generating fire or lightning, willful manifestation in the dreams of others, flight, invisibility, and the creation of illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality. Some tales speak of with even greater powers, able to bend time and space, drive people mad, or take fantastic shapes such as an incredibly tall tree or a second moon in the sky. Other have characteristics reminiscent of vampires or succubi, and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through sexual contact.

=== Spiritual possession ===
;(&quot;Kitsunetsuki&quot;)
Stories of fox possession (&quot;kitsunetsuki&quot;) can be found in all lands of Japan, as part of its folk religion. From a clinical standpoint, those possessed by a fox are thought to suffer from a mental illness or similar condition. The idea of &quot;kitsunetsuki&quot; seems to have become widespread in the fifteenth century, though it has already been attested during the Heian period.

, also written , literally means &#x27;the state of being possessed by a fox&#x27;. The victim is usually said to be a young woman, whom the fox enters beneath her fingernails or through her breasts. In some cases, the victims&#x27; facial expressions are said to change in such a way that they resemble those of a fox. Japanese tradition holds that fox possession can cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers.

Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition in &quot;Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan&quot;:

He goes on to note that, once freed from the possession, the victim would never again be able to eat tofu, (i.e. &quot;sekihan&quot; or &quot;red bean rice&quot;), or other foods favored by foxes.

Attempting to rid someone of a fox spirit was done via an exorcism, often at an Inari shrine. If a priest was not available or if the exorcism failed, alleged victims of might be badly burned or beaten in hopes of driving out the fox spirits. The whole family of someone thought to be possessed might be ostracized by their community.

In Japan, was described as a disease as early as the Heian period and remained a common diagnosis for mental illness until the early 20th century. Possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Shunichi Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered . The superstition has lost favor, but stories of fox possession still occur, such as allegations that members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had been possessed.

In modern psychiatry, the term refers to a culture-bound syndrome unique to Japanese culture. Those who suffer from the condition believe they are possessed by a fox. Symptoms include cravings for rice or sweet adzuki beans, listlessness, restlessness, and aversion to eye contact. This sense of is similar to but distinct from clinical lycanthropy.

==== Familiar spirits ====

There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a , , , and hito-gitsune are also called . These families are said to have been able to use their fox to gain fortune, but marriage into such a family was considered forbidden as it would enlarge the family. They were also said to be able to bring about illness and curse the possessions, crops, and livestock of enemies. This caused them to be considered taboo by the other families, which led to societal problems.

The great amount of faith given to foxes can be seen in how, as a result of the Inari belief where foxes were believed to be Inari no Kami or its servant, they were employed in practices of by and practitioners and in the oracles of ; the customs related to can be seen as having developed in such a religious background.

Depictions of or people possessed by them may feature round white balls known as . Tales describe these as glowing with . Some stories identify them as magical jewels or pearls. When not in human form or possessing a human, a kitsune keeps the ball in its mouth or carries it on its tail. Jewels are a common symbol of Inari and representations of sacred Inari foxes without them are rare.

One belief is that when a changes shape, its holds a portion of its magical power. Another tradition is that the pearl represents the kitsune&#x27;s soul; the kitsune will die if separated from it for too long. Those who obtain the ball may be able to extract a promise from the to help them in exchange for its return. For example, a 12th-century tale describes a man using a fox&#x27;s to secure a favor:

The fox later saves his life by leading him past a band of armed robbers.

==Portrayal==

Embedded in Japanese folklore as they are, kitsune appear in numerous Japanese works. Noh, kyogen, bunraku, and kabuki plays derived from folk tales feature them, as do contemporary works such as native animations, comic books and video games. Japanese metal idol band Babymetal refer to the kitsune myth in their lyrics and include the use of fox masks, hand signs, and animation interludes during live shows. Western authors of fiction have also made use of the kitsune legends although not in extensive detail.

===Servants of Inari===
Kitsune are associated with Inari, the Shinto deity of rice. This association has reinforced the fox&#x27;s supernatural significance. Originally, kitsune were Inari&#x27;s messengers, but the line between the two is now blurred so that Inari Ōkami may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune, where devotees can leave offerings.

==== Aburage ====
Fox spirits are said to be particularly fond of a fried slice of tofu called &quot;aburage&quot; or &quot;abura-age&quot;, which is accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune udon and kitsune soba. Similarly, &quot;Inari-zushi&quot; is a type of sushi named for Inari Ōkami that consists of rice-filled pouches of fried tofu. There is speculation among folklorists as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long been worshipped as &quot;kami&quot;.

Actually, the favorite food of the fox, used as bait for trapping or luring them, is purported to be the fried mouse or rat, according to the scenario in the &quot;kyōgen&quot;-play and other works. A scholar has surmised that whether the food be fried rodent or fried bean curd, the association with fox can be traced to the document which gives a list of votive offerings to be made to the Dakini-ten (associated with foxes), since the list includes something called &quot;aburamono&quot; (&quot;oil stuff&quot;)

==== Inari foxes described ====
Inari&#x27;s kitsune are white, a color of a good omen. They possess the power to ward off evil, and they sometimes serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene on behalf of the locals and particularly to aid against troublesome &quot;nogitsune&quot;, those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.

According to beliefs derived from &quot;fusui&quot; (&quot;feng shui&quot;), the fox&#x27;s power over evil is such that a mere statue of a fox can dispel the evil &quot;kimon&quot;, or energy, that flows from the northeast. Many Inari shrines, such as the famous Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto, feature such statues, sometimes large numbers of them.

Kitsune are connected to the Buddhist religion through the Dakiniten, goddesses conflated with Inari&#x27;s female aspect. Dakiniten is depicted as a female boddhisattva wielding a sword and riding a flying white fox.

===Tricksters===

Kitsune are often presented as tricksters, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their victims are usually men; women are possessed instead. For example, kitsune are thought to employ their kitsunebi to lead travelers astray in the manner of a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp. Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its target with illusions or visions. Other common goals of trickster kitsune include seduction, theft of food, humiliation of the prideful, or vengeance for a perceived slight.

A traditional game called &quot;kitsune-ken&quot; (&#x27;fox-fist&#x27;) references the kitsune&#x27;s powers over human beings. The game is similar to rock paper scissors, but the three hand positions signify a fox, a hunter, and a village headman. The headman beats the hunter, whom he outranks; the hunter beats the fox, whom he shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.
Kitsune keep their promises and strive to repay any favor. Occasionally a kitsune attaches itself to a person or household, where they can cause all sorts of mischief. In one story from the 12th century, only the homeowner&#x27;s threat to exterminate the foxes convinces them to behave. The kitsune patriarch appears in the man&#x27;s dreams:

Other kitsune use their magic for the benefit of their companion or hosts as long as the humans treat them with respect. As &quot;yōkai&quot;, however, kitsune do not share human morality, and a kitsune who has adopted a house in this manner may, for example, bring its host money or items that it has stolen from the neighbors. Accordingly, common households thought to harbor kitsune are treated with suspicion. Oddly, samurai families were often reputed to share similar arrangements with kitsune, but these foxes were considered &quot;zenko&quot; and the use of their magic a sign of prestige. Abandoned homes were common haunts for kitsune. One 12th-century story tells of a minister moving into an old mansion only to discover a family of foxes living there. They first try to scare him away, then claim that the house &quot;has been ours for many years, and … we wish to register a vigorous protest.&quot; The man refuses, and the foxes resign themselves to moving to an abandoned lot nearby.

Tales distinguish kitsune gifts from kitsune payments. If a kitsune offers a payment or reward that includes money or material wealth, part or all of the sum will consist of old paper, leaves, twigs, stones, or similar valueless items under a magical illusion. True kitsune gifts are usually intangibles, such as protection, knowledge, or long life.

===Wives and lovers===
Kitsune are commonly portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune who takes the form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox&#x27;s true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if from a dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.

==== &quot;Nihon Ryōiki&quot; ====
As aforementioned, the earliest example of the &quot;fox wife&quot; () motif occurs in the short story included in the &quot;Nihon ryōiki&quot; .

In this story, a man from , Mino Province found and married a fox-wife, who bore a child by him. But the household dog born the same time as the baby always harassed the wife, until one day frightened her so much she transformed back into a construed to mean &quot;wild fox&quot;. Although the husband and wife become separated (during the day), she fulfills the promises to come sleep with him every night, hence the Japanese name of the creature, meaning &quot;come and sleep&quot; or &quot;come always&quot;, according to the folk etymology presented in the tale.

Alternate versions of the fox-wife tale appeared later during the Kamakura-period in the works &quot;Mizukagami&quot; and &quot;Fusō Ryakuki&quot; of the 12th century.

The fox-wife&#x27;s descendants were also depicted as doing evil things by taking advantage of their power. According to the foregoing story, the fox-wife&#x27;s child became the first ancestor of the surname . However, in another tale from the &quot;Nihon Ryōiki&quot;, a story was told about a ruffian female descendant; the tale was also placed in the repertoire of the later work &quot;Konjaku monogatari&quot;. Here, the woman nicknamed &quot;Mino kitsune&quot; (Mino fox), was tall and powerful and engaged in open banditry seizing goods from merchants.

==== Later works ====
Another medieval &quot;fox wife&quot; tale is found in the (c. 11–12th century), Book 16, tale number 17, concerning the marriage of a man named Kaya Yoshifuji, but the same narrative about this man and the fox had already been written down by Miyoshi Kiyotsura (d. 919) in &quot;Zenka hiki&quot; and quoted in the &quot;Fusō ryakki&quot; entry for the 9th month of Kanpyō 8 (Oct./Nov. 896), so it is in fact quite old.

Later the medieval novella &quot;Kitsune zōshi&quot; (or &quot;Kitsune no sōshi&quot;) appeared, which may be included in the Otogi-zōshi genre under the broader definition, and the &quot;Kobata-gitsune&quot; include in the 23 titles of the Otogi-zōshi &quot;library&quot; proper. It has also been noted that the context in &quot;Kitsune zōshi&quot;, which is no longer a fox-wife tale strictly speaking, since the man is a Buddhist monk, and though he and the bewitching fox-woman spend a night of sensuality together, he is not taking on a spouse, and he merely suffers humiliation.

The story about the Lady Tamamo-no-Mae developed in the 14th century, claiming that the vixen captivated the Emperor Konoe (reigned 1141–1155)

A well-known example of the fox woman motif involves the astrologer-magician Abe no Seimei, to whom was attached a legend that he was born from a fox-woman (named Kuzunoha), and taken up in a number of works during the early modern period, 
commonly referred to as &quot;Shinoda no mori&quot; (&quot;Shinoda Forest&quot;) material (cf. below).

Edo Period scholar Hayashi Razan&#x27;s (&quot;Study of the Shrines of our Country&quot;, 1645) records the lore concerning a man from the Tarui clan, who wedded a fox and begot the historical .

==== Ancestral lines ====
A number of stories of this type tell of fox-wives bearing children. When such progeny are human, they possess special physical or supernatural qualities that often pass to their own children.

As aforementioned, the fox wife in the &quot;Nihon ryōiki&quot; tale gave rise to the ancestral line of the Kitsune-no-atae clan, and a woman of great strength named &quot;Mino kitsune&quot; belonged to that heritage.

;(Abe no Seimei)
The historical Abe no Seimei later developed a fictional reputation of being the scion of fox-kind, and his extraordinary powers became associated with that mixed bloodline. Seimei was purported to have been born a hybrid between the (non-historical) Abe no Yasuna, and a white fox rescued by him that gratefully assumed the shape of the widower&#x27;s sister-in-law, Kuzunoha to become his wife, a piece of fantasy with the earliest known example being the &quot;Abe no Seimei monogatari&quot; printed 1662, and later adapted into 
puppet plays (and &quot;kabuki&quot;) bearing such titles as &quot;Shinodazuma&quot; (&quot;The Shinoda Wife&quot;, 1678) and (&quot;A Courtly Mirror of Ashiya Dōman&quot;, 1734).

;(&quot;Kitsune no yomeiri&quot;)

Other stories tell of kitsune marrying one another. Rain falling from a clear sky—a sunshower—is called &quot;kitsune no yomeiri&quot; or &quot;the kitsune&#x27;s wedding&quot;, in reference to a folktale describing a wedding ceremony between the creatures being held during such conditions. The event is considered a good omen, but the kitsune will seek revenge on any uninvited guests, as is depicted in the 1990 Akira Kurosawa film &quot;Dreams&quot;.

;(Takeda Shingen)
Stephen Turnbull, in &quot;Nagashino 1575&quot;, relates the tale of the Takeda clan&#x27;s involvement with a fox-woman. The warlord Takeda Shingen, in 1544, defeated in battle a lesser local warlord named Suwa Yorishige and drove him to suicide after a &quot;humiliating and spurious&quot; peace conference, after which Shingen forced marriage on Suwa Yorishige&#x27;s beautiful 14-year-old daughter Lady Koi—Shingen&#x27;s own niece. Shingen, Turnbull writes, &quot;was so obsessed with the girl that his superstitious followers became alarmed and believed her to be an incarnation of the white fox-spirit of the Suwa Shrine, who had bewitched him in order to gain revenge.&quot; When their son Takeda Katsuyori proved to be a disastrous leader and led the clan to their devastating defeat at the battle of Nagashino, Turnbull writes, &quot;wise old heads nodded, remembering the unhappy circumstances of his birth and his magical mother&quot;.

<text>Amor De Cosmos (born William Alexander Smith; August 20, 1825 – July 4, 1897) was a Canadian journalist, publisher and politician. He served as the second premier of British Columbia.

==Early life==
Amor De Cosmos was born William Alexander Smith in Windsor, Nova Scotia, to United Empire Loyalist parents. His education included a stint at King&#x27;s College in Windsor, following which, around 1840, he became a mercantile clerk in Halifax, Nova Scotia. There he joined the Dalhousie University debating club and came under the influence of the Nova Scotia politician and reformer, Joseph Howe. In 1845, at the age of 20 he joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1852, he left for New York on a steam ship stopping first in Boston. He settled in Kanesville, Iowa (today known as Council Bluffs), for two months where he established a daguerreotype gallery. But the following year the lure of the California Gold Rush beckoned, and Smith continued west, heading overland to Placerville, California. Here he set up a new studio and prospered taking pictures of the miners and their operations. Joined by his brother, the pair moved northwest to Oroville, California, where they engaged in various unspecified entrepreneurial ventures. In 1854, Smith successfully petitioned the California State Assembly to have his name changed to &quot;Amor De Cosmos&quot;, a fancifully loose translation (using Latin and Greek roots) of &quot;Lover of the Universe&quot;, although in Portuguese and Spanish, it literally means &quot;Love of Cosmos&quot;.
The name paid tribute, De Cosmos said, &quot;to what I love most ... Love of order, beauty, the world, the universe.&quot;

==Reformer and journalist==
In 1858, De Cosmos and his brother moved on again, this time heading north to British North America as they wished to live under the British flag once again. They also sensed an opportunity in the booming city of Victoria, capital of the Colony of Vancouver Island. The city, since 1843 a quiet village of about 300 until the spring of that year, was just entering an economic boom as it became a jumping-off point for miners headed to the New Caledonia (now mainland British Columbia) to participate in the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. De Cosmos founded a newspaper, &quot;The Daily British Colonist&quot;, which survives today in its current incarnation as the &quot;Victoria Times-Colonist&quot;.

De Cosmos was the editor of the &quot;Colonist&quot; through 1863, and quickly established himself as an opponent of the administration of Sir James Douglas, governor of the colony and the former Chief Factor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company for Vancouver Island. De Cosmos decried the &quot;family-company compact&quot; of Hudson&#x27;s Bay men and Douglas associates who controlled the political and social affairs of the colony, even after Douglas&#x27;s retirement in 1864.

De Cosmos was a liberal reformer cast in the mold of John Locke and John Stuart Mill. He argued passionately for unrestricted free enterprise, public education, an end to economic and political privileges, and — above all — the institution of responsible government through an elected assembly. However, true to the Victorian spirit of the age, De Cosmos was also a proponent of social progress through economic and population growth. He was a tireless advocate for economic diversification, being one of the first British Columbians to argue for a policy of encouraging development of the &quot;three F&#x27;s&quot; — farming, forestry, and fisheries — that would underpin the region&#x27;s economy for the next century.

==Political career==

As the child of American refugees and having lived six years in the United States, De Cosmos developed a sharpened sense of nationalism. This was expressed in a growing protectionist economic sentiment, and the belief that the colonies of British North America needed to be self-supporting, develop a distinct identity, and form a political and economic union. From such policies, emerged the two great causes of his later career: the union of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, and the merged Colony of British Columbia&#x27;s entry into the Canadian Confederation. To advance the first cause, De Cosmos left journalism and entered politics, becoming a member of the Legislative Assembly of Vancouver Island from 1863 until its union with the Colony of British Columbia in 1866. He advanced the second cause through his position as a member of the assembly of the merged, larger British Columbia from 1867 to 1868 and 1870 to 1871, and as the leading force (with Robert Beaven and John Robson) behind the colony&#x27;s Confederation League. Through the instrumental role De Cosmos played in realizing these two goals, he earned for himself his reputation as British Columbia&#x27;s Father of Confederation.

At the time of British Columbia&#x27;s entry into Confederation on July 20, 1871, De Cosmos was the leading pro-Confederation figure in the new province. That year, he was elected to represent Victoria in both the provincial legislature and the House of Commons. Despite his prominence — or perhaps because of it — Lieutenant Governor Sir Joseph Trutch passed over De Cosmos for the job of Premier, instead asking John Foster McCreight to assume the position.

===Premier of British Columbia===

McCreight resigned in 1872 on a motion of non-confidence, and on December 23, 1872, Trutch asked De Cosmos to form a new government as Premier. De Cosmos populated his cabinet with reformers, mostly born in North America, many of whom would come to dominate provincial politics for the generation. His government pursued an agenda of political reform, economic expansion, and the development of public institutions—especially schools.

De Cosmos was a member of a group of entrepreneurs that saw an opportunity for a steel industry in B.C. using the newly discovered iron deposits on Texada Island, coal from Vancouver Island with a smelter and rolling mill in Vancouver. Rails for the transcontinental railway proposed western construction starting in Vancouver to meet the push from the east would provide the immediate market for the product. Involving himself in this venture in his position as Premier was considered a conflict of interest and precipitated the Texada Scandal and the second B.C. Royal Commission of Inquiry. He resigned as Premier. The Commission however found him not guilty.

===Member of Parliament===

Despite having resigned as Premier, De Cosmos continued to be re-elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Victoria City. Consistent with federal promises to place the terminus of the transcontinental railway in Victoria, De Cosmos, in Ottawa, pushed for completion, especially of the Vancouver Island portion. De Cosmos also became an opponent of land concessions to First Nations in the province, seeing it as a hindrance to British Columbia&#x27;s economic growth and settlement by those of European descent. It is generally conceded that De Cosmos&#x27;s tenure as a member of the dominion parliament was undistinguished .

==Retirement and death==
De Cosmos lost the 1882 federal election and retired to Victoria. Although widely regarded as a stirring orator, a master debater, and a man of great intellectual depth, De Cosmos had always been considered eccentric. Contemporaries paint a portrait of an isolated person (he never married and had few intimate friends; some claimed he had a daughter from a friend) with grandiose manners, prone to public outbursts of tears, and a fierce temper that sometimes degenerated into fist-fights. He had unusual phobias — including a fear of electricity. As he grew older, his eccentricities intensified; he became increasingly incoherent.

===Declared insane===

By 1895 he was declared insane. One of his more notable eccentricities was the founding of a hot food delivery company to prospectors in the Klondike Gold Fields. The difficult logistics of this service scared away investors and ultimately proved its downfall. He died on July 4, 1897, in Victoria at the age of 71.

<doc id="237703" wikidata="Q335434" url="?curid=237703" title="Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk">
<text>Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk FRS FRSE (20 June 1771 – 8 April 1820) was a Scottish peer. He was noteworthy as a Scottish philanthropist who sponsored immigrant settlements in Canada at the Red River Colony.

==Early background==
He was born at St Mary&#x27;s Isle, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, the seventh son of Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk, and his wife Helen Hamilton (1738–1802), granddaughter of Thomas Hamilton, 6th Earl of Haddington. His brother was Basil William Douglas, Lord Daer.

His early education was at the Palgrave Academy, Suffolk. As he had not expected to inherit the family estate, he went to the University of Edinburgh to study to become a lawyer. While there, he noticed poor Scottish crofters who were being displaced by their landlords. Seeing their plight, he investigated ways he could help them find new land in the then British colonies. In 1794, on the death of his brother Basil, Thomas became Lord Daer. After his father&#x27;s death in 1799, Douglas, the last surviving son (two brothers died in infancy, two died of tuberculosis and two died of yellow fever), became the 5th Earl of Selkirk.

In 1798 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposers being Dugald Stewart, Andrew Coventry, and John Playfair.

==Involvement in Canada==
When Thomas unexpectedly inherited the Selkirk title and estates in 1799, he used his money and political connections to purchase land and settle poor Scottish farmers in Belfast, Prince Edward Island, in 1803 and Baldoon, Upper Canada in 1804. (See Highland Clearances for more on the emigration of poor Scots.) In 1804, he was in Halifax and became a member of the North British Society. He travelled extensively in North America, and his approach and work gained him some fame; in 1807 he was named Lord-Lieutenant of Kirkcudbright, Scotland, and in 1808 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

In order to continue his work re-settling Scottish farmers, Selkirk asked the British government for a land grant in the Red River Valley, a part of Rupert&#x27;s Land. The government refused, as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (H.B.C.) had been granted a fur trading monopoly on that land. However, Selkirk was very determined, and together with Sir Alexander Mackenzie bought enough shares in H.B.C. to let them gain control of the land. This position of power, along with his marriage connections (his wife Jean was the sister of Andrew Wedderburn, a member of the H.B.C. governing committee) allowed him to acquire a land grant called Assiniboia to serve as an agricultural settlement for the company. As part of the agreement for the land grant, Selkirk agreed to supply the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company with 200 men each year. He also agreed that the settlers would not be allowed to participate in the fur trade.

As part owner of H.B.C., Selkirk also wanted to stop the North West Company (N.W.C.) from competing with H.B.C. for furs in the region. By placing the Red River Colony astride the trade routes used by the N.W.C. coureurs des bois, Selkirk could cut off the easy flow of furs. However, the local Métis people who already inhabited the area had long-standing ties with the N.W.C. and refused to accept Selkirk&#x27;s control over the area, which was contrary to the Royal Proclamation of 1763.

The first colonization attempt started in 1812, consisting of 128 men led by the new governor, Miles Macdonell. Arriving late in the season they had just arrived and built homes when the winter cut off any hope of planting, and the colony became reliant on the support of the Métis. Even with a full growing season the next year, the colony never thrived. Because of a shortage of food in 1814, Macdonell issued the Pemmican Proclamation, prohibiting the export of food from the entire area. The Métis, who made a living selling pemmican to the N.W.C. traders, responded by arresting Macdonell and burning the settlement.

Robert Semple was appointed as governor of the Red River Colony. By 1816, the violence intensified between the Métis and the newcomers, which resulted in the Battle of Seven Oaks, causing the deaths of 21 of Lord Selkirk&#x27;s men, including the newly appointed governor, and one Métis. N.W.C. partners were accused of having aided the Métis attackers. All were exonerated at trial, and again when re-tried under Selkirk&#x27;s instigation, which back-fired when they successfully counter-sued Selkirk.

Selkirk and his men responded to the Battle of Seven Oaks by seizing the trading post at Fort William that belonged to the North West Company. In the aftermath, Selkirk was ordered to appear in court in Montreal and was charged with four separate offences, all of which related to the alleged unlawful occupation of Fort William. Selkirk reportedly spent most of his acquired fortune defending himself (unsuccessfully) in court, shortly before his death in 1820 at Pau, France. The two companies were merged in 1821.

==Legacy==
Selkirk&#x27;s colonizing ambitions have been memorialized in the names of the City of Selkirk and the Village of East Selkirk, as well as the Winnipeg neighborhood of Point Douglas, the city&#x27;s Fort Douglas Park on Waterfront Drive (where Fort Douglas once stood) and Winnipeg&#x27;s Selkirk Avenue. The City of Selkirk is served by the Lord Selkirk Regional Comprehensive Secondary School, which is administered by the Lord Selkirk School Division. The Lord Selkirk Highway runs from the international boundary between Manitoba and North Dakota, where it connects with Interstate 29 in the United States, to the city of Winnipeg. Mount Selkirk and the Selkirk Mountains were also named in his honor.

The Métis peoples cite Lord Selkirk&#x27;s intrusion as the period of time their identity as a people came into existence. The Métis existed prior to the confrontations with Lord Selkirk&#x27;s men but their armed resistance to foreign encroachment became a rallying point for their shared identity. A flag and a national anthem were born during this period in time. A Manitoba Historical Plaque was erected in Winnipeg, Manitoba by the province to commemorate Lord Selkirk&#x27;s role in Manitoba&#x27;s heritage.

==Selkirk and John Paul Jones==
At the age of seven, Thomas was almost kidnapped by John Paul Jones, commander of an American ship. Peter C. Newman tells the story as follows in his history &quot;The Empire of the Bay&quot;.

In 1778, John Paul Jones, in the sloop &quot;Ranger&quot;, was cruising between Scotland and Ireland looking for prizes. Benjamin Franklin had suggested that he might capture a British nobleman to exchange for American prisoners. Having been born near the Selkirk estates, Jones selected the elder Lord Selkirk.

At the last moment, Jones decided not to go himself, but to assign the duty to two lieutenants and a boatload of sailors. As the Americans approached the Selkirk mansion, a governess saw them coming and removed young Thomas to safety. The Americans knocked on the front door and were greeted by the butler. Lady Selkirk came from the breakfast room to see what the fuss was about. She invited the American officers into the drawing room, told the butler to make tea and to find some whisky for the sailors who were waiting outside. When they explained that they had come to kidnap her husband, Lady Selkirk replied that unfortunately Lord Selkirk was not at home. When Lieutenant Wallingford suggested that instead, they might take the young gentleman they saw on the way to the house, Lady Selkirk replied that they would have to kill her first. After more discussion, Lady Selkirk suggested that, so that their mission would not be a complete failure, they might steal the family silver. The officers allowed as how that might be the best solution, so Lady Selkirk ordered the butler to provide the American gentlemen with what they needed. He filled a sack half full of coal, filled the top half with silverware and presented it to the officers. After drinking a toast to Lady Selkirk, they returned to their ship and presented their captain with his sack full of coal and silverware.

Jones wrote Lady Selkirk a flowery letter of apology, proposing himself to buy back the booty from the Navy and return it to the Selkirks. Lord Selkirk wrote back that he could not possibly countenance the return of his silver without the consent of the Continental Congress. The objects, which became the subject of protracted legal negotiations, were returned seven years later.

==Marriage and family==
Lord Selkirk married Jean Wedderburn-Colville, sister to James Wedderburn and Andrew Colville, in 1807, and fathered:

*Dunbar Douglas, 6th Earl of Selkirk (1809–1885)
*Lady Isabella Helen Douglas (1811–1893), married Charles Hope
*Lady Katherine Jean Douglas (1816–1863), married Loftus Wigram

==Death==
In the late stages of tuberculosis Lord Selkirk wanted to travel to the warm climate of southern Spain with his family from London and agreed to bring young doctor George William Lefevre as his travelling physician. With good weather, Selkirk&#x27;s spirits and cough improved between Paris and Bordeaux. Before crossing the Pyrenees, they stopped at Pau in mid-October 1819. Lefevre wrote about their ride the following day : 

The Selkirks were the first notable British family to have resided at Pau having taken half of the Hotel de Bayard. Winter was severe and Selkirk&#x27;s health declined until he could go only as far as the place Royale in front of their lodgings in a sedan chair to bask in the sun and admire the snow-capped Pyrenees.

On his death, his heir and successor Dunbar was only 10 years old and thus Selkirk&#x27;s estates were put into a trust and managed by four executors named in his will. The Board of Trustees consisted of Andrew Colville (Colvile) of Achiltrie and Crommie, John Hallbrith (Halkett) of Waring, Adam Maitland of Dundrennan, and Sir James Montgomery, 2nd Baronet.

<text>Saccharomyces cerevisiae () (brewer&#x27;s yeast or baker&#x27;s yeast) is a species of yeast (single-celled fungal microorganisms). The species has been instrumental in winemaking, baking, and brewing since ancient times. It is believed to have been originally isolated from the skin of grapes. It is one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic model organisms in molecular and cell biology, much like &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; as the model bacterium. It is the microorganism which causes many common types of fermentation. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; cells are round to ovoid, 5–10 μm in diameter. It reproduces by budding.

Many proteins important in human biology were first discovered by studying their homologs in yeast; these proteins include cell cycle proteins, signaling proteins, and protein-processing enzymes. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is currently the only yeast cell known to have Berkeley bodies present, which are involved in particular secretory pathways. Antibodies against &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; are found in 60–70% of patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease and 10–15% of patients with ulcerative colitis, and may be useful as part of a panel of serological markers in differentiating between inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. between ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease), their localization and severity.

==Etymology==
&quot;Saccharomyces&quot; derives from Latinized Greek and means &quot;sugar-mould&quot; or &quot;sugar-fungus&quot;, &quot;saccharon&quot; (σάκχαρον) being the combining form &quot;sugar&quot; and &quot;myces&quot; (μύκης) being &quot;fungus&quot;. &quot;cerevisiae&quot; comes from Latin and means &quot;of beer&quot;. Other names for the organism are:
* Brewer&#x27;s yeast, though other species are also used in brewing
* Ale yeast
* Top-fermenting yeast
* Baker&#x27;s yeast
* Ragi yeast, in connection to making tapai
* Budding yeast

This species is also the main source of nutritional yeast and yeast extract.

==History==
In the 19th century, bread bakers obtained their yeast from beer brewers, and this led to sweet-fermented breads such as the Imperial &quot;Kaisersemmel&quot; roll,
which in general lacked the sourness created by the acidification typical of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;. However, beer brewers slowly switched from top-fermenting (&quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;) to bottom-fermenting (&quot;S. pastorianus&quot;) yeast. The Vienna Process was developed in 1846.
While the innovation is often popularly credited for using steam in baking ovens, leading to a different crust characteristic, it is notable for including procedures for high milling of grains (see Vienna grits),
cracking them incrementally instead of mashing them with one pass; as well as better processes for growing and harvesting top-fermenting yeasts, known as press-yeast.

Refinements in microbiology following the work of Louis Pasteur led to more advanced methods of culturing pure strains. In 1879, Great Britain introduced specialized growing vats for the production of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, and in the United States around the turn of the 20th century centrifuges were used for concentrating the yeast,
turning yeast production into a major industrial process which simplified its distribution, reduced unit costs and contributed to the commercialization and commoditization of bread and beer. Fresh &quot;cake yeast&quot; became the standard leaven for bread bakers in much of the Western world during the early 20th century.

During World War II, Fleischmann&#x27;s developed a active dry yeast for the United States armed forces, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf-life and better temperature tolerance than fresh yeast; it is still the standard yeast for US military recipes. The company created yeast that would rise twice as fast, cutting down on baking time. Lesaffre would later create instant yeast in the 1970s, which has gained considerable use and market share at the expense of both fresh and dry yeast in their various applications.

==Biology==
===Ecology===
In nature, yeast cells are found primarily on ripe fruits such as grapes (before maturation, grapes are almost free of yeasts). &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; can also be found year-round in the bark of oak trees. Since &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is not airborne, it requires a vector to move.

Queens of social wasps overwintering as adults (&quot;Vespa crabro&quot; and &quot;Polistes&quot; spp.) can harbor yeast cells from autumn to spring and transmit them to their progeny. The intestine of &quot;Polistes dominula&quot;, a social wasp, hosts &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; strains as well as &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; × &quot;S. paradoxus&quot; hybrids. Stefanini et al. (2016) showed that the intestine of &quot;Polistes dominula&quot; favors the mating of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; strains, both among themselves and with &quot;S. paradoxus&quot; cells by providing environmental conditions prompting cell sporulation and spores germination.

The optimum temperature for growth of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is .

===Life cycle===
Two forms of yeast cells can survive and grow: haploid and diploid. The haploid cells undergo a simple lifecycle of mitosis and growth, and under conditions of high stress will, in general, die. This is the asexual form of the fungus. The diploid cells (the preferential &#x27;form&#x27; of yeast) similarly undergo a simple lifecycle of mitosis and growth. The rate at which the mitotic cell cycle progresses often differs substantially between haploid and diploid cells. Under conditions of stress, diploid cells can undergo sporulation, entering meiosis and producing four haploid spores, which can subsequently mate. This is the sexual form of the fungus. Under optimal conditions, yeast cells can double their population every 100 minutes. However, growth rates vary enormously between strains and between environments. Mean replicative lifespan is about 26 cell divisions.

In the wild, recessive deleterious mutations accumulate during long periods of asexual reproduction of diploids, and are purged during selfing: this purging has been termed &quot;genome renewal&quot;.

===Nutritional requirements===
All strains of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; can grow aerobically on glucose, maltose, and trehalose and fail to grow on lactose and cellobiose. However, growth on other sugars is variable. Galactose and fructose are shown to be two of the best fermenting sugars. The ability of yeasts to use different sugars can differ depending on whether they are grown aerobically or anaerobically. Some strains cannot grow anaerobically on sucrose and trehalose.

All strains can use ammonia and urea as the sole nitrogen source, but cannot use nitrate, since they lack the ability to reduce them to ammonium ions. They can also use most amino acids, small peptides, and nitrogen bases as nitrogen sources. Histidine, glycine, cystine, and lysine are, however, not readily used. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; does not excrete proteases, so extracellular protein cannot be metabolized.

Yeasts also have a requirement for phosphorus, which is assimilated as a dihydrogen phosphate ion, and sulfur, which can be assimilated as a sulfate ion or as organic sulfur compounds such as the amino acids methionine and cysteine. Some metals, like magnesium, iron, calcium, and zinc, are also required for good growth of the yeast.

Concerning organic requirements, most strains of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; require biotin. Indeed, a &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;-based growth assay laid the foundation for the isolation, crystallization, and later structural determination of biotin. Most strains also require pantothenate for full growth. In general, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is prototrophic for vitamins.

===Mating===

Yeast has two mating types, a and α (&quot;alpha&quot;), which show primitive aspects of sex differentiation. As in many other eukaryotes, mating leads to genetic recombination, i.e. production of novel combinations of chromosomes. Two haploid yeast cells of opposite mating type can mate to form diploid cells that can either sporulate to form another generation of haploid cells or continue to exist as diploid cells. Mating has been exploited by biologists as a tool to combine genes, plasmids, or proteins at will.

The mating pathway employs a G protein-coupled receptor, G protein, RGS protein, and three-tiered MAPK signaling cascade that is homologous to those found in humans. This feature has been exploited by biologists to investigate basic mechanisms of signal transduction and desensitization.

===Cell cycle===
Growth in yeast is synchronized with the growth of the bud, which reaches the size of the mature cell by the time it separates from the parent cell. In well nourished, rapidly growing yeast cultures, all the cells have buds, since bud formation occupies the whole cell cycle. Both mother and daughter cells can initiate bud formation before cell separation has occurred. In yeast cultures growing more slowly, cells lacking buds can be seen, and bud formation only occupies a part of the cell cycle.

====Cytokinesis====
Cytokinesis enables budding yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; to divide into two daughter cells. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; forms a bud which can grow throughout its cell cycle and later leaves its mother cell when mitosis has completed.

&quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is relevant to cell cycle studies because it divides asymmetrically by using a polarized cell to make two daughters with different fates and sizes. Similarly, stem cells use asymmetric division for self-renewal and differentiation.

=====Timing=====
For many cells, M phase does not happen until S phase is complete. However, for entry into mitosis in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; this is not true. Cytokinesis begins with the budding process in late G1 and is not completed until about halfway through the next cycle. The assembly of the spindle can happen before S phase has finished duplicating the chromosomes. Additionally, there is a lack of clearly defined G2 in between M and S. Thus, there is a lack of extensive regulation present in higher eukaryotes.

When the daughter emerges, the daughter is two-thirds the size of the mother. Throughout the process, the mother displays little to no change in size. The RAM pathway is activated in the daughter cell immediately after cytokinesis is complete. This pathway makes sure that the daughter has separated properly.

=====Actomyosin ring and primary septum formation=====
Two interdependent events drive cytokinesis in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;. The first event is contractile actomyosin ring (AMR) constriction and the second event is formation of the primary septum (PS), a chitinous cell wall structure that can only be formed during cytokinesis. The PS resembles in animals the process of extracellular matrix remodeling. When the AMR constricts, the PS begins to grow. Disrupting AMR misorients the PS, suggesting that both have a dependent role. Additionally, disrupting the PS also leads to disruptions in the AMR, suggesting both the actomyosin ring and primary septum have an interdependent relationship.

The AMR, which is attached to the cell membrane facing the cytosol, consists of actin and myosin II molecules that coordinate the cells to split. The ring is thought to play an important role in ingression of the plasma membrane as a contractile force.

Proper coordination and correct positional assembly of the contractile ring depends on septins, which is the precursor to the septum ring. These GTPases assemble complexes with other proteins. The septins form a ring at the site where the bud will be created during late G1. They help promote the formation of the actin-myosin ring, although this mechanism is unknown. It is suggested they help provide structural support for other necessary cytokinesis processes. After a bud emerges, the septin ring forms an hourglass. The septin hourglass and the myosin ring together are the beginning of the future division site.

The septin and AMR complex progress to form the primary septum consisting of glucans and other chitinous molecules sent by vesicles from the Golgi body. After AMR constriction is complete, two secondary septums are formed by glucans. How the AMR ring dissembles remains poorly unknown.

Microtubules do not play as significant a role in cytokinesis compared to the AMR and septum. Disruption of microtubules did not significantly impair polarized growth. Thus, the AMR and septum formation are the major drivers of cytokinesis.

=====Differences from fission yeast=====
* Budding yeast form a bud from the mother cell. This bud grows during the cell cycle and detaches; fission yeast divide by forming a cell wall 
* Cytokinesis begins at G1 for budding yeast, while cytokinesis begins at G2 for fission yeast. Fission yeast &quot;select&quot; the midpoint, whereas budding yeast &quot;select&quot; a bud site 
* During early anaphase the actomyosin ring and septum continues to develop in budding yeast, in fission yeast during metaphase-anaphase the actomyosin ring begins to develop 

==In biological research==
===Model organism===
When researchers look for an organism to use in their studies, they look for several traits. Among these are size, short generation time, accessibility, ease of manipulation, genetics, conservation of mechanisms, and potential economic benefit. The yeast species &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; and &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; are both well studied; these two species diverged approximately , and are significant tools in the study of DNA damage and repair mechanisms.

&quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has developed as a model organism because it scores favorably on a number of criteria.
* As a single-cell organism, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is small with a short generation time (doubling time 1.25–2 hours at ) and can be easily cultured. These are all positive characteristics in that they allow for the swift production and maintenance of multiple specimen lines at low cost.
* &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; divides with meiosis, allowing it to be a candidate for sexual genetics research.
* &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; can be transformed allowing for either the addition of new genes or deletion through homologous recombination. Furthermore, the ability to grow &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; as a haploid simplifies the creation of gene knockout strains.
* As an eukaryote, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; shares the complex internal cell structure of plants and animals without the high percentage of non-coding DNA that can confound research in higher eukaryotes.
* &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; research is a strong economic driver, at least initially, as a result of its established use in industry.

===In the study of aging===
For more than five decades &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has been studied as a model organism to better understand aging and has contributed to the identification of more mammalian genes affecting aging than any other model organism. Some of the topics studied using yeast are calorie restriction, as well as in genes and cellular pathways involved in senescence. The two most common methods of measuring aging in yeast are Replicative Life Span (RLS), which measures the number of times a cell divides, and Chronological Life Span (CLS), which measures how long a cell can survive in a non-dividing stasis state. Limiting the amount of glucose or amino acids in the growth medium has been shown to increase RLS and CLS in yeast as well as other organisms. At first, this was thought to increase RLS by up-regulating the sir2 enzyme; however, it was later discovered that this effect is independent of sir2. Over-expression of the genes sir2 and fob1 has been shown to increase RLS by preventing the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles, which are thought to be one of the causes of senescence in yeast. The effects of dietary restriction may be the result of a decreased signaling in the TOR cellular pathway. This pathway modulates the cell&#x27;s response to nutrients, and mutations that decrease TOR activity were found to increase CLS and RLS. This has also been shown to be the case in other animals. A yeast mutant lacking the genes and Ras2 has recently been shown to have a tenfold increase in chronological lifespan under conditions of calorie restriction and is the largest increase achieved in any organism.

Mother cells give rise to progeny buds by mitotic divisions, but undergo replicative aging over successive generations and ultimately die. However, when a mother cell undergoes meiosis and gametogenesis, lifespan is reset. The replicative potential of gametes (spores) formed by aged cells is the same as gametes formed by young cells, indicating that age-associated damage is removed by meiosis from aged mother cells. This observation suggests that during meiosis removal of age-associated damages leads to rejuvenation. However, the nature of these damages remains to be established.

During starvation of non-replicating &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; cells, reactive oxygen species increase leading to the accumulation of DNA damages such as apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and double-strand breaks. Also in non-replicating cells the ability to repair endogenous double-strand breaks declines during chronological aging.

===Meiosis, recombination and DNA repair===
&quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; reproduces by mitosis as diploid cells when nutrients are abundant. However, when starved, these cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores.

Evidence from studies of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; bear on the adaptive function of meiosis and recombination. Mutations defective in genes essential for meiotic and mitotic recombination in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; cause increased sensitivity to radiation or DNA damaging chemicals. For instance, gene &quot;rad52&quot; is required for both meiotic recombination and mitotic recombination. &quot;Rad52&quot; mutants have increased sensitivity to killing by X-rays, Methyl methanesulfonate and the DNA cross-linking agent 8-methoxypsoralen-plus-UVA, and show reduced meiotic recombination. These findings suggest that recombination repair during meiosis and mitosis is needed for repair of the different damages caused by these agents.

Ruderfer et al. (2006) analyzed the ancestry of natural &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; strains and concluded that outcrossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions. Thus, it appears that in nature, mating is likely most often between closely related yeast cells. Mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite mating type MATa and MATα come into contact. Ruderfer et al. pointed out that such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present together in the same ascus, the sac that contains the cells directly produced by a single meiosis, and these cells can mate with each other. The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type with which they can mate. The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from outcrossing is inconsistent with the idea that production of genetic variation is the main selective force maintaining meiosis in this organism. However, this finding is consistent with the alternative idea that the main selective force maintaining meiosis is enhanced recombinational repair of DNA damage, since this benefit is realized during each meiosis, whether or not out-crossing occurs.

===Genome sequencing===
&quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; was the first eukaryotic genome to be completely sequenced. The genome sequence was released to the public domain on April 24, 1996. Since then, regular updates have been maintained at the &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; Genome Database. This database is a highly annotated and cross-referenced database for yeast researchers. Another important &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; database is maintained by the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS). Further information is located at the Yeastract curated repository.

The &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; genome is composed of about 12,156,677 base pairs and 6,275 genes, compactly organized on 16 chromosomes. Only about 5,800 of these genes are believed to be functional. It is estimated at least 31% of yeast genes have homologs in the human genome. Yeast genes are classified using gene symbols (such as Sch9) or systematic names. In the latter case the 16 chromosomes of yeast are represented by the letters A to P, then the gene is further classified by a sequence number on the left or right arm of the chromosome, and a letter showing which of the two DNA strands contains its coding sequence.

Examples:
* YBR134C (aka SUP45 encoding eRF1, a translation termination factor) is located on the right arm of chromosome 2 and is the 134th open reading frame (ORF) on that arm, starting from the centromere. The coding sequence is on the Crick strand of the DNA.
* YDL102W (aka POL3 encoding a subunit of DNA polymerase delta) is located on the left arm of chromosome 4; it is the 102nd ORF from the centromere and codes from the Watson strand of the DNA.

===Gene function and interactions===
The availability of the &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; genome sequence and a set of deletion mutants covering 90% of the yeast genome has further enhanced the power of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; as a model for understanding the regulation of eukaryotic cells. A project underway to analyze the genetic interactions of all double-deletion mutants through synthetic genetic array analysis will take this research one step further. The goal is to form a functional map of the cell&#x27;s processes.

 a model of genetic interactions is most comprehensive yet to be constructed, containing &quot;the interaction profiles for ~75% of all genes in the Budding yeast&quot;. This model was made from 5.4 million two-gene comparisons in which a double gene knockout for each combination of the genes studied was performed. The effect of the double knockout on the fitness of the cell was compared to the expected fitness. Expected fitness is determined from the sum of the results on fitness of single-gene knockouts for each compared gene. When there is a change in fitness from what is expected, the genes are presumed to interact with each other. This was tested by comparing the results to what was previously known. For example, the genes Par32, Ecm30, and Ubp15 had similar interaction profiles to genes involved in the Gap1-sorting module cellular process. Consistent with the results, these genes, when knocked out, disrupted that process, confirming that they are part of it.

From this, 170,000 gene interactions were found and genes with similar interaction patterns were grouped together. Genes with similar genetic interaction profiles tend to be part of the same pathway or biological process. This information was used to construct a global network of gene interactions organized by function. This network can be used to predict the function of uncharacterized genes based on the functions of genes they are grouped with.

===Other tools in yeast research===

Approaches that can be applied in many different fields of biological and medicinal science have been developed by yeast scientists. These include yeast two-hybrid for studying protein interactions and tetrad analysis. Other resources, include a gene deletion library including ~4,700 viable haploid single gene deletion strains. A GFP fusion strain library used to study protein localisation and a TAP tag library used to purify protein from yeast cell extracts.

Stanford University&#x27;s yeast deletion project created knockout mutations of every gene in the &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; genome to determine their function.

===Synthetic yeast chromosomes and genomes===
The yeast genome is highly accessible to manipulation, hence it is an excellent model for genome engineering.

The international Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0 or &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae version 2.0&quot;) aims to build an entirely designer, customizable, synthetic &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; genome from scratch that is more stable than the wild type. In the synthetic genome all transposons, repetitive elements and many introns are removed, all UAG stop codons are replaced with UAA, and transfer RNA genes are moved to a novel neochromosome. , 6 of the 16 chromosomes have been synthesized and tested. No significant fitness defects have been found.

All 16 chromosomes can be fused into one single chromosome by successive end-to-end chromosome fusions and centromere deletions. The single-chromosome and wild-type yeast cells have nearly identical transcriptomes and similar phenotypes. The giant single chromosome can support cell life, although this strain shows reduced growth across environments, competitiveness, gamete production and viability.

===Astrobiology===
Among other microorganisms, a sample of living &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; was included in the Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment, which would have completed a three-year interplanetary round-trip in a small capsule aboard the Russian Fobos-Grunt spacecraft, launched in late 2011. The goal was to test whether selected organisms could survive a few years in deep space by flying them through interplanetary space. The experiment would have tested one aspect of transpermia, the hypothesis that life could survive space travel, if protected inside rocks blasted by impact off one planet to land on another. Fobos-Grunt&#x27;s mission ended unsuccessfully, however, when it failed to escape low Earth orbit. The spacecraft along with its instruments fell into the Pacific Ocean in an uncontrolled re-entry on January 15, 2012. The next planned exposure mission in deep space using &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is BioSentinel. (see: List of microorganisms tested in outer space)

==In commercial applications==
===Brewing===

&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is used in brewing beer, when it is sometimes called a top-fermenting or top-cropping yeast. It is so called because during the fermentation process its hydrophobic surface causes the flocs to adhere to CO2 and rise to the top of the fermentation vessel. Top-fermenting yeasts are fermented at higher temperatures than the lager yeast &quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot;, and the resulting beers have a different flavor from the same beverage fermented with a lager yeast. &quot;Fruity esters&quot; may be formed if the yeast undergoes temperatures near , or if the fermentation temperature of the beverage fluctuates during the process. Lager yeast normally ferments at a temperature of approximately or 278 k, where &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; becomes dormant. A variant yeast known as &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; var. &quot;diastaticus&quot; is a beer spoiler which can cause secondary fermentations in packaged products.

In May 2013, the Oregon legislature made &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; the official state microbe in recognition of the impact craft beer brewing has had on the state economy and the state&#x27;s identity.

===Baking===

&quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is used in baking; the carbon dioxide generated by the fermentation is used as a leavening agent in bread and other baked goods. Historically, this use was closely linked to the brewing industry&#x27;s use of yeast, as bakers took or bought the barm or yeast-filled foam from brewing ale from the brewers (producing the barm cake); today, brewing and baking yeast strains are somewhat different.

===Nutritional yeast===

&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is the main source of nutritional yeast, which is sold commercially as a food product. It is popular with vegans and vegetarians as an ingredient in cheese substitutes, or as a general food additive as a source of vitamins and minerals, especially amino acids and B-complex vitamins.

===Uses in aquaria===
Owing to the high cost of commercial CO2 cylinder systems, CO2 injection by yeast is one of the most popular DIY approaches followed by aquaculturists for providing CO2 to underwater aquatic plants. The yeast culture is, in general, maintained in plastic bottles, and typical systems provide one bubble every 3–7 seconds. Various approaches have been devised to allow proper absorption of the gas into the water.

==Direct use in medicine==

&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is used as a probiotic in humans and animals. The strain &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii&quot; is industrially manufactured and used clinically as a medication.

Several clinical and experimental studies have shown that &quot;S. cerevisiae var. boulardii&quot; is, to lesser or greater extent, useful for prevention or treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases. Moderate quality evidence has shown &quot;S. cerevisiae var. boulardii&quot; reduces risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea both in adults and in children and to reduce risk of adverse effects of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; eradication therapy. There is some evidence to support efficacy of &quot;S. cerevisiae var. boulardii&quot; in prevention (but not treatment) of traveler&#x27;s diarrhoea and, at least as an adjunct medication, in treatment of acute diarrhoea in adults and children and of persistent diarrhoea in children. It may also reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

Administration of &quot;S. cerevisiae var. boulardii&quot; is considered generally safe. In clinical trials it was well tolerated by patients, and adverse effects rate was similar to that in control groups (i. e. groups with &quot;placebo&quot; or no treatment). No case of &quot;S. cerevisiae var. boulardii&quot; fungemia has been reported during clinical trials.

In clinical practice, however, cases of fungemia, caused by &quot;S. cerevisiae var. boulardii&quot; are reported. Patients with compromised immunity or those with central vascular catheters are at special risk. Some researchers have recommended avoiding use of &quot;S. cerevisiae var. boulardii&quot; as treatment in such patients. Others suggest only that caution must be exercised with its use in risk group patients.

==A human pathogen==
&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is proven to be an opportunistic human pathogen, though of relatively low virulence. Despite widespread use of this microorganism at home and in industry, contact with it very rarely leads to infection.
&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; was found in the skin, oral cavity, oropharinx, duodenal mucosa, digestive tract, and vagina of healthy humans (one review found it to be reported for 6% of samples from human intestine). Some specialists consider &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; to be a part of the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, and the vagina of humans, while others believe that the species cannot be called a true commensal because it originates in food. Presence of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; in the human digestive system may be rather transient; for example, experiments show that in the case of oral administration to healthy individuals it is eliminated from the intestine within 5 days after the end of administration.

Under certain circumstances, such as degraded immunity, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; can cause infection in humans. Studies show that it causes 0.45–1.06% of the cases of yeast-induced vaginitis. In some cases, women suffering from &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;-induced vaginal infection were intimate partners of bakers, and the strain was found to be the same that their partners used for baking. As of 1999, no cases of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;-induced vaginitis in women, who worked in bakeries themselves, were reported in scientific literature. Some cases were linked by researchers to the use of the yeast in home baking. Cases of infection of oral cavity and pharynx caused by &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; are also known.

===Invasive and systemic infections===
Occasionally &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; causes invasive infections (i. e. gets into the bloodstream or other normally sterile body fluid or into a deep site tissue, such as lungs, liver or spleen) that can go systemic (involve multiple organs). Such conditions are life-threatening. More than 30% cases of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; invasive infections lead to death even if treated. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; invasive infections, however, are much rarer than invasive infections caused by &quot;Candida albicans&quot; even in patients weakened by cancer. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; causes 1% to 3.6% nosocomial cases of fungemia. A comprehensive review of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; invasive infection cases found all patients to have at least one predisposing condition.

&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; may enter the bloodstream or get to other deep sites of the body by translocation from oral or enteral mucosa or through contamination of intravascular catheters (e. g. central venous catheters). Intravascular catheters, antibiotic therapy and compromised immunity are major predisposing factors for &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; invasive infection.

A number of cases of fungemia were caused by intentional ingestion of living &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; cultures for dietary or therapeutic reasons, including use of &quot;Saccharomyces boulardii&quot; (a strain of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; which is used as a probiotic for treatment of certain forms of diarrhea). &quot;Saccharomyces boulardii&quot; causes about 40% cases of invasive &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; infections and is more likely (in comparison to other &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; strains) to cause invasive infection in humans without general problems with immunity, though such adverse effect is very rare relative to &quot;Saccharomyces boulardii&quot; therapeutic administration.

&quot;S. boulardii&quot; may contaminate intravascular catheters through hands of medical personnel involved in administering probiotic preparations of &quot;S. boulardii&quot; to patients.

Systemic infection usually occurs in patients who have their immunity compromised due to severe illness (HIV/AIDS, leukemia, other forms of cancer) or certain medical procedures (bone marrow transplantation, abdominal surgery).

A case was reported when a nodule was surgically excised from a lung of a man employed in baking business, and examination of the tissue revealed presence of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. Inhalation of dry baking yeast powder is supposed to be the source of infection in this case.

===Virulence of different strains===

Not all strains of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; are equally virulent towards humans. Most environmental strains are not capable of growing at temperatures above 35 °C (i. e. at temperatures of living body of humans and other mammalian). Virulent strains, however, are capable of growing at least above 37 °C and often up to 39 °C (rarely up to 42 °C). Some industrial strains are also capable of growing above 37 °C. European Food Safety Authority (as of 2017) requires that all &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; strains capable of growth above 37 °C that are added to the food or feed chain in viable form must, as to be qualified presumably safe, show no resistance to antimycotic drugs used for treatment of yeast infections.

The ability to grow at elevated temperatures is an important factor for strain&#x27;s virulence but not the sole one.

Other traits that are usually believed to be associated with virulence are: ability to produce certain enzymes such as proteinase and phospholipase, invasive growth (i.e. growth with intrusion into the nutrient medium), ability to adhere to mammalian cells, ability to survive in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (that is used by macrophages to kill foreign microorganisms in the body) and other abilities allowing the yeast to resist or influence immune response of the host body. Ability to form branching chains of cells, known as pseudohyphae is also sometimes said to be associated with virulence, though some research suggests that this trait may be common to both virulent and non-virulent strains of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;.

<text>Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt, (September 6, 1817 – September 19, 1893) was a politician and Father of Confederation, the union of British North American colonies into Canada.

==Early life==
He was born in Chelsea, England on September 6, 1817. He was the third son of John Galt, a Scottish novelist, and Elizabeth (née Tilloch) Galt. His mother was the only daughter of Alexander Tilloch, the journalist and inventor who founded the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;. He was a first cousin of Sir Hugh Allan of Montreal, the owner of the Allan Shipping Line which was the largest privately owned shipping empire in the world in 1882. He was educated at Reading School.

==Career==

He was a member of the Great Coalition government in the Province of Canada that secured Confederation between 1864 and 1867. He became a leading figure in the creation of the Coalition when he was asked to become premier of the Province of Canada by then Governor-General Sir Edmund Walker Head. Doubting his ability to demand the loyalty of the majority of members of the Legislative Assembly, he turned down the position. Still, he recommended that George-Étienne Cartier and John A. Macdonald be asked to become co-leaders of the new Government.

Cartier and Macdonald asked him to become Inspector-General of Canada. He accepted the post on the condition that Macdonald and Cartier made Confederation a key platform in their new Government. In 1858, Alexander Tilloch Galt made a motion in the Legislature at Kingston recommending that the Province of Canada ask the British Government to create a federal union of British North America (Canada East and West, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia) and Rupert&#x27;s Land (owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company). The motion succeeded, and Alexander Galt, John Ross, and Sir George-Étienne Cartier went to London to begin the long process of convincing the British to make British North America into the first sovereign Dominion within the British Empire.

As Inspector General, Galt reformed the Province of Canada&#x27;s banking system trade policies. He was the main architect of the Cayley-Galt Tariff, which protected colonial businesses and caused consternation in both Britain and the United States.

On July 1, 1867, Canada East and West, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia became the first provinces in British North America to form the Dominion of Canada. Galt served as the first Minister of Finance in the new Confederation. As minister of Finance, he reversed many of his earlier policies, promoting trade within the British Empire. Following a strong disagreement with Macdonald and Cartier concerning the fate of the Commercial Bank of Canada, Galt resigned from Government. He continued to sit as an MP until 1872.

Nevertheless, Galt remained an important figure in Canadian business and politics. In 1877, The British appointed him as their representative in the Halifax Fisheries Commission concerning American fishing rights in Canadian waters. Galt was sent to London to be Canada&#x27;s informal representative, thereafter a rapprochement with the re-elected Macdonald. As this was the only important office of the Canadian Government overseas at the time, he also travelled to France and Spain to negotiate trade deals with those nations. The British Government knew of these trips and was displeased that Canada had developed a foreign policy separate from the Empire. The British demanded that Galt&#x27;s position be formalized, and in late 1880, he became the first Canadian High Commissioner in London. He left his post on 1 June 1883.

===Business ventures===
Sir Alexander Galt and his son Elliott Torrance Galt used their connections in Ottawa to arrange for Elliot to be appointed the Assistant Indian Commissioner in southern Alberta. Alexander was undoubtedly aware of the work done by Dr. George Dawson to map the coal deposits in south Alberta on behalf of the Geological Survey of Canada. As well, knowing a railroad was soon to be built in the region, Alexander likely saw the economic potential in southern Alberta&#x27;s coal. This knowledge and planning may have been part of why he secured Elliot a post as Assistant Indian Commissioner.
North Western Coal and Navigation Company.

Alexander Galt sent Nicholas Bryant and William Stafford to decide the best location for a mine in southern Alberta. The men took samples at five locations across the region. Finally, Stafford decided upon the west side of the Oldman River. On October 13, 1882, William Stafford and a group of miners from Nova Scotia opened Drift Mine No. 1 near the community of Coalbanks. Alexander created the North Western Coal and Navigation Company to grow his industry with the participation of English investors, the largest shareholder being William Lethbridge. William Lethbridge was named the president of the company, and the growing community called Coalbanks was officially renamed Lethbridge in his honour in 1885.

Alexander and Elliot Galt established the Alberta Railway and Coal Company to build two narrow-gauge rail lines, hoping that the infrastructure would attract other businesses and settlers to the region. One rail line would go east to Dunmore, near Medicine Hat, and the second line would go south to Montana. Canada&#x27;s Governor-General, the Marquess of Landsdowne, demonstrated the Dominion government&#x27;s support of the Galt enterprises by opening the Galts&#x27; railway in September 1885 in Lethbridge.

The Federal Government granted large tracts of land in southern Alberta to the Galt&#x27;s companies in return for building those two rail lines. The Galts wanted to sell that land to colonists and settlers, but the community and the region did not attract new European settlers to move here in the numbers they had expected.

Charles Ora Card was sent to establish a colony of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) in Canada in 1886. He selected a spot &quot;3 miles up Lee&#x27;s Creek,&quot; the current site of the Town of Cardston. A small group of Mormon colonists arrived to establish the community in June 1887.

Card encouraged the Galts to undertake a significant irrigation project because the area around Cardston was so dry. Even though he was unable to secure financing for the project at a time of nationwide recession, the Galts nevertheless formed the Alberta Irrigation Company to purchase the Alberta Railway and Coal Company land for future irrigation projects. Galt, Charles A. Magrath, the Company Land Commissioner, and the Lethbridge News lobbied the Government for almost ten years for additional funding for irrigation projects.

In 1896, the Dominion Government and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) agreed to fund their irrigation plan by supplying cash, constructing a rail line to the Crowsnest Pass and writing off the debt of surveying fees on previous land grants.

The leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah entered into a contract with Galt and Magrath in 1898 to construct an irrigation system in southern Alberta. The agreement required the Church to provide skilled labourers to build fifty miles of irrigation canals from Kimball to Stirling. They were also required to populate two settlements along the planned irrigation line with at least 250 colonists each. These two communities would become the Village of Stirling and the Town of Magrath.

Voluntary immigration of LDS colonists to southern Alberta was slow, despite propaganda put out by the Church. LDS Church leaders eventually resorted to calling members on &quot;missions&quot; to build the irrigation canal or move to southern Alberta with their families to meet the Church&#x27;s contractual obligations for populating colonies.

By 1900, over 95 miles of canals had been completed, including the main canal from the St. Mary River starting from the hamlet of Kimball near the United States border and branch canal to Lethbridge.

The immigration boom to southern Alberta began in earnest in 1905. The Government, the CPR, and Galt and Magrath promoted the region heavily. People lined up for homesteads every year until the outbreak of the First World War. Galt&#x27;s sugar beet farms and factory at Raymond and his model farm near Lethbridge demonstrated that agriculture could prosper in southern Alberta.

Galt&#x27;s company, the North Western Coal and Navigation Company, went through various name changes as it moved into railways and irrigation enterprises. Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier dedicated the 1910 Galt Hospital addition. Since the construction of the new hospital Lethbridge Municipal Hospital in 1955, The 1910 Galt Hospital has served as a senior citizen&#x27;s home, a rehabilitation centre, and the Health Unit. In 1966, the Sir Alexander Galt Museum moved from the Bowman Arts Centre into the Galt Hospital and occupied the top and bottom floors. In 1979, the Galt Museum &amp; Archives took over the rest of the building. The museum has built two expansions to the original building, one in 1985 and the most recent in 2006.

Alexander Galt was also the founding president of The Guarantee Company of North America in 1872, providing fidelity bonds to guarantee the surety of employees of railroads and Government. Today, the company is the largest provider of surety bonds in all of Canada in public works and government services.

==Personal life==

On February 9, 1848, Galt married Elliot Torrance (1828–1850), the daughter of merchant and entrepreneur John Torrance, of Saint-Antoine Hall, Montreal. Among Elliot&#x27;s sibling was Daniel Torrance, who married Sophia Johnson Vanderbilt, a daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and Jane Torrance, who married David Torrance, president of the Bank of Montreal. Galt&#x27;s wife died on May 25, 1850, shortly after giving birth to their only son, Elliott Torrance Galt (1850–1928), a businessman and developer who died unmarried.

Later he married her younger sister, Amy Gordon Torrance (1834–1911). Amy gave birth to eight daughters and two more sons. They lived in Montreal at their house within the Golden Square Mile, which Galt built in about 1860. Galt appears to have had a very non-sectarian approach to religious faith and although the grandson of a Calvinist theologian, Alexander Galt supported both the Methodist and Anglican churches while his wife, Amy, was a lifelong Presbyterian.

Galt was reported to be a Freemason of Victoria Lodge, No. 16 (Quebec) of Sherbrooke.

Galt died in Montreal, Quebec on September 19, 1893. He is interred in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal.

==Legacy==
He has a street named after him: &quot;Avenue Galt&quot; in the borough of Verdun, Quebec, in the city of Montreal where he had lands.

In Sherbrooke, Quebec, he has two streets named after him: &quot;rue Galt Est/Ouest&quot; and &quot;rue&quot; &quot;Alexandre.&quot; The Quartier Alexandre, located downtown, is also named after Galt. There is also a high school in Sherbrooke (Lennoxville) - Alexander Galt Regional High School (http://alexandergalt.etsb.qc.ca/) found close to Bishop&#x27;s University, which is home to approximately 1000 students from grades 7 to 11.

The Galt Gardens public park and Galt Museum (formerly a hospital) in Lethbridge, Alberta are named after him.

Galt was portrayed by Patrick McKenna in the 2011 CBC Television film &quot;John A.: Birth of a Country&quot;.

<text>In atomic physics, the Rydberg formula calculates the wavelengths of a spectral line in many chemical elements. The formula was primarily presented as a generalization of the Balmer series for all atomic electron transitions of hydrogen. It was first empirically stated in 1888 by the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg, then theoretically by Niels Bohr in 1913, who used a primitive form of quantum mechanics. The formula directly generalizes the equations used to calculate the wavelengths of the hydrogen spectral series.

== History ==
In 1890, Rydberg proposed on a formula describing the relation between the wavelengths in spectral lines of alkali metals. He noticed that lines came in series and he found that he could simplify his calculations using the wavenumber (the number of waves occupying the unit length, equal to 1/&quot;λ&quot;, the inverse of the wavelength) as his unit of measurement. He plotted the wavenumbers (&quot;n&quot;) of successive lines in each series against consecutive integers which represented the order of the lines in that particular series. Finding that the resulting curves were similarly shaped, he sought a single function which could generate all of them, when appropriate constants were inserted.

First he tried the formula: formula_1, where &quot;n&quot; is the line&#x27;s wavenumber, &quot;n&quot;0 is the series limit, &quot;m&quot; is the line&#x27;s ordinal number in the series, &quot;m&quot;′ is a constant different for different series and &quot;C&quot;0 is a universal constant. This did not work very well.

Rydberg was trying: formula_2 when he became aware of Balmer&#x27;s formula for the hydrogen spectrum formula_3 In this equation, &quot;m&quot; is an integer and &quot;h&quot; is a constant (not to be confused with the later Planck constant).

Rydberg therefore rewrote Balmer&#x27;s formula in terms of wavenumbers, as formula_4.

This suggested that the Balmer formula for hydrogen might be a special case with formula_5 and formula_6, where formula_7, the reciprocal of Balmer&#x27;s constant (this constant h is written B in the Balmer equation article, again to avoid confusion with the Planck constant).

The term formula_8 was found to be a universal constant common to all elements, equal to 4/&quot;h&quot;. This constant is now known as the Rydberg constant, and &quot;m&quot;′ is known as the quantum defect.

As stressed by Niels Bohr, expressing results in terms of wavenumber, not wavelength, was the key to Rydberg&#x27;s discovery. The fundamental role of wavenumbers was also emphasized by the Rydberg-Ritz combination principle of 1908. The fundamental reason for this lies in quantum mechanics. Light&#x27;s wavenumber is proportional to frequency formula_9, and therefore also proportional to light&#x27;s quantum energy &quot;E&quot;. Thus, formula_10 (in this formula the &quot;h&quot; represents the Planck constant). Modern and legitimate understanding is that Rydberg&#x27;s findings were a reflection of the underlying simplicity of the behavior of spectral lines, in terms of fixed (quantized) &quot;energy&quot; differences between electron orbitals in atoms. Rydberg&#x27;s 1888 classical expression for the form of the spectral series was not accompanied by a physical explanation. Walther Ritz&#x27;s &quot;pre-quantum&quot; 1908 explanation for the &quot;mechanism&quot; underlying the spectral series was that atomic electrons behaved like magnets and that the magnets could vibrate with respect to the atomic nucleus (at least temporarily) to produce electromagnetic radiation, but this theory was superseded in 1913 by Niels Bohr&#x27;s model of the atom.

=== Bohr&#x27;s interpretation and derivation of the constant ===
Rydberg&#x27;s published formula was
formula_11
where formula_12 is the observed wavenumber, formula_13 is a constant for all spectral series and elements, and the remaining values, formula_14 are integers indexing the various lines. When Bohr analyzes his model for the atom he writes
formula_15
where he uses frequency formula_16 (proportional to wavenumber). 
Thus he has been able to compute the value of Rydberg&#x27;s heuristic constant formula_13 from his atom theory and set the integers formula_18 and formula_19 to zero. The effect is to predict new series corresponding to formula_20 in the extreme ultraviolet unknown to Rydberg.

In Bohr&#x27;s conception of the atom, the integer Rydberg (and Balmer) &quot;n&quot; numbers represent electron orbitals at different integral distances from the atom. A frequency (or spectral energy) emitted in a transition from &quot;n&quot;1 to &quot;n&quot;2 therefore represents the photon energy emitted or absorbed when an electron makes a jump from orbital 1 to orbital 2.

Later models found that the values for &quot;n&quot;1 and &quot;n&quot;2 corresponded to the principal quantum numbers of the two orbitals.

== For hydrogen ==
formula_21
where
* formula_22 is the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation emitted in vacuum,
* formula_23 is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen, approximately ,
* formula_24 is the principal quantum number of an energy level, and
* formula_25 is the principal quantum number of an energy level for the atomic electron transition.
Note: Here, formula_26

By setting formula_24 to 1 and letting formula_25 run from 2 to infinity, the spectral lines known as the Lyman series converging to 91 nm are obtained, in the same manner:

== For any hydrogen-like element ==
The formula above can be extended for use with any hydrogen-like chemical elements with
formula_29
where
* formula_30 is the wavelength (in vacuum) of the light emitted,
* formula_31 is the Rydberg constant for this element,
* formula_32 is the atomic number, i.e. the number of protons in the atomic nucleus of this element,
* formula_24 is the principal quantum number of the lower energy level, and
* formula_25 is the principal quantum number of the higher energy level for the atomic electron transition.

This formula can be directly applied only to hydrogen-like, also called &quot;hydrogenic&quot; atoms of chemical elements, i.e. atoms with only one electron being affected by an effective nuclear charge (which is easily estimated). Examples would include He+, Li2+, Be3+ etc., where no other electrons exist in the atom.

But the Rydberg formula also provides correct wavelengths for distant electrons, where the effective nuclear charge can be estimated as the same as that for hydrogen, since all but one of the nuclear charges have been screened by other electrons, and the core of the atom has an effective positive charge of +1.

Finally, with certain modifications (replacement of &quot;Z&quot; by &quot;Z&quot; − 1, and use of the integers 1 and 2 for the &quot;n&quot;s to give a numerical value of for the difference of their inverse squares), the Rydberg formula provides correct values in the special case of K-alpha lines, since the transition in question is the K-alpha transition of the electron from the 1s orbital to the 2p orbital. This is analogous to the Lyman-alpha line transition for hydrogen, and has the same frequency factor. Because the 2p electron is not screened by any other electrons in the atom from the nucleus, the nuclear charge is diminished only by the single remaining 1s electron, causing the system to be effectively a hydrogenic atom, but with a diminished nuclear charge &quot;Z&quot; − 1. Its frequency is thus the Lyman-alpha hydrogen frequency, increased by a factor of (&quot;Z&quot; − 1)2. This formula of &quot;f&quot; = &quot;c&quot; / &quot;λ&quot; = (Lyman-alpha frequency) ⋅ (&quot;Z&quot; − 1)2 is historically known as Moseley&#x27;s law (having added a factor &quot;c&quot; to convert wavelength to frequency), and can be used to predict wavelengths of the Kα (K-alpha) X-ray spectral emission lines of chemical elements from aluminum to gold. See the biography of Henry Moseley for the historical importance of this law, which was derived empirically at about the same time it was explained by the Bohr model of the atom.

For other spectral transitions in multi-electron atoms, the Rydberg formula generally provides &quot;incorrect&quot; results, since the magnitude of the screening of inner electrons for outer-electron transitions is variable and cannot be compensated for in the simple manner above. The correction to the Rydberg formula for these atoms is known as the quantum defect.

<text>Ron D. Dittemore (born April 13, 1952 Cooperstown, New York) is a former Space Shuttle program manager for NASA. He was the shuttle program manager during the timeframe of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. He later served as President of ATK Launch Systems Group. He is currently retired.

== Education ==
Ron Dittemore graduated from Medical Lake High School in Medical Lake, Washington in 1970. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from the University of Washington in 1974, and a master&#x27;s degree in the same subjects one year later.

== Career ==
Before joining NASA at Johnson Space Center (JSC) in 1977, Dittemore worked as a turboprop/turbofan engine development engineer in Arizona. While at JSC, Dittemore held several positions, including flight director on 11 Space Shuttle missions, deputy assistant director of the Space Station Program, and manager of Space Shuttle Program Integration. He assumed the position of manager of the Space Shuttle Program in 1999.

Dittemore was the Shuttle Program Manager for NASA at the time of the disastrous loss of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; in February 2003. On February 5, 2003, Dittemore incorrectly asserted that foam debris from the shuttle&#x27;s external tank that struck the left wing during the launch could not have caused the reentry disintegration of the shuttle. Dittemore announced his resignation from NASA in April 2003.

After leaving NASA, Dittemore became president of ATK Thiokol Propulsion, renamed ATK Launch Systems Group in May 2006, a division of Alliant Techsystems (ATK); Thiokol and NASA had been found responsible, in the 1986 report of the Rogers Commission Report, for that year&#x27;s Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, which also resulted in the death of seven astronauts. , the then 72-year-old Dittemore is retired.

== Personal ==
Ron Dittemore is married to Shirley Ann Seibolts. They have two children. Dittemore is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

<text>William Alexander Henry (December 30, 1816 – May 3, 1888) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and judge. He was one of the Fathers of Confederation and one of the first judges of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Henry was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Shortly afterward, his family moved to Antigonish. He attended Halifax High School then studied law and was admitted to the bar. He was married twice (1840 and 1850). His two sons were William Alexander Henry Jr., a successful Halifax lawyer and Hugh MacD Henry. The elder W. A. Henry served as a cabinet minister in Nova Scotia in governments led by both the Liberals and the Conservatives. He represented the Antigonish region almost continuously from 1840 to 1867 and was appointed attorney general in 1864.

Henry was a strong believer in the benefits that could be derived from a British American union such as free trade and the construction of the Intercontinental Railway. Henry was a delegate to all three Confederation Conferences, and upon approval by the union in the Spring of 1866, he travelled to the London Conference as part of the delegation mandated to compose the legislation. The Nova Scotia delegates voted to accept the Quebec Resolutions into the British North America Act, 1867 but Henry objected to the limitation on the number of Senate seats. He also supported the unsuccessful efforts to have the existence of Roman Catholic separate schools entrenched in the Act. He was one of the attorneys general who helped frame the language. However, it is an unproved tradition that he drafted the BNA Act.

After Confederation, Henry suffered defeat in his own district for the first time in 24 years. He returned to private practice in Halifax and was elected mayor of the city in 1870. Although he was denied a judgeship in Nova Scotia, Henry was one of the first appointed to the newly created Supreme Court of Canada in 1875. He died in Ottawa, Ontario.

Henry was a Freemason of St. John’s Lodge, No. 161 (England) in Halifax, and affiliated with Civil Service Lodge No. 148 (Ontario) of Ottawa on March 13, 1883.

Henry House in Halifax, which served as Henry&#x27;s residence from 1854 to 1864, was designated a National Historic Site in 1969 due in part to its association with Henry.

<text>Mendoza (), officially Province of Mendoza, is a province of Argentina, in the western central part of the country in the Cuyo region. It borders San Juan to the north, La Pampa and Neuquén to the south, San Luis to the east, and the republic of Chile to the west; the international limit is marked by the Andes mountain range. Its capital city is the homonymous city of Mendoza.

Covering an area of 148,827 km2, it is the seventh biggest province of Argentina with 5.35% of the country&#x27;s total area. The population for 2022 is 2,014,533 inhabitants, which makes it the fifth most populated region of the country, or 4.38% of the total national population.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian times===
Archeological studies have determined that the first inhabitants in the area date from the Holocene, but there are few remains of those people to know their habits. The earliest sites of human occupation in Mendoza Province, Agua de la Cueva and Gruta del Indio, are 12,000–13,000 years old. In the basins of the Atuel River, in 300 BC, lived a group of people that lived via hunting and the cultivation of maize, pumpkins and beans. Those valleys saw the rise of the Agrelo culture, ancestor of the Huarpes. They were later influenced greatly by the Inca empire during the 15th century.

===Spanish colony (1550–1810)===
The first Spanish conquerors came around 1550, from the Viceroyalty of Peru. In 1561, Mendoza was founded by the conquistador Pedro del Castillo. Until the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776, the area of what is now Mendoza Province belonged to the Captaincy General of Chile.

===Independence===
With the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, its 30,000 inhabitants became part of the intendency of &quot;Cuyo de Córdoba del Tucumán&quot;, but in 1813, the intendency was separated and the Province of Cuyo created, with José de San Martín as its first Governor. He received important support from Mendoza when he led his Army of the Andes from &quot;Plumerillo&quot; to the 1817 crossing of the Andes, in his campaign to end Spanish rule in Chile.

===19th century===

The Province of Cuyo was ultimately divided in 1820, and Mendoza parted ways with San Luis and San Juan Provinces.

The 1861 earthquake nearly destroyed the city of Mendoza, which had to be almost entirely reconstructed. In 1885, railways were built to the province, allowing for easy transport of the region&#x27;s wines to the country&#x27;s trade hub of Buenos Aires.

Following the development of the wine industry in the province around 1900, Mendoza began to grow quickly, attracting tens of thousands of European immigrants, particularly Spaniards. In 1939, the National University of Cuyo, one of the more important universities of the country, was founded in the province.
===20th century===
Partly in reaction to President Juan Perón&#x27;s populist policies, some of which taxed agriculture heavily to finance urban development and public works, Mendoza landowners formed the conservative Democratic Party, which secured the Vice Governor&#x27;s post in 1958. Increasing their presence in the Mendoza Legislature, the Democrats became an obstacle to progressive Governor , an ally of president Arturo Frondizi&#x27;s. With majorities in both houses by 1961, they had Gov. Ueltschi removed and Democrat Vice-governor appointed in his stead. Elected governor in his own right in 1963, Gov. Gabrielli was deposed following the June 1966 coup against President Arturo Illia; but still benefiting from conservative credentials, he was appointed &quot;de facto&quot; governor by the same military regime in 1970.

In contrast to the pragmatism that had distinguished his 1963–66 term, Gabrielli governed with a hard line, freezing state salaries and ordering large utility rate increases, used the Mendoza police to repress dissent and took foreign policy prerogatives like collaborating with Chilean saboteurs opposed to their country&#x27;s new Marxist president, Salvador Allende. These events came to a head in April 1972, however, when forced the newly unpopular Gabrielli to resign.

Upon the return to democracy in March 1973, Mendoza voters turned to a left-leaning Peronist, Alberto Martínez Baca. Quickly enacting needed labor and land reforms, Martínez Baca, however, made the mistake of appointing affiliates of the extreme-left Montoneros movement, an organization whose armed wing had perpetrated a string of violent crimes since 1970 (and would continue to do so). Alarmed by this move from the otherwise pragmatic Martínez Baca, President Perón had him removed in June 1974.

Becoming more politically independent-minded following these two disappointments, Mendoza voters elected centrist Radical Civic Union as well as populist Justicialist Party lawmakers since Argentina&#x27;s return to democracy in 1983. Though Mendoza has generally prospered since then, its critical wine industry was left reeling from the 1983 collapse of state-owned vintner Bodegas GIOL, whose dictatorship-era receivers had run the wine conglomerate (then the world&#x27;s largest outside Europe), and accumulated over US$6 billion of debt; GIOL closed in 1991.

Elected in 2003, Radical Civic Union Governor Julio Cobos highlighted this independent sentiment by parting ways with many in his party and endorsing newly elected Peronist President Néstor Kirchner&#x27;s policies in 2004. Over the opposition of his party, Julio Cobos accepted the post of running mate to first lady Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of the ruling Front for Victory, in the presidential elections of October 2007. Fernández and Cobos won in the first round, and Cobos became Vice President of Argentina; he was replaced by pro-Kirchner Justicialist candidate Celso Jaque as governor. The province is represented by three senators in the Argentine Senate, currently María Perceval, Ernesto Sanz and Mónica Troadello. Mendoza is represented by 10 deputies in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies.

On 16 July 2008, Vice President Cobos stunned observers by casting the tie-breaking vote against a presidentially-sponsored measure in the Senate that would have raised export taxes on an array of agricultural goods. His faction of the UCR won a significant victory in the 2009 mid-term elections in Mendoza.

==Geography==

The geography of the province descends from at the summit of Aconcagua to the semi-flat lands of the east. A series of longitudinal valles, such as the Uspallata, separate the Andes from the &quot;Precordillera&quot; lower mountains. To the east, the Cuyean plains are crossed by tributaries of the Desaguadero River. Other important rivers include Mendoza River, Tunuyán River, Diamante River and Atuel River.

The climate is continental, sunny and dry in the entire territory of the province, with warm summers and relatively cold winters. The arid soil due to the scant precipitation and the great temperature difference between day and night allows mainly xerophytes and few trees to grow. The annual precipitation lies between 150 and 350mm, and hail is a significant, and not uncommon, problem in the regional viticulture. There are fertile lands surrounding the basins of the many rivers born in the glaciers of the &quot;Cordillera.&quot;

The lowlands have very hot summers (30 °C to 33 °C during the day, or 86 °F to 91 °F) with warm nights in the north (18 °C, or 64 °F) and cooler evenings in the south (15 °C, 59 °F). Precipitation falls mainly as very scarce, but often severe thunderstorms that bring hail and high winds. Falls are pleasant and dry, and winters are cool with daytime highs around 14 °C (57 °F) and nighttime lows of 2 °C (35F). When Zonda winds blow downslope from the Andes, temperatures may soar to 30 °C (86 °F); however, Pampero winds can keep day temperatures below 5 °C (41 °F) and nighttime lows of −8 °C (18 °F) can be recorded. Snow is uncommon in the north, and occasional in the south.

The area around Malargue is located at higher elevation (1400 meters) and thus the weather is significantly colder: summers average 28 °C (82 °F) during the day, but only 11 °C (53F) at night, and winters range from 10 °C (50 °F) to −2 °C (28 °F). Here, precipitation is somewhat higher (350 mm) and winter is stormier than the summer, with 45 mm (1.8 in) falling in July. Snow is much more common, and falls several times every year: on occasion, it can be heavy. Temperatures often fall to −12 °C (10 °F) and up to −23 °C (-9 °F) have been recorded.

The first slopes of the Andes are dry and sunny; however, precipitation increases as one approaches the border with Chile, especially toward the south, where some areas receive over 600 mm (24 in), falling exclusively in the winter, and mostly as snow. Altitudes over 2,600 m in the north and over 2,000 m in the far south usually have ample snow cover. Summer days may be warm and sunny, but nights are always cold, whereas winter temperatures tend to be moderate, with long stretches of sunny (but very windy) weather alternating with very intense snowstorms where several meters of snow may pile up, providing excellent skiing conditions in resorts like Las Lenas, Penitentes and Vallecitos. Mountains often surpass 5,000 meters, and Aconcagua reaches 6,959 meters: at these altitudes, the climate is extremely cold and windy year round, with temperatures down to −40 °C.

Different wind fronts affect the landscape, mainly the Zonda wind, but also the mild Pampero, the warm Viento Norte and, in winter, the very rare Sudestada from the Southeast. The latter wind mostly affects the pampas.

==Economy==

Famed worldwide for its viticulture (with 70% of the 1.5 billion liters in Argentine wine production), the Mendoza economy (Argentina&#x27;s fifth largest) is, however, quite diversified. Its 2013 output was estimated at US$18.8 billion, or, US$10,758 per capita below the national average, at a level similar to Turkey and above Mexico. Agriculture, to be sure (though 7% of the total economy), has long accounted for much of Mendoza&#x27;s foreign exchange earnings (followed closely by tourism, mainly from Chile). Besides wine, other important crops (mainly for the Argentine market) are apples, pears, tomatoes, onions, plums, olives, cherries, peaches and quince. Apiculture, with 30,000 beehives, is another growing activity favoured by Mendoza&#x27;s dry weather.

Mining is important to the Mendoza economy and has grown sharply in recent years, now accounting for 22% of output in 2005 (nearly 5 times the national average). Fourteen percent of the national reserves of petroleum are in Mendoza, also home to large-scale mining of lime and uranium. Manufacturing has long contributed to the province&#x27;s prosperity and still accounts for 16% of the economy. Mendoza&#x27;s main industries are, of course, wine production with 1,200 wineries turning out 1.1 billion liters in 2005, followed by canned fruits, a large petroleum refinery (in Luján de Cuyo), cement and others.
Mendoza&#x27;s services sector is somewhat less developed and diversified than the national average. Tourism, long active in the scenic province, has, since the 2002 devaluation of the Argentine peso, become one of its most important sources of income, with around 700,000 visitors per year. The main attractions are the Las Leñas ski centre, the Aconcagua mountain, and the provincial parks of the Atuel Canyon, Puente del Inca and others. With the recent developments in Argentine wine production, enotourism has also become very popular, with numerous wine-tourism oriented hotels appearing throughout the province. Wineries along the wine route generally offer free tours of the premises with wine-tastings at the conclusion of the tour. In the wine-producing region, the &quot;Fiesta de la Vendimia&quot; (grape harvest festival) receives many visitors in late February or early March. The Christ the Redeemer of the Andes statue in the mountains on the Chilean border is a destination for many excursions.

== Government ==

The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The legislative branch is a bicameral body composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing local laws.

The Constitution of Mendoza Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Mendoza Provincial Police.

==Political division==

The province is divided into 18 local government areas called departments (Spanish: &quot;departamentos&quot;). Each is divided into one or more districts, and has an Executive Department (led by a mayor or &quot;intendente&quot;) and a Deliberative Department (legislature) to run local services. The mayor is elected by a simple majority of the popular vote every four years, while half of the Deliberative body is renewed every two years (re-election is allowed in both cases). The departments can make regulations in accordance with the provincial constitution and the Organic Law of Municipalities, but financially cannot levy taxes, but only charge for services. The most populous cities within a department may have citizens&#x27; committees appointed by the municipal government to perform certain functions.

<text>Archibald Leman Cochrane (12 January 1909 – 18 June 1988) was a Scottish physician noted for his book, &quot;Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services&quot;, which advocated the use of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve clinical trials and medical interventions. His advocacy of RCTs eventually led to the creation of the Cochrane Library database of systematic reviews, the UK Cochrane Centre in Oxford and Cochrane (previously known as the Cochrane Collaboration), an international organization of review groups that are based at research institutions worldwide. He is known as one of the fathers of modern clinical epidemiology and is considered to be the originator of the idea of evidence-based medicine. The Archie Cochrane Archive is held at the Archie Cochrane Library at University Hospital Llandough, Penarth.

==Early life and education==
Cochrane was born in Kirklands, Galashiels, Scotland, into the wealthiest mill owning family in Galashiels. He was acquainted with death from an early age. His father was killed whilst serving with the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers during World War I. His family nurse and his young brother Walter died from tuberculosis.

Cochrane was academically gifted from an early age. He initially won a scholarship to Uppingham School. Then he acquired a scholarship to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he achieved a Double First in the Natural Sciences Tripos. Later, in 1930, he completed two MB studies in physiology and anatomy. He qualified in 1938 at University College Hospital, London. 

Like his sister, Cochrane inherited porphyria, which caused health problems throughout his life. Medical help in the UK was unavailable. Consequently he emigrated to Germany where, starting in 1931, he received psychoanalysis which was undertaken by Theodor Reik, initially in Berlin, then in Vienna and eventually in the Hague with the increasing threat to Reik from the Nazis. While receiving psychoanalysis, Cochrane undertook medical research in Vienna and at the University of Leiden. He eventually became dissatisfied with psychoanalysis. However he became fluent in German, which became extremely useful to him when he later served as a doctor in a prison of war camp. During this period, Cochrane acquired a hatred of fascism and became convinced of the importance of anti-fascism. But crucially, in a precursor of his landmark contribution to medicine: 

In 1936 the Spanish Medical Aid Society was formed in London in response to a request for help from republicans who were fighting fascism in the Spanish Civil War. Cochrane volunteered his services to the committee and subsequently worked in the First British Hospital and in the 35th Medical Division Unit.

==World War II==
Cochrane joined the British Army in World War II. He was captured during the Battle of Crete in June 1941. Subsequently he worked as a Medical Officer in prisoner of war camps at Salonika (Greece) and Hildburghausen, Elsterhorst, and Wittenberg an der Elbe (Germany). His experience in the camp led him to believe that much of medicine did not have sufficient evidence to justify its use.

He said, &quot;I knew that there was no real evidence that anything we had to offer had any effect on tuberculosis, and I was afraid that I shortened the lives of some of my friends by unnecessary intervention.&quot; As a result, he spent his career urging the medical community to adopt the scientific method.

== Early career ==
After the war, Cochrane studied for a Diploma in Public Health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, after which he spent a year at the Henry Phipps Institute in Philadelphia on a Rockefeller Fellowship. In 1948 he joined the scientific staff of the recently formed Medical Research Council&#x27;s Pneumoconiosis Unit in the Welsh National School of Medicine (now Cardiff University School of Medicine) at Llandough Hospital, Penarth. While there he began his famous series of studies on the health of the population of Rhondda Fach — which pioneered the use of RCTs.

The website of the British Film Institute has a video of the Rhondda Fach studies in which Cochrane talks about his research.

In 1956, Cochrane underwent a radical mastectomy to remove what was thought to be cancerous tissue in his right pectoralis minor and axilla.

==Later career==

Cochrane was appointed David Davies Professor of Tuberculosis and Chest Diseases at the Welsh National School of Medicine, now Cardiff University School of Medicine in 1960. Nine years later he became Director of the new Medical Research Council&#x27;s Epidemiology Research Unit in Cardiff. His groundbreaking paper on validation of medical screening procedures, published jointly with fellow epidemiologist Walter W. Holland in 1971, became a classic in the field.

His 1971 Rock Carling Fellowship monograph &quot;Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services&quot;, first published in 1972 by the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust, now known as the Nuffield Trust, was very influential. To quote from the book&#x27;s summary : &quot;An investigation into the workings of the clinical sector of the NHS strongly suggests that the simplest explanation of the findings is that this sector is subject to severe inflation with the output rising much less than would be expected from the input&quot;. According to a review in the British Medical Journal, &quot;the hero of the book is the randomized control trial, and the villains are the clinicians in the &quot;care&quot; part of the National Health Service (NHS) who either fail to carry out such trials or succeed in ignoring the results if they do not fit in with their own preconceived ideas&quot;. Maintaining this challenge to the medical care system as he saw it, in 1978, with colleagues, he published a study of 18 developed countries in which he made the following observations: &quot;the indices of health care are not negatively associated with mortality, and there is a marked positive association between the prevalence of doctors and mortality in the younger age groups. No explanation of this doctor anomaly has so far been found. Gross national product per head is the principal variable which shows a consistently strong negative association with mortality.&quot; This work was selected for inclusion in a compendium of influential papers, from historically important epidemiologists, published by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) in 1988.

Cochrane promoted the randomised trial and is a co-author with Professor Peter Elwood on a report on the first randomised trial of aspirin in the prevention of vascular disease. He retired from the Epidemiology Research Unit in 1974, when he was succeeded in the role by Peter Elwood. After his retirement he was a key adviser in a highly detailed cohort study, the Caerphilly Heart Disease Study.

Cochrane retired in 1974, after which Peter Elwood was appointed as Unit Director. 
==Honours==
Cochrane was awarded an MBE by the British Government for his &quot;gallant and distinguished services in prisoner of war camps. He was later appointed a CBE for his contributions to epidemiology as a science.

<doc id="237719" wikidata="Q731875" url="?curid=237719" title="Divine Intervention (Slayer album)">
<text>Divine Intervention is the sixth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released on September 27, 1994, by American Recordings. The album&#x27;s production posed a challenge to the label, as its marketing situation drew arguments over its explicitness; to give them time to decide over its style, the band released the live album &quot;Decade of Aggression&quot;. Since it was released nearly four years after its predecessor &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot; (1990), vocalist Tom Araya said there was more time spent on its production compared to the band&#x27;s previous albums.

&quot;Divine Intervention&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to feature Paul Bostaph, replacing original drummer Dave Lombardo, who left the band in 1992. Its songs&#x27; origins came not only from television shows, but were also inspired by various other subjects including Rush Limbaugh, Holocaust architect Reinhard Heydrich, and serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. Its cover artwork was painted and designed by Wes Benscoter as a re-imaging of the band&#x27;s early &quot;Slayergram&quot; graphic. Although so much time was spent on its production, Kerry King has expressed his disapproval over the album&#x27;s final mix, saying it should have had more attention.

Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; peaked at number eight on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 15 on the UK Albums Chart, selling over 93,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was later certified gold in the United States and Canada, and was followed by the EP &quot;Serenity in Murder&quot;.

==Writing and production==
Tom Araya said that &quot;when we did &quot;Divine Intervention&quot;, this was the last conference we ever had with a record label where they sat us down and sold us the idea of how they wanted to do &quot;Divine&quot;, and how they were going to do this with the cover... and all these different ideas for the album. Then one guy looked at us and said, &#x27;But we need a hit song.&#x27; And we said, &#x27;But you&#x27;ve got eleven songs, and if you can&#x27;t find a hit in one of them then you&#x27;re shit out of luck because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re giving you.&#x27; So we&#x27;re like saying to them, &#x27;Right, you write the fucking hit song and we&#x27;ll record it.&#x27; That shut the guy up and that was the last time we had any kind of meetings like that!&quot;

Araya described &quot;For this one, I just kind of got inspired by watching TV. That gave me a whole lot of ideas. The whole idea about the dude with Slayer in his arms was brought about because reality is scarier than anything you can make up.&quot; The production of the album posed as a challenge to the record company, &quot;how to market a group whose gore-soaked, extreme music is anathema to radio programmers.&quot; It is the company&#x27;s first attempt to &quot;hit the thrash band&#x27;s core-audience of rabid enthusiasts with a fan-orientated marketing assault.&quot; Araya related: &quot;We decided to take more time to bring this one together. We actually went into the studio with more written material than the past. We completed three out of seven songs outside the studio. We all sort of felt it was important to do it slowly. After the last tour, we had the intention to take the break.&quot;

==Composition==
The &quot;College Music Journal&quot; said that &quot;the band deals almost exclusively with realism&quot; in the album, and noted that it &quot;shocks and splatters like a severed artery, painting crimson pictures of murders, necrophiliacs, and the ravaged, chaotic world they inhabit&quot;. Both the mixing and mastering were criticized, with guitarist Kerry King saying that the band should have &quot;paid more attention to the mix&quot;, and Araya saying that it &quot;is the one (if any) that he would not mind re-mastering&quot;. 
Neil Strauss from &quot;The New York Times&quot; explained many of the album&#x27;s origins. &quot;213&quot; was described as a &quot;love song&quot; by Araya, which was something they had never done before. The song was named after serial killer and sex offender Jeffrey Dahmer&#x27;s old apartment number. &quot;Dittohead&quot; begins by criticizing the legal system for &quot;being too lenient on killers&quot;. The song &quot;ended up not denouncing the system but advocating its permissiveness&quot;. &quot;Sex, Murder, Art&quot; was said by TheState.com to feature &quot;roars about a maddening relationship and his &#x27;pleasure in inflicting pain.&#x27;&quot;

King said that the album contained origins relating to &quot;war stories&quot; and &quot;explorations of madness&quot;. It is Paul Bostaph&#x27;s first studio album with Slayer, resulting in Alex Henderson of AllMusic saying that it is a &quot;positive, energizing influence on Slayer, which sounds better than ever on such dark triumphs as &#x27;Killing Fields,&#x27; &#x27;Serenity in Murder,&#x27; and &#x27;Circle of Beliefs.&#x27;&quot; Henderson also said that they &quot;focus[ed] on the violently repressive nature of governments and the lengths to which they will go to wield power&quot;.

==Artwork and packaging==
The album was issued in a clear jewel box with a die-cut cardboard O-card. It included sixteen pages, which fold out to be a poster, which displays the cover art. Both the disc and the disc tray feature — as described by Chris Morris — an &quot;image reflective of the mania displayed by the group&#x27;s fans, and exemplary of American frequently deployed shock tactics: a kid carving the band&#x27;s name into his arms with a scalpel.&quot; Mike Bone from American Recordings said that &quot;we captured this not only by photography, but with video — him actually doing it.&quot; The front cover was painted and designed by Wes Benscoter, an American artist who would later paint the covers for the other Slayer releases &quot;Undisputed Attitude&quot; and &quot;Live Intrusion&quot;. The album sleeve features for the second time the backronym Satan Laughs As You Eternally Rot. This phrase was first used on the vinyl edition of the album &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; where it was carved into the runout groove of the record.

==Reception==
AllMusic said that &quot;instead of doing something calculated like emulating Nirvana or Pearl Jam—or for that matter, Nine Inch Nails or Ministry—Slayer wisely refused to sound like anyone but Slayer. Tom Araya and co. responded to the new environment simply by striving to be the heaviest metal band they possibly could.&quot; By the album&#x27;s release date, vocalist Tom Araya considered it to be their best album.

&quot;Divine Intervention&quot; sold 93,000 copies in its first week, and by 2009, it sold over 496,000 copies in the US . It was reported that in the same year of its release, Kevin Kirk from the Heavy Metal Shop &quot;ordered 1,000 copies of Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; and sold every last album in a matter of weeks&quot;. Although it is less accessible than its predecessor &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considered it to be their most successful album as of 2001.

<doc id="237720" wikidata="Q517956" url="?curid=237720" title="Malbolge">
<text>Malbolge () is a public domain esoteric programming language invented by Ben Olmstead in 1998, named after the eighth circle of hell in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, the Malebolge. It was specifically designed to be almost impossible to use, via a counter-intuitive &quot;crazy operation&quot;, base-three arithmetic, and self-altering code. It builds on the difficulty of earlier challenging esoteric languages (such as Brainfuck and Befunge) but exaggerates this aspect to an extreme degree, playing on the entangled histories of computer science and encryption. Despite this design, it is possible to write useful Malbolge programs.

== Programming in Malbolge ==
Malbolge was very difficult to understand when it arrived, taking two years for the first Malbolge program to appear. The author himself has never written a Malbolge program. The first program was not written by a human being; it was generated by a beam search algorithm designed by Andrew Cooke and implemented in Lisp.

Later, Lou Scheffer posted a cryptanalysis of Malbolge and provided a program to copy its input to its output. He also saved the original interpreter and specification after the original site stopped functioning and offered a general strategy of writing programs in Malbolge as well as some thoughts on its Turing completeness.

Olmstead believed Malbolge to be a linear bounded automaton. There is a discussion about whether one can implement sensible loops in Malbolge—it took many years before the first non-terminating one was introduced. A correct 99 Bottles of Beer program, which deals with non-trivial loops and conditions, was not announced for seven years; the first correct one was by Hisashi Iizawa in 2005. Hisashi Iizawa et al. also proposed a guide for programming in Malbolge for the purpose of obfuscation for software protection.

== Example programs ==
=== Hello, World! ===
This program displays &quot;Hello, World!&quot;.

===codice_1 program ===
This program reads a string from a user and prints that string, similar to the Unix command-line utility codice_2.

== Design ==
Malbolge is machine language for a ternary virtual machine, the Malbolge interpreter.

The standard interpreter and the official specification do not match perfectly. One difference is that the compiler stops execution with data outside the 33–126 range. Although this was initially considered a bug in the compiler, Ben Olmstead stated that it was intended and there was in fact &quot;a bug in the specification&quot;.

=== Registers ===
Malbolge has three registers, a, c, and d. When a program starts, the value of all three registers is zero.

a stands for &quot;accumulator&quot;, set to the value written by all write operations on memory and used for standard I/O. c, the code pointer, is special: it points to the current instruction. d is the data pointer. It is automatically incremented after each instruction, but the location it points to is used for the data manipulation commands.

=== Pointer notation ===
d can hold a memory address; [d] is register indirect; the value stored at that address. [c] is similar.

=== Memory ===
The virtual machine has 59,049 (310) memory locations that can each hold a ten-trit ternary number. Each memory location has an address from 0 to 59048 and can hold a value from 0 to 59048. Incrementing past this limit wraps back to zero.

The language uses the same memory space for both data and instructions. This was influenced by how hardware such as x86 architecture worked.

Before a Malbolge program starts, the first part of memory is filled with the program. All whitespace in the program is ignored and, to make programming more difficult, everything else in the program must start out as one of the instructions below.

The rest of memory is filled by using the &quot;crazy&quot; operation (see below) on the previous two addresses ([m] = crz [m - 2], [m - 1]). Memory filled this way will repeat every twelve addresses (the individual ternary digits will repeat every three or four addresses, so a group of ternary digits is guaranteed to repeat every twelve).

Note that the official specification does not cover the edge case of 1-instruction programs, where trying to fill the second memory position using the &quot;crazy&quot; operation, as indicated before, will result in [m - 2] pointing outside the program&#x27;s memory region. The reference implementation does not explicitly consider this case either and incurs in undefined behavior.

In 2007, Ørjan Johansen created Malbolge Unshackled, a version of Malbolge which does not have the arbitrary memory limit. The hope was to create a Turing-complete language while keeping as much in the spirit of Malbolge as possible. No other rules are changed, and all Malbolge programs that do not reach the memory limit are still completely functional.

=== Instructions ===
Malbolge has eight instructions. Malbolge figures out which instruction to execute by taking the value [c], adding the value of c to it, and taking the remainder when this is divided by 94. The final result tells the interpreter what to do:

After each instruction is executed, it gets encrypted (see below) so that it will not do the same thing next time, unless a jump just happened. Right after a jump, Malbolge will encrypt the instruction just prior to the one it jumped to instead. Then, the values of both c and d are increased by one and the next instruction is executed.

=== &quot;Crazy&quot; operation ===
For each ternary digit of both inputs, use the following table to get a ternary digit of the result. For example, crz 0001112220, 0120120120 gives 1120020211.

===Encipherment===
After an instruction is executed, the value at [c] (without anything added to it) will be replaced with itself mod 94. Then, the result is enciphered with one of the following two equivalent methods.

; Method 1: Find the result below. Store the ASCII code of the character below it at [c].

 0000000000111111111122222222223333333333444444444455555555556666666666777777777788888888889999
 0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123
 9m&lt;.TVac`uY*MK&#x27;X~xDl}REokN:#?G&quot;i@5z]&amp;gqtyfr$(we4{WP)H-Zn,[%\3dL+Q;&gt;U!pJS72FhOA1CB6v^=I_0/8|jsb
; Method 2: Find the result below. Store the encrypted version at [c].

Lou Scheffer&#x27;s cryptanalysis of Malbolge mentions six different cycles in the permutation. They are listed here:

* 33 ⇒ 53 ⇒ 45 ⇒ 119 ⇒ 78 ⇒ 49 ⇒ 87 ⇒ 48 ⇒ 123 ⇒ 71 ⇒ 83 ⇒ 94 ⇒ 57 ⇒ 91 ⇒ 106 ⇒ 77 ⇒ 65 ⇒ 59 ⇒ 92 ⇒ 115 ⇒ 82 ⇒ 118 ⇒ 107 ⇒ 75 ⇒ 104 ⇒ 89 ⇒ 56 ⇒ 44 ⇒ 40 ⇒ 121 ⇒ 35 ⇒ 93 ⇒ 98 ⇒ 84 ⇒ 61 ⇒ 100 ⇒ 97 ⇒ 46 ⇒ 101 ⇒ 99 ⇒ 86 ⇒ 95 ⇒ 109 ⇒ 88 ⇒ 47 ⇒ 52 ⇒ 72 ⇒ 55 ⇒ 110 ⇒ 126 ⇒ 64 ⇒ 81 ⇒ 54 ⇒ 90 ⇒ 124 ⇒ 34 ⇒ 122 ⇒ 63 ⇒ 43 ⇒ 36 ⇒ 38 ⇒ 113 ⇒ 108 ⇒ 39 ⇒ 116 ⇒ 69 ⇒ 112 ⇒ 68 ⇒ 33 ...
* 37 ⇒ 103 ⇒ 117 ⇒ 111 ⇒ 120 ⇒ 58 ⇒ 37 ...
* 41 ⇒ 102 ⇒ 96 ⇒ 60 ⇒ 51 ⇒ 41 ...
* 42 ⇒ 114 ⇒ 125 ⇒ 105 ⇒ 42 ...
* 50 ⇒ 80 ⇒ 66 ⇒ 62 ⇒ 76 ⇒ 79 ⇒ 67 ⇒ 85 ⇒ 73 ⇒ 50 ...
* 70 ⇒ 74 ⇒ 70 ...

These cycles can be used to create loops that do different things each time and that eventually become repetitive. Lou Scheffer used this idea to create a Malbolge program (included in his cryptanalysis linked below) that repeats anything the user inputs.

== Variants ==
Malbolge is not Turing-complete, due to its memory limits. However, it otherwise has sequential execution, repetition, and conditional-execution. Several attempts have been made to create Turing-complete versions of Malbolge:

* Malbolge20 is a version of Malbolge with an expanded word-size of 20 trits, allowing one to write a program with a size of up to ~3.4 gigabytes.
* Malbolge-T is a theoretical version of Malbolge that resets the input/output stream upon reaching the end, allowing for unbounded programs. Malbolge-T would be backward compatible with Malbolge.
* Malbolge Unshackled is a Turing-complete variation, allowing for programs of any length. However, due to command variations to allow for values above 257, valid Malbolge programs will not necessarily run correctly in Malbolge Unshackled.

<text>Cochrane is a British international charitable organisation formed to synthesize medical research findings to facilitate evidence-based choices about health interventions involving health professionals, patients and policy makers. It includes 53 review groups that are based at research institutions worldwide. Cochrane has over volunteer experts from around the world.

The group conducts systematic reviews of healthcare interventions and diagnostic tests and publishes them in the Cochrane Library. According to the Library, articles are available via one-click access, but some require paid subscription or registration before reading. A few reviews, in occupational health for example, incorporate results from non-randomised observational studies as well as controlled before–after (CBA) studies and interrupted time-series studies.

==History==

Cochrane, previously known as the Cochrane Collaboration, was founded in 1993 under the leadership of Iain Chalmers. It was developed in response to Archie Cochrane&#x27;s call for up-to-date, systematic reviews of all relevant randomised controlled trials in the field of healthcare.

In 1998, the Cochrane Economics Methods Group (CEMG) was established to facilitate the basing of decisions on health economics, evidence-based medicine, and systematic reviews.

Cochrane&#x27;s suggestion that methods used to prepare and maintain reviews of controlled trials in pregnancy and childbirth be applied more widely was taken up by the Research and Development Programme, initiated to support the National Health Service. Through the NHS research and development programme, led by Michael Peckham, funds were provided to establish a &quot;Cochrane Centre&quot;, to collaborate with others, in the UK and elsewhere, to facilitate systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials across all areas of healthcare.

In 2004, the Campbell Collaboration joined with the CEMG to form the Campbell &amp; Cochrane Economics Methods Group (CCEMG).

In 2013 the organization published an editorial describing its efforts to train people in developing nations to perform Cochrane reviews. A 2017 editorial briefly discussed the history of Cochrane methodological approaches, such as including studies that use methodologies in lieu of randomised control trials and the challenge of having evidence adopted in practice.

During its 2018 annual meeting, the Cochrane board expelled Peter C. Gøtzsche, board member and director of Cochrane&#x27;s Nordic center, from the organization, telling &quot;Nature&quot; that it had received &quot;numerous complaints&quot; about Gøtzsche after he co-authored an article in &quot;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&quot; alleging bias in Cochrane&#x27;s May 2018 review of HPV vaccines. Gøtzsche&#x27;s expulsion led four elected board members to resign in protest, which in turn led the board to cut two appointed members in order to comply with the ratio of elected to appointed members required by the organization&#x27;s charter. Gøtzsche announced that this had happened via an open letter, in which he said there is a &quot;growing top-down authoritarian culture and an increasingly commercial business model&quot; taking root at Cochrane that &quot;threaten the scientific, moral and social objectives of the organization&quot;. Gøtzsche remains an outspoken critic of Cochrane&#x27;s relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. The Cochrane board stated that Gøtzsche was expelled for his behavior, which had been reviewed by an independent counsel hired by Cochrane.

==Reception==
A 2004 editorial in the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; noted that Cochrane reviews appear to be more up to date and of better quality than other reviews, describing them as &quot;the best single resource for methodologic research and for developing the science of meta-epidemiology&quot; and crediting them with leading to methodological improvements in the medical literature.

Studies comparing the quality of Cochrane meta-analyses in the fields of infertility, physiotherapy, and orthodontics to those published by other sources have concluded that Cochrane reviews incorporate superior methodological rigor. A broader analysis across multiple therapeutic areas reached similar conclusions but was performed by Cochrane authors. Compared to non-Cochrane reviews, those from Cochrane are less likely to reach a positive conclusion about the utility of medical interventions.

Key criticisms that have been directed at Cochrane&#x27;s studies include a failure to include a sufficiently large number of unpublished studies, failure to pre-specify or failure to abide by pre-specified rules for endpoint or trial inclusion, insufficiently frequent updating of reviews, an excessively high percentage of inconclusive reviews, and a high incidence of ghostwriting and honorary authorship. In some cases Cochrane&#x27;s internal structure may make it difficult to publish studies that run against the preconceived opinions of internal subject matter experts.

==Partnerships==

===World Health Organization===
Cochrane maintains an official relationship with the World Health Organization that affords Cochrane the right to appoint nonvoting representatives to WHO meetings, including sessions of the World Health Assembly, and make statements on WHO resolutions.

===Wikipedia===

In 2014, the Cochrane-Wikipedia partnership was formalised. This supports the inclusion of relevant evidence within all Wikipedia medical articles, as well as processes to help ensure that medical information included in Wikipedia is of the highest quality and accuracy. Wikipedia and Cochrane collaborate to increase the incorporation of Cochrane research into Wikipedia articles and provide Wikipedia editors with resources for interpreting medical data. Cochrane and John Wiley and Sons, publisher of Cochrane reviews, make one hundred free Cochrane accounts available to Wikipedia medical editors—the financial value of which has been estimated by Cochrane at between thirty thousand and eighty thousand US dollars per annum—and pay a nominal stipend and travel expenses to support a Wikipedian in Residence at Cochrane.

In 2014, the Cochrane blog hosted a rebuttal, written by four Wikipedia medical editors, of an article published in the &quot;Journal of the American Osteopathic Association&quot; that was critical of the accuracy of Wikipedia medical content.

=== Funding partners ===
Cochrane receives funding from governments, supranational organizations, non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, hospitals, and foundations, while avoiding funding from corporate interests. Primary government donors include the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), the Danish Health Authority, the Federal Ministry of Health (Germany), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Academic funders include McMaster University, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Kazan Federal University, and University of Copenhagen, among others. Funding from foundations includes the National Research Foundation (South Africa) and the Gerber Foundation.

==Public involvement==
Cochrane involves patients and the public via community curation, to produce systematic reviews and other outputs. Tasks can be organised as &#x27;entry level&#x27; or higher. Tasks include:
* Joining a collaborative volunteer effort to help categorise and summarise healthcare evidence
* Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
* Translation of reviews into other languages

A recent systematic review of how people were involved in systematic reviews aimed to document the evidence-base relating to stakeholder involvement in systematic reviews and to use this evidence to describe how stakeholders have been involved in systematic reviews. Thirty per cent involved patients and/or carers.

While there has been some criticism of how Cochrane prioritises systematic reviews, a 2018 project involved people in helping identify research priorities to inform future Cochrane Reviews.

The representation of women as editors in Cochrane was found to be better than that of other organizations.

<doc id="237726" wikidata="Q332513" url="?curid=237726" title="Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto">
<text>Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto, (; 23 April 175121 June 1814), known as Sir Gilbert Elliott, 4th Baronet until 1797, and the Lord Minto from 1797 to 1813, was a British diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1776 and 1795. He was viceroy of the short-lived Anglo-Corsican Kingdom from 1794 to 1796 and went on to become Governor-General of India between July 1807 and 1813.

==Background and education==
Minto was born in Edinburgh, the eldest son of Sir Gilbert Elliot, 3rd Baronet, and Agnes, daughter of Hugh Dalrymple-Murray-Kynynmound. He was the nephew of John Elliott, Governor of Newfoundland, Andrew Elliot the 41st Colonial Governor of New York, and of Jean Elliot the poet.

Hugh Elliot was his younger brother and Sir Charles Elliot his nephew. About 1763 Elliot and his brother Hugh were sent to Paris, where their studies were supervised by the Scottish philosopher David Hume, and where they became intimate with Honoré Mirabeau. Having passed the winters of 1766 and 1767 at the University of Edinburgh, Minto entered Christ Church, Oxford, and on quitting the university he was called to the bar .

==Career==
In 1776 Minto entered Parliament as an independent Whig MP for Morpeth. He became very friendly with Edmund Burke, whom he helped in the attack on Warren Hastings and Sir Elijah Impey, and was twice an unsuccessful candidate for the office of Speaker, in the elections of January 1789 and June 1789.

In 1793 he was appointed Civil Commissioner for Dunkirk which was then under Siege of Dunkirk (1793) by Coalition forces. However, the siege proved unsuccessful and the appointment perforce remained only on paper. Later he was given a similar appointment for Toulon, which proved similarly abortive.

He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1793 and in 1794 he was appointed as viceroy of the short-lived Anglo-Corsican Kingdom. In 1797 he assumed the additional names of Murray and Kynynmound and was created Baron Minto, of Minto in the County of Roxburgh. From 1799 to 1801 he was Envoy-Extraordinary to Austria, and having been for a few months President of the Board of Control he was appointed Governor-General of India at the end of 1806, with his term starting on 31 July 1807. The district of Minto in New South Wales, Australia, (now a suburb of Sydney) was named after him in 1809. In 1810 he successfully requested the release of the British navigator, Matthew Flinders, from his six-year imprisonment on Isle of France (Mauritius). He governed until 1813, during which he expanded the British presence in the area to the Moluccas, Java, and other Dutch possessions in the East Indies during the Napoleonic Wars. He was then created Viscount Melgund, of Melgund in the County of Forfar, and Earl of Minto, of Minto in the County of Roxburgh.

==Family==
Minto married Anna Maria Amyand (26 March 1752 – 8 March 1829), daughter of Sir George Amyand, 1st Baronet and sister-in-law of Lord Malmesbury, in 1777. She was known as Lady Elliot, her formal title being Countess of Minto. The ship &quot;Lady Elliot&quot;, built in Bengal, India, in 1815, inspired its captain to name an island off the Queensland coast Lady Elliot Island. The ship was probably later wrecked on Lady Elliot Reef.

Their children were:

*Anna Maria (d. 18 Oct. 1855) married Lt.-Gen. Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin. No issue.
*Harry Mary Frances (d. July 1825). Died young.
*Gilbert, 2nd Earl Minto
*Admiral the Hon. Sir George Elliot
*Hon. John Elliot (b. 1788, d. 1862) was a politician.
*Catherine Sarah (circa 1798-25 June 1862), who married John Boileau, 1st Baronet. Had issue.

Lord Minto died at Stevenage, Hertfordshire, on 21 June 1814, aged 63, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, along with his brother Hugh. The inscription reads:

He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Gilbert.

<text>Sir Elijah Impey (13 June 17321 October 1809) was a British judge who served as the first chief justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, Chief Justice of the Sadr Diwani Adalat and Member of Parliament for New Romney.

==Life==

Elijah Impey was born on 13 June 1732 at Butterwick House in Hammersmith. He was the youngest son of merchant Elijah Impey (1683–1756) and his second wife Martha, daughter of James Fraser. He was educated at Westminster School with Warren Hastings. He was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1751 and proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1752, graduating in 1756 as the second Chancellor&#x27;s classical medallist and becoming a fellow in 1757. He was called to the bar in 1756. He then practised law for seventeen years on the western circuit. On 18 January 1768, he married Mary Reade, the daughter of a baronet from Oxfordshire. They had five sons and two daughters. Impey also had two illegitimate children with Elizabeth Curbyshire.

In 1773 the Regulating Act reformed the government of East India Company-ruled Bengal, establishing the Bengal supreme council and a supreme court with Warren Hastings as the first governor-general. Impey was appointed the first chief justice of the new supreme court at Calcutta in March 1774 and knighted later that month. He arrived in Calcutta with the other supreme court judges in October. En route to India he learned Bengali and Urdu, and once there studied Persian. He was accompanied by his wife, who became one of the first British patrons of Indian artists. From the mid-1770s Impey and his wife hired local artists to paint the various birds, animals and native plants, life-sized where possible, and in natural surroundings. The collection is often known as the Impey Album.

Not long after Impey&#x27;s appointment, the shortcomings of the newly established system created problems for the administration in Bengal. The jurisdiction of the supreme court and the powers of the council were not clearly defined, leading to disputes between the two branches. The council itself, made up of the governor-general and four councillors, was divided into two hostile factions, one supporting and the other opposing Governor-General Hastings. 

In 1775 Impey became embroiled in the legal processes surrounding Maharaja Nandakumar, an Indian notable who accused Hastings of corruption. After accusing Hastings, Nandakumar himself was accused of an instance of forgery from 1769. While the accusations against Nandakumar were advanced by his Indian enemies, and there is no evidence that they were in direct contact with Hastings, they were encouraged by one of Hastings&#x27;s closest friends. Nandakumar was sentenced to death under the British statute that made forgery a capital crime. Impey refused to allow a reprieve or a stay of execution. He later justified his decision by stating that this would have undermined the authority of the court because the evidence of wrongdoing was so obvious. However, there were contemporary allegations that the execution was the result of a conspiracy by Hastings and Impey. Later, these allegations were repeated by historian Thomas Babington Macaulay in his essay on Hastings, which strengthened the popular perception of Impey as a partial judge. This theory has generally been discounted by later historians, although Impey&#x27;s refusal to grant reprieve or stay of execution has been criticised. It was also not clear at the time that the British statute on forgery applied in India.

In 1790 Impey was returned to Parliament as the member for New Romney constituency and spent the next seven years as an MP before retiring to Newick Park near Brighton. He died there in 1809 and was buried in the family vault at St Paul&#x27;s, Hammersmith, London. With his wife he is commemorated in the church with a wall monument by Peter Rouw. He had married on 18 January 1768 Mary, daughter of Sir John Reade, 5th Baronet, of Shipton Court, Oxfordshire; they had five sons.

In 1795 his application for a fellowship of the Royal Society was rejected.

<doc id="237734" wikidata="Q12446030" url="?curid=237734" title="Maharaja Nandakumar">
<text>Maharaja Nandakumar (also known as Nuncomar; 1705 – died 5 August 1775) was an Indian tax collector for various regions in what is modern-day West Bengal. Nanda Kumar was born at Bhadrapur, which is now in Birbhum. Nandakumar was appointed by the East India Company to be the Dewan (tax collector) for Burdwan, Nadia and Hooghly in 1764, following the removal of Warren Hastings from the post.
In 1773, when Hastings was reinstated as governor-general of Bengal, Nandakumar brought accusations against him of accepting or giving bribes that were entertained by Sir Philip Francis and the other members of the Supreme Council of Bengal. However, Hastings overruled the council&#x27;s charges. Thereafter, in 1775, he brought charges of document forgery against Nandakumar. The Maharaja was tried under Elijah Impey, India&#x27;s first Chief Justice, and friend of Warren Hastings, was found guilty, and hanged in Kolkata on 5 August 1775.

==Early life==
Nandkumar was born in a Brahmin family. He held posts under Nawab of Bengal. After the Battle of Plassey, he was recommended to Robert Clive for appointment as their agent to collect revenues of Burdwan, Nadia and Hooghly. The title &quot;Maharaja&quot; was conferred on Nandakumar by Shah Alam II in 1764. He was appointed Collector of Burdwan, Nadia, and Hugli by the East India Company in 1764, in place of Warren Hastings. He learnt Vaishnavism from Radhamohana Thakura.

==Forgery conviction==
After 1765 Nandakumar fell out of favour with the British. In 1772 his old enemy Warren Hastings returned to Bengal and reluctantly turned to Nandakumar for evidence to support the dismissal of the deputy nawab Muhammad Reza Khan. This limited cooperation between the two was short-lived, however, and Nandakumar felt slighted by Hastings. Nandakumar saw an opportunity to advance his interests in the conflict between Hastings and the newly appointed British councillors. In order to assist the councillors in removing Hastings, Nandakumar accused the governor-general of accepting presents worth about £40,000 from the nawabs, among other allegations. He alleged as well that Hastings had sold offices and bribed him with more than one-third of a million rupees. Hastings declined to respond to the charges at the time, although years later he admitted that he had accepted over £15,000 in &quot;customary allowances given to the governor visiting the nawab&quot;. According to P. J. Marshall, it is likely that Hastings had accepted other &quot;customary emoluments&quot; as well, but the rest of Nandakumar&#x27;s allegations cannot be proved.

During the proceedings resulting from Nandakumar&#x27;s allegations, an accusation of forgery going back to 1769 was brought against him. The prosecution against Nandakumar was advanced by his Indian enemies, who were encouraged by one of Hastings&#x27;s closest friends, although there is no evidence that they were in direct contact with Hastings himself. The case was presided over by Elijah Impey, the first Chief Justice of Supreme Court in Calcutta, who was an old friend of Hastings since their school years. Nandakumar was sentenced to death under the British statute that made forgery a capital crime. He wrote the following in his last petition: &quot;They put me to death out of Enmity and Partiality to the Gentlemen who have betrayed their Trust&quot;. He was hanged at Cooly Bazaar, Calcutta, to the north of present-day Vidyasagar Setu, on 5 August 1775. He was survived by his wife, the Rani Kshemankari, a son, and two daughters. 

Nandakumar&#x27;s execution has frequently been characterised as a case of judicial murder. While it is generally accepted that Nandakumar had technically committed forgery, it was not clear that the British statute on forgery applied in India. Elijah Impey later justified his decision to refuse reprieve, stating that this would have undermined the authority of the court because the evidence of wrongdoing was so obvious. In his own time and since, Hastings has been accused of advancing Nandakumar&#x27;s prosecution and possibly influencing the verdict. He strongly denied these accusations. According to Marshall, the independence of the judges in the case &quot;seems in retrospect to be beyond question&quot;, but the execution of Nandakumar was clearly beneficial for Hastings since it stemmed the tide of accusations against him. In 1788 an unsuccessful attempt was made in the House of Commons to impeach Impey for his decision in Nandakumar&#x27;s trial.

<doc id="237735" wikidata="Q4778200" url="?curid=237735" title="Anya Gallaccio">
<text>Anya Gallaccio (born 1963) is a Scottish artist, who creates site-specific, minimalist installations and often works with organic matter (including chocolate, sugar, flowers and ice).

Her use of organic materials results in natural processes of transformation and decay, meaning that Gallaccio is unable to predict the result of her installations. Something which at the start of an exhibition may be pleasurable, such as the scent of flowers or chocolate, would inevitably become increasingly unpleasant over time. The timely and site-specific nature of her work makes it notoriously difficult to document. Her work therefore challenges the traditional notion that an art object or sculpture should essentially be a monument within a museum or gallery. Instead her work often lives through the memory of those that saw and experienced it – or the concept of the artwork itself.

==Early life==
Born in Paisley, Scotland, to TV producer George Gallaccio and actress Maureen Morris. She grew up in south west London, England and studied at Kingston Polytechnic (1984–85) and Goldsmiths College (1985–88). In 1988 Gallaccio exhibited in the Damien Hirst-curated &quot;Freeze&quot; exhibition, and in 1990 the Henry Bond and Sarah Lucas organised East Country Yard shows, which brought together many of the Young British Artists. Gallaccio is a professor in the Department of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

==Works==

Gallaccio is known for producing site-specific works that inhale the prescribed climate and space. She often collaborates closely with nature when selecting materials, exploring life cycles through the passage of time, memory, and loss. Much of her work uses organic materials, with fruit, vegetables and flowers all featuring in her work. Sometimes these materials undergo a change during the course of being exhibited.

In &quot;Red on Green&quot; (1992), her first solo showing at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, ten thousand rose heads placed on a bed of their stalks gradually withered as the exhibition went on. For &quot;Intensities and Surfaces&quot; (1996) Gallaccio left a thirty-two ton block of ice with a salt core in the disused pumping station at Wapping and allowed it to melt.
&quot;preserve &#x27;beauty″&quot; 1991–2003 was an artwork which Gallaccio produced as a nominee for the 2003 Turner Prize. The installation consisted of a wall of gerbera daisies pinned behind a single sheet of glass. Behind glass, the flowers recall still-life and romantic landscape paintings, as well as flower arranging and pressing.

Other works by Gallaccio include &quot;Stroke&quot; (1993) in which benches in the gallery and cardboard panels attached to the walls were covered in chocolate, 
&quot;Two Hundred Kilos of Apples Tied to a Barren Apple Tree&quot;, Atelier Amden, Amden, Switzerland (1999) and &quot;Because Nothing has Changed&quot; (2000), a bronze sculpture of a tree adorned with porcelain apples. &quot;Because I Could Not Stop&quot; (2002) is a similar bronze tree but with real apples which are left to rot.

&quot;Red on Green&quot; was recreated ten years later for the exhibition &quot;Blast to Freeze: British Art in the 20th Century&quot; mounted by Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg in 2002–2003 and for the 2004 British Council exhibition &quot;Turning Points: 20th Century British Sculpture&quot;.

In &quot;Stoke&quot; (2004), Gallaccio coated an old farm building at Edinburgh&#x27;s Jupiter Artland with almost 90 pounds of 70 percent cocoa, confectioner-quality chocolate. The work invited visitors to lick, touch, and stroke the walls.

2005 saw the publication of &quot;Anya Gallaccio: Silver Seed&quot; by Ridinghouse, which accompanied the artist&#x27;s exhibition commissioned by the Mount Stuart Trust for an installation at Mount Stuart on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, UK.

At Houghton Hall in Norfolk, the Marquess of Cholmondeley commissioned a folly to the east of the great house. &quot;The Sybil Hedge&quot; is an &quot;artlandish&quot; folly. It is based on the signature of the marquis&#x27; grandmother, Sybil Sassoon. Gallaccio has created a sarcophagus-like marble structure which is sited at the end of a path; and nearby is a copper-beech hedge which is planted in lines mirroring Sybil&#x27;s signature.

Commissioned for The Whitworth Art Gallery, &quot;Untitled&quot; (2016), dubbed the ‘ghost tree’, investigates themes of life, death and nature. Inspired by the removal of a decaying tree, Gallaccio worked from digital scans of the removed tree, later reproducing in ribbons of complex stainless steel plates, a monumental and reflective &#x27;ghost tree&#x27;. It has become &quot;a haunting response to loss and a timeless monument to nature.&quot;

In a 2018 interview with &quot;Ocula&quot;, Gallaccio remarked of the YBA breakout exhibition &quot;Freeze&quot;: &quot;It feels just as precarious now as it did then. And I think it is good to constantly remind myself of that and not to get complacent. The bravado and the chutzpah of &quot;Freeze&quot; was impressive; it was more about a kind of attitude and that is something that has had reverberations.&quot;

==Awards and acknowledgements==
In 2006, she was listed on the Pink Power list of 100 most influential gay and lesbian people of 2006.

In 2003, Gallaccio was shortlisted for the Turner Prize alongside Grayson Perry, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Willie Doherty. One of her pieces for the show was &quot;preserve &quot;beauty&quot;&quot;, 1991–2003, which was made from glass, fixings and 2,000 red gerberas.

<text>A spelling bee is a competition in which contestants are asked to spell a broad selection of words, usually with a varying degree of difficulty. To compete, contestants must memorize the spellings of words as written in dictionaries, and recite them accordingly.

==Etymology==
Historically, the word &quot;bee&quot; has been used to describe a get-together for communal work, like a husking bee, a quilting bee, or an apple bee. According to etymological research recorded in dictionaries, the word &quot;bee&quot; probably comes from dialectal &quot;been&quot; or &quot;bean&quot; (meaning &quot;help given by neighbors&quot;), which came from Middle English &quot;bene&quot; (meaning &quot;prayer&quot;, &quot;boon&quot; and &quot;extra service by a tenant to his lord&quot;).

==History==

The earliest known evidence of the phrase &quot;spelling bee&quot; in print dates back to 1850, although an earlier name, &quot;spelling match&quot;, has been traced back to 1808. A key impetus for the contests was Noah Webster&#x27;s spelling books. First published in 1786 and known colloquially as &quot;The Blue-backed Speller&quot;, Webster&#x27;s spelling books were an essential part of the curriculum of all elementary school children in the United States for five generations. Now the key reference for the contests is &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot;.

Spelling bees became widespread across the United States during the 19th century as a way to motivate students to learn standardized spelling. They were usually held in individual schools and towns, and were not nationally organized. In 1908, the National Education Association (NEA) held what it called the first national spelling bee at its convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Marie Bolden, a girl from Cleveland, was named champion.

The annual United States National Spelling Bee was started in 1925 by &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot;. The winner was Frank Neuhauser, age 11, who won the 1st National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C. in 1925.

In the US, spelling bees are annually held from local levels up to the level of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, which awards a cash prize to the winner. The National Spelling Bee is sponsored by English-language newspapers and educational foundations; it is also broadcast on ESPN. Since 2006, the National Spelling Bee&#x27;s championship rounds have been broadcast on ABC live. In 2005, contestants came from the Bahamas, Jamaica, Canada, and New Zealand, as well as the United States (including territories and overseas military bases). This was the first year that spellers from Canada and New Zealand attended the competition. The final authority for words is the &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot;. The annual study list is available from Scripps, either online or in print.

The National Senior Spelling Bee started in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1996. 

While most countries and continents have their own spelling bees, there are also a few global Spelling Bees such as ISB Spelling Bee International, which has participation from across the world.

Holding spelling bees in English, with its irregular spelling, makes more sense than in languages that have much more consistent spelling. Some languages, like Hindi, Italian, German, and Turkish, have highly phonetic writing systems, with a virtually one-to-one ratio of letters to sound, which makes word spelling predictable; therefore, there are very few spelling bees in these languages.

==In English==

===Africa===

In Ghana, The Spelling Bee Ghana is organized annually, with the winners being flown to the US to represent Ghana at the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

Nigeria&#x27;s spelling bee is called the Nigeria Spelling Bee, and is organized by the Bee Spelling Competition Initiative in states across the federation of Nigeria.

Many other African countries are also part of the African Spelling Bee.

==== Nigeria ====
The Nigeria Spelling Bee is organized in across states of the federation with national finalists drawn after qualifying from their respective states and either of the six geo-political zones of the country.

The Nigeria Spelling Bee which is the widest spelling bee competition in the country has so far been conducted in more than 25 states across Nigeria by the organizers (Bee Spelling Competition Initiative) which has been endorsed by the Federal Ministry of Education, Ministry of Culture and the state ministries of education.

Winners of the Nigeria Spelling Bee competition win up to ₦1,000,000 in scholarship and participate in the annual African Spelling Bee which is a continental event organized by the African Spelling Bee Consortium as the official Nigerian delegates.

This is referring to the New Era Foundation spelling Bee, an annual event in Lagos State that had its first outing in 2001.The spelling bee competition is held among all public primary and secondary school in Lagos State with the winner and runner-ups of the secondary school category carting away prizes ranging from cash, a trip to Finland and the most outstanding one being the opportunity for the overall winner to serve as one-day governor of the state alongside runner-ups as cabinet members. The spelling bee competition has till date produced 20 one-day governors with the year 2020 winner being a female student from Angus Memorial Senior High School, Shomolu Lagos - Miss Jemimah Marcus.

===Asia===

In Asia, a spelling bee is being conducted up to the international level by MaRRS Spelling Bee. The competition involves learning the correct spelling of words, their use in sentences and in multiple contexts. Currently, it is being held in India, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Bahrain, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm-Al-Quwain.

=== Australia ===
In Western Australia, a spelling bee is held by the State Library Foundation of Western Australia, for children in school years five, six, seven, and eight. The early stages of the competition are held online, and the final spell-off in front of a live audience. Two major prizes are awarded: one for a Junior Winner (Years 5–6) and the other for a Senior Winner (Years 7–8). Further prizes are given to the teacher and school class of each major prize winner, and to the most improved speller each week.

=== Bangladesh ===
Starting in 2012, Bangladesh&#x27;s English daily newspaper, &quot;The Daily Star&quot; and e-Learning portal Champs21.com have been organizing a televised spelling bee on Channel i for the students of class six to ten from Bengali and English medium backgrounds, who compete through their schools and the Champs21 website. The spelling bee team visits 7 divisional cities (Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Khulna &amp; Barisal) to test top 1% speller and top 96 speller of the season participate in the television show. The competition is the first such arrangement in Bangladesh. The champion is rewarded with a trip to Washington, DC. The winners of season 2 met the honorable president of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh Advocate Abdul Hamid. The fourth season was held in 2016.

=== India ===
The India Spelling Bee is held for school students across the country, featuring school-level, state and regional-level, and national-level competitions. The contest focuses on commonly used but misspelled words for students. It also organizes corporate and institutional contests.

=== Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas ===
Different companies/schools organize and participate in different, independent spelling bees, but the largest company in Latin America to organize annual international spelling bees since 2015 is Advanced Methods Corporation (Amco), a U.S.-based company that promotes learning English as a second language. Schools from Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Chile, Honduras, and El Salvador enrolled to the Amco system are eligible to participate in the annual Amco Spelling Bee, consisting of 3 stages: school (selection of students to participate in the regional, repeats with the next stages), regional, and international. The international one is always set in Guadalajara, Jalisco, in Expo Guadalajara, and is almost always held in the last days of May or beginnings of June.

===United Kingdom===
In 1876 there were newspaper reports of spelling bees in a number of towns in the United Kingdom. Since 2009, &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper has run a spelling bee for schools: &quot;The Times&quot; Spelling Bee.

===Vanuatu===
One of the first spelling bee competitions in Vanuatu took place in August 2019. Six primary schools and 36 students on the main island of Vanuatu participated and competed for secondary school scholarships. The SHEFA education office and Peace Corps Volunteers collaborated to make the spelling bee possible.

<doc id="237737" wikidata="Q1783416" url="?curid=237737" title="Leading-edge extension">
<text>A leading-edge extension (LEX) is a small extension to an aircraft wing surface, forward of the leading edge. The primary reason for adding an extension is to improve the airflow at high angles of attack and low airspeeds, to improve handling and delay the stall. A dog tooth can also improve airflow and reduce drag at higher speeds.

==Leading-edge slat==
A leading-edge slat is an aerodynamic surface running spanwise just ahead of the wing leading edge. It creates a leading edge slot between the slat and wing which directs air over the wing surface, helping to maintain smooth airflow at low speeds and high angles of attack. This delays the stall, allowing the aircraft to fly at a higher angle of attack. Slats may be made fixed, or retractable in normal flight to minimize drag.

==Dogtooth extension==

A dogtooth is a small, sharp zig-zag break in the leading edge of a wing. It is usually used on a swept wing, to generate a vortex flow field to prevent separated flow from progressing outboard at high angle of attack. The effect is the same as a wing fence. It can also be used on straight wings in a drooped leading edge arrangement.

Many high-performance aircraft use the dogtooth design, which induces a vortex over the wing to control boundary layer spanwise extension, increasing lift and improving resistance to stall. Some of the best-known uses of the dogtooth are in the stabilizer of the F-15 Eagle and the wings of the F-4 Phantom II, F/A-18 Super Hornet, CF-105 Arrow, F-8 Crusader, and the Ilyushin Il-62. Where the dogtooth is added as an afterthought, as for example on the Hawker Hunter and some variants of the Quest Kodiak, the dogtooth is created by adding an extension to the outer section of the leading edge.

==Leading-edge cuff==
A leading edge cuff (or wing cuff) is a fixed aerodynamic device employed on fixed-wing aircraft to introduce a sharp discontinuity in the leading edge of the wing in the same way as a dogtooth. It also typically has a slightly drooped leading edge to improve low-speed characteristics.

==Leading-edge root extension==

A leading-edge root extension (LERX) is a small fillet, typically roughly triangular in shape, running forward from the leading edge of the wing root to a point along the fuselage. These are often called simply leading-edge extensions (LEX), although they are not the only kind. To avoid ambiguity, this article uses the term LERX.

On a modern fighter aircraft, LERXes induce controlled airflow over the wing at high angles of attack, so delaying the stall and consequent loss of lift. In cruising flight, the effect of the LERX is minimal. However, at high angles of attack, as often encountered in a dogfight or during takeoff and landing, the LERX generates a high-speed vortex that attaches to the top of the wing. The vortex action maintains the attachment of the airflow to the upper-wing surface well past the normal stall point at which the airflow separates from the wing surface, thus sustaining lift at very high angles.

LERX were first used on the Northrop F-5 &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot; which flew in 1959, and have since become commonplace on many combat aircraft. The F/A-18 Hornet has especially large examples, as does the Sukhoi Su-27 and the CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder. The Su-27 LERX help make some advanced maneuvers possible, such as the Pugachev&#x27;s Cobra, the Cobra Turn and the Kulbit.

A long, narrow sideways extension to the fuselage, attached in this position, is an example of a chine.

==Leading-edge vortex controller==
Leading-edge vortex controller (LEVCON) systems are a continuation of leading-edge root extension (LERX) technology, but with actuation that allows the leading edge vortices to be modified without adjusting the aircraft&#x27;s attitude. Otherwise they operate on the same principles as the LERX system to create lift augmenting leading edge vortices during high angle of attack flight.

This system has been incorporated in the Russian Sukhoi Su-57 and Indian HAL LCA Navy.

The LEVCONs actuation ability also improves its performance over the LERX system in other areas.
When combined with the thrust vectoring controller (TVC), the aircraft controllability at extreme angles of attack is further increased, which assists in stunts which require supermaneuverability such as Pugachev&#x27;s Cobra. Additionally, on the Sukhoi Su-57 the LEVCON system is used for increased departure-resistance in the event of TVC failure at a post-stall attitude. It can also be used for trimming the aircraft, and optimizing the lift to drag ratio during cruise.

<text>Gilbert John Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto, (; 9 July 18451 March 1914), known as Viscount Melgund by courtesy from 1859 to 1891, was a British peer and politician who served as Governor General of Canada from 1898 to 1904, and Viceroy of India from 1905 to 1910.

==Early life and career==
Minto was born in London, the son of William Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 3rd Earl of Minto, and Emma, daughter of General Sir Thomas Hislop, 1st Baronet. After the death of his grandfather in 1859 he became known by the courtesy title of Viscount Melgund. After completing his education at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, he was commissioned a Lieutenant in the Scots Guards in 1867, but left in 1870. He joined the 1st Roxburghshire Mounted Rifle Volunteer Corps as a captain in 1872. In 1874, in the capacity of a newspaper correspondent, he witnessed the operations of the Carlists in Spain; he took service with the Turkish army in the war with Russia in 1877 and served under Lord Roberts in the second Afghan War (1878–1879), having narrowly escaped accompanying Sir Louis Cavagnari on his fatal mission to Kabul.

He acted as private secretary to Lord Roberts during his mission to the Cape in 1881, and was with the army occupying Egypt in 1882, thus furthering his military career and his experience of colonial administration. He was promoted Major in 1882. He was military secretary to the Marquess of Lansdowne during his governor-generalship of Canada from 1883 to 1885, and lived in Canada with his wife, Mary Caroline Grey, sister of Lord Grey, Governor General from 1904 to 1911, whom he had married in Britain on 28 July 1883. On this first Canadian visit, he was very active in raising a Canadian volunteer force to serve with the British Army in the Sudan Campaign of 1884. He served as Chief of Staff to General Middleton in the Riel Rebellion of 1885. When he was offered command of the North-West Mounted Police, he decided instead to pursue a political career in Britain. On his departure home to Britain, Canadian Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald apparently said to him, &quot;I shall not live to see it, but some day Canada will welcome you back as Governor General&quot;.

His political aspirations were checked with his defeat in the 1886 general election, where he stood as the Conservative candidate for Hexham. He then applied himself with great enthusiasm to promoting a volunteer army in Britain. In 1888 he was promoted colonel on assuming command of the South of Scotland Brigade. He resigned his commission in 1889. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s earldom in 1891, becoming The Earl of Minto.

==Governor General of Canada==
Macdonald&#x27;s prediction came true when Minto was named Governor General of Canada in the summer of 1898, having campaigned for the post after he learned of the retirement of Lord Aberdeen. Sir Wilfrid Laurier wrote that Lord Minto &quot;took his duties to heart&quot; and a review of his life reveals an energetic man who welcomed many challenges and responsibilities.

Lord Minto&#x27;s term of office was marked by a period of strong nationalism which saw economic growth coupled with massive immigration to Canada. Relations with the United States were strained as border and fishing disputes continued to create problems between the two countries.

In September 1901, after Queen Victoria&#x27;s death in January, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later to become King George V and Queen Mary) visited Canada, and travelled with Lady Minto to western Canada and the Klondike. Following the tour, Minto recommended Thomas Shaughnessy, President of the Canadian Pacific Railway, to the government at Westminster, via the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for a knighthood, as recognition for his service to the Duke and Duchess of York. Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, to whom Shaughnessy was no friend, opposed the idea; but, Minto made the recommendation anyway, invoking the ire of Laurier and prompting the Prime Minister to draft a policy dictating that all Canadian nominees for honours must be approved by the prime minister before the list was sent to London.

On 6 December 1901, Lord Minto held a skating party on the Ottawa River, when Andrew George Blair&#x27;s daughter Bessie, and potential rescuer Henry Albert Harper both drowned.

Lord Minto, like his predecessors, travelled throughout the young country—he crossed Quebec, Ontario and western Canada, visiting former battlegrounds where he had served during the North-West Rebellion. He rode throughout western Canada with the North-West Mounted Police, and enjoyed the Quebec countryside on horseback.

Lord Minto&#x27;s convictions about the importance of preserving Canadian heritage led to the creation of the National Archives of Canada.

Lord and Lady Minto were sports enthusiasts and the Minto Skating Club, which they founded in 1903, has produced many famous ice skaters. They both excelled at the sport and hosted many lively skating parties during their time at Rideau Hall. In the summer, the Minto family loved to bicycle and play lacrosse. In 1901, Lord Minto donated the Minto Cup and appointed trustees to oversee its annual awarding to the champion senior men&#x27;s lacrosse team of Canada (since 1937 the Cup has been awarded to the junior men&#x27;s champions). He loved the outdoors, championed the conservation of natural resources and promoted the creation of national parks.

In education and health, Lord Minto encouraged a forward-looking approach. He believed that Canada&#x27;s progress depended on the cultivation of patriotism and unity, and this conviction was reflected in his desire to see a wider history curriculum developed in Canadian schools. In response to the health crisis posed by tuberculosis, he helped establish the first anti-tuberculosis foundation in Canada.

Lord Minto also took great interest in the development of the Canadian military and emphasized the need for training and professional development. He was appointed honorary Lieutenant-Colonel of the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards Regiment on 1 December 1898 and was subsequently appointed Honorary Colonel, a tradition that has continued with the post of Governors General to this day.

He was appointed a Privy Counsellor on 11 August 1902, following an announcement of the King&#x27;s intention to make this appointment in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published in June.

On his trip back to Britain in 1904, having finished his term as Canada&#x27;s Governor General, Lord Minto wrote in his journal &quot;... so our life in Canada is over and it has been a great wrench parting from so many friends and leaving a country which I love, and which has been very full of interest to me&quot;.

==Viceroy and Governor General of India==
In 1905, following the resignation of Lord Curzon of Kedleston, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto, was appointed Viceroy and Governor-General of India. He served in this role until 1910, following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, the first Lord Minto. During his tenure, Lord Minto faced significant political challenges and introduced notable reforms.

One of the most significant reforms during his tenure was the Indian Councils Act of 1909, commonly known as the Morley-Minto Reforms. These reforms were a collaborative effort between John Morley, the Secretary of State for India, and Lord Minto. The reforms aimed to introduce a limited form of self-governance by expanding the legislative councils and allowing for greater Indian representation. This move was a response to the growing Indian nationalist movement and demands for political participation. John Morley famously argued that “Reforms may not save the Raj, but if they don’t, nothing else will.” In response, Minto expressed his belief in the resilience of British rule, stating, “The Raj will not disappear in India as long as the British race remains what it is, because we shall fight for the Raj as hard as we have ever fought, if it comes to fighting, and we shall win as we have always won.”

Lord Minto’s tenure was also marked by significant political unrest and the rise of revolutionary activities. The Partition of Bengal in 1905, which divided the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas, was a particularly controversial decision. This move led to widespread protests and was eventually reversed in 1911. Additionally, on November 15, 1909, two bombs were hurled at Lord Minto and his wife near Raipur Gate of Ahmedabad, although they were not harmed in the attack.

For his lifetime of service, Lord Minto was made a Knight Companion of the Garter. He was succeeded by Lord Hardinge of Penshurst in 1910. The Morley-Minto Reforms laid the groundwork for future constitutional developments in India, representing a step towards greater Indian participation in governance, although they were also criticized for being too limited.

==Marriage==
He married, on 28 July 1883, Lady Mary Caroline Grey, daughter of Charles Grey and Caroline Eliza Farquhar. She was the sister of Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, Sybil Beauclerk, Duchess of St Albans, Louisa McDonnell, Countess of Antrim and Lady Victoria Dawnay. They had five children:

* Lady Eileen Nina Evelyn Sibell Elliot (13 December 188429 May 1938), married Lord Francis Montagu Douglas Scott (son of the 6th Duke of Buccleuch and Lady Louisa Hamilton), and had issue;
* Lady Ruby Florence Mary Elliot (26 September 18865 November 1961), married Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer, and had issue;
* Lady Violet Mary Elliot (28 May 18893 January 1965), married, firstly, Lord Charles Petty-Fitzmaurice, and had issue, secondly, John Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever, and had issue;
* Victor Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 5th Earl of Minto (12 February 189111 January 1975);
* The Honourable Gavin William Esmond Elliot (25 April 18956 August 1917; killed in action).

==Legacy==

The Earl of Minto&#x27;s popularity in Canada outlived him. In addition to a Minto Place in Rockcliffe, Ottawa and Minto Street in Vancouver and the SS &quot;Minto&quot;, a famous steamer on the Arrow Lakes, the gold-mining company town of Minto City in the Bridge River Country, established 1936, was named in honour of the Earl. Also named for the Earl was Mount Minto in the Atlin District of far northern British Columbia, the town of Minto, Ontario. In addition, Minto, New Brunswick was renamed in memory of him. The Earl of Minto and Lady Minto appeared on the obverse of the Canadian four-dollar bill in the 1900 and 1902 versions of this denomination. Indirectly, the town of Minto, North Dakota in the United States is named for Minto, Ontario, whence its settlers came.

Minto Park in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), India, commemorates him. The school from which Aligarh Muslim University evolved was named behind him as Minto Circle after his generous funding for the construction of the new school buildings.

Minto Road, an area where most of the ministers of Bangladesh government have their official residence, is named after Lord Minto.

Minto Hospital and Minto Park (now officially renamed but popularly still known as such) in Lahore were also named after him.

Minto Ophthalmic Hospital in Bangalore is also named after him. It is the oldest eye hospitals in India and one of the largest and busiest eye hospitals in the country.

<doc id="237743" wikidata="Q7797051" url="?curid=237743" title="Thousand Islands – Frontenac Arch">
<text>The Thousand Islands – Frontenac Arch region or the Frontenac Axis is an exposed strip of Precambrian rock in Canada and the United States that links the Canadian Shield from Algonquin Park with the Adirondack Mountain region in New York, an extension of the Laurentian Mountains of Québec. The Algonquin to Adirondacks region, which includes the Frontenac Axis or Arch, is a critical linkage for biodiversity and resilience, and one with important conservation potential. The axis separates the St. Lawrence Lowlands and the Great Lakes Lowlands. It has many distinctive plant and animal species. It is one of four ecoregions of the Mixedwood Plains.

The Thousand Islands in the Saint Lawrence River have a distinctive flora and fauna and are a part of the biological corridor.

==Geology==
The bedrock is mostly gneiss, granite, and marble, more than a billion years old. The Frontenac terrain is the youngest of the Ontario portions of the arch, dated at 1.2 billion years old. These rocks were once part of a large mountain chain of the ancient supercontinent of Rodinia. There is also a meteor crater near Holleford, where the shield meets the limestone plains of southeastern Ontario.

==Ecology==
The area is distinctive for having tree species typically found further south, and reaching their northern limits. One example is pitch pine (&quot;Pinus rigida&quot;). Shallow soils and recurring fire have also produced unusual fire barren communities. These provide habitat for rare plants, such as bear oak (&quot;Quercus ilicifolia&quot;) and deerberry (&quot;Vaccinium stamineum&quot;), as well as rare animals, such as the five-lined skink (&quot;Plestiodon fasciatus&quot;) and gray rat snake (&quot;Pantherophis spiloides&quot;). There is high bird diversity, including the cerulean warbler, considered nationally endangered owing to the destruction of forests. Although the most important factor producing the fauna and flora is likely the bed rock, the moderating effect of the Great Lakes may also be factor. Also, some northern species extend their range south, drawn by the rugged granite landscapes of the Canadian Shield.

The basic ecosystem type of the area is temperate deciduous forest. The area has a long history of logging, which has depleted these forests of larger trees. Settlement tends to have occurred in the areas of deeper soil, and fire has particularly influenced the uplands. Reference to the forest descriptions of early surveyors has documented decline in species such as hemlock, which were preferentially removed for leather tanning. Criteria for restoring these forests have been established, and include increased tree size, spring ephemeral abundance, and coarse woody debris. Pollen cores from Lanark County provide information about longer term trends in forest cover.

There is a wide array of wetlands, ranging from larger marshes along the St. Lawrence river, to smaller marshes and bogs along water courses, and large numbers of beaver ponds. The cycles in vegetation in beaver ponds contribute to further wetland diversity; depending upon the amount of beaver activity, there may be open water, marsh, wet meadows or shrub thickets. Some lakes in the area, such as Bob&#x27;s Lake, also support uncommon species of turtles, such as the map turtles and Blanding&#x27;s turtles. Where there is marble bedrock, or other sources of calcium, fens may arise. These often have unusual calcium dependent wetland plants.

A southern portion of this region was designated a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2002, the Frontenac Arch Biosphere Reserve. Within this biosphere reserve is the relatively small St. Lawrence Islands National Park. Although it is small, it has many Frontenac Arch species mentioned above, including deerberry, Blanding&#x27;s turtle, and five-lined skinks. Further north, there is still a large gap in the ecological link to Algonquin Park. In this gap are smaller parks such as Frontenac Provincial Park and Bon Echo Provincial Park.

<doc id="237744" wikidata="Q3359167" url="?curid=237744" title="Vortex generator">
<text>A vortex generator (VG) is an aerodynamic device, consisting of a small usually attached to a lifting surface (or airfoil, such as an aircraft wing) or a rotor blade of a wind turbine. VGs may also be attached to some part of an aerodynamic vehicle such as an aircraft fuselage or a car. When the airfoil or the body is in motion relative to the air, the VG creates a vortex, which, by removing some part of the slow-moving boundary layer in contact with the airfoil surface, delays local flow separation and aerodynamic stalling, thereby improving the effectiveness of wings and control surfaces, such as flaps, elevators, ailerons, and rudders.

==Method of operation==
Vortex generators are most often used to delay flow separation. To accomplish this they are often placed on the external surfaces of vehicles and wind turbine blades. On both aircraft and wind turbine blades they are usually installed quite close to the leading edge of the aerofoil in order to maintain steady airflow over the control surfaces at the trailing edge. VGs are typically rectangular or triangular, about as tall as the local boundary layer, and run in spanwise lines usually near the thickest part of the wing. They can be seen on the wings and vertical tails of many airliners.

Vortex generators are positioned obliquely so that they have an angle of attack with respect to the local airflow in order to create a tip vortex which draws energetic, rapidly moving outside air into the slow-moving boundary layer in contact with the surface. A turbulent boundary layer is less likely to separate than a laminar one, and is therefore desirable to ensure effectiveness of trailing-edge control surfaces. Vortex generators are used to trigger this transition. Other devices such as vortilons, leading-edge extensions, and leading-edge cuffs, also delay flow separation at high angles of attack by re-energizing the boundary layer.

Examples of aircraft which use VGs include the ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk and Symphony SA-160. For swept-wing transonic designs, VGs alleviate potential shock-stall problems (e.g., Harrier, Blackburn Buccaneer, Gloster Javelin).

==Aftermarket installation==
Many aircraft carry vane vortex generators from time of manufacture, but there are also aftermarket suppliers who sell VG kits to improve the STOL performance of some light aircraft. Aftermarket suppliers claim (i) that VGs lower stall speed and reduce take-off and landing speeds, and (ii) that VGs increase the effectiveness of ailerons, elevators and rudders, thereby improving controllability and safety at low speeds. For home-built and experimental kitplanes, VGs are cheap, cost-effective and can be installed quickly; but for certified aircraft installations, certification costs can be high, making the modification a relatively expensive process.

Owners fit aftermarket VGs primarily to gain benefits at low speeds, but a downside is that such VGs may reduce cruise speed slightly. In tests performed on a Cessna 182 and a Piper PA-28-235 Cherokee, independent reviewers have documented a loss of cruise speed of . However, these losses are relatively minor, since an aircraft wing at high speed has a small angle of attack, thereby reducing VG drag to a minimum.

Owners have reported that on the ground, it can be harder to clear snow and ice from wing surfaces with VGs than from a smooth wing, but VGs are not generally prone to inflight icing as they reside within the boundary layer of airflow. VGs may also have sharp edges which can tear the fabric of airframe covers and may thus require special covers to be made.

For twin-engined aircraft, manufacturers claim that VGs reduce single-engine control speed (Vmca), increase zero fuel and gross weight, improve the effectiveness of ailerons and rudder, provide a smoother ride in turbulence and make the aircraft a more stable instrument platform.

==Increase in maximum takeoff weight==
Some VG kits available for light twin-engine airplanes may allow an increase in maximum takeoff weight. The maximum takeoff weight of a twin-engine airplane is determined by structural requirements and single-engine climb performance requirements (which are lower for a lower stall speed). For many light twin-engine airplanes, the single-engine climb performance requirements determine a lower maximum weight rather than the structural requirements. Consequently, anything that can be done to improve the single-engine-inoperative climb performance will bring about an increase in maximum takeoff weight.

In the US from 1945 until 1991,
the one-engine-inoperative climb requirement for multi-engine airplanes with a maximum takeoff weight of or less was as follows:

where formula_1 is the stalling speed in the landing configuration in miles per hour.

Installation of vortex generators can usually bring about a slight reduction in stalling speed of an airplane and therefore reduce the required one-engine-inoperative climb performance. The reduced requirement for climb performance allows an increase in maximum takeoff weight, at least up to the maximum weight allowed by structural requirements. An increase in maximum weight allowed by structural requirements can usually be achieved by specifying a maximum zero fuel weight or, if a maximum zero fuel weight is already specified as one of the airplane&#x27;s limitations, by specifying a new higher maximum zero fuel weight. For these reasons, vortex generator kits for many light twin-engine airplanes are accompanied by a reduction in maximum zero fuel weight and an increase in maximum takeoff weight.

The one-engine-inoperative rate-of-climb requirement does not apply to single-engine airplanes, so gains in the maximum takeoff weight (based on stall speed or structural considerations) are less significant compared to those for 1945–1991 twins.

After 1991, the airworthiness certification requirements in the USA specify the one-engine-inoperative climb requirement as a gradient independent of stalling speed, so there is less opportunity for vortex generators to increase the maximum takeoff weight of multi-engine airplanes whose certification basis is FAR 23 at amendment 23-42 or later.

==Maximum landing weight==
Because the landing weights of most light aircraft are determined by structural considerations and not by stall speed, most VG kits increase only the takeoff weight and not the landing weight. Any increase in landing weight would require either structural modifications or re-testing the aircraft at the higher landing weight to demonstrate that the certification requirements are still met. However, after a lengthy flight, sufficient fuel may have been used, thereby bringing the aircraft back below the permitted maximum landing weight.

==Aircraft noise reduction==
Vortex generators have been used on the wing underside of Airbus A320 family aircraft to reduce noise generated by airflow over circular pressure equalisation vents for the fuel tanks. Lufthansa claims a noise reduction of up to 2 dB can thus be achieved.

<text>TASER (also variously &quot;Taser&quot; or &quot;taser&quot;) is a brand of conducted energy device (CED) primarily used to incapacitate people by delivering an intense electric shock that briefly disrupts voluntary control of the muscles, allowing the person to be approached and handled without resistance. The brand-name product, sold by Axon (formerly TASER International), is a handheld device which fires two small barbed darts intended to puncture the skin and remain attached to the target until removed by the user of the device. The darts are connected to the main unit by thin wires that achieve a high dielectric strength and durability given the extremely high-voltage electric current they conduct (typically 50,000 volts, or 2,000 volts under load), which can be delivered in short-duration pulses from a core of copper wire in the main unit. This enormous rush of current into the body produces effects ranging from localized pain to strong involuntary long muscle contractions, causing &quot;neuromuscular incapacitation&quot; (NMI), based on the mode of use (tasing frequency and environmental factors) and connectivity of the darts. When successfully used, the target is said to have been &quot;tased&quot;.

The first TASER conducted energy weapon was introduced in 1993 as a less-lethal option for police to use to subdue belligerent or fleeing suspects, who might otherwise need to be subdued with more lethal means such as firearms. , according to one study, over 15,000 law enforcement and military agencies around the world used TASERs as part of their use of force continuum. In the United States, TASERs are marketed as less-lethal (as opposed to non-lethal), since the possibility of serious injury or death still exists whenever the weapon is deployed. At least 49 people died in 2018 after being shocked by police with a TASER. Personal-use TASERs are marketed in the US but prohibited in Canada, where there is a categorical ban on all conducted energy weapons such as stun guns and TASERs, except for use by law enforcement.

A 2009 report by the Police Executive Research Forum in the United States found that police officer injuries dropped by 76% in large law enforcement agencies that deployed TASER devices in the first decade of the 21st century compared with those that did not use them at all. Axon and its CEO Rick Smith have claimed that unspecified &quot;police surveys&quot; show that the device has &quot;saved 75,000 lives through 2011&quot;. A more recent academic study suggested police use of conducted energy weapons in the United States was less risky to police officers than hands-on tactics, and showed officer injury rates equal to those experienced by officers using alternative incapacitation methods such as pepper spray.
== History ==
TASERs have a long history of use to prevent the escape of dangerous suspects without needing to resort to lethal force, or used to capture suspects without risking serious injuries to either the officer or the suspect. A United States patent by Kunio Shimizu titled &quot;Arrest device&quot; filed in 1966 describes an electrical discharge gun with a projectile connected to a wire with a pair of electrode needles for skin attachment.

Jack Cover, a NASA researcher, began developing the first TASER in 1969. By 1974, Cover had completed the device, which he named TASER, using a loose acronym inspired by the title of the 1911 novel &quot;Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle&quot;, a book written by the Stratemeyer Syndicate under the pseudonym Victor Appleton and featuring Cover&#x27;s childhood hero, Tom Swift. The name made sense, given that the TASER delivers an electric shock. This was also done on the pattern of laser, as both a TASER and a laser fire a &quot;beam&quot; of energy at an object.

The first TASER model that was offered for sale, called the TASER Public Defender, used gunpowder as its propellant, which led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to classify it as a firearm in 1976.

Former TASER International CEO Patrick Smith testified in a TASER-related lawsuit that the catalyst for the development of the device was the &quot;shooting death of two of his high school acquaintances&quot; by a &quot;guy with a legally licensed gun who lost his temper&quot;. The two decedents, Todd Bogers and Cory Holmes, died in 1991 not 1990 as Smith has claimed. Family members and friends of the two state that Smith was not friends with them, as Smith has claimed, and they were never &quot;football teammates&quot;, as Smith has claimed. The two graduated before Smith attended Chaparral High School. Family members of the two have criticized his use of their deaths for profit.

In 1993, Rick Smith and his brother Thomas founded the original company, TASER, and began to investigate what they called &quot;safer use of force option[s] for citizens and law enforcement&quot;. At their Scottsdale, Arizona, facilities, the brothers worked with Cover to develop a &quot;non-firearm TASER electronic control device&quot;. The 1994 Air TASER Model 34000 conducted energy device had an &quot;anti-felon identification (AFID) system&quot; to prevent the likelihood that the device would be used by criminals; upon use, it released many small pieces of paper containing the serial number of the TASER device. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) stated that the Air TASER conducted energy device was not a firearm.

In 1999, TASER International developed an &quot;ergonomically handgun-shaped device called the Advanced TASER M-series systems&quot;, which used a &quot;patented neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI) technology&quot;. In May 2003, TASER International released a new weapon called the TASER X26 conducted energy device, which used &quot;shaped pulse technology&quot;. On July 27, 2009, TASER International released a new type of TASER device called the X3, which can fire three shots before reloading. It holds three new type cartridges, which are much thinner than the previous model. On April 5, 2017, TASER announced that it was rebranding itself as Axon to reflect its expanded business into body cameras and software. In 2018, TASER 7 conducted energy device was released, the seventh generation of TASER devices from Axon.

== Function ==

A TASER device fires two small dart-like electrodes, which stay connected to the main unit by thin insulated copper wire as they are propelled by small compressed nitrogen charges. The cartridge contains a pair of electrodes and propellant for a single shot and is replaced after each use. Once fired the probes travel at per second, spread apart for every they travel, and must land at least apart from each other to complete the circuit and channel an electric pulse into the target&#x27;s body. They deliver a modulated electric current designed to disrupt voluntary control of muscles, causing &quot;neuromuscular incapacitation&quot;. The effects of a TASER device may only be localized pain or strong involuntary long muscle contractions, based on the mode of use, connectivity and location of the darts on the body. The TASER device is marketed as &quot;less-lethal&quot;, since the possibility of serious injury or death exists whenever the weapon is deployed.

There are a number of cartridges designated by range, with the maximum at . Cartridges available to non-law enforcement consumers are limited to . Practically speaking, police officers must generally be within to use a Taser, though the X26&#x27;s probes can travel as far as 35feet.

The electrodes are pointed to penetrate clothing and barbed to prevent removal once in place. The original TASER device probes unspool the wire from the cartridge, causing a yaw effect before the dart stabilizes, which made it difficult to penetrate thick clothing. Newer versions (X26, C2) use a &quot;shaped pulse&quot; that increases effectiveness in the presence of barriers.

The TASER 7 conducted energy device is a two-shot device with increased reliability over legacy products. The conductive wires spool from the dart when the TASER 7 conducted energy device is fired, instead of spooling from the TASER cartridge which increases stability while in flight and therefore increases accuracy. The spiral darts fly straighter and faster with nearly twice the kinetic energy for better connection to the target and penetration through thicker clothing. The body of the dart breaks away to allow for containment at tough angles. TASER 7 has a 93% increased probe spread at close range, where 85% of deployments occur, according to agency reports. Rapid arc technology with adaptive cross-connection helps enable full incapacitation even at close range. TASER 7 wirelessly connects to the Axon network, allowing for easier updates and inventory management.

A TASER device may provide a safety benefit to police officers. The use of a TASER device has a greater deployment range than batons, pepper spray, or empty hand techniques. This allows police to maintain a greater distance. A 2008 study of use-of-force incidents by the Calgary Police Service conducted by the Canadian Police Research Centre found that the use of the TASER device resulted in fewer injuries than the use of batons or empty hand techniques. The study found that only pepper spray was a safer intervention option.

A typical TASER device can operate with a peak voltage of 50 kilovolts (1200 Volts to the body), an electric current of 1.9 milliamps, at for example 19 100 microsecond pulses per second. A supplier quotes a current of 3-4 milliamps.

== Models ==
As of September 30, 2024, Axon has three main models of TASER conducted electrical weapons (CEWs) available for law enforcement use but not necessarily civilian use. Civilians, however, have access to the TASER Pulse, which runs at a 30 second cycle once fired to allow the victim the opportunity to escape.

The TASER X26P device is a single-shot CEW that is the smallest, most compact SMART WEAPON of all four Axon models.  

The TASER X2 device is a two-shot TASER CEW with a warning arc and dual lasers. The warning arc is a function the officer can utilize with the push of a button to intimidate an aggressor, warn a potential assailant, and gain compliance of a suspect without having to deploy the loaded cartridges. During the warning arc mode, the TASER CEW will display an arc of electricity at the front of the device.

The TASER 7 device is the second newest of all four CEWs. It is a two-shot device with spiral darts that spool from the dart allowing the probes to fly straighter. The TASER 7 device&#x27;s rapid arc technology with adaptive cross connections allows for full incapacitation. The TASER 7 CEW connects wirelessly to the Axon Evidence network that includes inventory management capabilities among other things.

The TASER 10 device was officially announced by Axon on January 24, 2023. The TASER 10 was dubbed the &quot;less-lethal weapon of its era&quot; by Axon. In addition to the functions of the TASER 7, the TASER 10 features an increased probe distance of up to 45 feet, waterproof capabilities, increased probe velocity (205 feet per second), and ability to deploy the probes individually allowing the officer to create their own &quot;spread&quot; unlike previous models, which relied heavily on precise aiming of the prongs at a fixed angle with the assistance of two lasers.

== Lethality ==
As with all less-lethal weapons, use of the TASER system is never risk-free. Sharp metal projectiles and electricity are in use, so misuse or abuse of the weapon increases the likelihood that serious injury or death may occur. In addition, the manufacturer has identified other risk factors that may increase the risks of use. Children, pregnant women, the elderly, and very thin individuals are considered at higher risk. Persons with known medical problems, such as heart disease, history of seizure, or have a pacemaker are also at greater risk. Axon also warns that repeated, extended, or continuous exposure to the weapon is not safe. Because of this, the Police Executive Research Forum says that total exposure should not exceed 15 seconds.

There are other circumstances that pose higher secondary risks of serious injury or death, including:

* Uncontrolled falls or subjects falling from elevated positions
* Persons running on hard or rough surfaces, like asphalt
* Persons operating machinery or conveyances (cars, motorcycles, bikes, skateboards)
* Places where explosive or flammable substances are present
* Tasers can ignite gasoline and hand sanitizer

Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. said in 2020 that &quot;under Georgia law, a taser is considered as a deadly weapon.&quot; A 2012 study published in the American Heart Association&#x27;s journal &quot;Circulation&quot; found that Tasers can cause &quot;ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest and even death&quot;. In 2014, NAACP State Conference President Scot X. Esdaile and the Connecticut NAACP argued that Tasers cause lethal results. Reuters reported that more than 1,000 people shocked with a Taser by police died through the end of 2018, nearly all of them since the early 2000s. At least 49 people died in the US in 2018 after being shocked by police with a Taser.

== Drive Stun capability ==
Some TASER device models, particularly those used by police departments, also have a &quot;Drive Stun&quot; capability, where the TASER device is held against the target without firing the projectiles, and is intended to cause pain without incapacitating the target. &quot;Drive Stun&quot; is &quot;the process of using the EMD (Electro Muscular Disruption) weapon as a pain compliance technique. This is done by activating the TASER [device] and placing it against an individual&#x27;s body. This can be done without an air cartridge in place or after an air cartridge has been deployed.&quot;

Guidelines released in 2011 by the U.S. Department of Justice recommend that use of Drive Stun as a pain compliance technique be avoided. The guidelines were issued by a joint committee of the Police Executive Research Forum and the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. The guidelines state &quot;Using the CEW to achieve pain compliance may have limited effectiveness and, when used repeatedly, may even exacerbate the situation by inducing rage in the subject.&quot;

A study of U.S. police and sheriff departments found that 29.6% of the jurisdictions allowed the use of Drive Stun for gaining compliance in a passive resistance arrest scenario, with no physical contact between the officer and the subject. For a scenario that also includes non-violent physical contact, this number is 65.2%.

A Las Vegas police document says &quot;The Drive Stun causes significant localized pain in the area touched by the TASER [CEW], but does not have a significant effect on the central nervous system. The Drive Stun does not incapacitate a subject but may assist in taking a subject into custody.&quot; The UCLA Taser incident and the University of Florida Taser incident involved university police officers using their TASER device&#x27;s &quot;Drive Stun&quot; capability (referred to as a &quot;contact tase&quot; in the University of Florida Offense Report).

Amnesty International has expressed particular concern about Drive Stun, noting that &quot;the potential to use TASERs in drive-stun mode—where they are used as &#x27;pain compliance&#x27; tools when individuals are already effectively in custody—and the capacity to inflict multiple and prolonged shocks, renders the weapons inherently open to abuse.&quot;

== Users ==
According to a 2011 study by the United States Department of Justice&#x27;s National Institute of Justice entitled &quot;Police Use of Force, TASERs and Other Less-Lethal Weapons&quot;, over 15,000 law enforcement and military agencies around the world used TASER devices as part of their use of force continuum. Just as the number of agencies deploying TASER conducted energy weapons has continued to increase each year, so too the number of TASER device related &quot;incidents&quot; between law enforcement officers and suspects has been on the rise.

== Excited delirium syndrome==
Some of the deaths associated with TASER devices have been blamed on excited delirium, a controversial medical diagnosis that supposedly involves extreme agitation and aggressiveness. It has typically been diagnosed postmortem in young adult black males who were physically restrained by law enforcement at the time of death. The diagnosis was supported by the American College of Emergency Physicians from 2009 to 2023 and the National Association of Medical Examiners until 2023.

Excited delirium is thought to involve delirium, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, speech disturbances, disorientation, violent and bizarre behavior, insensitivity to pain, elevated body temperature, and increased strength. Excited delirium is associated with sudden death (usually via cardiac or respiratory arrest), particularly following the use of physical control measures, including police restraint and TASER devices. Excited delirium is most commonly diagnosed in male subjects with a history of serious mental illness or acute or chronic drug abuse, particularly stimulant drugs such as cocaine. Alcohol withdrawal or head trauma may also contribute to the condition.

The diagnosis of excited delirium has been controversial. Excited delirium has been listed as a cause of death by some medical examiners for several years, mainly as a diagnosis of exclusion established on autopsy. Additionally, academic discussion of excited delirium has been largely confined to forensic science literature, providing limited documentation about patients that survive the condition. These circumstances have led some civil liberties groups to question the cause of death diagnosis, claiming that excited delirium has been used to &quot;excuse and exonerate&quot; law enforcement authorities following the death of detained subjects, a possible &quot;conspiracy or cover-up for brutality&quot; when restraining agitated individuals. Also contributing to the controversy is the role of TASER device use in excited delirium deaths.

Excited delirium is not found in the current version of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;. The term excited delirium was accepted by the National Association of Medical Examiners and the American College of Emergency Physicians, who argued in a 2009 white paper that excited delirium may be described by several codes within the ICD-9. In 2017, investigative reporters from Reuters reported that three of the 19 members of the 2009 task force were paid consultants for Axon, the manufacturer of Tasers.

== Usage worldwide ==

=== Australia ===
Tasers are prohibited for civilian ownership in Australia in every state and territory. A weapons permit is required to purchase and own a taser.

=== Canada ===
Only members of law enforcement are allowed to own a taser legally. However, according to an article by The Globe and Mail, many Canadians illegally purchase tasers from the US, where they are legal.

===China===
Under the Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the Control of Firearms and Public Security Punishment Law, tasers are prohibited for civilian ownership in China without an application for a state licence. A weapons permit is required to purchase and own a taser.

=== Germany ===
Since April 2008, tasers can be legally purchased by persons 18 and older, but can only be carried by persons with a firearm carry permit (), which is only issued under very restricted conditions.

In 2001, Germany approved a pilot project allowing individual states to issue tasers to their SEK teams (police tactical units); by 2018, 13 out of 16 states had done so. A number of states have also provided a limited number of tasers to their general police forces. Some states, such as Berlin, have use of force guidelines that only permit taser use where firearm use would also be justified.

The &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; (German armed forces) does not issue tasers nor are they used in training.

=== Ireland ===
Under the Firearms Act of 1925, tasers, pepper spray and stun guns are illegal to possess or purchase in Ireland, even with a valid firearms certificate.

=== Jamaica ===
Tasers are legal for civilians to own, provided they possess a valid permit under the Customs Act. Currently, police in Jamaica do not have access to tasers, but in February 2021, Corporal James Rohan, Chairman of the Police Federation, requested access to non-lethal weaponry in order to deal more effectively with encounters with mentally ill individuals.

===Japan===
Under the Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law, import, carrying, purchase and use of stun guns or tasers is prohibited in Japan.

=== Poland ===
Any electroshock weapon, including stun guns and tasers, with amperage under 10 mA can be purchased by anyone over the age of 18 without permit or background checks. As most tasers fulfil those criteria, they are widely available in self-defence stores.

===Russia===
Stun guns and tasers made in Russia can be purchased for self-defense without special permission, however, under the Federal Law No. 150 &quot;On Weapons&quot; of the Russian Federation it&#x27;s illegal to import and subsequent sale of any foreign stun devices or tasers into the country. The ban has been in place since the first version of the law was approved in 1996.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Tasers are classified as weapons under Federal Law No. 3 of 2009, and therefore require a valid license to own or import.

=== South Korea ===
Adopted and used since 2004 by Korean National Police.

=== United Kingdom ===
Tasers have been in use by UK police forces since 2001, and they require 18 hours of initial training, followed by six hours of annual top-up training, in order for a police officer to be allowed to carry and use one. Members of the general public are not allowed to own tasers, with possession or sale of a taser punishable by up to 10 years in prison. As of September 2019, 30,548 (19%) of police officers were trained to use tasers. Tasers were deployed 23,000 times from March 2018 to March 2019, compared to only 10,000 times in 2013; however the UK police definition of &quot;deployed&quot; means that the weapon has been drawn; in the majority of cases it will not have been fired. In March 2020, extra funding was provided to purchase devices to allow more than 8,000 extra British police officers to carry a taser.

== Use on children ==
There has been considerable controversy over the use of Taser devices on children and in schools.

=== Criminal use ===
The earliest known case of a taser being used on a child was on June 10, 1991, when one was used to incapacitate an 11-year-old girl in order to kidnap her. According to Jaycee Dugard, whenever she tried to escape, her kidnapper threatened to use the taser again.

=== Police use ===
In 2004, the parents of a 6-year-old boy in Miami sued the Miami-Dade County Police department for firing a Taser device at their child. The police said the boy was threatening to injure his own leg with a shard of glass, and said that using the device was the safest option to prevent the boy from injuring himself. The boy&#x27;s mother told CNN that the three officers involved probably found it easier not to reason with her child. In the same county two weeks later, a 12-year-old girl skipping school and drinking alcohol was tased while she was running from police. The Miami-Dade County Police reported that the girl had started to run into traffic and that the Taser device was deployed to stop her from being hit by cars or causing an automobile accident. In March 2008, an 11-year-old girl was subdued with a Taser device. In March 2009, a 15-year-old boy in Michigan died from alcohol-induced excited delirium coupled with application of an electromuscular disruption device.

Police claim that the use of TASER conducted energy weapons on smaller subjects and elderly subjects is safer than alternative methods of subduing suspects, alleging that striking them or falling on them will cause much more injury than a TASER device, because the device is designed to only cause the contraction of muscles. Critics counter that TASER devices may interact with pre-existing medical complications such as medications, and may even contribute to someone&#x27;s death as a result. Critics also suggest that using a Taser conducted electrical weapon on a minor, particularly a young child, is effectively cruel and abusive punishment, or unnecessary.

In May 2023, in Cooma, NSW, Australia, police tasered a 95-yr old dementia patient from less than away after apparently giving up on negotiations with her to drop the knife she was holding. At the time, she was standing upright &amp; holding onto her 4-wheel walker. She survived the incident, but succumbed to head injuries sustained in the subsequent fall and died a week later. Her Estate sued the NSW Government, and, in April 2024, the accused &amp; suspended police officer plead not guilty to manslaughter &amp; remains free on bail awaiting trial.

== Excessive use by law enforcement ==
In 2019, two Oklahoma police officers used Tasers over 50 times on an unarmed man resulting in death. Both officers were later convicted of second-degree murder. In January 2023, Los Angeles Police Department officers tasered a teacher at least 6 times resulting in the man&#x27;s death. In 2014, Catasauqua, PA police officers inflicted serious injuries on a man, during a DUI arrest, when they tasered him eleven times while he was handcuffed and restrained in the back of a police vehicle.

A New York Times study published in 2025 collected Taser log documents from 36 police departments in Mississippi from 2020 through 2024. Data collection was incomplete, since several departments submitted no data or only partial data. The study identified 44,000 incidents in which one or more Tasers were triggered for at least one second each over the course of an hour. Reporters manually reviewed the nearly 1,000 cases that lasted at least 15 seconds. Once training operations were eliminated, the review found 611 incidents that lasted at least 15 seconds (the maximum shock duration per encounter recommended under national standards). In addition to 44 allegations of &quot;Taser abuse over the past decade from lawsuits and department records&quot;, the Times reporters found hundreds more &quot;incidents that raise red flags by examining Taser logs across the state&quot;. Cases described in the article include 11 people who were shocked while they were pinned down or handcuffed, such as Vivian Burks, an unarmed 65-year-old great-grandmother accused of marijuana use who was shocked 4 times in under one minute, and Keith Murriel, who died after being shocked at least 40 times for refusal to leave a hotel parking lot.

== Use on non-human subjects ==
Tasers are used to immobilize wildlife for research, relocation, or treatment. Since they are classified as a form of torture, it is more common to use tranquilizer darts.

== Use in torture ==
A report from a meeting of the United Nations Committee Against Torture states that &quot;The Committee was worried that the use of TASER X26 weapons, provoking extreme pain, constituted a form of torture, and that in certain cases it could also cause death, as shown by several reliable studies and by certain cases that had happened after practical use.&quot; Amnesty International has also raised extensive concerns about the use of other electro-shock devices by American police and in American prisons, as they can be (and according to Amnesty International, sometimes are) used to inflict cruel pain on individuals.

In response to the claims that the pain inflicted by the use of the TASER device could potentially constitute torture, Tom Smith, the Chairman of the TASER Board, stated that the U.N. is &quot;out of touch&quot; with the needs of modern policing and asserted that &quot;Pepper spray goes on for hours and hours, hitting someone with a baton breaks limbs, shooting someone with a firearm causes permanent damage, even punching and kicking—the intent of those tools is to inflict pain, ... with the TASER device, the intent is not to inflict pain; it&#x27;s to end the confrontation. When it&#x27;s over, it&#x27;s over.&quot;

<text>Gaius Verres ( 114 – 43 BC) was a Roman magistrate, notorious for his misgovernment of Sicily. His extortion of local farmers and plundering of temples led to his prosecution by Cicero, whose accusations were so devastating that his defence advocate could only recommend that Verres should leave the country. Cicero&#x27;s prosecution speeches were later published as the &quot;Verrines&quot;.

==Biography==
Gaius Verres was born around 114 BC.

===Public career===
During Sulla&#x27;s Civil War, Verres deserted the government faction of Gaius Marius and Carbo and went over to Sulla. Sulla made him a present of land at Beneventum and secured him against punishment for embezzlement. In 80 BC, Verres served on the staff of Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella, governor of Cilicia. According to Cicero, the governor and his subordinate both ruthlessly plundered the province. In 78 BC Dolabella had to stand trial at Rome accused of extortion and was found guilty with the evidence of Verres, who had secured a pardon.

In 74 BC, by lavish use of bribes, Verres secured a praetorship. He abused his authority to further the political ends of his party. As a reward, the Senate sent him as governor (&quot;propraetor&quot;) to Sicily, the breadbasket of the Roman Republic – a particularly rich province thanks to its central position in the Mediterranean making it a commercial crossroads. The people were for the most part prosperous and contented, but under Verres the island experienced more misery and desolation than during the time of the First Punic War or the recent Servile Wars. Verres ruined the wheat-growers and the revenue collectors by exorbitant imposts or by the iniquitous canceling of contracts. He robbed temples (notably that on the site of the Cathedral of Syracuse) and private houses of their works of art, and disregarded the rights of Roman citizens.

Another major charge leveled against Verres during his Sicilian tenure alleged that, during the time of the Third Servile War against Spartacus, he had used the emergency to raise cash. He would, allegedly, pick key slaves of wealthy landowners and charge them with plotting to join Spartacus&#x27; revolt or otherwise causing sedition in the province. Having done so, he would sentence the slave to death by crucifixion, and then lay a broad hint that a sizable bribe from the slave&#x27;s owner could expunge the charge and sentence. At other times he would name nonexistent slaves, charging that the landowner held a slave suspected of plotting rebellion and that the owner was actively hiding him. When the owner could not produce the fictitious person, Verres would throw the putative owner into prison until a bribe could be paid for his release.

He was also criticized for his public relationship with Tertia, which was regarded as scandalous, and Chelidon, who was attributed undue influence upon his office by his detractors.

Verres returned to Rome in 70 BC, and in the same year, at the request of the Sicilians, Marcus Tullius Cicero prosecuted him: Cicero later published the prosecution speeches as the &quot;Verrine Orations&quot;. Verres entrusted his defence to the most eminent of Roman advocates, Quintus Hortensius, and he had the sympathy and support of several of the leading Roman patricians.

===Trial and exile===
The court was composed exclusively of senators, some of whom may have been his friends. However, the presiding judge, the city praetor, Manius Acilius Glabrio, was a thoroughly honest man, and his assessors were at least not accessible to bribery. Verres vainly tried to get the trial postponed until 69 BC when his friend Marcus Caecilius Metellus would be the presiding judge. Hortensius tried two successive tactics to delay the trial. The first was trying to sideline Verres&#x27; prosecution by hoping to get a prosecution of a former governor of Bithynia to take precedence. When that failed, the defense then looked to procedural delays (and gaming the usual format of a Roman extortion trial) until after a lengthy and upcoming round of public holidays, after which there would be scarce time for the trial to continue before Glabrio&#x27;s term was up and the new and more malleable judge would be installed. However, in August, Cicero opened the case and vowed to short-circuit the plans by taking advantage of an opportunity to change the format of the trial to bring evidence and witnesses up much sooner, and opened his case with a short and blistering speech.

The effect of the first brief speech was so overwhelming that Hortensius refused to reply, and recommended his client leave the country. Before the expiration of the nine days allowed for the prosecution Verres was on his way to exile. There he lived until 43 BC, when he was proscribed by Mark Antony, apparently for refusing to surrender some art treasures that Antony coveted.

Verres may have had a more decent character than that with which Cicero, the primary source of information, credits him, but there is no evidence to counter the allegation that he stood preeminent among the worst specimens of Roman provincial governors. Of the seven Verrine orations collectively called &quot;In Verrem&quot;, only two were delivered; the remaining five were compiled from the depositions of witnesses and published after Verres&#x27; flight.

<text>Manius Acilius Glabrio was a Roman statesman and general, grandson of the jurist Publius Mucius Scaevola.

When Glabrio was serving as urban praetor in 70 BC, he presided over the trial of Verres. In 67 he was consul together with Gaius Calpurnius Piso. The two consuls proposed the &quot;Lex Acilia Calpurnia&quot; against bribery during canvassing for elections.

In the same year Manius Acilius was appointed to replace Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was unable to control his soldiers, as proconsul of Cilicia and the command of the Third Mithridatic War against Mithradates VI of Pontus and Tigranes the Great of Armenia. While he was on his way to Pontus Mithridates won back almost all his kingdom and caused havoc in Cappadocia, which was allied with Rome and which had been left undefended. Manius Acilius did not march on Cappadocia nor Pontus but delayed in Bithynia. The &quot;lex Manilia&quot; proposed by the plebeian tribune Gaius Manilius gave the command of the war to Pompey, who replaced Acilius. Little else is known of Manius Acilius except that he declared in favor of capital punishment for the Catilinarian conspirators.

<text>Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (101 BC – c. 43 BC) was a Roman senator and the father-in-law of Julius Caesar through his daughter Calpurnia. He was reportedly a follower of a school of Epicureanism that had been modified to befit politicians, as Epicureanism itself favoured withdrawal from politics. Piso was consul in the year 58 BC with Aulus Gabinius as his colleague.

== Biography ==
Caesar mentions his father-in-law in his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;. Piso&#x27;s grandfather, also named Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, was killed with Lucius Cassius Longinus in 107 BC by the same Tigurini that Caesar conquered the year of Piso&#x27;s consulship. As Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law, when Cicero was faced with exile later that year for having violated the &quot;Leges Clodiae&quot; by executing members of the Catiline conspiracy without a formal trial, Piso declined to protect Cicero from the threat and consequences of exile, earning the enmity of that orator. In response, Cicero attacked Piso both during and after his subsequent administration of the province of Macedonia, which he administered from 57 BC to the beginning of 55 BC, when he was recalled and replaced by Quintus Ancharius. Piso&#x27;s recall was perhaps in consequence of the violent attack made upon him by Cicero in the Senate in his speech &quot;De provinciis consularibus&quot;.

On his return, Piso addressed the Senate in his defence; Cicero replied with coarse and exaggerated invective, a writing and/or oratory style or genre in classical times, in a speech known as &quot;In Pisonem&quot;. Piso issued a pamphlet by way of rejoinder, and there the matter ended. Cicero may have been afraid to bring the father-in-law of Julius Caesar to trial. At any rate, Piso&#x27;s repute was solid enough that he was elected, though reluctant, to the office of censor in 50 BC.

At the outbreak of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, Piso offered his services as mediator. However, when Caesar marched upon Rome, Piso left the city by way of protest of Caesar. After the murder of Caesar, Piso insisted on the provisions of Caesar&#x27;s will being strictly carried out, and after the assassination Dictator was given a public funeral. In the growing tension between Mark Antony and Octavianus, Piso played a role neutral to both parties, yet seeking some form of resolution between the two sides. At the Senate session held that 1 August he offered a proposal to bring harmony between the two, but not one man supported him.

As armed strife between the soldiers of the two sides increased, Piso continued to work for peace. When the Senate opened the year 43 BC with debating over Cicero&#x27;s motion to declare Antony an enemy of the state, Piso twice intervened over the legality of such an act, arguing for compromise. Still hoping for peace, Piso joined two consular Senators -- Lucius Marcius Philippus and Servius Sulpicius Rufus—in an embassy to Antony at his camp in Mutina later that month. Piso and Philippus returned the following month—Sulpicius had died on the journey—to present terms from Antony that enraged Cicero. Antony&#x27;s terms were rejected and the Senate declared a state of war. However, events in the further East alarmed the party at Rome, and a second embassy was sent to Antony in March, which included Piso. He is not heard of after this, and Syme concludes from this silence he died not long after.

== Patronage ==
According to Ronald Syme, Piso &quot;united loyalty to Roman standards of conduct to a lively appreciation of the literature and philosophy of Hellas.&quot; The author Philodemus was one of those whom he sponsored.

Piso is believed to have been the owner of the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum.

== Family ==
According to Asconius, Piso&#x27;s wife was the daughter of one Rutilius Nudus. In addition to the daughter who married Julius Caesar, Piso also had a son, Lucius Calpurnius Piso, known as &quot;the Pontifex&quot;, consul in 15 BC.

== Legacy ==
The maxim &quot;fiat justitia ruat caelum&quot; (&quot;let justice be done, though the heavens fall&quot;), used by Lord Mansfield in Somerset&#x27;s Case and in reversing the outlawry of John Wilkes, and in the alternate form &quot;fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus&quot; by Ferdinand of Habsburg, is sometimes attributed to Piso Caesoninus (more often to Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso), but this is disputed.

<text>Long Point is a sand spit and medium-sized hamlet on the north shore of Lake Erie, part of Norfolk County in the province of Ontario, Canada.

It is about long and is about across at its widest point. Lake Erie lies to the south of Long Point, and Long Point Bay lies on the north side. The bay is subdivided into the Inner Bay and Outer Bay by a line that runs between Turkey Point to the north and Pottahawk Point to the south. Some of the towns along the bay&#x27;s north shore include Port Rowan, Turkey Point and Port Dover. Long Point is north of and across the lake from Presque Isle and Erie, Pennsylvania.

==History==
Settlers from Europe began arriving in this area in 1790. After the American Revolution, many Loyalists began to settle here but after 1796, land was given to anyone who was capable of developing it. The first lighthouse was built in 1830.
In the 19th century, a powerful storm cut an opening through the middle of Long Point. A lighthouse was built alongside the channel, which was the first of several on the point. The opening became known as &quot;The Old Cut&quot;. The cut has since closed along the lakeshore, but boaters continue to use the northern portion to reach the bay, homes and cottages.

During the mid-19th century some of local residents saw an opportunity to make easy money by &quot;blackbirding.&quot; Blackbirders erected fake lighthouses during times of low visibility. Ships trying to enter the old cut would run aground. When the crew abandoned ship the blackbirders would loot the ship of cargo and other valuables. With law enforcement based in London, Ontario, these blackbirders would store their loot on the many hiding spots that Long Point offered.

Abigail Becker on several occasions in the 19th century waded into stormy waters to save crew members of boats that had run aground. Long Point has caused many shipwrecks, with many of the wrecks located right off the tip of the point. More than 400 ships have sunk in an area called &quot;The Lake Erie Quadrangle&quot;.

Sport hunting was important after the Long Point Company purchased the Point in 1866 to facilitate this pursuit. Long Point Provincial Park was created in May 1921; by 1929, it was connected to the mainland by a new causeway.

==Economy and recreation==
The year-round population of Long Point is about 450 people, but the population increases in summer months when cottagers and campers visit. Long Point is popular destination for boating, swimming, fishing, waterfowl-hunting and canoeing, attracting between 100,000 and 300,000 visitors each year. A large portion of Long Point is owned by the Long Point Company, a private organization that does not allow the public onto its property. Because of this, most homes, cottages and business are within the first few kilometres of the causeway that carries the road between Long Point and the mainland. Long Point Provincial Park, a popular destination for day visitors and campers, is located on the peninsula

==Natural environment==
Long Point is an example of sand dune and sand-spit formation in the Great Lakes region. It is the largest erosion deposit formation in the Great Lakes, created by water-borne sediments swept eastward and deposited in part along an underwater glacial moraine. Habitats on and surrounding Long Point include woodlands, sand dunes and bluffs, marshes, ponds, meadows, beaches and lakeshore. The complex is the largest biophysical formation of its kind in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. North of the peninsula lie several islands, including Ryerson&#x27;s, Second, and Snow.

In 1982, the Long Point National Wildlife Area was recognized as a wetland of international significance under the Ramsar Convention. In 1986, Long Point Biosphere Reserve was designated as a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO and as a globally significant Important Bird Area by Bird Life International. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources classifies Long Point as a &quot;Macrosite&quot;, an area that contains numerous ecological or geological significant zones, such as Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest.

Inner Long Point Bay covers approximately between the spit and Lake Erie&#x27;s north shore. The Inner Bay is a diverse sport fishery and continentally important staging area for migratory waterfowl. Immediately adjacent to the coastal reserve is a distinctive terrestrial area of temperate &#x27;Carolinian&#x27; broadleaf forests, conifer plantations, oak savannas and diverse agro-ecosystems.

===Wildlife===
The region is an important location for bird migration in spring and autumn. It is a major staging area for a variety of waterfowl. &quot;Long Point itself is one of the most important wetland complexes for migrating waterfowl in southern Canada, and is reported to receive the highest waterfowl use (based on numbers of waterfowl days during spring and fall migration) of any area on the Great Lakes (approximately 4 million days per year). Up to 30,000 Tundra Swans pass through the area in spring, and up to 8% of the world&#x27;s Canvasbacks congregate in the area on any one day during spring and fall,&quot; according to a report by the Long Point World Biosphere Reserve.

In 1960, the Long Point Bird Observatory was established to monitor migrant birds on the point. It is North America&#x27;s oldest bird observatory. As a result of a growing national focus towards saving the birds, the organization was renamed Bird Studies Canada in 1998. Its national headquarters overlooks Long Point Inner Bay on the western limits of Port Rowan, adjacent to base of the peninsula.

The Long Point Biosphere Reserve and surrounding area is home to 1384 species of plant, 370 species of birds, 102 species of fish, 46 species of mammals, 34 species of amphibians and reptiles, and 91 species of butterflies. These include Species at Risk such as American ginseng (&quot;Panax quinquefollus&quot;), American badger (&quot;Taxidea taxus&quot;), Acadian flycatcher (&quot;Empidonax virescens&quot;) and channel darter (&quot;Percina copelandi&quot;).

==Climate==
According to the Atlas of Canada, Long point has a cool summer humid continental climate with no dry season (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). The climate of Long Point is influenced by Lake Erie, causing spring and summer temperatures to be cooler, and autumn and winter temperatures to be warmer than the adjacent mainland. Winters are relatively cool, with a mean temperature of while summers are warm, averaging . Long Point averages of precipitation per year. It is estimated that Long Point averages 2,000 hours of bright sunshine per year or 45% of possible sunshine.

<doc id="237754" wikidata="Q313664" url="?curid=237754" title="Publius Clodius Pulcher">
<text>Publius Clodius Pulcher ( – 18 January 52 BC) was a Roman politician and demagogue. A noted opponent of Cicero, he was responsible during his plebeian tribunate in 58 BC for a massive expansion of the Roman grain dole as well as Cicero&#x27;s exile from the city. Leader of one of the political mobs in the 50s, his political tactics – combining connections throughout the oligarchy with mass support from the poor plebs – made him a central player in the politics of the era.

Born to the influential patrician gens Claudia, he was embroiled early in his political career in a religious scandal which saw him develop a rivalry with the orator Cicero and become a plebeian in order to be eligible for the plebeian tribunate. He successfully stood as tribune of the plebs for 58 BC and passed six laws to restore Rome&#x27;s collegia (private guilds and fraternities), expand the grain dole (making it free rather than subsidised while also using those collegia as means for distribution), annex Cyprus to pay for the dole, clarify augural law on religious obstruction, make it more difficult for the censors to expel senators from the senate, and exile Cicero for the unlawful execution of conspirators during the Catilinarian conspiracy.

When curule aedile in 56 BC, he feuded with and attempted to prosecute his political enemy, Titus Annius Milo, who controlled a rival set of urban mobs. Starting the year an opponent of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, he and his family reconciled with them to form a political alliance. A few years later in 52 BC, amid renewed political violence and a campaign for the praetorship, Milo and Clodius encountered each other on the &quot;via Appia&quot; outside Rome, where Clodius was killed. His body, brought back to Rome, was brought to the forum and then cremated in the senate house, causing its destruction by fire.

His politics were advanced largely by his cultivation of urban mobs in Rome which, by exercising violent control of the places where the republic operated, furthered his political objectives. These violent tactics, however, were not his only sources of influence: his family connections and nobilitas made him a valuable ally to many parties – including, at various times, Caesar, Cato, and Pompey – in the ad hoc factionalism of the late republic. The older view that Clodius acted as an agent of magnates, such as Caesar or Pompey, is now rejected by scholars; he is now seen as an opportunistic and independent politician.

== Name ==
Later historians speculated that Clodius changed the spelling of his &quot;nomen&quot; from &quot;Claudius&quot; to &quot;Clodius&quot; to distance himself from his patrician family and curry favor with the plebeians; however, there are no ancient sources that substantiate the idea that he changed his name, or that the two spellings signified patrician vs. plebeian status. Ancient contemporaries like Cicero referred to him as &quot;Clodius&quot; before his plebeian adoption, and Clodius&#x27;s patrician sisters spelled the names with an O in correspondence throughout their lives. The O-spelling may have also been used by Clodius&#x27;s uncle in the 90s BC, as well as by his elder brother Gaius, as documented by Cicero.

W. Jeffrey Tatum, in the 1999 book &quot;The Patrician Tribune&quot;, also notes that Roman politicians did not benefit from reducing social distance between themselves and the plebs: rather, the plebs valued champions who were &quot;more&quot; noble because it made their causes seem more respectable.

== Early life ==
Clodius was born to the patrician gens Claudia. His branch traced its ancestry to shortly after the founding of the republic, with its ancestral patriarch Attus Clausus holding a consulship in 495 BC. The Claudii Pulchri, the branch of the family from which Clodius hailed, descended from Appius Claudius Caecus (censor in 312 BC).

Clodius&#x27; father, Appius Claudius Pulcher, was consul in 79 BC and a supporter of Sulla. Shortly after he became proconsul of Macedonia in 77 BC, he died, leaving three sons. The youngest of these sons was Publius Clodius; his two elder brothers were Appius and Gaius. He also had three sisters all named Clodia: the eldest was the wife of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer; the second daughter wed Lucius Licinius Lucullus; the third wed Quintus Marcius Rex. The identity of Clodius&#x27; mother is disputed, as is the precise relationship between the sons of father Appius and the two Metelli (Celer and Nepos).

=== Early career ===

Clodius first concretely enters the historical record serving under Lucullus, his brother-in-law, during the Third Mithridatic War. T R S Broughton, in &quot;Magistrates of the Roman republic&quot; places him possibly as a legate under Lucullus in 68 BC. During that year, he encouraged soldiers to mutiny when wintering at Nisbis in Armenia. Per Plutarch, he likely acted on personal motives, rather than as part of a Pompeian plot. The next year, he transferred to serve under the proconsul of Cilicia, Quintus Marcius Rex, who was also Clodius&#x27; brother-in-law. In command of the fleet as a prefect, he was defeated and captured. Appealing to Ptolemy, the king of Cyprus, he was ransomed from the pirates or otherwise released as a gesture of good will shortly before Pompey&#x27;s pan-Mediterranean anti-pirate campaign; Clodius, after his release, reassumed command under Pompey though formally attached to Marcius. He also served in a mission to support the Roman client king of Syria, Philip II Philoromaeus, but was unsuccessful. Exploiting his familial connections to put himself in military positions, his military career was broadly unsuccessful. However, this proved of little consequence politically as Romans usually believed that aristocrats were inherently competent at military affairs.

On Clodius&#x27; return to Rome, in 65 BC, he started an unsuccessful prosecution of Lucius Sergius Catilina. While Clodius&#x27; bête noire Cicero later claimed that Clodius cooperated with Catiline to make an incompetent prosecution (a crime called ), there is little contemporary evidence thereof. The more unbiased source Asconius, in commentaries on Cicero, dismissed the accusation; more recent historians have largely concurred. Catiline&#x27;s acquittal is sufficiently explained by bribery and deference by the jury to his many consular allies. Around the same time, Clodius also threatened Lucullus with prosecution. Lucullus responded by divorcing his wife Clodia with humiliating public allegations that she engaged in incest with Clodius. The prosecution was shortly thereafter dropped.

Clodius was possibly elected as military tribune for 64 BC. Whether military tribune or not, he served that year on the staff of then-praetor Lucius Licinius Murena who was proconsul of Transalpine Gaul in 64 BC. Nothing concrete is known of Clodius&#x27; activities there. When the two returned to Rome in 63 BC, Clodius was involved in Murena&#x27;s campaign for the consulship and likely helped distribute bribes to voters in the comitia centuriata. At the ensuing trial of Murena that year, Cicero in &quot;Pro Murena&quot; may have defended Clodius&#x27; role in Murena&#x27;s campaign and there is no evidence at all that Clodius was involved in the Catilinarian conspiracy that year. Clodius&#x27; support for Murena and his connection with Quintus Marcius Rex – who was assigned a command in Italy to suppress Catiline&#x27;s revolt – indicates that he was likely an opponent of the conspirators.

=== Bona Dea affair ===

The next year, in 62 BC, Clodius stood successfully for the quaestorship. Up to this point, Clodius&#x27; career was largely conventional. Prior, however, to his taking office, he was involved in a scandal where some time in December 62 BC he infiltrated the female-only secret rites of the Bona Dea in the house of the pontifex maximus, Julius Caesar. His motives for this are unclear and muddled by invective. The sacrilege was initially ignored. Around six months passed before a meeting of the senate in May forced the matter to be brought to the pontifices who declared it sacrilegious; the senate, following religious law, then dutifully set up a tribunal. To that end, the senate advised the consuls to pass a law to establish a special tribunal to prosecute Clodius for the crime of ; the crime, which normally covered only incest and sexual relations with Vestal Virgins, was here extended to include Clodius&#x27; sacrilege in a loose analogy with an assault on the Vestal&#x27;s chastity. To signal its importance, the senate also shut down public business until the people ratified the tribunal.

Clodius had two allies: one of the consuls, Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus, and one of the plebeian tribunes, Quintus Fufius Calenus. They argued that the law, by appointing jurors via the urban praetor rather than by lot, violated due process and constituted an illegal senatorial usurpation of the jurors&#x27; roles. Piso, as the formal proposer, opposed his own law in speeches and by shenanigans: with a mob led by Clodius&#x27; ally Gaius Scribonius Curio, Piso and his supporters seized the voting stalls and then handed out only negative ballots. After a motion in the senate to repeal the decree to establish the tribunal, brought by Curio&#x27;s homonymous father (who had been consul in 76 BC), failed 400–15, Clodius and his allies took to the streets. Amid orations connecting the senate&#x27;s tribunal to Cicero&#x27;s illegal execution of citizens just a few months earlier during the Catilinarian conspiracy, those supporting the bill eventually accepted selection by lot. Two motions dividing the matters in the senate – first whether a tribunal should be established and second whether it should have its jury appointed by the praetor – were brought. The first motion passed; the second was defeated; and a new bill, brought by tribune Fufius with the jury selected by lot, then passed in the assembly.

The prosecution at the trial was led by Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus – joined by other Cornelii Lentuli arrayed in an alliance against Clodius – and the main advocate for the defence was Curio&#x27;s father who had been consul in 76 BC. While the trial is not well documented, Clodius is alleged to have obstructed interrogation of his slaves by selling them to his brother or moving them to Gaul. Character witnesses, including Lucullus, attacked Clodius&#x27; character. Julius Caesar&#x27;s mother and sister (Aurelia and Julia) testified to Clodius&#x27; presence. Curio produced a resident of the town Interamna, who swore that Clodius was not present in Rome during the rites. Cicero contradicted this alibi, which according to Valerius Maximus was Clodius&#x27; only defence; this testimony under oath became the root of the enmity between Clodius and Cicero. Worried about violence against the jurors, the senate decreed their protection. However, after the jurors voted 31 to 25 to acquit, the decision was immediately condemned as a product of bribery.

If bribes were paid, the monies were provided by Clodius, who Cicero later claimed had almost bankrupted himself in paying them. While Marcus Licinius Crassus has been suggested as bankrolling Clodius&#x27; bribes, many scholars believe there is insufficient evidence to prove or disprove his involvement. Julius Caesar divorced his wife Pompeia in the aftermath of the trial, skilfully avoiding offending Clodius and ridding himself of the matter. Scholars are divided as to whether Clodius was involved in an affair with Pompeia: W Jeffrey Tatum rejects it as an unnecessary elaboration while John W Rich believes Caesar&#x27;s divorce indicates uncertainty as to her complicity.

=== Transitio ad plebem ===
The Bona Dea affair damaged Clodius&#x27; political aspirations. He expected to accompany the consul Piso on the latter&#x27;s proconsular governorship of Syria as quaestor; the senate, showing its anger at Piso and Clodius, revoked Piso&#x27;s assignment. Clodius eventually was assigned to a quaestorian post in Sicily under its propraetor, Gaius Vergilius Balbus, and he returned to Rome by June 60 BC after a short tour of duty. After the affair Clodius started plans to become a plebeian so to stand for the plebeian tribunate (patricians were ineligible). He attempted to effect the transfer through three serial schemes.

The first was the passage of legislation in the centuriate assembly which would reassign him to the plebs. Two of his political allies brought legislation in 60 BC to that effect on his behalf: Gaius Herrenius, then plebeian tribune, and Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, then consul. However, both bills stalled under vetos from the other plebeian tribunes, likely on political or religious grounds. On his return to the city, Clodius then underwent a &quot;sacrorum detestatio&quot; on 24 May 60 BC, a poorly understood religious rite before the comitia calata. Clodius evidently believed that this rite was sufficient to render him a plebeian; Metellus Celer, the consul, disagreed strenuously and that consular opinion was ratified by the senate after a debate in early June, ending this attempt as well.

Clodius initially opposed the strategy of having himself adopted by a plebeian and then immediately liberated from his adoptive father. But the next year, 59 BC, during the consulship of Gaius Julius Caesar and Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, an opportunity arose. After a forensic speech by Cicero which included attacks on the political alliance between Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, Caesar and Pompey immediately arranged a session of the comitia curiata to approve Clodius&#x27; adoption and emancipation by one Publius Fonteius (a twenty-year-old man who was younger than Clodius). After this political stunt from Caesar and Pompey, Cicero, suitably intimidated, withdrew to his Italian villa. With religious objections nullified by Caesar and Pompey, who were respectively pontifex maximus and augur, Clodius became plebeian and shortly thereafter stood for the plebeian tribunate.

In the aftermath of the adoption, Clodius supported Caesar and Pompey. He spoke in favour of the &quot;lex Vatinia&quot; which appointed Caesar to his Gallic command in April; he also anticipated appointment either to Caesar&#x27;s land commission or to an embassy to Ptolemy XII Auletes. When neither appointment was forthcoming, Clodius broke with his erstwhile benefactors. Seizing on their unpopularity due to their violent political tactics, Clodius declared his opposition to Caesar. Caesar attempted to rescind the adoption to prevent Clodius&#x27; tribunician election but this carried no weight; senators, even including Cicero, were pleased to see Clodius – along with Clodius&#x27; friends Curio and Metellus Nepos – draw up against Caesar. Clodius also started to move against his bête noire Cicero, but Pompey, who still maintained good relations with Clodius, interceded on Cicero&#x27;s behalf.

== Tribunate ==

At the tribunician elections of summer 59 BC (for terms from December 59 to 58), Clodius was easily successful. Between the election and the start of his term in December, the Vettius affair saw an estrangement between Pompey and Cicero; the later consular elections also saw the election of two consuls: Lucius Calpurnius Piso, Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law, and Aulus Gabinius, a longtime friend of Pompey. Clodius responded by changing tact again and, in support of Caesar and Pompey, vetoed Bibulus&#x27; customary speech when leaving the consulship.

=== Clodius&#x27; legislative programme ===
On the first day of his term as tribune, 10 December 59 BC, he announced four major pieces of legislation. Their extent and breadth indicated they had been workshopped for some time, probably starting in July 59 BC. They were the &quot;lex Clodia de collegiis&quot;, &quot;lex Clodia frumentaria&quot;, &quot;lex Clodia de obnuntiatione&quot;, and &quot;lex Clodia de censoria notione&quot;. They were to be put before the people in the new year, January 58 BC. As a whole, the legislation produced for Clodius a broadly popular base of support while also securing the support of many senators, especially the numerous but not-individually-influential pedarii.

==== Collegial law ====
The senate had prohibited a number of colleges () which included both professional associations as well as religious organisations. A few of these organisations – &quot;it is no longer reasonable to conclude that all but a few... were made illegal&quot; – were banned in 64 BC by a senatorial decree. These colleges were revived by Clodius&#x27; law and, by enrolment in a centralised recording of the whole city&#x27;s colleges, sanctioned by the state. Reviving the colleges also allowed men like Clodius and his associate Sextus Cloelius to serve as financial patrons and cultivate connections with the urban masses.

==== Grain law ====
Clodius also used the opportunity to greatly expand the grain dole. Instead of importing corn and selling it at a subsidised rate, as introduced by Gaius Gracchus, the ration of five modii would now be free for citizens at Rome. The responsibility of getting this grain to Rome was largely delegated to provincial magistrates and the expense of it imposed a heavy burden on state finances, expanding on the already expensive provisions of Marcus Porcius Cato&#x27;s enlarged grain dole in 62 BC.

The colleges reestablished in Clodius&#x27; first law may have played a role in distributing this grain, since it enrolled people eligible to receive this grain into various districts in Rome. Regardless, the free food guaranteed by the law won Clodius enduring support among the urban poor. Its burdens on the treasury, however, were huge: the senate decreed a special minting of coins just to pay for that year&#x27;s expenses. Clodius also found it possible to raise more money from the provinces, passing a law taking payment from Brogitarus of Galatia and certain Byzantine exiles to restore their statuses in their home countries; bills restoring these men would be passed through the year. More money was also to be raised from the Ptolemaic kingdom in Cyprus, which Clodius ordered seized and annexed. He initially had annexation assigned to the existing province of Cilicia: whoever would be appointed to that open proconsulship would find themselves with an extremely profitable remit.

==== Augural law ====
In the previous year, Caesar&#x27;s consular colleague Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus withdrew to his house, probably in May, to obstruct Caesar&#x27;s legislation by announcing observation of unfavourable auspices. Bibulus continuously announced that he was watching the skies and then sent messages in absentia to other magistrates reporting unfavourable omens. Such unfavourable auspices if properly reported would have stopped the holding of an assembly; because such assemblies were held anyway, Bibulus and his supporters purported such results were invalid. The validity of these obstruction tactics, however, is mostly rejected by scholars, who emphasise not only that the senate at the time dismissed these claims in multiple different debates but also that the &quot;lex Aelia et Fufia&quot; required that unfavourable omens be reported in person to the presiding official to have effect.

Clodius&#x27; augural law is not well-developed in the ancient sources. It is, however, generally agreed that Clodius&#x27; law did not rise to Cicero&#x27;s exaggerations, which claimed that the &quot;lex Aelia et Fufia&quot; were repealed. The law instead targeted the narrow question of whether Bibulus&#x27; announcement of unfavourable omens in absentia would be permissible, answering that question negatively. The possible precedent of permitting a magistrate to shut down the government through edicts issued from bed was seen by all, Bibulus&#x27; supporters included, as unacceptable: the senate rejected this position in 59 BC, did so again at a debate on Caesar&#x27;s legislation early in 58, and the people too rejected it by passing this &quot;lex Clodia&quot;. However, the bill was specifically framed to sidestep the validity of Bibulus&#x27; obnuntiations in 59: it would only apply prospectively.

==== Censorial law ====
Roman censors long had powers to remove someone from the senate by omitting that name from the list of senators. Clodius&#x27; &quot;lex de censoria notione&quot; required both censors to agree to remove someone from the senate and give cause with opportunity for a hearing. This limited the possibility that censors strip tribunes of their seats in the senate as a weapon against them. Moreover, due to the lenient census in 61 BC, there were likely fears among junior members of the senate – especially those who never held senior magistracies, the &quot;pedarii&quot;, – that censors might want to trim the senatorial rolls. This legislation, although exaggerated by Cicero into the claim that Clodius abolished the censors, was broadly popular among the numerous but individually-unimportant &quot;pedarii&quot;.

=== Passage and exile of Cicero ===
At the beginning of the year, Cicero announced his opposition and found in one of the tribunes that year – Lucius Ninnius Quadratus – an ally. In Dio&#x27;s version, Ninnius threatened a veto against all of Clodius&#x27; bills; given the impossibility of sustaining a veto against the kind of strong popular support expected for a grain bill, it is more likely Ninnius threatened only Clodius&#x27; collegial bill on the grounds that it overturned the considered decision of the senate in 64 BC. However, Clodius reached a deal with Cicero, agreeing not to pursue his feud if Cicero would call Ninnius off. This deal, reached with the support of the senatorial elite, allowed Clodius to push through his four laws on 4 January 58 BC.

The extent of popular support behind Clodius first became visible when Clodius interceded in the trial of Publius Vatinius, a Caesarian ally in 59 BC and legate recently returned from Gaul. Making his intercession evident, Clodius summoned a mob which entirely disrupted the prosecutorial proceedings, overturned the praetor&#x27;s benches, and smashed the jury&#x27;s voting urns. This first instance of popular violence and the role of the colleges in organising may have been a surprise to Clodius – there is little evidence that Clodius intended his collegial law to produce urban mobs at his beck and call – but he quickly came to capitalise on this new tactic. In February, Clodius put forward two further bills. The first would assign to the current consuls, Piso and Gabinius, to the provinces of Macedonia and Syria respectively. The second would reaffirm citizen rights to &quot;provocatio&quot; and retroactively punish any magistrate who had killed a citizen without trial, along with senators who so advised a magistrate, with exile. The latter law, the &quot;lex Clodia de capite civis Romani&quot;, was clearly targeted at Cicero. Cicero and his ally Ninnius responded by adopting mourning dress; the senate soon decreed such dress as well. The consuls, however, ignored the decree, prohibited equestrian allies of Cicero from addressing the senate, and supported the bill in public.

Clodius put his mobs on Cicero and disrupted his rallies with violence, arousing concern among the senators at large. Clodius defanged this backlash, however, by reassigning the annexation of Cyprus and restoration of Byzantine exiles to Marcus Porcius Cato – who in 63 BC was one of the most forceful supporters of executing the Catilinarian conspirators – with the title &quot;pro quaestore pro praetore&quot;. Cicero saw this as a ploy to remove Cato from the city and cause him to accept Clodius&#x27; adoption and tribunician laws, the traditional judgement among classicists. However, other classicists have instead seen the assignment as Clodius negotiating a deal or compromising with Cato and allies – signalling that Clodius had no ill-will against senators who had supported Cicero in 63 BC – therefore isolating Cicero. With Cicero rejecting a lifeline from Caesar, who offered to appoint him as one of his legates and thereby give him immunity from prosecution, Cicero withdrew from the city into exile; Clodius immediately passed a &quot;lex Clodia de exsilio Ciceronis&quot; which exiled the orator, confiscated his house on the Palatine hill to be turned into a shrine to the goddess Libertas, and prohibited the senate or people from recalling the orator.

=== Opposition to Pompey ===
The success of Clodius&#x27; four laws provided him huge political support. This support, especially with his inadvertent discovery of mob power at the prosecution of Vatinius, made it possible for him to continue as an independent political agent. Setting himself against Pompey, Clodius moved to advance his support from the senators suspicious of the general. Setting his target on Pompey&#x27;s eastern settlements, Clodius promulgated a bill to upset Pompey&#x27;s favour to Deiotarus, tetrarch of Galatia, who Pompey had appointed high priest at Pessinus; removing Deiotarus from the priest, Clodius instead elevated Brogitarus – Deiotarus&#x27; son-in-law and ruler of a separate Galatian kingdom – while also declaring Brogitarus a Roman ally. This intervention did not reshape Roman policy in the east, which would have been unacceptable for such a junior magistrate to do. But the senate was happy to see Pompey&#x27;s decisions unsettled; nor was a veto forthcoming from a tribune would be unable to find support to deny constituents their own popular sovereignty.

Clodius also kidnapped a princely hostage that Pompey had taken to Rome. The prince, the homonymous son of Tigranes II of Armenia, was taken by Clodius from the house of one of the praetors and put on a ship to Armenia. Driven back by a storm, a bloody clash between Clodius and the praetor&#x27;s retinues occurred on the &quot;via Appia&quot; which saw the praetor&#x27;s retinue defeated. After the clash, which resulted in at least one fatality, Pompey and Clodius broke politically. Pleased by Pompey&#x27;s embarrassment, the senate did nothing. Pompey&#x27;s response to Clodius relied on his ally in the consulship, Aulus Gabinius. But here, Clodius&#x27; gangs overreached when they fell on the consul&#x27;s retinue and destroyed his fasces. With Clodius formally consecrating Gabinius&#x27; property to the plebeian goddess Ceres, he clearly approved of his attack on consular authority; this was unacceptable to the political class: &quot;too severe a threat to public order&quot;; &quot;a step too far&quot;. Ninnius consecrated Clodius&#x27; property in retaliation and on the first day of June brought a bill to recall Cicero from exile that was supported unanimously in the senate but promptly vetoed. Through other men, a movement grew over the next year to lift Cicero&#x27;s exile, of which Pompey eventually took the head.

Later in the year, Clodius also signalled his support for Cato&#x27;s faction in its continuing fight against Caesar&#x27;s legislation, arguing publicly that Caesar&#x27;s laws in 59 were religiously invalid. It is likely he did so in an attempt to induce members of Cato and Bibulus&#x27; group to support him in preventing Cicero&#x27;s return. An event on 11 August 58 BC also saw one of Clodius&#x27; slaves confess to having been ordered to assassinate Pompey. Although it is not clear whether this attempt was real, Pompey, who was paranoid of attempts on his life, then shut himself in his villa. Clodius responded by having his gangs menace the villa for the rest of the year. The opposition to Clodius, led by Pompey and Cicero&#x27;s friends with their leaders either shut in at home or shut out abroad, yet continued to gain ground through the year. Eight of the ten tribunes in October brought a bill to recall Cicero together – it was again vetoed – and eventually the opposition decided to wait Clodius out since his term ended in December.

== Shifting alliances ==

=== Opposition to recalling Cicero ===
On 10 December 58 BC, Clodius returned to being a private citizen. Pompey&#x27;s allies in the tribunate promptly proposed a bill to recall Cicero; eventually, all but two of the tribunes would support the bill. In January 57 BC, the two new consuls – Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther and Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos – announced in the senate that they supported or acceded to Cicero&#x27;s return. Seeing the senate again support Cicero, one of Clodius allies in the tribunate – Sextus Atilius Serranus Gavianus – exercised a veto in the senate which continued through January. When the bill to lift Cicero&#x27;s exile came to a vote on 23 January 57 BC, two tribunes – Quintus Fabricius and Marcus Cispius – occupied the forum to prevent a veto from being raised. Clodius&#x27; gangs, strengthened by gladiators borrowed from his brother, then drove the tribunes from the forum by force; Cicero&#x27;s brother Quintus, attending to support his brother, narrowly escaped the fighting alive. Another tribune, Titus Annius Milo, had the gladiators arrested and procured confessions, but Serranus had them freed; Milo and Clodius from this point became rivals.

The political class unified against the Clodius&#x27; violent tactics on 23 January. Milo prosecuted Clodius under the &quot;lex Plautia de vi&quot; but Clodius&#x27; allies in office – Metellus Nepos as consul, Appius Claudius Pulcher as praetor, and one of the tribunes (Sextus Atilius Serranus or Quintus Numerius Rufus) – made it impossible for Clodius to be tried by reserving all days in the calendar for other business. Clodius&#x27; tactical superiority in the streets was then lost when further violence against another tribune, Publius Sestius, saw multiple politicians assemble mobs to arm themselves. Pompey, supporting Cicero, canvassed for support across Italy and procured through Spinther a senatorial decree that citizens should to assemble in Rome to vote for Cicero&#x27;s recall. By the summer, with much of Italy supporting Cicero&#x27;s recall, Clodius&#x27; last remaining tools to oppose the recall were food riots. When the senate voted on lifting Cicero&#x27;s exile in July, the measure passed 416–1 with Clodius the lone dissenter. Against such overwhelming support, Clodius&#x27; allies in the tribunate became unwilling to veto the bill as it proceeded in the senate or the senate&#x27;s later decree that anyone who blocked the bill would be declared public enemies.

On 4 August 57 BC, Clodius attempted to disrupt a public meeting where Quintus Cicero, brought by Pompey, was to speak in favour of lifting his brother&#x27;s exile. Unsuccessful, the bill passed later that day before the comitia centuriata amid a huge influx of Ciceronean supporters from across Italy. Pompey&#x27;s victory in recalling Cicero was made more complete when the senate, at Cicero&#x27;s motion, gave Pompey a command to bring food to Rome to stop the riots. Clodius and Cicero again opposed each other over Cicero&#x27;s attempt to have his Palatine house restored. Before a pontifical hearing, Clodius and Cicero spoke, with Clodius arguing that removing the shrine to liberty would offend the gods. Cicero argued successfully that Clodius&#x27; law to take his house, in failing to explicitly authorise dedication, was null and void. After Cicero&#x27;s victory before the pontiffs, Clodius first attempted to convince the public that the decree was actually in his favour before attempting to filibuster a senatorial debate on Cicero&#x27;s house. When the senatorial resolution was vetoed by Serranus after passing almost unanimously, the overwhelming senatorial response convinced Serranus to withdraw his veto. Unsuccessful lawfully, Clodius responded by mobilising his mobs to disrupt construction work on the site as well as harass Cicero, Milo, and others in the streets. Clodius&#x27; defeats were, however, largely momentary. He retained the support of eminent men such as Publius Sulla and Quintus Hortensius; the ongoing political battle over the Egyptian command would again bring Clodius into political respectability.

=== Egypt and political return ===
Ptolemy XII Auletes was deposed in 57 BC. He personally pled at Rome for intervention to restore him to the Egyptian throne. An official friend of Rome and massively in debt to many senators, Roman political and economic interests aligned to support such an expedition. Even after Ptolemy tried to have some delegates from the new Alexandrine regime assassinated, Roman support for him remained firm. The senate decreed in September 57 that the consul Spinther, who was shortly be proconsul of Cilicia and Cyprus, should restore Ptolemy; Spinther, supported publicly by Pompey and earnestly by Cicero, left in November to take up his province. The next month, however, saw renewed wrangling over who would lead the Roman response, with Pompey&#x27;s name floated, probably at his covert insistence. Pompey&#x27;s enemies in the senate therefore found new use for Clodius&#x27; anti-Pompeian agitation.

Clodius&#x27; enemies, seeing that he would almost certainly win election as aedile and therefore imminently become immune from prosecution, sought to prosecute and convict him quickly for public violence. The consul-designate Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus tried to float a prosecution in the senate but it was filibustered; Titus Milo responded by indicting Clodius and announcing that he would delay elections by obnuntiation until Clodius was prosecuted. The consul Metellus Nepos attempted to hold elections on 19 November, supported by Clodius&#x27; gangs, but Milo&#x27;s gangs won the battle and elections were postponed. The next day, Metellus Nepos attempted to sneak past Milo to the campus Martius so that Milo could not report obnuntiation in person; after Milo caught the consul sneaking on back streets and reported his bad omens, elections were again called off.

When the new tribunes came into office on 10 December, Lucius Caninius Gallus promulgated a bill to transfer Spinther&#x27;s command to Pompey. This placed Clodius&#x27; political usefulness back to the fore, especially when Clodius had a friend among the tribunes, Gaius Porcius Cato. The issue of trying Clodius was forcibly dropped around the same time: the quaestors resigned without replacement on 4 December; because they appointed the jury, there could no trial. When Marcellinus, Lucius Marcius Philippus (also consul-elect in 57 BC), and Cicero attempted to have the senate direct the praetor to appoint the jury instead, Clodius&#x27; gangs disrupted the meeting. Metellus Nepos also directed as consul that no praetor could constitute a jury without the quaestors, a bar at least until 31 December. Eventually, into the new year with the political threat of Pompey looming, the senate approved elections that returned Clodius as aedile in 56 BC.

=== Aedilate ===

Elections for the aedilate of 56 BC were late, occurring on 20 January that year. Clodius, due to his popularity, was elected first. While many expected Clodius to repeat his largesse from his tribunician term, his financial resources seemed to have been largely exhausted, with his term seeing only the customary games and public works.

The early months of 56 were again consumed by the question of the Egyptian command. Early in the same year a religious sign came when lightning hit the statue of Jupiter on the Alban mount. Clodius, as one of the &quot;quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot;, helped interpret this omen. The priests announced an oracle which warned against supporting or opposing the king of Egypt while also prohibiting the king&#x27;s restoration &quot;with a crowd&quot;. The allies of Pompey and Spinther denounced the oracle as a fraud; the senators generally, however, accepted it since it precluded both men from military glory. The debate was eventually called off without settlement after a series of complex parliamentary manoeuvres from mid-January through to early February.

Clodius, as aedile, also prosecuted Milo in February for public violence before a &quot;iudicium populi&quot;: a popular trial before the assembled people. Milo was defended in the trial by Cicero, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, and Pompey. When Pompey spoke on 7 February, the trial descended into disorder with Clodius&#x27; crowd chanting lewd slogans along with the claim that Crassus should be appointed to go to Alexandria instead of Pompey. The whole trial was then adjourned after the demonstrations became violent. The senate, in a meeting in the coming days, blamed Milo and Pompey for the disorder, which led Pompey to abandon the plan to commandeer the Egyptian expedition. Spinther, in Cilicia and warned by Cicero that consequences would be severe if he failed in restoring Ptolemy (as was his still-valid directive from August 57), chose inaction. The senate also decreed legislation should be enacted against &quot;sodalitates&quot;, a form of political organisation which Clodius&#x27; &quot;collegia&quot; evidently were not, on 10 February 56 BC. The same day, a prosecution was started by one Marcus Tullius against Clodius&#x27; enemy Publius Sestius, which Cicero and others attributed to Clodius; whether that is the case is doubted. Cicero, joined by Pompey and Crassus, spoke in defence of Sestius, which secured his acquittal. The attacks by Cicero on Caesar, however, triggered a new re-balancing: with the consul Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus opposing Caesar and the possibility of Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus being elected consul in 55 also against Caesar, Clodius&#x27; elder brother went north to treat with the Gallic proconsul, eventually producing a reconciliation between the Clodii Pulchri and the renewed First Triumvirate.

In the spring of 56, Clodius put on the Megalensian games amid food riots, which continued to embarrass Pompey&#x27;s handling of the grain supply. But the reconciliation between the Claudii and the triumvirs included a marriage between Pompey&#x27;s son and Appius&#x27; daughter (Clodius&#x27; niece): tact was quickly changed to reflect this new relationship. Attacks on Cicero, however, did not end. After a series of prodigies forced the senate to consult haruspices, Clodius with his authority as a &quot;quindecimvir sacris faciundis&quot; gave speeches blaming the deconsecration of Clodius&#x27; shrine to Libertas (Cicero&#x27;s house) for divine displeasure. Cicero responded by blaming Clodius instead. In a political pause, Cicero with the support of Milo and one of the tribunes, removed and possibly destroyed the tablets recording Clodius&#x27; legislation. This, however, was a step too far: in a meeting of the senate shortly after Cato&#x27;s return from Cyprus, few were willing to accept (especially the influential beneficiary Cato), Cicero&#x27;s position that Clodius&#x27; adoption and thus entire tribunate were invalid.

The year closed with Gaius Cato, supported by Clodius, sustaining a months-long veto on the consular elections (and thus also elections for all the junior magistracies) as part of a ploy to secure the consulship of 55 BC for Pompey and Crassus. The protection of Clodius&#x27; gangs was necessary for Gaius Cato, who was repeatedly menaced for the outrageous obstructionism. Amid these extreme political tactics, Pompey and Crassus were able by violence to secure the election of interreges in early 55 and drive, with the help of soldiers on leave from Caesar, their enemies from the consular canvass. While it is not clear whether Clodius participated in the violence that year needed to win Pompey and Crassus their desired electoral outcomes as well as the &quot;lex Trebonia&quot; that gave them provincial commands, favours from the triumvirs followed. A senatorially-sponsored embassy to the east for Clodius was funded, with Cicero&#x27;s objections sidelined by a quid pro quo, allowing Clodius to visit the eastern provinces and clients. One of the suspected destinations was Byzantium or the court of Brogitarus, who were expected to pay generously for Clodius&#x27; services in 58. Enjoying hospitality befitting a senatorial embassy and replenishing his monetary reserves in the east, Clodius was likely absent from Rome for the rest of 55.

== Death ==
=== Praetorian campaign ===
Clodius returned to Rome in 54 BC, possibly seeking a praetorship in 53. Whether Clodius actually sought the praetorship of 53 is unclear and debated, though many scholars side with Badian&#x27;s belief that a delay actually occurred. The ongoing censorship, which included many hearings for junior senators the censors wanted removed, cemented among the &quot;pedarii&quot; the fruits of Clodius&#x27; tribunate. Clodius was then involved in a series of trials against Gaius Cato and Marcus Nonius Sufenas, previous Clodian allies during their tribunates. While the sources are unclear as to whether Clodius participated in their defences, the three trials ended in acquittals. Amid further activities in the courts, Clodius won support from defendants and – according to Valerius Maximus – defended one of his prosecutors during the Bona Dea affair; these actions showed a sound mind suitable for court presidency, i.e. a praetor.

54 BC saw Clodius&#x27; elder brother Appius elected consul with Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, only for them to be thrown into a serious corruption scandal that cut across all existing loyalties. Appius (a friend of the triumvirs) joined with Domitius (an enemy thereof) to support candidates Gaius Memmius (a friend thereof) and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus (an enemy thereof) as the only nominees for the consulship of 53 in exchange for the two candidates procuring fabricated legal documents to grant the two consuls lucrative proconsular postings. When the plot became public, competing candidates Marcus Aemilius Scaurus and Marcus Valerius Messalla triggered a surge in interest rates as they borrowed to hand out bribes. Distancing himself from his brother who was at the same time helping prosecuting candidate Scaurus for corruption, Clodius defended Scaurus, which saw him speak in Scaurus&#x27; defence alongside his enemy Cicero. All four consular candidates were indicted for bribery and elections were delayed until July 53 BC. With none of the candidates withdrawing, Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus and Marcus Valerius Messalla were elected months into the consular term and found themselves with the unenviable task for arranging elections in this disturbed political environment for 52 BC.

Clodius now stood in the praetorian elections for 52 BC; letters from Cicero indicate his success was a foregone conclusion. His campaign – very uncommonly for a republican politician – included a pledge to redistribute freedmen from the four urban tribes into the 31 rural tribes, which would give them far more political power. A more poorly documented proposal, possibly to regulate the informal manumission of slaves, was also brought.

For personal and political reasons, Clodius was part of the Pompeian effort to deny Titus Annius Milo, a candidate for 52 and friend of Marcus Porcius Cato, victory in the consular elections. Clodius supported the other two candidates: Pompey&#x27;s ally Publius Plautius Hypsaeus and the blue-blooded Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio. Clodius and Milo immediately came to fighting in the streets with their mobs: Clodius attempted to ambush Milo on the &quot;via Sacra&quot; forcing Milo to flee; Milo repulsed a violent Clodian attempt to seize the voting pens; a young Mark Antony was rumoured to have volunteered to assassinate Clodius to restore order. The chaos of the street fighting, along with a persistent tribunician veto on elections from one of Pompey&#x27;s tribunician allies (Titus Munatius Plancus), made it impossible to hold elections in 53: the two consuls, entering into office seven months late, abdicated on the last day of their terms without replacement. Appointment of interreges was customary when all magistrates abdicated without replacement. Their appointment too was vetoed, on Pompey&#x27;s initiative, as Milo&#x27;s victory was clearly foreseeable. Clodius&#x27; campaign for the praetorship continued into the new year, as did the campaigns of the other candidates. Part of his campaign included a visit to Aricia, a town on the &quot;via Appia&quot;, south of Rome.

=== Encounter with Milo ===
The main source for information on Clodius&#x27; death is Quintus Asconius Pedianus&#x27; commentary on Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Pro Milone&quot;; the evidence given in Cicero&#x27;s speech itself is highly tendentious and should not be taken as a truthful accounting of events. The events as presented by Asconius are broadly as follows. While travelling back from Aricia, Clodius and Milo encountered each other some south of Rome on the &quot;via Appia&quot; near Clodius&#x27; villa in Bovillae on around 1:30 pm on 18 January 52 BC. Milo was travelling toward Lanuvium, where he was to install a priest. Both men travelled with armed entourages, but Clodius&#x27; entourage was smaller: some 26 men to Milo&#x27;s 300. After the two groups passed in silence, a fight broke out between Clodius and one of the last men in Milo&#x27;s entourage, leading to Clodius being hit in the shoulder with a javelin. In the resulting fight, Clodius&#x27; men were defeated. Clodius was carried to roadside inn, but when Milo heard that Clodius had been wounded, Milo ordered his lieutenant Marcus Saufeius to kill Clodius: Clodius was dragged out of the inn and stabbed to death. The body was discovered by a senator also travelling on the &quot;via Appia&quot;, Sextus Teidius, who had it sent to Rome; arriving at Rome around 4:30 pm, the body was brought before Clodius&#x27; widow Fulvia.

The story of Clodius&#x27; death was almost immediately muddled by partisan invective. Days after the destruction of the curia in Clodius&#x27; funeral, Milo and his allies – including his tribunician ally Marcus Caelius Rufus – claimed that Clodius had planned to ambush Milo and that the fight was lawful self-defence. This narrative was the main one spread by Milo&#x27;s defenders in the aftermath of Clodius&#x27; death and forms the core of Cicero&#x27;s legal defence in &quot;Pro Milone&quot;. Separately, it was also claimed by Clodius&#x27; enemy Marcus Porcius Cato that a senator Marcus Favonius had told Cato that Clodius had related to Favonius that Milo would shortly be dead. A negative version of this narrative also emerged, for example, from Metellus Scipio, who declared in the senate about a month after Clodius&#x27; death that Milo had planned the murder. Such narratives were compounded by the feeling among many that Milo was justified not by self-defence from a Clodian trap but also that Clodius&#x27; death was simply in the interest of the republic. A pamphlet to that effect was penned by, among others, Marcus Junius Brutus.

=== Funeral and political aftermath ===

The next morning, 19 January, two tribunes aligned with Clodius, Titus Munatius Plancus and Quintus Pompeius Rufus, held a contio in the forum lambasting Milo for the murder. The mob, at Sextus Cloelius&#x27; initiative, took Clodius&#x27; body into the curia Hostilia. There, with the senate&#x27;s furniture and records, they cremated the body. The fire spread to the rest of the building, destroying it and the nearby basilica Porcia. Milo, who had fled the city for his safety, returned on news of this excess a few days later; the destruction of this senatorial symbol reversed the public mood; he therefore continued his consular campaign.

The same day, with Pompey and late-Clodius&#x27; tribunes away burning the senate house, the senate met on the Palatine within the pomerium at the Temple of Jupiter Stator: without tribunician veto they immediately elected an interrex, Marcus Lepidus. A mob stormed his house demanding immediate elections while Milo&#x27;s chances were poor, but were refused. As Rome deteriorated into a total breakdown of law and order, the interreges were unable to hold elections; the senate met on 1 February and passed the senatus consultum ultimum, instructing the interrex and Pompey (no normal magistrates in office) to levy and bring soldiers into the city to restore order. After 12 interreges failed to hold elections, Cato and Bibulus brought a compromise, seeking Pompey to be elected as sole consul so to exclude Milo from any chance at victory. With Pompey and late-Clodius&#x27; tribunes holding off their vetoes, Pompey was elected by the comitia under interrex Servius Sulpicius Rufus&#x27; presidency.

Pompey immediately moved legislation to create a tribunal to try public violence under expedited procedures and to move against electoral corruption. When order was restored, Milo was indicted by Clodius&#x27; nephews, the sons of his elder brother Gaius. With the senate precluding the argument that Milo killed Clodius to save the republic by passing a resolution condemning the murder as &quot;contra rem publicam&quot; and in a trial atmosphere menaced by a mob, Milo was found guilty by 38–13 votes in the jury – some sources describe Cicero, Milo&#x27;s advocate, being unable to speak in the commotion – and went into exile. Milo&#x27;s lieutenant Saufeius, the man who committed the actual murder, was acquitted by one vote (26–25) later that year. Cloelius, whose idea it was to cremate Clodius in the curia, was prosecuted and convicted 46–5; the tribunes who helped were also convicted after their terms ended on 10 December 52 BC.

== Legacy ==
In the aftermath of Clodius&#x27; death, his political legacy and tactics, which combined aristocratic connections with mass support from the poorer urban plebs, influenced later politicians. Publius Cornelius Dolabella, a patrician by birth and Cicero&#x27;s son-in-law via Tullia, had himself adopted by a plebeian to stand for the tribunate, succeeding in 47 BC, and that year proposed the complete abolition of debts while raising statues of Clodius to great acclaim. However, the use of political violence in Roman politics was not novel: Clodius was not the first nor the last to assemble mobs to disrupt or support political initiatives. The grain dole which Clodius had legislated during his tribunate survived the fall of the republic and persisted through the Roman empire. Imperial self-representation as builders of public monuments as well as benefactors for freedmen and the urban plebs, &quot;perpetuat[ed] some aspect of [Clodius&#x27;] political style&quot;.

Clodius&#x27; reputation in the later ancient and modern sources is predominantly negative due to the survival of and reliance on Ciceronean invective from around 56 BC. Treatments in modern times have at various times called him &quot;a petty gangster&quot;, &quot;an irresponsible demagogue&quot;, and &quot;a demagogue of the wildest kind&quot;. Modern historiography largely viewed him as an agent of Caesar, an anarchic enigma – for Theodor Mommsen, &quot;an irrational anarchist&quot;, – or a revolutionary enemy of Cicero and the senatorial republic. Scholarship since 1966, with the publication of Erich Gruen&#x27;s &quot;P. Clodius: instrument or independent agent?&quot; has instead focused on Clodius as an independent agent attempting to play off different groupings in the late republic for personal gain. This independent agent interpretation has been praised as &quot;incisive and penetrating&quot;, especially amid the general abandonment of 19th century party-political interpretations of Roman politics.

<doc id="237757" wikidata="Q1095556" url="?curid=237757" title="North American Soccer League">
<text>The North American Soccer League (NASL) was the top-level major professional soccer league in the United States and Canada that operated from 1968 to 1984. It is considered the first soccer league to be successful on a national scale in the United States. The league final was called the Soccer Bowl from 1975 to 1983 and the Soccer Bowl Series in its final year, 1984. The league was headed by Commissioner Phil Woosnam from 1969 to 1983. The NASL laid the foundations for soccer in the United States that helped lead to the country hosting the 1994 FIFA World Cup and setting up Major League Soccer (MLS) in 1996.

The United States did not have a truly national top-flight league until the FIFA-sanctioned United Soccer Association (USA) and the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL), which had operated separately for one season in 1967, merged in December 1967 to form the NASL. The NASL considered the two pre-merge forerunner leagues as part of its history.

The league&#x27;s popularity peaked in the late 1970s. The league averaged over 13,000 fans per game in each season from 1977 to 1983, and the league&#x27;s matches were broadcast on network television from 1975 to 1980.
The league&#x27;s most prominent team was the New York Cosmos. During the mid-to-late 1970s, the Cosmos signed a number of the world&#x27;s best players —Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer, Carlos Alberto— and the Cosmos averaged over 28,000 fans per game for each season from 1977 to 1982 while having three seasons of the average attendance topping 40,000 spectators per game. Other internationally well-known players in the league included Giorgio Chinaglia, Johan Cruyff, Johan Neeskens, Gerd Müller, Bobby Moore, Eusébio, and George Best. However, over-expansion, the economic recession of the early 1980s, and disputes with the players union ultimately led to the collapse of the NASL following the 1984 season. Also, FIFA&#x27;s decision to award the hosting of the 1986 FIFA World Cup to Mexico after Colombia withdrew, rather than the U.S., is considered a factor in the NASL&#x27;s demise. Former New York Cosmos president Clive Toye called the league &quot;a magnificent success that eventually failed as a single entity. But, what it left behind is a knowledge of the game that didn&#x27;t even existed (sic) in this country before and enthusiasm for the game which never existed before.&quot;

The league additionally sanctioned indoor soccer in various tournament forms in 1971, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979 and 1983, and in a season format in 1979–80, 1980–81, 1981–82 and 1983–84.

==History==

===Founding===

The surprisingly large North American TV audience of over 1 million for the 1966 FIFA World Cup and the resulting documentary film, &quot;Goal!&quot;, led American sports investors to believe there was an untapped market for the sport in the U.S. and Canada. In 1967, two professional soccer leagues started in the United States: the FIFA-sanctioned United Soccer Association (USA), which consisted of entire European and South American teams brought to the U.S. and given local names, and the unsanctioned National Professional Soccer League (NPSL). The NPSL did not receive sanctioning by the USSFA, as it refused to pay the $25,000 fee, was branded an outlawed entity by FIFA, and players faced penalties for signing with it. While the USA had FIFA sanction, the foreign teams that were rebranded with American names for the summer 1967 season viewed the league as little more than a training exercise for their off-season, and most did not field their best players. The NPSL had a two-year national television contract in the U.S. with the CBS television network. Officials were instructed to whistle fouls and delay play to allow CBS to insert commercials. The ratings for matches were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the arrangement with CBS was soon terminated. Bill MacPhail, head of CBS Sports, attributed NPSL&#x27;s lack of TV appeal to empty stadiums with few fans, and to undistinguished foreign players who were unfamiliar to American soccer fans.

The two leagues merged on December 7, 1967, to form the North American Soccer League (NASL). NASL began the 1968 season with 17 of the 22 teams that had participated during the 1967 season, folding five redundant teams in cities where both USA and NPSL had operated. The teams relied mostly on foreign talent, including the Brazilian Vavá, one of the leading scorers of the 1958 and 1962 World Cups. International friendlies included victories against Pelé&#x27;s Santos and against English champions Manchester City.

Though the league had a few successes, it experienced significant problems gaining acceptance in the American sports community. The 17 teams included only 30 North American players. The expenses of high salaries for foreign players and renting of large stadiums, coupled with low attendances, resulted in every team losing money in 1968, and investors quickly pulled the plug after their year&#x27;s commitment ended. At the end of the year, CBS pulled its TV contract, and all but five of the teams folded. The league moved its offices to a basement of Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, and at the end of the sixteen-game 1969 season, the league declared Kansas City the league champions on the basis of most points in the round-robin, and the Baltimore Bays announced they would fold. It appeared top-tier professional soccer would not survive in North America.

Desperate to keep the league afloat, the league approached two American Soccer League teams, the Rochester Lancers and the Washington Darts about transferring to the NASL. Despite coming from the ASL (which had a nearly 40-year history as a semi-pro league), the two teams were immediately the most successful, and won their respective divisions. Rochester beat Washington in a two-game final, and the league survived.

In 1971, NASL added three teams—the New York Cosmos, Montreal Olympique, and the Toronto Metros—each of which paid a $25,000 expansion fee. The Dallas Tornado won the title after a number of multiple overtime playoff games, including a 173-minute marathon against Rochester.

Realizing it needed to sell to North Americans the sport of soccer, which was still foreign to most people, the NASL modified its game rules in an attempt to make its product more exciting, and comprehensible, to the average sports fan. These changes included the following:
*Utilizing a clock that counted game time down to zero, as was typical of other timed American sports, rather than the traditional upwards direction to 90 minutes.
*The introduction during the 1972 season of a line from the goal to determine offside calls, rather than the usual midfield line. Meant to increase scoring opportunities and reduce the frequency of defenses trapping an attacking player into an offside position, this rule allowed the attacker to no longer be offside unless he had crossed that 35-yard line. Though it was ridiculed outside the NASL, the experiment did have FIFA&#x27;s blessing until 1982.
*The implementation in 1974 of a penalty shootout to decide matches that ended in a draw. By the 1977 season the shootout was modified to somewhat resemble, in spirit at least, a penalty shot in ice hockey. The attacking player would start at the 35-yard line and attempt his shot within five seconds, but he could make as many breakaway moves as he could; likewise, the goalkeeper could take on the attacker without restriction. The format was best-of-5-kicks, with each team attempting extra rounds if the score was still tied after five rounds.
*The carryover of the NPSL&#x27;s 1967 points system, in which teams were awarded six points for a regulation (and later extra time) win, and initially three points for a draw. When the penalty shootout eliminated tie games in 1974, the winning team was awarded three points for a win rather than six; this was later reduced to one point in 1975–1976, raised to the traditional six points from 1977 to 1980, and reduced again to four points from 1981 to 1984.
**The most notable variation on the points system that was also carried over from the NPSL was awarding a team a bonus point for each goal (up to a three-goal maximum) they scored in the game, regardless of its outcome. On five occasions this nontraditional system gave the regular season title to a team other than the one with the best record; this most notably occurred in 1983, when the Cosmos, buoyed by their league-leading 87 goals, were awarded the regular season title despite having two fewer wins than the Vancouver Whitecaps.

===Interest begins to grow===
The NASL of the early 1970s was, to a large extent, a semi-pro league, with many of the players holding other jobs.
On September 3, 1973, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; featured a soccer player on its cover for the first time – Philadelphia Atoms goalkeeper Bob Rigby. SI profiled the Philadelphia Atoms&#x27; victory in the NASL championship, the first time an American expansion sports team won a title in its first season. Philadelphia averaged 11,500 fans in 1973, the first time since 1967 that any North American professional soccer team had averaged over 10,000 fans. The cover title declared &quot;Soccer Goes American&quot;, as Philadelphia had started six Americans in the championship match. Despite the &quot;Soccer Goes American&quot; title, however, in no season after 1974 did any American player win the MVP award or finish as league top scorer, as the mid-1970s saw an influx of foreign talent.
SI predicted continued success for the Philadelphia Atoms, but the Atoms dissolved in 1976.

NASL&#x27;s average attendance had grown steadily from a low of 2,930 in 1969 to 7,770 in 1974, and by 1974 four teams were averaging over 10,000 attendance. The 1974 NASL Championship game between the Los Angeles Aztecs and the Miami Toros was televised live on CBS, the first national broadcast of a pro soccer match in the United States since 1968.

The 1974 and 1975 seasons saw rapid expansion for NASL. In 1974, eight new teams paid the $75,000 franchise fee (equivalent to $ in ) and joined the league, although two existing teams folded. The 1974 expansion saw teams on the west coast, giving NASL a national presence for the first time. The west coast expansion was a success, with three of the teams – San Jose, Seattle and Vancouver – averaging over 10,000 fans in 1974. In 1975, five more franchises were added. Two of these five additions – Chicago and Hartford – were in cities that had successful franchises in Division II American Soccer League, which at the time saw itself as a potential challenger to NASL as the U.S.&#x27;s top professional soccer league. The expansions of 1974 and 1975 meant that NASL had grown from 9 teams in 1973 to 20 teams by 1975.

The 1975 season saw the signing of internationally known players, including Portuguese star Eusébio to Boston, and former England goalkeeper Peter Bonetti to St. Louis.

===Pelé and the New York Cosmos===

In 1975, the New York Cosmos created a media sensation and overnight transformed the fortunes of soccer in the United States by signing Pelé. From the moment he signed his contract at the 21 Club on June 10, 1975, in front of a crush of ecstatic worldwide media, Pelé&#x27;s every move was followed, bringing attention and credibility to soccer in America. The Cosmos&#x27; home attendance tripled in just half the season Pelé was there, and on the road the Cosmos also played in front of huge crowds that came to watch Pelé play.

Pelé&#x27;s arrival resulted in greater TV exposure for the Cosmos and for the league overall. Ten million people tuned in to watch CBS&#x27; live broadcast of Pelé&#x27;s debut match—a record American TV audience for soccer—with the Cosmos on June 15, 1975, against the Dallas Tornado at Downing Stadium in New York. CBS also televised another Cosmos match plus the 1975 Soccer Bowl championship match, and in 1976 ABC signed a contract to broadcast matches during the 1976 season. By 1976, NASL was being picked up by the mainstream media, with the sports pages of newspapers covering the league. The NASL was shown on the TVS network (a syndicated television service) during 1977 and 1978, although some games were tape delayed or not carried in certain markets.

The biggest club in the league and the organization&#x27;s bellwether was the Cosmos, who drew upwards of 40,000 fans per game at their height, during the period that older soccer superstars, like Pelé of Brazil and Franz Beckenbauer of Germany, played for the club. Although both well past their prime by this stage of their careers, the two were considered to have previously been the best attacking/offensive (Pelé) and defensive (Beckenbauer) players in the world.

Giants Stadium sold out (73,000+) their 1978 Soccer Bowl win. However, the overall average attendance of the entire league never reached 15,000, with some clubs averaging less than 5,000.

===Expansion and star players===

The Los Angeles Aztecs signed Manchester United star George Best in 1976. NASL had been trying to persuade Best to move to America and place him in a major media market, but once the New York Cosmos had signed Pelé, Los Angeles was the logical placement for Best. Best was traded to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers (a club based in the Miami area) in 1978, and in 1979 Los Angeles signed its next big star, Johan Cruyff. Cruyff was an instant success, doubling the team&#x27;s attendance, and winning the league&#x27;s MVP award.
L.A. also brought in a new head coach from 1979 to 1980, Rinus Michels, who had coached Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona, and the Dutch national team, the man credited with the invention of the Dutch playing style of &quot;Total Football&quot; in the 1970s.

The Minnesota Kicks were established in 1976 and quickly became one of the league&#x27;s more popular teams, drawing an average attendance of 23,120 fans per game in 1976 to the Metropolitan Stadium in a Minneapolis-Saint Paul suburb. The Kicks won their division four years in a row from 1976 to 1979, drawing over 23,000 fans in each of those four seasons (peaking at 32,775 in 1977).

After L.A., Cruyff then moved on to the Washington Diplomats. The Washington Diplomats had been purchased by Madison Square Garden Corp. and its chairman Sonny Werblin in October 1978. Cruyff&#x27;s presence was a huge boost, as was Wim Jansen, a midfielder who had played for the Netherlands at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. For the 1980 season, the Diplomats attendance was 19,205 spectators per match.

Despite NASL&#x27;s apparent success, of NASL&#x27;s 18 teams in 1977, six were considered franchises that needed to be relocated, bought out, or folded. A planning committee of owners issued a report recommending that NASL strengthen its existing teams, and limit expansion to two franchises for 1978, with one additional franchise per year for the following years. Despite this recommendation, NASL brought in six new teams at $3 million per team, raising the league&#x27;s teams from 18 to 24 for the 1978 season.
San Diego Sockers President Jack Daley later described NASL&#x27;s boom years of the late 1970s: &quot;It became fashionable to chase the Cosmos. Everyone had to have a Pelé. Coaches went around the world on talent searches, forcing the prices up.&quot;
The Portland Timbers tripled their team payroll from 1979 to 1980 in an effort to keep up with the league average.

The league began a college draft in 1972 in an attempt to increase the number of U.S.- and Canadian-born players in the league. The foreign image of soccer was not helped, however, by a league that brought in many older, high-profile foreign players, and frequently left Americans on the bench. This effort was often doubly futile, as while many of the foreign players were perhaps &quot;big names&quot; in their home countries, almost none of them qualified as such in North America, and they quickly absorbed most of the available payroll, such as it was, which could have otherwise been used to pay North American players better. After the 1977 season, the team owners voted to mandate an increase in the number of North American players by limiting the number of non-North American players a team was permitted to have on the field at one time and reducing the total of non-citizens on a club&#x27;s rosters to a total of 11 by 1984. As of 1979, NASL rules required that each squad start two U.S. or Canadian players—often a goalkeeper and an outside defender—and that each 17-man roster carry six native players. The U.S. had lacked sufficient quality youth soccer programs in the 1950s, resulting in the dearth of U.S.-born talent in NASL in the 1970s. NASL suffered a minor blow with a players strike at the start of the 1979 season, but the strike was honored by only one third of the players and lasted only five days.

In 1980, the minimum number of U.S. and Canadian starters was raised to three. The 1980 season was referred to as &quot;the year of the North American player&quot; with a renewed emphasis on &quot;native players.&quot; With the increased requirements for teams to field U.S. and Canadian players, demand for quality native players boomed, with Jim McAlister setting a transfer record for an American player at $200,000 (or $ in ).

With the end of the 1970s, NASL seemed poised for moderate success. The 1979 season had seen attendance increase by 8%. ABC televised several matches during the 1979 and 1980 seasons. An apparent era of stability seemed to have arrived, with the 1980 season expecting no planned expansion, relocations or failed teams among its 24 franchises, and with most rosters remaining relatively stable.

===FIFA disputes===

The NASL was often in dispute with FIFA due to its rules changes. In April 1978, FIFA threatened the United States Soccer Federation with banning NASL players from playing international games, due to the unsanctioned soccer rule changes by the NASL.

===Financial problems and contraction===

At the close of the 1980 season, NASL&#x27;s woes were beginning to mount, as NASL was feeling the effects of over-expansion, the economic recession, and disputes with the players union. In the early 1980s the U.S. economy went into the doldrums, with unemployment reaching 10.8% in 1982, its highest level since World War II. NASL&#x27;s owners, who were losing money, were not immune from the broader economy.

Perhaps most troubling of all, NASL owners were spending sums on player salaries that could not be covered by league revenue. Whereas NFL owners in 1980 were spending on average 40% of the team&#x27;s budget on player salaries, NASL owners were averaging over 70% of their budget on player salaries. The Cosmos, in particular, owned by Warner Communications, were spending lavish sums on player salaries, and while other teams—such as Los Angeles, Jacksonville, Portland, Toronto, and Montreal—that were owned by major corporations could keep up with the Cosmos, owners without deep pockets could not keep pace with the spending levels. Owners spent millions on aging stars to try to match the success of the Cosmos and lost significant amounts of money in doing so.

Another headache for NASL was competition from the resurgent Major Indoor Soccer League. The MISL began during the 1978–79 season, grew quickly, and by the early 1980s MISL was averaging over 8,000 fans per game. MISL&#x27;s growth meant that throughout the early 1980s the NASL and the MISL engaged in a bidding war for U.S.-based soccer players, putting further pressure on league salaries and heightening NASL&#x27;s financial problems. In an effort to vie for MISL&#x27;s expanding audiences, the NASL operated an indoor soccer league from 1979–80 to 1981–82 and in 1983–84.

As a result, the league ran a collective deficit in 1980 of about $30 million (or $ in ), with each team losing money. The San Diego Sockers lost $10 million from 1978 to 1983, and Tulsa lost $8 million from 1980 to 1983. The Washington Diplomats folded in November 1980, after owners MSG Corp. lost a rumored $5 million on the team in 1979 and 1980.

NASL had also decided to sell TV advertising locally, instead of recruiting national sponsors. During the 1980 offseason, the NASL Players&#x27; Association was in dispute with the league over projected payments for the indoor season, causing the players to file a lawsuit against the league.

The 1981 season was even worse for the league, with the league&#x27;s 24 teams again running a collective deficit of $30 million (or $ in ) and every team losing money. Ted Turner&#x27;s Atlanta Chiefs lost $7 million (or $ in ), the Minnesota Kicks lost $2.5 million (or $ in ), the Calgary Boomers lost over $2 million (or $ in ), and Lamar Hunt&#x27;s Dallas Tornado had lost $1 million annually. 
At the close of the 1981 season five teams folded, with another two teams—the L.A. Aztecs and Minnesota Kicks—later folding during the 1981–82 offseason after failing to find buyers. NASL shrank from 21 teams to 14.

Many of these new owners were not soccer savvy, and once the perceived popularity started to decline, they got out as quickly as they got in.
Over-expansion without sufficient vetting of ownership groups was a huge factor in the death of the league. Once the league started growing, new franchises were awarded quickly, and it doubled in size in a few years, peaking at 24 teams. Many have suggested that cash-starved existing owners longed for their share of the expansion fee charged of new owners, even though &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot; reported this amount as being only $100,000.

===Decline and demise===

With the league declining rapidly in the early 1980s and losing many franchises, the NASL made several changes in an attempt to keep going. Phil Woosnam, who had served as NASL Commissioner since 1969 and had been a strong proponent of expansion during the 1970s, was removed by the league&#x27;s 14 owners in April 1982 by a reported 11–3 vote. NASL tried to help bring the 1986 World Cup to the United States after Colombia withdrew from its commitment to host, but FIFA decided in 1983 to award the hosting of the 1986 FIFA World Cup to Mexico, rather than the U.S. In early 1984, NASL reached a collective bargaining agreement with the NASL Players Association that included a $825,000 salary cap to be achieved by annual 10% reductions, and a reduction in roster sizes from 28 to 19.

The league lasted until the 1984 NASL season with only nine teams taking the field. On March 28, 1985, the NASL suspended operations for the 1985 season, when only the Minnesota Strikers and Toronto Blizzard were interested in playing. At the time, the league planned to relaunch in 1986.

Of those final nine teams, the Chicago Sting, Minnesota Strikers, New York Cosmos, and San Diego Sockers joined the Major Indoor Soccer League for its 1984–85 season. The Tulsa Roughnecks independently played 11 matches in 1985, before suspending operations on July 17. The Golden Bay Earthquakes and Tampa Bay Rowdies managed to survive as independent franchises until they joined the WSA and AISA respectively. The Rowdies were the last surviving NASL franchise to play outdoor soccer, lasting until February 1994. The Sockers were the final league franchise to dissolve. They survived playing exclusively indoor soccer until 1996.

===Heritage===
After the United States&#x27; early elimination in 1982 World Cup qualifying, American manager Walt Chyzowych stated the NASL had failed to offer much of a foundation for his team, since the league had largely failed to develop American players. Canada fared better, coming a win short of qualification for the 1982 World Cup with a squad exclusively made up of NASL players. 
Although the NASL ultimately failed, it did introduce soccer to the North American sports scene on a large scale for the first time, and was a major contributing factor in soccer becoming one of the most popular sports among American youth. On July 4, 1988, FIFA awarded the hosting of the 1994 World Cup to the United States. NASL has also provided lessons for its successor Major League Soccer, which has taken precautions against such problems, particularly a philosophy of financial restraint (mainstream American sports, by the time of MLS&#x27; startup in 1996, had adopted financial restraint rules, which MLS adopted). American college and high school soccer still use some NASL-style rules (with shortened halves, although the time does stop for certain reasons).

18 of the 22 players on the Canadian squad at the 1986 World Cup were former NASL players. The United States did not have any former NASL players on their squad at the 1990 World Cup but had three on the 1994 team (Fernando Clavijo, Hugo Pérez and Roy Wegerle) and one on the 1998 team (Wegerle).

Several NASL team names have been reused by teams in later soccer leagues. Currently the Portland Timbers, San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders FC, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC are all successor teams in Major League Soccer. Four other well known names (New York Cosmos, Tampa Bay Rowdies, Fort Lauderdale Strikers, and Tulsa Roughnecks) have resurfaced in the new NASL and the USL, which are both Division II leagues. Two of the oldest derbies in North American professional soccer &quot;(Cascadia Cup and Fort Lauderdale–Tampa Bay)&quot; began in the NASL of the 1970s, and continue today via successor clubs.

===NASL indoor===

The NASL first staged an indoor tournament in 1971 at the St. Louis Arena with a $2,800 purse. After a couple of years of experimenting, including a three-city tour by the Red Army team from Moscow in 1974, the league again staged tournaments in 1975 and 1976. For many years Tampa Bay owner George W. Strawbridge, Jr. lobbied his fellow owners to start up a winter indoor season, but was repeatedly stone-walled by other owners. For several years, his Rowdies and several other teams used winter indoor &quot;friendlies&quot; as part of their training and build-up to the outdoor season. In the meantime, pressed by the rival Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL), which inaugurated play in 1978, two-day mini-tournaments like the Skelly Invitational and the NASL Budweiser Invitational were held with varying degrees of success. The NASL finally started a full indoor league schedule, a 12-game season with 10 teams, in 1979–80. For the 1980–81 season, the number of teams playing indoor soccer increased to 19 and the schedule grew to 18 games. The schedule remained at 18 games, but the teams participating decreased to 13 for the 1981–82 season. The league canceled the 1982–83 indoor season and three teams (Chicago, Golden Bay, and San Diego) played in the MISL for that season. Four other teams (Fort Lauderdale, Montreal, Tampa Bay and Tulsa) competed in a short NASL Grand Prix of Indoor Soccer Tournament in early 1983. The NASL indoor season returned for 1983–84 with only seven teams but a 32-game schedule.

==Commissioners==
*1967: Dick Walsh (USA) – After 18 years with the Los Angeles Dodgers, he was chosen to serve as commissioner of first the United Soccer Association (USA) in 1966, then the North American Soccer League (NASL), which resulted from the merger of the US and the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) prior to the 1968 season. He served the NASL through its first full season, 1968, then returned to baseball. 
*1967: Ken Macker (NPSL)
*1968: Walsh and Macker co-commissioners
*1969–83: Phil Woosnam – He is credited as an important factor in the development of the NASL, and had been a major figure in promoting the league and had secured TV contracts from CBS and ABC. He played a key role during 1970 in recruiting executives at Warner Communications to invest in an expansion team—the New York Cosmos. Woosnam oversaw the westward expansion of NASL in the early 1970s, establishing teams in Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Seattle, and Vancouver. However, he also guided the league into several poor business decisions, such as over-expansion to 24 teams, that led to team owners&#x27; significant financial losses. He was removed from his duties as commissioner of the NASL in 1983 following a vote of the club owners.
*1983–84: Howard J. Samuels – His pioneering methods in the petrochemical industry and success in the then-niche household consumer market translated into posts as Vice President of the Mobil Oil Corporation, Commissioner of the North American Soccer League, and chairman to Elms Capital Management, Alexander Proudfoot PLC, and Communities in Schools. 
*1984–85: Clive Toye (acting) – After the sudden death of Howard J. Samuels, Toye was appointed interim president of the NASL in December 1984. The league ceased operations early the following year.

==Players==
The NASL brought some of the world&#x27;s best soccer players to the United States. The trend started early as players such as Vavá, Peter McParland, Rubén Marino Navarro, Co Prins and Juan Santisteban appeared in the league in 1968. However, after the Cosmos signed Pele in 1975, the number of famous names increased during the NASL&#x27;s peak during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In fact, 20 of the 44 World Cup Best XI selections between 1966 and 1978 spent time in the NASL. At one time NASL squads fielded the captains of the past three World Cup-winning teams—Beckenbauer (1974), Alberto (1970), and Moore (1966). Of the European Footballer of the Year awards from 1965 to 1976, eight of the twelve awards—Eusébio (1965), Best (1968), Muller (1970), Cruyff (1971, &#x27;73, &#x27;74), Beckenbauer (1972, &#x27;76) —were given to players who went on to play in NASL. In addition, several players went on to greater acclaim after leaving the NASL, among them Peter Beardsley, Bruce Grobbelaar, Julio César Romero, Hugo Sánchez and Graeme Souness. Two players appeared in both the NASL and MLS, spanning a 12-year gap in North American professional soccer: Hugo Sánchez and Roy Wegerle.

<doc id="237759" wikidata="Q561531" url="?curid=237759" title="Baillie Scott">
<text>Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott (23 October 1865 – 10 February 1945) was a British architect and artist. Through his long career, he designed in a variety of styles, including a style derived from the Tudor, an Arts and Crafts style reminiscent of Voysey and later the Neo-Georgian.

==Early life==
The son of a wealthy Scottish landowner, Scott was born at Beards Hill, St Peter&#x27;s near Broadstairs, Kent, the second of ten children. He originally studied at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, but, having qualified in 1885, he decided to study architecture instead. He studied briefly in Bath, but his architectural development was especially marked by the 12 years he spent living in the Isle of Man. The first four years of this time he lived at Alexander Terrace, Douglas. In 1893, he and his family moved to Red House, Victoria Road, Douglas, which he had designed.

==Career==
At the beginning of his career, Scott worked with Fred Saunders, with whom he had studied at the Isle of Man School of Art, which is also in Douglas. In May 1891, he was an art teacher. It was at the school of art that Scott and Archibald Knox became friends. He then left Saunders and set up his own business in 23 Athol Street, Douglas. In 1894, in an article in &quot;The Studio&quot;, he proposed a design having a high central hall with a galleried inglenook between the drawing and dining rooms and separated from them by folding screens. This hypothetical &#x27;ideal house&#x27; brought in many commissions.

Scott developed his own Arts and Crafts style however, which progressed towards a simple form of architecture, relying on truth to material and function, and on precise craftsmanship.

Scott was known for the work he put into both the exterior and the interior, and its decoration. He produced nearly 300 buildings over the course of his career.

==Notable buildings==

* Bexton Croft, Knutsford, Cheshire, 1896, Grade II* listed
* Blackwell, Bowness, Cumbria, 1898–1900, Grade I listed
* The White House, Helensburgh, Scotland, 1899, Category A
* Home Close, Sibford Ferris, Oxfordshire, 1911
* Snowshill Manor gardens, 1920–23
* Church Rate Corner (private house), Cambridge, 1924, Grade II listed
* Oakhams, 1942 (additions; his home)
* Red House, Isle of Man
* Woodbury Hollow, Loughton, Essex
* Winscombe House, Crowborough, Sussex
* Sandford House, Kilmany, Fife, Scotland, Category B
* Majestic Hotel, Onchan, Isle of Man (demolished)
* White Lodge, Wantage, Oxfordshire
*Chludzinski&#x27;s Mansion, Lieskavičy, Šumilina district, Vitebsk region, Belarus (derelicted)

==Family &amp; Later life==
He married Florence Kate Nash, a descendant of Beau Nash, on 1 February 1899 in Batheaston Parish Church, Somerset.
They had two children:
* Daughter, Enid Maud Mackay Baillie-Scott, born 26 November 1889 d. 1968
* Son, Mackay Hugh Baillie-Scott, born 13 May 1891 d. 1943
He died at the Elm Grove Hospital (now Brighton General Hospital) in the Elm Grove area of Brighton. His gravestone in Edenbridge, Kent reads: &quot;Nature he loved and next to nature art&quot;.

<doc id="237762" wikidata="Q14875515" url="?curid=237762" title="Charlevoix">
<text>Charlevoix ( , ) is a cultural and natural region in Quebec, on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River as well as in the Laurentian Mountains area of the Canadian Shield. This dramatic landscape includes rolling terrain, fjords, headlands, and bays; the region was designated a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1989. Administratively, it comprises the Charlevoix and Charlevoix-Est regional county municipalities within the larger Capitale-Nationale administrative region.

==History==
The region was named after Pierre François-Xavier de Charlevoix, a French Jesuit explorer and historian who travelled through the area in the 18th century. The community of La Malbaie was known as the first resort area in Canada. As early as 1760, Scottish noblemen Malcolm Fraser and John Nairne hosted visitors at their manors. For much of its history, Charlevoix was home to a thriving summer colony of wealthy Americans, including President William Howard Taft.

==Geography==

From an administrative point of view, the &quot;Charlevoix region&quot; does not exist in itself, but is rather made up of the regional county municipalities of Charlevoix-Est and Charlevoix.

Features of note include:
* Baie-Saint-Paul, an important arts centre
* Le Domaine Forget music festival and academy
* Île aux Coudres
* the Parc des Grands-Jardins
* the Haute-Gorges de la Rivière Malbaie
* the Manoir Richelieu and the Casino de Charlevoix
* the fjord of the Saguenay River
* the Commission scolaire de Charlevoix
* the Museum of Charlevoix

==Natural history==
The topography of this region was dramatically altered by a meteorite impact that occurred 350 million years ago creating the Charlevoix impact structure: The impact created the forty-mile-wide crater that is the heart of Quebec&#x27;s Charlevoix region, ranging from just west of Baie-Saint-Paul to just east of La Malbaie. Today, the area inside the crater is home to 90 percent of Charlevoix residents and is a very pastoral setting by comparison to what it could have been.
This area was subsequently reshaped by glaciation during the last ice age.

There have been several major earthquakes in the region in recorded history:

*on February 5, 1663, centred south of La Malbaie. See 1663 Charlevoix earthquake.
*on December 6, 1791, centred near Baie-Saint-Paul
*on October 17, 1860, centred under the Saint Lawrence River
*on October 20, 1870, centred near Baie-Saint-Paul. See 1870 Charlevoix earthquake
*on February 28, 1925, centred under the Saint Lawrence River. See 1925 Charlevoix–Kamouraska earthquake.

==Ecological characteristics==

Situated some 80 km east of Quebec City, Charlevoix Biosphere Reserve borders the Saint Lawrence River to the south. Extending from 5 to 1,150 metres above sea level, the area comprises agricultural areas, river ecosystems, estuarine tidal marshes and flats, coniferous and mixed forests, stunted vegetation (krummholz) and mountain tundra ecosystems.

Maple forests including paper birch (&quot;Betula papyriferae&quot;), alder (&quot;Alnus spp.&quot;) and elm (&quot;Ulmus spp.&quot;) and with an understory of sumac (&quot;Rhus typhina&quot;), &quot;Acer pensylvanicum&quot; and &quot;Cornus alternifolia&quot;; mixed fir (&quot;Abies sp.&quot;) forest with &quot;Corylus cornuta&quot;, &quot;Sambucus pubens&quot; and &quot;Taxus canadensis&quot;; boreal forests up to an altitude of 300 metres with fir and spruce (&quot;Picea spp.&quot;); estuarine tidal marsh and flats dominated by &quot;Scirpus americanus&quot; meadows including &quot;Zizania palustris&quot;, &quot;Sagittaria cuneata&quot; and &quot;S. latifolia&quot;; tundra with ericaceous zones consisting of &quot;Kalmia spp.&quot;, &quot;Ledum groenlandicum&quot;; stunted vegetation community (krummholz) with &quot;Picea mariana&quot; and &quot;Abies balsamea&quot;; agro-ecosystems with cereals, fruits and legumes, and river ecosystems.

Animal species in the area include beluga whale (&quot;Delphinapterus leucas&quot;), wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), boreal woodland caribou (&quot;Rangifer tarandus caribou&quot;), North American cougar (&quot;Puma concolor couguar&quot;) and blue whale (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus&quot;).

==Socio-economic characteristics==
About 30,000 people live in the biosphere reserve (1988), which covers 457,000 hectares. In former times, the population of Charlevoix used to rely on the river and the sea, for example on coastal navigation, marine constructions and fisheries (e.g. beluga, eel).

Today, the economic landscape has diversified and major factors in the local economy are now forestry, silica mining, agriculture and tourism. The forest education centre ‘Les Palissades’ or the ecological centre ‘Port-au-Saumon’ are important institutions for environmental education in the area.

===Transportation===

Quebec Route 138 is the major highway through the region, which closely follows the shoreline of the Saint Lawrence River. Between Baie-Saint-Paul and La Malbaie, the highway turns inland with Quebec Route 362 serving the riverside communities of Les Éboulements and Saint-Irénée.

The Train de Charlevoix, a tourist rail service, links the coastal communities of Charlevoix to Quebec City.

Charlevoix Airport is a small regional airport serving the region.
