<text>The brachiocephalic artery, brachiocephalic trunk, or innominate artery is an artery of the mediastinum that supplies blood to the right arm, head, and neck.

It is the first branch of the aortic arch. Soon after it emerges, the brachiocephalic artery divides into the right common carotid artery and the right subclavian artery.

There is no brachiocephalic artery for the left side of the body. The left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery come directly off the aortic arch. Despite this, there are two brachiocephalic veins.

== Structure ==
The brachiocephalic artery arises on a level with the upper border of the second right costal cartilage from the start of the aortic arch on a plane anterior to the origin of the left carotid artery. It ascends obliquely upward, backward, and to the right to the level of the upper border of the right sternoclavicular articulation, where it divides into the right common carotid artery and right subclavian arteries. The artery then crosses the trachea in front of it obliquely from the left to the right, roughly at the middle of the trachea or the level of the ninth tracheal cartilage.

=== Relations ===
The brachiocephalic artery has relation with:
* &quot;anterior&quot; - left brachiocephalic vein and thymus
* &quot;posterior&quot; - trachea
* &quot;right&quot; - superior vena cava, right brachiocephalic vein, and pleura
* &quot;left&quot; - left common carotid artery and thymus

The thymus typically sits atop the brachiocephalic artery, and it separates the artery from the posterior surface of the manubrium of sternum.

===Branches===
The thyroid ima artery ascends in front of the trachea to the lower part of the thyroid, which it supplies.

===Variation===
The innominate artery usually gives off no branches, but occasionally a small branch, the thyroid ima artery, arises from it. Other times, it gives off a thymic or bronchial branch.

Thyroid ima artery varies greatly in size, and appears to compensate for deficiency or absence of one of the other thyroid vessels. It occasionally arises from the aorta, the right common carotid, the subclavian or the internal mammary.

== Development ==
The aortic sac is the embryological precursor of the proximal portion of the aortic arch. It is chronologically the first portion of the aorta to form, and appears as a dilation superior to the truncus arteriosus. Between the two horns of aortic sac, right horn gives rise to the brachiocephalic artery. Then the right horn fuses with the right-sided third and fourth aortic arches, which give rise to the right common carotid artery and the proximal right subclavian artery respectively. Eventually, brachiocephalic artery is derived from ventral aorta, same as ascending aorta. Left horn forms proximal ascending portion of aorta.

== Function ==
The brachiocephalic artery sends blood from the heart to the right arm, head, and neck. Oxygenated blood from the aortic trunk is taken through the brachiocephalic artery into the right subclavian artery, which transports blood to the right arm, and into the right common carotid artery, where blood is transported to the head and neck.

== Clinical significance ==
Innominate artery aneurysms represent 3% of all arterial aneurysms. Because there is a risk of thromboembolic complications and spontaneous rupture, surgical repair is usually recommended early on after discovery. Innominate artery aneurysms often present with signs of innominate artery compression syndrome and have a very high risk of rupture. The majority of IA aneurysms are due to atherosclerosis. Other causes include syphilis, tuberculosis, Kawasaki&#x27;s disease, Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis, Behçet&#x27;s disease, connective tissue disease, and angiosarcoma.

Tracheoinnominate fistula (TIF) is a surgical emergency with high mortality rates. Reported incidence is 0.1%-1.0% after tracheostomy. TIF is usually fatal once it bleeds. For the successful management of TIF, treatment should be initiated immediately with special considerations kept in mind.

Several abnormalities of the brachiocephalic artery have been reported. A retroesophageal innominate artery is a rare congenital anomaly. Also, aberrant innominate artery crossing anterior to the trachea just below the thyroid isthmus was reported. Anterior neck surgeries such as bronchoscopies and mediastinoscopies are common and safe procedure, since operating around the trachea, no major vessel is encountered in the surgical field. However, when this type of abnormality is encountered, even minor trauma can lead to mass bleeding culminating in death. Aberrant innominate artery can cause incomplete vascular ring. It does not completely encircle the trachea and esophagus, but some compress either the trachea or esophagus. Anomalous innominate artery originates later from the transverse arch and then crosses the trachea causing anterior tracheal compression.

<doc id="238258" wikidata="Q571928" url="?curid=238258" title="Overhang seat">
<text>Overhang seats are constituency seats won in an election under the traditional mixed-member proportional (MMP) system (as it originated in Germany), when a party&#x27;s share of the nationwide votes would entitle it to fewer seats than the number of individual constituencies won.

== How overhang seats arise ==
Under MMP, a party is entitled to a number of seats based on its share of the total vote. If a party&#x27;s share entitles it to ten seats and its candidates win seven constituencies, it will be awarded three list seats, bringing it up to its required number. This only works, however, if the party&#x27;s seat entitlement is greater than the number of constituencies it has won. If, for example, a party is entitled to five seats, but wins six constituencies, the sixth constituency seat is referred to as an overhang seat. Overhang typically results from the winner-take-all tendency of single-member districts, or if the geographic distribution of parties allows one to win many seats with few votes.

== Earning overhang seats ==
The two mechanisms that together increase the number of overhang seats are:
# winning many constituencies;
# decreasing the number of party votes and therefore the number of seats to which the party is proportionally entitled.

In many countries, overhang seats are rare – a party that is able to win constituency seats is generally able to win a significant portion of the party vote as well. There are, however, some circumstances in which overhang seats may arise relatively easily:

*Few major parties, large number of minor parties – When there are only one or two major parties, but a relatively large number of minor parties that, combined, achieve a significant share of the total proportional vote, but fail to win any constituency seats, the large parties often end up with overhang seats.
* Similar lead across constituencies – If one party wins all or most constituencies of a relevant area with a rather low margin, it would be more prone to overhang mandates than if different parties lead in different constituencies, with the same overall share of each of the parties. As such, if there is less difference between constituencies, overhang seats are more probable.
*A large number of constituencies compared with the total number of seats – If too many seats are used for constituencies, the remainder are less likely to ensure strict proportionality.
*Unevenly sized constituencies – Candidates that win small constituencies by a narrow margin do not generate enough votes to justify their full seats under a proportional system.
*Low turnout in some constituencies – This has the same effect as small constituencies. Furthermore, turnout and party preferences may be highly correlated, e.g. rural vs. urban areas.
*Small number of seats to be allocated – The higher the absolute number of constituencies, the more likely it is that different reasons for overhang seats will balance out between parties. E.g., after the German federal Bundestag election in 2013, the main reason for overhang seats was that some compensation happens for party&#x27;s state lists instead of at the federal level only.
*Individual candidates with strong local followings – Sometimes, a particular politician will have strong support in their own constituency, but will belong to a party with very low support, even in their own area. The candidate will be elected based on their own qualities, but the party they belong to will not receive enough votes to justify the candidate&#x27;s seat. In the case of independent candidates, this is usually guaranteed – they have no party at all, and so obviously cannot win votes under MMP&#x27;s party-list proportional representation. However, some countries, such as New Zealand, have special rules dealing with independents – seats won by these candidates are exempted from the proportional system altogether.
*Regional parties – Parties based in a particular region may win a substantial number of constituency seats in that region without necessarily gaining a large share of the national vote. Parties focused on particular ethnic or religious minorities may also come under this category, particularly if seats are reserved for these groups.
*Tactical voting – Voters in countries that can cast a vote in the list vote and cast a local vote (such as Germany) may decide not to vote for a local candidate that has little chance of winning but still support that party on the list vote. Parties that win many local seats but attract a reduced list vote may receive an overhang as a result.
*Decoy parties – Party labels in the constituencies can be deliberately mismatched with those in the proportional vote in an attempt to induce tactical voting. In Italy in 2001, two lists won a significant majority of the total number of first-past-the post seats, despite winning almost none of the proportional vote. The system, nicknamed scorporo, was not a type of additional member system in which overhangs could occur, it resulted in a significant distortion to the desired compensatory nature.

==Dealing with overhang seats==
Overhang seats are dealt with in different ways by different systems.

===Take the number of additional list seats off from the other parties&#x27; proportional entitlement===
A party is allowed to keep any overhang seats it wins, and the corresponding number of list seats allocated to other parties is eliminated to maintain the number of assembly seats. This means that a party with overhang seats has more seats than its entitlement, and other parties have fewer. This approach is used in the Chamber of Deputies of Bolivia and the National Assembly of Lesotho. It was unsuccessfully recommended by the 2006 Ontario Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform for adoption by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and the proposed Dual-member proportional representation system uses this approach as well. While for the first additional list seats are simply denied to parties, in the latter three cases, a fairer procedure was proposed of subtracting the constituency seats won by parties with overhang seats from the total number of seats and recalculating the quota (the largest remainder method was also recommended) to proportionally redistribute the list seats to the other parties.

In the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd and London Assembly, the effect is similar, but the mechanism different. In the allocation of second vote list seats using a highest averages method, the first vote constituency seats already won are taken into account when calculating party averages, with the aim of making the overall result proportional. If a party wins more seats in the first vote than its proportion of second votes would suggest it should win overall, or if an independent candidate wins a constituency seat, then the automatic effect is to reduce the overall number of seats won by other parties below what they might expect proportionally.

===Allow the overhang===
A party is allowed to keep any overhang seats it wins, but other parties are still awarded the same number of seats that they are entitled to. This means that a party with overhang seats has more seats than its entitlement. The New Zealand Parliament uses this system; one extra seat was added in the 2005 election and 2011 election, and two extra seats in the 2008 election. This system was also used in the German Bundestag until 2013.

=== Compensating the overhang ===
Other parties may be given additional list seats (sometimes called &quot;balance seats&quot; or leveling seats) lest they be disadvantaged. This preserves the same ratio between parties as was established in the election. It also increases the size of the legislature, as overhang seats are added, and there may also be extra list seats added to counteract them. The result of this system is less proportional than full compensation, as the party with the overhang is still receiving a &quot;bonus&quot; above its proportional entitlement. After the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled in 2008 that allowing uncompensated overhang seats was unconstitutional (because in rare instances, it allowed votes to negatively affect the number of seats for a given party, contradicting the voter&#x27;s will), leveling seats were introduced for the 2013 election and also used in those of 2017 and 2021.

===Non-awarding of overhang seats===
A party is not allowed to keep any overhang seats it wins, with its number of seats actually being reduced until it fits the party&#x27;s entitlement. This method raises the question of which constituency seats the party is not allowed to keep. After that is determined, it would then have to be decided who, if any, will represent these constituencies. This was used in the Landtag of Bavaria until 1966, with the candidates with the lowest number of votes not keeping the constituency seat.

This system is now in place at the federal level in Germany, starting with the forthcoming 2025 election. As with the previous system in Bavaria, overhanging constituency winners are excluded in order of lowest vote share.

== Constitutionality ==
Prior to German reunification, overhang mandates - particularly at the federal level - were relatively rare and never amounted to more than five (out of over 400 total seats) in any given Bundestag and several federal elections resulted in no overhang at all. This was in part due to the relative strength of the two major parties, CDU/CSU and SPD; with both parties winning large shares of the vote in the pre-reunification three-party system, it was rare for either to win more than a handful of overhanging constituencies.

However, this began to change as East Germany started participating in German federal elections starting with the 1990 German federal election, with the PDS posting particularly strong results in those states. This, along with the rise of Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens, served to depress the party-list vote shares, creating more overhang seats than in prior elections.

In the 1994 German federal election, the re-elected Kohl government supported by a &quot;black-yellow&quot; coalition (CDU/CSU and FDP) achieved a relatively slim majority of 341 out of 672 seats to the opposition&#x27;s (SPD, Alliance 90/The Greens, PDS) 331 seats at the opening session. This majority would have been even narrower if not for twelve overhang seats the CDU/CSU had achieved, which were however partially mitigated by the four overhang seats for the SPD. This led to much more public debate on the existence of overhang seats and what to do about them. There was even a challenge of the validity of the election result based on the overhang seat issue raised by a private citizen after the 1994 election, which was however dismissed as &quot;obviously without merit&quot;.

The problem thus turning from a theoretical consideration to a real issue, the German Constitutional Court as early as 1997 ruled that a &quot;substantial number&quot; of overhang mandates which weren&#x27;t equalized through leveling seats were unconstitutional. The issue became more pressing after a particularly notorious case of negative vote weight at the 2005 election. The election in the Dresden I constituency was held two weeks later than the other 298 constituencies after the death of a candidate. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published an article in the intervening time outlining how more votes for the CDU could lead to them losing an overhang seat, and thus narrowing their plurality in the close election. The anticipated tactical voting in Dresden I did occur as Andreas Lämmel (CDU) won the constituency with roughly 37% of the constituency vote while his party won only 24.4% of the party-list vote, with the FDP receiving 16.6% - more than one and a half times their federal vote share of 9.8%.

This led to another ruling by the German Constitutional Court in 2008 which ruled that the existing federal electoral law was unconstitutional in part as it violated the principle of one person one vote and produced an overly opaque relationship between the numbers of votes cast and seats in parliament. However, the Court also allowed for a three year deadline to change the electoral law, allowing for the 2009 German federal election to be held under the previous set of rules.

The electoral reform passed with the votes of the governing &quot;black-yellow&quot; coalition in late 2011 (a few weeks after the deadline set in 2008) - and without consulting the opposition parties - was again ruled unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court. Furthermore, the Court clarified that the federal electoral system was supposed to be primarily one of proportional representation and a number of non-compensated overhang seats above 15 would &quot;dilute&quot; this proportional character.

As the Bundestag thus lacked a constitutional electoral mechanism and the 2013 German federal election was coming up, the government agreed to negotiations with the opposition parties, leading to a new electoral law being passed in early 2013 with broad support from all parties in the Bundestag except Die Linke. This added leveling seats and was used in the 2013, 2017 and 2021 elections.

On the state level, an unclear wording in the state electoral law of Schleswig-Holstein led to different possible assignments of leveling seats to equalize the overhang seats ultimately resulting in the 2009 Schleswig-Holstein state election giving a majority of seats to the Peter Harry Carstensen led &quot;black-yellow&quot; coalition, despite them having won a lower share of the vote than the SPD, Greens, Left, SSW opposition. Following a suit before the State Constitutional Court brought by opposition parties, it was ruled that the electoral law in its then current interpretation did indeed violate the state constitution but that the Landtag was to keep its composition until a new electoral law could be passed (which happened in 2011) after which new elections would be scheduled with enough time for campaigns setting the next election for 2012, two years earlier than if the Landtag had served its full five year term.

The 2023 reform which eliminated the awarding of all overhang and leveling seats was also subject to a constitutional challenge. The Federal Constitutional Court upheld this part of the law.

== Examples ==

=== Germany ===
In the system used in Germany until the 2025 election, every constituency seat won by any party or an independent is granted, while the electoral system requires that a party needs 5% of the party-list vote to win list seats. If a party wins at least three constituency seats, it is granted full proportional representation as if it passed the 5% electoral threshold, even if it did not. The awarding of overhang seats and the leveling seats required to compensate for this led to a drastic increase in the size of the Bundestag beyond its normal size of 598 members.

In the 2021 federal election, The Left fell just short of the election threshold with 4.9% of the national vote but won three single-member constituency seats. This entitled them to proportional representation in the Bundestag according to their second votes. The extra compensation seats for other parties meant that the Bundestag would be the largest in German history, and in fact the largest freely elected parliament in the world, with 736 MPs.

In 2023, in response to the increasing size of the Bundestag, the Scholz cabinet passed a reform law to fix the size of future Bundestags at 630 members beginning with the 2025 election. This is achieved by eliminating all overhang and leveling seats. A party&#x27;s total number of seats will be determined solely by its share of party-list votes (&quot;Zweitstimmendeckung&quot;, &quot;second vote coverage&quot;). If a party wins overhanging constituency seats in a state, its constituency winners in excess of its share of seats would be excluded from the Bundestag in order of those that received the smallest vote shares. The rule allowing any party winning three constituency seats to receive full proportional representation was originally also abolished. The Federal Constitutional Court, however, decided that a 5% electoral threshold with no exceptions was unconstitutional and the rule was restored on an interim basis for the 2025 election.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, Te Pāti Māori (the Māori Party) usually gets less than 5% of the party votes, the threshold required to enter parliament – unless the party wins an electorate seat. Te Pāti Māori won one overhang seat in 2005 and 2011, and two overhang seats in 2008. In 2005 their share of the party vote was under 2% on the initial election night count, but was 2.12% in the final count which included special votes cast outside the electorate. On election night it appeared that the party, whose candidates had won four electorate seats, would get two overhang seats in Parliament. However, with their party vote above 2% the party got an extra seat and hence needed only one overhang seat. National got one less list seat in the final count, so then conceded defeat (the result was close between the two largest parties, National and Labour). Te Pāti Māori won six electorate seats in 2023, two more than its 3.08% share of the party vote entitled it to; and shortly after the general election, the Port Waikato by-election resulted in a further overhang seat for National.

<text>Gundelfingen im Breisgau (Low Alemannic: &quot;Gundelfinge im Brisgau&quot;) is a municipality directly north of the city Freiburg in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany.

Gundelfingen is one of the larger municipalities in the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district. It consists of the old place Gundelfingen and the village Wildtal, which was included in the municipality in the 1970s.

==History==

=== Gundelfingen ===
Gundelfingen was founded in the 4th century, so at least the suffix &quot;-ingen&quot; suggests. The name means that some Alamannic chief by the name of &quot;Gundolf&quot; settled there with his folk. The first sure sign of Gundelfingen&#x27;s existence is found in a 1008 treaty, where a place called &quot;Gondalvingen&quot; is named.

In 1327, Gundelfingen was sold by Counts Konrad and Friedrich of Freiburg to Schnewelin Bernlapp. In 1507, his successor Balthasar von Blumeneck sold Gundelfingen again, this time to Margrave Christopher I of Baden. Since then it was part of Baden.

In the 16th century, some 350 inhabitants lived in Gundelfingen. In 1825 it was 620, in 1950 1,817. Only in the 1960s and 1970s the numbers started to expand quickly to 5,016 inhabitants in 1970 and 11,000 inhabitants in 2002.

=== Wildtal ===
Wildtal was first named in a document in 1273 as &quot;Wülptal&quot; (whelp dale) or &quot;Wolfstal&quot; (wolf&#x27;s dale).
The present name just translates as &quot;wild dale&quot;.

==Administration==
In 1972, Wildtal was included into the municipality of Gundelfingen, after three quarters of its citizens voted for this inclusion.

The Mayor of Gundelfingen is at the same time the Mayor of the neighboring village Heuweiler which is associated for administrative purposes.

== Environs ==

On the territory that belongs to the municipality of Gundelfingen you can, inter alia, find the following:

===Protestant Church===

==== Stork&#x27;s nest ====
Since 1993 storks are nesting again in Gundelfingen. Their nest is on the steeple of the Protestant church at the corner of the streets &quot;Kirchstraße&quot; and &quot;Kirchenwinkel&quot;.

==== Luthereiche (Luther&#x27;s oak) ====
The &quot;Luthereiche&quot; (Luther&#x27;s oak) which was planted next to the protestant church in 1883 on the occasion of 400th birthday of the reformer Martin Luther was the first natural monument of Gundelfingen. A plaque commemorating it is on the outside wall of the church. The tree of a height of 50 ft was felled in 2011 because of dry rot. It is highly likely that a new oak will be planted in its place, perhaps in 2017 when the 500th anniversary of the protestant reformation will be celebrated. Such an oak has the function of a monument commemorating the reformation. The very first oak with that purpose was planted in Wittenberg on the same spot where Luther had publicly burned the papal bull.

===East of the Railway===

====Pond====
This pond is located in a small park in the middle of the residential area &quot;Am See&quot; (at the lake) to the east of the train station. Mallards as well as goldfish are living there.

====Birding trail====
Further to the East, in the forest just above the streets &quot;Sonnhalde&quot; and &quot;Jägerpfad&quot;, there is a very interesting birding trail with more than 40 nest boxes where numerous species of birds are breeding. Furthermore, a large number of birds which do not have their nests in cavities can be observed there as well.

====Rebberg====
The hill to the south of this area and the north of the street &quot;Am Rebberg&quot;, itself to the north of the road connecting Gundelfingen and Wildtal, is called &quot;Rebberg&quot; which is the German word for vineyard, because on its slope grapes are cultivated for winemaking. The varietals cultivated here are primarily for red and white Burgundy.

====Leheneck====
Further to the northeast there is a low saddle called &quot;Leheneck&quot;, 1060 ft above sea level, which has views towards the north (Heuweiler) and the south (Wildtal).

=== Wildtal ===
Wildtal is the name of both the village pertaining to Gundelfingen and the valley. The most important stream of this valley and of Gundelfingen is the &quot;Schobbach&quot;.

====Dorfbrunnen====
In Wildtal, at the corner of the streets &quot;Heuweilerweg&quot; and &quot;Talstraße&quot;, you see the &quot;Dorfbrunnen&quot; (village well).

====Talstraße====
The &quot;Talstraße&quot; (dale street) leads you right through the whole &quot;Wildtal&quot; valley.

====Wildtalereck====
At the end of the valley you come to the &quot;Wildtalereck&quot;, 1496 ft above sea level, from where there are views towards the west.

====Waldbrunnerhof====
From the &quot;Talstraße&quot; the &quot;Waldbrunnerweg&quot; branches off towards the south. From around the farm called &quot;Waldbrunnerhof&quot;, 482 ft above sea level, one has a good view. The &quot;Waldbrunnerweg&quot; leads you to the castle.

====Zähringen castle====
The shortest way is from the cemetery of Wildtal through the mountain forest to the spot where &quot;Zähringen castle&quot; stood. Its tower is still standing. There is a restaurant nearby where you can also drive by car from Freiburg&#x27;s suburb Zähringen.

=== Reutebacher Höfe ===
Reute means clearing, Bach stream, and Höfe yards. The Reutebach is a stream having its source on the Roßkopf and the Reutebacher Höfe are remote farmhouses on this mountain which are connected by a road, the &quot;Pochgasse&quot;, to Freiburg&#x27;s suburb Zähringen. The area where they are located has the same name as the stream and is also called Reutebach. It was an enclave of Gundelfingen until the expansion of its boundaries by the incorporation of Wildtal.

Once Reutebach was an independent village and even larger than either Gundelfingen, Wildtal or Zähringen. The reasons for the degradation were religious and political. Whereas Gundelfingen and Reutebach were Badish, Wildtal and Zähringen belonged to Further Austria. As a result of the reformation, Baden became protestant and hence Reutebach a religious enclave.

Most of the territory that once constituted Reutebach now belongs to Zähringen. Leftovers of the church of Reutebach were discovered under the parking lot in the &quot;Harbuckweg&quot; (which branches off from the &quot;Pochgasse&quot;) in the forest of Zähringen just across the bridge over the Reutebach. In the past the villages Zähringen, Wildtal, and Gundelfingen belonged to the former parish of Reutebach.

The aforementioned parking lot is also a trailhead for walks to the Reutebacher Höfe and other spots on the Roßkopf such as the &quot;Roßkopfturm&quot;.

====Rottecksruhe====
From &quot;Zähringen castle&quot; you walk through the mountain forest to a spot called &quot;Rottecksruhe&quot; (Rotteck&#x27;s rest), 1935 ft above sea level. Once there stood a farmhouse owned by Karl von Rotteck. In its place there is now a small hut where you can rest.

=== Roßkopf ===
The mountain on which you are walking is called Roßkopf (horsehead). It rises to 2418 ft above sea level.

====Roßkopfturm====
Just north of the summit of this mountain and next to a small hut, the &quot;Roßkopfturm&quot;, a 115 ft high lattice tower is standing that was built in 1889 and offers a panoramic view of Freiburg, the surrounding mountains and the Upper Rhine Valley with the Tuniberg and the Kaiserstuhl, and, on some days, when the visibility is particularly good, you can even see the Vosges on the opposite side of the Upper Rhine Valley beyond the Alsatian Plain in France.

====Martinsfelsen====
Walking towards the east you will reach the &quot;Martinsfelsen&quot; (Martin&#x27;s rock), 2250 ft above sea level, offering a good view of the northern Breisgau.

====Wind turbine====
In 2003, four wind turbines were built. One of these four wind turbines is standing on the section of the mountain which belongs to Gundelfingen. Due to these wind turbines the Roßkopf is now easily recognizable from a distance.

=== Protected area ===
A large part of the mountainous area in the east of Gundelfingen was classified as a protected area of Baden-Württemberg under the name &quot;Landschaftsschutzgebiet Gundelfingen-Wildtal-Heuweiler&quot;. Heuweiler is a neighboring village which is associated with Gundelfingen for administrative purposes.

== Religion ==
A church was mentioned in Gundelfingen for the first time in 1275. However, only since the implementation of the Reformation in the Margraviate of Baden in 1556 Gundelfingen had its own (from then on protestant) minister.

The Baptists established themselves in Gundelfingen in 1877.

The Catholic parish church &quot;Brother Klaus&quot; was built in 1975.

There is even a Russian orthodox chapel in an isolated location in the &quot;Roßwinkel&quot; which is cut off by Bundesstraße (federal highway) B 3 which is bypassing Gundelfingen in the West.

== Road traffic ==
The region has a well-developed road network:

Bundesstraße (federal highway) B 3 (from Buxtehude in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region in Northern Germany to Weil am Rhein on the Swiss border) which once crossed Gundelfingen is now bypassing it so as to tackle traffic congestion. Nevertheless, on its former course through Gundelfingen it is still called &quot;Alte&quot; (old) &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; and remains its main street connecting it with Freiburg.

Bundesstraße B 294 (from Freudenstadt in the Northern Black Forest to Freiburg) is also closely bypassing Gundelfingen and connecting it with Autobahn (motorway) A 5 (from three-leg motorway interchange &quot;Hattenbacher Dreieck&quot; near Bad Hersfeld in northeastern Hesse to Basel in Switzerland).

Moreover, there are local roads to the neighboring villages Heuweiler and Vörstetten.

== Public transport ==

=== Bus and tram ===
Gundelfingen is served by feeder buses to the tram network operated by Freiburger Verkehrs AG, OVS Schumacher, Rast Reisen and Binninger. Lines: 15 (Wildtal, &quot;Berggasse&quot; in Freiburg), 16 (industrial area oft Gundelfingen, railway station), 13 (&quot;Blumenstraße&quot; and the industrial area of Gundelfingen) and 24 (to the West of Freiburg through the industrial area &quot;Industriegebiet Freiburg Nord&quot;).

Buses to the hinterland are operated by SüdbadenBus, but practically all are bypassing Gundelfingen and you have to change in Freiburg.

In addition, bus line 201 from Freiburg to Vörstetten and further on to Reute and Nimburg (Teningen-Nimburg) which is operated by Binninger.

Near the border to Freiburg is the new terminal Station oft the tramline 2. In the morning and in the afternoon, line 5 is driving to the station, which name is &quot;Gundelfinger Straße&quot; (Street of Gundelfingen), too.
The Station is also the terminal station of the buslines 13, 15, 16, 22 (Bissier Street), 24, 25 (Hugstetten railway station), 201, 7203 (Denzlingen) and 1076 (Colmar in France).

=== Rail ===
Gundelfingen is located on the Rhine Valley Railway Line Karlsruhe - Basel and the trains of two regional train operators are stopping at its train station: DB Regio and Breisgau S-Bahn (the latter operating the line branching off to Elzach).

== Carnival==
In Gundelfingen there are two official carnival clubs:
* Gundelfinger Dorfhexen (village witches)
* Fässlistemmer (guys raising small barrels)

== Twinning ==
The first twinning arrangement was concluded in 1987 with the French town Meung-sur-Loire which has 6800 inhabitants and is located directly on the Loire approximately 19 miles from Orléans. Ten years later, in 1997, followed the Polish town Bieruń (German Berun) with approximately 20,000 inhabitants, 12 miles south of Katowice in Upper Silesia. Since 1997 a partnership has been maintained with the Saxon village Scheibenberg which has almost 2,400 residents.

<doc id="238266" wikidata="Q600068" url="?curid=238266" title="Centennial Olympic Park bombing">
<text>The Centennial Olympic Park bombing was a domestic terrorist pipe bombing attack on Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday, July 27, 1996, during the Summer Olympics. The blast directly killed one person and injured 111 others; another person later died of a heart attack. It was the first of four bombings committed by Eric Rudolph in a terrorism campaign against the U.S. government which he accused of championing &quot;the ideals of global socialism&quot; and &quot;abortion on demand&quot;. Security guard Richard Jewell discovered the bomb before detonation, notified Georgia Bureau of Investigation officers, and began clearing spectators out of the park along with other security guards.

After the bombing, Jewell was initially investigated as a suspect by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and news media aggressively focused on him as the presumed culprit when he was actually innocent. In October 1996, the FBI declared Jewell was no longer a person of interest. Following three more bombings in 1997 and 1998, Rudolph was identified by the FBI as the suspect. In 2003, Rudolph was finally captured and arrested, and in 2005 he agreed to plead guilty to avoid a potential death sentence. Rudolph was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for his crimes.

== Bombing ==

Centennial Olympic Park was designed as the &quot;town square&quot; of the Olympics, and thousands of spectators had gathered for a late concert by the band Jack Mack and the Heart Attack. Sometime after midnight, Rudolph planted a green U.S. military ALICE pack (field pack) containing three pipe bombs filled with smokeless powder surrounded by masonry nails, which caused the death of one victim and most of the human injuries, underneath a bench near the base of a concert sound tower. He then left the area.

The pack had a directed charge and could have done more damage but it was slightly moved at some point. It used a steel plate as a directional device. Investigators later tied the Sandy Springs and Otherside Lounge bombs together with this first device because all were propelled by nitroglycerin dynamite, used an alarm clock and Rubbermaid containers, and contained steel plates.

FBI Agent David (Woody) Johnson received notice that a call to 911 was placed about 18 minutes before the bomb detonated warning that a bomb would go off at the park within 30 minutes by &quot;a white male with an indistinguishable American accent&quot;.

Security guard Richard Jewell discovered the bag underneath a bench and alerted Georgia Bureau of Investigation officers. Tom Davis, of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, called in a bomb squad, including members of the ATF and FBI to investigate the suspicious bag, which was leaning against the 40-ft NBC sound tower. Jewell and other security guards began clearing the immediate area so that the bomb squad could investigate the suspicious package. The bomb detonated two to three minutes into the evacuation, before all spectators could leave the area.

The first one who gave the news live worldwide was the Italian reporter , who was in Atlanta as a correspondent of RAI Radiotelevisione Italiana for the Olympic Games that were taking place at that time.

Video of the explosion from a short distance away was captured by Robert Gee, a tourist from California, and later aired by CNN. The sound of the explosion was also recorded by a news crew from the German public television network ARD, who were interviewing American swimmer Janet Evans at a nearby hotel.

=== Victims ===
Alice Hawthorne, 44, of Albany, Georgia, was killed in the explosion when a nail from the bomb penetrated her skull and riddled her body with shrapnel while she was standing with her 14-year-old daughter who was badly injured. A cameraman with Turkish Radio and Television Corporation, Melih Uzunyol, 40, who had &quot;survived coverage of wars in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and the Persian Gulf,&quot; suffered a fatal heart attack while running to the scene. The bomb wounded 111 others.

== Reaction ==

President Bill Clinton denounced the explosion as an &quot;evil act of terror&quot; and vowed to do everything possible to track down and punish those responsible.

Despite the event, officials and athletes agreed that the games should continue as planned.

== Aftermath ==

=== Richard Jewell falsely implicated ===

Though Richard Jewell was hailed as a hero for his role in discovering the bomb and moving spectators to safety, news organizations later reported that Jewell was considered a potential suspect in the bombing, four days afterward, and shortly after a brief, mistaken detainment of two juvenile persons of interest at the Kensington MARTA station. Jewell, at the time, was unknown to authorities, and a lone wolf profile made sense to FBI investigators after they were contacted by his former employer at Piedmont College.

Jewell was named as a person of interest, although he was never arrested. Jewell&#x27;s home was searched, his background exhaustively investigated, and he became the subject of intense media interest and surveillance, including a media siege of his home.

After Jewell was exonerated, he initiated defamation lawsuits against NBC News, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, and other media entities, and insisted on a formal apology from them. Jewell&#x27;s lawsuit accused Piedmont College President Raymond Cleere of falsely describing Jewell as a &quot;badge-wearing zealot&quot; who &quot;would write epic police reports for minor infractions&quot;. The cases were later settled after 15 years of litigation with the Georgia Court of Appeals decision in July 2012, that the newspapers accurately reported that Jewell was the key suspect in the bombing, and emphasized he was only a suspect and the potential issues in the law enforcement case against him. Richard Jewell died on August 29, 2007, at the age of 44 from serious medical problems related to diabetes.

&quot;Richard Jewell&quot;, a biographical drama film, was released in the United States on December 13, 2019. The film was directed and produced by Clint Eastwood. It was written by Billy Ray, based on the 1997 article &quot;American Nightmare,&quot; and the book &quot;The Suspect: An Olympic Bombing, the FBI, the Media, and Richard Jewell, the Man Caught in the Middle&quot; (2019) by Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen. Jewell is played by Paul Walter Hauser.

A TV series, &quot;Manhunt&quot;, also called &quot;ManHunt: Deadly Games&quot;, dedicated season 2 (2020) to the story of Richard Jewell. Jewell is played by Cameron Britton.

=== Conviction of Eric Robert Rudolph ===

After Jewell was cleared, the FBI admitted it had no other suspects, and the investigation made little progress until early 1997, when two more bombings took place, at an abortion clinic and a lesbian nightclub, both in the Atlanta area. Similarities in the bomb design allowed investigators to conclude that this was the work of the same perpetrator. One more bombing of an abortion clinic, this time in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed a policeman working as a security guard and seriously injured nurse Emily Lyons, gave the FBI crucial clues including a partial license plate.

The plate and other clues led the FBI to identify Eric Robert Rudolph, a carpenter and handyman, as a suspect. Rudolph eluded capture and became a fugitive; officials believed he had disappeared into the rugged southern Appalachian Mountains, familiar from his youth. On May 5, 1998, the FBI named him as one of its ten most wanted fugitives and offered a $1 million reward for information leading directly to his arrest. On October 14, 1998, the Department of Justice formally named Rudolph as its suspect in all four bombings.

After more than five years on the run, Rudolph was arrested on May 31, 2003, in Murphy, North Carolina, by a rookie police officer, Jeffrey Scott Postell of the Murphy Police Department behind a Save-A-Lot store at about 4 a.m.; Postell, on routine patrol, had originally suspected a burglary in progress. On April 8, 2005, the government announced Rudolph would plead guilty to all four bombings, including the Centennial Olympic Park attack. Rudolph is serving four life terms without the possibility of parole at ADX Florence supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.

Rudolph&#x27;s justification for the bombings according to his April 13, 2005 statement, was political:

:In the summer of 1996, the world converged upon Atlanta for the Olympic Games. Under the protection and auspices of the regime in Washington, millions of people came to celebrate the ideals of global socialism. Multinational corporations spent billions of dollars, and Washington organized an army of security to protect these best of all games. Even though the conception and purpose of the so-called Olympic movement is to promote the values of global socialism, as perfectly expressed in the song &quot;Imagine&quot; by John Lennon, which was the theme of the 1996 Games even though the purpose of the Olympics is to promote these ideals, the purpose of the attack on July 27 was to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.

:The plan was to force the cancellation of the Games, or at least create a state of insecurity to empty the streets around the venues and thereby eat into the vast amounts of money invested.

On August 22, 2005, Rudolph, who had previously received a life sentence for the Alabama bombing, was sentenced to three concurrent terms of life imprisonment without parole for the Georgia incidents. Rudolph read a statement at his sentencing in which he apologized to the victims and families only of the Centennial Park bombing, reiterating that he was angry at the government and hoped the Olympics would be canceled. At his sentencing, fourteen other victims or relatives gave statements, including the widower of Alice Hawthorne.

Rudolph&#x27;s former sister-in-law, Deborah Rudolph, talked about the irony of Rudolph&#x27;s plea deal putting him in custody of a government he hates. &quot;Knowing that he&#x27;s living under government control for the rest of his life, I think that&#x27;s worse to him than death,&quot; she told the &quot;San Diego Union Tribune&quot; in 2005.

In February 2013, LuLu.com published Rudolph&#x27;s book, &quot;Between the Lines of Drift: The Memoirs of a Militant&quot;, and in April 2013 the U.S. Attorney General seized his $200 royalty to help pay off the $1 million that Rudolph owes in restitution to the state of Alabama.

<text>Antiphospholipid syndrome, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS or APLS), is an autoimmune, hypercoagulable state caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. APS can lead to blood clots (thrombosis) in both arteries and veins, pregnancy-related complications, and other symptoms like low platelets, kidney disease, heart disease, and rash. Although the exact etiology of APS is still not clear, genetics is believed to play a key role in the development of the disease. 

Diagnosis is made based on symptoms and testing, but sometimes research criteria are used to aid in diagnosis. The research criteria for definite APS requires one clinical event (i.e. thrombosis or pregnancy complication) and two positive blood test results spaced at least three months apart that detect lupus anticoagulant, anti-apolipoprotein antibodies, and/or anti-cardiolipin antibodies.

Antiphospholipid syndrome can be primary or secondary. 

• Primary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs in the absence of any other related disease. 

• Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. 

In rare cases, APS leads to rapid organ failure due to generalized thrombosis; this is termed &quot;catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome&quot; (CAPS or Asherson syndrome) and is associated with a high risk of death.

Antiphospholipid syndrome often requires treatment with anticoagulant medication to reduce the risk of further episodes of thrombosis and improve the prognosis of pregnancy. The anticoagulant medication used for treatment may differ depending on the circumstance, such as pregnancy.

==Signs and symptoms==
Antiphospholipid syndrome is known for causing arterial or venous blood clots, in any organ system, and pregnancy-related complications. While blood clots and pregnancy complications are the most common and diagnostic symptoms associated with APS, other organs and body parts may be affected like platelet levels, heart, kidneys, brain, and skin. Also, people with APS may have symptoms associated with other autoimmune diseases like lupus erythematosus that are not caused by APS because APS can occur at the same time as other autoimmune diseases.

=== Blood clots ===
In APS patients, the most common venous event is deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities, and the most common arterial event is stroke. People with a blot clot in their extremities may experience swelling, pain, or redness in the affected area. People experiencing a stroke can experience a variety of symptoms depending on what blood vessel in the brain is affected. Symptoms include but are not limited to trouble speaking, loss of sensation, or weakness in one side of the face or body. Blood clots can also occur in the lungs, which may cause trouble breathing or chest pain, and they can occur in the heart, which could lead to a heart attack.

Blood clots in patients with APS are often considered unprovoked, which means they occur in the absence of conditions that typically cause blood clots (i.e. prolonged sedentary behavior, immoblization, infection, cancer). However, a person can develop a provoked blood clot while having APS due to APS causing an increased risk of blood clot development. Exogenous estrogen therapies, such as estrogen-based contraceptives, significantly increase the risk of developing blood clots for patients with APS. 

=== Pregnancy-related complications ===
In pregnant people affected by APS, there is an increased risk of recurrent miscarriage, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia. Recurrent miscarriages associated with APS typically occur prior to 10th week of gestation, but miscarriage associated with APS can also occur after the 10th week of gestation. Certain causes must be excluded prior to attributing these complications to APS. Also, in pregnant individuals with lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome is responsible for most of the miscarriages in later trimesters.

=== Other symptoms ===
Other common findings that suggest APS are low platelet count, heart valve disease, high blood pressure in the lungs, kidney disease, and a rash called livedo reticularis. There are also associations between antiphospholipid antibodies and different neurologic manifestations including headache, migraine, epilepsy, and dementia although more research is needed to prove that these symptoms are indicative of APS. Cancer is also observed to occur at the same time in some patients with APS.

==Mechanisms==
Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disease, in which &quot;antiphospholipid antibodies&quot; react against proteins that bind to anionic phospholipids on plasma membranes. Anticardiolipin antibodies, β2glycoprotein 1, and lupus anticoagulant are antiphospholipid antibodies that are thought to clinically cause disease. These antibodies lead to blood clots and vascular disease in the presence (secondary APS) or absence (primary APS) of other diseases. While the exact functions of the antibodies are not known, the activation of the coagulation system is evident.

Anti-ApoH and a subset of anti-cardiolipin antibodies bind to ApoH. ApoH inhibits protein C, a glycoprotein with important regulatory function of coagulation (inactivates Factor Va and Factor VIIIa). Lupus anticoagulant antibodies bind to prothrombin, thus increasing its cleavage to thrombin, its active form.

Other antibodies associated with APS include antibodies against protein S and annexin A5. Protein S is a co-factor of protein C, which is one of the body&#x27;s own anti-clotting factors. Annexin A5 forms a shield around negatively charged phospholipid molecules, which reduces the membrane&#x27;s ability to participate in clotting. Thus, antibodies against protein S and anti-annexin A5 decrease protein C efficiency and increase phospholipid-dependent coagulation steps respectively, which leads to increased clotting potential.

The lupus anticoagulant antibodies are those that show the closest association with thrombosis; those that target β2glycoprotein 1 have a greater association with thrombosis than those that target prothrombin.
Anticardiolipin antibodies are associated with thrombosis at moderate to high titres (over 40 GPLU or MPLU).
Patients with both lupus anticoagulant antibodies and moderate or high titre anticardiolipin antibodies show a greater risk of thrombosis than with one alone.

The increased risks of recurrent miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction and preterm birth by antiphospholipid antibodies, as supported by &quot;in vitro&quot; studies, include decreased trophoblast viability, syncytialization and invasion, deranged production of hormones and signalling molecules by trophoblasts, as well as activation of coagulation and complement pathways.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is often made through the combination of symptoms and testing. Repeat antibody testing 12 weeks after discovering the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) is needed to establish a diagnosis because false positives can occur.

While APS was previously categorized into primary and secondary APS based on the absence or presence of concurrent autoimmune disease respectively, the 16th International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies Task Force categorizes APS into 6 categories:
* no symptoms in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies
* pregnancy related
* blood clot (venous or arterial) related
* microvascular (small blood vessel)
* catastrophic
* non-blood clot (i.e. kidney, low platelets, heart valve disease) related

In their report, they acknowledge that some individuals may qualify for more than one category based on symptoms.

=== Research criteria ===
Because there are no agreed upon diagnostic criteria for APS, research classification criteria are sometimes used to aid in diagnosis. The Sapporo APS classification criteria (1998, published in 1999) were replaced by the Sydney criteria in 2006. The Sydney criteria requires one clinical (thrombosis or pregnancy related) manifestation and persistent presence of one or more APS antibody. In the 2023 American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism joint criteria they added heart related symptoms and low platelet levels as clinical criteria and changed some thresholds and specifics for antibody testing. However, all previously proposed research criteria are meant to create a standardized group of individuals with APS in order to increase accuracy in statistical analysis, so the criteria are not be representative of all individuals with APS. Thus, people who do not meet all of the criteria could still have APS.

In terms of catastropic APS, the International Consensus Statement is commonly used for diagnosis. Based on this statement, Definite CAPS diagnosis requires:
* Blood clot in three or more organs or tissues and      
* Development of manifestations simultaneously or in less than a week and
* Evidence of small vessel blood clot in at least one organ or tissue and
* Laboratory confirmation of the presence of aPL.

=== Lab testing ===
Antiphospholipid antibody tests are either liquid-phase coagulation assays to detect lupus anticoagulant or solid phase ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to detect anti-cardiolipin antibodies and β2 glycoprotein 1. The use of testing for antibodies specific for individual targets of aPL such as phosphatidylserine is currently under debate.[]

==== Lupus anticoagulant ====
This is tested for by using two coagulation tests that are phospholipid-sensitive, due to the heterogeneous nature of the lupus anticoagulant antibodies. A patient with lupus anticoagulant antibodies on initial screening will typically have been found to have a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) that does not correct in an 80:20 mixture with normal human plasma (50:50 mixes with normal plasma are insensitive to all but the highest antibody levels). The PTT (plus 80:20 mix), dilute Russell&#x27;s viper venom time, silica clotting time and prothrombin time (using a lupus-sensitive thromboplastin) are the principal tests used for the detection of lupus anticoagulant. The Scientific and Standardization Committee for lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis no longer recommends the kaolin clotting time, dilute thromboplastin time, and Taipan/Ecarin snake venom based assays due to implementation issues from a variety of factors.

Distinguishing a lupus &lt;ins&gt;anticoagulant &lt;/ins&gt;antibody from a specific coagulation factor inhibitor (e.g.: factor VIII) is normally achieved by differentiating the effects of a lupus anticoagulant on factor assays from the effects of a specific coagulation factor antibody. The lupus anticoagulant will inhibit all the contact activation pathway factors (factor VIII, factor IX, factor XI and factor XII). Lupus anticoagulant will also rarely cause a factor assay to give a result lower than 35 iu/dl (35%) whereas a specific factor antibody will rarely give a result higher than 10 iu/dl (10%). Monitoring IV anticoagulant therapy by the PTT ratio is compromised due to the effects of the lupus anticoagulant and in these situations is generally best performed using a chromogenic assay based on the inhibition of factor Xa by antithrombin in the presence of heparin.[]

==== Anticardiolipin and β2glycoprotein 1 antibodies ====
Anti-cardiolipin antibodies can be detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunological test, which screens for the presence of β2glycoprotein 1 dependent anticardiolipin antibodies. A low platelet count and positivity for antibodies against phosphatidylserine may also be observed in a positive diagnosis.

==== False results ====
The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies may not indicate APS, which is why considering the symptoms present and retesting antibody levels is essential. People may be transiently positive, incorrectly positive, or incorrectly negative if they are tested when the following is occurring:
* infection
* pregnancy
* blood clot
* states in which acute-phase proteins, bilirubin, or fats are elevated
* anticoagulation (i.e. warfarin, heparin)

It is recommended to generally re-test people 12 weeks after the first positive test to confirm that it was correct, except for those who test positive during pregnancy. For that group, it is recommend to wait 3 months to re-test if possible. Re-testing is more nuanced if the person is taking an anticoagulant, which may require not taking the medication for a certain period of time or specifically timing the test.

Also, patients who have certain antiphospholipid antibodies may have false positive VDRL test, which aims to detect a syphilis infection. This occurs because the aPL bind to the lipids in the test and make it come out positive. A more specific test for syphilis, FTA-Abs, will not have a false-positive result in the presence of aPL.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
For people with blood clot related APS, other conditions that can cause blood clots should be considered including but not limited to acquired blood clots, genetic thrombophilia, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Genetic thrombophilia can coexist in some patients with APS.&quot;citation needed]&quot; For people with pregnancy related APS, other causes of recurrent miscarriage should be considered before the diagnosis of APS, such as genetic, structural, or immune abnormalities.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on a person&#x27;s APS symptoms. Typically a medication that decreases the body&#x27;s ability to form blood clots is given to prevent future clots. Low dose aspirin can be given to people who have APS antibodies but no symptoms, high risk individuals with lupus erythematosus and APS antibodies but no symptoms of APS, and non-pregnant people who had APS during pregnancy. For those people with APS who have had a blood clot (venous or arterial), anticoagulants such as warfarin are used to prevent future clots. If warfarin is used, the INR is kept between 2.0 and 3.0. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants may be used as an alternative to warfarin, but not in people with APS who had a previous arterial blood clot or are &quot;triple positive&quot; with all types of antiphospholipid antibody (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibody). In people with arterial blood clot related APS, using direct-acting oral anticoagulants has shown to increase the risk of future arterial blood clots and should not be used.

In pregnant women with only pregnancy related APS or only past blood clot related APS, low molecular weight heparin and low-dose aspirin are used instead of warfarin because of warfarin&#x27;s ability to cause birth defects. Heparin and aspirin together appears to make miscarriage less likely in pregnant women with APS. Women with recurrent miscarriages are often advised to take aspirin and to start low molecular weight heparin treatment after missing a menstrual cycle.[] In refractory cases plasmapheresis may be used.[]

==Prognosis==
Factors that increase likelihood of developing APS related future blood clots and pregnancy complications include:
* presence of all three antibodies (β2 glycoprotein 1, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin)
* moderate to high levels of an APS antibody
* presence of IgG APS antibodies

Also, a history of previous blood clots in someone with APS increases the risk for certain pregnancy complications, such as death of the child, smaller sized baby, and blood clots during and after pregnancy. Outside of people with APS having an increased risk of blood clots and pregnancy complications, people with APS generally have increased risk of atherosclerotic disease.

Other risk stratification criteria for predicting blood clots and pregnancy complications have been proposed, such as the aPL Score and the Global APS score, but further data is needed to validate these tools.

== Epidemiology ==
Factors associated with developing antiphospholipid syndrome include:
* Genetic Markers: HLA-DR4, HLA-DR7, and HLA-DRw53
* Race: Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans
* Sex: female 
* Age: 30-40s 
In a study of 1000 patients, only 12.7% were diagnosed after the age of 50.

==History==
Antiphospholipid syndrome was described in full in the 1980s, by E. Nigel Harris and Aziz Gharavi. They published the first papers in 1983. The syndrome was referred to as &quot;Hughes syndrome&quot; among colleagues after the rheumatologist Graham R.V. Hughes (St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London, UK), who brought together the team.

==Research==
According to a 2006 Sydney consensus statement, it is advisable to classify APS into one of the following categories for research purposes:
* I: more than one laboratory criterion present in any combination;
* IIa: lupus anticoagulant present alone
* IIb: anti-cardiolipin IgG and/or IgM present alone in medium or high titers
* IIc: anti-β2 glycoprotein I IgG and/or IgM present alone in a titer greater than 99th percentile

<doc id="238274" wikidata="Q14920463" url="?curid=238274" title="Charales">
<text>Charales is an order of freshwater green algae in the division Charophyta, class Charophyceae, commonly known as stoneworts. Depending on the treatment of the genus &quot;Nitellopsis&quot;, living (extant) species are placed into either one family (Characeae) or two (Characeae and Feistiellaceae). Further families are used for fossil members of the order. Linnaeus established the genus &quot;Chara&quot; in 1753.

==Taxonomy==
The higher level classification of green algae was unsettled . AlgaeBase places Charales within the class Charophyceae and its circumscription of the division Charophyta.

===Families===
The number of families and their division into genera varies. , AlgaeBase accepts two families containing some extant species and four families containing only fossil species:
*Characeae 
*Feistiellaceae 
*†Aclistocharaceae (may be included in Characeae)
*†Atopocharaceae (may be included in Clavatoraceae)
*†Clavatoraceae 
*†Porocharaceae 
AlgaeBase places the genus &quot;Nitellopsis&quot;, which has both extant and extinct species, in the family Feistiellaceae. Other sources place &quot;Nitellopsis&quot; in the family Characeae, with Feistiellaceae containing only fossil species, so that all extant species are in the family Characeae. The Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera accepts a further three extinct families:
*†Eocharaceae 
*†Palaeocharaceae 
*†Raskyellaceae 

== Fossil record ==
Body fossils of representatives of the order Charales do exist, but are rare. The fossil record of the Charales consists mostly of gyrogonites, that is, calcified fructifications or, more exactly, calcified spiral cells surrounding the oospores. It may be noted that the gyrogonites are studied by palaeontologists, but not often destroyed (using acids) during neontological research to liberate the oospores.

The oldest known representative of the Charales is &quot;Eochara wickendenii&quot; from the Middle Devonian. The family Characeae starts dominating the fossil assemblages in the Paleogene or perhaps already in the Late Cretaceous.

<doc id="238277" wikidata="Q6938260" url="?curid=238277" title="Murdrum">
<text>Murdrum was the crime of murdering someone in a secret manner in medieval English law.

==Origins==
It was introduced into Anglo-Saxon law by the Danes. It is distinguished from simple homicide. In the laws of Cnut an unknown man who was killed was presumed to be a Dane, and the vill or tithing was compelled to pay 40 marks for his death.

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, the law was revived to protect the Anglo-Normans. The origins of the Norman law are described in the 12th-century Dialogus de Scaccario:

In later years, the Anglo-Normans became indistinguishable from the native English. Nevertheless, the murdrum was retained as the most effective law against secret murder (as opposed to open murder that could be handled by the hue and cry) no matter the victim&#x27;s ethnicity.

== Exemptions and abolition ==
When King Henry I granted tax liberties to London in 1133, he exempted the city from taxes such as scot, danegeld, and murdrum. Richard I of England exempted the Knights Templar from being charged with murdrum and &quot;Latrocinium&quot; amongst other privileges. The murdrum was abolished in the reign of Edward III.

<doc id="238280" wikidata="Q1369527" url="?curid=238280" title="Lucilius Junior">
<text>Lucilius Junior (fl. 1st century), was the procurator of Sicily during the reign of Nero, a friend and correspondent of Seneca, and the possible author of &quot;Aetna&quot;, a poem that survives in a corrupt state.

==Life==
The information about Lucilius comes from Seneca&#x27;s writings, especially his &quot;Moral Letters&quot;, which are addressed to Lucilius. Seneca also dedicated his &quot;Naturales Quaestiones&quot; and his essay &quot;De Providentia&quot; to Lucilius. Lucilius seems to have been a native of Campania, and Seneca refers repeatedly to &quot;your beloved Pompeii.&quot; At the time Seneca wrote his &quot;Letters&quot; (c. 65 AD), Lucilius was the procurator (and possibly governor) of Sicily. He was a Roman Knight, a status he had achieved through &quot;persistent work,&quot; and he owned a country villa in Ardea, south of Rome. Seneca devotes one of his shorter letters to praising a book Lucilius had written, and elsewhere quotes a few lines of Lucilius&#x27; poetry.

==&quot;Aetna&quot;==
&quot;Aetna&quot; is a 644-line poem on the origin of volcanic activity, which has been variously attributed to Virgil, Cornelius Severus, and Manilius.

Its composition has been placed as far back as 44 BC, on the ground that certain works of art, known to have been removed to Rome about that date, are referred to as being at a distance from the city. But as the author appears to have known and made use of the &quot;Quaestiones Naturales&quot; of Seneca (written c. 65 AD), and no mention is made of the great eruption of Vesuvius (AD 79), the time of its composition seems to lie between these two dates. In favor of the authorship of Lucilius are the facts that he was a friend of Seneca and acquainted with his writings; that he had for some time held the office of imperial procurator of Sicily, and was thus familiar with the locality; and that he was the author of a poem on Sicilian subjects. It is objected that in the 79th letter of Seneca, which is the chief authority on the question, he apparently asks that Lucilius should introduce the hackneyed theme of &quot;Aetna&quot; merely as an episode in his contemplated poem, not make it the subject of separate treatment. The sources of the &quot;Aetna&quot; are Posidonius of Apamea, and perhaps the pseudo-Aristotelian &quot;De Mundo&quot;, while there are many reminiscences of Lucretius. It has come down in a very corrupt state, and its difficulties are increased by the unpoetical nature of the subject, the straining after conciseness, and the obtrusive use of metaphor.

<text>Gnetophyta () is a division of plants (alternatively considered the subclass Gnetidae or order Gnetales), grouped within the gymnosperms (which also includes conifers, cycads, and ginkgos), that consists of some 70 species across the three relict genera: &quot;Gnetum&quot; (family Gnetaceae), &quot;Welwitschia&quot; (family Welwitschiaceae), and &quot;Ephedra&quot; (family Ephedraceae). The earliest unambiguous records of the group date to the Jurassic, and they achieved their highest diversity during the Early Cretaceous. The primary difference between gnetophytes and other gymnosperms is the presence of vessel elements, a system of small tubes (xylem) that transport water within the plant, similar to those found in flowering plants. Because of this, gnetophytes were once thought to be the closest gymnosperm relatives to flowering plants, but more recent molecular studies have brought this hypothesis into question, with many recent phylogenies finding them to be nested within the conifers.

Though it is clear they are all related, the exact evolutionary inter-relationships between gnetophytes are unclear. Some classifications hold that all three genera should be placed in a single order (Gnetales), while other classifications say they should be distributed among three separate orders, each containing a single family and genus. Most morphological and molecular studies confirm that the genera &quot;Gnetum&quot; and &quot;Welwitschia&quot; diverged from each other more recently than they did from &quot;Ephedra&quot;.



==Ecology and morphology==
Unlike most biological groupings, it is difficult to find many common characteristics between all of the members of the gnetophytes. The two common characteristics most commonly used are the presence of enveloping bracts around both the ovules and microsporangia as well as a micropylar projection of the outer membrane of the ovule that produces a pollination droplet, though these are highly specific compared to the similarities between most other plant divisions. L. M. Bowe refers to the gnetophyte genera as a &quot;bizarre and enigmatic&quot; trio because the gnetophytes&#x27; specialization to their respective environments is so complete that they hardly resemble each other at all. &quot;Gnetum&quot; species are mostly woody vines in tropical forests, though the best-known member of this group, &quot;Gnetum gnemon&quot;, is a tree native to western Malesia. The one remaining species of &quot;Welwitschia&quot;, &quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot;, native only to the dry deserts of Namibia and Angola, is a ground-hugging species with only two large strap-like leaves that grow continuously from the base throughout the plant&#x27;s life. &quot;Ephedra&quot; species, known as &quot;jointfirs&quot; in the United States, have long slender branches which bear tiny scale-like leaves at their nodes. Infusions from these plants have been traditionally used as a stimulant, but ephedrine is a controlled substance today in many places because of the risk of harmful or even fatal overdosing.

==Classification==
With just three well-defined genera within an entire division, there still is understandable difficulty in establishing an unambiguous interrelationship among them; in earlier times matters were even more difficult, with Pearson in the early 20th century discussing about the class Gnetales, rather than the order. G.H.M. Lawrence referred to them as an order, but remarked that the three families were distinct enough to deserve recognition as separate orders. Foster &amp; Gifford accepted this principle, and placed the three orders together in a common class for convenience, which they called Gnetopsida. In general the evolutionary relationships among the seed plants still are unresolved, and the Gnetophyta have played an important role in the formation of phylogenetic hypotheses. Molecular phylogenies of extant gymnosperms have conflicted with morphological characters with regard to whether the gymnosperms as a whole (including gnetophytes) comprise a monophyletic group or a paraphyletic one that gave rise to angiosperms. At issue is whether the Gnetophyta are the sister group of angiosperms, or whether they are sister to, or nested within, other extant gymnosperms. Numerous fossil gymnosperm clades once existed that are morphologically at least as distinctive as the four living gymnosperm groups, such as Bennettitales, &quot;Caytonia&quot; and the glossopterids. When these gymnosperm fossils are considered, the question of gnetophyte relationships to other seed plants becomes even more complicated. Several hypotheses, illustrated below, have been presented to explain seed plant evolution. Some morphological studies have supported a close relationship between Gnetophyta, Bennettitales and the Erdtmanithecales.

Recent research by Lee, Cibrian-Jaramillo, &quot;et al.&quot; (2011) suggests that the Gnetophyta are a sister group to the rest of the gymnosperms, contradicting the anthophyte hypothesis, which held that gnetophytes were sister to the flowering plants.

===Gnetifer hypothesis===
In the gnetifer hypothesis, the gnetophytes are sister to the conifers, and the gymnosperms are a monophyletic group, sister to the angiosperms.The gnetifer hypothesis first emerged formally in the mid-twentieth century, when vessel elements in the gnetophytes were interpreted as being derived from tracheids with circular bordered pits, as in conifers. It however only gained strong support with the emergence of molecular data in the late 1990s. Although the most salient morphological evidence still largely supports the anthophyte hypothesis, some more obscure morphological commonalities between the gnetophytes and conifers lend support to the gnetifer hypothesis.These shared traits include: tracheids with scalariform pits with tori interspersed with annular thickenings, absence of scalariform pitting in primary xylem, scale-like and strap-shaped leaves of &quot;Ephedra&quot; and &quot;Welwitschia&quot;; and reduced sporophylls.

===Anthophyte hypothesis===
From the early twentieth century, the anthophyte hypothesis was the prevailing explanation for seed plant evolution, based on shared morphological characters between the gnetophytes and angiosperms. In this hypothesis, the gnetophytes, along with the extinct order Bennettitales, are sister to the angiosperms, forming the &quot;anthophytes&quot;. Some morphological characters that were suggested to unite the anthophytes include vessels in wood, net-veined leaves (in &quot;Gnetum&quot; only), lignin chemistry, the layering of cells in the apical meristem, pollen and megaspore features (including thin megaspore wall), short cambial initials, and lignin syringal groups. However, most genetic studies, as well as more recent morphological analyses, have rejected the anthophyte hypothesis.

Several of these studies have suggested that the gnetophytes and angiosperms have independently derived characters, including flower-like reproductive structures and tracheid vessel elements, that appear shared but are actually the result of parallel evolution.

===Gnepine hypothesis===
The gnepine hypothesis is a modification of the gnetifer hypothesis, and suggests that the gnetophytes belong within the conifers as a sister group to the Pinaceae. According to this hypothesis, the conifers as currently defined are not a monophyletic group, in contrast with molecular findings that support its monophyly. All existing evidence for this hypothesis comes from molecular studies since 1999. A 2018 phylogenomic study estimated the divergence between Gnetales and Pinaceae at around 241 millions of years ago, in the early Triassic while a 2021 study placed it earlier, in the Carboniferous.

However, the morphological evidence remains difficult to reconcile with the gnepine hypothesis. If the gnetophytes are nested within conifers, they must have lost several shared derived characters of the conifers (or these characters must have evolved in parallel in the other two conifer lineages): narrowly triangular leaves (gnetophytes have diverse leaf shapes), resin canals, a tiered proembryo, and flat woody ovuliferous cone scales. These kinds of major morphological changes are not without precedent in the Pinales, however: the Taxaceae, for example, have lost the classical cone of the conifers in favor of a single-terminal ovule, surrounded by a fleshy aril.

===Gnetophyte-sister hypothesis===
Some partitions of the genetic data suggest that the gnetophytes are sister to all of the other extant seed plant groups. However, there is no morphological evidence nor examples from the fossil record to support the gnetophyte-sister hypotheses.

== Fossil gnetophytes ==
Knowledge of gnetophyte history through fossil discovery has increased greatly since the 1980s. Although some fossils that have been proposed to be gnetophytes have been found as far back as the Permian, their affinities to the group are equivocal. The oldest fossils that are definitely assignable to the group date to the Late Jurassic. Overall, the fossil record of the group is richest during the Early Cretaceous, exhibiting a substantial decline during the Late Cretaceous.

<text>Richard François Philippe Brunck (30 December 1729 – 12 June 1803) was a French classical scholar.

==Biography==
Brunck was born in Strasbourg, France, educated at the Jesuits&#x27; College in Paris, and took part in the Seven Years&#x27; War as military commissary. At the age of thirty he returned to Strasbourg to resume his studies, especially Greek. He spent considerable sums of money in publishing editions of the Greek classics.

The first work he edited was the &quot;Anthologia Graeca&quot; or &quot;Analecta veterum Poetarum Graecorum&quot; (1772–1776), in which his innovations on the established mode of criticism startled European scholars. As an editor, he made no commentaries, but occupied himself only with the text. Persuaded that all faults in the language of the Greek poets came from the carelessness of copyists, wherever it seemed to him that an obscure or difficult passage might be made intelligible and easy by a change of text, he did not scruple to make the necessary alterations, whether the new reading were supported by manuscript authority or not.

He became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1777.

==Other editions==
Other works by him are editions of Anacreon (1778), several plays of the Greek tragedians, Apollonius Rhodius (1780), Aristophanes, with an excellent Latin translation (1781–1783), &quot;Gnomici poetae Graeci&quot; (1784), Sophocles (1786), with Latin translation, a work for which he received a pension of 2,000 &quot;francs&quot; from the king. He also published editions of Virgil (1785), Plautus (1788) and Terence (1797).

==French Revolution==
At the outbreak of the French Revolution, in which he took an active part, Brunck was imprisoned at Besançon, and lost his pension, being reduced to such extremes of penury that he was obliged to sell a portion of his library. In 1802 his pension was restored to him, but it came too late to prevent the sale of his remaining books.

<doc id="238285" wikidata="Q315387" url="?curid=238285" title="Frank Ramsey (mathematician)">
<text>Frank Plumpton Ramsey (; 22 February 1903 – 19 January 1930) was a British philosopher, mathematician, and economist who made major contributions to all three fields before his death at the age of 26. He was a close friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein and, as an undergraduate, translated Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; into English. He was also influential in persuading Wittgenstein to return to philosophy and Cambridge. Like Wittgenstein, he was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, the secret intellectual society, from 1921.

==Life==

Ramsey was born on 22 February 1903 in Cambridge where his father Arthur Stanley Ramsey (1867–1954), also a mathematician, was President of Magdalene College. His mother was Mary Agnes Stanley (1875–1927). He was the eldest of two brothers and two sisters, and his brother Michael Ramsey, the only one of the four siblings who was to remain Christian, later became Archbishop of Canterbury. He entered Winchester College in 1915 and later returned to Cambridge to study mathematics at Trinity College. There he became a student of John Maynard Keynes and an active member in the Apostles. In 1923, he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics, passing his examinations with the result of first class with distinction, and was named Senior Wrangler (top of his class). Easy-going, simple and modest, Ramsey had many interests besides his mathematical and scientific studies. Even as a teenager, Ramsey exhibited both a profound ability and, as attested by his brother, an extremely diverse range of interests:

In 1923, Ramsey was befriended by Geoffrey and Margaret Pyke, then on the point of founding the Malting House School in Cambridge; the Pykes took Ramsey into their family, taking him on holiday and asking him to be the godfather of their young son. Margaret found herself to be the object of his affection, Ramsey recording in his diary: 

One afternoon I went out alone with her on Lake Orta and became filled with desire and we came back and lay on two beds side by side she reading, I pretending to, but with an awful conflict in my mind. After about an hour I said (she was wearing her horn spectacles and looking superlatively beautiful in the Burne Jones style) &#x27;Margaret will you fuck with me?&#x27;
Margaret wanted time to consider his proposition and thus began an uncomfortable dance between them, which contributed to Ramsey&#x27;s depressive moods in early 1924; as a result, he travelled to Vienna for psychoanalysis. Like many of his contemporaries, including his Viennese flatmate and fellow Apostle Lionel Penrose (also in analysis with Siegfried Bernfeld), Ramsey was intellectually interested in psychoanalysis. Ramsey&#x27;s analyst was Theodor Reik, a disciple of Freud. As one of the justifications for undertaking the therapy, he asserted in a letter to his mother that unconscious impulses might affect even a mathematician&#x27;s work. While in Vienna, he made a trip to Puchberg in order to visit Wittgenstein, was befriended by the Wittgenstein family and visited A.S. Neill&#x27;s experimental school four hours from Vienna at Sonntagsberg. In the summer of 1924, he continued his analysis by joining Reik at Dobbiaco (in South Tyrol), where a fellow analysand was Lewis Namier. Ramsey returned to England in October 1924; with John Maynard Keynes&#x27;s support, he became a fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He joined a Psychoanalysis Group in Cambridge with fellow members Arthur Tansley, Lionel Penrose, Harold Jeffreys, John Rickman and James Strachey, the qualification for membership of which was a completed psychoanalysis.

Ramsey married Lettice Baker in August 1925, the wedding taking place in a Register Office since Ramsey was, as his wife described him, a &#x27;militant atheist&#x27;. The marriage produced two daughters. After Ramsey&#x27;s death, Lettice Ramsey opened a photography studio in Cambridge with photographer Helen Muspratt. Despite his atheism, Ramsey was &quot;quite tolerant&quot; towards his brother when the latter decided to become a priest in the Church of England.

In 1926 he became a university lecturer in mathematics and later a Director of Studies in Mathematics at King&#x27;s College. The Vienna Circle manifesto (1929) lists three of his publications in a bibliography of closely related authors.

==Ramsey and Wittgenstein==

When I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden, both Fellows of Magdalene, first met Ramsey, he expressed his interest in learning German. According to Richards, he mastered the language &quot;in almost hardly over a week&quot;, although other sources show he had taken one year of German in school. Ramsey was then able, at the age of 19, to make the first draft of the translation of the German text of Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;. Ramsey was impressed by Wittgenstein&#x27;s work and after graduating as Senior Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos of 1923 he made a journey to Austria to visit Wittgenstein, at that time teaching in a primary school in the small community of Puchberg am Schneeberg. For two weeks Ramsey discussed the difficulties he was facing in understanding the &quot;Tractatus&quot;. Wittgenstein made some corrections to the English translation in Ramsey&#x27;s copy and some annotations and changes to the German text that subsequently appeared in the second edition in 1933.

Ramsey and John Maynard Keynes cooperated to try to bring Wittgenstein back to Cambridge (he had been a student there before World War I). Once Wittgenstein had returned to Cambridge, Ramsey became his nominal supervisor. Wittgenstein submitted the &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; as his doctoral thesis. G.E. Moore and Bertrand Russell acted as examiners. Later, the three of them arranged financial aid for Wittgenstein to help him continue his research work.

In 1929 Ramsey and Wittgenstein regularly discussed issues in mathematics and philosophy with Piero Sraffa, an Italian economist who had been brought to Cambridge by Keynes after Sraffa had aroused Benito Mussolini&#x27;s ire by publishing an article critical of the Fascist regime in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. The contributions of Ramsey to these conversations were acknowledged by both Sraffa and Wittgenstein in their later work.

In the introduction to &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; Wittgenstein credits Ramsey&#x27;s criticism of the &quot;Tractatus&quot; in the &quot;interminable conversations&quot; they had as having helped him realise &quot;grave mistakes&quot; within the work.

==Early death==

Suffering chronic liver problems, Ramsey developed jaundice after an abdominal operation and died on 19 January 1930 at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London at the age of 26. There is a suspicion that the cause of his death might be an undiagnosed leptospirosis with which Ramsey, an avid swimmer, could have become infected while swimming in the Cam.

He is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge; his parents are buried in the same plot.

Ramsey&#x27;s notes and manuscripts were acquired by Nicholas Rescher for the Archives of Scientific Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh. This collection contains only a few letters but a great many drafts of papers and book chapters, some still unpublished. Other papers, including his diary and letters and memoirs by his widow Lettice Ramsey and his father, are held in the Modern Archives, King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Work==

===Mathematical logic===
One of the theorems proved by Ramsey in his 1928 paper &quot;On a Problem of Formal Logic&quot; now bears his name (Ramsey&#x27;s theorem). While this theorem is the work Ramsey is probably best remembered for, he proved it only in passing, as a minor lemma along the way to his true goal in the paper, solving a special case of the decision problem for first-order logic, namely the decidability of what is now called the Bernays–Schönfinkel–Ramsey class of first-order logic, as well as a characterisation of the spectrum of sentences in this fragment of logic. Alonzo Church would go on to show that the general case of the decision problem for first-order logic is unsolvable and that first-order logic is undecidable (see Church&#x27;s theorem). A great amount of later work in mathematics was fruitfully developed out of the ostensibly minor lemma used by Ramsey in his decidability proof: this lemma turned out to be an important early result in combinatorics, supporting the idea that within some sufficiently large systems, however disordered, there must be some order. So fruitful, in fact, was Ramsey&#x27;s theorem that today there is an entire branch of mathematics, known as Ramsey theory, which is dedicated to studying similar results.

In 1926, Ramsey proposed a simplification of the Theory of Types developed by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. The resulting theory is known today as Theory of Simple Type (TST) or Simple Type Theory. Ramsey observed that a hierarchy of types was sufficient to deal with mathematical paradoxes, so removed Russell&#x27;s and Whitehead&#x27;s ramified hierarchy, which was meant to elude semantic paradoxes. Ramsey&#x27;s version of the theory is the one considered by Kurt Gödel in the original proof of his first incompleteness theorem. Ramsey&#x27;s Theory of Simple Types was further simplified by Willard van Orman Quine in his New Foundations for set theory, in which any explicit reference to types is eliminated from the language of the theory.

===Philosophy===
His main philosophical works included &quot;Universals&quot; (1925), &quot;Facts and Propositions&quot; (1927) (which proposed a redundancy theory of truth), &quot;Universals of Law and of Fact&quot; (1928), &quot;Knowledge&quot; (1929), &quot;Theories&quot; (1929), &quot;On Truth&quot; (1929), &quot;Causal Qualities&quot; (1929), and &quot;General Propositions and Causality&quot; (1929). Ramsey was perhaps the first to propose a reliabilist theory of knowledge. He also produced what philosopher Alan Hájek has described as an &quot;enormously influential version of the subjective interpretation of probability&quot;. His thought in this area was outlined in the paper &quot;Truth and Probability&quot; (discussed below) which was written in 1926 but first published posthumously in 1931.

===Economics===

Keynes and Pigou encouraged Ramsey to work on economics as &quot;From a very early age, about sixteen I think, his precocious mind was intensely interested in economic problems&quot; (Keynes, 1933). Ramsey responded to Keynes&#x27;s urging by writing three papers in economic theory all of which were of fundamental importance, though it was many years before they received their proper recognition by the community of economists.

Ramsey&#x27;s three papers, described below in detail, were on subjective probability and utility (1926), optimal taxation (1927) and optimal growth in a one-sector economy (1928). The economist Paul Samuelson described them in 1970 as &quot;three great legacies – legacies that were for the most part mere by-products of his major interest in the foundations of mathematics and knowledge.&quot;

Ramsey&#x27;s economic views were socialist.

====&quot;Truth and Probability&quot;====
In &quot;A Treatise on Probability&quot; (1921), Keynes argued against the subjective approach in epistemic probabilities. For Keynes, the subjectivity of probabilities does not matter as much, as for him there is an objective relationship between knowledge and probabilities, as knowledge is disembodied and not personal.

Ramsey disagreed with this approach. In his article &quot;Truth and Probability&quot; (1926), he argued that there is a difference between the notions of probability in physics and in logic. For Ramsey, probability is not related to a disembodied body of knowledge but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus personal beliefs that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of subjective probability and Bayesian probability. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals&#x27; personal beliefs. Ramsey argued that the degree of probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what odds the individual would accept when betting on that outcome.
Ramsey suggested a way of deriving a consistent theory of choice under uncertainty that could isolate beliefs from preferences while still maintaining subjective probabilities, although Ramsey later noted that &quot;taking the whole field of chance events no generalizations about them are possible (consider e.g. infectious diseases, dactyls in hexameters, deaths from horse kicks, births of great men).&quot;

Despite the fact that Ramsey&#x27;s work on probabilities was of great importance, no one paid any attention to it until the publication of &quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot; by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 1944 (1947 2nd ed.), although after Ramsey&#x27;s death, an approach to probability similar to his was developed independently by the Italian mathematician Bruno de Finetti.

====&quot;A Contribution to the Theory of Taxation&quot;====

This paper, first published in 1927 has been described by Joseph E. Stiglitz as &quot;a landmark in the economics of public finance&quot; In the same, Ramsey contributed to economic theory the elegant concept of Ramsey pricing. This is applicable in situations where a (regulated) monopolist wants to maximise consumer surplus whilst at the same time ensuring that its costs are adequately covered. This is achieved by setting the price such that the markup over marginal cost is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand for that good. Ramsey poses the question that is to be solved at the beginning of the article: &quot;A given revenue is to be raised by proportionate taxes on some or all uses of income, the taxes on different uses being possibly at different rates; how much should these rates be adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be a minimum?&quot; The problem was suggested to him by the economist Arthur Pigou and the paper was Ramsey&#x27;s answer to the problem.

====&quot;A Mathematical Theory of Saving&quot;====

Described by Partha Dasgupta, in a &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; entry devoted to it, as &quot;one of the dozen or so most influential papers of the 20th century&quot; in the field of academic economics, &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Saving&quot; was originally published in &quot;The Economic Journal&quot; in 1928. It employed, as Paul Samuelson described it, &quot;a strategically beautiful application of the calculus of variations&quot; to determine the optimal amount an economy should invest rather than consume so as to maximise future utility, or as Ramsey put it, &quot;How much of its income should a nation save?&quot;

Keynes described the article as &quot;one of the most remarkable contributions to mathematical economics ever made, both in respect of the intrinsic importance and difficulty of its subject, the power and elegance of the technical methods employed, and the clear purity of illumination with which the writer&#x27;s mind is felt by the reader to play about its subject. The article is terribly difficult reading for an economist, but it is not difficult to appreciate how scientific and aesthetic qualities are combined in it together.&quot; The Ramsey model is today acknowledged as the starting point for optimal accumulation theory although its importance was not recognised until many years after its first publication.

The main contributions of the model were firstly the initial question Ramsey posed on how much savings should be and secondly the method of analysis, the intertemporal maximisation (optimisation) of collective or individual utility by applying techniques of dynamic optimisation. Tjalling C. Koopmans and David Cass modified the Ramsey model incorporating the dynamic features of population growth at a steady rate and of Harrod-neutral technical progress again at a steady rate, giving birth to a model named the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model where the objective now is to maximise household&#x27;s utility function.

==Legacy==

=== Frank P. Ramsey Medal ===
The Decision Analysis Society annually awards the Frank P. Ramsey Medal to recognise substantial contributions to decision theory and its application to important classes of real decision problems.

===Frank Ramsey Professorships===
Howard Raiffa was made the first Frank P. Ramsey Professor (of Managerial Economics) at Harvard University. Richard Zeckhauser was made the Frank P. Ramsey Professor of Political Economy at Harvard University in 1971. Raiffa&#x27;s chair was joint between the Harvard Business and Kennedy Schools. Zeckhauser&#x27;s chair is in the Kennedy School. Partha Dasgupta was made the Frank Ramsey Professor of Economics in 1994 and Frank Ramsey Professor Emeritus of Economics in 2010 at the University of Cambridge.

===Ramsey Effect===
In 1999, the philosopher Donald Davidson gave the name &quot;Ramsey Effect&quot; to anyone&#x27;s realisation that their splendid new philosophical discovery already existed within Frank Ramsey&#x27;s body of work.

<text>Samuel Musgrave, FRS (29 September 1732 – 5 July 1780) was an English classical scholar and physician.

He was born at Washfield, Devon, the son of Richard Musgrave. He matriculated at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1749; and graduated B.A. from Corpus Christi College in 1754. He was elected to a Radcliffe travelling fellowship, at University College. 

Musgrave spent about a decade abroad. At the period when the Treaty of Paris (1763) was signed, Musgrave was resident in Paris. He formed a theory that British representatives had sold out to the French, allowing a treaty unfavourable to British interests. He brought his theory to the attention of Lord Halifax, and the Speaker of the House of Commons, when he returned to England in 1765. In 1766 he settled at Exeter, but moved to Plymouth to improve his career prospects. 

In an attempt to gain traction for his theory on the treaty, Musgrave published in 1769 a pamphlet in the form of an address to the people of Devon, accusing certain members of the British government of having been bribed by the French government. A further pamphlet involved Charles d&#x27;Eon de Beaumont, the French minister plenipotentiary to England. A controversy followed, and the House of Commons in 1770 decided that Musgrave&#x27;s charges were unsubstantiated. 

Musgrave then earned a living in London by writing until his death, in reduced circumstances. He wrote several medical works and his edition of Euripides (1778) was considered an advance on that of Joshua Barnes.

<doc id="238293" wikidata="Q25934" url="?curid=238293" title="Piciformes">
<text>Nine families of largely arboreal birds make up the order Piciformes , the best-known of them being the Picidae, which includes the woodpeckers and close relatives. The Piciformes contain about 71 living genera with a little over 450 species, of which the Picidae make up about half.

In general, the Piciformes are insectivorous, although the barbets and toucans mostly eat fruit and the honeyguides are unique among birds in being able to digest beeswax (although insects make up the bulk of their diet). Nearly all Piciformes have parrot-like zygodactyl feet—two toes forward and two back, an arrangement that has obvious advantages for birds that spend much of their time on tree trunks. An exception are a few species of three-toed woodpeckers. The jacamars aside, Piciformes do not have down feathers at any age, only true feathers. They range in size from the rufous piculet at 8 centimetres in length, and weighing 7 grams, to the toco toucan, at 63 centimetres long, and weighing 680 grams. All nest in cavities and have altricial young.

==Taxonomy==
The Galbulidae and Bucconidae are often separated into a distinct Galbuliformes order. Analysis of nuclear genes confirms that they form a lineage of their own, but suggests that they are better treated as a suborder. The other families form another monophyletic group of suborder rank, but the barbets were determined to be paraphyletic with regard to the toucans and hence, the formerly all-encompassing Capitonidae have been split up. The woodpeckers and honeyguides are each other&#x27;s closest relatives. According to some researchers, the entire order Piciformes should be included as a subgroup in Coraciiformes.

The phylogenetic relationship between the nine families that make up the order Piciformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
==Evolution==

Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the Piciformes has been hampered by poor understanding of the evolution of the zygodactyl foot. A number of prehistoric families and genera, from the Early Eocene &quot;Neanis&quot; and &quot;Hassiavis&quot;, the Zygodactylidae/Primoscenidae, Gracilitarsidae, Sylphornithidae, and &quot;Homalopus&quot;, to the Miocene &quot;&quot;Picus&quot; gaudryi&quot; and the Pliocene &quot;Bathoceleus&quot; are sometimes tentatively assigned to this order. There are some extinct ancestral Piciformes known from fossils which have been difficult to place but at least in part probably belong to the Pici. The modern families are known to exist since the mid-late Oligocene to early Miocene; consequently, the older forms appear to be more basal. A large part of Piciform evolution seems to have occurred in Europe where only Picidae occur today; perhaps even some now exclusively Neotropical families have their origin in the Old World.

<text>John Hutchinson (1674 – 28 August 1737) was an English theologian and natural philosopher.

He was born at Spennithorne, Yorkshire, and served as steward in several families of position, latterly in that of the Duke of Somerset, who ultimately obtained for him the post of riding purveyor to the master of the horse, a sinecure worth about £200 a year. In 1700 he became acquainted with Dr. John Woodward (1665–1728), physician to the duke and author of a work entitled &quot;The Natural History of the Earth&quot;, to whom he entrusted a large number of fossils of his own collecting, along with a mass of manuscript notes, for arrangement and publication.

A misunderstanding as to the manner in which these should be dealt with was the immediate occasion of the publication by Hutchinson in 1724 of &quot;Moses&#x27;s Principia&quot;, part i., in which Woodward&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; was bitterly ridiculed, his conduct with regard to the mineralogical specimens not obscurely characterized, and a refutation of the Newtonian doctrine of gravitation seriously attempted. It was followed by part ii. in 1727, and by various other works, including &quot;Moses&#x27;s Sine Principio&quot;, 1730; &quot;The Confusion of Tongues and Trinity of the Gentiles&quot;, 1731; &quot;Power Essential and Mechanical, or what power belongs to God and what to his creatures, in which the design of Sir Isaac Newton and Dr Samuel Clarke is laid open&quot;, 1732; &quot;Glory or Gravity&quot;, 1733; &quot;The Religion of Satan, or Antichrist Delineated&quot;, 1736.

He taught that the Bible contained the elements not only of true religion but also of all rational philosophy. He held that the Hebrew must be read without points, and his interpretation rested largely on fanciful symbolism. Bishop George Horne of Norwich was during some of his earlier years an avowed Hutchinsonian; and William Jones of Nayland continued to be so to the end of his life.

A complete edition of his publications, edited by Robert Spearman and Julius Bate, appeared in 1748 (12 vols.); an &quot;Abstract&quot; of these followed in 1753; and a &quot;Supplement&quot;, with &quot;Life&quot; by Spearman prefixed, in 1765.

Another of Hutchinson&#x27;s numerous works is &quot;The Covenant in the Cherubim: So the Hebrew Writings Perfect. Alterations by Rabbies Forged Shewing the Evidence for the Scriptures .&quot;

<text>Jan Gruter or Gruytère, Latinized as Janus Gruterus (3 December 1560 – 20 September 1627), was a Flemish-born philologist, scholar, and librarian.

==Life==
Jan Gruter was born in Antwerp. His father was Wouter Gruter, who was a merchant and city administrator of Antwerp, and his mother was Catharina Tishem from Norwich in England. To avoid religious persecution in the early stages of the Eighty Years&#x27; War, his parents emigrated to England while he was a child. For some years he studied at Caius College, Cambridge, after which he went to Leiden. In 1584 he obtained the degree of doctor iuris. He then left the Netherlands and commenced a period of travel that brought him to France, Switzerland, Italy and finally to North and East Germany. His Neo-Latin poems are published in Heidelberg at this time.

In 1590, Gruter was appointed professor of history at the University of Wittenberg. As a Calvinist, he refused to subscribe to the &quot;formula concordiae&quot;, the authoritative Lutheran statement of faith, and lost his position as a result in 1592. From 1589 to 1592, he taught at Rostock, after which he went to Heidelberg, where in 1602 he was appointed librarian to the university. He died at Bierhelderhof, Heidelberg.

==Works==
Gruter&#x27;s chief works were:
*&quot;Inscriptiones antiquae totius orbis Romani&quot; (2 vols., Heidelberg, 1603)
*&quot;Lampas, sive fax artium liberalium&quot; (7 vols., Frankfort-am-Main, 1602–1634).

<text>Factor V Leiden (rs6025 or F5 p.R506Q) is a variant (mutated form) of human factor V (one of several substances that helps blood clot), which causes an increase in blood clotting (hypercoagulability). Due to this mutation, protein C, an anticoagulant protein that normally inhibits the pro-clotting activity of factor V, is not able to bind normally to factor V, leading to a hypercoagulable state, i.e., an increased tendency for the patient to form abnormal and potentially harmful blood clots. Factor V Leiden is the most common hereditary hypercoagulability (prone to clotting) disorder amongst ethnic Europeans. It is named after the Dutch city of Leiden, where it was first identified in 1994 by Rogier Maria Bertina under the direction of (and in the laboratory of) Pieter Hendrik Reitsma. Despite the increased risk of venous thromboembolisms, people with one copy of this gene have not been found to have shorter lives than the general population. It is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with incomplete penetrance.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of factor V Leiden vary among individuals. There are some individuals who have the F5 gene and who never develop thrombosis, while others have recurring thrombosis before the age of 30 years. This variability is influenced by the number of F5 gene (chromosome 1) mutations a person has, the presence of other gene alterations related to blood clotting, and circumstantial risk factors, such as surgery, use of oral contraceptives and pregnancy.

Symptoms of factor V Leiden include:
* Having a first DVT (deep vein thrombosis) or PE (pulmonary embolism) before age 50.
* Having recurring DVT or PE.
* Having venous thrombosis in unusual sites in the body such as the brain or the liver.
* Having a DVT or PE during or right after pregnancy.
* Having a history of unexplained pregnancy loss in the second or third trimester.
* Having a DVT or PE and a strong family history of venous thromboembolism.

The use of hormones, such as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), including estrogen and estrogen-like drugs taken after menopause, increases the risk of developing DVT and PE. Healthy women taking OCPs have a three- to four-fold increased risk of developing a DVT or PE compared with women who do not take OCP. Women with factor V Leiden who take OCPs have about a 35-fold increased risk of developing a DVT or PE compared with women without factor V Leiden and those who do not take OCPs. Likewise, postmenopausal women taking HRT have a two- to three-fold higher risk of developing a DVT or PE than women who do not take HRT, and women with factor V Leiden who take HRT have a 15-fold higher risk. Women with heterozygous factor V Leiden who are making decisions about OCP or HRT use should take these statistics into consideration when weighing the risks and benefits of treatment.

==Pathophysiology==

Blood clotting, or coagulation, is a vital process that prevents excessive bleeding when a blood vessel is injured. Two primary pathways, the intrinsic and extrinsic, initiate this process. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by internal damage to the blood vessel wall, whereas the extrinsic pathway is triggered by tissue cell trauma. In both pathways, factor V functions as a cofactor to allow factor Xa to activate prothrombin, resulting in the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin in turn cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin, which polymerizes to form the dense meshwork that makes up the majority of a clot. Activated protein C is a natural anticoagulant that acts to limit the extent of clotting by cleaving and degrading factor V.

Factor V Leiden is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that exhibits incomplete penetrance, i.e. not every person who has the mutation develops the disease. The condition results in a factor V variant that cannot be as easily degraded by activated protein C. The gene that codes the protein is referred to as &quot;F5&quot;. Mutation of this gene—a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located in exon 10. As a missense substitution of amino acid R to amino acid Q, it changes the protein&#x27;s amino acid from arginine to glutamine. Depending on the chosen start the position of the nucleotide variant is either at position 1691 or 1746. It also affects the amino acid position for the variant, which is either 506 or 534. (Together with the general lack of nomenclature standard, this variance means that the SNP can be referred to in several ways, such as G1691A, c.1691G&gt;A, 1691G&gt;A, c.1746G&gt;A, p.Arg534Gln, Arg506Gln, R506Q or rs6025.) Since this amino acid is normally the cleavage site for activated protein C, the mutation prevents efficient inactivation of factor V. When factor V remains active, it facilitates overproduction of thrombin leading to generation of excess fibrin and excess clotting.

The excessive clotting that occurs in this disorder is almost always restricted to the veins, where the clotting may cause a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If the venous clots break off, these clots can travel through the right side of the heart to the lung where they block a pulmonary blood vessel and cause a pulmonary embolism. It is extremely rare for this disorder to cause the formation of clots in arteries that can lead to stroke or heart attack, though a &quot;mini-stroke&quot;, known as a transient ischemic attack, is more common. Given that this disease displays incomplete dominance, those who are homozygous for the mutated allele are at a heightened risk for the events detailed above versus those who are heterozygous for the mutation.

==Diagnosis==
Suspicion of factor V Leiden being the cause for any thrombotic event should be considered in any Caucasian patient below the age of 45, or in any person with a family history of venous thrombosis. There are a few different methods by which this condition can be diagnosed. Most laboratories screen &#x27;at risk&#x27; patients with either a snake venom (e.g. dilute Russell&#x27;s viper venom time) based test or an aPTT based test. In both methods, the time it takes for blood to clot is decreased in the presence of the factor V Leiden mutation. This is done by running two tests simultaneously; one test is run in the presence of activated protein C and the other, in the absence. A ratio is determined based on the two tests and the results signify to the laboratory whether activated protein C is working or not. There is also a genetic test that can be done for this disorder. The mutation (a 1691G→A substitution) removes a cleavage site of the restriction endonuclease &quot;MnlI&quot;, so PCR, treatment with &quot;MnlI&quot;, and then DNA electrophoresis will give a diagnosis. Other PCR based assays such as iPLEX can also identify zygosity and frequency of the variant.

==Management==
As there is no cure yet, treatment is focused on prevention of thrombotic complications. Anticoagulants are not routinely recommended for people with heterozygous factor V Leiden, unless there are additional risk factors present, but are given when such an event occurs. A single occurrence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in people with factor V Leiden warrants temporary anticoagulant treatment, but generally not lifelong treatment. In addition, temporary treatment with an anticoagulant such as heparin may be required during periods of particularly high risk of thrombosis, such as major surgery. People with homozygous factor V Leiden or heterozygous factor V Leiden with additional thrombophilia however should be considered for lifelong oral anticoagulation.

==Epidemiology==
Studies have found that about 5 percent of Caucasians in North America have factor V Leiden. Data have indicated that prevalence of factor V Leiden is greater among Caucasians than minority Americans. One study also suggested &quot;that the factor V‐Leiden mutation segregates in populations with significant Caucasian admixture and is rare in genetically distant non‐European groups.&quot; Up to 30 percent of patients who present with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism have this condition. The risk of developing a clot in a blood vessel depends on whether a person inherits one or two copies of the factor V Leiden mutation. Inheriting one copy of the mutation from a parent (heterozygous) increases by fourfold to eightfold the chance of developing a clot. People who inherit two copies of the mutation (homozygous), one from each parent, may have up to 80 times the usual risk of developing this type of blood clot. Considering that the risk of developing an abnormal blood clot averages about 1 in 1,000 per year in the general population, the presence of one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation increases that risk to between 3 in 1,000 to 8 in 1,000. Having two copies of the mutation may raise the risk as high as 80 in 1,000. It is unclear whether these individuals are at increased risk for &quot;recurrent&quot; venous thrombosis. While only 1 percent of people with factor V Leiden have two copies of the defective gene, these homozygous individuals have a more severe clinical condition. The presence of acquired risk factors for venous thrombosis—including smoking, use of estrogen-containing (combined) forms of hormonal contraception, and recent surgery—further increase the chance that an individual with the factor V Leiden mutation will develop DVT.

Women with factor V Leiden have a substantially increased risk of clotting in pregnancy (and on estrogen-containing birth control pills or hormone replacement) in the form of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. They also may have a small increased risk of preeclampsia, may have a small increased risk of low birth weight babies, may have a small increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth due to either clotting in the placenta, umbilical cord, or the fetus (fetal clotting may depend on whether the baby has inherited the gene) or influences the clotting system may have on placental development. Note that many of these women go through one or more pregnancies with no difficulties, while others may repeatedly have pregnancy complications, and still others may develop clots within weeks of becoming pregnant.

<doc id="238301" wikidata="Q4531118" url="?curid=238301" title="Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids">
<text>Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids is an analytical technique to separate DNA or RNA fragments by size and reactivity. Nucleic acid molecules are placed on a gel, where an electric field induces the nucleic acids (which are negatively charged due to their sugar-phosphate backbone) to migrate toward the positively charged anode. The molecules separate as they travel through the gel based on the each molecule&#x27;s size and shape. Longer molecules move more slowly because the gel resists their movement more forcefully than it resists shorter molecules. After some time, the electricity is turned off and the positions of the different molecules are analyzed.

The nucleic acid to be separated can be prepared in several ways before separation by electrophoresis. In the case of large DNA molecules, the DNA is frequently cut into smaller fragments using a DNA restriction endonuclease (or restriction enzyme). In other instances, such as PCR amplified samples, enzymes present in the sample that might affect the separation of the molecules are removed through various means before analysis. Once the nucleic acid is properly prepared, the samples of the nucleic acid solution are placed in the wells of the gel and a voltage is applied across the gel for a specified amount of time.

The DNA fragments of different lengths are visualized using a fluorescent dye specific for DNA, such as ethidium bromide. The gel shows bands corresponding to different nucleic acid molecules populations with different molecular weight. Fragment size is usually reported in &quot;nucleotides&quot;, &quot;base pairs&quot; or &quot;kb&quot; (for thousands of base pairs) depending upon whether single- or double-stranded nucleic acid has been separated. Fragment size determination is typically done by comparison to commercially available DNA markers containing linear DNA fragments of known length.

The types of gel most commonly used for nucleic acid electrophoresis are agarose (for relatively long DNA molecules) and polyacrylamide (for high resolution of short DNA molecules, for example in DNA sequencing). Gels have conventionally been run in a &quot;slab&quot; format such as that shown in the figure, but capillary electrophoresis has become important for applications such as high-throughput DNA sequencing. Electrophoresis techniques used in the assessment of DNA damage include alkaline gel electrophoresis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis.

For short DNA segments such as 20 to 60 bp double stranded DNA, running them in polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) will give better resolution (native condition). Similarly, RNA and single-stranded DNA can be run and visualised by PAGE gels containing denaturing agents such as urea. PAGE gels are widely used in techniques such as DNA foot printing, EMSA and other DNA-protein interaction techniques.

The measurement and analysis are mostly done with a specialized gel analysis software. Capillary electrophoresis results are typically displayed in a trace view called an electropherogram.

==Factors affecting migration of nucleic acids==

A number of factors can affect the migration of nucleic acids: the dimension of the gel pores, the voltage used, the ionic strength of the buffer, and the concentration intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide if used during electrophoresis.

===Size of DNA===
The gel sieves the DNA by the size of the DNA molecule whereby smaller molecules travel faster. Double-stranded DNA moves at a rate that is approximately inversely proportional to the logarithm of the number of base pairs. This relationship however breaks down with very large DNA fragments and it is not possible to separate them using standard agarose gel electrophoresis. The limit of resolution depends on gel composition and field strength. and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel. Separation of very large DNA fragments requires pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE, a kind of PFGE), it is possible to have &quot;band inversion&quot; - where large molecules may move faster than small molecules.

===Conformation of DNA===
The conformation of the DNA molecule can significantly affect the movement of the DNA, for example, supercoiled DNA usually moves faster than relaxed DNA because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact. In a normal plasmid DNA preparation, multiple forms of DNA may be present, and gel from the electrophoresis of the plasmids would normally show a main band which would be the negatively supercoiled form, while other forms of DNA may appear as minor fainter bands. These minor bands may be nicked DNA (open circular form) and the relaxed closed circular form which normally run slower than supercoiled DNA, and the single-stranded form (which can sometimes appear depending on the preparation methods) may move ahead of the supercoiled DNA. The rate at which the various forms move however can change using different electrophoresis conditions, for example linear DNA may run faster or slower than supercoiled DNA depending on conditions, and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel. Unless supercoiled DNA markers are used, the size of a circular DNA like plasmid therefore may be more accurately gauged after it has been linearized by restriction digest.

DNA damage due to increased cross-linking will also reduce electrophoretic DNA migration in a dose-dependent way.

===Concentration of ethidium bromide===

Circular DNA are more strongly affected by ethidium bromide concentration than linear DNA if ethidium bromide is present in the gel during electrophoresis. All naturally occurring DNA circles are underwound, but ethidium bromide which intercalates into circular DNA can change the charge, length, as well as the superhelicity of the DNA molecule, therefore its presence during electrophoresis can affect its movement in gel. Increasing ethidium bromide intercalated into the DNA can change it from a negatively supercoiled molecule into a fully relaxed form, then to positively coiled superhelix at maximum intercalation. Agarose gel electrophoresis can be used to resolve circular DNA with different supercoiling topology.

===Gel concentration===

The concentration of the gel determines the pore size of the gel which affects the migration of DNA. The resolution of the DNA changes with the percentage concentration of the gel. Increasing the agarose concentration of a gel reduces the migration speed and improves separation of smaller DNA molecules, while lowering gel concentration permits large DNA molecules to be separated. For a standard agarose gel electrophoresis, 0.7% gel concentration gives good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments, while 2% gel concentration gives good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments. Up to 3% gel concentration can be used for separating very tiny fragments but a vertical polyacrylamide gel would be more appropriate for resolving small fragments. High concentrations gel, however, requires longer run times (sometimes days) and high percentage gels are often brittle and may not set evenly. High percentage agarose gels should be run with PFGE or FIGE. Low percentage gels (0.1−0.2%) are fragile and may break. 1% gels are common for many applications.

===Applied field===
At low voltages, the rate of migration of the DNA is proportional to the voltage applied, i.e. the higher the voltage, the faster the DNA moves. However, in increasing electric field strength, the mobility of high-molecular-weight DNA fragments increases differentially, and the effective range of separation decreases and resolution therefore is lower at high voltage. For optimal resolution of DNA greater than 2kb in size in standard gel electrophoresis, 5 to 8 V/cm is recommended. Voltage is also limited by the fact that it heats the gel and may cause the gel to melt if a gel is run at high voltage for a prolonged period, particularly for low-melting point agarose gel.

The mobility of DNA however may change in an unsteady field. In a field that is periodically reversed, the mobility of DNA of a particular size may drop significantly at a particular cycling frequency. This phenomenon can result in band inversion whereby larger DNA fragments move faster than smaller ones in PFGE.

==Mechanism of migration and separation==

The negative charge of its phosphate backbone moves the DNA towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis. However, the migration of DNA molecules in solution, in the absence of a gel matrix, is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis, i.e. there is no separation by size without a gel matrix. Hydrodynamic interaction between different parts of the DNA are cut off by streaming counterions moving in the opposite direction, so no mechanism exists to generate a dependence of velocity on length on a scale larger than screening length of about 10 nm. This makes it different from other processes such as sedimentation or diffusion where long-ranged hydrodynamic interaction are important.

The gel matrix is therefore responsible for the separation of DNA by size during electrophoresis, however the precise mechanism responsible the separation is not entirely clear. A number of models exists for the mechanism of separation of biomolecules in gel matrix, a widely accepted one is the Ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve consisting of randomly distributed network of inter-connected pores. A globular protein or a random coil DNA moves through the connected pores large enough to accommodate its passage, and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix, and the molecules of different sizes can therefore be separated in this process of sieving.

The Ogston model however breaks down for large molecules whereby the pores are significantly smaller than size of the molecule. For DNA molecules of size greater than 1 kb, a reptation model (or its variants) is most commonly used. This model assumes that the DNA can crawl in a &quot;snake-like&quot; fashion (hence &quot;reptation&quot;) through the pores as an elongated molecule. At higher electric field strength, this turned into a biased reptation model, whereby the leading end of the molecule become strongly biased in the forward direction, and this leading edge pulls the rest of the molecule along. In the fully biased mode, the mobility reached a saturation point and DNA beyond a certain size cannot be separated. Perfect parallel alignment of the chain with the field however is not observed in practice as that would mean the same mobility for long and short molecules. Further refinement of the biased reptation model takes into account of the internal fluctuations of the chain.

The biased reptation model has also been used to explain the mobility of DNA in PFGE. The orientation of the DNA is progressively built up by reptation after the onset of a field, and the time it reached the steady state velocity is dependent on the size of the molecule. When the field is changed, larger molecules take longer to reorientate, it is therefore possible to discriminate between the long chains that cannot reach its steady state velocity from the short ones that travel most of the time in steady velocity. Other models, however, also exist.

Real-time fluorescence microscopy of stained molecules showed more subtle dynamics during electrophoresis, with the DNA showing considerable elasticity as it alternately stretching in the direction of the applied field and then contracting into a ball, or becoming hooked into a U-shape when it gets caught on the polymer fibres. This observation may be termed the &quot;caterpillar&quot; model. Other model proposes that the DNA gets entangled with the polymer matrix, and the larger the molecule, the more likely it is to become entangled and its movement impeded.

==Visualization==
The most common dye used to make DNA or RNA bands visible for agarose gel electrophoresis is ethidium bromide, usually abbreviated as EtBr. It fluoresces under UV light when intercalated into the major groove of DNA (or RNA). By running DNA through an EtBr-treated gel and visualizing it with UV light, any band containing more than ~20 ng DNA becomes distinctly visible. EtBr is a known mutagen, and safer alternatives are available, such as GelRed, produced by Biotium, which binds to the minor groove.

SYBR Green I is another dsDNA stain, produced by Invitrogen. It is more expensive, but 25 times more sensitive, and possibly safer than EtBr, though there is no data addressing its mutagenicity or toxicity in humans.

SYBR Safe is a variant of SYBR Green that has been shown to have low enough levels of mutagenicity and toxicity to be deemed nonhazardous waste under U.S. Federal regulations. It has similar sensitivity levels to EtBr, but, like SYBR Green, is significantly more expensive. In countries where safe disposal of hazardous waste is mandatory, the costs of EtBr disposal can easily outstrip the initial price difference, however.

Since EtBr stained DNA is not visible in natural light, scientists mix DNA with negatively charged loading buffers before adding the mixture to the gel. Loading buffers are useful because they are visible in natural light (as opposed to UV light for EtBr stained DNA), and they co-sediment with DNA (meaning they move at the same speed as DNA of a certain length). Xylene cyanol and Bromophenol blue are common dyes found in loading buffers; they run about the same speed as DNA fragments that are 5000 bp and 300 bp in length respectively, but the precise position varies with percentage of the gel. Other less frequently used progress markers are Cresol Red and Orange G which run at about 125 bp and 50 bp, respectively.

Visualization can also be achieved by transferring DNA after SDS-PAGE to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by exposure to a hybridization probe. This process is termed Southern blotting.

For fluorescent dyes, after electrophoresis the gel is illuminated with an ultraviolet lamp (usually by placing it on a light box, while using protective gear to limit exposure to ultraviolet radiation). The illuminator apparatus mostly also contains imaging apparatus that takes an image of the gel, after illumination with UV radiation. The ethidium bromide fluoresces reddish-orange in the presence of DNA, since it has intercalated with the DNA. The DNA band can also be cut out of the gel, and can then be dissolved to retrieve the purified DNA.
The gel can then be photographed usually with a digital or polaroid camera. Although the stained nucleic acid fluoresces reddish-orange, images are usually shown in black and white (see figures). UV damage to the DNA sample can reduce the efficiency of subsequent manipulation of the sample, such as ligation and cloning. Shorter wavelength UV radiations (302 or 312 nm) cause greater damage, for example exposure for as little as 45 seconds can significantly reduce transformation efficiency. Therefore if the DNA is to be use for downstream procedures, exposure to a shorter wavelength UV radiations should be limited, instead higher-wavelength UV radiation (365 nm) which cause less damage should be used. Higher wavelength radiations however produces weaker fluorescence, therefore if it is necessary to capture the gel image, a shorter wavelength UV light can be used a short time. Addition of Cytidine or guanosine to the electrophoresis buffer at 1 mM concentration may protect the DNA from damage. Alternatively, a blue light excitation source with a blue-excitable stain such as SYBR Green or GelGreen may be used.

Gel electrophoresis research often takes advantage of software-based image analysis tools, such as ImageJ.

<doc id="238304" wikidata="Q316090" url="?curid=238304" title="Valerius Flaccus (poet)">
<text>Gaius Valerius Flaccus (; died ) was a 1st-century Roman poet who flourished during the &quot;Silver Age&quot; under the Flavian dynasty, and wrote a Latin &quot;Argonautica&quot; that owes a great deal to Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27; more famous epic.

==Life==
The only widely accepted mention of Valerius Flaccus by his contemporaries is by Quintilian (10.1.90), who laments the recent death of &quot;Valerius Flaccus&quot; as a great loss; as Quintilian&#x27;s work was finished about 90 AD, this traditionally gives a limit for the death of Valerius Flaccus. Recent scholarship, however, puts forward an alternative date of about 95 AD, and definitely before the death of Domitian in 96 AD.

It has been claimed that he was a member of the College of Fifteen, who had charge of the Sibylline books, based on a reference in his work to the presence of a tripod in a &quot;pure home&quot; (1.5). The assumption that this indicates he himself was a member, however, has also been contested.

A contested mention of a poet of the name &quot;Valerius Flaccus&quot; is by Martial (1.76), who refers to a native of Padua. A subscription in the Vatican manuscript adds the name &quot;Setinus Balbus&quot;, a name which suggests that its holder was a native of Setia in Latium, however it is not clear if this inscription refers to &quot;Valerius Flaccus&quot; or someone else. The connection of this &quot;Valerius Flaccus&quot; to Gaius Valerius Flaccus has been contested under the assumption that Martial was referring to his friend&#x27;s financial strife, and that Gaius Valerius Flaccus was a member of the College of Fifteen, and therefore likely to have been wealthy.

==&quot;Argonautica&quot;==
Valerius Flaccus&#x27; only surviving work, the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, was dedicated to Vespasian on his setting out for Britain. It was written during the siege, or shortly after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 AD. As the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD is alluded to, its composition must have occupied him a long time. The &quot;Argonautica&quot; is an epic poem probably intended to be in eight books (though intended totals of ten and twelve books, the latter corresponding to Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid,&quot; an important poetic model, have also been proposed) written in traditional dactylic hexameters, which recounts Jason&#x27;s quest for the Golden Fleece.

The Argonautica was lost until 1411, when the first 4½ volumes were found at St Gall in 1417 and published at Bologna in 1474.

The poem&#x27;s text, as it has survived, is in a very corrupt state; it ends so abruptly with the request of Medea to accompany Jason on his homeward voyage, that it is assumed by most modern scholars that it was never finished. It is a free imitation and in parts a translation of the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Apollonius of Rhodes, &quot;to whom he is superior in arrangement, vividness, and description of character&quot; (Loeb Classical Library). The familiar subject had already been treated in Latin verse in the popular version of Varro Atacinus. The object of the work has been described as the glorification of Vespasian&#x27;s achievements in securing Roman rule in Britain and opening up the ocean to navigation (as the Euxine was opened up by the &quot;Argo&quot;).

In 1911, the compilers of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; remarked, 
More modern analysis has been more accepting of Valerius Flaccus&#x27; style, noting how it fits in the &quot;long and energetic Roman tradition of appropriation of the golden age and iron age myths&quot; and commenting on his narrative technique:

<text>Masaniello (, ; an abbreviation of Tommaso Aniello; 29 June 1620 – 16 July 1647) was an Italian fisherman who became leader of the 1647 revolt against the rule of Habsburg Spain in the Kingdom of Naples.

==Name and place of birth==

Until recently it was believed that Masaniello was a native of Amalfi, when in fact he was born in Vico Rotto al Mercato, one of the many lanes around the market square in Naples. The source of this misunderstanding is that Amalfi was simply part of his name, but has been traditionally interpreted as a reference to his place of origin. Some sources do argue that Tommaso Aniello was born in Amalfi, where he was a friend of another unique character, Abbot Pirone, so named because he improperly used his habit to escape justice but who was, in reality, a bandit who would kill for a fee, and who would have been Tommaso&#x27;s collaborator during the Neapolitan uprising. In 1896, the poet Salvatore Di Giacomo resolved the confusion around Masaniello and Amalfi by transcribing the act of baptism found in the Church of Santa Caterina which cites:

&quot;On June 29, 1620 Tommaso Aniello son of Cicco d&#x27;Amalfi and Antonia Gargano was baptized by me Don Giovanni Matteo Peta, and lifted from the sacred font by Agostino Monaco and Giovanna de Lieto in Vico Rotto.&quot;
The celebration took place on the day of birth, and in the same church where in 1641 Tommaso Aniello would later marry the sixteen-year-old Bernardina Pisa. The historian Giuseppe Galasso suggested that the misunderstanding &quot;was fostered and encouraged by a conscious attitude of power and official culture in Spanish Naples. The faithful city [...] was not to be and could not admit the presence of an infidel, a rebel and one who had questioned the Spanish government in Naples.&quot; On 7 July 1997, at the 350th anniversary of the popular uprising, the City of Naples placed an inscription in honour of Masaniello in Vico Rotto al Mercato.

==From birth to 1647==
Masaniello&#x27;s family was humble but not poor. His father, Francesco (Cicco) d&#x27;Amalfi was a fisherman and shopkeeper. His mother, Antonia Gargano was a housekeeper who became pregnant with Masaniello before her marriage. He had two younger brothers and one sister: Giovanni, who was another leader of the rebellion; Francesco, who died in infancy; and Grazia. The house where he lived was in the Pendino quarter, where the tax on fish was collected, and close to Porta Nolana which dealt with the duty on flour. 
At the time, Naples had about 250,000 inhabitants, and was one of the most populous metropolises in Europe. Market Square, where Masaniello spent his whole life, was the nerve centre. It housed stalls selling all manner of goods, it was where acrobats performed for the common people and, in the days of Conrad of Swabia, had been the place for public executions. 
During the 1640s, Habsburg Spain was faced with a long series of disastrous conflicts: the revolt of the Netherlands (1568–1648), the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), the Revolt of Catalonia (1640–1659), and the secession of Portugal (1640–1668). To support the war effort, the Iberian Crown imposed a heavy tax burden on the Viceroy of Naples in order to restore the coffers of its vast empire, whose Golden Age was inevitably coming to an end.
Masaniello, a fisherman and fishmonger like his father, was described by his contemporaries as:

...a young man of twenty-seven, beautiful and graceful in appearance, his face was brown and somewhat burned by the sun: black eyes, blond hair, with locks that ran down his neck.
Often, to escape taxation, he brought the fish directly to the homes of nobles, but was almost always caught in the act by the tax collectors and imprisoned. His main activity was, however, smuggling, so much so that in 1646 his reputation as a skilled smuggler was already well-established in the Market. He worked mainly for the feudal nobility, including the Marchesa di Brienza and don Diomede Carafa, Duke of Maddaloni, who treated him almost like a slave. His wife Bernardina, arrested for bringing to town a sock full of flour, and evading duty, was imprisoned for eight days. To obtain her freedom, Masaniello was forced to pay a ransom of one hundred crowns, which brought him into debt. According to tradition, it was this episode that provoked in him a desire to avenge the people against their oppressors.
During a stay in prison, he met the &quot;Grand Admiral&quot; and Doctor of Law Marco Vitale, the illegitimate son of a famous lawyer, who brought him into contact with some members of the middle class tired of the continuing abuses of the tax collector and privileges of the nobility. Masaniello also became a pupil of the writer Don Giulio Genoino, an octogenarian priest with a past as a defender of the people.
In 1619, during the term of office of Viceroy Don Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna, Genoino had been called twice to represent the interests of the people against the nobility, essentially playing the role of an ancient tribune. In 1620, however, he had been dismissed by the Consiglio Collaterale and imprisoned far from Naples.
Returning to the city in 1639, he immediately began to fight for the rights of the people around him and formed a large group of agitators, including: Francesco Antonio Arpaja, his old and trusted employee, the Carmelite friar Savino Boccardo, the aforementioned Marco Vitale and the various captains of the city districts, and a great number of &quot;Lazzarini&quot;.

==The revolt==

Misgovernment and fiscal oppression during the Thirty Years&#x27; War aroused much discontent throughout the Kingdom of Naples. A revolt broke out at Palermo in May 1647, and the people of Naples followed the example of the Sicilians. The immediate occasion of the latter rising was a new tax on fruit and the other ordinary food of the poor, and the chief instigator of the movement was Masaniello, who took command of the malcontents. The outbreak began on 7 July 1647 with a riot at the city gates between the fruit vendors of the environs and the customs officers; the latter were forced to flee, and the customs office was burnt. The rioters then poured into Naples and forced their way into the palace of the viceroy, Rodrigo Ponce de León, the hated Duke of Arcos, who had to take refuge first in a neighbouring convent, then in Castel Sant&#x27;Elmo, and finally in Castel Nuovo.

Masaniello attempted to discipline the mob and restrain its destructive instincts, and to some extent he succeeded; attired in his fisherman&#x27;s garb, he gave audiences and administered justice from a wooden scaffolding outside his house. Several rioters, including the Duke of Maddaloni, an opponent of the viceroy, and his brother Giuseppe Caraffa, who had come to Naples to make trouble, were condemned to death by him and executed. The mob, which every day obtained more arms and was becoming more intractable, terrorized the city, drove off the troops summoned from outside, and elected Masaniello &quot;captain-general&quot;; the revolt was even spreading to the provinces. Genoino and Masaniello demanded parity between people and nobility on the city council and a new charter for Naples. Their purpose was not to tear down the state, but to work with the viceroy in order to dislodge aristocratic control.

Masaniello led a mob of nearly a thousand which ransacked the armouries and opened the prisons, leaving him in charge of the city. Eventually, the viceroy, whose negotiations with Masaniello had been frequently interrupted by fresh tumults, ended by granting all the concessions demanded. On 13 July 1647, through the mediation of Cardinal Ascanio Filomarino, archbishop of Naples, a convention was signed between the Duke of Arcos and Masaniello as &quot;leader of the most faithful people of Naples,&quot; by which the rebels were pardoned, the more oppressive taxes removed, and the citizens granted certain rights, including that of remaining in arms until the treaty should have been ratified by the King.

The astute Duke of Arcos then invited Masaniello to the palace, confirmed his title of &quot;captain-general of the Neapolitan people,&quot; gave him a gold chain of office, and offered him a pension. Masaniello refused the pension and laid down his dignities, saying that he wished to return to his old life as a fisherman; but he was entertained by the viceroy and, partly owing to the strain and excitement of the past days, partly because he was made dizzy by his astonishing change of fortune, or perhaps, as it was believed, because he was poisoned, he lost his head and behaved like a frenzied maniac.

The Viceroy gave way, but the nobles of Naples were resistant: there was an attempt to assassinate Masaniello, but then on 13 July, dressed in finery and a golden chair, he was confirmed Captain-General in a solemn ceremony in the cathedral.

Masaniello rapidly and uncannily echoed the irrational behaviour of his populist Roman predecessor, Cola di Rienzo, 300 years before. After escaping from house arrest on 16 July, Masaniello went to the Church of the Carmine where the Archbishop was celebrating mass for the Feast of Our Lady of Carmel. Blaspheming, Masaniello denounced his fellow citizens. He was again arrested and taken to a nearby monastery, where he was assassinated by a group of grain merchants. His head was cut off and brought by a band of roughs to the viceroy and the body was buried outside the city. But the next day the populace, angered by the alteration of the measures for weighing bread, repented of its insane fury; the body of Masaniello was dug up and given a splendid funeral, at which the viceroy himself was represented.

The Viceroy, desperately, tried to leave the city&#x27;s governance in the hands of Genoino, who proved unable to resist demands from the streets. Extremists took over. A second revolution took place in August, which culminated in Genoino&#x27;s exile and the proclamation of a Neapolitan Republic under French protection. The Spanish eventually recovered Naples in April 1648 .

==Masaniello in art and political theory ==
Masaniello was portrayed many times in Neapolitan pictures of the centuries following his death.
*The philosopher Baruch Spinoza reportedly sketched a portrait of Masaniello with a face very similar to his own; an apparent self-portrait of the philosopher as a fisherman in a shirt, with a net thrown over his shoulder, a pose made familiar by portraits of Masaniello.
*Masaniello was used in John Locke&#x27;s &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; of Robert Filmer&#x27;s position in the former&#x27;s &quot;First Treatise of Government&quot;. Taking Filmer to believe that might is right, Locke stated: &quot;had [Filmer] had the happiness to live under Massanello&#x27;s [sic] government, he could not by this his own rule have forborne to have done homage to him, with &quot;O king live for ever&quot;, since the manner of his government by supreme power, made him &quot;properly&quot; king, who was but the day before &quot;properly&quot; a fisherman.&quot;
*Masaniello&#x27;s revolt was condemned by several Neapolitan poets, including Antonio Muscettola, Antonio de Rossi, Vincenzo Zito, and the Jesuit Giacomo Lubrano (who included a regretful reference to the British treatment of Charles I).
*Advocating &quot;a government of our own&quot; in &quot;Common Sense&quot;, Thomas Paine evoked the spectre of a rabble-rouser like Masaniello: &quot;it is infinitely wiser and safer, to form a constitution of our own in a cool deliberate manner, while we have it in our power, than to trust such an interesting event to time and chance. If we omit it now, some Massanello may hereafter arise, who laying hold of popular disquietudes, may collect together the desperate and discontented, and by assuming to themselves the powers of government, may sweep away the liberties of the continent like a deluge.&quot;
*Masaniello&#x27;s insurrection appealed to the imagination of poets and composers, and formed the subject of several operas, including Reinhard Keiser&#x27;s &quot;Masaniello furioso&quot; (1706), Daniel Auber&#x27;s &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot; (1828), and Jacopo Napoli&#x27;s (1953) &quot;Mas&#x27; Aniello&quot;. Of these, &quot;La muette de Portici&quot; had Masaniello appearing on stage and calling the Neapolitan fishermen to arms had the effect of making the audience leave the hall and pour into the streets of Brussels to start the real-life Belgian Revolution of 1830. 
*Christian Weise, the political scientist and educator of the German political elite, portrayed Masaniello in a school drama that warned the German princes against abusing the prerogatives they had gained at the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War with the Peace of Westphalia

The 2019 biopic of Argentine footballer Diego Maradona produced by Asif Kapaddi shows an interview featuring Maradona in which the broadcaster Gianni Mina compares Maradona with Masaniello. Famously Maradona had asked the people of Naples to support his Argentine team in the semi-final of the World Cup 1990. Argentina went on to win. The interview occurs about 1h39minutes into the film.

<text>John Hunt Morgan (June 1, 1825September 4, 1864) was a Confederate general in the American Civil War. In April 1862, he raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, fought at Shiloh, and then launched a costly raid in Kentucky, which encouraged Braxton Bragg&#x27;s invasion of that state. He also attacked General William Rosecrans&#x27;s supply lines. In July 1863, he set out on a 1,000-mile raid into Indiana and Ohio, taking hundreds of prisoners. But after most of his men had been intercepted by U.S. Navy gunboats, including the USS Moose, Morgan surrendered at Salineville, Ohio, the northernmost point ever reached by uniformed Confederates. Morgan carried out the diversionary &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Raid&quot; against orders, which gained no tactical advantage for the Confederacy while losing the regiment. Morgan escaped prison, but his credibility was so low that he was restricted to minor operations. He was killed at Greeneville, Tennessee, in September 1864. Morgan was the brother-in-law of Confederate general A. P. Hill. Various schools and a memorial are dedicated to him.

==Early life and career==
John H. Morgan was born in Huntsville, Alabama, the eldest of ten children of Calvin and Henrietta (Hunt) Morgan. He was an uncle of geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan and a maternal grandson of John Wesley Hunt, an early founder of Lexington, Kentucky, and one of the first millionaires west of the Allegheny Mountains. He was also the brother-in-law of A. P. Hill and of Basil W. Duke. His first cousin, twice removed, Abijah Hunt, an important early merchant and slave trader in the Natchez District in Mississippi, was killed in a duel with Mississippi Governor George Poindexter in 1811. The man we know today as John Hunt Morgan never used his middle name of Hunt during the warit is a post-war appellation.

John Wesley Hunt, Morgan&#x27;s grandfather, was a leading landowner and businessman in Kentucky and was the first millionaire west of the Allegheny Mountains. &quot;His business empire included interest in banking, horse breeding, agriculture, and hemp manufacturing. Among his business associates were Henry Clay and John Jacob Astor.&quot;

Morgan&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Luther and Anna (Cameron) Morgan. Luther Morgan had settled in Huntsville, but a downturn in the cotton economy forced him to mortgage his holdings. His father, Calvin Morgan, lost his Huntsville home in 1831 when he could not pay the property taxes following the failure of his pharmacy. The family then moved to Lexington, where he would manage one of his father-in-law&#x27;s sprawling farms.

Morgan grew up on the farm outside of Lexington and attended Transylvania College for two years but was suspended in 1844 for dueling with a fraternity brother. In 1846, Morgan became a Freemason, at Daviess Lodge #22, Lexington, Kentucky. Morgan desired a military career, but the small size of the U.S. military severely limited opportunities for officer&#x27;s commissions.

In 1846, Morgan enlisted with his brother Calvin and uncle Alexander in the United States Army as a cavalry private during the Mexican–American War. He was elected second lieutenant and was promoted to first lieutenant before arriving in Mexico, where he saw combat in the Battle of Buena Vista. On his return to Kentucky, he became a hemp manufacturer, and in 1848, he married Rebecca Gratz Bruce, the 18-year-old sister of one of his business partners. Morgan also hired out and occasionally sold the people that he enslaved. After the death of John Wesley Hunt in 1849, his fortunes significantly improved as his mother, Henrietta, began financing his business ventures.

In 1853, Morgan&#x27;s wife delivered a stillborn son. She contracted septic thrombophlebitis, popularly known as &quot;milk leg&quot;, an infection of a blood clot in a vein, which eventually led to an amputation. They became increasingly emotionally distant from one another. Known as a gambler and philanderer, Morgan was also known for his generosity. It is rumored that he had one slave son, Sidney Morgan, by an enslaved woman and was the grandfather of African American inventor Garrett Morgan (1877–1963). No historical documents exist to prove that John Hunt Morgan was the father of Sidney Morgan, or the grandfather of Garrett Morgan. He was an enslaver and an investor in the Lexington slave-trading business of Lewis C. Robards. Further, Sidney A. Morgan was said to have been born in 1834, when Morgan was 9 years of age.

Morgan remained interested in the military. He raised a militia artillery company in 1852, but it was disbanded by the state legislature two years later. In 1857, with the rise of sectional tensions, Morgan raised an independent infantry company known as the &quot;Lexington Rifles&quot; and spent much of his free time drilling the company.

==American Civil War==

Like most Kentuckians, Morgan did not initially support declaring secession from the United States. Immediately after Lincoln&#x27;s election in November 1860, he wrote to his brother, Thomas Hunt Morgan, then a student at Kenyon College in northern Ohio, &quot;Our State will not I hope secede I have no doubt but Lincoln will make a good President, at least we ought to give him a fair trial &amp; then if he commits some overt act all the South will be a unit.&quot; By the following spring, Tom Morgan (who also had opposed Kentucky&#x27;s secession) transferred home to the Kentucky Military Institute and began to support the Confederacy. Just before the Fourth of July, by way of a steamer from Louisville, he quietly left for Camp Boone, just across the Tennessee border, to enlist in the Kentucky State Guard. John stayed home in Lexington to tend to his troubled business and ailing wife. Becky Morgan died on July 21, 1861.

In September, Morgan and his militia company went to Tennessee and joined the Confederate States Army. Morgan soon raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment and became its colonel on April 4, 1862.

Morgan and his regiment fought at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, and he soon became a symbol to secessionists, in their hopes of occupying Kentucky for the Confederacy. A Louisiana writer, Robert D. Patrick, compared Morgan to Francis Marion and wrote that &quot;a few thousands of such men as his would regain us Kentucky and Tennessee.&quot;
In his first Kentucky raid, Morgan left Knoxville on July 4, 1862, with almost 900 men and, in three weeks, swept through Kentucky, deep in the rear of Major General Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s army. He reported the capture of 1,200 U.S. soldiers, whom he paroled, acquired several hundred horses, and destroyed massive quantities of supplies. He unnerved Kentucky&#x27;s U.S. military government and President Abraham Lincoln received so many frantic appeals for help that he complained that &quot;they are having a stampede in Kentucky.&quot; Historian Kenneth W. Noe wrote that Morgan&#x27;s feat &quot;in many ways surpassed J. E. B. Stuart&#x27;s celebrated &#x27;Ride around McClellan&#x27; and the Army of the Potomac the previous spring.&quot; The success of Morgan&#x27;s raid was one of the key reasons that the Confederate Heartland Offensive of Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith was launched later that fall, assuming that tens of thousands of Kentuckians would enlist in the Confederate Army if they invaded the state.

As a colonel, the widow of Brigadier General Barnard Elliott Bee Jr. presented him with a Palmetto Armory pistol. The Museum of the American Civil War now owns that pistol.

Morgan was promoted to brigadier general (his highest rank) on December 11, 1862, though Jefferson Davis did not sign the Promotion Orders until December 14, 1862. He received the thanks of the Confederate Congress on May 1, 1863, for his raids on the supply lines of U.S. Army Major General William S. Rosecrans in December and January, most notably his victory at the Battle of Hartsville on December 7.

On December 14, 1862, Morgan married Martha &quot;Mattie&quot; Ready, the daughter of Tennessee United States Representative Charles Ready and a cousin of William T. Haskell, another former U.S. representative from Tennessee.

===Morgan&#x27;s Raid===


Hoping to divert U.S. troops and resources in conjunction with the twin Confederate operations of Vicksburg and Gettysburg in the summer of 1863, Morgan set off on a diversionary campaign that would become known as &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Raid&quot;. Morgan crossed the Ohio River and raided southern Indiana and Ohio. At Corydon, Indiana, the raiders met 450 local Home Guard in the Battle of Corydon, resulting in eleven Confederates and five Home Guard killed.

In July, at Versailles, Indiana, while Confederate soldiers raided nearby militia and looted county and city treasuries, the jewels of the local masonic lodge were stolen. When Morgan, a Freemason, learned of the theft, he recovered the jewels and returned them to the lodge the following day.

After several more skirmishes, during which Morgan captured and paroled thousands of U.S. soldiers, Morgan&#x27;s raid almost ended on July 19, 1863, at the Battle of Buffington Island in Ohio, when approximately 700 of his men were captured while trying to cross the Ohio River into West Virginia. Intercepted by U.S. Navy gunboats, over 300 of his men succeeded in crossing. Most of Morgan&#x27;s men captured that day spent the rest of the war in Camp Douglas, a prisoner-of-war camp in Chicago. On July 26, near Salineville, Ohio, Morgan and his depleted soldiers finally surrendered. It was the farthest northward that any uniformed Confederate troops would penetrate during the war.

On November 27, Morgan and six of his officers, most notably Thomas Hines, escaped from their cells in the Ohio Penitentiary by digging a tunnel from Hines&#x27; cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron. Shortly after midnight, Morgan and three of his officers boarded a train from the nearby Columbus train station and arrived in Cincinnati that morning. Morgan and Hines jumped from the train before reaching the depot and escaped into Kentucky by hiring a skiff to take them across the Ohio River. Through the assistance of insurgents, they eventually reached the Confederacy. Coincidentally, the same day Morgan escaped, his wife gave birth to a daughter, who died shortly afterward before Morgan returned.

Though Morgan&#x27;s Raid was breathlessly followed by the Northern and Southern U.S. press and caused the U.S. leadership considerable concern, it was little more than a showy but ultimately futile sidelight to the war. Furthermore, Morgan had disobeyed Braxton Bragg&#x27;s orders not to cross the river. Despite the raiders&#x27; best efforts, U.S. forces had amassed nearly 110,000 militia in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio; dozens of United States Navy gunboats along the Ohio; and strong U.S. cavalry forces, which doomed the raid from the beginning. The cost of the attack to the United States was extensive, with compensation claims still being filed against the U.S. government well into the early 20th century. However, the Confederacy&#x27;s loss of Morgan&#x27;s light cavalry outweighed the benefits.

===Late career and death===
After fleeing Ohio, Morgan returned to active duty. However, the men he was assigned were inexperienced compared to those he commanded previously. Morgan again began raiding into Kentucky. However, his men were undisciplined, and he was unwilling or unable to control them, leading to open pillaging along with high casualties. The raids of this season were in risky defiance of a strategic situation in the border states that had changed radically from the year before. U.S. Army defense of this region, long denied to major Confederate armies, had progressed so that even highly mobile raiders could no longer count on easily evading them. Public outrage at Morgan&#x27;s raid across the Ohio River may have contributed to this state of affairs.

Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Last Kentucky Raid&quot; was carried out in June 1864, including during the Battle of Cynthiana. After winning a minor victory on June 11 against an inferior infantry unit in the engagement known as the Battle of Keller&#x27;s Bridge on the Licking River, near Cynthiana, Kentucky, Morgan chanced another engagement the following day against superior U.S. Army mounted forces that were known to be approaching. The result was a disaster for the Confederates, resulting in the destruction of Morgan&#x27;s force as a cohesive unit, only a tiny fraction of whom escaped with their lives and liberty as fugitives, including Morgan and some of his officers.

Braxton Bragg never trusted Morgan again after the flashy but unauthorized 1863 Ohio raid. Nevertheless, on August 22, 1864, Morgan was placed in command of the Trans-Allegheny Department, embracing the Confederate forces in eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia at the time. Yet around this time, some Confederate authorities were quietly investigating Morgan for charges of criminal banditry, likely leading to his removal from command. He began to organize a raid aimed at Knoxville, Tennessee.

John Hunt Morgan arrived in Greeneville, Tennessee on the afternoon of Saturday, September 3, 1864. That evening a 12-year-old boy, who lived west of town, rode the to a U.S. cavalry encampment at Bulls Gap to report that secessionist soldiers were in his town again. Confederate scouts had spotted the U.S. forces, but Morgan believed the bulk of the force were some at Strawberry Plains. For their part, the &quot;Tennessee Yankees,&quot; led by Alvan C. Gillem, had inaccurate intelligence from the boy that Hunt was with maybe 300 men when, in fact, he had 1,500 soldiers and two cannons. Gillem and his colonels, John K. Miller, W. H. Ingerton, and John &quot;Belt&quot; Brownlow, determined they must seize the moment and organized what was intended to be an encirclement of the town, dividing their forces in two, with Ingerton&#x27;s locally raised soldiers taking &quot;a trail used by wood haulers,&quot; and the bulk of the force under Gillem and Brownlow taking the main road. The night ride was beset by thunderstorms, which conferred two meager advantages: Confederate scouts stayed inside, and &quot;almost constant lightning&quot; lit their way down the muddy, mostly empty, country roads.
Near morning, three civilians informed the advancing U.S. troops that they were facing a considerably larger Confederate force than they understood and that John Hunt Morgan had spent the night at the Williams mansion, where he dined with the ladies and the servants. The Williams family had three sons, one a U.S. Army officer and two Confederate Army officers; thus, the family hosted officers of both armies during the war. Hunt had placed pickets on three roads entering the town—but not Newport Road, the one that Col. Ingerton and his men would take—and perhaps most importantly, &quot;by placing his units a few miles outside Greeneville, Morgan rested for the night out of direct contact with his troops.&quot; As Col. Ingerton approached the town, &quot;an excited young black man&quot; was one of the three civilians who described Morgan&#x27;s whereabouts to U.S. soldiers. This was likely the first that Ingerton heard about Morgan specifically being in the area, but Ingerton took the man at his word and &quot;called upon Capt. Christopher C. Wilcox of Company G, ordering him to take his company and Northington&#x27;s Company I and &#x27;dash into town, surround the Williams&#x27; residence, and bring Morgan out dead or alive.&#x27;&quot;
The two companies under the command of Capt. Wilcox rode into town, rousted what rebel sentries were to be found, and engaged in just enough gunfire with Confederates along Main Street to awaken Morgan. As U.S. soldiers entered the Williams property, they spotted &quot;a man clad in a white shirt and trousers near the summer house. As they raced toward him, Morgan fired his pistols at them and dashed into the vineyard bordering Depot Street.&quot; Morgan fled through the grape arbor toward a hotel until Pvt. Andrew Campbell caught up with his group of three. Of two officers with Morgan in the shrubbery, one surrendered, and one &quot;caught a loose horse&quot; and escaped. Despite Campbell&#x27;s repeated demands that he halt, Morgan failed to comply and kept running. Pvt. Campbell shot Morgan through the back, foiling his getaway. The bullet traveled through his heart, and he died on the spot. Only later did any of the U.S. soldiers learn who Campbell had killed when Morgan&#x27;s body was identified by one of his staff officers, apparently in quite sentimental language: &quot;You have killed the best man in the Southern Confederacy...It is General Morgan.&quot;

Morgan was buried in Lexington Cemetery. The burial was shortly before the birth of his second child, another daughter.

==Legacy==

Hart County High School, in Munfordville, Kentucky, the site of the Battle for the Bridge, nicknamed their athletic teams the Raiders, in memory of Morgan&#x27;s men. Also, a large mural in the town depicts Morgan. Trimble County High School, in Bedford, Kentucky, also nicknamed their athletic teams the Raiders in memory of Morgan&#x27;s men.

A John Hunt Morgan Memorial statue in Lexington memorializes him. The statue was relocated from the courthouse lawn in July 2018, where slave auctions were held. It was subsequently relegated to the Confederate section of the Lexington Cemetery.

The Hunt-Morgan House, once his home, is a contributing property in a historic district in Lexington.

The John Hunt Morgan Bridge on East Main Street/U.S. Route 11 in Abingdon, Virginia, is named after him.

The John Hunt Morgan Bridge on South Main Street/U.S. Route 27 in Cynthiana, Kentucky, is named after him.

The General Morgan Inn, located at the spot he was killed in Greeneville, Tennessee, is named after him.

A Kentucky Army National Guard Field Artillery battalion, the 1st BN 623d FA (HIMARS) with headquarters in Glasgow, Kentucky, are known as Morgan&#x27;s Men.

A statue was erected in Pomeroy, Ohio, for his effect on the town and its people.

<text>Alfred von Reumont (15 August 1808 – 27 April 1887) was a German scholar and diplomatist.

==Biography==
He was the son of Gerhard Reumont (1765-1829), and named Alfred after the English king Alfred the Great. Educated at the universities of Bonn and Heidelberg, he obtained a position in Florence through the influence of an Englishman, William Craufurd, but soon he entered the Prussian diplomatic service and was employed in Florence, in Constantinople and in Rome. He also spent some time in the Foreign Office in Berlin. From 1851 to 1860 he represented his country in Florence. Reumont was the friend and adviser of Frederick William IV. In 1879 he founded the Aachener Geschichtsverein, and having spent his concluding years at Bonn and at Aix-la-Chapelle, he died in the latter city on 27 April 1887.

==Works==

Reumont&#x27;s numerous writings deal mainly with Italy, in which country he passed many years of his life. On the history of Florence and of Tuscany he wrote &quot;Tavole cronologiche e sincrone della storia fiorentina&quot; (1841; &quot;Supplement&quot;, 1875); &quot;Geschichte Toscanas seit dem Ende des florentinischen Freistaats&quot; (History of Toscany since the end of the Florentine freestate, Gotha, 1876–77); and a work on Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (Leipzig, 1874, and again 1883). This last book has been translated into English by R Harrison (1876). He remembered his connection with Florence when he wrote &quot;Römische Briefe von einem Florentiner&quot; (Roman letters from a Florentine, Leipzig, 1840–44), and his residence in Rome was also responsible for his &quot;Geschichte der Stadt Rom&quot; (3 vols., 1867–70).

Turning his attention to the history of Naples, he wrote &quot;Die Carafa von Maddaloni Neapel unter spanischer Herrschaft&quot; (1851; Eng. trans., 1854), and more general works on Italian history are: &quot;Beiträge zur italienischen Geschichte&quot; (6 vols., Berlin, 1853–57), and &quot;Charakterbilder aus der neueren Geschichte Italiens&quot; (1886).

More strictly biographical in their nature are: &quot;Die Jugend Caterinas de&#x27; Medici&quot; (Youth of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, 1854), which has been translated into French by A. Baschet (1866); &quot;Die Gräfin von Albany&quot; (1860) and a life of his close friend Capponi, &quot;Gino Capponi, ein Zeit- und Lebensbild&quot; (Life and Times of Gino Capponi, Gotha, 1880). His &quot;Ganganelli: Papst Clemens XIV., seine Briefe und seine Zeit&quot; (Ganganelli: Pope Clement XIV, his letters and times, Berlin, 1847) is valuable for the relations between this pope and the Jesuits.

Other works which may be mentioned are &quot;Zeitgenossen, Biografien und Charakteristichen&quot; (Berlin, 1862); &quot;Bibliografia dei lavori pubblicati in Germania sulla storia d&#x27;Italia&quot; (Berlin, 1863); &quot;Biographische Denkblätter nach personlichen Erinnerungen&quot; (Biographical memorials from personal memories, Leipzig, 1878); and &quot;Saggi di storia e letteratura&quot; (Florence, 1880). Reumont&#x27;s other important work, one which he was peculiarly fitted to write, was his &quot;Aus Friedrich Wilhelms IV. gesunden und kranken Tagen&quot; (From Frederick William IV&#x27;s healthy and sick days, Leipzig, 1885).

<doc id="238316" wikidata="Q104585676" url="?curid=238316" title="Richard III Society">
<text>The Richard III Society is a Ricardian society dedicated to the re-assessement of the reputation of King Richard III, the last Plantagenet King of England and the last English King to be killed in battle, and whose reputation was widely maligned in the centuries since his death, in large part due to Tudor propaganda.

In 2012, the society gain worldwide attraction due to its role in the finding of King Richard&#x27;s remains.

==History==
The society was founded in 1924 by Liverpool surgeon Samuel Saxon Barton (1892-1957) as The Fellowship of the White Boar, Richard&#x27;s badge and a symbol of the Yorkist army in the Wars of the Roses. Its membership was originally a small group of interested amateur historians whose aim was to bring about a re-assessment of the reputation of Richard III.

The society became moribund during the Second World War. In 1951, Josephine Tey published her detective novel &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot;, in which Richard&#x27;s guilt is examined and doubted. In 1955, Laurence Olivier released his film of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, which at the beginning admitted that the play was based on legend, and a sympathetic, detailed biography of Richard was published by Paul Murray Kendall, all of which went some way towards re-invigorating the society.

The Fellowship of the White Boar was renamed The Richard III Society in 1959.

In 1980, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, became the society&#x27;s Patron. Richard III was Duke of Gloucester before ascending the throne, therefore he was before his accession (Prince) Richard, Duke of Gloucester.

In 1986, the society established the Richard III and Yorkist History Trust, a registered charity, to advance research and publication related to the history of late medieval England.

The society publishes a scholarly journal, The Ricardian.

==Rediscovery of Richard III&#x27;s remains==
In 2012, the society, working in partnership with the University of Leicester and Leicester City Council, exhumed a skeleton at the site of the former Greyfriars Church that was later confirmed to be that of the King.

Philippa Langley, the secretary of the Scottish Branch of the Richard III Society, inaugurated the quest for King Richard&#x27;s lost grave as part of her ongoing research into the controversial monarch. Her project marked the first-ever search for the grave of an anointed King of England, and in 2013 was made into an acclaimed TV documentary &quot;Richard III: King In A Car Park&quot; by Darlow Smithson Productions for Channel 4.

Langley and Ricardian historian John Ashdown-Hill were awarded the MBE in recognition of their services to &quot;the Exhumation and Identification of Richard III&quot; (&quot;London Gazette&quot;) in the 2015 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

In 2022 the story of Philippa Langley and the rediscovery of Richard III’s remains were made into the feature film &quot;The Lost King&quot; directed by Stephen Frears.

<text>Daniel Morgan (c. 1736 – July 6, 1802) was an American pioneer, soldier, and politician from Virginia. One of the most respected battlefield tacticians of the American Revolutionary War of 1775–1783, he later commanded troops during the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion of 1791–1794.

Born in New Jersey to James and Eleanor Morgan, a Welsh family, Morgan settled in Winchester, Virginia. He became an officer of the Virginia militia and recruited a company of riflemen at the start of the Revolutionary War. Early in the war, Morgan served in Benedict Arnold&#x27;s expedition to Quebec and in the Saratoga campaign. He also served in the Philadelphia campaign before resigning from the army in 1779.

Morgan returned to the army after the Battle of Camden, and led the Continental Army to victory in the Battle of Cowpens. After the war, Morgan retired from the army again and developed a large estate. He was recalled to duty in 1794 to help suppress the Whiskey Rebellion, and commanded a portion of the army that remained in Western Pennsylvania after the rebellion. A member of the Federalist Party, Morgan twice ran for the United States House of Representatives, winning election to the House in 1796. He retired from Congress in 1799 and died in 1802.

==Early years==
Daniel Morgan is believed to have been born in the community of New Hampton in Lebanon Township, New Jersey. All four of his grandparents were Welsh immigrants who lived in Pennsylvania. Morgan&#x27;s parents were born in Pennsylvania and then later moved to New Jersey together. Morgan was the fifth of seven children of James Morgan (1702–1782) and Eleanor Lloyd (1706–1748). When Morgan was 17, he left home following a fight with his father. After working at odd jobs in Pennsylvania, he moved to the Shenandoah Valley. He finally settled on the Virginia frontier, near what is now Winchester, Virginia.

He worked clearing land, running a sawmill, and as a teamster. In a little more than two years, he saved enough to buy his own team. With multiple extra wagons, this operation quickly expanded into a thriving business. Morgan served as a civilian teamster during the French and Indian War with Daniel Boone, sometimes said to be his cousin. During the retreat from Fort Duquesne (Pittsburgh), he was punished with 500 lashes (a usually fatal sentence) for attacking an officer. Morgan thus acquired a disdain for British authorities and their treatment of provincials. Later, when he led troops, he banned flogging.

He continued as a wagoner, which much of the profits initially being spent on alcohol, gambling, and female company, and resulted in several appearances before a Virginia magistrate, for charges from assault, through the burning down of a neighbours tobacco shed, to horse theft. Though he earned enough to purchase a house, between Winchester and Battletown, with 225 acres of land, and ten slaves, by 1774. He would meet Abigail Curry, who would teach him to read and write, and by who he would have two daughters, Nancy and Betsy, and later marry.

Morgan later served as a rifleman in the provincial forces assigned to protect the western settlements from French-backed Indian raids. He led a force that relieved Fort Edwards during its siege and successfully directed the defence afterward. He served in Dunmore&#x27;s War, taking part in raids on Shawnee villages in the Ohio Country.

==American Revolution==
After the American Revolutionary War began at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the Continental Congress created the Continental Army in June 1775. They called for the formation of 10 rifle companies from the middle colonies to support the Siege of Boston, and late in June 1775, Virginia agreed to send two. Morgan was chosen by a unanimous vote by the Committee of Frederick County to form one of these companies and become its commander.

Morgan recruited 96 men in 10 days and assembled them at Winchester on July 14. This was even larger than authorized strength. His company of marksmen was nicknamed &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen&quot;. Another company was raised from Shepherdstown by his rival, Hugh Stephenson. Stephenson&#x27;s company initially planned to meet Morgan&#x27;s company in Winchester but found them gone. Morgan marched his men to Boston, Massachusetts in 21 days, arriving on August 6, 1775. Locals called it the &quot;Bee-Line March&quot;, noting that Stephenson somehow marched his men 600 miles from their meeting point at Morgan&#x27;s Spring, in 24 days, so they arrived at Cambridge on Friday, August 11, 1775. The long rifles used were more accurate and had a longer range than other firearms at that time – as compared to for standard smooth-bore muskets – but took much longer to load. As they were handmade, calibres varied, requiring differently sized bullets. When his men were done training Morgan used them as snipers, shooting mostly British officers who thought they were out of range; sometimes they killed 10 British in a day. This caused great outrage within and without the British army; amongst others, Washington disapproved of this way of war, and when gunpowder began to run out he forbade Morgan to fight in such a manner.

===Invasion of Canada===
In June that year, the Continental Congress authorized an invasion of Canada. Colonel Benedict Arnold convinced General Washington to start an eastern offensive in support of Montgomery&#x27;s invasion. Washington agreed to dispatch three companies from his forces at Boston, provided they agreed. Every company at Boston volunteered, and a lottery was used to choose who should go. Morgan&#x27;s company was one of them. Benedict Arnold selected Captain Morgan to lead the three companies as a battalion. Arnold&#x27;s expedition set out from Fort Western on September 25, with Morgan leading the advance party.

The Arnold Expedition started with about 1,050 men; by the time they reached Quebec on November 9, that had been reduced to 675. When Montgomery&#x27;s men arrived, they launched a joint assault. The Battle of Quebec began in a blizzard on the morning of December 31. The Patriots attacked in two pincers, commanded by Montgomery and Arnold.

Arnold attacked against the lower city from the north, but he suffered a leg wound early in the battle. Morgan took command of the force, and he successfully overcame the first rampart and entered the city. Montgomery&#x27;s force initiated their attack as the blizzard became severe, and Montgomery and many of his troops, except for Aaron Burr, were killed or wounded in the first British volley. With Montgomery down, his attack faltered. British General Carleton consequently was able to lead hundreds of the Quebec militia in the encirclement of the second attack. Carleton was also able to move his cannons and men to the first barricade, behind Morgan&#x27;s force. Divided and subject to fire from all sides, Morgan&#x27;s troops gradually surrendered. Morgan handed his sword to a French-Canadian priest, refusing to give it to Carleton in formal surrender. Morgan thus became one of the 372 men captured, and he remained a prisoner of war until he was exchanged in January 1777.

===11th Virginia Regiment and Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen===
When he rejoined Washington early in 1777, Morgan was surprised to learn he had been promoted to colonel for his bravery at Quebec. He was ordered to raise and command a new infantry regiment, the 11th Virginia Regiment of the Continental Line.

On June 13, 1777, Washington also gave Morgan command of the Provisional Rifle Corps, a light infantry force of 500 riflemen chosen from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia regiments of the Continental Army. Morgan simultaneously led the 11th Virginia Regiment, his permanent unit, and this provisional unit.

Washington wrote the following letter to Morgan on August 16, 1777: &quot;Sir: After you receive this, you will march, as soon as possible, with the corps under your command, to Peekskill, taking with you all the baggage belonging to it. When you arrive there, you will take directions from General Putnam, who, I expect, will have vessels provided to carry you to Albany. The approach of the enemy in that quarter has made a further reinforcement necessary, and I know of no corps so likely to check their progress, in proportion to its number, as that under your command. I have great dependence on you, your officers and men, and I am persuaded you will do honor to yourselves, and essential service to your country... I am, sir, your most obedient servant George Washington.&quot;

Many were from his own 11th Regiment, including his friend Captain Gabriel Long, and Long&#x27;s best snipers, including Corporals John Gassaway, Duncan MacDonald and Private Peter Carland. After their victory at Saratoga, Washington sent them to harass General William Howe&#x27;s rearguard, and Morgan did so during their entire withdrawal across New Jersey.

===Saratoga===

A detachment of Morgan&#x27;s regiment, commanded by Morgan, was reassigned to the army&#x27;s Northern Department and on Aug 30 he joined General Horatio Gates to aid in resisting Burgoyne&#x27;s offensive. He is prominently depicted in the painting of the &quot;Surrender of General Burgoyne&quot; at Saratoga by John Trumbull.

====Freeman&#x27;s Farm====
Morgan led his regiment, with the added support of Henry Dearborn&#x27;s 300-man New Hampshire infantry, as the advance to the main forces. On September 19, at Freeman&#x27;s Farm, they ran into the advance of General Simon Fraser&#x27;s wing of Burgoyne&#x27;s force. Every officer in the British advance party died in the first exchange, and the advance guard retreated.

Morgan&#x27;s men charged without orders, but the charge fell apart when they ran into the main column led by General Hamilton. Benedict Arnold arrived, and he and Morgan managed to reform the unit. As the British began to form on the fields at Freeman&#x27;s farm, Morgan&#x27;s men continued to break these formations with accurate rifle fire from the woods on the far side of the field. They were joined by another seven regiments from Bemis Heights.

For the rest of the afternoon, American fire held the British in check, but repeated American charges were repelled by British bayonets.

====Bemis Heights====

Burgoyne&#x27;s next offensive resulted in the Battle of Bemis Heights on Oct. 7. Morgan was assigned command of the left (or western) flank of the American position. The British plan was to turn that flank, using an advance by 1,500 men. This brought Morgan&#x27;s brigade once again up against General Fraser&#x27;s forces. Daniel Morgan&#x27;s sharpshooters were ordered to specifically shoot British officers and their Native American Guides. In order to cause maximum confusion and disorder among British Troops.

Passing through the Canadian loyalists, Morgan&#x27;s Virginia sharpshooters got the British light infantry trapped in a crossfire between themselves and Dearborn&#x27;s regiment. Although the light infantry broke, General Fraser was trying to rally them, encouraging his men to hold their positions when Benedict Arnold arrived. Arnold spotted him and called to Morgan: &quot;That man on the grey horse is a host unto himself and must be disposed of — direct the attention of some of the sharpshooters amongst your riflemen to him!&quot; Morgan reluctantly ordered Fraser shot by a sniper, and Timothy Murphy obliged him.

With Fraser mortally wounded, the British light infantry fell back into and through the redoubts occupied by Burgoyne&#x27;s main force. Morgan was one of those who then followed Arnold&#x27;s lead to turn a counter-attack from the British middle. Burgoyne retired to his starting positions, but about 500 men poorer for the effort. That night, he withdrew to the village of Saratoga, New York (renamed Schuylerville in honor of Philip Schuyler) about eight miles to the northwest.

During the next week, as Burgoyne dug in, Morgan and his men moved to his north. Their ability to cut up any patrols sent in their direction convinced the British that retreat was not possible.

===New Jersey and retirement===
After Saratoga, Morgan&#x27;s unit rejoined Washington&#x27;s main army, near Philadelphia. Throughout 1778 he hit British columns and supply lines in New Jersey but was not involved in any major battles. He was not involved in the Battle of Monmouth but actively pursued the withdrawing British forces and captured many prisoners and supplies. When the Virginia Line was reorganized on September 14, 1778, Morgan became the colonel of the 7th Virginia Regiment.

Throughout this period, Morgan became increasingly dissatisfied with the army and the Congress. He had never been politically active or cultivated a relationship with the Congress. As a result, he was repeatedly passed over for promotion to brigadier, favor going to men with less combat experience but better political connections. While still a colonel with Washington, he had temporarily commanded Weedon&#x27;s brigade and felt himself ready for the position. Besides this frustration, his legs and back aggravated him from the abuse taken during the Quebec Expedition. He was finally allowed to resign on June 30, 1779, and returned home to Winchester.

Being ordered by General George Washington, in the summer and fall of 1779, Morgan and his riflemen were part of Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition into the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions of New York.

In June 1780, he was urged to re-enter the service by General Gates but declined. Gates was taking command in the Southern Department, and Morgan felt that being outranked by so many militia officers would limit his usefulness. After Gates&#x27; disaster at the Battle of Camden, Morgan thrust all other considerations aside, and went to join the Southern command at Hillsborough, North Carolina.

===Southern Campaign===
He met Gates at Hillsborough, and was given command of the light infantry corps on Oct. 2. At last, on October 13, 1780, Morgan received his promotion to brigadier general.

Morgan met his new Department Commander, Nathanael Greene, on December 3, 1780, at Charlotte, North Carolina. Greene did not change his command assignment, but did give him new orders. Greene had decided to split his army and annoy the enemy in order to buy time to rebuild his force. He gave Morgan&#x27;s command of about 600 men the job of foraging and enemy harassment in the backcountry of South Carolina, while avoiding direct battle.

When this strategy became apparent, the British General Cornwallis sent Colonel Banastre Tarleton&#x27;s British Legion to track him down. Morgan talked with militia who had fought Tarleton. Morgan decided to disobey orders and provoke a battle.

====Battle of Cowpens====
Morgan chose to make his stand at Cowpens, South Carolina. On the morning of January 17, 1781, they met Tarleton in the Battle of Cowpens. Morgan had been joined by militia forces under Andrew Pickens and William Washington&#x27;s dragoons. Tarleton&#x27;s legion was supplemented with the light infantry from several regiments of regulars.

Morgan&#x27;s plan took advantage of Tarleton&#x27;s tendency for quick action and his disdain for the militia, as well as the longer range and accuracy of his Virginia riflemen. The marksmen were positioned to the front, followed by the militia, with the regulars at the hilltop. The first two units were to withdraw as soon as they were seriously threatened, but after inflicting damage. This would invite a premature charge from the British.

The tactic resulted in a double envelopment. As the British forces approached, the Americans, with their backs turned to the British, reloaded their muskets. When the British got close to the Americans, they turned and fired at point-blank range. In less than an hour, Tarleton&#x27;s 1,076 men suffered 110 killed and 830 captured; 200 British prisoners of war were wounded. The British Legion, among the best units in Cornwallis&#x27;s army, was effectively useless. The captured commander of a battalion of the 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser&#x27;s Highlanders, Archibald McArthur, said after the battle that, &quot;He was an officer before Tarleton was born; that the best troops in the service were put under &#x27;that boy&#x27; to be sacrificed&quot;.

Cornwallis had lost not only Tarleton&#x27;s legion but also his light infantry, losses that limited his speed of reaction for the rest of the campaign. For his actions, Virginia gave Morgan land and an estate that had been abandoned by a Tory. The damp and chill of the campaign had aggravated his sciatica to the point that he was in constant pain; on February 10, he returned to his Virginia farm. In July 1781, Morgan briefly joined Lafayette to pursue Banastre Tarleton once more, this time in Virginia, but they were unsuccessful.

==Later life==

Morgan resigned his commission after serving six-and-a-half years, and at 46 returned home to Frederick County. He was admitted as an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Virginia. He turned his attention to investing in land rather than clearing it, and eventually built an estate of more than . As part of his settling down in 1782, he joined the Presbyterian Church and, using Hessian prisoners of war, built a new house near Winchester, Virginia. He named the home Saratoga after his victory in New York. The Congress awarded him a gold medal in 1790 to commemorate his victory at Cowpens.

In 1794, he was briefly recalled to national service to help suppress the Whiskey Rebellion, and the same year, he was promoted to major general. Serving under General &quot;Light-Horse Harry&quot; Lee, Morgan led one wing of the militia army into Western Pennsylvania. The massive show of force brought an end to the protests without a shot being fired. After the uprising had been suppressed, Morgan commanded the remnant of the army that remained until 1795 in Pennsylvania, some 1,200 militiamen, one of whom was Meriwether Lewis.

Morgan ran for election to the US House of Representatives twice as a Federalist. He lost in 1794, but won in 1796 with 70% of the vote by defeating Democratic-Republican Robert Rutherford. Morgan served a single term from 1797 to 1799.

He died at his daughter&#x27;s home in Winchester on July 6, 1802. He was buried in Old Stone Presbyterian Church graveyard. The body was moved to the Mount Hebron Cemetery in Winchester, Virginia, after the American Civil War. His wife, Abigail, died in 1816 and was buried in Logan County, Kentucky.

==Legacy==
Daniel Morgan Parkinson, militia officer, official and entrepreneur of frontier Wisconsin, was the son of Morgan&#x27;s sister Mary, and was named after his famous uncle. Confederate General John Hunt Morgan claimed to be one of his descendants.

In 1820 Virginia named a new county—Morgan County—in his honor. (It is now in West Virginia.) The states of Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee followed their example. The North Carolina city of Morganton is also named after Morgan, as well as the Kentucky city of Morganfield (originally Morgan&#x27;s Field) which was founded in 1811 on land which was part of a Revolutionary War land grant to Daniel Morgan. Morgan actually never saw the land, but his daughter&#x27;s cousin-in-law, Presley O&#x27;Bannon, the &quot;Hero of Derna&quot; in the Barbary War, acquired the land, drew up a plan for the town and donated the land for the streets and public square.

In 1881 (on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Cowpens), a statue of Morgan was placed in the central town square of Spartanburg, South Carolina. It is located in Morgan Square and remains in place today.

In late 1951, an attempt was made to reinter Morgan&#x27;s body in Cowpens, South Carolina, but the Frederick-Winchester Historical Society blocked the move by securing an injunction in circuit court. The event was pictured by a staged photo that appeared in &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

In 1973, the home Saratoga was declared a National Historic Landmark.

Fort Morgan is a historic masonry pentagonal bastion fort at the mouth of Mobile Bay, Alabama, United States.

Morgan and his actions served as one of the key sources for the fictional character of Benjamin Martin in &quot;The Patriot&quot;, a motion picture released in 2000.

There is a street named after him in Lebanon Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.

A statue of Morgan was erected at the McConnelsville library, in Morgan County, Ohio in 2017.

In Winchester, Virginia, a middle school is named in his honor.

The Daniel Morgan House at Winchester was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

In the early 1780s, Morgan joined efforts with Col. Nathaniel Burwell to build a water-powered mill in Millwood, Virginia. The Burwell-Morgan Mill is open as a museum and is one of the oldest, most original operational grist mills in the country.

A statue of Morgan is on the west face of the Saratoga Monument in Schuylerville, New York.

<text>Marquis Gino Capponi (Florence, 13 September 1792 – Florence, 3 February 1876) was an Italian and historian of a Liberal Catholic bent.

==Biography==
The Capponi was an illustrious Florentine aristocratic family, and is mentioned as early as 1250; it acquired great wealth as a mercantile and banking firm, and many of its members distinguished themselves in the service of the republic and the Medicis (see Piero Capponi), and later in that of the house of Lorraine.

Gino was the son of the Marquis Pier Roberto Capponi, a nobleman greatly attached to the reigning grand duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand III and also the son of , foundress of the Passionist Sister. When that prince was deposed by the French in 1799 the Capponi family followed him into exile at Vienna, where they remained until he exchanged his rights to the grand duchy for a German principality (1803). The Capponi then returned to Florence, and in 1811 Gino married the marchesina Giulia Vernaccia. Although the family were very anti-French, Gino was chosen with other notables to pay homage to Napoleon in Paris in 1813. On the fall of Napoleon, Ferdinand returned to Tuscany (September 1814), but the restoration proved less reactionary there than in any other part of Italy.

Young Capponi was well received at court, but not satisfied with the life of a mere man of fashion, he devoted himself to serious study and foreign travel. After sundry journeys in Italy he again visited Paris in 1818, and then went to England. He became deeply interested in English institutions, and carefully studied the constitution, the electoral system, university life, and industrial organization. At Edinburgh he met Francis Jeffrey, the editor of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, and conceived a desire to found a similar review in Italy. Besides knowing Jeffrey he made the acquaintance of many prominent statesmen and men of letters, including Lord John Russell, the duke of Bedford, Dugald Stewart, and Ugo Foscolo. This visit had a great effect in forming his character, and while it made him an ardent Anglophile, he realized more and more the distressing conditions of his own country.

He returned to Italy in 1820, and on reaching Florence he helped found a review journal on the lines of the Edinburgh Review, which should attract the best literary talent. This he achieved with the help of the Swiss Giovan Pietro Vieusseux, and the result was the journal, &quot;Antologia&quot;. He contributed largely to its columns, as well as to those of the &quot;Archivio Storico&quot;, another of Vieusseux&#x27;s ventures. Capponi began to take a more active interest in politics, and entered into communication with the Liberals of all parts of Italy. He had discussed the possibility of liberating Italy with Prince Charles Albert of Savoy-Carignano, to whom he had introduced the Milanese revolutionist Count Confalonieri. But the collapse of the rising of 1821 and the imprisonment of Confalonieri made Capponi despair of achieving anything by revolution, and he devoted himself to the economic development of Tuscany and to study. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1842.

At his beautiful villa of Varramista he collected materials for a history of the Church; his work was interrupted by family troubles and by progressive vision loss. By 1844 he had become blind, although he continued to work by means of amanuenses. In 1847 he again plunged into politics and discussed plans for an Italian alliance against Austria. When the grand duke Leopold II decided in 1848 to grant his people a constitution, Capponi was made a member of the commission to draw it up, and he eventually became prime minister. During his short tenure of office he conducted foreign affairs with great skill, and made every effort to save the Italian situation after the defeat of Charles Albert on the Mincio. In October 1848 he resigned; soon afterwards the grand duke fled, creating disordered government in Florence. In 1849 the Grand Duke was able to return with an escort of Austrian soldiery. The blind statesman thanked God that he could not see the hated white Austrian uniforms in Florence.

He returned to his studies and commenced his great &quot;Storia della Repubblica di Firenze&quot;; but he followed political affairs with great interest, and helped to convince Lord John Russell, who stayed with him in 1859, of the hopelessness of the grand duke&#x27;s position. After Leopold&#x27;s second flight (27 April 1859) a Tuscan assembly was summoned, and Capponi elected member of it. He voted for the grand duke&#x27;s deposition and for the union of Tuscany with Piedmont. King Victor Emmanuel made him senator in 1860. His last years were devoted almost exclusively to his Florentine history, which was published in 1875 and achieved an immediate success. This was Capponi&#x27;s last work, for on 3 February 1876 he died at the age of eighty-four.
Capponi was one of the best specimens of the Tuscan landlord class. &quot;He represents,&quot; wrote his biographer Tabarrini, &quot;one of the most striking personalities of a generation, all by now deceased, which did not resign itself to the beatitudes of 1815, but wished to raise Italy from the humble state to which the European peace of that year had condemned her; and he succeeded by first raising the character of the Italians in the opinion of foreigners, so as to deserve their esteem and respect.&quot; He knew nearly all the most interesting people in Italy, besides many distinguished foreigners: Giuseppe Giusti, the poet, Alessandro Manzoni, the novelist, Niccolò Tommaseo, Richard Cobden, A von Reumont, the historian, were among those whom he entertained at his palace or his villas, and many were the struggling students and revolutionists to whom he gave assistance.

As a historian his reputation rests on his &quot;Storia della Repubblica di Firenze&quot; (Florence, 1875); it was the first comprehensive Italian book on the subject based on documents and written in a modern critical spirit, and if the chapters on the early history of the city are now obsolete in view of recent discoveries, yet, as a whole, it remains a standard work. Besides his history a large number of essays and pamphlets have been published in his &quot;Scritti inediti&quot;.

<text>Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi (12 August 1804 – 25 September 1873) was an Italian writer and politician involved in the Italian Risorgimento.

==Biography==
Guerrazzi was born in the seaport of Livorno, then part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He studied law at the University of Pisa, graduating in 1824. He began to practice in Livorno, but soon gave up law in favour of politics and literature, being particularly influenced by Byron, to whom he dedicated his &quot;Stanze&quot; (1825). His first novel, &quot;La Battaglia di Benevento&quot; was published in 1827.

Giuseppe Mazzini made his acquaintance, and in 1829, together with Carlo Bini, they started a newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Indicatore Livornese&quot;, at Livorno.

The authorities of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany suppressed the periodical in February 1830 after 48 issues.

In the same year Guerrazzi was banished to Montepulciano for six months after writing an oration to the memory of Cosimo Del Fante — a native of Livorno who had embraced the ideals of the French Revolution and whom Guerrazzi held up as an example for the idealists of the risorgimento. While confined to Montepulciano he began work on his most famous novel, &quot;L&#x27;Assedio di Firenze&quot; - based on and greatly glorifying the life of the 16th Century Florentine soldier Francesco Ferruccio.

Guerrazzi was to be imprisoned several times for his activity in the cause of &quot;Young Italy&quot;; in 1833 he was locked up for three months in the Forte Stella at Portoferraio.

Subsequently, he became the most powerful Liberal leader at Livorno. In 1848 Guerrazzi was appointed a minister, with some idea of mediating between the reformers and the grand duke of Tuscany, Leopold II. On 8 February 1849, following Leopold&#x27;s flight, Guerrazzi formed a governing triumvirate with Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Montanelli and a Tuscan Republic was proclaimed; on 27 March Guerrazzi was nominated dictator.

On Leopold&#x27;s restoration, Guerrazzi refused to flee and he was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. In these years he worked on his &quot;Apologia&quot;, which was published in 1852. After three years in prison his sentence was commuted to exile in Corsica; in 1857 he escaped from the island and lived for some time in Genoa. From 1862 to 1870, he served as a deputy in the Italian parliament at Turin.

Guerrazzi died of a stroke in Cecina some 30 km from his birthplace, Livorno.

His other major works include &quot;Isabella Orsini&quot; (1845) and &quot;Beatrice Cenci&quot; (1854). Moreover, two historic novels placed in Corsica during the 18th century: &quot;La torre di Nonza&quot; (1857) and &quot;Pasquale Paoli ossia la Rotta di Pontenuovo. Racconto Corso del Secolo XVIII&quot; (1860). His collected &quot;Opere&quot; appeared in 1868.

When in 1854 &quot;Beatrice Cenci&quot; was lambasted by Francesco de Sanctis (who now favored the House of Savoy leadership for Italy), he wrote to a friend: &quot;Honoured Alessandro Manzoni, I am put down... to think that as far back as &#x27;40 Britons and Germans saw us as leaders of two different schools, and his they labelled sleep-inducing&quot;.

Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci panned Guerrazzi&#x27;s patriotical works. In one of his prison letters Gramsci refers to Guerrazzi and Bresciani as left and right variants of the same bitterly sectarian type of historical novel.

<text>Helen Frankenthaler (December 12, 1928 – December 27, 2011) was an American abstract expressionist painter. She was a major contributor to the history of postwar American painting. Having exhibited her work for over six decades (early 1950s until 2011), she spanned several generations of abstract painters while continuing to produce vital and ever-changing new work. Frankenthaler began exhibiting her large-scale abstract expressionist paintings in contemporary museums and galleries in the early 1950s. She was included in the 1964 &quot;Post-Painterly Abstraction&quot; exhibition curated by Clement Greenberg that introduced a newer generation of abstract painting that came to be known as color field. Born in Manhattan, she was influenced by Greenberg, Hans Hofmann, and Jackson Pollock&#x27;s paintings. Her work has been the subject of several retrospective exhibitions, including a 1989 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and been exhibited worldwide since the 1950s. In 2001, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

Frankenthaler had a home and studio in Darien, Connecticut.

== Early life and education ==
Helen Frankenthaler was born on December 12, 1928, in New York City. Her father was Alfred Frankenthaler, a New York State Supreme Court judge. Her mother, Martha (Lowenstein), had emigrated with her family from Germany to the United States as an infant. Helen&#x27;s two sisters, Marjorie and Gloria, were six and five years older, respectively. Growing up on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, Frankenthaler absorbed the privileged background of a cultured and progressive Jewish intellectual family that encouraged all three daughters to prepare themselves for professional careers. Her nephew is the artist/photographer Clifford Ross.

Frankenthaler studied at the Dalton School under muralist Rufino Tamayo and also at Bennington College in Vermont. While at Bennington, Frankenthaler studied under the direction of Paul Feeley, who is credited with helping her understand pictorial composition, as well as influencing her early cubist-derived style. Upon her graduation in 1949, she studied privately with Australian-born painter Wallace Harrison, and with Hans Hofmann in 1950. She met Clement Greenberg in 1950 and had a five-year relationship with him. She married the painter Robert Motherwell in 1958; the couple divorced in 1971. Both born of wealthy parents, they were known as &quot;the golden couple&quot; and for their lavish entertaining. She gained two stepdaughters from him, Jeannie Motherwell and Lise Motherwell. Jeannie Motherwell studied painting at Bard College and the Art Students League in New York and had several exhibits.

In 1994, Frankenthaler married Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr., an investment banker who served the Gerald Ford administration.

==Style and technique==

Active as a painter for nearly six decades, Frankenthaler passed through many phases and stylistic shifts. Initially associated with abstract expressionism because of her focus on forms latent in nature, Frankenthaler is identified with the use of fluid shapes, abstract masses, and lyrical gestures. She made use of large formats on which she painted, generally, simplified abstract compositions. Her style is notable in its emphasis on spontaneity, as Frankenthaler herself stated, &quot;A really good picture looks as if it&#x27;s happened at once.&quot;

Frankenthaler&#x27;s official artistic career was launched in 1952 with the exhibition of &quot;Mountains and Sea&quot;. Throughout the 1950s, her works tended to be centered compositions. In 1957, Frankenthaler began to experiment with linear shapes and more organic, sun-like, rounded forms. In the 1960s, her style shifted towards the exploration of symmetrical paintings, as she began to place strips of colors near the edges of her paintings. Her style grew to be more simplified. She began to make use of single stains and blots of solid color against white backgrounds, often in the form of geometric shapes. Beginning in 1963, Frankenthaler began to use acrylic paints rather than oil paints because they allowed for both opacity and sharpness when put on the canvas. By the 1970s, she had done away with the soak stain technique entirely, preferring thicker paint that allowed her to employ bright colors almost reminiscent of Fauvism. Throughout the 1970s, Frankenthaler explored the joining of areas of the canvas through the use of modulated hues, and experimented with large, abstract forms. Her work in the 1980s was characterized as much calmer, with its use of muted colors and relaxed brushwork. &quot;Once one&#x27;s true talent begins to emerge, one is freer in a way but less free in another way, since one is a captive of this necessity and deep urge&quot;.
===Color field painting===

In 1960, the term color field painting was used to describe the work of Frankenthaler. In general, this term refers to the application of large areas, or fields, of color to the canvas. This style was characterized by the use of hues that were similar in tone or intensity, as well as large formats and simplified compositions, all of which are qualities descriptive of Frankenthaler&#x27;s work from the 1960s onward. The color field artists differed from abstract expressionists in their attempted erasure of emotional, mythic, and religious content.

===Technique===
Frankenthaler often painted onto unprimed canvas with oil paints that she heavily diluted with turpentine, a technique that she named &quot;soak stain.&quot; This allowed for the colors to soak directly into the canvas, creating a liquefied, translucent effect that strongly resembled watercolor. Soak stain was also said to be the ultimate fusing of image and canvas, drawing attention to the flatness of the painting itself. The major disadvantage of this method, however, is that the oil in the paints will eventually cause the canvas to discolor and rot away. The technique was adopted by other artists, notably Morris Louis (1912–1962) and Kenneth Noland (1924–2010), and launched the second generation of the color field school of painting. Frankenthaler often worked by laying her canvas out on the floor, a technique inspired by Jackson Pollock.

Frankenthaler preferred to paint in privacy. If assistants were present, she preferred them to be inconspicuous when not needed.

==Influences==

One of her most important influences was Clement Greenberg (1909–1994), an art and literary critic with whom she had a personal friendship and who included her in the &quot;Post-Painterly Abstraction&quot; exhibition that he curated in 1964. Through Greenberg she was introduced to the New York art scene. Under his guidance she spent the summer of 1950 studying with Hans Hofmann (1880–1966), catalyst of the Abstract Expressionist movement.

The first Jackson Pollock show Frankenthaler saw was at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1950. She had this to say about seeing Pollock&#x27;s paintings &quot;Autumn Rhythm, Number 30, 1950&quot; (1950), &quot;Number One,1950 (Lavender Mist)&quot; (1950):

It was all there. I wanted to live in this land. I had to live there, and master the language. 

Some of her thoughts on painting:
John Elderfield wrote that the watercolors of Paul Cézanne and John Marin were important early influences:

==Major works==

===Paintings===
In &quot;Mountains and Sea&quot;, her first professionally exhibited work, Frankenthaler made use of the soak stain technique. The work itself was painted after a trip to Nova Scotia, which partly questions the extent of its non-representational status. Although &quot;Mountains and Sea&quot; is not a direct depiction of the Nova Scotia coastline, elements of the work suggest a kind of seascape or landscape, like the strokes of blue that join with areas of green. Much like &quot;Mountains and Sea&quot;, Frankenthaler&#x27;s &quot;Basque Landscape&quot; (1958) seems to refer to a very specific, external environment, but it is also abstract. The same can be said for &quot;Lorelei&quot; (1956), a work based on a boat ride Frankenthaler took down the Rhine.

&quot;Swan Lake #2&quot; (1961) depicts a large area of blue paint on the canvas, with breaks in the color that are left white. A rectilinear brown square encompasses the blue, balancing both the cool tones of the blue with the warmth of the brown, and the gestural handling of the paint with the strong linearity of the square.

&quot;Eden&quot;, from 1956, is an interior landscape, meaning it depicts the images of the artist&#x27;s imagination. &quot;Eden&quot; tells the story of an abstract, interior world, idealized in ways that a landscape never could be. The work is almost entirely gestural, save for the incorporation of the number &quot;100&quot; two times in the center of the image. When asked about the process of creating this work, Frankenthaler stated that she began by painting the numbers, and that a sort of symbolic, idealized garden grew out of that.

===Prints and woodcuts===
Frankenthaler recognized a need to continually challenge herself to develop as an artist. For this reason, in 1961, she began to experiment with printmaking at the Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), a lithographic workshop in West Islip, Long Island. Frankenthaler collaborated with Tatyana Grosman in 1961 to create her first prints.

In 1976, Frankenthaler began to work within the medium of woodcuts. She collaborated with Kenneth E. Tyler. The first piece they created together was &quot;Essence of Mulberry&quot; (1977), a woodcut that used eight different colors. &quot;Essence of Mulberry&quot; was inspired by two sources: the first was an exhibition of fifteenth century woodcuts that Frankenthaler saw on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the second being a mulberry tree that grew outside of Tyler&#x27;s studio. In 1995, the pair collaborated again, creating &quot;The Tales of Genji&quot;, a series of six woodcut prints. To create woodcuts with a resonance similar to Frankenthaler&#x27;s painterly style, she painted her plans onto the wood itself, making maquettes. &quot;The Tales of Genji&quot; took nearly three years to complete. Frankenthaler then went on to create &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, a print that employed one hundred and two different colors and forty-six woodblocks.

==Awards and legacy==
Frankenthaler received the National Medal of Arts in 2001. She served on the National Council on the Arts of the National Endowment for the Arts from 1985 to 1992. Her other awards include First Prize for Painting at the first Paris Biennial (1959); Temple Gold Medal, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia (1968); New York City Mayor&#x27;s Award of Honor for Arts and Culture (1986); and Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement, College Art Association (1994). In 1990, she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.

Frankenthaler did not consider herself a feminist: &quot;For me, being a &#x27;lady painter&#x27; was never an issue. I don&#x27;t resent being a female painter. I don&#x27;t exploit it. I paint.&quot; Mary Beth Edelson&#x27;s feminist piece &quot;Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper&quot; (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci’s &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, with the heads of notable women artists including Frankenthaler collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became &quot;one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.&quot;

In 1953, Kenneth Noland and Morris Louis saw her &quot;Mountains and Sea&quot; which, Louis said later, was a &quot;bridge between Pollock and what was possible.&quot; On the other hand, some critics called her work &quot;merely beautiful.&quot; Grace Glueck&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; summed up Frankenthaler&#x27;s career:
Critics have not unanimously praised Ms. Frankenthaler&#x27;s art. Some have seen it as thin in substance, uncontrolled in method, too sweet in color and too &quot;poetic.&quot; But it has been far more apt to garner admirers like the critic Barbara Rose, who wrote in 1972 of Ms. Frankenthaler&#x27;s gift for &quot;the freedom, spontaneity, openness and complexity of an image, not exclusively of the studio or the mind, but explicitly and intimately tied to nature and human emotions.

=== Helen Frankenthaler Foundation ===
The New York-based Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, established and endowed by the artist during her lifetime, is dedicated to promoting greater public interest in and understanding of the visual arts. In 2021 the foundation created &quot;Frankenthaler Climate Initiative&quot;. In July 2021, the foundation award the first round of grants totaling $5.1 million. The recipients included the Museo de Arte de Ponce, the Santa Rosa Indian Museum and Cultural Center, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and the Yale University Arts Center.

In a 2023 lawsuit filed at the New York Supreme Court, Frankenthaler’s nephew Frederick Iseman claimed that Clifford Ross and other family members on the board exploited the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation “to advance their own personal interests and careers” and were committed to completely shutting down the foundation in the near future.

==Exhibitions==
Frankenthaler&#x27;s first solo exhibition took place at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York, in the fall of 1951. Her first major museum show, a retrospective of her 1950s work with a catalog by the critic and poet Frank O&#x27;Hara, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, was at the Jewish Museum in 1960. Subsequent solo exhibitions include &quot;Helen Frankenthaler,&quot; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1969; traveled to Whitechapel Gallery, London; Orangerie Herrenhausen, Hanover; and Kongresshalle, Berlin), and &quot;Helen Frankenthaler: a Painting Retrospective,&quot; The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (1989–90; traveled to the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and Detroit Institute of Arts). Miles McEnery Gallery, a New York-based contemporary art gallery which exhibited Color-Field and Abstract Expressionist paintings, showcased a range of her work in 2009 &quot;Helen Frankenthaler,&quot; December 10, 2009 – January 23, 2010). In 2016 her work was included in the exhibition &quot;Women of Abstract Expressionism&quot; organized by the Denver Art Museum. On October 6, 2019, Frankenthaler was included in Sparkling Amazons: Abstract Expressionist Women of the 9th St. Show at the Katonah Museum of Art in Westchester County, NY. which ran until January 26, 2020; *2019: &quot;Postwar Women: alumnae of the Art Students League of New York 1945-1965&quot;, Phyllis Harriman Gallery, Art Students League of NY; curated by Will Corwin.; 2020: &quot;9th Street Club&quot;, Gazelli Art House, London; curated by Will Corwin

In 2021, a decade after her death the New Britain Museum of American Art mounted an exhibition of her works on paper from the final stages of her opus titled &quot;Helen Frankenthaler; Late Works 1990 - 2003&quot;.

In 2023 her work was included in the exhibition &quot;Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940-1970&quot; at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. 

&quot;Every Sound Is a Shape of Time&quot;, a collections-focused group exhibition at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida, showcased Frankenthaler&#x27;s work in the collection alongside Julie Mehretu, Jules Olitski, and Louis Morris, among others.

==National Endowment for the Arts==
She was a presidential appointee to the National Council on the Arts, which advises the NEA&#x27;s chairman. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1989, she argued government funding for the arts was &quot;not part of the democratic process&quot; and was &quot;beginning to spawn an art monster&quot;. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Frankenthaler did take a highly public stance during the late 1980s &#x27;culture wars&#x27; that eventually led to deep budget cuts for the National Endowment for the Arts and a ban on grants to individual artists that still persists. In a 1989 commentary for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she wrote that, while &quot;censorship and government interference in the directions and standards of art are dangerous and not part of the democratic process,&quot; controversial grants to Andres Serrano, Robert Mapplethorpe, and others reflected a trend in which the NEA was supporting work &quot;of increasingly dubious quality. Is the council, once a helping hand, now beginning to spawn an art monster? Do we lose art ... in the guise of endorsing experimentation?&quot;

==Death==
Frankenthaler died on December 27, 2011, at the age of 83 in Darien, Connecticut, following a long and undisclosed illness.

<text>Giuseppe Montanelli (21 January 1813 – 17 June 1862) was an Italian and author.
== Biography ==
Montanelli was born at Fucecchio, then part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. As a boy he was an organist and composer. In 1840, he was appointed law professor at Pisa after graduating law school when he was 18. He contributed to the &quot;Antologia&quot;, a celebrated Florentine review, and in 1847 founded a newspaper called &quot;L&#x27;Italia&quot;, the programme of which was &quot;Reform and Nationality&quot;. In 1848, Montanelli served with the Tuscan student volunteers at the battle of Curtatone, where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Austrians.

After being liberated, Montanelli returned to Tuscany, and the grand duke Leopold II, knowing that he was popular with the masses, sent him to Livorno to quell the disturbances. In October, Leopold, much against his inclinations, asked him to form a ministry. He accepted, and on January 10, 1849, induced the grand duke to establish a national constituent assembly. But Leopold, alarmed at the turn affairs were taking, fled from Florence, and Montanelli, Guerrazzi and Mazzini were elected &quot;triumvirs&quot; of Tuscany. Like Mazzini, Montanelli advocated the union of Tuscany with Rome.

After the restoration of the grand duke, Montanelli, who was in exile in Paris, was tried and condemned by default; he remained some years in France, where he became a partizan of Napoleon III. It was during this time that he was recruited to assist Giuseppe Verdi with the libretto of his 1857 opera which became &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, and this collaboration continued after Verdi left Paris to return to Italy.

On the formation of the Kingdom of Italy, he returned to Tuscany and was elected a member of parliament. Montanelli died at Fucecchio in 1862. Although it has been reported that Indro Montanelli, the 20th-century Italian journalist, is the grandson of Montanelli, there is in fact no relation between the two. Montanelli had no children, and the family name was passed down through his sister as Gori-Montanelli.

<doc id="238328" wikidata="Q1065303" url="?curid=238328" title="Federico Confalonieri">
<text>Count Federico Confalonieri (1785 – 10 December 1846) was an Italian revolutionist.

==Biography==
Confalonieri was born at Milan, descended from a noble Lombard family.

In 1806 he married Teresa Casati. During the Napoleonic period Confalonieri was among the opponents of the French régime, and was regarded as one of the leaders of the Italian national party (&quot;Italiani puri&quot;). At the time of the Milan riots of 1814, when the minister Giuseppe Prina was assassinated, Confalonieri was unjustly accused of complicity in the deed. After the fall of Napoleon he went to Paris with the other Lombard delegates to plead his country&#x27;s cause, advocating the formation of a separate Lombard state under an independent prince. But he received no encouragement, for Lombardy was destined for Austria, and Lord Castlereagh consoled him by saying that &quot;the Austrian government was the most beneficent in the world.&quot; Confalonieri went on to London, in the hope of winning the favour of the British government, but failed in his object. He then joined the freemasons, which was arranged by Timothy Yeats Brown in September 1818, and some of the various other secret societies with which all Europe was swarming, being initiated by Philippe Buonarroti (1761–1837), an old Tuscan Jacobin living in Paris. On returning to Milan, where he found the Austrians in possession, he at first devoted himself to promoting the material progress of his country, but he was ever watching for an opportunity to liberate it from the foreigner.

Early in 1821, when the atmosphere was thick with rumours of revolt, he visited various parts of Italy to sound the liberal leaders, and also corresponded with the Piedmontese officers who, believing that they had the approval of Prince Charles Albert of Carignano, the heir to the throne, were planning a military revolt. There was talk of a rising at Milan combined with a Piedmontese invasion to expel the Austrians, but the plans were very vague and unpractical, for the military conspirators could count only on a few hundred men, and Confalonieri warned them that Lombardy was not ready. On the outbreak of the Piedmontese revolt (March–April 1821) the Austrian authorities made some arrests, and, through the treachery of one conspirator and the foolishness of others, discovered the plot, if it could so be called, and arrested Silvio Pellico and Maroncelli and afterwards Confalonieri.

A long trial now began, conducted with all the rigour and secrecy of the Austrian procedure, and Confalonieri, outwitted by the astute examining magistrate, Antonio Salvotti (d. 1866), contradicted himself, made fatal admissions, even compromised others, and together with several companions was condemned to death for high treason, but through the intercession of his wife and father, who went to Vienna to plead his cause in person, the emperor Francis commuted the penalty to perpetual imprisonment in the fortress of Spielberg (January 1824). Confalonieri was taken to Vienna and had a long interview with Prince Metternich, who tried to extract further confessions incriminating other persons, especially Charles Albert, but although Confalonieri seemed at one time inclined to prepare a report on the revolutionary movement for the emperor, he did not do so, and once he was in prison he refused to say or write another word, and was treated with exceptional severity in consequence.

His wife died in 1830, and in 1836, on the death of the emperor Francis, he was pardoned and exiled to America. He came back to Europe after a year&#x27;s absence, and in 1840 obtained permission to return to Milan to see his dying father. He himself, broken in health and spirits, died on 10 December 1846, too soon to see the accomplishment of Italian freedom. He had undoubtedly played a considerable role in the conspiracy of 1821, being the most influential and richest of the Milanese Liberals; when first arrested his conduct may have been open to criticism, but he more than expiated any temporary weakness due to ill-health and to the barbarous methods of examination by his heroic attitude during his long imprisonment, and his persistent refusal to accept offers of pardon accompanied by dishonouring conditions.

His &quot;Memorie e Lettere&quot; have been edited by Gabrio Casati (2 vols., Milan, 1890). Alessandro D&#x27;Ancona&#x27;s &quot;Federico Confalonieri&quot; (Milan, 1898) is based on the memoirs and on a large number of secret documents from the archives of Vienna and Milan. Alessandro Luzio&#x27;s &quot;Antonio Salvotti e i processi del Ventuno&quot; (Rome, 1901) contains many fresh documents which to some extent exonerate Salvotti from the charge of cruelty; among other papers Metternich&#x27;s account of his interview with Confalonieri is given in full. See also Alessandro Luzio, &quot;Nuovi documenti sul processo Confalonieri&quot; (Rome, 1908).

<doc id="238329" wikidata="Q2291726" url="?curid=238329" title="DotGNU">
<text>DotGNU is a decommissioned part of the GNU Project that started in January 2001 and aimed to provide a free software replacement for Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Framework. The DotGNU project was run by the Free Software Foundation. Other goals of the project are better support for non-Windows platforms and support for more processors.

The main goal of the DotGNU project code base was to provide a class library that is 100% Common Language Specification (CLS) compliant.

==Main development projects==

===Portable.NET===
DotGNU Portable.NET, an implementation of the ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), includes software to compile and run Visual Basic .NET, C#, and C applications that use the .NET base class libraries, XML, and Windows Forms. Portable.NET claims to support various instruction set architectures including x86, PPC, ARM, and SPARC.

===DGEE===
DotGNU Execution Environment (DGEE) is a web service server.

===libJIT===
libJIT is a just-in-time compilation library for development of advanced just-in-time compilation in virtual machine implementations, dynamic programming languages, and scripting languages. It implements an intermediate representation based on three-address code, in which variables are kept in static single assignment form.

libJIT has also seen some use in other open source projects, including GNU Emacs, ILDJIT and HornetsEye.

==Framework architecture==
The Portable .NET class library seeks to provide facilities for application development. These are primarily written in C#, but because of the Common Language Specification they can be used by any .NET language. Like .NET, the class library is structured into Namespaces and Assemblies. It has additional top-level namespaces including Accessibility and DotGNU. In a typical operation, the Portable .NET compiler generates a Common Language Specification (CLS) image, as specified in chapter 6 of ECMA-335, and the Portable .NET runtime takes this image and runs it.

==Free software==
DotGNU points out that it is Free Software, and it sets out to ensure that all aspects of DotGNU minimize dependence on proprietary components, such as calls to Microsoft Windows&#x27; GUI code. DotGNU was one of the High Priority Free Software Projects from till .

==DotGNU and Microsoft&#x27;s patents==

DotGNU&#x27;s implementation of those components of the .NET stack not submitted to the ECMA for standardization has been the source of patent violation concerns for much of the life of the project. In particular, discussion has taken place about whether Microsoft could destroy the DotGNU project through patent suits.

The base technologies submitted to the ECMA may be non-problematic. The concerns primarily relate to technologies developed by Microsoft on top of the .NET Framework, such as ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and Windows Forms (see Non standardized namespaces), i.e. parts composing DotGNU&#x27;s Windows compatibility stack. These technologies are today not fully implemented in DotGNU and are not required for developing DotGNU-applications.

In 2009, Microsoft released .NET Micro Framework under Apache License, Version 2.0, which includes a patent grant. However, the .NET Micro Framework is a reimplementation of the CLR and limited subset of the base class libraries meant for use on embedded devices. Additionally, the patent grant in the Apache License would have protected only contributors and users of the .NET Micro Framework—not users and developers of alternative implementations such as DotGNU or Mono.

In 2014, Microsoft released Roslyn, the next generation official Microsoft C# compiler, under the Apache License. Later that year, Microsoft announced a &quot;reboot&quot; of the official .NET Framework. The framework would be based on .NET Core, including the official runtime and standard libraries released under the MIT License and a patent grant explicitly protecting recipients from Microsoft-owned patents regarding .NET Core.

<doc id="238338" wikidata="Q632404" url="?curid=238338" title="Westinghouse Electric Corporation">
<text>The Westinghouse Electric Corporation was an American manufacturing company founded in 1886 by George Westinghouse and headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was originally named &quot;Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company&quot; and was renamed &quot;Westinghouse Electric Corporation&quot; in 1945. Through the early and mid-20th century, Westinghouse Electric was a powerhouse in heavy industry, electrical production and distribution, consumer electronics, home appliances and a wide variety of other products. They were a major supplier of generators and steam turbines for most of their history, and was also a major player in the field of nuclear power, starting with the Westinghouse Atom Smasher in 1937.

A series of downturns and management missteps in the 1970s and 80s combined with large cash balances led the company to enter the financial services business. Their focus was on mortgages, which suffered significant losses in the late 1980s. In 1992 they announced a major restructuring and the liquidation of their credit operations. In 1995, in a major change of direction, the company acquired the CBS television network and renamed itself CBS Corporation. Most of its remaining industrial businesses were sold off at this time. CBS Corp was acquired by Viacom in 1999, a merger completed in April 2000. The CBS Corporation name was later reused for one of the two companies resulting from the split of Viacom in 2005.

One of the few remaining original lines of business to survive this process was the nuclear power division, which was sold to BNFL in 1999 and re-formed as Westinghouse Electric Company. The Westinghouse trademarks are owned by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and were previously part of Westinghouse Licensing Corporation.

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===
Westinghouse Electric was founded by George Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 8, 1886. Building on the advancement of AC technology in Europe, the firm became active in developing alternating current (AC) electric infrastructure throughout the United States. The company&#x27;s largest factories were located in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Lester, Pennsylvania and Hamilton, Ontario, where they made turbines, generators, motors, and switch gear for the generation, transmission, and use of electricity. In addition to George Westinghouse, early engineers working for the company included Frank Conrad, Benjamin Garver Lamme, Bertha Lamme (first woman mechanical engineer in the United States), Oliver B. Shallenberger, William Stanley, Nikola Tesla, Stephen Timoshenko, and Vladimir Zworykin.

Early on, Westinghouse was a rival to Thomas Edison&#x27;s electric company. In 1892, Edison was merged with Westinghouse&#x27;s chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, making an even bigger competitor, General Electric. 

During the 20th century, Westinghouse engineers and scientists were granted more than 28,000 U.S. patents, the third most of any company. Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company changed its name to Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1945.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Westinghouse experienced a serious setback when the corporation lost over one billion dollars due to bad high-risk, high-fee, high-interest loans made by its Westinghouse Credit Corporation lending arm.

In an attempt to revitalize the corporation, the board of directors appointed outside management in the form of CEO Michael H. Jordan, who brought in numerous consultants to help re-engineer the company in order to realize the potential that they saw in the broadcasting industry. Westinghouse reduced the workforce in many of its traditional industrial operations and made further acquisitions in broadcasting to add to its already substantial Group W network, including Infinity Broadcasting, TNN, CMT, American Radio Systems, and rights to NFL broadcasting. These investments cost the company over fifteen billion dollars. To recoup its costs, Westinghouse sold many other operations, including its defense electronics division, its metering and load control division (which was sold to ABB), its residential security division, the office furniture company Knoll, and Thermo King.

Westinghouse purchased CBS Inc. in 1994 for $5.4 billion. Westinghouse Electric Corporation changed its name to and became the original CBS Corporation in 1997. Also in 1997, the Power Generation Business Unit, headquartered in Orlando, Florida, was sold to Siemens AG of Germany. A year later, CBS sold all of its commercial nuclear power businesses to British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL). In connection with that sale, certain rights to use the Westinghouse trademarks were granted to the newly formed BNFL subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Company. That company was sold to Toshiba in 2006.

== Products and sponsorships ==
*Power generation: The company pioneered the power generation industry and in the fields of long-distance power transmission and high-voltage alternating-current transmission, unveiling the technology for lighting in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.
*Steam turbine generator: The first commercial Westinghouse steam turbine-driven generator, a 1,500 kW unit, began operation at Hartford Electric Light Co. in 1901. The machine, nicknamed Mary-Ann, was the first steam turbine generator to be installed by an electric utility to generate electricity in the US. George Westinghouse had based his original steam turbine design on designs licensed from the English inventor Charles Parsons. Today a large proportion of steam turbine generators operating around the world, ranging to units as large as 1,500 MW (or 1,000 times the original 1901 unit) were supplied by Westinghouse from its factories in Lester, Pennsylvania, Charlotte, North Carolina, or Hamilton, Ont. or were built overseas under Westinghouse license. Major Westinghouse licensees or joint venture partners included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and Harbin Turbine Co. and Shanghai Electric Co. of China.
*Research: Westinghouse had 50,000 employees by 1900 and established a formal research and development department in 1906. While the company was expanding, it would experience internal financial difficulties. During the Panic of 1907, the Board of Directors forced George Westinghouse to take a six-month leave of absence. Westinghouse officially retired in 1909 and died several years later in 1914.
*Electrical technology: Under new leadership, Westinghouse Electric diversified its business activities in electrical technology. It acquired the Copeman Electric Stove Company in 1914 and Pittsburgh High Voltage Insulator Company in 1921. Westinghouse also moved into radio broadcasting by establishing Pittsburgh&#x27;s KDKA, the first commercial radio station, and WBZ in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1921. Westinghouse expanded into the elevator business, establishing the Westinghouse Elevator Company in 1928; it sold its elevator business to Schindler Group (forming the Schindler Elevator Corporation) in 1989. Throughout the decade, diversification engendered considerable growth; sales went from $43 million in 1914 to $216 million in 1929.
*Aviation: Westinghouse produced the first operational American turbojet for the US Navy program in 1943. After many successes, the ill-fated J40 project, started soon after World War Two, was abandoned in 1955 and led to Westinghouse exiting the aircraft engine business with the closure of the Westinghouse Aviation Gas Turbine Division (Kansas City) in 1960.
*Gas turbines: During the late 1940s, Westinghouse applied its aviation gas turbine technology and experience to develop its first industrial gas turbine. A 2,000–horsepower model W21 was installed in 1948 at the Mississippi River Fuel Corp gas compression station in Wilmar, Arkansas. This was the starting point for the company to enter in industrial and utility gas turbine business, prior to the sale by Westinghouse of the power generation business to Siemens AG in 1997. Evolving from the Small Steam and Gas Turbine Division formed in the early 1950s, the Westinghouse Combustion Turbine Systems Division was located in Concordville, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia and the old Lester, Pennsylvania plant, until it was relocated to Power Generation headquarters in Orlando, Florida in 1987.
*Nuclear power: As a result of its participation in the US government&#x27;s military program for nuclear energy applications (e.g., &quot;The Nuclear Navy&quot;) Westinghouse utilized that experience in the development and commercialization of nuclear energy systems for electric power generation. This business currently operates as the Westinghouse Electric Company and is owned by Brookfield Business Partners of Canada. Electricite de France (EDF) a major global player in the nuclear power business, was a long-time licensee of the Westinghouse nuclear technology.
*Industrial motors: Additional major industrial products in the widespread Westinghouse portfolio included electric motors of all sizes, elevators and escalators, controls, and lighting. The Large Motor Division, once headquartered in Buffalo, NY, entered a joint venture with Taiwan Electric Co. (TECO) in the 1970s and today operates as TECO-Westinghouse. Much of Westinghouse&#x27;s higher voltage power equipment was sold to ABB in 1989 and renamed the ABB Power T&amp;D Company.
*Rail transit: The Westinghouse Transportation Division (est. 1894) supplied equipment and controls for many North American interurban and streetcar lines, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit, Washington Metro, New York City Subway equipment from the 1890s elevated era to the R68A in 1988, among many other heavy rail and rail transit systems and built locomotives, often in partnership with Baldwin, Lima-Hamilton as well as supplying electrical and traction equipment for Fairbanks-Morse diesel locomotives. The division designed and built Automated People Movers (APMs) at several major U.S. airports, including Sea-Tac. Tampa, Dallas-Ft. Worth and Orlando. The Transportation Division was sold to AEG of Germany (1988), which merged into a joint venture of ABB and Daimler-Benz named AdTranz in 1996. Ultimately, the unit was acquired by Bombardier of Canada in 2001 and is still headquartered in Pittsburgh.
*Consumer electrics: Westinghouse was also among the initial manufacturers to make household electrical products including radios, televisions, and other audio/video equipment. This also included both small and large electric appliances of all kinds, from hair dryers and electric irons to clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators and air conditioning units. After more than 50 years, and after playing a strong No. 2 to rival General Electric for most of that time, Westinghouse decided to exit the appliance business in the mid-1970s. White-Westinghouse was formed when White Consolidated Industries acquired the Westinghouse appliance unit in 1975.
*World&#x27;s Fair time capsules: The company is also known for its time capsule contributions during the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. They also participated in the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair in 1904. They sponsored the Westinghouse Auditorium at the fair, where they showed films documenting Westinghouse products and company plants. Westinghouse was one of the original corporate sponsors and exhibitors at Walt Disney World&#x27;s EPCOT attraction in Orlando, Florida.

== Environmental incidents ==
There have been a number of Westinghouse-related environmental incidents in the US. Below is a short list of these. All of these are chemical pollution incidents; none of them involve nuclear reactors or nuclear pollution.

*Sharon plant: The Westinghouse Sharon Plant was a 58-acre Westinghouse transformer production facility in Mercer County, Pennsylvania. The EPA&#x27;s recent Five Year Review Report (2016) of this Superfund site determined that the Shenango River has been polluted due to Westinghouse operations in this area. Because of the findings, the state of Pennsylvania has issued a &quot;Do Not Eat&quot; advisory for fish around the Westinghouse site. This plant was no longer operational after 1984. Westinghouse submitted their final cleanup plan in 1998, and further action beyond their dissolution has been liable to CBS. The transformer business unit was sold to ABB in 1989. This site now houses a product design company.
*Adams County plant: Westinghouse was fined $5.5 million in 1996 for polluting groundwater in over 100 wells, as well as other water sources, while operating its Westinghouse Elevator Company plant in Adams County, Pennsylvania. Degreasers and other toxic chemicals were released over a five-year period in the 1980s. This business unit was sold to Schindler in 1988. Future liability for cleanup has been directed to CBS following the dissolution of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1999.
*Horseheads site: Westinghouse operated a cathode-ray tube plant in Horseheads, New York. They were deemed responsible for pollution at the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Superfund site in Horseheads, New York. Westinghouse polluted nearby soil, affecting the safety of a nearby aquifer and wells used by residents. One phase of the cleanup effort describes Westinghouse Electric Corporation&#x27;s facility, designated &quot;Disposal Area F&quot; and the &quot;Former Runoff Basin Area&quot;, which are contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and arsenic, will be cleaned up using a combination of soil excavation and soil vapor extraction. At Disposal Area F, the area of contamination is about 0.3 acres. At the Former Runoff Basin Area, the contaminated soils cover approximately 0.7 acres. Disposal of the excavated soils occurred at appropriate off-site facilities. The removal of the PAHs and arsenic contamination will protect site workers and employees at the Westinghouse facility and the cleanup of the VOCs will help restore the quality of the Newtown Creek Aquifer. In 1986, Westinghouse entered a joint venture at this plant with Toshiba to produce Cathode-Ray Tubes (CRTs). In 1989, Toshiba became part owner of this plant and the Westinghouse CRT business unit. Future liability has been shifted to CBS.
*Sunnyvale plant: Westinghouse operated a plant which manufactured electronics for military systems in Sunnyvale, California. Groundwater and soil near this plant are contaminated with PCBs, fuels, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Potential health threats to area residents include accidentally ingesting or coming into direct contact with site contaminants in soil or groundwater. There are municipal drinking water wells within -mile from this site, and 300,000 people get their drinking water from within three miles of the site. This business unit was sold to Northrop Grumman in 1996. Future liability for this action has been passed on to CBS.

<doc id="238339" wikidata="Q1133735" url="?curid=238339" title="Westinghouse Electric Company">
<text>Westinghouse Electric Company LLC is an American nuclear power company formed in 1999 from the nuclear power division of the original Westinghouse Electric Corporation. It offers nuclear products and services to utilities internationally, including nuclear fuel, service and maintenance, instrumentation, control and design of nuclear power plants. Westinghouse&#x27;s world headquarters are located in the Pittsburgh suburb of Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania.

The company&#x27;s main product is the AP1000, a modern pressurized water reactor (PWR) design with many passive safety features and modular construction intended to lower construction time and cost. Twelve AP1000 reactors are currently in operation with a further nineteen in various stages of planning.

The company was initially formed as CBS Corporation spun off the remaining pieces of Westinghouse&#x27;s industrial concerns, as part of Westinghouse&#x27;s re-creation as a media company. Portions of their nuclear business were initially purchased by Siemens in 1998 before the remaining parts were purchased by British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) in 1999 and formed up as Westinghouse Electric. In 2005, BNFL sold the company to Toshiba. 

The company went bankrupt in 2017 primarily due to ongoing cost overruns at the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant expansion, the first US build of the company&#x27;s AP1000 design. It emerged from bankruptcy after being purchased by Brookfield Business Partners, a Canadian private equity fund. They sold it to a consortium of Brookfield Renewable Partners and Cameco, a Canadian nuclear fuel and services company. Renewable Partners is the current majority owner of Westinghouse.

==History==

Westinghouse Electric Company was formed in 1999, after the original company with that name, George Westinghouse&#x27;s Westinghouse Electric, founded in 1886, ceased to exist due to a series of divestitures and mergers through the mid-to-late 1990s. These included Westinghouse Electric&#x27;s purchase of CBS in 1995, expansion into communications and broadcasting, and the selling off of most non-broadcast operations by 1998, renaming itself CBS Corporation. 

In 1998, the Westinghouse Power Generation Business unit was sold to Siemens of Germany. In 1999, CBS Corporation sold its nuclear business (&quot;Westinghouse Electric Company&quot;) to British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) and a year later CBS Corporation was merged into Viacom (1971–2005), putting an end to the &quot;original&quot; Westinghouse. Legally, Westinghouse Electric Corporation still exists, mainly for the purpose of licensing, as a subsidiary of CBS Corporation.

===Sale to Toshiba===
In July 2005, BNFL confirmed it planned to sell Westinghouse, then estimated to be worth $2 billion. This attracted interest from several companies, including Toshiba, General Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. When the Financial Times reported on January 23, 2006 that Toshiba had won the bid, it valued the company&#x27;s offer at $5bn (£2.8bn). On February 6, 2006 Toshiba confirmed it was buying Westinghouse Electric Company for $5.4bn and announced it would sell a minority stake to investors. 

The sale surprised many industry experts who questioned the wisdom of BNFL selling one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of nuclear reactors shortly before the market for nuclear power was expected to grow substantially; China, the United States and the United Kingdom were all expected to invest heavily in nuclear power. After the 2005 Indo-US nuclear deal, there was also hope that India&#x27;s plan of massive investment in nuclear plants would help to revive the U.S. nuclear power industry. 

Reasons in favor of a sale were: The commercial risk of the company&#x27;s business in Asia may have been too high for a company then owned by taxpayers; if Westinghouse won the bid for any new nuclear stations in a UK competition, questions may be raised of favoritism, but if it lost, it might have been seen as a lack of faith in its own technology. Finally, the record of UK governments building nuclear plants had been a commercial disaster. 
On October 16, 2006 the acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Company for $5.4 billion was completed, with Toshiba obtaining a 77% share, partners The Shaw Group a 20% share and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. a 3% share. On 13 August 2007 Toshiba sold 10% to Kazatomprom, the national uranium company for the Republic of Kazakhstan, for US$540 million, leaving Toshiba with 67%. Kazatomprom&#x27;s ownership was entirely passive, with no voting or veto rights or presence on the board of directors.

In September, 2011, Toshiba was reported to be in talks to acquire the Shaw stake and both companies confirmed the story soon thereafter. Shaw CEO James Bernhard said, that Toshiba was paying US$1.6 Bn for the Shaw-owned 20% stake, and that it was the 50% rise in the yen on its yen-denominated debt over five years, which had led it to exercise its sale option. Toshiba said in late 2012 it was open to, and considering, having other partners invest in the business. The purchase closed in January 2013, and brought Toshiba&#x27;s share in the company to 87% as a result of Shaw exercising its option.

===Move to Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania===
After several years of doing business there, Westinghouse decided to move its world headquarters from the Energy Center in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, to Cranberry Woods in Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania, as reported in a 2007 memo to its employees that stated the main reason was the rapid expansion of the global nuclear industry. Construction began in July 2007 and the move lasted from June 2009 to December 2010. 

The Repair, Replacement and Automation Services (RRAS) business segment moved to Cranberry Township earlier than other business segments to help alleviate space issues at the headquarters in Monroeville and was completed in spring of 2008. As part of this move, Westinghouse piloted the first commuter shuttle running an all-day loop between Monroeville and Cranberry Township. The shuttle ceased operation after Westinghouse formally closed, and sold their Monroeville facility in 2012.

===2015 accounting difficulties===
In 2015, concerns were expressed that the value of assets and goodwill in Westinghouse were overstated. Following an accounting scandal in which profits were overstated at Toshiba, leading to the CEO resigning, Toshiba stated that the Westinghouse nuclear business was more profitable than at acquisition in 2006.

In December 2016, Toshiba said it expected to write down its investment in Westinghouse by US$2.5 billion, adding that it was possible that their investment in Westinghouse could ultimately have a negative worth, due to cost overruns at U.S. nuclear reactors it was building.

In February 2017, Toshiba revealed unaudited details of a 390 billion yen ($3.4 billion) loss, mainly in its US nuclear business which was written down by 712 billion yen ($6.3 billion). On 14 February 2017, Toshiba delayed filing financial results, and Toshiba chairman Shigenori Shiga, formerly chairman of Westinghouse, resigned. Toshiba considered selling the Westinghouse nuclear business.

===2017 Chapter 11 bankruptcy===

On 29 March 2017, Toshiba&#x27;s Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing a yearly loss for Toshiba that could exceed $9 billion, almost three times its previous estimate.

The projects responsible for this loss were mostly the construction of four AP1000 reactors at Vogtle in Georgia and Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the four nuclear reactors being built in the southeastern U.S. would be left to an unknown fate. 

In July, 2017, the co-owners of the V.C. Summer plant announced that the project was terminated. On September 24, 2017, the Post &amp; Courier reported that Westinghouse had hired unlicensed workers to create mechanical and electrical blueprints for the V.C. Summer expansion without having a professional engineer sign off on them which was in violation of state law. The blueprints were often faulty and led to significant delays. The U.S. government had given $8.3 billion of loan guarantees on the financing of the four nuclear reactors being built in the U.S.

Besides the issues with the AP1000 design, the fuel manufacturing division has been profitable, but not enough to cover corporate overheads and support the other divisions. Research and development investment in fuel manufacturing has been low, which has impacted the quality and comparative performance of its fuel compared to competitors.

=== 2018 sale to Brookfield Business Partners ===
On 6 April 2018, Toshiba announced the completion of the sale of Westinghouse&#x27;s holding company to Brookfield Business Partners (a subsidiary of Canadian investment management company Brookfield Asset Management Inc.) and some partners for $4.6bn.

=== Sale to Brookfield Renewable Partners and Cameco ===
In October 2022, Brookfield Renewable Partners (another subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management) and Cameco announced the acquisition of Westinghouse Electric from Brookfield Business Partners in a US$7.9billion deal including debt. Brookfield Renewable and its institutional partners will own a 51% interest in Westinghouse, while Cameco will own remaining 49% as part of the deal.

The acquisition was completed in November 2023.

==Association with Paramount Global==

Although no longer associated with CBS Corporation (now Paramount Global), Westinghouse Electric Company LLC has for some years used the trademarks owned by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, by then Viacom/CBS Corporation/ViacomCBS&#x27; &quot;brand management&quot; subsidiary, under license, as is the case with other Westinghouse licensees. In 2021, ViacomCBS sold the Westinghouse licensing operation (including trademarks) directly to the now-independent Westinghouse Electric Corporation.

==New generation of reactors==
A revived interest in the nuclear power generation field in the late 1980s led to Westinghouse&#x27;s development of the AP600 reactor which received NRC approval. Interest in the Westinghouse design, but with larger power output led to the change of the project to the AP1000 in 1999 and shortly after became the first Generation III+ reactor to receive final design approval from the NRC in 2004. As of 2014, four of these units are under construction in China, though the first was due to come on-line in November 2013. and has been delayed until December 2014. 

The delay due to the constantly changing, and consequently untested, design prompted Li Yulun, former vice-president of China National Nuclear Corporation, in 2013 to raise concerns over the safety standards of the plant. Citing a lack of operating history, he questioned the manufacturer&#x27;s assertion that the AP1000 reactor&#x27;s &quot;primary system canned motor pumps&quot; were &quot;maintenance-free&quot; over 60 years, the assumed life of the reactor, and noted that Westinghouse had yet to receive approval from British authorities on an improved version of AP1000. As of 2019 all four AP1000 reactors in China are operating.

As of January 2009, six AP1000 plants had been ordered in the US, and several other customers had chosen the AP1000, if they were to build new nuclear plants, for a combined total of at least 14 new plants, announced by the NuStart Consortium, Duke Power, Progress Energy, Southern Nuclear and SCE&amp;G. In May 2011 after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, US government regulators found problems with the design of the shield building of the new reactors. Gregory Jaczko, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since 2005 said that computations submitted by Westinghouse about the building&#x27;s design appeared to be wrong and &quot;had led to more questions.&quot; He said the company had not used a range of possible temperatures for calculating potential seismic stresses on the shield building in the event of an earthquake, for example. The NRC asked Westinghouse not only to fix its calculations, but also to explain why it submitted flawed information in the first place. Westinghouse countered that the &quot;confirmatory items&quot; that the commission was asking for were not &quot;safety significant.&quot;

In November 2011, the AP1000 Oversight Group published a report highlighting six areas of major concern and un-reviewed safety questions requiring immediate technical review by the NRC. The report concluded that certification of the AP1000 should be delayed until the original and current &quot;unanswered safety questions&quot; raised by the AP1000 Oversight Group are resolved.

In December 2011, the UK&#x27;s Office for Nuclear Regulation published a design assessment report on the AP1000 reactor which highlighted 51 &#x27;Generic Design Assessment&#x27; issues remaining that must be addressed before the assessment would be completed.

In October 2013, US energy secretary Ernest Moniz announced that China was to supply components to the US nuclear power plants under construction as part of a bilateral co-operation agreement between the two countries. Since China&#x27;s State Nuclear Power Technology Co (SNPTC) acquired Westinghouses&#x27;s AP1000 technology in 2006, it has developed a manufacturing supply chain capable of supplying international power projects. Industry analysts have pointed out that there are gaps in the Chinese supply chain.

==International business==

===Europe===
Westinghouse Electric Company fully owns several subsidiaries in Europe, such as the European Service Center, also called Westinghouse Electric Belgium located in Nivelles, Belgium, where equipment is prepared for projects throughout Europe. After Westinghouse&#x27;s 1990 takeover of ABB Reaktor in Germany, it transferred radiological storage activities located in Ladenburg, Germany, to consolidate in Nivelles, which had to be extended. Soon afterwards another expansion was necessary as employees in the Brussels office were transferred to Nivelles. It was estimated that 200 people were working in Nivelles at the end of 2011.

In 2001, Westinghouse took over Logitest in Les Ulis, France, one of 3 companies qualified to inspect nuclear steam generator plants for Électricité de France. After the French nuclear market partially opened in 2004 to suppliers from outside the country to fulfill European Commission directives regarding international competition, Westinghouse started to expand its business in France with a
Westinghouse team located in Metz in charge of repair, replacement and automation services. By 2005, Westinghouse had 160 employees in France and two-thirds of Westinghouse&#x27;s business in France was fuel supply. Westinghouse Electrique France is located in Orsay and Manosque near Marseille (engineering development). As of 2014, about 400 employees are part of Westinghouse in France.

Westinghouse owns a nuclear fuel fabrication plant at Västerås, Sweden which has provided nuclear fuel for Russian VVER-1000 nuclear reactors. In 2000 Westinghouse started development of fuel for customers in Finland and Hungary, supported by cheap Export–Import Bank of the United States loans, but the business remained small-scale in competition from cheaper Russian suppliers. A 2008 contract was agreed to supply VVER-1000 fuel; however, in trial use the fuel became deformed. 

In 2015, the European Union awarded $2 million in funding to a Westinghouse-led consortium to support the development of a more competitive fuel for the Russian built reactors. In 2018, the contract to supply VVER fuel was extended to 2025. In 2018, Westinghouse, under a further EU-funded project, started developing VVER-440 fuel.

In October 2022, Westinghouse was selected to build Poland&#x27;s first nuclear power plant based on three AP1000 reactors, with possibly a further three at a later date.

Westinghouse also has business locations in Italy, Germany, Spain, the UK, Russia, and Bulgaria.

===Asia===
In South Korea, Westinghouse has been involved in the construction of new nuclear plants since 1972, with the first plant Kori Nuclear Power Plant starting up in 1977 and in commercial operation in 1978, followed by eight reactors under construction in the early 1980s. Combustion Engineering (now Westinghouse) entered into a ten-year technology transfer program with the Korean nuclear industry aiming at self-reliance, which was extended in 1997.

In December, 2006, China&#x27;s State Nuclear Power Technology Company (SNPTC) selected Westinghouse to provide four new AP1000 nuclear power plants. The first was due to come on line in 2013, but has been delayed until the end of 2014.

On 7 June 2016, Nuclear Power corporation of India have agreed to begin engineering and site design work for six nuclear power reactors in India and to conclude contractual agreements by June 2017.

===Africa===
Westinghouse has been involved in South Africa through support of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station since the 1990s, both reactors are Westinghouse-licensed. In 2007, Westinghouse acquired IST Nuclear (Pty) Ltd, and won the final bidding process for new nuclear plants in South Africa, for which it signed an MOU in 2013. IST Nuclear provides services and systems for the pebble-bed reactor.

<doc id="238341" wikidata="Q159907" url="?curid=238341" title="David Hockney">
<text>David Hockney (born 9 July 1937) is an English painter, draughtsman, printmaker, stage designer, and photographer. As an important contributor to the pop art movement of the 1960s, he is considered one of the most influential British artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Hockney has owned residences and studios in Bridlington and London as well as two residences in California, where he has lived intermittently since 1964: one in the Hollywood Hills, one in Malibu. He has an office and stores his archives on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, California.

On 15 November 2018, Hockney&#x27;s 1972 work &quot;Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)&quot; sold at Christie&#x27;s auction house in New York City for $90 million (£70 million), becoming the most expensive artwork by a living artist sold at auction. It broke the previous record which was set by the 2013 sale of Jeff Koons&#x27; &quot;Balloon Dog (Orange)&quot; for $58.4 million. Hockney held the record until 15 May 2019 when Koons reclaimed the honour by selling his &quot;Rabbit&quot; for more than $91 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York.

==Early life and education==
David Hockney was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, the fourth of five children of Kenneth Hockney (1904-1978) who was an accountant&#x27;s clerk who later ran his own accountancy business, and who had been a conscientious objector in the Second World War, and Laura (1900-1999) née Thompson, a devout Methodist and strict vegetarian. He was educated at Wellington Primary School, Bradford Grammar School, Bradford College of Art (his teachers there included Frank Lisle and his fellow students included Derek Boshier, Pauline Boty, Norman Stevens, David Oxtoby, and John Loker) and the Royal College of Art in London, where he met R. B. Kitaj and Frank Bowling.

At the Royal College of Art, Hockney featured – alongside Peter Blake – in the exhibition &quot;New Contemporaries&quot;, which announced the arrival of British Pop art. He was associated with the movement, but his early works display expressionist elements which are similar to some of Francis Bacon&#x27;s works. 

When the RCA said it would not let him graduate if he did not complete an assignment of a life drawing of a live model in 1962, Hockney painted &quot;Life Painting for a Diploma&quot; in protest. He had refused to write an essay required for the final examination and said that he should be assessed solely on his artworks. Recognising his talent and growing reputation, the RCA changed its regulations and awarded him a diploma. After leaving the RCA, he taught at Maidstone College of Art for a short time. He taught at the University of Iowa in 1964. Hockney also taught at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1965. Next he taught at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1966 to 1967 and then at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967.

==Career==
In 1964, Hockney moved to Los Angeles, where he was inspired to make a series of paintings of swimming pools in the comparatively new acrylic medium using vibrant colours. He lived at various times in Los Angeles, London, and Paris from the late 1960s to 1970s. In 1974 he began a decade-long personal relationship with Gregory Evans who moved with him to the US in 1976 and as of 2019 remains a business partner. 

In 1978 he rented a home in the Hollywood Hills; he later bought and expanded the house to include his studio. He also owned a 1,643-square-foot beach house at 21039 Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, which he sold in 1999 for about $1.5 million. In the 1990s, Hockney returned more often to Yorkshire, usually every three months, to visit his mother who died in 1999. Until 1997, he rarely stayed for more than two weeks, when his friend Jonathan Silver who was terminally ill, encouraged him to capture the local surroundings. At first he did this with paintings based on memory, some from his boyhood. In 1998, he completed his painting of the Yorkshire landmark, Garrowby Hill. Hockney returned to Yorkshire for increasingly longer stays and by 2003 was painting the countryside &quot;en plein air&quot; in both oils and watercolour. 

He set up residence and studio in a converted bed and breakfast, in the seaside town of Bridlington, about from where he was born. The oil paintings he produced after 2005 were influenced by his intensive studies in watercolour, a series titled &quot;Midsummer: East Yorkshire&quot; (2003–2004). He created paintings made of multiple smaller canvases — two to fifty — placed together. To help him visualise work at that scale, he used digital photographic reproductions to study the day&#x27;s work. In spring 2020 he stayed at La Grande Cour, a farmhouse and studio in Normandy, during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

==Work==
Hockney has experimented with painting, drawing, printmaking, watercolours, photography, and many other media including a fax machine, paper pulp, computer applications and iPad drawing programs. The subject matter of interest ranges from still lifes to landscapes, portraits of friends, his dogs, and stage designs for the Royal Court Theatre, Glyndebourne, and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.

===Portraits===

Hockney has returned to painting portraits throughout his career. From 1968, and for the next few years, he painted portraits and double portraits of friends, lovers, and relatives just under life-size in a realistic style that adroitly captured the likenesses of his subjects. Hockney has repeatedly been drawn to the same subjects – his family, employees, artists Mo McDermott and Maurice Payne, various writers he has known, fashion designers Celia Birtwell and Ossie Clark (&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Clark and Percy&quot;, 1970–71), curator Henry Geldzahler, art dealer Nicholas Wilder, George Lawson and his ballet dancer lover, Wayne Sleep, and also his romantic interests throughout the years, including Peter Schlesinger and Gregory Evans. Perhaps more than all of these, Hockney has turned to his own figure year after year, creating over 300 self-portraits.

From 1999 to 2001 Hockney used a camera lucida for his research into art history as well as his own work in the studio. He created over 200 drawings of friends, family, and himself using this antique lens-based device.

In 2016, the Royal Academy exhibited Hockney&#x27;s series entitled &quot;82 Portraits and 1 Still-life&quot; which traveled to Ca&#x27; Pesaro in Venice, Italy, and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, in 2017 and to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2018. Hockney calls the paintings started in 2013 &quot;twenty-hour exposures&quot; because each sitting took six to seven hours on three consecutive days.

=== Printmaking ===
Hockney experimented with printmaking as early as a lithograph &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; in 1954 and worked in etchings during his time at RCA. In 1965, the print workshop Gemini G.E.L. approached him to create a series of lithographs with a Los Angeles theme. Hockney responded by creating &quot;The Hollywood Collection&quot;, a series of lithographs recreating the art collection of a Hollywood star, each piece depicting an imagined work of art within a frame. Hockney went on to produce many other portfolios with Gemini G.E.L. including &quot;Friends, The Weather Series&quot;, and &quot;Some New Prints&quot;. During the 1960s he produced several series of prints he thought of as &#x27;graphic tales&#x27;, including &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1961–63) after Hogarth, &quot;Illustrations for Fourteen Poems from C.P. Cavafy&quot; (1966) and &quot;Illustrations for Six Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm&quot; (1969).

In 1973 Hockney began a fruitful collaboration with Aldo Crommelynck, Picasso&#x27;s preferred printer. In his atelier, he adopted Crommelynck&#x27;s trademark sugar lift, as well as a system of the master&#x27;s own devising of imposing a wooden frame onto the plate to ensure colour separation. Their early work together included &quot;Artist and Model&quot; (1973–74) and &quot;Contrejour in the French Style&quot; (1974). In 1976–77 Hockney created &quot;The Blue Guitar&quot;, a suite of 20 etchings, each utilising Crommelynck&#x27;s techniques and filled with references to Picasso. The frontispiece to the suite mentions Hockney&#x27;s dual inspiration; &quot;The Blue Guitar: Etchings By David Hockney Who Was Inspired By Wallace Stevens Who Was Inspired By Pablo Picasso&quot;. The etchings refer to themes in a poem by Wallace Stevens, &quot;The Man with the Blue Guitar&quot;. It was published by Petersburg Press in October 1977. That year, Petersburg also published a book in which the images were accompanied by the poem&#x27;s text.

In the summer of 1978, David Hockney stayed for six weeks with his friend the printer Ken Tyler at Tyler&#x27;s studio in New York, Tyler Graphics Ltd. Tyler invited Hockney to try a new technique with liquid paper. The process is painting with the paper itself, so the artist had to do it himself by hand. Each image becomes a unique work between printmaking and painting. In six weeks, Hockney created a total of 29 artworks with a series of 17 sunflowers and swimming pools. Many of the works are very similar, differentiated by changes in colour choice and application of the colour. Some are solely coloured using paper pulp, while some use spray paint to achieve certain details.

Some of Hockney&#x27;s other print portfolios include &quot;Home Made Prints&quot; (1986), &quot;Recent Etchings&quot; (1998) and &quot;Moving Focus&quot; (1984–1986), which contains lithographs related to &quot;A Walk Around the Hotel Courtyard, Acatlan&quot;. A retrospective of his prints, including &#x27;computer drawings&#x27; printed on fax machines and inkjet printers, was exhibited at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London 5 February – 11 May 2014 and Bowes Museum, County Durham 7 June – 28 September 2014, with an accompanying publication, &quot;Hockney, Printmaker&quot;, by Richard Lloyd.

===Photocollages===
In the early 1980s, Hockney began to produce photo collages — which, in his early explorations within his personal photo albums, he referred to as &quot;joiners&quot; — first using Polaroid prints and subsequently 35mm, commercially processed colour prints. Using Polaroid snaps or photolab-prints of a single subject, Hockney arranged a patchwork to make a composite image. Because the photographs are taken from different perspectives and at slightly different times, the result is work that has an affinity with Cubism, one of Hockney&#x27;s major aims — discussing the way human vision works. Some pieces are landscapes, such as &quot;Pearblossom Highway #2&quot;, others portraits including &quot;Kasmin 1982&quot;; and &quot;My Mother, Bolton Abbey, 1982&quot;.

Creation of the &quot;joiners&quot; occurred accidentally. He noticed in the late 1960s that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together, not intending for them to be a composition on their own. On looking at the final composition, he realised it created a narrative, as if the viewer moved through the room. He began to work more with photography after this discovery, stopping painting for a while to pursue this new technique exclusively.

However over time, he discovered what he could &quot;not&quot; capture with a lens, saying: &quot;Photography seems to be rather good at portraiture, or can be. But, it can&#x27;t tell you about space, which is the essence of landscape. For me anyway. Even Ansel Adams can&#x27;t quite prepare you for what Yosemite looks like when you go through that tunnel and you come out the other side.&quot; Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its &#x27;one-eyed&#x27; approach, he returned to painting.

===Other technology===
In December 1985 Hockney used the Quantel Paintbox, a computer that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen. The resulting work was featured in a BBC series that profiled several artists. In 1999–2001, David&#x27;s sister, Margaret, began experimenting with digital photography, scanning and computer printing, particularly making images of flowers scanning a small Japanese vase and fresh flowers. In 2003, she was experimenting with Photoshop, scanning summer flowers and building up images in layers which Margaret printed out on an A3 printer. In 2004, David went to stay with Margaret and she helped him scan his sketchbook of Yorkshire landscape and David soon began using a Wacom pad and pen directly into Photoshop.

Since 2009, Hockney has painted hundreds of portraits, still lifes and landscapes using the Brushes iPhone and iPad application, often sending them to his friends. In 2010 and 2011, Hockney visited Yosemite National Park to draw its landscape on his iPad. He used an iPad in designing a stained glass window at Westminster Abbey which celebrated the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Unveiled in September 2018, the Queen&#x27;s Window is located in the north transept of the Abbey and features a hawthorn blossom scene which is set in Yorkshire.

From 2010 to 2014, Hockney created multi-camera movies using three to eighteen cameras to record a single scene. He filmed the landscape of Yorkshire in various seasons, jugglers and dancers, and his own exhibitions within the de Young Museum and the Royal Academy of Arts. His earlier photo collages influenced his shift to another medium, digital photography. He combined hundreds of photographs to create multi-viewpoint &quot;photographic drawings&quot; of groups of his friends in 2014. Hockney picked the process back up in 2017, this time using the more advanced Agisoft PhotoScan photogrammetric software which allowed him to stitch together and rearrange thousands of photos. The resulting images were printed out as massive photomurals and were exhibited at Pace Gallery and LACMA in 2018.

=== Plein air landscapes ===
In June 2007, Hockney&#x27;s largest painting, &quot;Bigger Trees Near Warter or/ou Peinture sur le Motif pour le Nouvel Age Post-Photographique&quot;, which measures , was hung in the Royal Academy&#x27;s largest gallery in its annual Summer Exhibition. This work &quot;is a monumental-scale view of a coppice in Hockney&#x27;s native Yorkshire, between Bridlington and York. It was painted on 50 individual canvases, mostly working in situ, over five weeks last winter.&quot; In 2008, he donated it to Tate in London, saying: &quot;I thought if I&#x27;m going to give something to the Tate I want to give them something really good. It&#x27;s going to be here for a while. I don&#x27;t want to give things I&#x27;m not too proud of... I thought this was a good painting because it&#x27;s of England... it seems like a good thing to do.&quot; The painting was the subject of a BBC1 Imagine film documentary by Bruno Wollheim called &quot;David Hockney: A Bigger Picture&quot; (2009) which followed Hockney as he worked outdoors over the preceding two years.

===Theatre works===
Hockney&#x27;s first stage designs were for &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre in 1966, Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in England in 1975, and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; for Glyndebourne in 1978. In 1980, he agreed to design sets and costumes for a 20th-century French triple bill at the Metropolitan Opera House with the title &quot;Parade&quot;. The works were &quot;Parade&quot;, a ballet with music by Erik Satie; &quot;Les mamelles de Tirésias&quot;, an opera with libretto by Guillaume Apollinaire and music by Francis Poulenc, and &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot;, an opera with libretto by Colette and music by Maurice Ravel. The reimagined set of &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot; from the 1983 exhibition &quot;Hockney Paints the Stage&quot; is a permanent installation at the Spalding House branch of the Honolulu Museum of Art. He designed sets for another triple bill of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Le sacre du printemps, Le rossignol&quot;, and &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; for the Metropolitan Opera in 1981 as well as Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; for the Los Angeles Music Center Opera in 1987, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; in 1991 at the Chicago Lyric Opera, and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; in 1992 at the Royal Opera House in London. In 1994, he designed costumes and scenery for twelve opera arias for the TV broadcast of Plácido Domingo&#x27;s &quot;Operalia&quot; in Mexico City. Technical advances allowed him to become increasingly complex in model-making. At his studio he had a proscenium opening by in which he built sets in 1:8 scale. He also used a computerised setup that let him punch in and program lighting cues at will and synchronise them to a soundtrack of the music.

In 2017, Hockney was awarded the San Francisco Opera Medal on the occasion of the revival and restoration of his production for &quot;Turandot&quot;. The majority of his theatre works and stage design studies are found in the collection of The David Hockney Foundation.

==Exhibitions==
David Hockney has been featured in over 400 solo exhibitions and over 500 group exhibitions. He had his first one-man show at Kasmin Limited when he was 26 in 1963, and by 1970 the Whitechapel Gallery in London had organised the first of several major retrospectives, which subsequently travelled to three European institutions. LACMA also hosted a retrospective exhibition in 1988 which travelled to The Met, New York, and Tate, London. In 2004, he was included in the cross-generational Whitney Biennial, where his portraits appeared in a gallery with those of a younger artist he had inspired, Elizabeth Peyton.

In October 2006, the National Portrait Gallery in London organised one of the largest ever displays of Hockney&#x27;s portraiture work, including 150 paintings, drawings, prints, sketchbooks, and photocollages from over five decades. The collection ranged from his earliest self-portraits to work he completed in 2005. Hockney assisted in displaying the works and the exhibition, which ran until January 2007, was one of the gallery&#x27;s most successful. In 2009, &quot;David Hockney: Just Nature&quot; attracted some 100,000 visitors at the Kunsthalle Würth in Schwäbisch Hall, Germany.
From 21 January 2012 to 9 April 2012, the Royal Academy presented &quot;A Bigger Picture&quot;, which included more than 150 works, many of which take entire walls in the gallery&#x27;s brightly lit rooms. The exhibition is dedicated to landscapes, especially trees and tree tunnels of his native Yorkshire. Works included oil paintings, watercolours, and drawings created on an iPad and printed on paper. Hockney said, in a 2012 interview, &quot;It&#x27;s about big things. You can make paintings bigger. We&#x27;re also making photographs bigger, videos bigger, all to do with drawing.&quot; The exhibition drew more than 600,000 visitors in under 3 months. The exhibition moved to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain from 15 May to 30 September, and from there to the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany, between 27 October 2012 and 3 February 2013.

From 26 October 2013 to 30 January 2014 &quot;David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition&quot; was presented at the de Young Museum, one of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. The largest solo exhibition Hockney has had, with 397 works of art in more than 18,000 square feet, was curated by Gregory Evans and included the only public showing of &quot;The Great Wall&quot;, developed during research for &quot;Secret Knowledge&quot;, and works from 1999 to 2013 in a variety of media from camera lucida drawings to watercolours, oil paintings, and digital works.

From 9 February to 29 May 2017 &quot;David Hockney&quot; was presented at the Tate Britain, becoming the most-visited exhibition in the gallery&#x27;s history. The exhibition marked Hockney&#x27;s 80th year and gathered together &quot;an extensive selection of David Hockney&#x27;s most famous works celebrating his achievements in painting, drawing, print, photography and video across six decades&quot;. Tabish Khan in his five-star review for Londonist draws attention to Hockney&#x27;s adaptation of new technology for the exhibition stating “What we love the most about Hockney is that he doesn&#x27;t stop experimenting with age. Many of his iPad drawings are on display and while not his finest work, they show he&#x27;s willing to try out new tools and techniques”. The show then travelled to Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The wildly popular retrospective landed among the top ten ticketed exhibitions in London and Paris for 2017 with over 4,000 visitors per day at the Tate and over 5,000 visitors per day in Paris.

After the blockbuster exhibitions in 2017 of the works of decades past, Hockney went on to display his newest paintings on hexagonal canvases and mural-size 3D photographic drawings at Pace Gallery in 2018. He revisited paintings of Garrowby Hill, the Grand Canyon, and Nichols Canyon Road, this time painting them on hexagonal canvases to enhance aspects of reverse perspective. In 2019, his early work featured in his native Yorkshire at The Hepworth Wakefield.
In April–June 2022 an exhibition &quot;Hockney&#x27;s Eye: The Art and Technology of Depiction&quot; was held at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge and at the city&#x27;s Heong Gallery. In 2023 the Honolulu Museum of Art (HoMA) presented &quot;David Hockney: Perspective Should Be Reversed, Prints from the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation.&quot; The exhibition is the largest retrospective print exhibition of Hockney&#x27;s career, with more than 100 colourful prints, collages and photographic and iPad drawings, in a variety of media, spanning six decades of the artist&#x27;s career.

==Personal life==
Hockney came out as gay when he was 23, while studying at the Royal College of Art in London. Britain decriminalised homosexual acts seven years later in the Sexual Offences Act 1967. Hockney has explored the nature of gay love in his work, such in as the painting &quot;We Two Boys Together Clinging&quot; (1961), named after a poem by Walt Whitman. In 1963 he painted two men together in the painting &quot;Domestic Scene, Los Angeles&quot;, one showering while the other washes his back. In the summer of 1966, while teaching at UCLA, he met Peter Schlesinger, an art student who posed for paintings and drawings, and with whom he became romantically involved. Another of Hockney&#x27;s romantic partners who was the subject of his work was Gregory Evans; the two met in 1971 and began a relationship in 1974. While no longer romantically involved, they still work together, with Evans managing the David Hockney Studio. Hockney&#x27;s current partner is longtime companion Jean-Pierre Gonçalves de Lima. Also known as JP, he also works with Hockney in his studio as his chief assistant.

In March 2013, Hockney&#x27;s 23-year-old assistant, Dominic Elliott, died as a result of drinking drain cleaner at Hockney&#x27;s Bridlington studio; he had earlier taken both drugs and alcohol. Hockney&#x27;s partner drove Elliott to Scarborough General Hospital where he later died. The inquest returned a verdict of death by misadventure. In November 2015 Hockney sold his house in Bridlington ending his connections with the town.

Next he moved to Normandy and now lives near the village of Beuvron-en-Auge. He holds a California Medical Marijuana Verification Card, which enables him to buy cannabis for medical purposes. He has used hearing aids since 1979, but realised he was going deaf long before then. As of 2018, he has been keeping fit by spending a half hour in the swimming pool every morning; he has been able to stand for six hours at the easel.

Hockney has synaesthetic associations between sound, colour and shape.

==Collections==

==Recognition==
In 1967, Hockney&#x27;s painting &quot;Peter Getting Out of Nick&#x27;s Pool&quot; won the John Moores Painting Prize at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. In 1983, the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Hockney its annual Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his life&#x27;s work. He was offered a knighthood in 1990 but declined it, before accepting an Order of Merit in January 2012. He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Progress medal in 1988 and the Special 150th Anniversary Medal and Honorary Fellowship in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography in 2003. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1997 and awarded The Cultural Award from the German Society for Photography (DGPh). He is a Royal Academician. 

In 2012, he was appointed to the Order of Merit, an honour restricted to 24 members at any one time for their contributions to the arts and sciences. He was a Distinguished Honoree of the National Arts Association, Los Angeles, in 1991 and received the First Annual Award of Achievement from the Archives of American Art, Los Angeles, in 1993. He was appointed to the board of trustees of the American Associates of the Royal Academy Trust, New York in 1992 and was given a Foreign Honorary Membership to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1997. In 2003, Hockney was awarded the Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici Lifetime Career Award of the Florence Biennale, Italy. Commissioned by The Other Art Fair, a November 2011 poll of 1,000 British painters and sculptors declared him Britain&#x27;s most influential artist of all time. In 2012, Hockney was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.

He is an honorary member of the Printmakers Council.

==Art market==
On 21 June 2006, Hockney&#x27;s painting &quot;The Splash&quot; sold for £2.6 million. It was offered for auction again on 11 February 2020, with an estimate of £20–30 million and sold, to an unknown buyer, for £23.1 million.

His &quot;A Bigger Grand Canyon&quot;, a series of 60 canvases that combined to produce one enormous picture, was bought by the National Gallery of Australia for $4.6 million.

&quot;Beverly Hills Housewife&quot; (1966–67), a 12-foot-long acrylic that depicts the collector Betty Freeman standing by her pool in a long hot-pink dress, sold for $7.9 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York in 2008, the top lot of the sale and a record price for a Hockney. This was topped in 2016 when his &quot;Woldgate Woods&quot; landscape made £9.4 million at auction. The record was broken again in 2018 with the sale of &quot;Piscine de Medianoche&quot; (&quot;Paper Pool 30)&quot; for $11.74 million and then doubled in the same Sotheby&#x27;s auction when &quot;Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica&quot; sold for $28.5 million.

On 15 November 2018, David Hockney&#x27;s 1972 painting &quot;Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)&quot; sold at Christie&#x27;s for $90.3 million with fees, surpassing the previous auction record for a living artist of $58.4 million, held by Jeff Koons for one of his &quot;Balloon Dog&quot; sculptures. He had originally sold this painting for $20,000 in 1972.

In recent years, David Hockney&#x27;s iPad drawings have become the most successful segment of his print market. Since the initial release of the Arrival of Spring in Woldgate series, prices have increased from roughly £19,000 in 2014 up to the current auction record of £340,200 in 2022.

==The Hockney–Falco thesis==

In the 2001 television programme and book &quot;Secret Knowledge&quot;, Hockney posited that the Old Masters used &quot;camera obscura&quot; as well as &quot;camera lucida&quot; and lens techniques that projected the image of the subject onto the surface of the painting. Hockney argues that this technique migrated gradually from Northern Europe to Italy, and is the reason for the photographic style of painting seen in the Renaissance and later periods of art. He published his conclusions in the 2001 book &quot;Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters&quot;, which was revised in 2006.

==Public life==
Like his father, Hockney was a conscientious objector and worked as a medical orderly in hospitals during his National Service, 1957–1959. David Hockney was a founder of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 1979. He was on the advisory board of the political magazine &quot;Standpoint;&quot; he contributed original sketches for its launch edition in June 2008, as well as agreeing to allow &quot;Standpoint&quot; to publish his previous views and pictures over the years.

He is a staunch pro-tobacco campaigner. In 2005 he fought to stop the ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants. At the Labour Party conference he held up a card saying &quot;DEATH awaits you all even if you do smoke&quot;. He was invited to guest-edit BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme on 29 December 2009 in which he aired his views on the subject. In 2013 he wrote a foreword and provided illustrations for a book by John Staddon, &quot;Unlucky Strike&quot;.

In October 2010, he and a hundred other artists signed an open letter to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt, protesting against cutbacks in the arts.

==In popular culture==
In 1966, while working on a series of etchings based on love poems by the Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy, Hockney starred in a documentary by filmmaker James Scott, entitled &quot;Love&#x27;s Presentation&quot;. He was the subject of Jack Hazan&#x27;s 1974 biopic, &quot;A Bigger Splash&quot;, named after Hockney&#x27;s 1967 pool painting of the same name. Hockney was also the inspiration of artist Billy Pappas in the documentary film &quot;Waiting for Hockney&quot; (2008), which debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2008.

Hockney was inducted into &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s International Best-Dressed Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2005, Burberry creative director Christopher Bailey centred his entire spring/summer menswear collection around the artist and in 2012, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, a close friend, named a checked jacket after Hockney. In 2011, British &quot;GQ&quot; named him one of the 50 Most Stylish Men in Britain and in March 2013, he was listed as one of the Fifty Best-dressed Over-50s by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Hockney was commissioned to design the cover and pages for the December 1985 issue of the French edition of &quot;Vogue&quot;. Consistent with his interest in cubism and admiration for Pablo Picasso, Hockney chose to paint Celia Birtwell (who appears in several of his works) from different views for the cover, as if the eye had scanned her face diagonally. &quot;David Hockney: A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (2012) is a biography of Hockney covering the years 1937–1975, by writer/photographer Christopher Simon Sykes.

In 2012, Hockney featured in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s list of &quot;The New Elizabethans&quot; to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named Hockney among the group of people in the UK &quot;whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character&quot;. The 2015 Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s film &quot;A Bigger Splash&quot; was named after Hockney&#x27;s painting. In 2022, he was portrayed by Laurence Fuller in the 7th episode of the 1st season of &quot;Minx&quot;.

In &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, a caricature of &quot;Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)&quot; hangs on the wall of the title character&#x27;s home office. In this version, horses replace the two human figures of the original.

==David Hockney Foundation==
The David Hockney Foundation — both the UK registered charity 1127262 and the US 501(c)(3) private operating foundation — was created by the artist in 2008. In 2012, Hockney, worth an estimated $55.2 million (approx. £36.1 m), transferred paintings valued at $124.2 million (approx. £81.5 m) to the David Hockney Foundation, and gave an additional $1.2 million (approx. £0.79 m) in cash to help fund the foundation&#x27;s operations.

The foundation&#x27;s mission is to advance appreciation and understanding of visual art and culture through the exhibition, preservation, and publication of David Hockney&#x27;s work. Richard Benefield, who organised &quot;David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition&quot; in 2013–2014 at the de Young Museum in San Francisco, became the first executive director in January 2017.

The foundation owns over 8,000 works – paintings, drawings, watercolours, complete editioned prints, stage design, multi-camera movies, and other media. They also hold 203 sketchbooks and Hockney&#x27;s personal photo albums from 1961 to 1990. The foundation manages various loans to museums and exhibitions around the world, including &quot;Happy Birthday, Mr. Hockney!&quot; at the Getty celebrating his 80th birthday, and the retrospective exhibitions of 2017–2018 at the Metropolitan Museum, Centre Georges Pompidou, and Tate Britain.

In October 2016 Taschen published &quot;David Hockney: A Bigger Book&quot;, costing £1,750 (£3,500 with an added loose print). The artist curated the selection of more than 60 years of his work reproduced within 498 pages. The book, weighing 78 lbs, had gone through 19 proof stages. The book came with an (optional) substantial wooden lectern. He unveiled the book at the Frankfurt Book Fair where he was the keynote speaker at the opening press conference.

<text>Daniel-François-Esprit Auber (; 29 January 178212 May 1871) was a French composer and director of the Paris Conservatoire.

Born into an artistic family, Auber was at first an amateur composer before he took up writing operas professionally when the family&#x27;s fortunes failed in 1820. He soon established a professional partnership with the librettist Eugène Scribe that lasted for 41 years and produced 39 operas, most of them commercial and critical successes. He is mostly associated with opéra-comique and composed 35 works in that genre. With Scribe he wrote the first French grand opera, &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot; (The Dumb Woman of Portici) in 1828, which paved the way for the large-scale works of Giacomo Meyerbeer.

Auber held two important official musical posts. From 1842 to 1871 he was director of France&#x27;s premier music academy, the Paris Conservatoire, which he expanded and modernised. From 1852 until the fall of the Second Empire in 1870 he was director of the imperial chapel in the Louvre, for which he wrote a substantial number of liturgical works and other religious music.

A devotee of Paris, Auber refused to leave the city when the Franco Prussian War led to the siege of Paris and the subsequent rise of the Paris Commune. He died in his house in Paris, aged 89, shortly before the French government regained control of the capital.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Auber was born on 29 January 1782 in Caen in Normandy, where his mother was visiting. The family was of Norman extraction but was based in Paris. Auber&#x27;s grandfather had been &quot;peintre du Roi&quot; – the king&#x27;s painter – responsible for sculpting and gilding the royal coaches, and Auber&#x27;s father, Jean-Baptiste Daniel, was an officer of the royal hunt, based at the &quot;petites écuries du Roi&quot; – the king&#x27;s small stables – in the Faubourg Saint-Denis in Paris. He and his wife, Françoise Adelaïde Esprit, &quot;née&quot; Vincent, had three sons and a daughter. When Auber was seven the French Revolution began, and his father had to find another occupation to allow him to go on providing for his family. He set up as a publisher, and opened a print shop in the rue Saint-Lazare, where he survived the Reign of Terror and prospered under the Directory and the Consulate. He had a salon, attended by artists of all kinds, where the young Auber sometimes performed: he was, by his teens, an accomplished violinist, pianist and singer.

Although his father encouraged his musical talent, Auber expected to go into the family&#x27;s print-selling business, and after the Treaty of Amiens (1802) ended the war between France and Britain he went to London to study commerce and learn English. In &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Charles Schneider writes that Auber evidently had some success in London as a performer and as a composer. An earlier biographer, Charles Malherbe, writes that although Auber did not gain any great insight into trade and finance during his sixteen months in London, he admired and emulated British reserve and understatement, which suited his own innate modesty. His shyness became well known. He never appeared before the public as a conductor, and throughout his career he was too nervous to attend his own first nights. He never married.

===Return to Paris===
In 1803 the fragile peace between France and Britain ended; the Napoleonic Wars began, and Auber left London for Paris, where he remained for the rest of his life. There, he was admitted to the Société académique des Enfants d&#x27;Apollon, a prestigious association of musicians and music-loving painters, of which his father had been a member since 1784. Among Auber&#x27;s compositions from this period were five cello concertos premiered by the soloist Lamare, in whose name at least three of them were originally published, although their real authorship soon emerged. The praise given to Auber&#x27;s violin concerto (1808) encouraged him to undertake a new setting of an old comic opera, &quot;Julie&quot;, for an amateur society in 1811. The orchestra consisted of two violins, two violas, cello, and double-bass, but Auber made effective use of the small forces, and the piece was well received. Luigi Cherubini, the dominant figure in Parisian operatic circles, was in the audience, and recognising the powerful though untrained talent of the young composer, he took him as a private pupil.

Accounts differ about Auber&#x27;s first professionally-staged opera, &quot;Le Séjour militaire&quot; (1813). Some older sources state that it had an &quot;unfavourable reception&quot;, and was &quot;a failure&quot;. Schneider (2001) writes that it had &quot;a satisfactory 16 performances, and was revived in 1826 and staged in the provinces&quot;. Schneider adds that for the next seven years, Auber lived a carefree life, until a sharp decline in the Aubers&#x27; financial circumstances and the death of his father in 1820 obliged him to secure an income to support the family. He devoted himself to composition, particularly of operas. &quot;La bergère châtelaine&quot; (1820) and &quot;Emma&quot; (1821), to librettos by Eugène de Planard, did well both in France and in Germany.

===Operatic success===
In 1822 Auber began a collaboration with the librettist Eugène Scribe that lasted for 41 years and produced 39 operas. Auber&#x27;s biographer Robert Letellier writes that the names of Scribe and Auber became as linked in French minds as those of Gilbert and Sullivan later were in British ones. The partners&#x27; first collaboration was &quot;Leicester, ou Le château de Kenilworth&quot;, a three-act opéra comique, with a plot derived by Scribe, in collaboration with Mélesville, from Walter Scott&#x27;s historical romance &quot;Kenilworth&quot;. It was given by the Opéra-Comique company at the Salle Feydeau in January 1823 with Antoine Ponchard and Antoinette Lemonnier in the leading roles, and received 60 performances over the next five seasons. Schneider writes of the collaboration:

During the rest of the 1820s Auber&#x27;s collaborations with Scribe were mostly successful, with long runs by the standards of the day. By contrast, his only opera without Scribe from this period ran for seven performances. By 1825 Auber was eminent enough in his profession to be made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the government of Charles X.

Although most of Auber&#x27;s operas from this period were in the established genre of opéra comique – works with spoken dialogue, usually in three acts – in 1825 he wrote the first French grand opera, &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot;, a five-act piece, with extensive ballet numbers, and recitative instead of spoken dialogue. The original libretto was by Germain Delavigne, adapted and revised by Scribe. After the premiere at the Paris Opéra in February 1828, productions opened in London in May 1829 and New York in November of the same year. By 1882 the piece had been given more than 500 times in Paris, and was performed in translated versions throughout Europe. A spectacular ballet, &quot;Masaniello&quot;, with the same story, using Auber&#x27;s music, was popular in London in the later 1820s. Schneider writes that Auber consolidated his international reputation with &quot;La Fiancée&quot; (1829) and &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; (1830), both with Scribe.

===Institut and Conservatoire===

In 1829 Auber was elected as one of the six members of the Académie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut de France in succession to François-Joseph Gossec, joining the joint doyens, Cherubini and Jean-François Le Sueur, and their colleagues Henri Berton, François-Adrien Boieldieu and Charles Catel. During his 42 years as a member he was joined by composers including Adolphe Adam, Hector Berlioz, Charles Gounod and Ambroise Thomas. Under the government of King Louis-Philippe, Auber was appointed director of court concerts in 1839, and, when Cherubini retired in 1842, director of the Conservatoire. Schneider writes that in the latter post Auber&#x27;s term of office was marked by:

In the 1830s Auber wrote twelve operas with Scribe, half of them opéras comiques, and half more serious works for the Opéra: &quot;Le Dieu et la bayadère&quot; (1830), &quot;Le Philtre&quot; (1831), &quot;Le Serment ou les Faux monnayeurs&quot; (1832), &quot;Gustave III ou le Bal masqué&quot; (1833), &quot;Le Cheval de bronze&quot; (1835) and &quot;Le Lac des fées&quot; (1839).

===Later years===
Auber was a much-loved and conscientious director of the Conservatoire; he ran a less conservative regime than his predecessor, and introduced changes such as permitting applause at Conservatoire concerts, and giving members of the faculty more freedom in what they taught their students. He enlarged the composition, piano and orchestral instrument departments. His customary modesty extended to banning any of his works from being performed at the Conservatoire during the whole of his directorship. Several winners of the Prix de Rome – France&#x27;s premier music prize – trained under him, including Georges Bizet, 
Ernest Guiraud, Théodore Dubois and Jules Massenet.

Auber&#x27;s productivity as an opera composer slowed somewhat in the years after his appointment to the Conservatoire, but he completed 13 new operas between 1843 and 1869, including &quot;La part du diable&quot; (The Devil&#x27;s Share, 1943), &quot;Haydée, ou Le secret&quot; (1847), &quot;L&#x27;enfant prodigue&quot; (The Prodigal Son. 1850), &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; (1856 – 28 years before Massenet&#x27;s version and 37 years before Puccini&#x27;s), and his last collaboration with Scribe, &quot;La Circassienne&quot; (The Circassian Woman, 1861). After Scribe&#x27;s death in 1861, Auber composed only two more operas, both with librettos by Adolphe d&#x27;Ennery and Eugène Cormon: &quot;Le premier jour de bonheur&quot; (The First Day of Happiness, 1868) and &quot;Rêve d&#x27;amour&quot; (Dream of Love, 1869).

&quot;Le premier jour de bonheur&quot; was a considerable success, and reviewers remarked on the freshness of the octogenarian composer&#x27;s score: &quot;Its music is, for the greater part, as fresh and sparkling as the best gems of &quot;Masaniello&quot; or &quot;The Crown Diamonds&quot;&quot;. It was an exceptional box-office success, given 167 times in Paris over the next few seasons and staged in Vienna, Berlin, Budapest and other European cities.

Under the Second Empire Auber was appointed director of the chapelle impériale by Napoleon III in 1852, and composed a considerable amount of music for the emperor&#x27;s chapel in the Louvre. The musical forces there were substantial, the choir and orchestra comprising 40 musicians each. They performed under the direction of conductors from the Opéra, rather than the composer.

By the time of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Auber was old and ailing. He refused to leave Paris, and remained there during the siege of Paris and the subsequent rise of the Paris Commune. He resigned as director of the Conservatoire so that the building could be used as a hospital. He was briefly succeeded as director by Francisco Salvador-Daniel – appointed by the Communards and shot by the French government eleven days later – and more permanently by Ambroise Thomas, who held the post from 1871 to 1896.

Auber&#x27;s health deteriorated and in May 1871 he took to his bed. Two friends – Thomas and his fellow composer Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin – took turns watching over him. In the early hours of 12 May he died at his house in the Rue Saint-Georges, aged 89. He was buried at the Père Lachaise cemetery.

==Music==

===Opera===

The total number of operas or other stage works by Auber given by various sources differs slightly, depending on whether collaborations with other composers are included. &quot;Grove&quot; gives the total as 51, beginning with &quot;Julie&quot; in 1805 and ending with &quot;Rêve d&#x27;amour&quot; in 1869. Of these, 35 are opéras-comiques, with spoken dialogue. The genre includes some serious or even tragic plots, and some of Auber&#x27;s such as &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; are far from comic, but the majority of his opéras comiques are lighthearted.

The musicologist Hugh Macdonald writes of Auber, &quot;With Adolphe Adam, he took on the mantle of Adrien Boieldieu and Ferdinand Hérold, and passed it on in turn to Ambroise Thomas and Jacques Offenbach&quot;. Macdonald judges the finest of the Auber-Scribe collaborations to be &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot;, &quot;a grand opera that served as a model for the Meyerbeerian genre&quot;. He comments that despite the success of that work, Auber rarely essayed serious opera thereafter, confining himself in general to lighter operatic forms. The same writer concludes:
Macdonald considers &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; the most successful of Auber&#x27;s opéras-comiques: &quot;the music has a lively spring, with Auber&#x27;s abundant melodic gift always in evidence&quot;. He adds that although the influence of Rossini is detectable, there are also chromatic touches that anticipate Smetana, who was composing 30 years after Auber. Letellier comments on Auber&#x27;s sensitivity to the French language &quot;celebrating with wit and piquancy the natural inflections and nuances of the text that Scribe could so effortlessly provide&quot;. In his later works, beginning with &quot;La Part du diable&quot; (1843), Auber developed a more lyrical manner and became less conservative harmonically. Letellier writes that within the confines of the opèra-comique genre Auber &quot;deepened the scope of dramatic expressiveness&quot;.

The composer&#x27;s operatic music is noted for the brilliance of coloratura passages for chorus as well as soloists, and the quantity of ensemble writing, particularly in the finales to acts. Letellier lists the vocal genres the Auber introduced into his scores: the ballad, the barcarolle, the bolero, the canon, the Bourbonnaise (laughing song), the chanson, the couplet, the galop, the nocturne, the round, the Tyrolienne and the waltz song. Auber&#x27;s orchestration, which reflects the influence of his friend Rossini, became the model for French operatic compositions throughout the 19th century, including those of Bizet and Massenet. In the opéras-comiques Auber&#x27;s orchestra generally consists of piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets or cornets à pistons, trombones, timpani, snare drum, triangle, bass drum, cymbals, harp and strings.

===Church music===
Although Auber was and is best known for his operas, he wrote a substantial quantity of religious music, beginning with a Messe solennelle, for three solo voices and orchestra in 1812. Among his better-known religious pieces is a Dona nobis pacem (1828) which the composer reused in &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot;. Most of his liturgical pieces were written after his appointment as director of the chapelle impériale in 1852. The biographer Charles Malherbe notes that Auber&#x27;s most productive years for religious music were 1854, 1858, 1859. 1860, 1863 and 1865 – years in which he composed no operas. Church works for the imperial chapel include a Pie Jesu, a Stabat Mater and numerous settings of sections of the Mass, including Kyries, Glorias, Benedictuses and Agnus Deis. Other religious works include 12 settings of O salutaris hostia, written between 1854 and 1870.

Most of the pieces Auber wrote for the imperial chapel are, in Schneider&#x27;s words, &quot;plain in style, homophonic and melody-led&quot;. Few have been published, but most survive in manuscript, often in two versions: one with orchestral accompaniment, and one with organ.

===Other music===
From the 1790s, Auber composed chamber and orchestral works, including a piano sonata, two string quartets, a piano trio, a piano quartet, a violin concerto, the five cello concertos written for Jacques-Michel Hurel de Lamare, and variations on a theme by Handel.

In addition to his liturgical music, Auber wrote a substantial number of secular choral or other vocal works, including cantatas to commemorate the wedding of Napoleon III and other events of imperial or national importance.

<doc id="238346" wikidata="Q2163931" url="?curid=238346" title="Tarring and feathering">
<text>Tarring and feathering is a form of public torture where a victim is stripped naked, or stripped to the waist, while wood tar (sometimes hot) is either poured or painted onto the person. The victim then either has feathers thrown on them or is rolled around on a pile of feathers so that they stick to the tar.

Used to enforce unofficial justice or revenge, it was used in medieval Europe and its colonies in the early modern period, as well as the early American frontier, mostly as a form of vigilante justice.

The image of a tarred-and-feathered outlaw remains a metaphor for severe public criticism.

Tarring and feathering was a very common punishment in British colonies in North America during 1766 through 1776. The most famous American tarring and feathering is that of John Malcolm, a British Loyalist, during the American Revolution.

==Early history==
The earliest mention of the punishment appears in orders that Richard I of England issued to his navy on starting for the Holy Land in 1189. &quot;Concerning the lawes and ordinances appointed by King Richard for his navie the forme thereof was this ... item, a thiefe or felon that hath stolen, being lawfully convicted, shal have his head shorne, and boyling pitch poured upon his head, and feathers or downe strawed upon the same whereby he may be knowen, and so at the first landing-place they shall come to, there to be cast up&quot; (transcript of original statute in &quot;Hakluyt&#x27;s Voyages&quot;, ii. 21).

A later instance of this penalty appears in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; (series 4, vol. v), which quotes James Howell writing in Madrid in 1623 of the &quot;boisterous Bishop of Halberstadt, a German Protestant military leader ... having taken a place where there were two monasteries of nuns and friars, he caused divers feather beds to be ripped, and all the feathers thrown into a great hall, whither the nuns and friars were thrust naked with their bodies oiled and pitched and to tumble among these feathers, which makes them here (Madrid) presage him an ill-death.&quot; (The Bishop was apparently Christian the Younger of Brunswick.)

In 1696, a London bailiff attempted to serve process on a debtor who had taken refuge within the precincts of the Savoy. The bailiff was tarred and feathered and taken in a wheelbarrow to the Strand, where he was tied to a maypole that stood by what is now Somerset House as an improvised pillory.

== 18th-century North America ==
The practice of tarring and feathering was exported to the Americas, gaining popularity in the mid-18th century. Throughout the 1760s it saw increased use as a means of protesting the Townshend Revenue Act and those who sought to enforce it. After a period of few tarrings and featherings between 1770 and 1773, the passage of the Tea Act in May 1773 led to a resurgence of incidents.

During the Stamp Act 1765 crisis, Archibald McCall, a wealthy Loyalist landowner, was targeted by a Patriot mob in Westmoreland and Essex County, Virginia. He insisted on collecting the British tax that was placed on stamps and other documents. In reaction, a mob formed and stormed his house in Tappahannock, Virginia. They threw rocks through the windows, and McCall was captured, tarred and feathered. In 1766, Captain J. William Smith was tarred, feathered, and dumped into the harbor of Norfolk, Virginia, by a mob that included the town&#x27;s mayor. A vessel picked him out of the water just as his strength was giving out. He survived and was later quoted in a letter as saying that they &quot;be-dawbed my body and face all over with tar and afterwards threw feathers on me.&quot; Smith was suspected of informing on smugglers to the British customs agents, as was the case with most other tar-and-feathers victims in the following decade.

The practice appeared in Salem, Massachusetts in 1768, when mobs attacked low-level employees of the customs service with tar and feathers. In October 1769, a mob in Boston attacked a customs service sailor the same way, and a few similar attacks followed through 1774. Customs Commissioner John Malcolm was tarred and feathered on two occasions. First, in November 1773, he was targeted by sailors in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, before undergoing a similar, albeit arguably more violent, ordeal in Boston in January 1774. Malcolm was stripped, tarred, feathered, beaten, and whipped for several hours. He was then taken to the Liberty Tree and forced to drink tea until he vomited.

In February 1775, Abner Bebee, a Loyalist of East Haddam, Connecticut, was tarred and feathered before being taken to a hog sty and covered in dung. Hog dung was then smeared in his eyes and forced down his throat. Bebee was subjected to this as a perceived punishment for expressing pro-British sentiment by his local Committee of Safety.

A particularly violent act of tarring and feathering took place in August 1775 northeast of Augusta, Georgia. Landowner and loyalist Thomas Brown was confronted on his property by members of the Sons of Liberty. After putting up some resistance, Brown was beaten with a rifle, fracturing his skull. He was then stripped and tied to a tree. Hot pitch was poured over him before being set alight, charring two of his toes to stubs. Brown was then feathered by the Sons of Liberty, who then took a knife to his head and began scalping him.

Such acts associated the punishment with the Patriot side of the American Revolution. An exception occurred in March 1775, when a number of soldiers from the 47th Regiment of Foot tarred and feathered Thomas Ditson, a colonist from Billerica, Massachusetts, who attempted to illegally purchase a musket from one of the regiment&#x27;s soldiers. Ditson was tarred and feathered before having a placard reading &quot;American Liberty: A Speciment of Democracy&quot; hung around his neck whilst regimental musicians played &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;.

During the Whiskey Rebellion, local farmers inflicted the punishment on federal tax agents. Beginning on September 11, 1791, western Pennsylvania farmers rebelled against the federal government&#x27;s taxation on western Pennsylvania whiskey distillers. Their first victim was reportedly a recently appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson. He was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. Other officials who attempted to serve court warrants on Johnson&#x27;s attackers were whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because of these and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution.

There is no known case of a person dying from being tarred and feathered during this period.

== 19th century ==
In 1851, Thomas Paul Smith, a 24-year-old African-American from Boston, outspoken in his opposition to school desegregation, was tarred and feathered by a group of African-American Bostonians opposed to segregation.

Also in 1851, a Know-Nothing mob in Ellsworth, Maine, tarred and feathered Swiss-born Jesuit priest, Father John Bapst, in the midst of a local controversy over religious education in grammar schools. Bapst fled Ellsworth to settle in nearby Bangor, Maine, where there was a large Irish-Catholic community, and a local high school there is named for him.

In 1872, schoolteacher Charles G. Kelsey was tarred and feathered for pursuing a teenage girl from a wealthy family. He was murdered shortly after in mysterious circumstances. His assailants were acquitted of riot and assault and never brought to trial for murder.

== 20th century ==

The November 27, 1906, edition of the &quot;Evening News&quot; of Ada, Oklahoma, reports that a vigilance committee consisting of four young married women from East Sandy, Pennsylvania, corrected the alleged evil conduct of their neighbor, Mrs. Hattie Lowry, in whitecap style. One of the women was a sister-in-law of the victim. The women appeared at Mrs. Lowry&#x27;s home in open day and announced that she had not heeded the spokeswoman and leader. Two women held Mrs. Lowry to the floor while the other two smeared her face with stove polish until it was completely covered. They then poured thick molasses upon her head and emptied the contents of a feather pillow over the molasses. The women then marched the victim to a railroad camp, tied by the wrists, where two hundred workmen stopped work to watch the spectacle. After parading Mrs. Lowry through the camp, the women tied her to a large box where she remained until a man released her. Three of the women involved were arrested, pleaded guilty and each paid a $10.00 fine.

In 1912, the American anarchist Ben Reitman was &quot;tarred and sagebrushed&quot; by vigilantes in the aftermath of the San Diego free speech fight. Sagebrush was used because feathers were not available.

There were several examples of tarring and feathering of African Americans in the lead-up to World War I in Vicksburg, Mississippi. According to William Harris, this was a relatively rare form of mob punishment to Republican African-Americans in the post-bellum U.S. South, as its goal was typically pain and humiliation rather than death.

During World War I, anti-German sentiment was widespread in the United States and many German-Americans were attacked. For example, in August 1918 a German-American farmer, John Meints of Luverne, Minnesota, was captured by a group of men, taken to the nearby South Dakota border and tarred and feathered—for allegedly not supporting war bonds. Meints sued his assailants and lost, but on appeal to a federal court he won, and in 1922 settled out of court for $6,000. In March 1922, a German-born Catholic priest in Slaton, Texas, Joseph M. Keller, who had been harassed by local residents during World War I due to his ethnicity, was accused of breaking the seal of confession and tarred and feathered. Thereafter Keller served a Catholic parish in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Future Australian senator Fred Katz – a socialist and anti-conscriptionist of German parentage – was publicly tarred and feathered outside his office in Melbourne in December 1915. A week before the 1919 Australian federal election, former Labor MP John McDougall was kidnapped by a group of about 20 ex-soldiers in Ararat, Victoria, and subsequently tarred and feathered before being dumped in the town&#x27;s streets. He had earlier been revealed as the author of an anti-war poem that was perceived as insulting Australia&#x27;s soldiers. Six men were charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm, but pleaded down to common assault and were fined £5 each. Many newspapers supported their actions.

A group of black-robed Knights of Liberty (a faction of the KKK) tarred and feathered seventeen members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in Oklahoma in 1917, during an incident known as the Tulsa Outrage. They claimed responsibility for a number of other tarring and feathering incidents over the next year in Oklahoma, the Midwest, and California. In the 1920s, vigilantes were opposed to IWW organizers at California&#x27;s harbor of San Pedro. They kidnapped at least one organizer, subjected him to tarring and feathering, and left him in a remote location.

The edition of the &quot;Miami Daily News-Record&quot; (Miami, Oklahoma) for Wednesday, May 28, 1930, contains on its front page the arrests of five brothers (Isaac, Newton, Henry, Gordon and Charles Starns) from Louisiana accused of tarring and feathering S. L. Newsome, who was a prominent dentist. This was in retaliation for the dentist having an affair with one of the brother&#x27;s wives.

Similar tactics were also used by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the early years of the Troubles. Many of the victims were women accused of being in romantic relationships with policemen or British soldiers.

Robert E. Miles received a 4-year sentence for the tarring and feathering of a school official.

== 21st century ==
In August 2007, loyalist groups in Northern Ireland were linked to the tarring and feathering of an individual accused of drug-dealing.

In June 2020, multiple graves and memorials to Confederate soldiers at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana, were tarred and feathered.

== In popular culture ==
Tarring and feathering has been commonly referenced in historic and contemporary popular culture, particularly in the United States.

===Literature===
The use of tar and pitch in punishments appearing in such medieval works as Anglo-Norman sermons, &quot;The Purgatory of Saint Patrick&quot; by Marie de France and Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; have been seen as precursors for the idea of tarring and feathering. The latter also features the element of feathers when a &quot;human thief is painfully transformed into a grotesque simulacrum of nature&#x27;s thief, the magpie&quot;.

====North America====
The punitive social ritual of tarring and feathering has appeared in numerous American works of both &quot;canonical literature and dime novels&quot;, even as the actual practice became less frequent, &quot;dramatizing debates between summary punishment on the one hand, and individual rights on the other&quot;. This outward blackening by tar was generally equated with blackness of character, which again was linked to racist notions of the inferiority of black-skinned slaves, while the feathers were sometines regarded as &quot;nodding to [American-]Indian headdresses&quot;. &quot;John Trumbull, James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Edgar Allan Poe, among numerous others, draw on tarring and feathering to portray anxieties about the &quot;experiment&quot; of democracy in which egalitarian alignment of society yielded a racialized social opprobrium.&quot; The earliest representations in literature were in the context of the American Revolution, in a poem by Philip Freneau and in John Trumbull&#x27;s &quot;M&#x27;Fingal&quot; from 1776, which in its literary form of &quot;the mockepic genre [...] resonated with the euphemistic, tongue-in-cheek language used in newspapers&quot;. This background reappeared in Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;The Hornet&#x27;s Nest&quot;, which features a &quot;stunning&quot; scene with the tarring and feathering of loyalist Thomas Brown. The torture was presented as the pivotal event for the radicalization of that character.

James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Redskins&quot; from 1846 presented the act of tarring and feathering in the context of the Anti-Rent War as the &quot;unwarranted, imbalanced threat of violence from misguided, irrational, and selfinterested crowds&quot;. In the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, tarring and feathering appeared as problematic side-effect of democracy and nationalism in the United States of America of his time, progressing from a symbolic regicide in the American Revolution to fratricide. In &quot;My Kinsman, Major Molineux&quot; (1831), Robin, the nephew of the eponymous character, seeks him in vain throughout the story. Finally, Robin sees the Major taken by in a procession, tarred and feathered, having fallen out of the favour of his community. Here Hawthorne examined the effect this punishment has on the &quot;community after engaging in such a brutal act&quot;, while he used it as &quot;as a metaphor of persecution and victimization&quot; in &quot;Old News: The Old Tory&quot; (1837) and &quot;The Custom-House&quot;, the introduction to &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1850). In &quot;Doctor Grimshawe&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1882) Hawthorne puts both perspectives together &quot;as characters alternate between victims and perpetrators with each passing moment&quot;. In the stories &quot;The Liberty Tree&quot; and &quot;Tory&#x27;s Farewell&quot; from the collection &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Chair&quot; (1842), Hawthorne shows tarring and feathering as a sign of &quot;mob mentality that dismisses common sense&quot; and is unwarranted as a means of political and social dispute.

&quot;Dramatizations of the ritual in antebellum literature reveal the deep political and psychological anxieties about the use of violent social coercion to establish the always shifting class and racial boundaries of U.S. nationalism.&quot; Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s humorous short story, &quot;The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether&quot; (1845), featured the staff of an insane asylum being tarred and feathered as a means of torture. In his short story &quot;Hop-Frog; Or Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs&quot; (1849) appeared the &quot;image of the tarred and feathered body as ape&quot;, which &quot;for Poe, is the embodiment of white terror associated with the chaos of rioting and insurrection.&quot; Both stories are written against the background of the abolitionism debate, and the tarring and feathering is also seen as the outward sign of a &quot;power inversion&quot;, which can be related for Poe&#x27;s society both to the relationship of slave and master, as well as abolitionists and anti-abolitionists. Psychiatric history researcher Wendy Gonaver assumed that &quot;Tarr and Fether&quot; &quot;mocks the conceit that bourgeois liberalism can contain the violent madness of revolution&quot;. The story was very loosely adapted by The Alan Parsons Project into the song &quot;(The System of) Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether&quot; on the &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; album. A more racialized context, where tar is used to blacken the skin against abolitionists and sympathizers &quot;to correspond to the purported color of the slaves they were trying to free&quot; is prevalent in the atmosphere preceding the American Civil War. This was reflected in literary works like Harriet Beecher-Stowe&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot; from 1856 and &quot;Rose Mather&quot; (1868) by Mary Jane Holmes.

The &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1885) by Mark Twain &quot;perhaps more than any other literary work, immortalized the punishment&quot;: the King and the Duke are tarred, feathered, and ridden on a rail after performing the Royal Nonesuch to a crowd that Jim had warned about the rapscallions. Twain points out the dehumanizing effect of the ritual and &quot;that even those who deserve blame do not warrant punishment outside the law&quot;. In 1958 the social punishment appears as a humorous element in James Thurber&#x27;s modern fable &quot;What Happened To Charles&quot;: the duck Eva, who eavesdrops on every conversation she hears but never gets anything quite right, is ironically tarred and &quot;un&quot;-feathered, i.e. plucked, after she mistakes &quot;shod&quot; (having shoes put on) for &quot;shot&quot; and spreads the rumor that the horse Charles has been killed (he turns up alive and wearing new horseshoes). In Philip Roth&#x27;s 2004 alternate history novel &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;, the 8-year-old protagonist has a daydreaming fear of himself and his family being tarred and feathered. Here this &quot;antiquated punishment from Western mythology&quot; symbolizes the humiliation the Jewish family suffers in a climate of antisemitism. In Anne Cameron&#x27;s &quot;The Journey&quot; (1982) it is an example of misogyny in the American West.

Scholar of American literature Marina Trininc observed in 2013 that tarring and feathering has also appeared in recent American novels against the background of terroristic attacks in the US and worldwide.

====Europe====
Tarring and feathering in North America was reported and discussed in many British newspapers in the 1770s, often in an exaggerating manner, emphasizing different sensibilites between the two populations and denigrating North American attitudes, while a majority of American newspapers presented such acts in a sympathetic and euphemistic way. Charles Dickens satirized this tone of the latter in &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (1842–1844) in the figure of Mr. Chollop: This American was an &quot;advocate of Lynch law, and slavery; and invariably recommended, both in print and speech, the &quot;tarring and feathering&quot; of any unpopular person who differed from himself&quot; and &quot;was much esteemed for his devotion to rational Liberty&quot;.

In Northern Irish literature, &quot;[t]arring and feathering women who are accused of dating males of the other community (especially British soldiers) are a common &quot;topos&quot;&quot;. A graphic depiction of the practice occurs in Robert McLiam Wilson&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;Ripley Bogle&quot;, where in West Belfast a woman made pregnant by a corporal of the Royal Engineers is punished. Seamus Heaney&#x27;s 1975 poem &quot;Punishment&quot; juxtaposes the tarring and feathering of Catholic women who fraternized with British soldiers with the punishment of Iron Age bog body the Windeby Girl (since revealed to be a man) who was at the time thought to have been punished for infidelity, suggesting that the punishment meted to women in Northern Ireland is very much rooted in ancient tribal traditions. This connection has been criticized by scholar of English literature Richard Danson Brown as &quot;sloppy thinking&quot; which removes the modern punitive ritual from the political realm. In Eoin McNamee&#x27;s novel &quot;Resurrection Man&quot; (1994), both sides of the Northern Ireland conflict are shown employing these &quot;ritual punishments for consorting with the enemy&quot;, emphasizing the Troubles &quot;as a period of the destabilization of ethical norms&quot;.

In fairy tales tarring and feathering is only rarely found, but it appears in a number of droll stories (most prevalent in Northern and Eastern Europe) after the middle of the 19th century. The character types &quot;klutz at housework&quot;, &quot;dumb woman&quot;, and &quot;unwanted male suitor&quot; — all caricatures of human weaknesses — are ridiculed by tarring and feathering. Sometimes the function of tar and feathers is replaced by other substances like eggs and bran, or by being put into fool&#x27;s motley. In some stories tarred and feathered characters are misrepresented or mistaken for an unknown animal or the devil, and sometimes do not even recognize themselves. In a few cases tarring and feathering is done deliberately as part of a ruse.

===Comics===
The punishment of tarring and feathering in the American Old West has been &quot;forever more given to posterity in comics&quot;. It is used in ironic fashion in the comic series &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;, where a number of antagonists, usually cardsharps and swindlers, are shown tarred and feathered. In Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Terror of the Transvaal&quot; (1993), the sixth chapter of &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, syrup and feathers are used to punish a treacherous thief.
===Art===
In the 1770s, when tarring and feathering was perceived as a novelty and became increasingly frequent in British America, a number of prints showing this punishment were published in England. According to historian Barry Levy these pictures both catered to a sense of thrill, as well as anti-American sentiments. One mezzotint from 1775 also depicted women - &quot;probably seductively and fearfully pornographic,&quot; being tarred and feathered before any such a case was actually recorded. Marina Trininc remarked that English prints emphasized the feathers, as e.g. geese symbolized &quot;weak intellects and moral unnaturalness&quot;, while the &quot;racialized dimensions of this punishment&quot;, the association of the tar with black skin, &quot;were lost in translation across the shores&quot;.

The neo-expressionist painter Jean-Michel Basquiat exhibited the paintings &quot;Black Tar and Feathers&quot;, and &quot;Untitled (Yellow Tar and Feathers)&quot; in 1982, the later a painting that scholar Fred Hoffman interprets as containing &quot;young black heroic figures&quot; and speaking of &quot;a rising above the pain, suffering and degradation associated with the act of being &#x27;tarred and feathered&#x27;&quot;. In the view of art historian Leonard Emmering, the &quot;blackness of tar is [...] associated with Basquiat&#x27;s skin color&quot;, and his &quot;Tar and Feathers&quot; painting &quot;refers to the racist practice of tarring and feathering black men.&quot;

===On stage===
Tarring and feathering appeared in several English plays in the 1770s as a novel element used in &quot;a satirical and comedic context&quot;. The appearance of a victim of the punishment was also used as a costume in a masked ball and other public appearances of that time. Much later, in Meredith Willson&#x27;s musical &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1957), tarring and feathering is demanded as punishment of the main character Harold Hill, con man and Trickster figure, for his scam.

===Television and film===

Tarring and feathering has been depicted in television and film in different functions, for drastic effect, realistically, or in a humorous manner: In the 1972 John Waters &quot;trash cinema&quot; film &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, Connie and Raymond Marbles (played by Mink Stole and David Lochary), are tarred and feathered. Here this act of retribution for a series of misdeeds against the film&#x27;s protagonist, Babs Johnson (Divine), is one of the signs showing her &quot;defiance of feminine cultural norms&quot;. The episode &quot;Join or Die&quot; of 2008 HBO miniseries &quot;John Adams&quot; has Adams witnessing an angry Boston mob tarring and feathering a British tax officer. While effective as a &quot;chilling portrayal&quot; of the procedure, the situation around it is historically inaccurate. In &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot; episode 8 &quot;Blood Bath&quot; (2014), The Lizard Girl&#x27;s father is tarred and feathered in retaliation for his role in his daughter&#x27;s intentional disfigurement. This is presented as a both gruesome and satisfying act of retribution. In the film &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; (1984) characters Lewis Skolnick and Gilbert Lowe are tarred and feathered by the Alpha Betas in response to their attempt to seek admittance to the fraternity. Despite the overall funny tone of the movie, the scene connects to &quot;a public form of humiliation used throughout history&quot;, &quot;a sort of lynch mob mentality&quot; directed against the minority, here the eponymous nerds. In the episode &quot;The Gang Cracks the Liberty Bell&quot; (2008) of the television series &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia&quot;, Mac and Dennis, while dressed as British fops, are tarred and feathered by colonial Americans in light-hearted &quot;hilarious scenes&quot;.

A number of the depictions on screen refer to the era of the American Wild West, some in a mythologizing and some in a more realistic manner. In the film &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970), adapted from the 1964 novel by Thomas Berger, con man Meriweather, played by Martin Balsam, and title character Jack Crabbe, played by Dustin Hoffman, are shown being tarred and feathered for selling a phony medicinal elixir. The cruel procedure is used as a tragicomic element illustrating this &quot;revisionist retelling of the Wild West saga&quot;, as the leader of the perpetrating mob turns out to be Jack&#x27;s long lost sister. In Daniel Knauf&#x27;s &quot;Carnivàle&quot;, in an episode called &quot;Lincoln Highway&quot; (2005), Clayton &quot;Jonesy&quot; Jones, the crippled co-manager, is tarred and feathered almost lethally. The procedure here is presented as a deserved punishment for the accidental death of several children at the ferris wheel under Jonsey&#x27;s responsibility. While anachronistic for the 1930s setting, it is one of a number of references to the American frontier. Similarly, the 2012 film &quot;Lawless,&quot; set in the 1930s has been considered a &quot;Western-gangster film hybrid&quot;. A bootlegger being tarred and feathered was one of the violent images that shaped the impression that the film made. In an episode of the &quot;Deadwood&quot; TV series, African-American character Samuel Fields is tarred and feathered in a racist &quot;eruption of mob violence that acts to express and purge the anger of the town&#x27;s whites&quot; in scenes clearly depicting the horror of the procedure. The season 1 episode &quot;God of Chaos&quot; (2011) one of the AMC TV series &quot;Hell on Wheels,&quot; a character, The Swede, is depicted being tarred and feathered before getting run out of town.

In animation, tarring and feathering has been used for comic effect with no serious or lasting impact on the characters. In the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote short film, &quot;Guided Muscle&quot; (1955), Coyote tries to apply a tar-and-feather machine to Road Runner, who already has feathers. As usual in these cartoons, Coyote becomes the victim of his backfiring plan, but is humiliated rather than seriously harmed by the procedure. In the TV series &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; characters are tarred and feathered in several episodes as dark humour. For Bart Simpson as a perpetrator, Divya Carolyn McMillin cited the procedure as an example of a character who &quot;was unapologetic and acted on impulse&quot;, making him appealing to youths, which was possible in animation, in contrast to real life, as no consequences for Bart were shown.

Marina Trininc observed in 2013 that tarring and feathering has appeared in recent American films and series against the backdrop of terroristic attacks in the US and worldwide.

===Video games===
In the video game &quot;Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, Guybrush Threepwood is tarred and feathered by monkey crew members of a pirate ship, treating the procedure in a less-than-serious manner. He later uses this to pose as El Pollo Diablo, a giant chicken who has terrorized the area.

===Music===
Tarring and feathering appeared as a topic in music already in the 18th century: A verse from an early (British) version of &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; relates to an incident involving a &quot;Yankee&quot; Minuteman named Thomas Ditson of Billerica, Massachusetts:
::Yankee Doodle came to town,
::For to buy a firelock,
::We will tar and feather him,
::And so we will John Hancock.

More recently it has been used in the title of several works: The second track of the cult British Indie band Cardiacs 1987 Mini LP &quot;Big Ship&quot; was titled &quot;Tarred and Feathered&quot;. The music video for this song was infamously played on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Tube&quot;, and was remarked for the song&#x27;s unusual nature and the band&#x27;s unusual visual appeal. The 2010 EP from The Hives is called &quot;Tarred and Feathered&quot;. The 2005 album &quot;Gutter Phenomenon&quot; by metal band Every Time I Die contains an &quot;explosive&quot; song punningly titled &quot;Guitarred and Feathered&quot;.

Tarring and feathering is featured within the lyrics of songs such as in the Merle Haggard hit &quot;(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers&quot; (1964). In lyrics by Liz Anderson, there is a line saying &quot;he &quot;should be taken out, tarred and feathered&quot; for his foolishness&quot; of trusting the woman who would betray and leave him. Haggard&#x27;s biographer David Cantwell found that the performance influenced how this image was perceived: In a version by Roy Drusky it comes off &quot;as self-effacing&quot;, but when &quot;Haggard sings the line, it&#x27;s as if he&#x27;s identifying exactly the punishment he deserves.&quot; To be tarred and feathered is mentioned in the chorus of the song &quot;To Kingdom Come&quot;, from The Band&#x27;s album &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; (1968), as one of the fates to be feared. The 1996 R.E.M. song &quot;Be Mine&quot; contains the lyric &quot;I&#x27;ll ply the tar out of your feathers,&quot; purportedly a reference to tarring and feathering. In satirist Tom Lehrer&#x27;s album &quot;An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer&quot; (1959), his introduction to the song &quot;We Will All Go Together When We Go&quot; mentions an acquaintance of his who was &quot;financially independent having inherited his father&#x27;s tar-and-feather business&quot;.

Depicting artists being tarred and feathered has also been used as a means of promoting music: The avant-garde electronic music artist Fad Gadget (Frank Tovey) often performed on stage while tarred and feathered. He was photographed in tar and feathers for the cover of his album &quot;Gag&quot; (1984). Artist Martynka Wawrzyniak described the function of this device as allowing &quot;you to step outside of your comfort zone and do something different&quot;. Tovey himself &quot;interpreted the shock value of his presentations as &#x27;commercial suicide&#x27;&quot; as they were &quot;challenging, or degrading to the pop star ideal&quot;. Popular music scholar Giuseppe Zevolli saw this as the artist &quot;exploring the link between his role as a performer and the power of media to influence their audiences.&quot; The Hives band members were likewise depicted on the album cover of &quot;Tarred and Feathered&quot;, presented in newspaper style, and subtitled &quot;Cheating with other people&#x27;s songs!&quot;, as the EP contained only songs covered from other artists.

===Metaphorical uses===
The image of the tarred-and-feathered outlaw remains a metaphor for public humiliation many years after the practice had become uncommon, such as in this example from &quot;Dark Summer&quot; by Iris Johansen: &quot;But you&#x27;d tar and feather me if I made the wrong decision for these guys.&quot; Perhaps the earliest instance of such metaphorical use appears in a letter by Benjamin Franklin from 1778.

In more recent years, tarring and feathering can refer to cancel culture, or mass vendetta campaigns on social media.

===Influence===
Archaeologist assumed that the public awareness of tarring and feathering has contributed to another legend present in popular culture, the use of hot tar and pitch as a defensive weapon in medieval castles.

They are the sister group to the clade Cavitaves, which includes the Leptosomiformes (the cuckoo roller), Trogoniformes (trogons), Bucerotiformes (hornbills and hoopoes), Piciformes (woodpeckers, toucans, and barbets) and Coraciformes (kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, motmots, and todies). This group is now confined to sub-Saharan Africa, and it is the only bird order confined entirely to that continent, with the possible exception of turacos which are considered by some as the distinct order Musophagiformes, and the cuckoo roller, which is the only member of the order Leptosomiformes, and which is found in Madagascar but not mainland Africa. Mousebirds had a wider range in the Paleogene, with a widespread distribution in Europe and North America during the Paleocene.

==Description==
Mousebirds are slender greyish or brown birds with soft, hairlike body feathers. They are typically about in body length, with a long, thin tail a further in length, and weigh . They are arboreal and scurry through the leaves like rodents, in search of berries, fruit and buds. This habit, and their legs, gives rise to the group&#x27;s English name. They are acrobatic, and can feed upside down. All species have strong claws and reversible outer toes (pamprodactyl feet). They also have crests and stubby bills.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Mousebirds are gregarious, again reinforcing the analogy with mice, and are found in bands of about 20 in lightly wooded country. These birds build cup-shaped twig nests in trees, which are lined with grasses. Clutches of two to three eggs are typically laid.

==Systematics and evolution==
The mousebirds could be considered &quot;living fossils&quot; as the six species extant today are merely the survivors of a lineage that was massively more diverse in the early Paleogene and Miocene. There are comparatively abundant fossils of Coliiformes, but it has not been easy to assemble a robust phylogeny. The family is documented to exist from the Early Paleocene onwards; by at least the Late Eocene, two families are known to have existed, the extant Coliidae and the longer-billed prehistorically extinct Sandcoleidae.

The latter were previously a separate order, but eventually it was realized that they had come to group ancestral Coraciiformes, the actual sandcoleids and forms like &quot;Neanis&quot; together in a paraphyletic assemblage. Even though the sandcoleids are now assumed to be monophyletic following the removal of these taxa, many forms cannot be conclusively assigned to one family or the other. The genus &quot;Selmes&quot;, for example, is probably a coliid, but only distantly related to the modern genera.

Extinct Coliiformes occupied a wide range of ecologies. Sandcoleids in particular often preserve uncrushed seeds on their stomachs, while bearing talons similar to those of modern birds of prey.

<text>Giuseppe Celestino [[Giusti (surname)|Giusti]] (; 12 May 1809 – 31 May 1850) was an Italian poet and satirist.

==Biography==

Giuseppe Celestino Giusti was born at Monsummano Terme, now in the province of Pistoia.

His father, a cultivated and rich man, accustomed his son from childhood to study, and himself taught him, among other subjects, the first rudiments of music. Afterwards, in order to curb his too vivacious disposition, he placed the boy under the charge of a priest near the village, whose severity did perhaps more evil than good. At twelve Giusti was sent to school at Florence, and afterwards to Pistoia and to Lucca; and during those years he wrote his first verses.

In 1826, Giusti went to study law at the University of Pisa. He disliked the subject. Partly because of a political satire he wrote that displeased authorities, it took him eight years, instead of the customary four, before he eventually earned a law degree in 1834. On graduating, Giusti proceeded to establish himself in Florence, Italy, claiming to his parents it was to practice law, but he instead pursued his literary interests. Despite earning a degree, he would never practice law.

He lived gaily, though his father kept him short of money, and learned to know the world, seeing the vices of society, and the folly of certain laws and customs from which his country was suffering. The experience thus gained he turned to good account in the use he made of it in his satire.

His father had in the meantime changed his place of abode to Pescia; but Giuseppe did worse there, and in November 1832, his father having paid his debts, he returned to study at Pisa, seriously enamoured of a woman whom he could not marry, but now commencing to write earnestly in behalf of his country. With the poem called &quot;La Ghigliottina&quot; (the guillotine), Giusti began to strike out a path for himself, and thus revealed his great genius. From this time he showed himself the Italian Béranger, and even surpassed the Frenchman in richness of language, refinement of humour and depth of satirical conception. In Béranger there is more feeling for what is needed for popular poetry. His poetry is less studied, its vivacity perhaps more boisterous, more spontaneous; but Giusti, in both manner and conception, is perhaps more elegant, more refined, more penetrating.

In 1834, Giusti, having at last earned a degree legal profession, left Pisa to go to Florence, nominally to practice with the advocate Capoquadri, but once there, he set out to enjoy life in the then-capital of Italy, Tuscany, where he devoted himself to literary interests.

He fell seriously in love a second time. As before, he was abandoned by his love. It was then he wrote his finest verses. Although his poetry was not yet collected in a volume, for some years it passed from hand to hand, as was often the custom, and his name gradually became famous. The greater part of his poems were published clandestinely at Lugano, at no little risk, as the work was destined to undermine the Austrian rule in Italy.
After the publication of a volume of verses at Bastia, Giusti thoroughly established his fame by his &quot;Gingillino&quot;, the best in moral tone as well as the most vigorous and effective of his poems. The poet sets himself to represent the vileness of the treasury officials, and the base means they used to conceal the necessities of the state. The &quot;Gingillino&quot; has all the character of a classic satire. When first issued in Tuscany, it struck all as too impassioned and personal. Giusti entered heart and soul into the political movements of 1847 and 1848, served in the national guard, sat in the parliament for Tuscany; but finding that there was more talk than action, that to the tyranny of princes had succeeded the tyranny of demagogues, he expressed to fear, that for Italy, evil rather than good had resulted. After expressing these sentiments publicly, he lost much of the regard from a public that had held him previously in high estimation, and after 1848, Giusti became regarded as a reactionary. His friendship for the marquis Gino Capponi, who had taken him into his house during the last years of his life, and who published after Giusti&#x27;s death a volume of illustrated proverbs, would also compromise him in the eyes of people such as Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, Giuseppe Montanelli and Giovanni Battista Niccolini. On 31 May 1850 he died at Florence in the palace of his friend.

A life of Giusti was written in English and published not long after his death by Susan Horner, &quot;The Tuscan Poet Giuseppe Giusti, and his times&quot; [Macmillan and Co, 1864].

==Works==
===Satire===
Giusti became known for witty satires written during the period of the Italian Risorgimento.&lt;ref name=&quot;giusti lett/&quot;&gt;Il terzo Rinascimento corso di letteratura italiana dato nella r. Universita, by Giuseppe Guerzoni; 1874 | University text on writings of Giuseppe Giusti&lt;/ref&gt; His commentary during the early years of Italy’s nationalistic movement against Austrian rule outlived their political period, and are enjoyed for their Tuscan lively style and preservation of the classic Tuscan tongue.

His satires defended Italy or lamented the social conditions from its political state.

At first, Giusti’s satirical poems were circulated from hand to hand only in manuscript form. To circumvent political repercussions, the first collections had to be printed outside Italy, without the author’s name. His first notable satire, written in 1833, was &quot;La guigliottina a vapore&quot; (“The Steam Guillotine”). The satire announced that the Chinese had invented a steam guillotine, making the decapitation of dictators much more efficient.

===Poetry===
Giusti&#x27;s early compositions were distributed among people in manuscript form. He called them his &quot;scherzi&quot; (&quot;jokes,&quot; or &quot;light, playful verse&quot;), and they were short lyrics of varied themes, some about love, others political or social commentaries. These early verses, a literary style obviously influenced by Petrarch, were finally published with his agreement in 1844, in Leghorn. In university texts of 1874. the poetry of Giusti was described as &quot;nothing extreme, nothing exaggerated, nothing forcefully lyrical or impudently vulgar.&quot;

Giusti&#x27;s poetic style eventually departed from what had been a Tuscan tradition of jocose, playful verse. He developed his own voice and style of an elaborate simplicity, with themes of aspiration to a life that shuns social niceties and untruth. Poetically, it aspires to wisdom, honesty, frankness, and to clarity. His work held literary romanticism in contempt.

The poetry of Giusti, under a light trivial aspect, has a lofty civilizing significance. The type of his satire is entirely original, and it had also the great merit of appearing at the right moment, of wounding judiciously, of sustaining the part of the comedy that &quot;&quot;castigat ridendo mores&quot;.&quot; Hence his verse, apparently jovial, was received by the scholars and politicians of Italy in all seriousness. Alexander Manzoni in some of his letters showed a hearty admiration of the genius of Giusti; and the weak Austrian and Bourbon governments regarded them as of the gravest importance.

===English translations===
A selection of Giuseppe Giusti&#x27;s poetic works were translated by William Dean Howells in &quot;Modern Italian Poets&quot; (1887). Other parts were translated by Theodosia Trollope.

<text>In Japan, are hot springs and the bathing facilities and traditional inns around them. There are approximately 25,000 hot spring sources throughout Japan, and approximately 3,000 &quot;onsen&quot; establishments use naturally hot water from these geothermally heated springs.

&quot;Onsen&quot; may be either or . Traditionally, &quot;onsen&quot; were located outdoors, although many inns have now built indoor bathing facilities as well. Nowadays, as most households have their baths, the number of traditional public baths has decreased, but the number and popularity of hot spring resort towns (温泉街, &quot;onsen-gai&quot;) have increased since the end of Second World War. Baths may be either publicly run by a municipality or privately, often connecting to a lodging establishment such as a hotel, &quot;ryokan&quot;, or &quot;minshuku&quot;. 

The presence of an &quot;onsen&quot; is often indicated on signs and maps by the symbol ♨, the kanji (&quot;yu&quot;, meaning &quot;hot water&quot;), or the simpler phonetic hiragana character ゆ (&quot;yu&quot;).

==Definition==
According to the Japanese , &quot;onsen&quot; is defined as &quot;hot water, mineral water, and water vapor or other gas (excluding natural gas of which the principal component is hydrocarbon) gushing from underground&quot;. The law states that mineralized hot spring water that feeds an &quot;onsen&quot; must be at least originating at a depth of at least , and contain specified amounts of minerals such as sulphur, sodium, iron, or magnesium.

When &quot;onsen&quot; water contains distinctive minerals or chemicals, establishments often display what type of water it is, in part because the specific minerals found in the water have been thought to provide health benefits. Types include , , , and .

== History ==
Exactly when humans first began bathing in &quot;onsen&quot; in Japan is unknown, but historical records show it has a history of at least about 1,300 years. Many of the earliest records of &quot;onsen&quot; bathing document Japanese Emperors or members of the imperial family staying at &quot;onsen&quot; for long periods of time. At the time, &quot;onsen&quot; were thought to be sacred and to have healing properties. It is now believed those who traveled to &quot;onsen&quot; in these early records were seeking cures to disease or other ailments by bathing in the &quot;onsen&quot; water. This ancient practice of bathing in &quot;onsen&quot; to cure illnesses, often for long periods such as a week, is referred to as &quot;tōji&quot; (湯治). Some of the oldest &quot;onsen&quot; in Japan are considered to be Dogo Onsen in Ehime Prefecture, Shirahama Onsen in Wakayama Prefecture, and Arima Onsen in Hyogo Prefecture.

Until around the Edo period, &quot;onsen&quot; had close religious ties to Buddhism with temples often being built near &quot;onsen&quot; sources. During the Edo period, however, &quot;onsen&quot; began to gain popularity among the general population thanks in part to depictions of the hot springs in &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;. It is also during this period that the use of &quot;onsen&quot; shifted from being primarily for religious and healing reasons to being used for bathing for cleanliness and socializing.

In modern times, traveling to hot spring resort towns (温泉街, &quot;onsen-gai&quot;) is a popular form of domestic tourism in Japan. During the bubble economy of the 1980s, there was a &quot;&quot;onsen&quot; boom.&quot; Although the number of overnight guests at hot spring resorts has decreased slightly since the boom, travel to such &quot;onsen&quot; towns as a relaxing getaway is still popular among Japanese people.

==Mixed bathing==
Traditionally, men and women bathed together at both &quot;onsen&quot; and &quot;sentō&quot; communal bathhouses, but gender separation has been enforced at most institutions since the opening of Japan to the West during the Meiji Restoration. 

 is currently banned in Japanese public baths. Depending on the prefecture and local ordinances, children seven years old and younger may be exempt from this ban. 

Private &quot;onsen&quot; called &quot;family baths&quot; (家族風呂, &quot;kazokuburo&quot;) can be found in many locations throughout Japan. These can be reserved and used for mixed bathing.

In Japanese language, 女(&quot;Onnna&quot;,おんな) means Woman and 男(&quot;Otoko&quot;,おとこ) means Man. The ゆ(湯,&quot;Yu&quot;) stands for Hot water, but also for a Bathing or &quot;Onsen&quot;. Generally, there is a separation called Noren(のれん,暖簾) curtains.

==Etiquette==
===Ensuring cleanliness===
As at a &quot;sentō&quot; at an &quot;onsen&quot;, all guests are expected to wash and rinse themselves thoroughly before entering the hot water. Bathing stations are equipped with stools, faucets, wooden buckets, and toiletries such as soap and shampoo; nearly all onsen also provide removable shower heads for bathing convenience. Entering the &quot;onsen&quot; while still dirty or with traces of soap on the body is socially unacceptable.

===Swimsuits===
Guests are not allowed to wear swimsuits in the baths and must be completely nude. However, there are some &quot;onsen&quot; that allow both men and women to enter together but require swimsuits. Many of these mixed &quot;onsen&quot; resemble more of a pool or waterpark than the traditional idea of an &quot;onsen&quot;. In 2016, The Japan Times reported that guests were not normally allowed to wear swimsuits in the baths. However, some modern &quot;onsen&quot; required their guests to wear a swimming suit in their mixed baths.

===Towel===
&quot;Onsen&quot; guests generally bring a small towel with them to use as a wash cloth. The towel can also provide a modicum of modesty when walking between the washing area and the baths. Some &quot;onsen&quot; allow one to wear the towel into the baths, while others have posted signs prohibiting this, saying that it makes it harder to clean the bath. It is against the rules to immerse or dip towels in the &quot;onsen&quot; bath water, since this can be considered unclean. People normally set their towels off to the side of the water when enjoying the baths, or place their folded towels on top of their heads.

===Tattoos===
By 2015, around half (56%) of &quot;onsen&quot; operators had banned bathers with tattoos from using their facilities. The original reason for the tattoo ban was to keep out &quot;yakuza&quot; and members of other crime gangs who traditionally have elaborate full-body decoration.

However, tattoo-friendly &quot;onsen&quot; do exist. A 2015 study by the Japan National Tourism Organisation found that more than 30% of &quot;onsen&quot; operators at hotels and inns across the country will not turn someone with a tattoo away; another 13% said they would grant access to a tattooed guest under certain conditions, such as having the tattoo covered up. Some towns have many tattoo-friendly &quot;onsen&quot; that do not require guests to cover them up. Two such towns are Kinosaki Onsen in Hyōgo and Beppu Onsen in Ōita.

With the increase in foreign customers due to growing tourism, some &quot;onsen&quot; that previously banned tattoos are loosening their rules to allow guests with small tattoos to enter, provided they cover their tattoos with a patch or sticking plaster.

== Benefits ==
There are various health benefits attributed to bathing in &quot;onsen&quot;. &quot;Onsen&quot; are particularly renowned for their relaxing and therapeutic effects. These effects are due to properties such as the temperature, pressure, and mineral composition of the water. 

A 2014 study conducted in Beppu, a city famous for its &quot;onsen&quot;, found that regular bathing in &quot;onsen&quot; has various health benefits such as lowering blood pressure, improving circulation and cardiovascular health, reducing chronic pain and fatigue, and lowering the rate of depression. A survey conducted in Atami, another city famous for its &quot;onsen&quot;, found that individuals with &quot;onsen&quot; in their homes were less likely to take blood pressure medication than those without &quot;onsen&quot;.

There are various types of &quot;onsen&quot; including carbonated springs, iron-containing springs, acidic springs, strong-smelling sulfur springs, among others. Each type of &quot;onsen&quot; is believed to have unique benefits. Carbonated springs, for example, are believed to lead to smooth skin. &quot;Onsen&quot; facilities often advertise various health and beauty benefits they claim their water to provide. 

Water at some &quot;onsen&quot; facilities is drinkable. &quot;Onsen&quot; water should only be consumed if it is confirmed to be safe to drink by the prefecture. The water should be obtained from a designated drinking source that is separate from the water which is bathed in. The often mineral-rich &quot;onsen&quot; water is believed to have benefits such as treating iron-deficiency anemia or constipation.

==Risks==
Article 18, paragraph 1 of the Japanese Hot Springs Act publishes guidance on contraindications and cautions for bathing in hot springs, and drinking their respective waters. Although millions of Japanese bathe in &quot;onsen&quot; every year with few noticeable side effects, there are still potential side effects to &quot;onsen&quot; usage, such as aggravating high blood pressure or heart disease.

&quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria have been found in some &quot;onsen&quot; with poor sanitation. For example, 295 people were infected with Legionella and seven died at an &quot;onsen&quot; in Miyazaki Prefecture in 2002. Revelations of poor sanitary practices at some &quot;onsen&quot; have led to improved regulation by hot-spring communities to maintain their reputation.

There have been reports of infectious disease found in hot bodies of water worldwide, such as various &quot;Naegleria&quot; species. While studies have found the presence of &quot;Naegleria&quot; in hot spring waters, &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;, responsible for numerous fatal cases of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis around the world, has not been found to be present in the water at &quot;onsen&quot;. Nevertheless, fewer than five cases have been seen historically in Japan, although not conclusively linked to &quot;onsen&quot; exposure.

Many &quot;onsen&quot; display notices reminding anyone with open cuts, sores, or lesions not to bathe. Additionally, in recent years onsen have been increasingly adding chlorine to their waters to prevent infection, although many &quot;onsen&quot; purists seek natural, unchlorinated &quot;onsen&quot; that do not recycle their water but instead clean the baths daily. These precautions as well as proper &quot;onsen&quot; usage (i.e. not placing the head underwater, washing thoroughly before entering the bath) greatly reduce any overall risk to bathers.

Voyeurism is reported at some &quot;onsen&quot;. In 2016, The Japan Times reported that this was mitigated in some prefectures of Japan where nude mixed bathing is not permitted, and that visitors must wear swimsuits. In 2021, several people were arrested in connection with an organized group accused of taking photos of women in open-air baths.

== Bathing methods ==
In addition to typical large public baths (大浴場, &quot;daiyokujō&quot;) and outdoor baths (露天風呂, &quot;roten-buro&quot;), there are various other methods of experiencing &quot;onsen&quot; that can be found at various facilities throughout Japan. Examples include:
* Waterfall baths (打たせ湯, &quot;utase-yu&quot;): hot water is released from an elevated position and the pressure of the water has a massaging effect.
* Steam baths (蒸し湯, &quot;mushi-yu&quot;): &quot;onsen&quot; steam is released in either a small room or a &quot;steam box&quot; (in which one immerses their body up to their neck) which has an effect similar to a sauna.
* Sleeping baths (寝湯, &quot;ne-yu&quot;): shallow baths in which one lies down. These can be used for sleeping, but there is a risk of overheating.
* Foot baths (足湯, &quot;ashi-yu&quot;): these are usually separate from main &quot;onsen&quot; facilities and are typically free. As only the feet and lower legs are immersed in the &quot;onsen&quot; water, users are otherwise fully clothed.
* Sand baths (砂湯, &quot;suna-yu&quot;): an individual lies in or is buried partially in sand which is heated by &quot;onsen&quot; water or another source. &quot;Yukata&quot; are usually worn in the sand baths and they are mixed-gender.
* Ganban&#x27;yoku (岩盤浴): heated stones on which visitors lie down while wearing &quot;kannaigi&quot; (館内着), or a type of casual Japanese indoor wear. As clothing is worn in &quot;ganban&#x27;yoku,&quot; they are mixed-gender and located in a separate location from the nude bathing area of an &quot;onsen&quot; facility. 
Saunas are also sometimes located at &quot;onsen&quot; bathing facilities. A relatively cold bath called &quot;mizu-buro&quot; (水風呂) is often located directly outside a facility&#x27;s sauna to allow users to quickly cool down. The cycle of entering hot baths, saunas, and cold baths at an &quot;onsen&quot; facility is sometimes referred to as &quot;totonou&quot; (ととのう) and is believed to be refreshing and to have health benefits.

<text>Quintus Roscius (ca. 126 BC – 62 BC) was a Roman actor. The cognomen Gallus is dubious, as it appears only once as a scholia in a manuscript of Cicero&#x27;s Pro Archia.

==Life==

&quot;Constiteram exorientem Auroram forte salutans &quot; &quot; cum subito a laeva Roscius exoritur. &quot; &quot;Pace mihi liceat, caelestes, dicere vestra &quot; &quot;mortalis visus pulchrior esse deo.&quot; 

I stood by chance to greet the uprising Aurora, when suddenly, on the left, Roscius rose up. Please, o heavenly gods, give me leave to say that a mortal seemed to me more handsome than a god.—Quintus Lutatius Catulus

Roscius was born a slave in Lanuvium, about 3 miles (4.8 km) from Rome. Later he would encourage the legend that his nursemaid once found a snake coiled around him in his crib, a very auspicious omen, but Cicero scoffed at the veracity of this story. His master sent him to be trained as an actor after observing his penchant for mimicry. For many years he received no remuneration as it was the custom for slave-owners to take most or all of their slaves&#x27; salaries but eventually his master permitted him to keep part of his earnings and in time he bought his freedom.

The name Roscius was his former master&#x27;s, a legacy of his servitude. Provided this cognomen is correct, Gallus might have been his slave name but might also have signified that his father was a Gallic slave. No other Roman actor obtained comparable popularity and esteem. So highly was he regarded that even his pupils were assured of success on the boards. The refined Greek method of acting was currently out of vogue in favor of coarser fodder, but Roscius overturned this view, demonstrating that the highest art lies in moderation, not clown-like antics. With an ostensibly handsome face and manly figure, his looks were immortalized in verse by Quintus Lutatius Catulus. He studied the delivery and gestures of the most distinguished advocates in the Forum, especially Quintus Hortensius, and won universal praise for his grace and elegance on the stage. He especially excelled in comedy. Cicero took lessons from him. The two often engaged in friendly rivalry to try whether the orator or the actor could express a thought or emotion with the greater effect, and Roscius wrote a treatise in which he compared acting and oratory. Catulus composed a quatrain in his honour, and the dictator Sulla presented him with a gold ring, the badge of the equestrian order, a remarkable distinction for an actor in Rome, where the profession was held in contempt.

Like his contemporary Aesopus, Roscius amassed a large fortune, being paid 1000 denarii per performance at his peak. He appears to have retired from the stage some time before his death. In 76 BC he was sued by C. Fannius Chaerea for 50,000 sesterces.

===Reputation===

By the Renaissance, Roscius formed the paradigm for dramatic excellence. When Thomas Nashe wanted to praise Edward Alleyn as the best actor of his generation, he called Alleyn a Roscius (&quot;Pierce Penniless,&quot; 1592); John Downes titled his history of Restoration drama &quot;Roscius Anglicanus&quot; (1708). The African American actor Ira Aldridge, who was born in New York in 1807 and died in Lodz, Poland in 1867, and one of the finest Shakespearean actors of his age, was known as &#x27;The African Roscius&#x27;.

==In literature==
Roscius is mentioned by Hamlet in Act II, Scene II of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy, and in Henry VI, Part 3 Act 5, Scene 6

In the 1850 novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by Charles Dickens, the character Mr. Barkis calls the title character &#x27;a young Roeshus&#x27;, the misspelling apparently meant to reflect Barkis&#x27; rustic background.

<text>Clodius (or Claudius) Aesopus was the most celebrated tragic actor of Ancient Rome in time of Cicero, that is, the 1st century BC, but the dates of his birth and death are not known. His name seems to show that he was a freedman of some member of the Clodian &quot;gens&quot;.

Cicero was on friendly terms with both Aesopus and Roscius, the equally distinguished comic actor, and did not disdain to profit by their instruction. Plutarch mentions it as reported of Aesopus, that, while representing Atreus deliberating how he should revenge himself on Thyestes, the actor forgot himself so far in the heat of action that with his truncheon he struck and killed one of the servants crossing the stage.

Horace and other authors put Aesopus on a level with Roscius. Each was preeminent in his own field; Roscius in comedy, being, with respect to action and delivery (&quot;pronuntiatio&quot;), more rapid; Aesopus in tragedy, being more weighty. Aesopus took great pains to perfect himself in his art by various methods. He diligently studied the exhibition of character in real life; and when any important trial was going on, especially, for example, when Hortensius was to plead, he was constantly in attendance, that he might watch and be able to represent the more truthfully the feelings which were actually displayed on such occasions. He never, it is said, put on the mask for the character he had to perform in, without first looking at it attentively from a distance for some time, that so in performing he might preserve his voice and action in perfect keeping with the appearance he would have. Perhaps this anecdote may confirm the opinion that masks had only lately been introduced in the regular drama at Rome, and were not always used even for leading characters; for, according to Cicero, Aesopus excelled in power of face and fire of expression, which of course would not have been visible if he had performed only with a mask.

From the whole passage in Cicero and from the anecdotes recorded of Aesopus, his acting would seem to have been characterised chiefly by strong emphasis and vehemence. On the whole, Cicero calls him &quot;summus artifex&quot;, and says he was fitted to act a leading part no less in real life than on the stage. It does not appear that he ever performed in comedy. Valerius Maximus calls Aesopus and Roscius both &quot;ludicrae artis peritissimos viros,&quot; but this may merely denote the theatrical art in general, including tragedy as well as comedy. Fronto calls him &quot;Tragicus Aesopus&quot;. From Cicero&#x27;s remark, however, it would seem that the character of Ajax was rather too tragic for him.

Like Roscius, Aesopus enjoyed the intimacy of the great actor, who calls him &quot;noster Aesopus&quot;, &quot;noster familiaris&quot;; and they seem to have sought, from one another&#x27;s society, improvement, each in his respective art. During his exile, Cicero received many valuable marks of Aesopus&#x27;s friendship. On one occasion, in particular, having to perform the part of Telamon, banished from his country, in one of Lucius Accius&#x27;s plays, the tragedian, by his manner and skillful emphasis and an occasional change of a word, added to the evident reality of his feelings, and succeeded in leading the audience to apply the whole to the case of Cicero, and so did him more essential service than any direct defense of himself could have done. The whole house applauded. On another occasion, instead of &quot;Brutus qui libertatem civium stabiliverat,&quot; he substituted Tullius, and the audience gave utterance to their enthusiasm by encoring the passage &quot;a thousand times&quot;.

The time of Aesopus&#x27; death or his age can not be fixed with certainty; but at the dedication of the Theatre of Pompey in 55 BC, he would seem to have been elderly, for he was understood previously to have retired from the stage, and we do not hear of his being particularly delicate: yet, from the passage, ill-health or age would appear to have been the reason of his retiring. On that occasion, however, in honor of the festival, he appeared again; but just as he was coming to one of the most emphatic parts, the beginning of an oath, his voice failed him, and he could not go through with the speech. He was evidently unable to proceed, so that any one would readily have excused him: a thing which, as the passage in Cicero implies, a Roman audience would not do for ordinary performers. Aesopus, though far from frugal, realized, like Roscius, an immense fortune by his profession. He left about 200,000 sesterces to his son Clodius, who proved a foolish spendthrift. 
It is said, for instance, that he took a valuable pearl from the earring of Caecilia Metella, dissolved it in vinegar and drank it, a favorite feat of the extravagant monomania in Rome. The connection of Cicero&#x27;s son-in-law Publius Cornelius Dolabella with the same lady no doubt increased the distress which Cicero felt at the dissolute proceedings of the son of his old friend.

<text>Kinorhyncha (, &#x27; &quot;snout&quot;) is a [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of small marine [[invertebrate]]s that are widespread in mud or sand at all depths as part of the [[meiobenthos]]. They are commonly calledmud dragons. Modern species are or less, but Cambrian forms could reach .

== Anatomy ==

Kinorhynchs are limbless animals, with a body consisting of a head, neck, and a trunk of eleven segments. They are the only members of Ecdysozoa, except from the panarthropoda, with a segmented body. Juveniles have eight or nine segments, depending on genus, with the last two or three being added later during growth. A Cambrian species, Eokinorhynchus rarus, had about twice as many segments as present forms. Like other ecdysozoans they do not have external cilia, but instead have a number of spines along the body, plus up to seven circles of spines around the head. These spines are used for locomotion, withdrawing the head and pushing forward, then gripping the substrate with the spines while drawing up the body.

The body wall consists of a thin syncitial layer, which secretes a tough cuticle; this is molted several times while growing to adulthood. The spines are essentially moveable extensions of the body wall, and are hollow and covered by cuticle. The head is completely retractable, and is covered by a set of neck plates called &quot;placids&quot; when retracted.
Kinorhynchs eat either diatoms or organic material found in the mud, depending on species. The mouth is located in a conical structure at the apex of the head, and opens into a pharynx and then an oesophagus, both of which are lined by cuticle. Two pairs of salivary glands and one or more pairs of &quot;pancreatic glands&quot; connect to the oesophagus and presumably secrete digestive enzymes. Beyond the oesophagus lies a midgut that combines the functions of a stomach and intestine, and lacks a cuticle, enabling it to absorb nutrients. The short hind-gut is lined by cuticle, and empties into an anus at the posterior end of the trunk.

There is no circulatory system, although the body cavity (pseudocoelom) is well developed, and includes amoebocytes. The excretory system consists of two protonephridia emptying through pores in the final segment.

The nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord, with one ganglion in each segment, and an anterior nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. Smaller ganglia are also located in the lateral and dorsal portions of each segment, but do not form distinct cords. Some species have simple ocelli on the head, and all species have tiny bristles on the body to provide a sense of touch.

=== Reproduction ===
There are two sexes that look alike, although some sexual dimorphism in allometry has been reported. A pair of gonads are located in the mid-region of the trunk, and open to pores in the final segment. In most species, the sperm duct includes two or three spiny structures that presumably aid in copulation, although the details are unknown. Individual spermatozoa can reach a quarter of the total body length. The larvae are free-living, but little else is known of their reproductive process. After having laid an egg, the female packs it into a protective envelope of mud and organic material.

== Classification ==

Their closest relatives are thought to be the phyla Loricifera and Priapulida. Together they constitute the Scalidophora.

=== Taxonomy ===
The two groups of Kinorhynchs are generally characterized as classes in Sørensen et al. (2015). 270 species have been described and this number is expected to increase substantially. Morphological data has been collected for systematic phylogeny from dozens, and the integration of this with molecular data has led to a new systematic paradigm featuring the order Allomalorhagida (with Homalorhagida being retired). Phylogenomic data has shown Allomalorhagida and Cyclorhagida to be divided in three and two major clades respectively.

The oldest known species is &quot;Eokinorhynchus&quot; from the Fortunian of China.

<text>Kevin Whately OBE (born 6 February 1951) is an English actor. He is best known for his roles as Neville &quot;Nev&quot; Hope in the comedy drama &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;; Robert &quot;Robbie&quot; Lewis in the British crime drama &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; (1987–2000) and &quot;Lewis&quot; (2006–2015); and Jack Kerruish in the drama series &quot;Peak Practice&quot; (1993–1995), although he has appeared in numerous other roles.

==Early life==
Whately is from Brampton, near Carlisle, Cumberland. The family later moved to North Tynemouth when Kevin was 4 years old. His mother, Mary (née Pickering), was a teacher and his father, Richard, was a Commander in the Royal Navy. His maternal grandmother, Doris Phillips, was a professional concert singer, his paternal grandfather, Herbert Whately, was Archdeacon of Ludlow, and his great-great-grandfather, Richard Whately, was Anglican Archbishop of Dublin. The BBC documentary &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, broadcast in 2009, revealed that Whately is a descendant of Thomas Whately of Nonsuch Park (father of Thomas Whately), a leading London merchant, politician and writer who became a director of the Bank of England, and of Major Robert Thompson, a Parliamentarian during the English Commonwealth and later a tobacco plantation owner in Virginia.

Whately was educated at Barnard Castle School, and went on to study accounting and finance at Newcastle Polytechnic, graduating in 1969. He then trained as an actor at the Central School of Speech and Drama, graduating in 1975 after having partly supported himself by working for the National Theatre at The Old Vic. Before going professional, Whately was an amateur actor at the People&#x27;s Theatre in Newcastle upon Tyne during the 1970s. His brother, Frank, is a lecturer at Kingston University in London.

==Career==
Before turning to professional acting, Whately began his working life as a folk singer, and still plays the guitar, performing for charity concerts. Along with other &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; stars, he makes an appearance at the biennial benefit concert &quot;Sunday for Sammy&quot; in Newcastle.

His acting career includes several stage plays, among them an adaptation of &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, and film appearances in &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot;, &quot;The English Patient&quot;, &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Purely Belter&quot;.

Whately&#x27;s television appearances include episodes of &quot;Shoestring&quot;, &quot;Geordie Racer&quot;, &quot;Angels&quot;, &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Auf Wiedersehen Pet&quot;, &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;Look and Read&quot;, &quot;You Must Be The Husband&quot;, &quot;B&amp;B&quot;, &quot;Peak Practice&quot;, &quot;Skallagrigg&quot;, &quot;Murder in Mind&quot;, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, 2003 Comic Relief &quot;Auf Wiedersehen Pet&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot;, &quot;New Tricks&quot;, &quot;Who Gets the Dog?&quot;, &quot;The Children&quot;, &quot;Silent Cry&quot; and &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. Whately provided one of the voices for the English-language version of the 1999 claymation Children&#x27;s television series &quot;Hilltop Hospital&quot;. He has also done voiceovers for a WaterAid advertisement.

In 1985, Whately appeared in a 3-part &quot;Miss Marple&quot; adaptation (&quot;A Murder Is Announced&quot;) for the BBC. His part, Detective Sergeant Fletcher, opposite John Castle as Inspector Craddock. Two years later, his role as Detective Sergeant Lewis, in the series &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; established him as a household name in the UK. Whately starred opposite the eponymous Inspector Morse, played by John Thaw, in 32 episodes over 13 years in the hugely successful series.

He reprised the role in the spin-off series &quot;Lewis&quot;, in which Lewis returns to Oxford as a full Inspector. With his new partner, the Cambridge-educated Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (Laurence Fox), Inspector Lewis solves murder mysteries while trying to rebuild his life after his wife&#x27;s sudden death in a hit-and-run accident and to gain recognition from his initially sceptical new boss.

He was the lead in The Broker&#x27;s Man, two series of 90 minute self-contained dramas about a former policeman turned insurance fraud investigator.

Richard Marson&#x27;s book celebrating fifty years of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; comments that Whately auditioned as a presenter for the show in 1980 but lost out to Peter Duncan.

In 2010, Whately played the lead in the television film &quot;Joe Maddison&#x27;s War&quot; about strained family and social relations in wartime. Directed by Patrick Collerton, it presented a view of World War II through the eyes of shipyard worker and World War I veteran Joe Maddison (Kevin Whately) who serves in the Home Guard during the Blitz.

Upon the conclusion of filming the seventh series of &quot;Lewis&quot;, at the end of 2012, both Whately and Laurence Fox announced that they would take a break of at least a year before appearing in any more episodes. ITV indicated a continuing commitment to the series and that they wished to produce additional episodes of the programme. On 4 November 2012, Whately performed in a radio drama on BBC3 called &quot;The Torchbearers&quot;, which chronicles the circumstances of several UK citizens whose lives are changed through contact with the Olympic Torch. In 2013, the Live Theatre of Newcastle upon Tyne produced a series of performances of the unique, acclaimed one-person play, &quot;White Rabbit, Red Rabbit&quot;, which is enacted as a cold reading with no sets or costumes by a different performer each night. Whately was the actor for the sold-out performance of 10 March 2013. Following the end of the ninth and final series of &quot;Lewis&quot;, Whately announced he had no intention of returning to the role of &quot;Lewis&quot;, a character he had played over a span of 28 years.

Whately was the patron of the Central School of Speech and Drama Full House Theatre Company for 2011.

==Personal life==
Whately lives in Woburn Sands near Milton Keynes with his wife, actress Madelaine Newton, who starred in the 1970s BBC drama &quot;When the Boat Comes In&quot;. Madelaine starred as Morse&#x27;s love interest in the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode entitled &quot;Masonic Mysteries&quot; (1990; series 4, episode 4). Their daughter Kitty Whately is a classical operatic mezzo-soprano, whose career includes performances with the Edinburgh International Festival, the Royal Opera, and English National Opera.

Whately enjoys rock music and plays the guitar; he has cited Pink Floyd and Dire Straits as bands he has particularly enjoyed. He is a fan of Newcastle United on the football field, but says that he prefers rugby league, and as a cricketer admitted to &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; writer Colin Dexter that he would like to have played cricket professionally for England. Dexter devised the storyline for the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;Deceived by Flight&quot; (1989; series 3, episode 3) in which Sergeant Lewis had to go undercover in a cricket team to investigate drug smuggling.

In August 2014, Whately was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s independence referendum.

Whately was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2025 New Year Honours for services to drama and to charity.

<text>The Schlossberg () is a tree-clad hill and the site of a fortress in the centre of the city of Graz, Austria. The hill, at above sea level, is now a public park and affords extensive views of the city. It is the site of several entertainment venues, cafés, and restaurants, and is managed by Holding Graz, the city-owned utility company.

== History ==
The fortification of the Schlossberg goes back to at least the 10th century. In the mid-16th century, a long fortress was constructed by architects from the north of Italy. There are records of a cable-hauled lift being in use between 1528 and 1595 to move construction materials for the fortifications. The castle was never conquered, but it was largely demolished by Napoleonic forces under the Treaty of Schönbrunn of 1809. The clock tower (the &quot;Uhrturm&quot;) and bell tower (the &quot;Glockenturm&quot;) were spared after the people of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.

The remains of the castle were turned into a public park by Ludwig von Welden in 1839. The park contains the &quot;Uhrturm&quot;, the &quot;Glockenturm&quot;, a cistern (the &quot;Türkenbrunnen&quot;) and two bastions from the old castle. The &quot;Uhrturm&quot; is a recognisable icon for the city, and is unusual in that the clock&#x27;s hands have opposite roles to the common notion, with the larger one marking hours while the smaller is for minutes. The &quot;Glockenturm&quot; contains &quot;Liesl&quot;, the heaviest bell in Graz.

Near the &quot;Uhrturm&quot; is a café with views over the old town. Additionally, on the western side of the Schlossberg, there are two small cafés, one with table service and another with self-service. Next to the terminus of the funicular railway there is a hilltop restaurant with views of western Graz. In what was once the cellar of one of the ruined bastions is the &quot;Kasemattenbühne&quot;, an open-air stage for concerts and performances.

Below the Schlossberg hill is an extensive system of tunnels, which were created during the Second World War to protect the civilian population of Graz from aerial bombing. Some of these tunnels, including a passage from Schlossbergplatz to Karmeliterplatz, are still accessible, but many are closed to the public.

== Location and accessibility ==

The Schlossberg lies in the center of Graz, northeast of the main square and east of the river Mur.

From all four sides, steep paths with a few interconnections (one being a sloped tunnel) lead up to the top plateau. Delivery vehicle traffic is possible from Wickenburggasse (in the north) and Karmeliterplatz (south via Sporgasse) but is restricted to mornings and controlled by barriers and cameras. Cyclists only very seldom ascend, as this is formally forbidden.

The Schlossberg funicular (&quot;Schloßbergbahn&quot;) carries passengers from the western foot of the hill up to the restaurant near the top, while a pair of elevators lead up to another restaurant overlooking the clocktower. At ground level, the lift is reached via a short tunnel from Schloßbergplatz on the western side of the hill.

Two paths from Wickenburggasse provide access through the tree-covered northern side.

Another path provides access from the east, between Paulustor and Landessportzentrum and at the monument for Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in the &quot;Stadtpark.&quot;

== Entertainment ==
Each year, the Elevate Festival, a festival for contemporary music, art, and political discourse, is held in various venues in and around the Schlossberg.

In the large tunnel connecting the elevator to the Schlossbergplatz, the Fairytale Express Graz can be found. This is a popular grotto railway ride for children.

In February 2017, construction on a large indoor slide &quot;Sclossbergrutsche Graz&quot; was completed. The slide is constructed out of large tubular metal pieces and winds around the elevator. The slide rises and is long. A ride takes approximately 40 seconds and costs up to €7,80.

At the top of the mountain is the &quot;Kasemattenbühne&quot;, a free-air concert venue. It is one of the most popular venue locations in Graz and has a retractable roof so that it can be used in inclement weather. The venue has a capacity of 1310 people.

<text>Audrey Marlene McLaughlin (née Brown; born November 8, 1936) is a Canadian politician and former leader of the New Democratic Party from 1989 to 1995. She was the first female leader of a political party with representation in the House of Commons of Canada, as well as the first federal political party leader to represent an electoral district in a Canadian territory.

==Life and career==

McLaughlin was born Audrey Marlene Brown in Dutton, Ontario, the daughter of Margaret Clark and William Brown, of Scottish and English descent. She worked as a social worker in Toronto, Ontario, and in Ghana. In 1955, she graduated with a Diploma in Home Science from the MacDonald Institute, later a founding college of the University of Guelph. In 1979, McLaughlin moved to Yukon and set up a consultancy business. In 1987, she ran in a by-election and won, the first federal NDP candidate to win in Yukon. In 1988, she was appointed caucus chair, and in 1989, she won the NDP 1989 leadership convention, replacing the retiring Ed Broadbent.

McLaughlin had taken over the NDP during a peak in its popularity. However, the party began a steady decline in the polls for several reasons. One was the NDP&#x27;s provincial affiliates in British Columbia and Ontario, whose unpopularity in government reflected badly on the federal party. The rise of the Reform Party also sapped much NDP support in Western Canada. In the 1993 election, the NDP lost badly and went from 44 seats to only 9 in Parliament. More than half of its losses came in Ontario, where it lost all 10 of its MPs, and British Columbia, where it lost 17 of its 19 MPs.

McLaughlin won her seat in the Yukon but resigned as leader and was succeeded by Alexa McDonough in 1995. McLaughlin did not run for re-election in the 1997 election.

McLaughlin was an overseas volunteer in Barbados in 1986 with Canadian Crossroads International. Today, she is an honorary patron with Crossroads.

In 1991, she was sworn in as a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada so that she could access classified documents during the Gulf War. In August 2003, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

She published an autobiography, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Place: My Life and Politics&quot;, in 1992.

=== Post-political career ===
In 2000, she joined the National Democratic Institute, an organization that promotes democracy and peace in developing nations, and travelled to Kosovo to help women run in that country&#x27;s first democratic election. McLaughlin has also served as the President of the Socialist International Women and as special representative for the Government of the Yukon on Circumpolar Affairs. She was an honorary pallbearer at the state funeral of Jack Layton in 2011.

<text>People Like Us is a British radio and TV comedy programme, a spoof on-location documentary (or mockumentary) written by John Morton, and starring Chris Langham as Roy Mallard, an inept interviewer. Originally a radio show for BBC Radio 4 in three series from 1995 to 1997, it was made into two television series for BBC Two broadcast between September 1999 and June 2001.

==Radio version==
Each episode features the affable, bumbling BBC journalist Roy Mallard following a day in the lives of representatives of a particular career or lifestyle. A comedy of wordplay and misunderstanding, &quot;People Like Us&quot; builds on an inept protagonist helpless as forced to relate to the absurdity incarnated in the &quot;professionals&quot; he meets, where his relatively sensible inquiry fails in front of the disproportionate facts.

A regularly recurring joke is that of the shocked reactions Mallard gets as he reveals he is married – ranging from disbelief to exaggerated congratulations, from invitations to be more realistic to database systems refusals to accept such a piece of data. These bewilderments may root in the frequent hints throughout the episodes that Mallard is not just oddly looking (e.g. the patient at the doctor&#x27;s recognizing walls and windows but giving up deciding what Mallard was), but terribly dishevelled – as it is even seen in one extremely rare shot including him in the video recording (as he is helping fixing presentation equipment). Another recurring theme is Mallard&#x27;s quest for a coffee, or a meal, or even a room fit for a good night&#x27;s sleep. 

The character of Roy Mallard was based on an exaggeration of the writer John Morton himself. Morton had been a fan of Chris Langham&#x27;s performances since seeing him on Smith and Jones, and had Langham&#x27;s voice in mind when he was writing the scripts.

At the end of each episode, as Dave Brubeck&#x27;s &quot;Unsquare Dance&quot; is played, the mockumentary cast is credited as a list of people to which Roy Mallard is grateful («Roy Mallard would like to give a special &quot;thank you&quot; to Chris Langham...»).

The radio show was named Best Radio Comedy at the British Comedy Awards in both 1996 and 1997 as well as winning a gold Sony Radio Award for best comedy.

==Television version==
Eleven of the radio episodes were adapted for TV, with one original episode – &quot;The Actor&quot;. The TV version featured an array of acclaimed guest stars including Bill Nighy, David Tennant, Geoffrey Whitehead and Tamsin Greig.

Mallard is hardly visible in the TV episodes. He is usually just out of sight, but viewers can spot him, or part of him, in every episode; on one occasion he is reflected with the camera in a shop window. Much of the humour is verbal as characters take a literal interpretation of what others say, use redundant expressions and non-sequiturs. Alongside this verbal aspect there was more conventional humour. Mallard encountered bizarre behaviour from his featured characters and their counterparts. For all his own mediocrity and haplessness he could appear sane and competent compared to those alongside him. The lack of laugh track and the dead-pan approach led some viewers to believe they were encountering a &quot;straight&quot; documentary.

A third series was planned but was cancelled in favour of &quot;The Office&quot;.

The TV version was well received, with the first series winning the 1999 Silver Rose d&#x27;Or for comedy.

===Home video release===
The first TV series was released on VHS and DVD on 16 September 2002. The second was due to be released in 2003 but was cancelled, eventually being released (in Australia only) in November 2007. In September 2009 the complete two series were released in the United States on region 1 NTSC DVD. The second series was finally released on DVD in the UK on 24 May 2010.

<doc id="238376" wikidata="Q2711492" url="?curid=238376" title="Short-finned eel">
<text>The short-finned eel (Anguilla australis), also known as the shortfin eel, is one of the 15 species of eel in the family Anguillidae. It is native to the lakes, dams and coastal rivers of south-eastern Australia, New Zealand, and much of the South Pacific, including New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, Tahiti, and Fiji.

==Description==
The body of the adult short-finned eel is long and snakelike, roughly tubular and the head is small, with the jaws reaching back to below the eye or further. The dorsal (top) and anal (bottom) fins are of roughly equal length. The colour varies considerably from one individual to another; a deep olive-green is typical but it can be much lighter; golden or even (rarely) yellowish. There are no markings of note, but the underside is pale, often silvery, and the fins greenish. When full grown, they reach about 90 cm. The short-finned eel has a typical regeneration time of 15 to 30 years for females and it reaches a maximum size of about 1.1 m and 3 kg. Males tend to be slower growing and reach a smaller adult size.

Anguillid eels are undifferentiated gonochoristic fish. This means that the sex of the animal is determined from an undifferentiated gonad. Differentiation then occurs and an eel becomes male or female, and this is generally correlated to the size () of the animal, not its age.

==Distribution and habitat==
They are common throughout the lowlands of New Zealand, including both Chatham and Stewart Island/Rakiura, but tend not to ascend as far inland as New Zealand longfin eels.

In Australia, they are restricted to the area on the seaward side of the Great Dividing Range, from about Mount Gambier in the south-eastern corner of South Australia, through Victoria, Tasmania, the Bass Strait islands, and up the eastern seaboard to the Richmond River in northern New South Wales. Unable to scale the Great Dividing Range, and not extending as far west as the outlet of the Murray River, they are excluded from the thousands of kilometres of waterways that drain inland eastern Australia.

&quot;A. australis&quot; is the most widely distributed longitudinally of the Anguillid eels, where its larvae can be found just south of Fiji to the north-west of Australia in the Southern Equatorial Current region (14.5–21°S, 154–179.5°E). 

During their life cycle however, eels migrate over huge distances to spawn.

==Feeding==
They are carnivorous, and ferocious predators, eating crustaceans, fish, frogs, birds, snakes, and Australian native water rats (rakali).

==Life cycle==
Like the other anguillids, short-finned eels are catadromous: when they reach maturity, they stop feeding and migrate downstream to the sea, then anything up to three or four thousand kilometres to a spawning ground in deep water somewhere in the Coral Sea off New Caledonia. The larvae recruit from the sea as small adults when they lack colour and are transparent-giving them the name &quot;glass eel&quot;. Tropical species have year-round recruitment, whereas temperate species such as the short-finned eel have strong seasonal recruitment. Recent evidence that has utilised analytical microchemical techniques in eel otoliths has suggested that eels are facultatively catadromous rather than obligatory. Discrete populations of ocean and estuarine residents exist, that very rarely enter freshwater.

The leptocephalus (&quot;narrow head&quot; larvae), drift on the ocean currents (off Australia, the South Equatorial Current and eventually reach coastal waters, where they metamorphose into &quot;glass eels&quot; (tiny, semi-transparent eels). At this stage they are unable to eat, and can only eat after reaching an estuary or river mouth, where they metamorphose again into elvers, which are darker in colour. From there, they migrate upstream, traversing numerous obstacles — if necessary, leaving the water and travelling short distances over moist ground. They are well-suited to this task, being able to absorb some of the oxygen they need through the skin.

It is only when they reach about in length that they hit puberty and it is only then that their sex, which depends on population density, is determined. In an area with many eels, they tend to turn into males, whereas further upstream, where there are fewer eels, they are more likely to become female. Eventually, they take up residence in a lake, swamp, dam or river, typically occupying a home range of about in length, where they remain until they reach maturity at about 14 years for males and 18 to 24 years for females.

At some point, the eels start changing their shape again, to prepare for a trip back into the ocean for spawning. Their digestive system shrinks and their gonads become larger, to make room for the eggs and sperm that they will be making, and they stop eating. Their eyes get bigger, and their heads pointier, possibly an adaptation for better ocean swimming. In the case of the south-east Australian eels, they head north up the east coast, heading for the Coral Sea. A 2021 study by the Arthur Rylah Institute tracked short-finned eels that travelled from western Victoria up the east coast to the Coral Sea. The study did not establish where the eels spawned, but the researchers thought that it was somewhere near New Caledonia.

===Reproductive biology===
, the reproductive biology of these eels has remained elusive during the marine phase. Much is known about the longer freshwater phase from the juvenile to pubertal stage, but much less is known about the marine stage Research done in 2008 identified that tropical species such as &quot;A. reinhardtii&quot; (Australian long-finned eels) have a shorter larval migration and faster corresponding growth, suggesting a water temperature effect on growth.

Like other anguillids, short-finned eels are remarkably hardy: they can tolerate high water temperatures and low oxygen concentrations, endure long periods without food, and bury themselves in mud or sand and enter an energy-saving torpor when the water temperature drops below 10°C. They are one of the few Australian freshwater fish to have coped well with the introduction of European and American species.

==As food==
Short-finned eels make excellent eating and have long been esteemed as an important food. The consumption of short-finned eels is a longstanding tradition in many Pacific nations, including Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

Prior to European settlement at least two Aboriginal Australian nations, the Gunditjmara and the Djab wurrung from Western Victoria, farmed eels on a large scale, trading smoked eel with distant communities in return for other goods.

For the Māori people of New Zealand, starved of protein after the extinction of New Zealand megafauna, the short-finned eel was a significant food resource. The short-finned eel is known to Māori as , alongside the endemic New Zealand longfin eel. They had a highly developed fishery for freshwater eels before the arrival of Europeans, and an extensive knowledge of the ecology of eels, harvesting them through a variety of techniques. Present-day recreational anglers catch and eat them regularly, and New Zealand has a well-established commercial eel fishery. Māori are now concerned that the commercial fishery is compromising their ability to harvest short-finned eels for ceremonial purposes. 

===Decline of wild seed===
The main reason that the aquaculture of Anguillid eels has become more popular in recent times is that the wild seed supply cannot support the demand of the consumer. Because of declining catches of both the European and Japanese glass eels, seed from the short-finned eels is at a commercial premium. The increasing pressure on eels has led to reduced recruitment of juveniles of anguilid species which limits the industry and potentially leads to ecological impacts. Supply of seed to aquaculture operations of these eels relies solely on wild stocks of glass eels. These stocks are declining and there is now pressure being placed on the development of intensive eel culture technology. Anguillid eels cannot be reared from eggs in a culture setting, it is the glass eels caught from wild stock that are reared.

==Aquaculture of the short-finned eel==
===History===
Extensive systems of aquaculture to farm the short-finned eel were developed by the Gunditjmara people of western Victoria, Australia, dating to at least 7,000 years ago in the wetlands created by the Tyrendarra lava flow of the Budj Bim volcano. Today, the areas are protected by three Budj Bim heritage areas. The eel was known as kooyang in the Gunditjmara language.

===Current industry===
Since short-finned eels make excellent eating, there is global demand for them. The major market is Japan with smaller markets in other parts of Asia and in Europe. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing animal food producing sector in the world, having an annual growth rate of 6.9%. The worldwide production of Anguillid eels from aquaculture is estimated to be 242 000 t per annum with a value of $US 1 billion. Chinese eel aquaculture production has increased dramatically over the last 10 years, now accounting for 75% of the total annual world production, and relies on the demand of the Japanese market.
Techniques for artificial breeding of the Japanese eel &quot;A. japonica&quot; have been studied intensively since the 1960s. It is difficult to rear these animals in captivity, the main problem being incomplete techniques for inducing sexual maturation and incomplete rearing techniques of larvae.

However the main way that full growth of oocytes is achieved is by repeated injections of salmon pituitary extracts, and also additions of other hormones.

===Development of the industry===
The important factors for developing and growing this industry are having viable and reliable seed sources, as well as understanding the basic biology of the animal. This includes an understanding of the times at which spawning in freshwater occurs as well as maintaining a sustainable catch of any given population.

Eel farming was trialled in New Zealand in the 1970s but had limited success. However, the implementation of new technology has made farming a viable option once more, with greater production efficiency. NIWA (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research) has begun developing culture and husbandry techniques in freshwater, and will also be investigating trials in saltwater.

New Zealand is in a unique position where the shortfin eel stock, despite heavy exploitation, show little evidence of decline nationally. New Zealand is therefore in a position to enhance global production of shortfin eels and relieve pressure on other stocks around the world in countries such as China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan where aquaculture potential has been limited.

Most eel culture facilities utilise freshwater. However a saltwater eel farm operated in Bristol in the United Kingdom for 15 years, using warm seawater growing eels to a marketable size in 18–24 months (it was shut down for economic reasons.)

Water temperature has a notable effect on the metabolic activity of fish species. Anguillids can withstand a wide variety of temperatures but the optimum temperature in cultured species is between 22 °C and 28 °C- at this temperature growth is maximised Recent work has determined that the optimal water temperature is for maximal growth of short-finned eels is 26.5 °C, and salinity is optimum at 17.5%. These parameters were shown to give the highest mean specific growth rate of these eels. It has been shown in the European eel that they achieve higher growth when in saline. Much research continues in this area.

===Sustainability of aquaculture operations===
A major problem in the sustainability of aquaculture of these eels is controlling reproduction and larval development. Culture conditions have a skewed male sex ratio from a small body size. This size difference between sexes is seen in eels housed within a tank. Males are smaller than females and some size difference extends 3g-270g. Many fisheries therefore concentrate on females, except for the Lake Ellesmere (New Zealand) fishery which consists of a two-thirds male catch. The goal of many aquaculture operations is to favour female development, the most common way is by the addition of hormones however this is not favoured in all areas of the world.

<doc id="238377" wikidata="Q170477" url="?curid=238377" title="Chimney">
<text>A chimney is an architectural ventilation structure made of masonry, clay or metal that isolates hot toxic exhaust gases or smoke produced by a boiler, stove, furnace, incinerator, or fireplace from human living areas. Chimneys are typically vertical, or as near as possible to vertical, to ensure that the gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney effect. The space inside a chimney is called the &quot;flue&quot;. Chimneys are adjacent to large industrial refineries, fossil fuel combustion facilities or part of buildings, steam locomotives and ships.

In the United States, the term &quot;smokestack industry&quot; refers to the environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels by industrial society, including the electric industry during its earliest history. The term smokestack (colloquially, stack) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, and the term funnel can also be used.

The height of a chimney influences its ability to transfer flue gases to the external environment via stack effect. Additionally, the dispersion of pollutants at higher altitudes can reduce their impact on the immediate surroundings. The dispersion of pollutants over a greater area can reduce their concentrations and facilitate compliance with regulatory limits.

==History==
Industrial chimney use dates to the Romans, who drew smoke from their bakeries with tubes embedded in the walls. However, domestic chimneys first appeared in large dwellings in northern Europe in the 12th century. The earliest surviving example of an English chimney is at the keep of Conisbrough Castle in Yorkshire, which dates from 1185 AD, but they did not become common in houses until the 16th and 17th centuries. Smoke hoods were an early method of collecting the smoke into a chimney. These were typically much wider than modern chimneys and started relatively high above the fire, meaning more heat could escape into the room. Because the air going up the shaft was cooler, these could be made of less fireproof materials. Another step in the development of chimneys was the use of built-in ovens which allowed the household to bake at home. Industrial chimneys became common in the late 18th century.

Chimneys in ordinary dwellings were first built of wood and plaster or mud. Since then chimneys have traditionally been built of brick or stone, both in small and large buildings. Early chimneys were of simple brick construction. Later chimneys were constructed by placing the bricks around tile liners. To control downdrafts, venting caps (often called &quot;chimney pots&quot;) with a variety of designs are sometimes placed on the top of chimneys.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the methods used to extract lead from its ore produced large amounts of toxic fumes. In the north of England, long near-horizontal chimneys were built, often more than 3 km (2 mi) long, which typically terminated in a short vertical chimney in a remote location where the fumes would cause less harm. Lead and silver deposits formed on the inside of these long chimneys, and periodically workers would be sent along the chimneys to scrape off these valuable deposits.

==Construction==

As a result of the limited ability to handle transverse loads with brick, chimneys in houses were often built in a &quot;stack&quot;, with a fireplace on each floor of the house sharing a single chimney, often with such a stack at the front and back of the house. Today&#x27;s central heating systems have made chimney placement less critical, and the use of non-structural gas vent pipe allows a flue gas conduit to be installed around obstructions and through walls.
Most modern high-efficiency heating appliances do not require a chimney. Such appliances are generally installed near an external wall, and a noncombustible wall thimble allows a vent pipe to run directly through the external wall.

On a pitched roof where a chimney penetrates a roof, flashing is used to seal up the joints. The down-slope piece is called an apron, the sides receive step flashing and a cricket is used to divert water around the upper side of the chimney underneath the flashing.

Industrial chimneys are commonly referred to as flue-gas stacks and are generally external structures, as opposed to those built into the wall of a building. They are generally located adjacent to a steam-generating boiler or industrial furnace and the gases are carried to them with ductwork. Today the use of reinforced concrete has almost entirely replaced brick as a structural element in the construction of industrial chimneys. Refractory bricks are often used as a lining, particularly if the type of fuel being burned generates flue gases containing acids. Modern industrial chimneys sometimes consist of a concrete windshield with a number of flues on the inside.

The high steam plant chimney at the Secunda CTL&#x27;s synthetic fuel plant in Secunda, South Africa consists of a 26 m (85 ft) diameter windshield with four 4.6 metre diameter concrete flues which are lined with refractory bricks built on rings of corbels spaced at 10 metre intervals. The reinforced concrete can be cast by conventional formwork or sliding formwork. The height is to ensure the pollutants are dispersed over a wider area to meet legal or other safety requirements.

==Residential flue liners==


A flue liner is a secondary barrier in a chimney that protects the masonry from the acidic products of combustion, helps prevent flue gas from entering the house, and reduces the size of an oversized flue. Since the 1950s, building codes in many locations require newly built chimneys to have a flue liner. Chimneys built without a liner can usually have a liner added, but the type of liner needs to match the type of appliance it services. Flue liners may be clay or concrete tile, metal, or poured in place concrete.

Clay tile flue liners are very common in the United States, although it is the only liner that does not meet Underwriters Laboratories 1777 approval and frequently they have problems such as cracked tiles and improper installation. Clay tiles are usually about long, available in various sizes and shapes, and are installed in new construction as the chimney is built. A refractory cement is used between each tile.

Metal liners may be stainless steel, aluminum, or galvanized iron and may be flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and non-condensing oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with high efficiency condensing gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double wall stainless steel pipe or triple wall, air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are uninsulated double wall pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent non-condensing gas appliances. These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer.

Concrete flue liners are like clay liners but are made of a refractory cement and are more durable than the clay liners.

Poured in place concrete liners are made by pouring special concrete into the existing chimney with a form. These liners are highly durable, work with any heating appliance, and can reinforce a weak chimney, but they are irreversible.

==Chimney pots, caps, and tops==

A chimney pot is placed on top of the chimney to expand the length of the chimney inexpensively, and to improve the chimney&#x27;s draft. A chimney with more than one pot on it indicates that multiple fireplaces on different floors share the chimney.

A cowl is placed on top of the chimney to prevent birds and other animals from nesting in the chimney. They often feature a rain guard to prevent rain or snow from going down the chimney. A metal wire mesh is often used as a spark arrestor to minimize burning debris from rising out of the chimney and making it onto the roof. Although the masonry inside the chimney can absorb a large amount of moisture which later evaporates, rainwater can collect at the base of the chimney. Sometimes weep holes are placed at the bottom of the chimney to drain out collected water.

A chimney cowl or wind directional cap is a helmet-shaped chimney cap that rotates to align with the wind and prevent a downdraft of smoke and wind down the chimney.

An &quot;H-style cap&quot; is a chimney top constructed from chimney pipes shaped like the letter H. It is an age-old method of regulating draft in situations where prevailing winds or turbulences cause downdraft and back-puffing. Although the H cap has a distinct advantage over most other downdraft caps, it fell out of favor because of its bulky design. It is found mostly in marine use but has been regaining popularity due to its energy-saving functionality. The H-cap stabilizes the draft rather than increasing it. Other downdraft caps are based on the Venturi effect, solving downdraft problems by increasing the updraft constantly resulting in much higher fuel consumption.

A chimney damper is a metal plate that can be positioned to close off the chimney when not in use and prevent outside air from entering the interior space, and can be opened to permit hot gases to exhaust when a fire is burning. A &quot;top damper&quot; or &quot;cap damper&quot; is a metal spring door placed at the top of the chimney with a long metal chain that allows one to open and close the damper from the fireplace. A &quot;throat damper&quot; is a metal plate at the base of the chimney, just above the firebox, that can be opened and closed by a lever, gear, or chain to seal off the fireplace from the chimney. The advantage of a top damper is the tight weatherproof seal that it provides when closed, which prevents cold outside air from flowing down the chimney and into the living space—a feature that can rarely be matched by the metal-on-metal seal afforded by a throat damper. Additionally, because the throat damper is subjected to intense heat from the fire directly below, it is common for the metal to become warped over time, thus further degrading the ability of the throat damper to seal. However, the advantage of a throat damper is that it seals off the living space from the air mass in the chimney, which, especially for chimneys positioned on an outside of wall of the home, is generally very cold. It is possible in practice to use both a top damper and a throat damper to obtain the benefits of both. The two top damper designs currently on the market are the Lyemance (pivoting door) and the Lock Top (translating door).

In the late Middle Ages in Western Europe the design of stepped gables arose to allow maintenance access to the chimney top, especially for tall structures such as castles and great manor houses.

==Chimney draught or draft==


When coal, oil, natural gas, wood, or any other fuel is combusted in a stove, oven, fireplace, hot water boiler, or industrial furnace, the hot combustion product gases that are formed are called flue gases. Those gases are generally exhausted to the ambient outside air through chimneys or industrial flue-gas stacks (sometimes referred to as smokestacks).

The combustion flue gases inside the chimneys or stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes the bottom of the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure at the bottom of a corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney. That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called &quot;natural draught/draft&quot;, &quot;natural ventilation&quot;, &quot;chimney effect&quot;, or &quot;stack effect&quot;. The taller the stack, the more draught or draft is created. There can be cases of diminishing returns: if a stack is overly tall in relation to the heat being sent out of the stack, the flue gases may cool before reaching the top of the chimney. This condition can result in poor drafting, and in the case of wood burning appliances, the cooling of the gases before emission can cause creosote to condense near the top of the chimney. The creosote can restrict the exit of flue gases and may pose a fire hazard.

Designing chimneys and stacks to provide the correct amount of natural draft involves a number of design factors, many of which require iterative trial-and-error methods.

As a &quot;first guess&quot; approximation, the following equation can be used to estimate the natural draught/draft flow rate by assuming that the molecular mass (i.e., molecular weight) of the flue gas and the external air are equal and that the frictional pressure and heat losses are negligible:
formula_1
where:
* &quot;Q&quot; = chimney draught/draft flow rate, m3/s
* &quot;A&quot; = cross-sectional area of chimney, m2 (assuming it has a constant cross-section)
* &quot;C&quot; = discharge coefficient (usually taken to be from 0.65 to 0.70)
* &quot;g&quot; = gravitational acceleration, 9.807 m/s2
* &quot;H&quot; = height of chimney, m
* &quot;Ti&quot; = average temperature inside the chimney, K
* &quot;Te&quot; = external air temperature, K.

Combining two flows into chimney: &quot;A&quot;t+&quot;A&quot;f&lt;&quot;A&quot;, where &quot;A&quot;t=7.1 inch2 is the minimum required flow area from water heater tank and &quot;A&quot;f=19.6 inch2 is the minimum flow area from a furnace of a central heating system.

==Draft hood==
Gas fired appliances must have a draft hood to cool combustion products entering the chimney and prevent updrafts or downdrafts.

==Maintenance and problems==

A characteristic problem of chimneys is they develop deposits of creosote on the walls of the structure when used with wood as a fuel. Deposits of this substance can interfere with the airflow and more importantly, they are combustible and can cause dangerous chimney fires if the deposits ignite in the chimney.

Heaters that burn natural gas drastically reduce the amount of creosote buildup due to natural gas burning much cleaner and more efficiently than traditional solid fuels. While in most cases there is no need to clean a gas chimney on an annual basis that does not mean that other parts of the chimney cannot fall into disrepair. Disconnected or loose chimney fittings caused by corrosion over time can pose serious dangers for residents due to leakage of carbon monoxide into the home. Thus, it is recommended—and in some countries even mandatory—that chimneys be inspected annually and cleaned on a regular basis to prevent these problems. The workers who perform this task are called chimney sweeps or steeplejacks. This work used to be done largely by child labour and, as such, features in Victorian literature. In the Middle Ages in some parts of Europe, a stepped gable design was developed, partly to provide access to chimneys without use of ladders.

Masonry (brick) chimneys have also proven to be particularly prone to crumbling during earthquakes. Government housing authorities in cities prone to earthquakes such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego now recommend building new homes with stud-framed chimneys around a metal flue. Bracing or strapping old masonry chimneys has not proven to be very effective in preventing damage or injury from earthquakes. It is now possible to buy &quot;faux-brick&quot; facades to cover these modern chimney structures.

Other potential problems include:
* &quot;spalling&quot; brick, in which moisture seeps into the brick and then freezes, cracking and flaking the brick and loosening mortar seals.
* shifting foundations, which may degrade integrity of chimney masonry
* nesting or infestation by unwanted animals such as squirrels, racoons, or chimney swifts
* chimney leaks
* drafting issues, which may allow smoke inside building
* issues with fireplace or heating appliance may cause unwanted degradation or hazards to chimney

== Chimneys of special interest ==
=== Chimneys with observation decks ===

Several chimneys with observation decks were built. The following possibly incomplete list shows them.

=== Chimneys used as electricity pylon ===

At several thermal power stations at least one smokestack is used as electricity pylon. The following possibly incomplete list shows them.

Nearly all this structures exist in an area, which was once part of the Soviet Union. Although this use has the disadvantage that conductor ropes may corrode faster due to the exhaust gases, one can find such structures also sometimes in countries not influenced by the former Soviet Union. An example herefore is one chimney of Scholven Power Plant in Gelsenkirchen, which carries one circuit of an outgoing 220 kV-line.

=== Chimneys used as water tower ===

Chimneys can also carry a water tank on their structure. This combination has the advantage that the warm smoke running through the chimney prevents the water in the tank from freezing. Before World War II such structures were not uncommon, especially in countries influenced by Germany.

=== Chimneys used as radio tower ===

Chimneys can carry antennas for radio relay services, cell phone transmissions, FM-radio and TV on their structure. Also long wire antennas for mediumwave transmissions can be fixed at chimneys.
In all cases it had to be considered that these objects can easily corrode especially when placed near the exhaust.
Sometimes chimneys were converted into radio towers and are not useable as ventilation structure any more.

=== Chimneys used for advertising ===

As chimneys are often the tallest part of a factory, they offer the possibility as advertising billboard either by writing the name of the company to which they belong on the shaft or by installing advertisement boards on their structure.

== Cooling tower used as an industrial chimney ==

At some power stations, which are equipped with plants for the removal of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, it is possible to use the cooling tower as a chimney. Such cooling towers can be seen in Germany at the Großkrotzenburg Power Station and at the Rostock Power Station. At power stations that are not equipped for removing sulfur dioxide, such usage of cooling towers could result in serious corrosion problems which are not easy to prevent.

<text>Thrust2 is a British jet car, which held the world land speed record from 4 October 1983 to 25 September 1997.

The Thrust2 is powered by a single Rolls-Royce Avon jet engine sourced from an English Electric Lightning, and has a configuration somewhat resembling that of the mid-1960s-era J79 turbojet-powered land speed record cars of Art Arfons, collectively known as the &quot;Green Monster&quot; cars.

==History==
===Conception===
The “Land Speed Record” (LSR), which was valid for 12 years, 11 months and 11 days at that time, was over one mile (with a flying start). The record was set on October 23, 1970, by the American Gary Gabelich with Blue Flame, a rocket car on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Richard Noble stepped up to &quot;bring back this record for Britain&quot;.

The time it took Richard Noble from the idea to the first concept to the successful record attempt was nine years. In 1977, the Thrust2 project was officially presented at the Motorfair 1977 at London&#x27;s Earls Court.

In 1978, the design and construction of Thrust2 began. The hired designer, John Ackroyd, who initially trained in Saunders Roe and also worked on the Enfield 8000 electric car, retired to an abandoned cottage on the Isle of Wight for the design studies, Construction was undertaken at Ranelagh Works in Fishbourne.

===Early stages and Thrust1===
Noble&#x27;s plan was to build three vehicles: The first vehicle (Thrust1) was intended as a pure &quot;test platform&quot; for parts development and turbine tests, and was not intended for the record attempt.

Then a &quot;demonstration car&quot; should be built with the second vehicle (Thrust2), with which the interest of potential sponsors should be aroused. As a special highlight, this car was designed as a two-seater with an additional cabin on the left-hand side of the vehicle. Noble wanted to impress passengers / sponsors with runs up to 200 miles per hour (approx. 320 km / h) and win them over to his project. The last thing that was planned was the actual record-breaking vehicle (Thrust3).

Thrust1 completed its first high-speed run on March 7, 1977. The first run was performed with a standing start at idle thrust and gradual acceleration and had an estimated top speed of about 180 mph (about 290 km / h). The second run was a so-called drag start, in which the thrust against the brakes is built up and then released. At approximately 140 mph, a rear wheel bearing stuck, the vehicle slewed sideways and overturned several times. Since this &quot;triple roll&quot; mostly took place in the air and the car landed on its side, the damage to the vehicle itself was relatively minor and Noble was also uninjured. The Rolls-Royce Derwent engine with its protruding combustion chambers had sustained the large portion of the damage. The jet pipe was torn off and at least one combustion chamber was destroyed.

Thrust1 was never used again and the wreck was sold to a scrap dealer for £175. Despite this setback, Noble was not discouraged and saw this as completing the first step in his original plan. After a new calculation of the financial situation, Noble came to the decision to streamline the project. The levels Thrust2 (as a marketing tool) and Thrust3 (as an emergency vehicle) were merged, and the further development work was placed in the hands of John Ackroyd.

==Overview of the results achieved with Thrust2==
On 4 October 1983, the car reached a top speed of and broke the record at (average speed of two runs within one hour).

KTVN TV (Reno, Nevada) reporter/photographers Michael Hagerty and Gary Martin covered the record setting attempt in the days leading up to the record. The car was unceremoniously stored under a tarpaulin in the only automotive garage at Black Rock desert when it wasn&#x27;t being worked on by the team. A propane torch was used to burn the line straight down the hard cracked dirt of the desert for the driver to follow. No other cars were allowed to approach the race track except on the perpendicular lest the driver accidentally follow those car tracks as a different path through the measured mile.

In the record attempt on October 3, the following results were achieved in detail:

==Technical data and vehicle information==

* Thrust2 is powered by a Rolls-Royce RB.146 (Avon302C) jet turbine that delivers 72 kN of thrust. At this corresponds to an output of .
* Thrust2 is long and wide and high including the tail fins. The vehicle alone has a height of .
* The wheelbase is , the front axle track is and that of the rear axle is . The turning circle of Thrust2 is .
* The vehicle has a ground clearance of .
* The car&#x27;s two tanks can hold a maximum of of “Jet A 1” kerosene fuel.
* The total weight is .
* Thrust2 is designed as a two-seater with a second cabin on the left side of the vehicle in order to offer paying passengers or sponsors a &quot;ride-along&quot; opportunity up to 200 mph.

==Data and information on the record attempts==
* It took Thrust2 about 59 seconds to accelerate from standstill to : in about 9 seconds, to , after about 20 seconds , and 40 seconds to reach .
* The rubber tires visible in some pictures and film recordings were only put on to protect the highly sensitive aluminum disc wheels from damage during towing.
* At around the tail fins began to stabilize the vehicle, which was previously difficult to control (“all over the place”), so that it could run smoothly in a straight line.
* At a speed of about , a shock wave began to build up in front of the vehicle, which appeared as “fog” around the car and was later described by Noble as “something really worth seeing”.
* The total fuel consumption for each record run was approximately per minute.
* After the overrun cut-off when crossing the finish line, Thrust2 still had to coast down to a speed of before the three braking parachutes, each in diameter, could be used.
* The screens decelerate the vehicle to about before deploying the rotors at about .

==After breaking the record==
When the car was offered for sale at £90,000 in 1991, an extensive fundraising campaign was organised without government assistance to keep the car in Britain. The bid was successful, and today Thrust2 and its successor, ThrustSSC, are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry, England.

In 1997, Thrust2&#x27;s record was broken by Richard Noble&#x27;s follow up car, ThrustSSC, with a top speed of .

<text>John Singleton Copley (July 3, 1738 – September 9, 1815) was an Anglo-American painter, active in both colonial America and England. He was believed to be born in Boston, Province of Massachusetts Bay, to Richard and Mary Singleton Copley, both Anglo-Irish. After becoming well-established as a portrait painter of the wealthy in colonial New England, he moved to London in 1774, never returning to America. In London, he met considerable success as a portraitist for the next two decades, and also painted a number of large history paintings, which were innovative in their readiness to depict modern subjects and modern dress. His later years were less successful, and he died heavily in debt. He was father of John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst and half-brother of Henry Pelham, the American painter, engraver, and cartographer.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Copley&#x27;s mother owned a tobacco shop on Long Wharf. The parents, who, according to the artist&#x27;s granddaughter Martha Babcock Amory, had come to Boston in 1736, were &quot;engaged in trade, like almost all the inhabitants of the North American colonies at that time&quot;. His father was from Limerick; his mother, of the Singletons of County Clare, a family of Lancashire origin. Letters from John Singleton, Mrs. Copley&#x27;s father, are in the Copley-Pelham collection. Richard Copley, described as a tobacconist, is said by several biographers to have arrived in Boston in ill health and to have gone, about the time of John&#x27;s birth, to the West Indies, where he died. William H. Whitmore gives his death as of 1748, the year of Mrs. Copley&#x27;s remarriage. James Bernard Cullen says: &quot;Richard Copley was in poor health on his arrival in America and went to the West Indies to improve his failing strength. He died there in 1737.&quot; No contemporary evidence has been located for either year.
Except for a family tradition that speaks of his precocity in drawing, nothing is known of Copley&#x27;s schooling or of the other activities of his boyhood. His letters, the earliest of which is dated September 30, 1762, reveal a fairly well-educated man. He may have been taught various subjects, it is reasonably conjectured, by his future stepfather, who, besides painting portraits and cutting engravings, eked out a living in Boston by teaching dancing and, beginning September 12, 1743, by conducting an &quot;Evening Writing and Arithmetic School&quot;, duly advertised. It is certain that the widow Copley was married to Peter Pelham on May 22, 1748, and that at about that time she transferred her tobacco business to his house in Lindall Street (a quieter, more respectable part of town), at which the evening school also continued its sessions. In such a household young Copley may have learned to use the paintbrush and the engraver&#x27;s tools. Whitmore says plausibly: &quot;Copley at the age of fifteen was able to engrave in mezzotint; his stepfather Pelham, with whom he lived three years, was an excellent engraver and skillful also with the brush.&quot; The family lived next to the house occupied by japanner Thomas Johnston and his family, and Copley became friends with Thomas&#x27;s son William, later to become a painter himself.

The artistic opportunities of the home and town in which Copley grew to manhood should be emphasized because he himself, as well as some of his biographers taking him too literally, have made much of the bleakness of his early surroundings. His son, Lord Lyndhurst, wrote that &quot;he (Copley) was entirely self taught, and never saw a decent picture, with the exception of his own, until he was nearly thirty years of age.&quot; Copley himself complained, in a letter to Benjamin West, written November 12, 1766: &quot;In this Country as You rightly observe there is no examples of Art, except what is to [be] met with in a few prints indifferently exicuted, from which it is not possable to learn much.&quot; Variants of this thesis are found almost everywhere in his earlier letters. They suggest that, while Copley was industrious and an able executant, he was physically unadventurous and temperamentally inclined toward brooding and self-pity. He could have seen at least a few good paintings and many good prints in the Boston of his youth. The excellence of his own portraits was not accidental or miraculous; it had an academic foundation. A book of Copley&#x27;s studies of the figure, now at the British Museum, proves that before he was twenty, whether with or without help from a teacher, he was making anatomical drawings with much care and precision. It is likely that through the fortunate associations of a home and workshop in a town which had many craftsmen, he had already learned his trade at an age when the average art student of a later era was only beginning to draw.

=== Rising reputation ===

Copley was about fourteen and his stepfather had recently died, when he made the earliest of his portraits now preserved, a likeness of his half-brother Charles Pelham, good in color and characterization though it has in its background accessories which are somewhat out of drawing. It is a remarkable work to have come from so young a hand. The artist was only fifteen when (it is believed) he painted the portrait of the Rev. William Welsteed, minister of the Brick Church in Long Lane, a work which, following Peter Pelham&#x27;s practise, Copley personally engraved to get the benefit from the sale of prints. No other engraving has been attributed to Copley. A self-portrait, undated, depicting a boy of about seventeen in broken straw hat, and a painting of &quot;Mars, Venus and Vulcan&quot;, signed and dated 1754, disclose crudities of execution which do not obscure the decorative intent and documentary value of the works. Such painting would obviously advertise itself anywhere. Without going after business, for his letters do not indicate that he was ever aggressive or pushy, Copley was started as a professional portrait-painter long before he was of age. In October 1757, Capt. Thomas Ainslie, collector of the Port of Quebec, acknowledged from Halifax the receipt of his portrait, which &quot;gives me great Satisfaction&quot;, and advised the artist to visit Nova Scotia &quot;where there are several people who would be glad to employ You.&quot; This request to paint in Canada was later repeated from Quebec, Copley replying: &quot;I should receive a singular pleasure in excepting, if my Business was anyways slack, but it is so far otherwise that I have a large Room full of Pictures unfinished, which would me these twelve months if I did not begin any others.&quot;
Besides painting portraits in oil, doubtless after a formula learned from Peter Pelham, Copley was a pioneer American pastellist. He wrote, on September 30, 1762, to the Swiss painter Jean-Étienne Liotard, asking him for &quot;a sett of the best Swiss Crayons for drawing of Portraits.&quot; The young American anticipated Liotard&#x27;s surprise &quot;that so remote a corner of the Globe as New England should have any demand for the necessary eutensils for practiceing the fine Arts&quot; by assuring him that &quot;America which has been the seat of war and desolation, I would fain hope will one Day become the School of fine Arts.&quot; The requested pastels were duly received and used by Copley in making many portraits in a medium suited to his talent. By this time he had begun to demonstrate his genius for rendering surface textures and capturing emotional immediacy.
Copley&#x27;s fame was established in England by the exhibition, in 1766, of &quot;A Boy with a Flying Squirrel&quot;, which depicted his half-brother, Henry Pelham, seated at a table and playing with a pet squirrel. This picture, which made the young Boston painter a Fellow of the Society of Artists of Great Britain, by vote of September 3, 1766, had been painted the preceding year. Copley&#x27;s letter of September 3, 1765, to Capt. R. G. Bruce, of the &quot;John and Sukey&quot;, reveals that it was taken to England as a personal favor in the luggage of Roger Hale, surveyor of the port of London. An anecdote relates that the painting, unaccompanied by name or letter of instructions, was delivered to Benjamin West (whom Mrs. Amory describes as then &quot;a member of the Royal Academy,&quot; though the academy was not yet in existence). West is said to have &quot;exclaimed with a warmth and enthusiasm of which those who knew him best could scarcely believe him capable, &#x27;What delicious coloring worthy of Titian himself!&#x27;&quot; The American squirrel, it is said, disclosed the colonial origin of the picture to the Pennsylvania-born Quaker artist. A letter from Copley was subsequently delivered to him. West got the canvas into the Exhibition of the year and wrote, on August 4, 1766, a letter to Copley in which he referred to Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27;s interest in the work and advised the artist to follow his example by making &quot;a viset to Europe for this porpase (of self-improvement) for three or four years.&quot;

West&#x27;s subsequent letters were considerably responsible for making Copley discontented with his situation and prospects in a colonial town. Copley in his letters to West of October 13 and November 12, 1766, gleefully accepted the invitation to send other pictures to the Exhibition and mournfully referred to himself as &quot;peculiarly unlucky in Liveing in a place into which there has not been one portrait brought that is worthy to be call&#x27;d a Picture within my memory.&quot; In a later letter to West, of June 17, 1768, he displayed a cautious person&#x27;s reasons for not rashly giving up the good living which his art gave him. He wrote: &quot;I should be glad to go to Europe, but cannot think of it without a very good prospect of doing as well there as I can here. You are sensable that 300 Guineas a Year, which is my present income, is a pretty living in America. ... And what ever my ambition may be to excel in our noble Art, I cannot think of doing it at the expence of not only my own happyness, but that of a tender Mother and a Young Brother whose dependence is intirely upon me&quot;. West replied on September 20, 1768, saying that he had talked over Copley&#x27;s prospects with other artists of London &quot;and find that by their Candid approbation you have nothing to Hazard in Comeing to this Place.&quot;

The income which Copley earned by painting in the 1760s was extraordinary for his town and time. It had promoted the son of a needy tobacconist into the local aristocracy. The foremost personages of New England came to his painting-room as sitters. He married, on November 16, 1769, Susanna Farnham Clarke, daughter of Richard and Elizabeth (Winslow) Clarke, the former being the very wealthy agent of the Honourable East India Company in Boston; the latter, a New England woman of &quot;Mayflower&quot; ancestry. The union was a happy one, and socially notable. Mrs. Copley was a beautiful woman of poise and serenity whose features are familiar through several of her husband&#x27;s paintings. Copley had already bought land on the west side of Beacon Hill extending down to the Charles River. The newly married Copleys, who would have six children, moved into &quot;a solitary house in Boston, on Beacon Hill, chosen with his keen perception of picturesque beauty&quot;. There, the Copleys lived with several enslaved servants. Their house was approximately on the site of the Appleton–Parker House on Beacon Street. Here were painted the portraits of dignitaries of state and church, graceful women and charming children, in the mode of faithful and painstaking verisimilitude which Copley had made his own. The family&#x27;s style of living at this period was that of people of wealth. John Trumbull told Dunlap that in 1771, being then a student at Harvard College, he called on Copley, who &quot;was dressed on the occasion in a suit of crimson velvet with gold buttons, and the elegance displayed by Copley in his style of living, added to his high repute as an artist, made a permanent impression on Trumbull in favor of the life of a painter.&quot; Though not much is known about his specific work process and professional minutiae, his studios in Boston became sites for high-class subjects to meet and discuss personal affairs and the execution of their depictions. He seemed to have disdain for artisan workers such as carpenters or cobblers and charged high fees for his commissions, to solidify his place in the Bostonian elite.

In town and church affairs Copley took almost no part. He referred to himself as &quot;desireous of avoideing every imputation of party spirit. Political contests being neighther pleasing to an artist or advantageous to the Art itself.&quot; His name appeared on January 29, 1771, on a petition of freeholders and inhabitants to have the powder house removed from the town whose existence it imperiled. Records of the Church in Brattle Square disclose that in 1772, Copley was asked to submit plans for a rebuilt meeting-house, and that he proposed an ambitious plan and elevation &quot;which was much admired for its Elegance and Grandeur,&quot; but which on account of probable expensiveness was not accepted by the society. Copley&#x27;s sympathy with the politicians who were working toward American independence appears to have been genuine but not so vigorous as to lead him to participate in any of their plans.

It was known to earlier biographers that Copley at one time painted portraits in New York City. The circumstances of this visit, which was supplemented by a few days in Philadelphia, were first disclosed through Prof. Guernsey Jones&#x27;s discovery of many previously unpublished Copley and Pelham documents in the Public Record Office, London. From these letters and papers, published by the Massachusetts Historical Society in 1914, it appears that in 1768 Copley painted in Boston a portrait of Myles Cooper, president of King&#x27;s College, who then urged his visiting New York. Accepting the invitation later, Copley, between June 1771 and January 1772, painted thirty-seven portraits in New York, setting up his easel &quot;in Broadway, on the west side, in a house which was burned in the great conflagration on the night the British army entered the city as enemies.&quot; Copley&#x27;s letters to Henry Pelham, whom he left in charge of his affairs in Boston, describe minutely the journey across New England, his first impressions of New York, which &quot;has more Grand Buildings than Boston, the streets much cleaner and some much broader,&quot; and the successful search for suitable lodgings and a painting-room; thereafter they give detailed accounts of sitters and social happenings. The correspondence also contains Copley&#x27;s careful instructions to Pelham concerning the features of a new house then being built on his Beacon Hill &quot;farm,&quot; giving elevations and specifications of the addition of &quot;peazas&quot; which the artist saw for the first time in New York. Copley at the time had a lawsuit respecting title to some of his lands. His letters reveal a man who allowed such disputes to worry him considerably.
In September 1771, Mr. and Mrs. Copley visited Philadelphia, where, at the home of Chief Justice William Allen, they &quot;saw a fine Coppy of the Titian Venus and Holy Family at whole length as large as life from Coregio&quot;. On their return journey they viewed at New Brunswick, New Jersey several pictures attributed to van Dyck. &quot;The date is 1628 on one of them,&quot; wrote Copley; &quot;it is without dout I think Vandyck did them before he came to England.&quot; Back in New York Copley wrote, on October 17, requesting that a certain black dress of Mrs. Copley&#x27;s be sent over at once. &quot;As we are much in company,&quot; he said, &quot;we think it necessary Sukey [his wife] should have it, as her other Cloaths are mostly improper for her to wear&quot;. On December 15 Copley informed Pelham that &quot;this Week finishes all my Business, no less than 37 Busts; so the weather permitting by Christmas we hope to be on the road.&quot; Thus ended Copley&#x27;s only American tour away from Boston. Accounts of his having painted in the South are without foundation. Most of the Southern portraits that have been popularly attributed to him were made by Henry Benbridge.

His correspondents in England continued to urge Copley to undertake European studies. He saved an undated and unsigned letter from some one who wrote: &quot;Our people here are enrapture&#x27;d with him, he is compared to Vandyck, Reubens and all the great painters of Old.&quot; His brother-in-law Jonathan Clarke, already in London, advised his &quot;comeing this way.&quot; West wrote, on January 6, 1773: &quot;My Advice is, Mrs. Copley to remain in Boston till you have made this Tour [to Italy], After which, if you fix your place of reasidanc in London, Mrs. Copley to come over.&quot;

Political and economic conditions in Boston were increasingly turbulent. Copley&#x27;s father-in-law, Mr. Clarke, was the merchant to whom was consigned the tea that provoked the Boston Tea Party. Copley&#x27;s family connections were all Loyalists. He defended his wife&#x27;s relatives at a meeting described in his letter of December 1, 1773. He wrote on April 26, 1774, of an unpleasant experience when a mob visited his house demanding the person of Col. George Watson, a Loyalist mandamus counselor who had gone elsewhere. The patriots having threatened to have his blood if he &quot;entertained any such Villain for the future,&quot; Copley exclaimed: &quot;What a spirit! What if Mr. Watson had stayed (as I pressed him to) to spend the night. I must either have given up a friend to the insult of a Mob or had my house pulled down and perhaps my family murthered.&quot;

=== Move to London and the European tour ===

With many letters of introduction, all of which are published in the Copley-Pelham correspondence, Copley sailed from Boston in June 1774, leaving his mother, wife, and children in Henry Pelham&#x27;s charge. He wrote on July 11 from London &quot;after a most easy and safe passage.&quot; An early call was upon West, to &quot;find in him those amiable that makes his friendship as an artist and as a Gentleman.&quot; &quot;In England, what [Benjamin] West and Copley did together was to create a new kind of history painting, one with modern, topical subjects, chiefly death scenes of heroes, in a historic manner, but with scrupulous attention to contemporary detail&quot; (Johnson 441). The American was duly introduced to Sir Joshua Reynolds and was taken to &quot;the Royal where the Students had a naked model from which they were Drawing&quot;. In London Copley took no sitters at this time though urged to do so. Shortly before leaving for Italy he &quot;dined with Gov&#x27;r Hutchinson, and I think there was 12 of us altogether, and all Bostonians, and we had Choice Salt Fish for Dinner.&quot;

On September 2, 1774, Copley chronicled his arrival at Paris (the beginning of a nine-month European tour), where he saw and painstakingly described many paintings and sculptures. His journey toward Rome was made in company of an artist named Carter, described as &quot;a captious, cross-grained and self conceited person who kept a regular journal of his tour in which he set down the smallest trifle that could bear a construction unfavorable to the American&#x27;s character.&quot; Carter was undoubtedly an uncongenial companion. Copley, however, may at times have been both depressing and bumptious. He found fault, according to Carter, with the French firewood because it gave out less heat than American wood, and he bragged of the art which America would produce when &quot;they shall have an independent government.&quot; Copley&#x27;s personal appearance was thus described by his uncharitable comrade: &quot;Very thin, a little pock-marked [presumably a souvenir of the Boston smallpox epidemic described by Copley in a letter of January 24, 1764], prominent eyebrows, small eyes, which after fatigue seemed a day&#x27;s march in his head.&quot; Copley afterward wrote of Carter: &quot;He was a sort of snail which crawled over a man in his sleep and left its slime, and no more.&quot; Mrs. Amory relates that &quot;both parties were undoubtedly glad to separate on their arrival at their destination.&quot; October 8, 1774, found Copley at Genoa, where he wrote to his wife describing, among other things, the inexpensiveness of the silks: &quot;The velvet and satin for which I gave seven guineas would have cost fourteen in London.&quot; He reached Rome on October 26. &quot;I am very fortunate,&quot; he wrote, &quot;in my time of being here, as I shall see the magnificence of the rejoicing on the election of the Pope; it is also the year of jubilee, or Holy Year.&quot;
Copley&#x27;s plan of study and mode of living at Rome are described in several letters. He found time for excursions. He visited Naples in January 1775, writing to his wife: &quot;The city is very large and delightfully situated but you have no idea of the dirt … and the people are as dirty as the streets—indeed, they are offensive to such a degree as to make me ill&quot;. The excavations at Pompeii greatly interested him and in company with Ralph Izard of South Carolina (whose family portrait he later painted) he extended his journey to Paestum. At Rome early in 1775 he copied Correggio&#x27;s &quot;St. Jerome&quot; on commission from Lord Grosvenor, and other works for Mr. and Mrs. Izard. About May 20 he started on a tour northward through Florence, Parma, Mantua, Venice, Trieste, Stuttgart, Mainz, Cologne, and the Low Countries. From Parma he wrote to Henry Pelham urging that the whole family leave America at once since, &quot;if the Frost should be severe and the Harbour frozen, the Town of Boston will be exposed to an attack; and if it should be taken all that have remained in the town will be considered as enimys to the Country and ill treated or exposed to great distress.&quot; This anxiety was groundless, for Mrs. Copley and the children had already sailed on May 27, 1775, from Marblehead in a ship crowded with refugees. She arrived in London some weeks before Copley returned from the Continent, making her home with her brother-in-law, Henry Bromfield. Her father, Richard Clarke, and her brothers came soon after. Copley happily rejoined his family and set up his easel, at first in Leicester Fields and later at 25 George St., Hanover Square, in a house built by a wealthy Italian and admirably adapted to an artist&#x27;s requirements. Here Mr. and Mrs. Copley and their son Lord Lyndhurst lived and died.
As an English painter Copley began in 1775 a career promising at the outset and destined from personal and political causes to end in gloom and adversity. His technique was so well established, his habits of industry so well confirmed, and the reputation that had preceded him from America was so extraordinary, that he could hardly fail to make a place for himself among British artists. He himself, however, &quot;often said, after his arrival in England, that he could not surpass some of his early works&quot;. The deterioration of his talent was gradual, however, so some of the &quot;English Copleys&quot; are superb paintings.

Following a fashion set by West and others, Copley began to paint historical pieces as well as portraits. His first foray into this genre was &quot;Watson and the Shark&quot;, its subject based on an incident related to the artist by Brook Watson, who had been attacked by a shark while swimming in Havana harbour as a 14-year-old boy. It is likely that Watson, who went on to a successful career despite the attack and the loss of his leg below the knee, commissioned the painting as a lesson for other unfortunates, including orphans like himself, in the fact that even the severest adversity can be overcome. Engravings from this work achieved an enduring popularity.

For a place over the fireplace of the George St. dining room was painted the great family picture now at Boston, which, when first publicly shown by Lord Lyndhurst at the Manchester exhibition, 1862, was &quot;pronounced by competent critics to be equal to any, in the same style, by Vandyck&quot;. But the artist&#x27;s fame as a historical painter was made by &quot;The Death of the Earl of Chatham&quot; showing the collapse in the House of Lords of the former Prime Minister William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. The painting, however, brought him denunciation from Sir William Chambers, president of the Royal Academy, who objected to its being exhibited privately in advance of the academy&#x27;s exhibition. In an open letter Chambers accused Copley of purveying his picture like a &quot;raree-show&quot; and of aiming for &quot;either the sale of prints or the raffle of the picture.&quot; To this censure, obviously unfair to one newly arrived in London and uninformed as to the professional ethics of exhibiting, Copley one morning wrote a caustic reply, and in the evening wisely threw it into the fire. Engravings from the Chatham picture later sold well in England and America.
Copley&#x27;s adventures in historical painting were the more successful because of his painstaking efforts to obtain good likenesses of personages and correct accessories of their periods. He traveled much in England to make studies of old portraits and actual localities. At intervals came from his studio such pieces as &quot;The Red Cross Knight&quot;, &quot;Abraham Offering up Isaac&quot;, &quot;Hagar and Ishmael in the Wilderness&quot;, &quot;The Death of Major Peirson&quot;, &quot;The Arrest of Five Members of the Commons by Charles the First&quot;, &quot;The Siege of Gibraltar&quot;, &quot;The Surrender of Admiral DeWindt to Lord Camperdown&quot;, &quot;The Offer of the Crown to Lady Jane Grey by the Dukes of Northumberland and Suffolk&quot;, &quot;The Resurrection&quot;, and others. He continued to paint portraits, among them those of several members of the royal family and numerous British and American celebrities. Between 1776 and 1815 he sent forty-three paintings to exhibitions of the Royal Academy, of which he was elected an associate member in the former year. His election to full membership occurred in 1783.

The effort with which Copley labored over his compositions was exemplary, but at times it may have injured his health and disposition. &quot;He has been represented to me by some,&quot; wrote Cunningham, &quot;as a peevish and peremptory man while others describe him as mild and unassuming.&quot; Both descriptions probably fitted Copley depending on his mood: he might be nervous from overwork and worry or in a normal condition. His granddaughter, Mrs. Amory, recalls that he usually painted continuously from early morning until twilight. In the evening his wife or a daughter read English literature for his benefit. He took but little exercise–probably not enough for health.
He would have liked to return to America but his professional routine prevented this. He was politically more liberal than were his relatives. He painted the Stars and Stripes over a ship in the background of Elkanah Watson&#x27;s portrait on December 5, 1782, after listening to George III&#x27;s speech formally acknowledging American independence. &quot;He invited me into the studio,&quot; wrote Watson in his Journal, &quot;and there, with a bold hand, a master&#x27;s touch, and I believe an American heart, attached to the ship the Stars and Stripes; this was, I imagine, the first American flag hoisted in Old England.&quot; Copley&#x27;s contacts with New England people continued to be many. He painted portraits of John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and other Bostonians who visited England. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1791. His daughter Elizabeth was married in August 1800 to Gardiner Greene of Boston, a wealthy gentleman whose descendants preserved much of the correspondence of the Copley family.

Prior to this marriage of his daughter, Copley had sold his Beacon Hill estate to a syndicate of speculators headed by Dr. Benjamin Joy. He felt himself victimized when he learned that the purchasers knew of a project of building the Massachusetts State House at the top of the hill, and he sent his son John Singleton Copley, Jr., then at the beginning of his brilliant legal career, to Boston in 1796 seeking to annul the arrangement. The letters which the future Lord Chancellor wrote during his visit to the United States are interesting reading but his quest was unsuccessful. &quot;I do not believe,&quot; he wrote to his father, &quot;that any person could have obtained from them one shilling more.&quot; Despite this report the artist made further efforts to recover his &quot;farm&quot;. The subject of his grievance frequently recurs in the family correspondence, but it is not certain that Copley had any reason to feel himself defrauded. A memorandum prepared for him by Gardiner Greene stated that long after the land &quot;had passed out of Copley&#x27;s possession it, or a part of it, was offered at no higher price than was paid to his son.&quot; Allen Chamberlain, whose &quot;Beacon Hill&quot; gives a detailed summary of the complicated negotiations surrounding this purchase, holds that Copley was fairly compensated at a price three times what he had paid for property from which he had had rents of considerable amount.

=== Decline ===

In his last fifteen years, though painting persistently, Copley experienced much depression and disappointment. The Napoleonic Wars brought hard times. The household at 25 George St. was expensive to maintain. The education of a talented son was costly. It grieved the father that after the young barrister began to earn his way it became necessary to accept his help in supporting the home. Lord Campbell quotes the jurist as saying that &quot;his father, having lived rather expensively, accumulated little for him.&quot; Mrs. Amory makes out a case for Mrs. Copley&#x27;s admirable management, but it appears that a standard of living difficult to maintain in the changed circumstances made much borrowing inevitable. Copley was chagrined by the failure of his &quot;Equestrian Portrait of the Prince Regent&quot; to &quot;bring a financial return.&quot; Cunningham says, &quot;No customer made his appearance for Charles and the impeached members.&quot; Other canvases involving years of labor were unsold. Troubles with engravers were many, whether the fault was theirs or the painter&#x27;s. Copley&#x27;s letters to his son-in-law in Boston usually concerned loans made to him and frequently extended.

The aging artist&#x27;s physical and mental health produced anxiety. In 1810 he had a bad fall which kept him from painting for a month. He incessantly bewailed the loss of his Boston property. Mrs. Copley wrote on December 11, 1810: &quot;Your father has been led to feel this affair [his unsuccessful litigation to recover the &quot;farm&quot;] more sensibly from the present state of things in this country where every difficulty of living is increasing and the advantages arising from his profession are decreasing&quot;. In October 1811, Copley wrote to Greene in distress, craving an additional loan of £600. And on March 4, 1812, he wrote: &quot;I am still pursuing my profession in the hope that, at a future time, a proper amount will be realized from my works, either to myself or family, but at this moment all pursuits which are not among the essentials of life are at a stand&quot;. In August 1813, Mrs. Copley wrote that, although her husband was still painting, &quot;he cannot apply himself as closely as he used to do.&quot; She reported in April 1814: &quot;Your father enjoys his health but grows rather feeble, dislikes more and more to walk; but it is still pleasant for him to go on with his painting.&quot;

In June 1815, the Copleys entertained as visitor John Quincy Adams, with whom they jubilantly discussed the new terms of peace between the United States and the United Kingdom. In the letter describing this visit the painter&#x27;s infirmities are said to have been increased by &quot;his cares and disappointments.&quot; A note of August 18, 1815, informed the Greenes that Copley while at dinner had had a paralytic stroke. He seemed at first to recover. Late in August his prognosis was favorable to his painting again. A second shock occurred, however, and he died on September 9, 1815. &quot;He was perfectly resigned,&quot; wrote his daughter Mary, &quot;and willing to die, and expressed his firm trust in God, through the merits of our Redeemer.&quot; He was buried in Croydon Minster in Croydon, Surrey.

How deep into debt Copley had fallen in his latest years was hinted at in Mrs. Copley&#x27;s letter of February 1, 1816, to Gardiner Greene in which she gave details of his assets and borrowings and predicted: &quot;When the whole property is disposed of and applied toward the discharge of the debts a large deficiency must, it is feared, remain.&quot;

The estate was settled by Copley&#x27;s son, later Lord Lyndhurst, who maintained the establishment in George St., supported his mother down to her death in 1836, and kept the ownership of many of the artist&#x27;s unsold pictures until March 5, 1864, when they were sold at auction in London. Several of the works then dispersed are now in American collections.

== Legacy ==
According to art historian Paul Staiti, Copley was the greatest and most influential painter in colonial America, producing about 350 works of art. With his startling likenesses of persons and things, he came to define a realist art tradition in America. His visual legacy extended throughout the nineteenth century in the American taste for the work of artists as diverse as Fitz Henry Lane and William Harnett. In Britain, while he continued to paint portraits for the élite, his great achievement was the development of contemporary history painting, which was a combination of reportage, idealism, and theatre. He was also one of the pioneers of the private exhibition, orchestrating shows and marketing prints of his own work to mass audiences that might otherwise attend exhibitions only at the Royal Academy, or who previously had not gone to exhibitions at all.

Boston&#x27;s Copley Square, Copley Square Hotel and Copley Plaza bear his name, as do Copley Township, Ohio, and Copley crater on Mercury. A 5-cent stamp commemorating John Singleton Copley was issued by the U.S. Postal Service in 1965—the 150th anniversary of his death—featuring his daughter, Elizabeth Clark Copley, in his painting &quot;Portrait of the Copley family&quot; (1776).

<text>The Business Operating System, or BOS, was initially developed as an early cross-platform operating system, originally for Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800 microprocessors and then for actual businesses and business models. The technology was used in Zilog Z80-based computers and later for most microcomputers of the 1980s. The system was developed by CAP Ltd, a British company that later became one of the world&#x27;s largest information technology consulting firms. BOS and BOS applications were designed to be platform-independent.

Via a management buyout (MBO) in 1981, BOS was spun off to three interlinked companies, MPSL (MicroProducts Software Ltd) which looked after the sales and marketing of BOS, MPPL (MicroProducts Programming Ltd) which looked after both the development of BOS and various horizontal software packages, and MicroProducts Training Ltd. BOS was distributed on a global basis, mainly to the United States and the British Commonwealth, by a variety of independent and MPSL-owned companies.

A popular version was implemented on the Sage/Stride 68000 family based computers, and sold well in Australia. The Sage itself was initially developed using UCSD Pascal and p-code, so it fit well with the basic BOS design.

The small BOS dealer/distributor network as well as the system&#x27;s command-line interface contributed to its decline, especially as this was at a time when graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were becoming popular. In 2013, the system was provided with an integrated GUI in order to provide a &quot;simple to use&quot; solution, which &quot;learned&quot; from its user&#x27;s input.

MPSL developed numerous products for BOS, generally targeting horizontal markets, leaving vertical (industry-specific) markets to independent software vendors (ISVs). Examples of MPSL developed software include BOS/Finder (database), BOS/Planner (spreadsheet), BOS/Writer (word processor) and BOS/AutoClerk (report generator). Companies sold various BOS accounting software suites in the UK and United States. In the UK, BOS accounting packages were considered to be the industry standard by some accountants.

The accounts software was split into four sections: Sales Ledger, Invoices, Purchase Ledger, Daybook and Journal Entries. Data entry and ledger reports were compatible with the Autoclerk report generator. This feature was especially favoured by accountants and tax officials as it meant that a consultant could sit down with a programmer/operator of the BOS system to plan out and ensure that accounting information was presented in exactly the right way for official acceptance. In the early adoption of business microcomputers not having accounts correctly laid out was one of the biggest complaints by tax officials.

An interesting feature of the command line input was the use of the Esc key for line entry. This freed up the ENTER key (also called RETURN, as per typewriter keyboards) to allow the input of long lines of code and long spans of data entry.

BOS had its own job control language, named BOS/JCL. This made it easy to delegate otherwise complex operator tasks to non-technical office and shop-floor staff, especially given the intricacies of working with multiple floppy disks. 

BOS applications were initially compiled to a &quot;p-code&quot; and interpreted as they ran. BOS had a p-code interpreter so efficient that programs, even the BOS/Writer word processor, ran sufficiently fast to satisfy users. A technical subsystem of the system programming software was made available to programmers wanting to write their own p-code microcobol instruction extensions. Apart from a 2-kilobyte (Kb) server (computing)/host kernel, BOS is written in BOS/MicroCobol, a language based on COBOL but with system-level programming constructs added and elements of structured programming, which bore a vague similarity to Pascal. In recent computing, programming languages such as Java have re-introduced the concept of p-code &quot;virtual machines&quot;. As the BOS system evolved, the need for programming in ASP.net developed for quicker accessibility and cloud computing. Harrell &amp; Son took the next steps to bring BOS back into the picture on a larger scale.

BOS initially required 48 Kb of RAM and two 176 Kb 5.25&quot; double-sided floppy disks, though it was more commonly deployed on machines equipped with 64 kilobytes of RAM and a hard drive. A computer with 128 KB RAM and a 10-megabyte (MB) hard drive could run as many as five concurrent users. When the IBM PC XT came out in 1983, BOS served over eight concurrent dumb terminals on it. At the time, this made BOS very attractive. Now, BOS runs on the same required RAM and serves up to 800,000 concurrent users as it is paired with cloud computing.

In the early 1980s, a minimum hardware BOS configuration might have comprised: North Star Horizon Z80 cpu 48Kbyte ram &amp; 2x 5.25&quot; SA-400 single-density double-sided minifloppy drive (each side used 35/40 tracks to give 176 Kb formatted, ie. BOS used the North Star NSDOS file system), Lynx 24x80 green vdu, DEC LA120 lineprinter/typewriter. Frequent diskette swapping was required during a program run, a good programmer/operator could minimise these essential changes by detailed logical planning. Not every business could quickly afford the newly available hard drives and many company managers were just reluctant to spend more and more upon what they already thought was expensive enough in the first place. Getting an accounts system up and running often involved countless hours poring over thousands of pages of illegible and inaccurate hand-written accounts in traditional ledger books. This is where the journal entry features came in really useful in order to bypass having to enter thousands of useless historical records, it was possible to reach an agreement with the accountants as to what figures should be given an initial fudge factor in order to artificially balance the software ledgers prior to going live with the new accounts system. The software was flexible enough to allow internal adjustments to data. The genius of CAP, or CAP-CPP as it was more correctly called, was to anticipate these technical problems and the initial reservations of a suspicious middle-management, and this was essentially the success of BOS.

With user-management tools in the 1980s, and application programming interfaces in the mid-1980s, BOS was considered an alternative even to the platform-specific operating systems on machines such as the PDP-11 and the VAX. The reemergence of BOS has escalated the number of users requested to be entered into the PMM system, and may require consistent server updating.

Despite, or because of, its command-line interface, BOS remains popular with medium to large organizations in the UK and US.

<text>Flowers and Trees is a &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; cartoon produced by Walt Disney, directed by Burt Gillett, and released to theatres by United Artists on July 30, 1932. It was the first commercially released film to be produced in the full-color three-strip Technicolor process after several years of two-color Technicolor films. The film was a commercial and critical success, winning the first Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject.

In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

As a work from 1932 that had its copyright renewed, the film&#x27;s copyright in the United States will expire on January 1, 2028.

==Plot==
During Spring, the flowers, mushrooms and trees do their calisthenics. Some trees play a tune, using vines for harp strings and a chorus of robins. A fight breaks out between a waspish-looking hollow tree and a younger, healthier tree for the attention of a female tree. The young tree emerges victorious, but the hollow tree retaliates by starting a fire. The plants and animals try to extinguish or evade the blaze. By poking holes in clouds and making it rain, the birds manage to put out the fire, although the hollow tree perishes in the flames after getting caught up in them himself. The young tree then proposes to the female tree, with a caterpillar serving as a ring, and they embrace as a 12-color rainbow forms behind them.

==Production==
In May 1932, the first three-strip Technicolor camera was completed. Herbert Kalmus wanted to test it in the animation field, giving the company time to build enough cameras to offer the whole movie industry, but couldn&#x27;t find any interested animators. Finally, Walt Disney agreed to try it as an experiment on &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;, which was already in production in black-and-white, and ordered the cartoon redone in color. The color animation caused the production to run over budget, potentially ruining Disney financially, but the cartoon proved so popular that the profits made up for the budget overage.

==Impact==
As a result of the success of &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;, all future &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; cartoons were produced in three-strip Technicolor. The added novelty of color helped to boost the series&#x27; previously disappointing returns. Disney&#x27;s other cartoon series, the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; shorts, were deemed successful enough not to need the extra boost of color, remaining in black-and-white until &quot;The Band Concert&quot; (1935).

Disney&#x27;s exclusive contract with Technicolor, in effect until the end of 1935, forced other animation producers such as Ub Iwerks (Disney&#x27;s former head animator and close friend) and Max Fleischer to use Technicolor&#x27;s inferior two-color process or a competing two-color system such as Cinecolor.

==Accolades==
&quot;Flowers and Trees&quot; was the first animated film to win an Academy award at the fifth Academy Awards in 1932. It won best &quot;Short Subjects, Cartoons&quot;, a category first introduced that year.

==Home media==
The short was released on December 4, 2001 on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Silly Symphonies – The Historic Musical Animated Classics&quot;.

The short was included in bonus on the Diamond Edition blu-ray of 2009 of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.

<doc id="238398" wikidata="Q4818807" url="?curid=238398" title="Bill Kerr">
<text>William Henry Kerr (10 June 1922 – 28 August 2014) was a British and Australian actor, comedian, and vaudevillian. 

Born in South Africa, he started his career as a child actor in Australia, before emigrating to Britain after the Second World War, where he developed a career as a performer in comedy, especially gaining notice in the radio version of &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. In 1979 Kerr returned to Australia and developed a second career as a character actor.

==Biography==
Kerr was born in Cape Town, South Africa, on 10 June 1922 to an Australian performing arts family, growing up in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia. His career in show business began when he was very young. Wilton, his son, recalled: &quot;His mum used him instead of using a prop, a baby prop, she actually used her son, her newborn son, so he was literally kind of born to do it.&quot;

Kerr began to work in radio for ABC in 1932, and continued performing child parts for about eight years. His first screen appearance was in &quot;Harmony Row&quot; (1933), where he gives a feisty performance as a juvenile delinquent alongside the great Australian vaudeville comedian George Wallace. Kerr&#x27;s first dramatic role on screen was a high-profile one in the Cinesound film &quot;The Silence of Dean Maitland&quot; (1934), where he displays striking presence as a blind child. Kerr is one of the most important child performers in early Australian film. He saw service in the Australian army during the Second World War, and performed in theatrical shows at home and abroad and toured with his friend, the actor Peter Finch.

==Career in Britain==
Kerr moved to Britain in 1947. During the next few years he was regularly featured in the BBC radio series &quot;Variety Bandbox&quot;, part of the BBC Light Programme. Retaining his accent, an unusual choice for performers moving to Britain at this time, he was billed as &quot;the boy from Wagga Wagga.&quot; A spokesman for the Australian town&#x27;s museum said that this &quot;struck an instant chord with the post-war British audience, who thought of &#x27;Wagga Wagga&#x27; as a comically surreal, end of the earth, magical place somewhere left of Narnia.&quot; Harry Secombe described Kerr as having a &quot;very laconic act&quot; on the show, beginning his spots with the catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;m only here for four minutes.&quot;

From 1954 to 1959, he had a regular role as an Australian lodger in the BBC radio comedy series &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. The series, with comedian Tony Hancock as the eponymous lead and also featuring Sid James, ran for six series. Initially sharper than Hancock&#x27;s characterisation, Kerr&#x27;s portrayal eventually developed into a more dim-witted character who became the butt of Hancock&#x27;s jokes. Unlike James, Kerr did not feature in the television version of the Hancock series. Kerr also starred in the radio drama series &quot;The Flying Doctor&quot; (1958–63), regularly flying in and out of the fictitious Wollumboola base as he and his &quot;doctor&quot; colleague brought reprobates to justice in the outback. Later, after Sid James had ended his professional partnership with Hancock, Kerr briefly resumed working with him in the first series of the television comedy &quot;Citizen James&quot; (1960). Kerr&#x27;s other television appearances in Britain include a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial called &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; (1968), with Patrick Troughton, and a long-running part in the early 1960s BBC-TV soap, &quot;Compact&quot;.

Kerr had much theatrical success in Britain, playing the Devil disguised as Mr Applegate in the first West End production of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, directed by Bob Fosse and first performed in March 1957. He appeared in a touring production of the play &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; in 1956. He also worked with Spike Milligan and appeared in Milligan and John Antrobus&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Bed-Sitting Room&quot;, which opened at the Mermaid Theatre on 31 January 1963. A subsequent production opened on 3 May 1967 at the Saville Theatre, and &quot;a cast containing an unusually high proportion of Australian actors including Kerr and David Nettheim.&quot; In the 1969 London production of &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; at the Globe Theatre, Kerr played Humphrey Bogart.

In 1972 he co-starred with Anthony Newley in the Newley/Bricusse musical, &quot;The Good Old Bad Old Days&quot;, which enjoyed a run lasting 309 performances. Later he had a role (with Julia McKenzie and Una Stubbs) in the musical play &quot;Cole&quot;, dedicated to the work of Cole Porter and first staged at the Mermaid Theatre, London in July 1974. Kerr took the part of Bluey Notts, described as &quot;an Australian bookie&#x27;s clerk, a crude racialist&quot;, in &quot;The Melting Pot&quot; (1975). This was a sitcom written by Spike Milligan and Neil Shand, which was cancelled by the BBC after just one episode had been broadcast. He also appeared in several British films, such as &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Wrong Arm of the Law&quot; (1963).

==Return to Australia and later life==
In 1979, Kerr returned to Australia and settled in Perth, Western Australia. Now concentrating on character roles, he played serious roles in Australian films, including Peter Weir&#x27;s films &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982). In 1982 Kerr acted in the film &quot;The Pirate Movie&quot;.

He worked on the Australian stage during the 1980s, in musicals such as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, where he received excellent reviews as Alfred Doolittle. Kerr played real-life Australian military personalities on three occasions, appearing as bomber pilot Micky Martin in &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955), as General John Monash in the TV mini-series &quot;Anzacs&quot; (1985) and as General Harry Chauvel in the film &quot;The Lighthorsemen&quot; (1986). In addition to his serious roles, he also continued to appear in comedies including the film &quot;The Coca-Cola Kid&quot; (1985) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Skase&quot; (2001).

Kerr also appeared in &quot;Glenview High&quot; (1978–79) and the television comedy series &quot;Minty&quot; (1998) and played the part of Douglas Kennedy in the soap opera &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; (1980). He was seen as Dave Welles in the Australian mini-series &quot;Return To Eden&quot; (1983) where he helped Stephanie Harper after she had been attacked by a crocodile. He reprised his role of Dave Welles in the 1985 series of &quot;Return To Eden&quot; by giving Stephanie a deed to a worthless section of land in the Northern Territory.

Kerr provided the narration for the documentaries &quot;No Survivor - The Mysterious Loss of HMAS Sydney&quot; (1995) for the Nine Network, &quot;Malice or Mutiny&quot; (2003) for the ABC), and a series for Discovery, released in the US as &quot;Animal X&quot; (originally &quot;Animal X Natural Mystery Unit&quot;).

On 26 January 2011, Kerr received the 2011 Walk of Honour in Wagga Wagga, which was unveiled on 17 May 2011. Kerr died in his family home in Perth, Western Australia, on 28 August 2014 at the age of 92. 

Kerr had been married three times. He had four children: William, Peter, Wilton and Anne. The last two were born late in Kerr&#x27;s life, to his third wife, Sandra.

<text>The Bran Flakes are a Canadian-American indie pop group formed in Seattle in 1992. The group, whose line-up comprises Otis Fodder from Montreal, Quebec, and Mildred Pitt from Seattle, Washington, specializes in creating sound collages from pre-existing sources. Until 1997, they recorded on 4-track in bedrooms and did not play any shows, putting out hand dubbed cassette tapes and distributing tapes through direct mail-order, zines and indie catalogs.

==Career==
The Bran Flakes make extensive use of sampling, recontextualizing the samples into new works, often resulting in ironic statements about modern pop and media culture. The group scours thrift shops for obscure and quirky LPs; some of their songs also make use of recognizably famous basslines, television shows, and soundtracks from video games. The unauthorized nature of such sampling has prevented much of the band&#x27;s work from official commercial release. However, they did contribute six tracks to the fully authorized &quot;Raymond Scott Rewired&quot;, an album of Scott remixes (including tracks by The Evolution Control Committee and Go Home Productions) which was released in February 2014 on the Basta label.

Following the 1998 release of &quot;I Remember When I Break Down&quot; on Ovenguard Music, on which Otis Fodder was sole writer, the group&#x27;s first album as a duo (Otis Fodder and Mildred Pitt) was in 1999, with &quot;Hey Won&#x27;t Somebody Come and Play&quot; on Ovenguard Music. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Have a Friend&quot; was released in 2001 on Lomo Records. Their 2002 album &quot;Bounces!&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s own Happi Tyme Records, and contained one of their most popular songs; &quot;Good Times a Goo Goo&quot;, which sampled extensively from Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear&#x27;s performance of &quot;Moving Right Along&quot; from &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;.

In 2008 the band signed with the label Illegal Art, known for such acts as Girl Talk and Steinski.

<doc id="238417" wikidata="Q3089739" url="?curid=238417" title="Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area">
<text>The Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area is a National Wildlife Area (NWA) located on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River in the National Provincial Capital Region of Quebec, Canada, established on 28 April 1978. It is one of the critical habitats for the greater snow goose during migration. Flocks of tens of thousands of these birds stop over to feed on the bullrushes in the spring and fall. The tidal marsh was recognized as a wetland of international significance per the Ramsar Convention in 1981, the first North American site to receive that distinction.

== Location ==
Cap Tourmente is 50 km from Quebec City, and sits on the St. Lawrence River. The park is part of Saint-Joachim municipality. The location of the park sits at an intersection of Appalachian Mountains, Canadian Shield, the St. Lawrence Lowlands. Because of this, the park has a wide range of mountain views, marshlands, and plains, leading to diverse habitats and a diversity of plant and animal species. The marshlands of the park serve as many birds&#x27; migratory stopovers and breeding areas, which contributes to its importance as a protected area. The area is located at 47°03.860&#x27; N 70°47.774&#x27; W. 

== History ==
A number of prehistoric Amerindian artifacts are found on the coastal plain, providing evidence of the presence of Indigenous peoples for over 2,000 years, starting at least 2,400 years ago. The evidence suggests the area was occupied by small bands of St. Lawrence Iroquoians, who were the dominant group in the St. Lawrence Valley for several centuries before the arrival of Europeans. They subsisted on agriculture, hunting and fishing in the St. Lawrence Valley region. In the late 16th century, the St. Lawrence Iroquoians mysteriously disappeared, abandoning their former territories sometime between the last voyage of the French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1541—Cap Tourmente was the first land fall for Jacques Cartier in 1535—and the subsequent expedition of Samuel de Champlain in 1603. 

Within the wildlife refuge is a historic farm site, La Petite-Ferme du cap Tourmente, which was begun by Samuel de Champlain in 1626, as a food source for the fledgling Habitation at Quebec City. Later, the farm was purchased and run for nearly 300 years by and for the Seminary of Quebec. A farm house built around 1667 still stands, and is at the core of La Petite-Ferme du cap Tourmente National Historic Site, designated in 2018.

The Canadian government acquired the area in 1969. It was later recognised as a National Wildlife Area in 1978 and as a wetland of significance per the Ramsar Convention in 1981.

== Wildlife ==
The Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area has a wide range of habitats and comprises 400 hectares of tidal marsh, 100 hectares of coastal meadow, 700 hectares of agricultural land and 1198 hectares of forest. It is the home to a wide range of animals and plants, including more than 200 animal species and 700 plant species. The intertidal bulrush, coastal bulrush and coastal plain and mixed-forest plateau provides crucial habitat for the staging of migratory birds and serves as birds&#x27; breeding grounds. The keystone species of the NWA include greater snow goose, peregrine falcon, and warblers in spring. 

=== Plants ===

==== Intertidal marsh ====
The Cap Tourmente NWA was created mainly to protect the vast amount of intertidal marshes that are present in the NWA, especially the American bulrushes, which attracts tens of thousands of greater snow geese during the spring and fall migration period. These marshes occupy 2,500 hectares and include close to 60% of all the bulrush marshes in Québec. Heavy tidal flooding by fresh waters on the coastal flats covers a large amount of intertidal marsh. The intertidal marshes in the NWA can be divided into three separate zones, including the upper, middle, and the lower zone. All three zones are predominantly dominated by American bulrushes. Southern wild rice (&quot;Zizania aquatica&quot;) and broad-leaved arrowhead (&quot;Sagittaria latifolia&quot;) are also present in the upper and the middle zone. According to a study conducted in the NWA, the American bulrush has decreased significantly in the intertidal marsh during the year 1977 and 2002, and is being replaced by southern wild rice. But the American bulrushes remain the dominant species in all three zones. The plants in the intertidal marsh are crucial in protecting the coastal area from coastal erosion, and can serve as food for the snow geese. Other animals also feed on these bulrushes, such as American black duck, mallard, northern pintail, blue-winged teal, green-winged teal, American wigeon, northern shoveler, and wood duck. 

==== Forested areas ====
The forested areas in the NWA covered around 40% of the total area. There are 21 types of forest stands found in the NWA, and sugar maple stands dominate the area. 

Listed Plant Species under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) include Victorin&#x27;s water-hemlock and butternut. Habitat loss remains as the largest threat to the plants species in the region.

=== Animals ===

==== Birds ====
The Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area is one of the 325 Important Birds Area (IBA) in Canada, categorised under the A4 criteria.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the population of greater snow geese was dangerously low at only around 3,000 individuals. However, after conservation efforts like the establishment of the NWA, their population started to grow exponentially in the mid-1980s, and is now close to one million. During their biennial journey between the Atlantic coast and the Far North, greater snow geese stop in Cap Tourmente NWA where they feed on American bulrush rhizomes and also grain in the fields. At 2021, up to 56,500 greater snow geese were counted at Cap Tourmente NWA. 

In the spring, they gather at the Lac-Saint-Pierre and other sites, moving west to east along the St. Lawrence River, before they head north. In the fall, the birds disperse from the Quebec City area in late October and move a short distance southwest towards Lac-Saint-Pierre or northern Lake Champlain, where they feed in corn fields and where some remain well into November and December. Cap Tourmente&#x27;s location lies right next to their path of migration, which makes the NWA such an important part in the survival of this species. 

At Cap Tourmente, bird species listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) include peregrine falcon (anatum/tundrius), bobolink, wood thrush, short-eared owl, bank swallow, barn swallow, chimney swift, olive-sided flycatcher, Canada warbler, least bittern, loggerhead shrike (&quot;migrans&quot; subspecies), rusty blackbird, yellow rail, and eastern meadowlark.

==== Fish ====
The strong tides bring slightly salty water from the river to the coastal region. The herbaceous environment with shallow water makes an ideal environment for fish species to spawn there, such as yellow perch, the northern pike, and the three-spined stickleback. 

Habitat loss and obstacles to migration area the main threats to the fish species in the region. Other potential threats includes oil spill from the upper part of the river and other source of water pollution from human activities.

== Management ==
Environment and Climate Change Canada (Canadian Wildlife Service) is the management agency of the NWA.

=== Hunting ===
When the territory was acquired by the federal government in 1969, all hunting activities were suspended. Since 1972, the Canadian Wildlife Service began its controlled hunting program in order to regulate the great snow goose population. The hunting programme was introduced to control the goose population and prevent overuse of the bulrush marsh and fields in the NWA or adjacent fields. In the fall, a controlled greater snow goose hunt is authorised in eight hunting grounds grouped into four zones with a total area of approximately 53 hectares. Participants are selected through a draw to decide the maximum of 512 permits. During the annual Waterfowler hunting day, permits are issued to maximum 12 young hunters to practice their waterfowl hunting skills and learn about wildlife conservation during the regular hunting season.

In 2009 and 2010, an experimental licence was issued to the Association des Amis du Cap Tourmente, but the licence was not renewed afterwards.

The 2022 Hunt Program for the greater snow goose is cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns.

=== Invasive species ===
Nine plants are considered invasive. Cow parsley, hedge bedstraw, and reed mannagrass are ubiquitous, and the common reed and Japanese knotweed are among the most threatening invasive species in the NWA.

== Park attractions ==
This park can be considered a nature attraction, where visitors are permitted to enter during set times with a small entry fee (up to $6 for adults) until a closing time at 5pm on most days of the week. The park can see up to 40,000 visitors per year, with the attractions being hiking trails, nature observation, bird watching, picnic areas, and planned school trips. The official websites recommend spending from 2-4 hours per visit to the park. With its location, the park itself is home to many migratory birds with the main attraction being the greater snow geese flocks.

==General information==
===Municipal history===
The municipality of Rana was originally established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). In 1839, it was divided into Nord-Ranen Municipality and Sør-Ranen Municipality. In 1844, Nord-Ranen Municipality was renamed Mo Municipality and Sør-Ranen Municipality was renamed Hemnes Municipality. On 1 January 1923, the village of Mo was separated from Mo Municipality and became a town-municipality of its own. At that time (to avoid confusion) Mo Municipality changed its name (back) to Nord-Rana Municipality and the new town was known as Mo i Rana. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the town of Mo (population: 9,616), Nord-Rana Municipality (population: 11,636), the northern part of Sør-Rana Municipality (population: 697), and the Sjona area of Nesna Municipality (population: 543) were all merged to form Rana Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality is named after the river Ranelva (). The name of the river is probably derived from the word which means &quot;quick&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;, or &quot;rapid&quot;. Another possibility is that the name comes from the old Sami god Rana Niejta.

On 16 February 2024, the national government approved a resolution to add a co-equal, official Sami language name for the municipality: . The spelling of the Sami language name changes depending on how it is used. It is called when it is spelled alone, but it is when using the Sami language equivalent to &quot;Rana Municipality&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 5 March 1965. The official blazon is &quot;Per bend sinister vert and Or&quot; (). This means the arms have a field (background) that is divided by a diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right. The field that is below the line has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The field that is above the line has a tincture of green. The arms symbolize the forests (upper part/green) and the minerals (lower part/gold), as there many minerals can be found in the area, especially iron ore. The arms were originally granted to the municipality of Mo on 29 April 1960 until that municipality was dissolved on 1 January 1964 when it became part of the new municipality of Rana. The arms were designed by Gunnar Alm.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has six parishes () within Rana Municipality. It is part of the Indre Helgeland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland.

==Geography==
The municipality is located just south of the Arctic Circle, on the southern side of the Saltfjellet mountains with the Svartisen glacier, Norway&#x27;s second largest glacier. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Snøtinden. Some of the other large mountains in Rana include Bolna and Nasa. Mo is so close to the Arctic Circle that parts of the sun is continuously over the horizon (Midnight sun) from early June to early July, and there is no darkness from mid-May to the beginning of August. But there is no true polar night in December. The Saltfjellet–Svartisen National Park is partly located in Rana. There are many valleys such as the Dunderland Valley and Grønnfjelldal.

The majority of the population in the municipality lives in Mo i Rana, where the Ranelva (river) meets the Ranfjorden. North of Mo i Rana, the European route E6 highway passes through the suburb of Selfors. In western Rana, the population centers around the Sjona fjord.

Rana and Saltfjellet are famous for their numerous caves due to the limestone rock. Some of the caves include Grønnligrotta, Setergrotta, and Pluragrotta. There are several nature reserves in the municipality, such as Alterhaug with several warmer-climate plants grow including the elm. Engasjyen, the estuary of the Rana river, has a rich bird life in the spring. Blakkådalen has old growth spruce forests. Fisktjørna, has a largely undisturbed mixed old growth forest with unusually rich plant life due to the extremely lime-rich soil.
