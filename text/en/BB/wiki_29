<text>The News of the World was a weekly national &quot;red top&quot; tabloid newspaper published every Sunday in the United Kingdom from 1843 to 2011. It was at one time the world&#x27;s highest-selling English-language newspaper, and at closure still had one of the highest English-language circulations. It was originally established as a broadsheet by John Browne Bell, who identified crime, sensation and vice as the themes that would sell most copies. The Bells sold to Henry Lascelles Carr in 1891; in 1969, it was bought from the Carrs by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s media firm News Limited. In 1984, as News Limited reorganised into News International, a subsidiary of News Corporation, the newspaper transformed into a tabloid and became the Sunday sister paper of &quot;The Sun&quot;.

The &quot;News of the World&quot; concentrated in particular on celebrity scoops, gossip and populist news. Its somewhat prurient focus on sex scandals gained it the nickname &quot;Screws of the World&quot;. In its last decade it had a reputation for exposing celebrities&#x27; drug use, sexual peccadilloes, or criminal acts, by using insiders and journalists in disguise to provide video or photographic evidence, and covert phone hacking in ongoing police investigations. Sales averaged 2,812,005 copies per week in October 2010.

From 2006, allegations of phone hacking began to engulf the newspaper. These culminated in the revelation on 4 July 2011 that, nearly a decade earlier, a private investigator hired by the newspaper had intercepted the voicemail of missing British teenager Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered.

Amid a public backlash and the withdrawal of advertising, News International announced the closure of the newspaper on 7 July 2011. The scandal deepened when the paper was alleged to have hacked into the phones of families of British service personnel killed in action. Senior figures on the newspaper have been held for questioning by police investigating the phone hacking and corruption allegations, alongside former &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; editor Piers Morgan. Arrested on 8 July 2011 were former editor Andy Coulson and former &quot;News of the World&quot; royal editor Clive Goodman, the latter jailed for phone hacking in 2007. The former executive editor Neil Wallis was arrested on 15 July 2011 and former editor Rebekah Brooks, the tenth person held in custody, on 17 July 2011.

During a visit to London on 17 February 2012, Murdoch announced he was soon to launch a Sunday edition of &quot;The Sun&quot;, which acted as a replacement to the &quot;News of the World&quot;. On 19 February 2012, it was announced that the first edition of &quot;The Sun on Sunday&quot; would be printed on 26 February 2012. It would employ some former &quot;News of the World&quot; journalists.

== History ==
=== 1843 to 1968 ===
The newspaper was first published as The News of the World on 1 October 1843, by John Browne Bell in London. Priced at three pence (equal to £ in ), even before the repeal of the Stamp act (1855) or paper duty (1861), it was the cheapest newspaper of its time and was aimed directly at the newly literate working classes. It quickly established itself as a purveyor of titillation, shock, and criminal news. Much of the source material came from coverage of vice prosecutions, including lurid transcripts of police descriptions of alleged brothels, streetwalkers, and &quot;immoral&quot; women. In 1924 the newspaper sponsored the 1924 Women&#x27;s Olympiad held at Stamford Bridge in London.

Before long, the &quot;News of the World&quot; established itself as the most widely read Sunday paper, with initial sales of around 12,000 copies a week. Sales then suffered because the price was not cut following the abolition of newspaper taxes and the paper was soon no longer among the leading Sunday titles, selling around 30,000 by 1880, a greater number but a smaller proportion, as newspaper sales had grown hugely. The title was sold by the Bell family in 1891 to Henry Lascelles Carr who owned the Welsh &quot;Western Mail&quot;. As editor, he installed his nephew Emsley Carr, who held the post for 50 years. The real engine of the paper&#x27;s now quick commercial success, however, was George Riddell, who reorganised its national distribution using local agents. Matthew Engel, in his book &quot;Tickle the Public: One Hundred Years of the Popular Press&quot; (Gollancz, 1996), says that the &quot;News of the World&quot; of the 1890s was &quot;a very fine paper indeed&quot;. The paper was not without its detractors, though. As one writer later related:

By 1912, the circulation was two million and around three million by the early 1920s. Sales reached four million by 1939. This success encouraged other similar newspapers, of which &quot;The Sunday People&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; are still being published.

In 1928, the paper began printing in Manchester on the presses of the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; in Derby Street, moving in 1960 into Thomson House, Withy Grove (formerly known as Kemsley House) when the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; closed. The move to Thomson House led to the immediate closure of the &quot;Empire News&quot;, a paper printed there and mainly circulating in the North of England and Wales with a circulation of about 2.5 million. Officially the &quot;Empire News&quot; and &quot;News of the World&quot; merged but Thomson House was already printing the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; (to become the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;) and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; and did not have any further capacity with the &quot;News of the World&quot; arriving.

The paper&#x27;s motto was &quot;All human life is there&quot;. The paper&#x27;s name was linked with sports events as early as 1903 when the golfing tournament The News of the World Match Play Championship began (now under British PGA auspices). The News of the World Darts Championship existed from 1927 on a regional basis and became a national tournament from 1947 to 1990. There was also a News of the World Championship in snooker from 1950 to 1959 which eclipsed the official professionals&#x27; competition for a number of years. In athletics, the Emsley Carr Mile race was started in 1953 in memory of the former editor, and is still run annually. The paper&#x27;s Football Annual was a long-standing publication (sponsoring it until 2008), and a Household Guide and Almanac was also published at one time.

By 1950, the &quot;News of the World&quot; had become the biggest-selling newspaper in the world with a weekly sale of 8,441,000 and individual editions sold over 9 million copies.

As with other Sunday newspapers, the &quot;News of the World&quot; was published on Saturday whenever Christmas Day fell on Sunday.

=== Murdoch ownership ===
The newspaper passed into the hands of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Ltd. in 1969, following a year-long struggle with Robert Maxwell&#x27;s Pergamon Press. Maxwell&#x27;s Czech origin, combined with his political opinions, provoked a hostile response to his bid from the Carrs and from the editor of the &quot;News of the World&quot;, Stafford Somerfield, who declared in an October 1968 front page leading article attacking Maxwell that the paper was &quot;as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding&quot;.

News Ltd. arranged to swap shares in some of its minor ventures with the Carrs and by December it controlled 40% of the NOTW stock. Maxwell had been supported by the Jackson family (25% shareholders), but Murdoch had gained the support of the Carr family (30%) and then-chairman William Carr.

In January 1969, Maxwell&#x27;s bid was rejected at a shareholders&#x27; meeting where half of those present were company staff, temporarily given voting shares. It was Murdoch&#x27;s first Fleet Street acquisition. Maxwell accused Murdoch of employing &quot;the laws of the jungle&quot; to acquire the paper and said he had &quot;made a fair and bona fide offer... which has been frustrated and defeated after three months of [cynical] manoeuvring.&quot; Murdoch denied this, arguing the shareholders of the News of the World Group had &quot;judged [his] record in Australia.&quot; Illness removed Sir William Carr from the chairmanship in June 1969, and Murdoch succeeded him.

Murdoch came under severe criticism in a television interview with David Frost after the newspaper published extracts, in late summer 1969, from the memoirs of Christine Keeler. Keeler had been a central figure in the Profumo scandal which had emerged to public scrutiny in 1963. Murdoch regretted agreeing to the interview with Frost. In February 1970, Stafford Somerfield was sacked as editor after coming into conflict with Murdoch, whose takeover he had opposed.

During the four decades of Murdoch&#x27;s ownership, the newspaper had to frequently defend itself against libel charges as well as complaints to the Press Council (later the Press Complaints Commission) on accusations of certain news-gathering techniques, such as entrapment, and contentious campaigns. Some of the better-known of these were the &quot;Bob and Sue&quot; case with reporter Neville Thurlbeck, and various cases involving journalist Mazher Mahmood.

The newspaper, which had generally supported the Conservative Party throughout its history (endorsing Edward Heath in the 1970 and both 1974 elections), maintained its political posture during the early years of the Murdoch era, whereas its weekday sister &quot;The Sun&quot; did not have a definitive allegiance, (supporting Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour Party in 1970, Heath in February 1974 and Jeremy Thorpe&#x27;s Liberal Party in October 1974) until the late 1970s when it became a Tory bastion. Both newspapers would later endorse Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour during the late 1990s and early 2000s before switching back to the Conservatives during David Cameron&#x27;s leadership.

Starting in 1981, a magazine supplement (&quot;Sunday&quot;) was included with the paper and, in 1984, the newspaper changed from broadsheet to tabloid format. The paper was printed in Hertfordshire, Liverpool, Dinnington near Sheffield, Portsmouth, Glasgow and Dublin, with a separate edition produced in Belfast. It was also printed at a number of sites abroad including Madrid, Brussels, Cyprus and Orlando in Florida, US.

In 1985, the &quot;News of the World&quot; moved out of Thomson House when the building was bought by the tycoon Robert Maxwell (and renamed Maxwell House) and, after a short spell on the &quot;Daily Express&quot; presses in Great Ancoats Street, moved to a new plant at Knowsley on Merseyside.

In 2011 the then editor, Colin Myler, described it as &quot;the greatest newspaper in the world&quot; as it had won four awards at the British Press Awards. The award for News Reporter of the Year, went to Mazher Mahmood, the &quot;fake sheikh&quot; who hides his identity, for his exposé of corruption in the cricketing world. The paper also won top show-business reporter and magazine of the year. It was rumoured that NotW could even win the top award, Newspaper of the Year.

=== End of publication ===
It was announced on 7 July 2011 that, after 168 years in print, the newspaper would print its final edition on 10 July 2011 following revelations of the ongoing phone hacking scandal, with the loss of 200 jobs. The paper announced that all profits from the final edition – 74 pence out of the £1 cover price – would go to &quot;good causes&quot;, and advertising space would be given to charities; the remaining 26 pence for each copy went to retailers selling the paper and to wholesalers. Shutting the newspaper cost News Group Newspapers around £240m.

The government of the United Kingdom said it had no role in the decision. James Murdoch claimed that the company was fully co-operating with ongoing police investigations.

The edition of 10 July 2011 of the &quot;News of the World&quot; carried its final headline, &quot;Thank You &amp; Goodbye&quot;, superimposed on top of a collage of past front pages. The back cover featured a quote from George Orwell&#x27;s Nineteen Eighty-Four that mentions the paper, and a recent quote from a NotW reader. The final edition also included a 48-page pullout documenting the history of the paper. On 9 July 2011, after production of the final edition wrapped, editor Colin Myler led the staff out of the building, where he held a press conference thanking the staff and its readers, concluding, &quot;In the best tradition, we are going to the pub.&quot; The paper&#x27;s final, and unattributed, editorial, stated that &quot;Phones were hacked, and for that this newspaper is truly sorry... there is no justification for this appalling wrongdoing.&quot; The final edition sold 3.8 million copies, about a million more than usual.

There was soon speculation that News International would launch a Sunday edition of &quot;The Sun&quot; to replace the &quot;News of the World&quot;, and it did, on 26 February 2012. The domain names &quot;sunonsunday.co.uk&quot;, &quot;thesunonsunday.co.uk&quot; and &quot;thesunonsunday.com&quot; were registered on 5 July 2011 by News International Newspapers Limited.

== Controversies ==
=== Imprisonment of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards (1967) ===
In early 1967, the newspaper ran a three-part feature entitled &quot;Pop Stars and Drugs: Facts That Will Shock You&quot;. The series described alleged LSD parties hosted by the Moody Blues and attended by top stars including the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend and Cream&#x27;s Ginger Baker, and alleged admissions of drug use by leading pop musicians. The first article targeted Donovan (who was raided and charged soon after); the second installment (published on 5 February) targeted the Rolling Stones. A reporter who contributed to the story spent an evening at the exclusive London club Blaise&#x27;s, where a member of the Rolling Stones allegedly took several Benzedrine tablets, displayed a piece of hashish and invited his companions back to his flat for a &quot;smoke&quot;. The article claimed that the member was singer Mick Jagger, although the reporter had in fact been eavesdropping on guitarist Brian Jones.

On 10 May 1967, Jagger, Keith Richards, and their friend art dealer Robert Fraser were arrested at Richards&#x27; Redlands estate in West Wittering and charged with possession of cannabis and amphetamines, while bandmate Jones&#x27; London house was also raided by police and he was arrested and charged with cannabis possession along with his friend Stanislas &quot;Stash&quot; Klossowski, son of French artist Balthus. Jagger and Richards were tried at the end of June. On 29 June, Jagger was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment for possession of four amphetamine tablets; Richards was found guilty of allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to one year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point, but were released on bail the next day pending appeal.

The &quot;News of the World&quot; was rapidly identified by the hippy counterculture as the prime culprit for the imprisonments, which were seen as an attempt by the Establishment to send a collective message to a hedonistic young generation. &quot;International Times&quot; and activist and musician Mick Farren organised protests outside the Fleet Street offices of the newspaper. Protesters informed the paper&#x27;s staff that their objective was &quot;freeing the fucking Stones and closing down the fucking &quot;News of the World&quot;&quot;. Farren later credited his colleague Sue Miles with identifying the paper as a target for protest because, as she put it, &quot;they were the bastards who started this&quot; (with their feature on drugs in music). Farren reported that a second night of protests was broken up by officers from City of London Police, who beat him up and made a number of arrests.

Criticism of the sentences also came from the &quot;News of the World&quot;&#x27;s future sister publication &quot;The Times&quot;, which ran an editorial entitled &quot;Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?&quot; in which conservative editor William Rees-Mogg surprised his readers by his unusually critical discourse on the sentencing, pointing out that Jagger had been treated far more harshly for a minor first offense than &quot;any purely anonymous young man&quot;. On 31 July, the appeals court overturned Richards&#x27; conviction, and Jagger&#x27;s sentence was reduced to a conditional discharge. Brian Jones&#x27; trial took place in November 1967; in December, after appealing the original prison sentence, Jones was fined £1,000, put on three years&#x27; probation and ordered to seek professional help.

Commenting on the closure in 2011 of the newspaper against which he had led protests 44 years earlier, Farren was in triumphant mood: 

=== &quot;Chequebook&quot; journalism ===
The paper became notorious for chequebook journalism, as it was often discovered attempting to buy stories, typically concerning private affairs and relationships, of people closely involved with figures of public interest such as politicians, celebrities and high-profile criminals. With this intention, the paper on occasion paid key witnesses in criminal trials such as the 1966 Moors murders case, and the 1999 trial of Gary Glitter on charges of assaulting an underage teenage fan.

=== Anti-paedophile campaign (2000) ===

The paper began a controversial campaign to name and shame alleged paedophiles in July 2000, following the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne in West Sussex. During the trial of her killer Roy Whiting, it emerged that he had a previous conviction for abduction and sexual assault against a child. The paper&#x27;s decision led to some instances of action being taken against those suspected of being child sex offenders, which included several cases of mistaken identity, including one instance where a paediatrician had her house vandalised, and another where a man was confronted because he had a neck brace similar to one a paedophile was wearing when pictured. The campaign was labelled &quot;grossly irresponsible&quot; journalism by the then-chief constable of Gloucestershire, Tony Butler.

=== Phone hacking scandal ===

From the nineties until the newspaper’s demise in 2011, reporters at the paper used private investigators to illegally gain access to hundreds of mobile phone voicemail accounts held by a variety of people of interest to the newspaper. In 2007 the paper&#x27;s royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, pleaded guilty to illegal interception of personal communication and was jailed for four months; the paper&#x27;s editor, Andy Coulson, had resigned two weeks earlier. In 2009/2010, further revelations emerged on the extent of the phone hacking, and how it was common knowledge within the &quot;News of the World&quot; and its News International parent. According to a former reporter at the paper, &quot;Everyone knew. The office cat knew&quot;, about the illegal activities used to scoop stories. On 17 January 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator paid by the paper, testified that he had been asked by the newspaper&#x27;s leadership to hack voicemail accounts on its behalf. In April 2011, attorneys for the victims alleged that as many as 7,000 people had their phones hacked by the &quot;News of the World&quot;; it was further revealed that the paper&#x27;s owner, Rupert Murdoch, had attempted to pressure Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Labour Party MPs to &quot;back away&quot; from investigating the scandal. Three journalists on the newspaper were initially arrested: Ian Edmondson and Neville Thurlbeck on 5 April and James Weatherup on 14 April. The newspaper &quot;unreservedly&quot; apologised for its phone hacking activities during April 2011. On 4 July 2011, it was disclosed that potential evidence had been deleted in spring 2002 from the hacked voicemail account of Milly Dowler, then missing, but later found to have been murdered.

=== 2006 reward for information on murders ===
On 13 December 2006, the newspaper announced that it was offering a record-breaking reward of £250,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the murders of five prostitutes around Ipswich, Suffolk. The reward went unclaimed; Steve Wright was arrested on suspicion of murder six days later following the use of unrelated information to link him to the murders. He was found guilty of all five murders at his trial 14 months later and sentenced to life imprisonment.

=== The Victoria Beckham &#x27;kidnap plot&#x27; ===
In 2002, Mazher Mahmood, an undercover reporter working for the &quot;News of the World&quot;, also known as the Fake Sheikh, allegedly exposed a plot to kidnap Victoria Beckham. Five men were arrested but the trial later collapsed when it emerged News of the World had paid its main witness Florim Gashi £10,000 to work with Mazher Mahmood. Florim Gashi later admitted working with Mahmood to set up the kidnap plot. This led to an investigation by Scotland Yard on News of the World called Operation Canopus.

=== &quot;Fake sheikh&quot; cricket scandal ===

In August 2010, Mahmood posed as the &quot;Fake Sheikh&quot; to expose a cricket bookie named Mazhar Majeed who claimed Pakistani cricketers had committed spot-fixing during Pakistan&#x27;s 2010 tour of England. In November 2011, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif were found guilty by a London court on criminal charges relating to spot-fixing. Mohammad Amir and Majeed had entered guilty pleas on the same charges.

=== Links to police corruption ===
In a September 2010 interview broadcast on 7 July 2011 on the BBC Radio 4 news programme &quot;The World at One&quot;, former &quot;News of the World&quot; features editor Paul McMullan made an admission relating to police corruption. He told of having used material obtained by a colleague&#x27;s bribery of a police officer as the basis of a series of articles published over several years on Jennifer Elliott, the daughter of the actor Denholm Elliott. He stated, &quot;The going rate for that kind of thing might have been two to five hundred pounds and that would have been authorised, and he [i.e., the police officer] would have been paid... and he would have been on the lookout for another story...&quot; The articles described Elliott&#x27;s destitute situation and stated that she had worked as a prostitute. Jennifer Elliott took her own life in 2003. In McMullan&#x27;s opinion, the &quot;News of the World&quot; – specifically, his own articles – contributed significantly to her suicide. In 2011, the paper knowingly used private investigators to gain stories from corrupt police officers.

=== Libel actions ===

* In 1988, the parents of actor David Scarboro, who played Mark Fowler on the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, commenced libel proceedings with solicitor Michael Shelton due to the hounding of Scarboro whilst he suffered from mental illness. During this time the &quot;News of the World&quot; and its sister paper &quot;The Sun&quot; published stories calling Scarboro a &quot;zombie&quot; as well as &quot;Dracula&quot; and purported that he took cocaine. According to the parents this escalated Scarboro&#x27;s depression resulting in his suicide on 27 April 1988. Due to the suicide the libel action was forced to cease.
* In 2005, British television personality Ahmed Aghil won an apology from the &quot;News of the World&quot; in a libel case.
* In 2005, England footballer David Beckham and his wife Victoria brought a legal action against the paper seeking libel damages over an article that carried the headline &quot;Posh and Becks on the Rocks&quot;; suggesting that their marriage was under pressure. The legal action was withdrawn in 2006 and &quot;resolved on a confidential basis&quot;, according to the couple&#x27;s spokeswoman Jo Milloy.
* In April 2006, England footballer Wayne Rooney received £100,000 in damages from the publishers of the &quot;News of the World&quot; and its sister paper &quot;The Sun&quot; over articles falsely reporting he had slapped his fiancée Coleen McLoughlin.
* In June 2006, England footballer Ashley Cole received an estimated minimum £100,000 in damages from the publishers of the &quot;News of the World&quot; and its sister paper &quot;The Sun&quot;. The &quot;News of the World&quot; had published a false story about two footballers having a gay orgy with a DJ; while not naming any of them, it used a pixelated photograph of Cole to illustrate the story.
* In July 2006, Scottish politician Tommy Sheridan initiated a libel case against the &quot;News of the World&quot; in Edinburgh. Sheridan denied allegations, made by the newspaper in November 2004 and January 2005, that he had an affair, engaged in group sex and attended a swinger&#x27;s club in Manchester. Sheridan won the case and was awarded £200,000 in damages. The newspaper appealed against the jury&#x27;s decision, and refused to pay out the money; Sheridan and his wife Gail were charged with perjury; the court case commenced on 4 October 2010. Charges against Gail Sheridan were dropped and she was acquitted on 17 December 2010. Sheridan was subsequently convicted on 23 December 2010. The case was the longest perjury trial in Scottish history.
* In 2008 in the invasion of privacy case &quot;Mosley v News Group Newspapers Limited&quot; the President of the FIA Max Mosley challenged the &quot;News of the World&quot; which had alleged on 30 March 2008 that he had been involved in a sadomasochistic sex act involving several female prostitutes, when they published a video of the incident recorded by one of the women, and published details of the incident. The case resulted in Mosley being awarded £60,000 in damages.
* In 2009 Barry George, a man who had been falsely convicted of murdering television presenter Jill Dando, won a libel claim filed against the publisher of the &quot;News of the World&quot; after the paper fabricated quotes to suggest he had stalked other women.
* In January 2010, Norwich City Football Club started legal proceedings against the &quot;News of the World&quot; after they published an article, &quot;Canaries on Brink&quot; on 24 January 2010 claiming that the club had begun the processes of going into administration.
* In February 2010, actor Brad Pitt and his partner, actress Angelina Jolie made plans to sue the &quot;News of the World&quot; after it published allegations about their relationship.
* In June 2011, the UK Press Complaint Commission (PCC) gave Yasir Hameed, a Pakistani cricketer, a victory by ordering the &quot;News of the World&quot; to remove a video and story about him from its website.
* Also in 2011, Polish footballer Artur Boruc won an out-of-court settlement against the &quot;News of the World&quot; after the newspaper made false allegations that he was unfaithful to his girlfriend. Boruc was paid £70,000 and a full apology was issued.

<text>(&#x27;right of the lord&#x27;), also known as (&#x27;right of the first night&#x27;), sometimes referred to as &quot;prima nocta&quot;, was a supposed legal right in medieval Europe, allowing feudal lords to have sexual relations with any female subject, particularly on her wedding night.

There are many references to the alleged custom throughout the centuries.

== Terminology ==
The French expression translates as &quot;right of the lord&quot;, but modern French usage prefers (, from , &#x27;leg&#x27;) or, more commonly, (, from , &#x27;thigh&#x27;).

The term is often used synonymously with , Latin for &quot;right of the first night&quot;.

== Ancient times ==
The Greek historian Herodotus mentions a similar custom among the Adyrmachidae in ancient Libya: &quot;They are also the only tribe with whom the custom obtains of bringing all women about to become brides before the king, that he may choose such as are agreeable to him.&quot;

When the plebeians of the Etruscan city of Volsinii rebelled against the aristocrats in 280 BC, &quot;They took their wives for themselves and placed the daughters of the nobles under the , while all their former masters on whom they could lay hands were tortured to death.&quot;

It is also mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Ketubot 3b תיבעל להגמון (tibael lehegmon), regarding a decree imposed on the Jewish community by a Syrian-Greek ruler, in which all Jewish brides were taken before their wedding.

== Middle Ages ==
=== Europe ===
The medieval marriage fine or merchet has sometimes been interpreted as a payment for the to be waived. Alternatively, it has been interpreted as compensation to the lord for the young women leaving his lands. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states that the evidence indicates it was a monetary tax related to vassal marriages, since a considerable number of seigneurial rights revolved around marriage.

A similar payment to church authorities has also been interpreted as relating to the . However, according to British scholar W. D. Howarth, the Catholic Church at some times prohibited consummation of a marriage on the first night. The payment was for an indulgence from the church to waive this prohibition.

In the Wooing of Emer in Irish mythology the King Conchobar has the &quot;droit du seigneur&quot; over all marriages of his subjects. He is afraid of Cú Chulainn&#x27;s reaction if he exercises it in this case, but is equally afraid of losing his authority if he does not. The druid Cathbad suggests a solution: Conchobar sleeps with Emer on the night of the wedding, but Cathbad sleeps between them.

The biography of Gerald of Aurillac written by Odo of Cluny (879–942) gives an account of the young nobleman demanding to rape one of his serfs, only to have the act averted by a miracle, sending Gerald on the road to sainthood. American historian Vern Bullough suggested that this illustrates that such behaviour was commonplace in the period, and that the &quot;legend [of ] reflected the reality&quot;.

In the 14th-century French epic poem , a tyrannical lord claims the unless he receives part of the bride&#x27;s dowry.

The only Medieval legal document to mention this practice is Article 9 of Ferdinand II of Aragon&#x27;s in 1486, in which the king forbids lords from sleeping with a new bride of a peasant. However, this Article does not suggest that such a right actually existed, as Article 9 lists various abuses that do not derive from any earlier seignorial rights. Furthermore, in an earlier draft document related to the &quot;Sentencia&quot;, the Catalan lords replied that they doubted that any lord had actually demanded such a practice.

== Post-medieval references ==
=== Europe ===

==== Baltics ====
Personal memoirs from early 19th century Western Estonia claim widespread use of the rule of first night; whether it was a fully legal right is not elaborated 

==== England ====
In Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; () the rebel Jack Cade proclaims: &quot;there shall not a maid be married, but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it&quot;. According to the French scholar Alain Boureau, Cade was demanding the payment of merchet, not the right of first night. Howarth states that Cade&#x27;s payment was simply the lord&#x27;s compensation for a serf who departed to get married, and had no connection with any sexual &quot;right&quot; to maidens.

The English lexicographer Thomas Blount claimed in his of 1679 that the &quot;right&quot; had previously existed as a medieval custom of some English manors, but had been commuted into payment of money. However, Howarth points out that there is no evidence that Blount&#x27;s theory actually reflected the medieval situation.

&quot;The Curiosities of Literature&quot; (1823) by the British writer Isaac D&#x27;Israeli claimed the practice had been widespread across Europe.

==== France ====
The supposed right was mentioned in 1556 in the of the French lawyer and author Jean Papon. Papon&#x27;s account was vague about attributing where this practice is said to have occurred. The French writer Antoine du Verdier also commented on it in 1577, saying that he had been told that such a right had once existed in Scotland.

The French philosopher Montesquieu referred to the practice in &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; (1748), saying that it had been enforced in France over three nights, although this was a misinterpretation of the actual medieval practice whereby consummation of marriage was forbidden for the first or first three nights of a marriage, unless waived by buying an indulgence from a bishop or abbot.

Voltaire mentioned the practice in his , published in 1764. He wrote the five-act comedy or in 1762, although it was not performed until 1779, after his death. This play was the first time the term was used.

In 19th-century France, a number of writers made other claims about the supposed power of the overlords during the Ancien Régime, such as the (right of ravage; providing to the lord the right to devastate fields of his own domain), and the (right of lounging; it was said that a lord had the right to disembowel his serfs to warm his feet in).

==== The Holy Roman Empire ====
In Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, which premiered in 1786 with a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte, the comic plot revolves around the successful efforts of the young bride and groom, Susanna and Figaro, to block the efforts of the unfaithful Count Almaviva to seduce Susanna. To achieve his aim, the frustrated Count threatens to reinstitute . It was based on a play of the same title by Pierre Beaumarchais.

==== Netherlands ====
The (&quot;Acts of the Saints&quot;), published from 1643 onwards, mentions the in the hagiographies of St Margaret and St Forannan.

==== Scotland ====
In 1527, the Scottish historian Hector Boece wrote that the &quot;right&quot; had existed in Scotland until abolished by Malcolm III ( 1058–93) under the influence of his wife, Margaret (later St Margaret of Scotland). The payment of merchet was instituted in its place. Boece attributed the law to a legendary king, Ewen or Evenus III. The modern French scholar Alain Boureau says that Boece probably invented King Ewen, but he views this as mythology, not as a polemic against medieval barbarism.

Other Scottish scholars of his era quoted Boece with approval, including John Lesley (1578), George Buchanan (1582), and Habbakuk Bisset (1626). The historical existence of the custom in Scotland was also accepted in Scottish legal works such as James Balfour&#x27;s &quot;Practicks&quot; (), John Skene&#x27;s (1597), and Thomas Craig&#x27;s (1603). The English scholar Henry Spelman stated in his &quot;Glossary&quot; (1664) that the custom had existed in Scotland, but not in England. The English jurist William Blackstone cited Boece&#x27;s statement in his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; (1765–1769), while similarly noting that the custom had never existed in England. In 1776, the Scottish jurist David Dalrymple disputed the existence of the custom, arguing Boece&#x27;s account was purely legendary, but his position was often seen as based on Scottish patriotism. However, according to the Scottish legal scholar David Maxwell Walker, instances have been recorded of the being claimed up to the 18th century. Walker concluded that it is possible that the existed as a custom in Scotland, dependent on the attitude of the king, and survived longer in remote regions.

After their travels in Scotland in 1773, Samuel Johnson and James Boswell documented the custom of the payment of merchet, linking it with the &quot;right of first night&quot;. They paralleled it with that custom of Borough English, suggesting that the English custom favored the youngest son because the paternity of the eldest son was doubtful. Sir Walter Scott mentioned the custom in his historical Scottish novel, &quot;The Fair Maid of Perth&quot; (1828).

==== Spain ====
The Spanish novel (&quot;The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda&quot;, 1617) by Miguel de Cervantes contains an episode where a bride and groom escape a barbaric marriage custom in Ireland. According to the British scholar W.D. Howarth, Cervantes was inspired by Peruvian marriage ceremonies and what is described is different from the classic version of the as it involves multiple virgins. However, Cervantes&#x27; story was a source for the English play &quot;The Custom of the Country&quot;, written by John Fletcher and Philip Massinger and published in 1647. The play has the classic version of the &quot;right of first night&quot; with money payment as an alternative. According to Howarth, this suggests that was a familiar notion to people at that time, which he traces back to Boece.

=== Africa ===
In modern times, Zaire&#x27;s president Mobutu Sese Seko appropriated the when traveling around the country, where local chiefs offered him virgins.

=== North America ===
The term has also been used to describe the sexual exploitation of slaves in the United States.

=== Asia ===
As late as the 19th century, some Kurdish chieftains in Anatolia raped Armenian brides on their wedding night (part of what was then known as the or system).

=== Oceania ===
In the Hawaiian Islands, the privilege for chiefs was often observed, according to &quot;Sexual Behavior in Pre Contact Hawai&#x27;i&quot; by Milton Diamond. A young girl&#x27;s parents viewed the coupling with favor. This is because the girl might conceive the chief&#x27;s child and be allowed to keep it.

== Debate in the 19th and 20th centuries ==
Scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries gave the historical basis of the &quot;right of first night&quot; a good deal of attention. Historians David M. Walker and Hector McKechnie wrote that the right might have existed in medieval Europe, but other historians have concluded that it is a myth, and that all references to it are from later periods. Over time, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and the Larousse encyclopedias dramatically changed their opinion on the topic, moving from acceptance to rejection of the historical veracity of the idea. French writer Louis Veuillot wrote a book in 1854 disputing its existence. After an exhaustive historical study, German jurist Karl Schmidt concluded in 1881 that it was a scholarly misconception. After Schmidt, many of those who believed in the existence of the custom based their opinions on anthropological studies of tribal societies, though according to W. D. Howarth, this was a misguided argument because of the disparity between the tribal societies and medieval European society.

In &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot; in 1884, socialist Friedrich Engels argued it was real and had an anthropological origin. In 1910, the Celtic scholar Whitley Stokes said that the existence of the practice was &quot;evidenced though not proved&quot; to have existed in Ireland. In 1930, Scottish legal scholar Hector McKechnie concluded, based on historical evidence, that the practice had existed in Scotland in early times. Italian scholar Paolo Mantegazza, in his 1935 book &quot;The Sexual Relations of Mankind&quot;, said that while not a law, it was most likely a binding custom.

<text>Dartington Hall in Dartington, near Totnes, Devon, England, is an historic house and country estate of dating from medieval times. The group of late 14th century buildings are Grade I listed; described in Pevsner&#x27;s Buildings of England as &quot;one of the most spectacular surviving domestic buildings of late Medieval England&quot;, along with Haddon Hall and Wingfield Manor. The medieval buildings are grouped around a huge courtyard; the largest built for a private residence before the 16th Century, and the Great Hall itself is the finest of its date in England. The west range of the courtyard is regarded nationally as one of the most notable examples of a range of medieval lodgings. The medieval buildings were restored from 1926 to 1938.

The site is the headquarters of the Dartington Trust, which currently runs a number of charitable educational programmes, including Schumacher College, Dartington Arts School, Research in Practice and the Dartington Music Summer School &amp; Festival. In addition to its own live arts and learning programmes, the Trust uses Dartington Hall to host other groups and as a venue for retreats.

== Dartington Hall estate ==

The estate was held by the Martin family between the early 12th and mid-14th centuries, but on the death of William Martin in 1326, the feudal barony of Dartington escheated to the crown and in 1384 was granted by King Richard II to his half brother John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter (c.1352–1400), created in 1388 Earl of Huntingdon and in 1397 Duke of Exeter.

===Historic buildings===
The 1st Duke built the mediaeval hall between 1388 and his death in 1400 and the sculpted arms of Richard II survive on ribbed vault of the Porch. The 1st Duke was beheaded by King Henry IV who had deposed Richard II, however Dartington continued as the seat of his son John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter (1395–1447) and grandson Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter (1430–1475) successively. On the death of the 3rd Duke in 1475 without issue, supposedly drowned at sea on the orders of King Edward IV, Dartington again escheated to the crown. In 1559 it was acquired by Sir Arthur Champernowne, Vice-Admiral of the West under Elizabeth I, whose descendants in a direct male line lived in the Hall for 366 years until 1925.
The hall was mostly derelict by the time it was bought in 1925 by the British-American millionaire couple Leonard Elmhirst (orig. from Yorkshire) and his wife Dorothy (née Whitney) from New York. They commissioned architect William Weir to renovate the medieval buildings and notably restore the Great Hall&#x27;s hammerbeam roof.

===20th century and the Dartington experiment===

The influence of Rabindranath Tagore on Leonard Elmhirst, and the interests and money of his wife Dorothy, led them to undertake an experiment in rural reconstruction at Dartington Hall. It is said that Tagore had become familiar with Dartington during his travels in England and influenced Elmhirst in his selection of the estate for purchase.

The energy and investments of the Elmhirsts and a number of significant innovations in rural regeneration became organised departments working on the estate. The innovations included &quot;the social and spiritual &quot;questing&quot; that underwrote support for peace movements, Eastern mysticism and ultimately social science; the progressive educational values that led to the founding of Dartington School; the artistic commitments that made the place an innovator in pottery and textiles and – by 1938 – a refuge for sixty or so avant-garde Continental dancers, sculptors and playwrights; and the agricultural ventures which, if never profitable, became a seedbed for research.&quot;

In 1928, Leonard Elmirst began collaborating with Alice Blinn, who worked for Delineator Home Institute to create a home economics training centre and modernise domestic activities of the village. Blinn recommended initiatives including education, apprenticeship programmes, a laboratory, a modern kitchen, cafeteria, laundry, and lavatories, based on what was available in a modern American home. Unable to persuade Blinn to move to England, Elmhirst abandoned the plan. Blinn&#x27;s recommended kitchen equipment was installed but arranged in a typical English fashion because the headmaster&#x27;s wife did not like the design.

In 1935, the Dartington Hall Trust, a registered charity, was set up in order to run the estate.

High Cross House was built in 1932 as a home for the headmaster of Dartington Hall school. It was designed by Swiss-American architect William Lescaze and is now regarded as an important modernist building. It is Grade II* listed.

Aller Park, the original Dartington Hall School, was built 1929–31 and designed by Ides Van Der Gracht of the New York firm of Delano and Aldrish. Intended as a junior school, it was built in a lavish Americanised Tudor style. Soon afterwards came Foxhole, the senior school built 1931–32, and boarding houses Blacklers (1933), Chimmels (1934) and Orchards (1935) in a straightforward modern idiom. A modern extension was added to Orchards, and a drama hall built nearby – both of 1964. East of the medieval Hall an arts centre and dance school with a large hall was built 1930–32, with several additions in 1938 and 1966. To the North of the Hall, Higher Close Students Centre was built in 1963 adjacent to the present main car park. Huxhams Cross and Broom Park were built 1932 as estate workers houses. At Shinners Bridge is the central Office of the estate (1935) and the Sawmill (1931–32). The Cider Press Centre was built 1976 for the growing tourist trade.

=== The estate today ===
In addition to historic buildings the estate has a number of legacy 20th century buildings from the Elmhirst&#x27;s social enterprises, including the defunct Dartington Hall School, which closed in 1987, and High Cross House which is now a base for Dartington Trust&#x27;s teaching staff and academics. Other buildings are being used by various departments at the Trust, including the Old Postern which is home to Schumacher College, and other buildings around the Hall which host the Arts at Dartington, the Dartington Music Summer School &amp; Festival, and Research in Practice. The Cider Press Centre, a shopping centre at Shinners Bridge, is also run by the Trust.

In September 2022, undergraduate students returned to Dartington estate with the launch of the BSc Regenerative Food and Farming, the first degree in England to focus specifically on sustainable approaches to agriculture.

The Hall and medieval courtyard functions in part as a conference centre and wedding venue and provides bed and breakfast accommodation for people attending courses and for casual visitors. The Barn Cinema and the White Hart Bar and Restaurant are used by estate dwellers, residents from the surrounding countryside, and visitors alike.

In North Devon, the Beaford Centre was set up as an arts centre by the Dartington Trust in the 1960s to bring employment and culture to a rurally depressed area. With similar social objectives, the Trust established the Dartington Crystal factory at Great Torrington in June 1967 under the name of Dartington Glass.

== Dartington Music Summer School &amp; Festival ==
Dartington Music Summer School &amp; Festival is a department of the Dartington Trust. It is both a festival and a music school with an &quot;ethos of bringing together top-quality performers and composers to work with students and amateur musicians in concerts and classes in a relaxed, informal atmosphere.&quot; Participants, both amateur musicians and advanced students, spend the daytime studying a variety of different musical courses, and the evenings attending (or performing in) concerts. In addition to instrumental and vocal masterclasses, there are courses at various levels on subjects such as composition, opera, chamber music, conducting and improvisation. Courses include choirs, orchestras, individual masterclasses, and non classical music such as Jazz, Salsa and Gamelan. Composition teachers have included Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies, Brian Ferneyhough, Witold Lutosławski and Elliott Carter.

== Dartington Gardens ==
The gardens were created by Dorothy Elmhirst with the involvement of major landscape designers Beatrix Farrand and Percy Cane and feature a tiltyard (thought actually to be the remains of an Elizabethan water garden) and major sculptures, including examples by Henry Moore, Willi Soukop and Peter Randall-Page. There is an ancient yew tree (&quot;Taxus baccata&quot;) reputed to be nearly 2000 years old and legend has it that Knights Templar are buried in the graveyard there, although there is no evidence to substantiate this.

== Former activities ==

===Dartington Hall School===

Dartington Hall School, founded in 1926, offered a progressive coeducational boarding life. When it started there was a minimum of formal classroom activity and the children learned by involvement in estate activities. It was to have &quot;no corporal punishment, indeed no punishment at all; no prefects; no uniforms; no Officers&#x27; Training Corps; no segregation of the sexes; no compulsory games, compulsory religion or compulsory anything else, no more Latin, no more Greek; no competition; no jingoism.&quot;

With time more academic rigour was imposed, but it remained progressive and had mixed success educating the children, sometimes the more wayward ones, of the fee-paying parents. A noted alumnus was Lord Young, a founder of &quot;Which?&quot; and the Open University. Lucian Freud attended the school for two years and his brother Clement Freud was also a pupil there. Other noted alumni include Eva Ibbotson, songwriter Kit Hain, Ivan Moffat, Jasper Fforde, Sheila Ernst, Lionel Grigson, Miriam Gross, Martin Bernal, Matthew Huxley, Max Fordham, Oliver Postgate, Richard Leacock, Jasia Reichardt, Nicolas Rea and the sculptor Sokari Douglas Camp.

Son of the founders, Michael Straight, also attended the school. Straight later attended Cambridge and became a speechwriter to Franklin D Roosevelt, and after the war, publisher of the &quot;New Republic&quot;, a magazine which the Whitney family owned. In his memoir &quot;After Long Silence&quot;, Straight stated he had been recruited as a Communist agent by Cambridge spy Anthony Blunt, but had become disillusioned with the Party after the war.

W. B. Curry was headmaster of the school from 1931 to 1957, and wrote two books about it, &quot;The School&quot;, published by The Bodley Head in 1934, and &quot;Education for Sanity&quot;, published by Heinemann in 1947.

The author Dennis Wheatley novelised the activities of some people based at the school in his 1947 book &quot;The Haunting of Toby Jugg&quot;. This was a supernatural thriller which sensationalised some real-life events before the war, setting them at a fictional school called &quot;Weylands&quot;. Years later, it was revealed that these events had attracted the attention of MI5 in a declassified report called &quot;The Case Against Dartington Hall&quot;.

At its peak, the school had some 300 pupils. However, with the advent of state-based progressive education, the death of its founders, and the appointment of a new headmaster in whose time the school attracted considerable negative publicity – not least owing to his calling the police to the school to combat alcohol and drug abuse taking place, the death by drowning of a student, and his wife&#x27;s modelling for pornographic photographs – the school suffered a dramatic drop in recruitment. The school was forced to close in 1987. After the school&#x27;s closure, a number of staff and students set up Sands School which still carries some of the principles that Dartington once had.

It has been suggested that the school &#x27;Knotshead&#x27; in the novel &quot;A Private Place&quot; by Amanda Craig was based upon Dartington Hall school, as the events in the book are similar to those that occurred within the final years of Dartington Hall.

Literary editor Miriam Gross wrote an account of her time at the school in her memoir, and also published in the May 2011 edition of &quot;Standpoint&quot; magazine.

===Tagore===
Inspired by a long association with Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s Shantiniketan, where Tagore was trying to introduce progressive education and rural reconstruction into a tribal community, the Elmhirsts set out in the 1920s on a similar goal for the depressed agricultural economy in rural England.

In May 2010, Sotheby&#x27;s sold a group of 12 paintings by Rabindranath Tagore, which had been given by Tagore to Leonard Elmhirst. In Autumn 2011, The Trust proposed the sale of additional artworks by Ben Nicholson, Christopher Wood, Alfred Wallis and others, again at Sotheby&#x27;s. The sale generated some criticism from local people, who voiced concerns about deaccessioning of the Trust&#x27;s art assets. The Trust argued that the founders went to considerable lengths to make clear that art works and other assets could and should be used and sold at the discretion of the Trustees to support the activities of the Trust.

===Dartington College of Arts===
Dartington College of Arts was a specialist arts institution based at the hall from 1961 to 2010, with an international reputation for excellence, focusing mainly on the performance arts. In 2008, it became part of University College Falmouth and subsequently relocated to Falmouth, Cornwall. In 2021, the Trust re-opened the Dartington Arts School with five new Masters programmes, including Arts and Place, Arts and Ecology and Poetics of Imagination.

<text>The mallard () or wild duck (Anas platyrhynchos) is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout the temperate and subtropical Americas, Eurasia, and North Africa. It has been introduced to New Zealand, Australia, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, the Falkland Islands, and South Africa. Belonging to the subfamily Anatinae of the waterfowl family Anatidae, mallards live in wetlands, eat water plants and small animals, and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks of varying sizes.

Males (drakes) have green heads, while the females (hens) have mainly brown-speckled plumage. Both sexes have an area of white-bordered black or iridescent purple or blue feathers called a speculum on their wings; males especially tend to have blue speculum feathers. The mallard is long, of which the body makes up around two-thirds the length. The wingspan is and the bill is long. It is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks, weighing .

The female lays 8 to 13 creamy white to greenish-buff spotless eggs, on alternate days. Incubation takes 27 to 28 days and fledging takes 50 to 60 days. The ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming as soon as they hatch.

The non-migratory mallard interbreeds with indigenous wild ducks of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. This species is the main ancestor of most breeds of domestic duck, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool has been genetically polluted by the domestic and feral mallard populations.

The mallard is considered to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and, unlike many waterfowl, are considered an invasive species in some regions. It is a very adaptable species, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development.

== Taxonomy and evolutionary history ==
The mallard was one of the many bird species originally described in the 1758 10thedition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by Carl Linnaeus. He gave it two binomial names: &quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot; and &quot;Anas boschas&quot;. The latter was generally preferred until 1906 when Einar Lönnberg established that &quot;A.platyrhynchos&quot; had priority, as it appeared on an earlier page in the text. The scientific name comes from Latin &quot;Anas&quot;, &quot;duck&quot; and Ancient Greek πλατυρυγχος, &quot;platyrhynchus&quot;, &quot;broad-billed&quot; (from πλατύς, &quot;platys&quot;, &quot;broad&quot; and ρυγχός, &quot;rhunkhos&quot;, &quot;bill&quot;). The genome of &quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot; was sequenced in 2013.

The name &quot;mallard&quot; originally referred to any wild drake, and it is sometimes still used this way. It was derived from the Old French &#x27; or &#x27; for &quot;wild drake&quot; although its true derivation is unclear. It may be related to, or at least influenced by, an Old High German masculine proper name &quot;&quot;, clues lying in the alternative English forms &quot;maudelard&quot; and &quot;mawdelard&quot;. &quot;Masle&quot; (male) has also been proposed as an influence.

Mallards frequently interbreed with their closest relatives in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. The mallard has hybridised with more than 40 species in the wild, and an additional 20 species in captivity, though fertile hybrids typically have two &quot;Anas&quot; parents. Mallards and their domestic conspecifics are fully interfertile; many wild mallard populations in North America contain significant amounts of domestic mallard DNA.

Genetic analysis has shown that certain mallards appear to be closer to their Indo-Pacific relatives, while others are related to their American relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggest that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without a good candidate for a local predecessor species. The large Ice Age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and West Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named &quot;Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas&quot;.Mallards are differentiated in their mitochondrial DNA between North American and Eurasian populations, but the nuclear genome displays a notable lack of genetic structure. Haplotypes typical of American mallard relatives and eastern spot-billed ducks can be found in mallards around the Bering Sea. The Aleutian Islands hold a population of mallards that appear to be evolving towards becoming a subspecies, as gene flow with other populations is very limited.

Also, the paucity of morphological differences between the Old World mallards and the New World mallard demonstrates the extent to which the genome is shared among them such that birds like the Chinese spot-billed duck are highly similar to the Old World mallard, and birds such as the Hawaiian duck are highly similar to the New World mallard.

The size of the mallard varies clinally; for example, birds from Greenland, though larger, have smaller bills, paler plumage, and stockier bodies than birds further south and are sometimes classified as a separate subspecies, the Greenland mallard (&quot;A.p.conboschas&quot;).

==Description==
The mallard is a medium-sized waterfowl species that is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks. It is longof which the body makes up around two-thirdshas a wingspan of , and weighs . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is , and the tarsus is .The breeding male mallard is unmistakable, with a glossy bottle-green head and a white collar that demarcates the head and neck from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, with that of the female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe. Mallards, like other sexually-dimorphic birds, can sometimes go though spontaneous sex reversal, often caused by damaged or nonfunctioning sex organs, such as the ovaries in mallard hens. This phenomenon can cause female mallards to exhibit male plumage, and vice versa (phenotypic feminisation or masculinisation).

Both male and female mallards have distinct iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) all the way to the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling&#x27;s plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. The duckling is able to fly 50–60 days after hatching. Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.

Several species of duck have brown-plumaged females that can be confused with the female mallard. The female gadwall (&quot;Mareca strepera&quot;) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the American black duck (&quot;A.rubripes&quot;), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (&quot;A.fulvigula&quot;), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.
In captivity, domestic ducks come in wild-type plumages, white, and other colours. Most of these colour variants are also known in domestic mallards not bred as livestock, but kept as pets, aviary birds, etc., where they are rare but increasing in availability.

A noisy species, the female has the deep &quot;quack&quot; stereotypically associated with ducks. The female will often call with a sequence of 2–10 &quot;quacks&quot; in a row, starting loud and with the volume gradually decreasing. Male mallards make a sound phonetically similar to that of the female, a typical &quot;quack&quot;, but it is deeper and quieter compared to that of the female. Research conducted by Middlesex University on two English mallard populations found that the vocalisations of the mallard varies depending on their environment and have something akin to a regional accent, with urban mallards in London being much louder and more vociferous compared to rural mallards in Cornwall, serving as an adaptation to persistent levels of anthropogenic noise.

When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. This maternal vocalisation is highly attractive to their young. The repetition and frequency modulation of these &quot;quacks&quot; form the auditory basis for species identification in offspring, a process known as acoustic conspecific identification. In addition, females hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.

The mallard is a rare example of both Allen&#x27;s Rule and Bergmann&#x27;s Rule in birds. Bergmann&#x27;s Rule, which states that polar forms tend to be larger than related ones from warmer climates, has numerous examples in birds, as in case of the Greenland mallard which is larger than the mallards further south. Allen&#x27;s Rule says that appendages like ears tend to be smaller in polar forms to minimise heat loss, and larger in tropical and desert equivalents to facilitate heat diffusion, and that the polar taxa are stockier overall. Examples of this rule in birds are rare as they lack external ears, but the bill of ducks is supplied with a few blood vessels to prevent heat loss, and, as in the Greenland mallard, the bill is smaller than that of birds farther south, illustrating the rule.

Due to the variability of the mallard&#x27;s genetic code, which gives it its vast interbreeding capability, mutations in the genes that decide plumage colour are very common and have resulted in a wide variety of hybrids, such as Brewer&#x27;s duck (mallard × gadwall, &quot;Mareca strepera&quot;).

== Distribution and habitat ==

The mallard is widely distributed across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres; in North America its range extends from southern and central Alaska to Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, across the Palearctic, from Iceland and southern Greenland and parts of Morocco (North Africa) in the west, Scandinavia and Britain to the north, and to Siberia, Japan, and South Korea. Also in the east, it ranges to south-eastern and south-western Australia and New Zealand in the Southern hemisphere. It is strongly migratory in the northern parts of its breeding range, and winters farther south. For example, in North America, it winters south to the southern United States and northern Mexico, but also regularly strays into Central America and the Caribbean between September and May. A drake later named &quot;Trevor&quot; attracted media attention in 2018 when it turned up on the island of Niue, an atypical location for mallards.

The mallard inhabits a wide range of habitats and climates, from the Arctic tundra to subtropical regions. It is found in both fresh- and salt-water wetlands, including parks, small ponds, rivers, lakes and estuaries, as well as shallow inlets and open sea within sight of the coastline. Water depths of less than are preferred, with birds avoiding areas more than a few metres deep. They are attracted to bodies of water with aquatic vegetation.

==Behaviour==
===Feeding===
The mallard is omnivorous and very flexible in its choice of food. Its diet may vary based on several factors, including the stage of the breeding cycle, short-term variations in available food, nutrient availability, and interspecific and intraspecific competition. The majority of the mallard&#x27;s diet seems to be made up of gastropods, insects (including beetles, flies, lepidopterans, dragonflies, and caddisflies), crustaceans, other arthropods, worms, feces of other birds, many varieties of seeds and plant matter, and roots and tubers. During the breeding season, male birds were recorded to have eaten 37.6% animal matter and 62.4% plant matter, most notably the grass &quot;Echinochloa crus-galli&quot;, and nonlaying females ate 37.0% animal matter and 63.0% plant matter, while laying females ate 71.9% animal matter and only 28.1% plant matter. Plants generally make up the larger part of a bird&#x27;s diet, especially during autumn migration and in the winter.

The mallard usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing; there are reports of it eating frogs, other amphibians, and fish, including carcasses. However, in 2017 a flock of mallards in Romania were observed hunting fledglings of small migratory birds when they land in the water, which included a grey wagtail and a black redstart. This was the first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as &quot;sordes&quot;.

===Breeding===
Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) until the female lays eggs at the start of the nesting season, which is around the beginning of spring. At this time she is left by the male who joins up with other males to await the moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere). During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch) or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.

Nesting sites are typically on the ground, hidden in vegetation where the female&#x27;s speckled plumage serves as effective camouflage, but female mallards have also been known to nest in hollows in trees, boathouses, roof gardens and on balconies, sometimes resulting in hatched offspring having difficulty following their parent to water. Egg clutches number 8–13 creamy white to greenish-buff eggs free of speckles. They measure about in length and in width. The eggs are laid on alternate days, and incubation begins when the clutch is almost complete. Incubation takes 27–28days and fledging takes 50–60days. The ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming as soon as they hatch. However, filial imprinting compels them to instinctively stay near the mother, not only for warmth and protection but also to learn about and remember their habitat as well as how and where to forage for food. Though adoptions are known to occur, female mallards typically do not tolerate stray ducklings near their broods, and will violently attack and drive away any unfamiliar young, sometimes going as far as to kill them.

When ducklings mature into flight-capable juveniles, they learn about and remember their traditional migratory routes (unless they are born and raised in captivity). In New Zealand, where mallards are naturalised, the nesting season has been found to be longer, eggs and clutches are larger and nest survival is generally greater compared with mallards in their native range.

In cases where a nest or brood fails, some mallards may mate for a second time in an attempt to raise a second clutch, typically around early-to-mid summer. In addition, mallards may occasionally breed during the autumn in cases of unseasonably warm weather; one such instance of a &#x27;late&#x27; clutch occurred in November 2011, in which a female successfully hatched and raised a clutch of eleven ducklings at the London Wetland Centre.
During the breeding season, both male and female mallards can become aggressive, driving off competitors to themselves or their mate by charging at them. Males tend to fight more than females and attack each other by repeatedly pecking at their rival&#x27;s chest, ripping out feathers and even skin on rare occasions. Female mallards are also known to carry out &#x27;inciting displays&#x27;, which encourage other ducks in the flock to begin fighting. It is possible that this behaviour allows the female to evaluate the strength of potential partners.

The drakes that end up being left out after the others have paired off with mating partners sometimes target an isolated female duck, even one of a different species, and proceed to chase and peck at her until she weakens, at which point the males take turns copulating with the female. Lebret (1961) calls this behaviour &quot;Attempted Rape Flight&quot;, and Stanley Cramp and K.E.L. Simmons (1977) speak of &quot;rape-intent flights&quot;. Male mallards also occasionally chase other male ducks of a different species, and even each other, in the same way. In one documented case of &quot;homosexual necrophilia&quot;, a male mallard copulated with another male he was chasing after the chased male died upon flying into a glass window. This paper was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 2003.

Mallards are opportunistically targeted by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs of the host mallard, but the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying.

==Predators and threats==

In addition to human hunting, mallards of all ages (but especially young ones) and in all locations must contend with a wide diversity of predators including raptors and owls, mustelids, corvids, snakes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, turtles, large fish, felids, and canids, the last two including domestic cats and dogs. The most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;; which most often pick off brooding females) and the faster or larger birds of prey, (e.g. peregrine falcons, &quot;Aquila&quot; or &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; eagles). In North America, adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey, from northern harriers (&quot;Circus hudsonius&quot;) and short-eared owls (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;) (both smaller than a mallard) to huge bald (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) and golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), and about a dozen species of mammalian predators, not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings.

Mallards are also preyed upon by other waterside apex predators, such as grey herons (&quot;Ardea cinerea&quot;), great blue herons (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;) and black-crowned night herons (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;), the European herring gull (&quot;Larus argentatus&quot;), the wels catfish (&quot;Silurus glanis&quot;), and the northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;). Crows (&quot;Corvus&quot;) are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion. Also, mallards may be attacked by larger anseriformes such as swans (&quot;Cygnus&quot;) and geese during the breeding season, and are frequently driven off by these birds over territorial disputes. Mute swans (&quot;Cygnus olor&quot;) have been known to attack or even kill mallards if they feel that the ducks pose a threat to their offspring. Common loons (&quot;Gavia inmer&quot;) are similarly territorial and aggressive towards other birds in such disputes, and will frequently drive mallards away from their territory. However, in 2019, a pair of common loons in Wisconsin were observed raising a mallard duckling for several weeks, having seemingly adopted the bird after it had been abandoned by its parents.

In summer, a combination of hot temperatures and reduced water levels place mallards at an increased risk of contracting botulism, as these conditions are ideal for &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; to propagate, with the birds also more likely to come into contact with botulinum toxin produced by the bacteria. Outbreaks of botulism among mallard populations can lead to mass die-offs.

The predation-avoidance behaviour of sleeping with one eye open, allowing one brain hemisphere to remain aware while the other half sleeps, was first demonstrated in mallards, although it is believed to be widespread among birds in general.

== Status and conservation ==
Since 1998, the mallard has been rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it has a large range–more than 20,000,000 km2 (7,700,000 mi2) and because its population is increasing, rather than declining by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not warranted a vulnerable rating. Also, the population size of the mallard is very large.

Unlike many waterfowl, mallards have benefited from human alterations to the worldso much so that they are now considered an invasive species in some regions. They are a common sight in urban parks, lakes, ponds, and other human-made water features in the regions they inhabit, and are often tolerated or encouraged in human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours. While most are not domesticated, mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk they pose comes from the loss of genetic diversity among a region&#x27;s traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area. Mallards are very adaptable, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous waterfowl. These non-migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domestic and feral populations.
Over time, a continuum of hybrids ranging between almost typical examples of either species develop; the speciation process is beginning to reverse itself. This has created conservation concerns for relatives of the mallard, such as the Hawaiian duck, the New Zealand grey duck (&quot;A.s. superciliosa)&quot; subspecies of the Pacific black duck, the American black duck, the mottled duck, Meller&#x27;s duck, the yellow-billed duck, and the Mexican duck, in the latter case even leading to a dispute as to whether these birds should be considered a species (and thus entitled to more conservation research and funding) or included in the mallard species. Ecological changes and hunting have also led to a decline of local species; for example, the New Zealand grey duck population declined drastically due to overhunting in the mid-20th century. Hybrid offspring of Hawaiian ducks seem to be less well adapted to native habitat, and using them in re-introduction projects apparently reduces success. In summary, the problems of mallards &quot;hybridising away&quot; relatives is more a consequence of local ducks declining than of mallards spreading; allopatric speciation and isolating behaviour have produced today&#x27;s diversity of mallard-like ducks despite the fact that, in most, if not all, of these populations, hybridisation must have occurred to some extent.

=== Invasiveness ===
 Mallards are causing severe &quot;genetic pollution&quot; to South Africa&#x27;s biodiversity by breeding with endemic ducks even though the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds – &quot;an agreement to protect the local waterfowl populations – applies to the mallard as well as other ducks. The hybrids of mallards and the yellow-billed duck are fertile, capable of producing hybrid offspring. If this continues, only hybrids occur and in the long term result in the extinction of various indigenous waterfowl. The mallard can crossbreed with 63 other species, posing a severe threat to indigenous waterfowl&#x27;s genetic integrity. Mallards and their hybrids compete with indigenous birds for resources, including nest sites, roosting sites, and food.
Availability of mallards, mallard ducklings, and fertilised mallard eggs for public sale and private ownership, either as poultry or as pets, is currently legal in the United States, except for the state of Florida, which has currently banned domestic ownership of mallards. This is to prevent hybridisation with the native mottled duck.

The mallard is considered an invasive species in Australia and New Zealand, where it competes with the Pacific black duck (known as the grey duck locally in New Zealand) which was over-hunted in the past. There, and elsewhere, mallards are spreading with increasing urbanisation and hybridising with local relatives.

The eastern or Chinese spot-billed duck is currently introgressing into the mallard populations of the Primorsky Krai, possibly due to habitat changes from global warming. The Mariana mallard was a resident allopatric population – in most respects a good species – apparently initially derived from mallard-Pacific black duck hybrids; it became extinct in the late 20th century.

The Laysan duck is an insular relative of the mallard, with a very small and fluctuating population. Mallards sometimes arrive on its island home during migration, and can be expected to occasionally have remained and hybridised with Laysan ducks as long as these species have existed. However, these hybrids are less well adapted to the peculiar ecological conditions of Laysan Island than the local ducks, and thus have lower fitness. Laysan ducks were found throughout the Hawaiian archipelago before 400AD, after which they suffered a rapid decline during the Polynesian colonisation. Now, their range includes only Laysan Island. It is one of the successfully translocated birds, after having become nearly extinct in the early 20th century.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Domestication ===

Mallards have often been ubiquitous in their regions among the ponds, rivers, and streams of human parks, farms, and other human-made waterwayseven to the point of visiting water features in human courtyards.

Mallards have had a long relationship with humans. Almost all domestic duck breeds derive from the mallard, with the exception of a few Muscovy breeds, and are listed under the trinomial name &quot;A. p. domesticus&quot;. Mallards are generally monogamous while domestic ducks are mostly polygamous. Domestic ducks have no territorial behaviour and are less aggressive than mallards. Domestic ducks are mostly kept for meat; their eggs are also eaten, and have a strong flavour. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4,000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia. As the domestic duck and the mallard are the same species as each other, it is common for mallards to mate with domestic ducks and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile. Because of this, mallards have been found to be contaminated with the genes of the domestic duck.

While the keeping of domestic breeds is more popular, pure-bred mallards are sometimes kept for eggs and meat, although they may require wing clipping to restrict flying.

=== Hunting ===
Mallards are one of the most common species shot in waterfowl hunting due to their large population size. The ideal location for hunting mallards is considered to be where the water level is somewhat shallow where the birds can be found foraging for food. Hunting mallards might cause the population to decline in some places, at some times, and with some populations. In certain countries, the mallard may be legally shot but is protected under national acts and policies. For example, in the United Kingdom, the mallard is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which restricts certain hunting methods or taking or killing mallards.

=== Mallard-Vehicle Collisions ===

Since standardized data collection began in 1990, the United States Federal Aviation Administration has recorded 1320 mallard collisions with aircraft, 261 of which caused damage to the craft (through 2022). In the United States, the mallard ranks as the 7th most hazardous bird to both military and commercial aircraft. Mallards are of particular concern due to their ubiquity; they are widespread and adaptable to urban environments. Mallards also generally fail to avoid approaching vehicles in experimental settings, especially at high vehicle speeds.

Though most bird strikes occur during the takeoff and landing phases of flight, at least one mallard has been struck at cruising altitude (21,000 feet).

=== As food ===
Since ancient times, the mallard has been eaten as food. The wild mallard was eaten in Neolithic Greece. Usually, only the breast and thigh meat is eaten. It does not need to be hung before preparation, and is often braised or roasted, sometimes flavoured with bitter orange or with port.

=== In culture ===

Make Way for Ducklings is a children&#x27;s picture book written and illustrated by Robert McCloskey. The book centers on a pair of mallards who raise their ducklings in the Boston Public Garden.

Migration is an animated adventure comedy film produced by Universal Pictures and Illumination. The story follows a family of mallards who try to migrate from New England to Jamaica.

The world&#x27;s loneliest duck, named &quot;Trevor&quot; by locals after New Zealand politician Trevor Mallard, appeared without explanation on the Pacific island of Niue, dying there in 2019.

<text>Qadiani (, ; ) is a religious slur used to refer to Ahmadi Muslims, primarily in Pakistan. The term originates from Qadian, a small town in northern India, the birthplace of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement. While it is pejorative to the Ahmadi Muslim Community, it is used in official Pakistani documents.

Pakistan officially persecutes Ahmadiyya and uses the term Qadiani to label members of the religion. Pakistan&#x27;s Second Amendment to the Constitution officially declares Ahmadiyya to be non-Muslims. Ordinance XX officially labels Ahmadi Muslims as Qadiani and prohibits them from any religious or social practices of the Muslim faith. The fourth caliph of the community, Mirza Tahir Ahmad, was forced to flee Pakistan under threat of arrest in 1984, prompting a diaspora of followers to the UK, Germany, and Canada. Ahmadiyya members are targets of death threats by majority Muslims, both inside Pakistan and in diaspora refuges.

The term is sometimes used in an academic context to distinguish the main Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat, referred to as Qadiani, from the separatist Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, referred to as Lahori Ahmadis.

<text>Theodore Ernest Els (; born 17 October 1969) is a South African professional golfer. A former , he is nicknamed &quot;The Big Easy&quot; due to his physical stature along with his fluid golf swing. Among his more than 70 career victories are four major championships: the U.S. Open in 1994 at Oakmont and in 1997 at Congressional, and The Open Championship in 2002 at Muirfield and in 2012 at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes. He is one of six golfers to twice win both the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.

Other highlights in Els&#x27;s career include topping the 2003 and 2004 European Tour Order of Merit (money list), and winning the World Match Play Championship a record seven times. He was the leading career money winner on the European Tour until overtaken by Lee Westwood in 2011, and was the first member of the tour to earn over €25,000,000 from European Tour events. He has held the number one spot in the Official World Golf Ranking and until 2013 held the record for weeks ranked in the top ten with 788. Els rose to fifteenth in the world rankings after winning the 2012 Open Championship. He was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2010, on his first time on the ballot, and was inducted in May 2011.

Els now primarily plays on the PGA Tour Champions.

== Background and family ==
Growing up in Lambton, Germiston, South Africa, Els played rugby, cricket, tennis and, starting at age 8, golf. He was a skilled junior tennis player and won the Eastern Transvaal Junior Championships at age 13. Els first learned the game of golf from his father Neels, a trucking executive, at the Germiston Golf course, He was soon playing better than his father (and his older brother, Dirk), and by the age of 14 he was a scratch handicap. It was around this time that he decided to focus exclusively on golf. Els first achieved prominence in 1984, when he won the Junior World Golf Championship in the Boys 13–14 category. Phil Mickelson was second to Els that year. Els won the South African Amateur a few months after his 17th birthday, becoming the youngest-ever winner of that event, breaking the record which had been held since 1935 by Bobby Locke. Els contested the 1987 British Amateur Championship, qualifying from stroke play for the 64-player match play segment, but was knocked out there.

== Professional career ==
=== 1989–1996: early years and first major win ===
In 1989, Els won the South African Amateur Stroke Play Championship and turned professional the same year. Els won his first professional tournament in 1991 on the Southern Africa Tour (today the Sunshine Tour). He won the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit in the 1991/92 and 1994/95 seasons. In 1993, Els won his first tournament outside of South Africa at the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan. In 1994 Els won his first major championship at the U.S. Open. Els was tied with Colin Montgomerie and Loren Roberts after 72 holes and they went to an 18-hole playoff the next day. In spite of starting the playoff bogey-triple bogey, Els was able to match Roberts&#x27; score of 74. Els birdied the second hole of sudden death to win his first U.S. Open title.

Els brought his game all around the world in his young career winning the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour, and the Toyota World Match Play Championship defeating once again Colin Montgomerie 4 &amp; 2. The following year, Els defended his World Match Play Championship, defeating Steve Elkington 3 &amp; 1. Els won the GTE Byron Nelson Classic in the United States then headed back home to South Africa and won twice more. In 1996, Els won his third straight World Match Play Championship at Wentworth, defeating Vijay Singh in the final 3 &amp; 2. No player in history had ever managed to win three successive titles in the one-on-one tournament. Els finished the year with a win at his home tournament at the South African Open.

=== 1997–2002: career years and multi-major championships ===
1997 was a career year for Els first winning his second U.S. Open (once again over Colin Montgomerie) this time at Congressional Country Club, making him the first foreign player since Alex Smith (1906, 1910) to win the U.S. Open twice. He defended his Buick Classic title and added the Johnnie Walker Classic to his list of victories. Els nearly won the World Match Play Championship for a fourth consecutive year, but lost to Vijay Singh in the final. 1998 and 1999 continued to be successful years for Els with 4 wins on both the PGA and European tours.

2000 started with Els being given a special honour by the board of directors of the European Tour awarding him with honorary life membership of the European Tour because of his two U.S. Opens and three World Match Play titles. 2000 was the year of runners-up for Els; with three runner-up finishes in the Majors (Masters, U.S. Open and The Open Championship) and seven second-place finishes in tournaments worldwide. In 2001 Els failed to win a US PGA tour event for the first time since 1994 although he ended the year with nine second-place finishes.

2002 was arguably Els&#x27;s best year, which started with a win at the Heineken Classic at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club. Then went to America and outplayed World Number one Tiger Woods to lift the Genuity Championship title. The premier moment of the season was surely his Open Championship triumph in very tough conditions at Muirfield. Els overcame a four-man playoff to take home the famous Claret Jug trophy for the first time, also quieting his critics about his mental toughness. The South African also won his fourth World Match Play title, along with his third Nedbank Challenge in the last four years, dominating a world-class field and winning by 8 shots.

=== 2003–2005: the Big Five ===
2003 gave Els his first European Tour Order of Merit. Although playing fewer events than his competitors Els won four times and had three runners-up. He also performed well in the United States with back to back victories at the Mercedes Championship – where he set the all-time PGA Tour 72-hole record for most strokes under par at 31 under – and Sony Open and achieved top-20 spots in all four majors, including a fifth-place finish at the U.S. Open and sixth-place finishes at both the Masters and PGA Championship. To top off the season Els won the World Match Play title for a record-tying fifth time. In 2003 he was voted 37th on the SABC3&#x27;s Great South Africans.
2004 was another successful year as Els won 6 times on both tours, including big wins at Memorial, WGC-American Express Championship and his sixth World Match Play Championship, a new record. His success did not stop there. Els showed remarkable consistency in the Majors but lost to Phil Mickelson in the Masters when Mickelson birdied the 18th for the title, finished ninth in the U.S. Open after playing in the final group with friend and fellow countryman Retief Goosen and surprisingly lost in a playoff in the Open to the then-unknown Todd Hamilton. Els had a putt for birdie on the final hole of regulation for the Open at Royal Troon, but he missed the putt and lost in the playoff. Els ended the major season with a fourth-place finish in the PGA Championship, where a three-putt on the 72nd hole would cost him a place in the playoff. In total, Els had 16 top-10 finishes, a second European Order of Merit title in succession and a second-place finish on the United States money list.

2004 was the start of the &quot;Big Five era&quot;, the era in golf in which Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els, Retief Goosen and Phil Mickelson dominated the game. The five switched up and down the top five positions in the World Golf Ranking; most notably Vijay Singh&#x27;s derailment of Tiger Woods as the best golfer in the world. The five stayed, for the most part, in the top five spots from 2004 until the start of 2007. Nine majors were won between them, many fighting against each other head to head.

In July 2005, Els injured his left knee while sailing with his family in the Mediterranean. Despite missing several months of the 2005 season due to the injury, Els won the second event on his return, the Dunhill Championship. With his victory at the 2005 Qatar Masters, an event co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour, Els became the second golfer after Lee Westwood to win on all six of the big tours on the International Federation of PGA Tours.

=== 2006–2011: gradual recovery and comeback ===
At the start of the 2007 season, Ernie Els laid out a three-year battle plan to challenge Tiger Woods as world number one. &quot;I see 2007 as the start of a three-year plan where I totally re-dedicate myself to the game&quot;, Els told his official website. When he missed the cut by two strokes at the 2007 Masters Tournament, Els ended tour-leading consecutive cut streaks on both the PGA Tour and the European Tour. On the PGA Tour, his streak began at the 2004 The Players Championship (46 events) and on the European Tour it began at the 2000 Johnnie Walker Classic (82 events)

Els has often been compared to Greg Norman in the sense that both men&#x27;s careers could be looked back on and think what could have been. Although the two of them are multiple major championship winners, both share disappointment in majors. Their disappointments have ranged from nerves, bad luck, and being outplayed. 1996 was the year where Norman collapsed in the Masters, whereas the year before Els did in the PGA Championship. Nearly four years later, Els finished runner-up in the 2000 Masters Tournament, and again in 2004, losing to Phil Mickelson. Els has finished runner-up in six majors, finishing runner-up to Tiger Woods more than any other golfer, and has often been described as having the right game to finally be the golfer to beat Woods in a major.

On 2 March 2008, Els won the Honda Classic contested at PGA National&#x27;s Championship Course in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Els shot a final round 67 in tough windy conditions, which was enough to give him the win by one stroke over Luke Donald. The win marked the end of a three and a half-year-long stretch without a win on the PGA Tour for Els. The win was also his 16th victory on the PGA Tour.

On 8 April 2008, Els officially announced that he was switching swing coaches from David Leadbetter (whom Els had worked with since 1990) to noted swing coach Butch Harmon. During Els&#x27;s 2008 Masters press conference Els, said the change is in an effort to tighten his swing, shorten his swing, and get a fresh perspective.

Els finally did break his winless streak by capturing the WGC-CA Championship at Doral in 2010, winning by four strokes over fellow countryman Charl Schwartzel. It was Els&#x27;s second WGC tournament title. The victory also saw Els overtake Colin Montgomerie to become the career money leader on the European Tour. Els then won the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill two weeks later. It was his 18th PGA Tour victory, and his second in as many starts. The win at Bay Hill also vaulted Els to the top of the FedEx Cup standings. He held the top spot for 22 consecutive weeks.

In June, Els almost captured his third U.S. Open title at Pebble Beach. Els briefly held a share of the lead after birding the sixth hole, but was derailed by a stretch of bogey, double bogey, bogey on 9,10, and 11. Els finished the tournament in solo 3rd.

Els capped his year by winning the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in October, with a one stroke victory over David Toms, and also capturing the South African Open title by beating Retief Goosen by one shot.

After his successful 2010 season, Els struggled to find his form in 2011. He ultimately dropped out of the top 50 in the Official World Golf Ranking for the first time since 1993.

=== 2012–present: fourth major championship and career volatility ===
Els started the 2012 season in his home country at the Volvo Golf Champions where he finished in a tie for second place after he and Retief Goosen lost out in a playoff to Branden Grace. Els was next in contention at the Transitions Championship, where he needed a win to qualify for the 2012 Masters. Els led the tournament for most of the final round and had the lead outright until the 16th hole. However, he finished the tournament bogey-bogey missing a short three-footer on the last hole to make a playoff. The tournament was eventually won by Luke Donald. In April, Els failed to qualify for the Masters for the first time since 1993. He was ranked 58th in the world prior to the tournament (the top 50 are given automatic invitations). Ultimately, Els&#x27;s unsuccessful bids to qualify for the Masters was viewed as the likely end of his competitiveness on the PGA Tour.

Els surprised the golfing world by winning the 2012 Open Championship in July by birding the 72nd hole. Adam Scott led by four shots after a birdie at the 14th hole, but bogeyed the final four holes to miss a playoff with Els by one stroke. Els&#x27;s win rejuvenated his career and earned him 5-year exemptions to the other 3 majors. Els became the eighth player to win major tournaments in three different decades, joining his countryman Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Raymond Floyd, John Henry Taylor, and Harry Vardon (Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have since become the ninth and tenth, respectively). Els&#x27;s win also marked the third major champion out of the previous four major championships to be won with a type of long putter. His win reignited the controversy over the legality of long or anchored putters in golf.

In June 2013, Els won for the first time since the 2012 Open Championship at the BMW International Open in Munich, Germany. He claimed a wire-to-wire victory with a one-stroke win over Thomas Bjørn for his 28th European Tour title. Els moved up to 14th from 20th in the world rankings after the win.

Els struggled to find his form throughout the 2014 season. He finished 4th at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in February, 5th at The Barclays and 7th at the PGA Championship, but struggled with missed cuts, including a missed cut at the Masters in April. Els&#x27;s struggles continued into 2015 when he made only 10 cuts on the PGA Tour. He finished a 173rd in the FedEx Cup and failed to qualify for the playoffs. In preparation for the anchored putter ban in 2016, Els switched back to the short putter in late 2015. Els&#x27;s struggles with short putts, or the &quot;yips&quot;, became the draw of much media attention in early 2016. At the 2016 Masters Tournament, Els&#x27;s putting was again the source of negative publicity when he six-putted from 3 feet on his opening hole. Els recorded a 9 on the hole and ended up shooting 80–73 and missing the cut. After the Masters, Els thanked his fans on his website for their support and was admittedly embarrassed by his putting performance.

=== 2020: PGA Tour Champions debut ===
In January 2020, Els joined the PGA Tour Champions shortly after his 50th birthday. In January 2020, Els shot 72-65-65 to tie for the lead of his first PGA Tour Champions event, the Mitsubishi Electric Championship at Hualalai. Miguel Ángel Jiménez and Fred Couples also qualified for the playoff. Jiménez won the event with a birdie on the second playoff hole.

In March 2020, Els won the Hoag Classic in Newport Beach, California. Els finished with a 4-under-par 67 to finish 54 holes in 16-under-par 197, two strokes ahead of Fred Couples, Robert Karlsson, and Glen Day. This was just Els&#x27;s third start on the PGA Tour Champions.

In October 2020, Els won the SAS Championship in Cary, North Carolina. Els shot a 6-under-par 66 in the final round to win by one stroke over Colin Montgomerie.

=== 2023 ===
In March 2023, Ernie carded a final round 65 to win the Hoag Classic at Newport Beach, California, by a single stroke.

== Private life ==

Els married his wife Liezl in 1998 in Cape Town, and they have two children, Samantha and Ben. In 2008, after Els started to display an &quot;Autism Speaks&quot; logo on his golf bag it was announced that their then five-year-old son was autistic. Their main residence is at the Wentworth Estate near Wentworth Golf Club in the south of England. However, they also split time between South Africa and their family home in Jupiter, Florida, in order to get better treatment for Ben&#x27;s autism.

Samantha made her debut for the Springbok Women, South Africa women&#x27;s national rugby union team, against the San Clemente Rhinos, 19 September 2023. When not playing, Els has a golf course design business, a charitable foundation that supports golf among underprivileged youth in South Africa, and a winemaking business.

=== Els-designed golf courses ===
*Anahita Golf Course – Beau Champ, Mauritius
*Mission Hills Golf Club (The Savannah Course) – Shenzhen, China

*The Els Club – Dubai, UAE
*The Els Club Teluk Datai - Langkawi, Malaysia
*The Els Club Desaru Coast - Desaru, Malaysia

Els was also responsible for the refinement and modernisation of the West Course, Wentworth-Virginia Water, England, which took place in 2006.

Courses under construction include:

*Hoakalei Country Club at Hoakalei Resort – Ewa Beach, Hawaii
*Albany – New Providence, The Bahamas
*Ecopark - Hanoi, Vietnam
*Durrat Al Bahrain Golf Course – Durrat Al Bahrain, Bahrain

===Internationalization of golf===
Unlike most of his contemporaries, Els is known for his willingness to participate in tournaments all around the world, having played regularly in European Tour-sanctioned events in Asia, Australasia and his native country of South Africa. He says that his globe-trotting schedule is in recognition of the global nature of golf. This has caused some friction with the PGA Tour, an organisation that would prefer Els to play more tournaments in the United States. In late 2004, Tim Finchem, the director of the PGA Tour, wrote quite a firm letter to Els asking him to do so but Els publicized and rejected this request. The PGA Tour&#x27;s attitude caused considerable offense in the golfing world outside of North America.

=== Foundation ===
The Ernie Els and Fancourt Foundation was established in 1999. It has the objective of identifying youths from under-privileged backgrounds who show talent and potential in the game of golf. It provides educational assistance amongst other moral and financial help in order for these youths to reach their full potential.

The first Friendship Cup was played in 2006 which is a match play competition, played in a Ryder Cup type format. In the cup, Els&#x27;s foundation plays against the foundation of Tiger Woods. Els&#x27;s foundation won 12.5 points to 3.5 points.

Els has also participated several times in the Gary Player Invitational series of charity golf events, to assist Player in raising significant funds for underprivileged children around the world.

=== Autism-related activities ===
Since his son&#x27;s autism diagnosis, Els and his wife have been active in charities devoted to that condition. This involvement has increased as Ben has reached school age. In 2009, Els launched an annual charity golf event, the Els for Autism Pro-Am, held at the PGA National Resort &amp; Spa in Palm Beach Gardens near his South Florida residence during the PGA Tour&#x27;s March swing into the area. The first event, which featured many PGA Tour and Champions Tour golfers, raised $725,000 for The Renaissance Learning Center, a nonprofit charter school in the area for autistic children. The couple has also established the Els Center of Excellence, which began as a drive to build a new campus for the aforementioned school in Jupiter, Florida, but has since expanded into a $30 million plan to combine the school with a research facility.

=== ASM Scholarships ===
Ernie Els co-founded an athletic scholarship agency called (ASM Scholarships), in October 2018. The company is a college recruiting service that works with athletes worldwide from various sports and helps them secure athletic scholarships to American universities within the NCAA, NAIA and NJCAA. The company is owned by the ASM Sports Group, which has built a pathway for athletes from high school to college then professional sports or a career in a sporting job. In 2020 the company helped over 1000 athletes secure sport scholarships on average of $35,000 per year for student athletes, a total of $35,000,000. The company HQ is based in West Palm Beach Florida.

<doc id="230468" wikidata="Q5056668" url="?curid=230468" title="Lodging">
<text>Lodging refers to the use of a short-term dwelling, usually by renting the living space or sometimes through some other arrangement. People who travel and stay away from home for more than a day need lodging for sleep, rest, food, safety, shelter from cold temperatures or rain, storage of luggage and access to common household functions. Lodging is a form of the sharing economy.

Lodging is done in a hotel, motel, hostel, or inn, a private home (commercial, i.e. a bed and breakfast, a guest house, a vacation rental, or non-commercially, as in certain homestays or the home of friends), in a tent, caravan/campervan (often on a campsite). Lodgings may be self-catering, whereby no food is provided, but cooking facilities are available.

Lodging is offered by an owner of real property or a leasehold estate, including the hotel industry, hospitality industry, real estate investment trusts, and owner-occupancy houses.

Lodging can be facilitated by an intermediary such as a travel website.

==Regulations by jurisdiction==
Regulation of short-term rentals can include requirements for hosts to have business licenses, payment of hotel taxes and compliance with building, city and zoning standards. The hotel industry has lobbied for stricter regulations on short-term home rental and in addition to government-imposed restrictions, many homeowner associations also limit short term rentals.

===Europe===
* Amsterdam: Hosts can rent their properties for up to 30 nights per year to a group of no more than four at a time. Short-term rentals are banned in certain parts of the city.
* Barcelona: Vacation apartments are subject to the highest rate of property tax; platforms must share data with regulators.
* Berlin: Short-term rentals require permission from authorities. Hosts can rent individual rooms with the condition that they live in most of the property.
* Ireland: Short-term rentals are restricted to a maximum of 90 days per year for primary residences; registration is required with local authorities and planning permission is required where a property changes use from private residence to full-time short-term rental. However, compliance with these requirements is minimal, with one study finding only 38 listed properties had the required planning permission, out of 25,000.
* London: Short-term rentals are limited to 90 days per year.
* Lucerne: Short-term apartment rentals are limited to 90 days per year. 
* Madrid: Listings without private entrances are banned.
* Palma de Mallorca: Home-sharing sites are banned to contain tourism.
* Paris: Hosts can rent their homes for no more than 120 days a year and must register their listing with the town hall.
* Rome: Short-term rental sites are required to withhold a 21% rental income tax.
* Venice: Hosts must collect and remit tourist taxes.
* Vienna: Short-term rentals are banned in specific &quot;residential zones&quot; within the city, with the exemption of apartments used primarily for the host&#x27;s own residential needs.

===United States===
* Phoenix, Arizona: Most regulations are not allowed since municipalities are prohibited from interfering in property rights.
* Boston, Massachusetts: The types of properties eligible for use as short-term rentals and the number of days per year a property may be rented are limited.
* Chicago, Illinois: Hosts are required to obtain a license. Single-night stays are prohibited.
* Jersey City, New Jersey: Hosts are only allowed to rent for 60 days per year.
* Los Angeles, California: Hosts must register with the city planning department and pay an $89 fee and cannot home-share for more than 120 days in a calendar year.
* Miami, Florida: Short-term rentals are banned in most neighborhoods, in part due to lobbying efforts of the hotel industry.
* New York City, New York: Rentals under 30 days are prohibited unless the host is present on the property. Hosts are required to obtain a license and relatively few licenses have been issued.
* Portland, Oregon: The number of bedrooms in a single unit that may be listed is limited.
* San Diego, California: Units for short-term rental are limited to 1% of the housing stock and licenses are required.
* San Francisco, California: Registration by hosts is required.
* Santa Monica, California: Hosts are required to register with the city and obtain a license and are also prohibited from listing multiple properties.
* Seattle, Washington: Hosts must obtain licenses and cannot rent more than two units.
* Washington, D.C.: Hosts must obtain a short-term rental license, and, if the host is not present, those rentals are limited to a combined 90 days each year.
* West New York, New Jersey: Short-term rentals are banned.

===Canada===
* Toronto: Short-term rentals must be in a host&#x27;s primary residence and hosts must obtain licenses.
* Vancouver: Short-term rentals must be in a host&#x27;s primary residence and hosts must obtain licenses.

===Asia===
* Japan: Hosts are required to register their listing with the government; a home can be rented for a maximum of 180 days per year.
* Singapore: Short-term home rentals of less than three months are illegal.

<doc id="230470" wikidata="Q766483" url="?curid=230470" title="Opcode">
<text>In computing, an opcode (abbreviated from operation code) is an enumerated value that specifies the operation to be performed. Opcodes are employed in hardware devices such as arithmetic logic units (ALUs), central processing units (CPUs), and software instruction sets. In ALUs, the opcode is directly applied to circuitry via an input signal bus. In contrast, in CPUs, the opcode is the portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed.

==CPUs==
Opcodes are found in the machine language instructions of CPUs as well as in some abstract computing machines. In CPUs, an opcode may be referred to as an instruction machine code, instruction code, instruction syllable, instruction parcel, or opstring. For any particular processor (which may be a general CPU or a more specialized processing unit), the opcodes are defined by the processor&#x27;s instruction set architecture (ISA). They can be described using an opcode table. The types of operations may include arithmetic, data copying, logical operations, program control, and special instructions (e.g., CPUID).

In addition to the opcode, many instructions specify the data (known as operands) the operation will act upon, although some instructions may have implicit operands or none. Some instruction sets have nearly uniform fields for opcode and operand specifiers, whereas others (e.g., x86 architecture) have a less uniform, variable-length structure. Instruction sets can be extended through opcode prefixes, which add a subset of new instructions made up of existing opcodes following reserved byte sequences.

==Software instruction sets==
Opcodes can be found in so-called byte codes and other representations intended for a software interpreter rather than a hardware device. These software-based instruction sets often employ slightly higher-level data types and operations than most hardware counterparts but are nevertheless constructed along similar lines. Examples include the byte code found in Java class files, which are then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the byte code used in GNU Emacs for compiled Lisp code, NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL), and many others.

<text>A premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common event where the heartbeat is initiated by Purkinje fibers in the ventricles rather than by the sinoatrial node. PVCs may cause no symptoms or may be perceived as a &quot;skipped beat&quot; or felt as palpitations in the chest. PVCs do not usually pose any danger.
The electrical events of the heart detected by the electrocardiogram (ECG) allow a PVC to be easily distinguished from a normal heart beat. However, very frequent PVCs can be symptomatic of an underlying heart condition (such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy). Furthermore, very frequent (over 20% of all heartbeats) PVCs are considered a risk factor for arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, in which the heart muscle becomes less effective and symptoms of heart failure may develop. Ultrasound of the heart is therefore recommended in people with frequent PVCs.
If PVCs are frequent or troublesome, medication (beta blockers or certain calcium channel blockers) may be used. Very frequent PVCs in people with dilated cardiomyopathy may be treated with radiofrequency ablation.

==Signs and symptoms==
Although there are many possible symptoms associated with PVCs, PVCs may also have no symptoms at all. PVCs may be perceived as a skipped heart beat, a strong beat, palpitations, or lightheadedness. They may also cause chest pain, a faint feeling, fatigue, or hyperventilation after exercise. Symptoms may be more pronounced at times of stress. Women may be more aware of PVCs at the time of the menstrual period.

Premature ventricular contractions may be associated with underlying heart disease, and certain characteristics are therefore elicited routinely: the presence of signs of heart disease or a known history of heart disease (e.g. previous myocardial infarction), as well as heart disease or sudden cardiac death in close relatives. PVCs and palpitation associated with syncope (transient loss of consciousness) or provoked by exertion are also concerning. Physical examination is focused on identifying evidence of underlying heart disease.

==Causes==

Premature ventricular contractions occur in healthy persons of any age, but are more prevalent in the elderly and in men. In a very significant proportion of people they occur spontaneously with no known cause. 

Some possible underlying causes of PVCs include:

=== Non-cardiac causes ===
* Adrenaline excess
* Anemia
* Catecholamine excess
* Certain medicines such as tricyclic antidepressants, digoxin, sympathomimetics, aminophylline
* Chemical (electrolyte) abnormalities in the blood (for example hypokalemia (low blood potassium), which can occur in those taking diuretics (&quot;water pills&quot;) and hypomagnesaemia (magnesium deficiency)).
* Contact with the carina (trachea/bronchi) when performing medical suctioning stimulates vagus nerve
* Drugs/substances such as:
** Amphetamines
** Alcohol
** Caffeine
** Cocaine
** Nicotine
** Theobromine
* Hypercapnia (CO2 poisoning)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hyperthyroidism
* High blood calcium
* Hypoxia and/or hypercapnia
* Lack of sleep/exhaustion
* Sarcoidosis
* Smoking
* Stress
* Anxiety

=== Cardiac causes ===
* Any structural heart disease which alters electrical conduction pathways due to tissue alterations
* Cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic or dilated
* Myocardial infarction
* Myocarditis
* Myocardial contusion
* Mitral valve prolapse

==Pathophysiology==
Normally, impulses pass through both ventricles almost at the same time and the depolarization waves of the two ventricles partially cancel each other out in the ECG. However, when a PVC occurs the impulse nearly always travels through only one bundle fiber, so there is no neutralization effect; this results in the high voltage QRS wave in the electrocardiograph.

There are three main physiological explanations for premature ventricular contractions: enhanced ectopic nodal automaticity, re-entry signaling, and toxic/reperfusion triggered.

Ectopic enhanced nodal automaticity suggests foci of sub-pulmonic valvular pacemaker cells that have a subthreshold potential for firing. The basic rhythm of the heart raises these cells to threshold, which precipitates an ectopic beat. This process is the underlying mechanism for arrhythmias due to excess catecholamines and some electrolyte deficiencies, particularly low blood potassium, known as hypokalemia.

Reentry occurs when an area of 1-way block in the Purkinje fibers and a second area of slow conduction are present. This condition is frequently seen in patients with underlying heart disease that creates areas of differential conduction and recovery due to myocardial scarring or ischemia. During ventricular activation, one bundle tract&#x27;s area of slow conduction activates the other tract&#x27;s bundle fibers post block after the rest of the ventricle has recovered. This resulting in an extra beat. Reentry can produce single ectopic beats, or it can trigger paroxysmal tachycardia.

Triggered beats are considered to be due to after-depolarizations triggered by the preceding action potential. These are often seen in patients with ventricular arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity and reperfusion therapy after myocardial infarction (MI).

This ectopy of the ventricles when associated with a structurally normal heart most commonly occurs from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) under the pulmonic valve. The mechanism behind this is thought to be enhanced automaticity versus triggered activity.

===Molecular basis===
There are a number of different molecular explanations for PVCs.
* calcium excess: One explanation is most basically due to an increased amount of cyclic AMP(cAMP) in the muscle cells of the heart&#x27;s ventricles leading to increased flow of calcium ions into the cell. This may happen for the following reasons:

:*Activation of the sympathetic nervous system, due to anxiety and/or physiological stress, for example hypovolemia caused by dehydration or bleeding. This activation can cause a release of catecholamines such as epinephrine (adrenaline) which can bind to beta-1 adrenergic receptor (β1 receptors) on cardiac myocytes, activating a type of guanosine nucleotide-binding protein called Gs protein. This type of protein stimulates the production of cAMP, ultimately increasing the flow of calcium ions from the extracellular space and from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. This has the effect of (1) increasing the strength of contraction (inotropy) and (2) depolarizing the myocyte more rapidly (chronotropy). The ventricular myocytes are therefore more irritable than usual, and may depolarize spontaneously before the SA node depolarizes. Other sympathomimetic molecules such as amphetamines and cocaine will also cause this effect.
:*Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as caffeine directly affect the G-coupled signal transduction cascade by inhibiting the enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of cAMP, again leading to the increased concentration of calcium ions in the cytosol.
* potassium deficiency: Potassium ion concentrations are a major determinant in the magnitude of the electrochemical potential of cells, and hypokalemia makes it more likely that cells will depolarize spontaneously. Hypercalcemia has a similar effect, although clinically it is of less concern.
* magnesium deficiency: Magnesium ions affect the flow of calcium ions, and they affect the function of the Na+/K+ ATPase, and are necessary for maintaining potassium levels. Low blood magnesium therefore also makes spontaneous depolarization more likely.
* myocardium damage: Existing damage to the myocardium can also provoke PVCs. The myocardial scarring that occurs in myocardial infarction and also in the surgical repair of congenital heart disease can disrupt the conduction system of the heart and may also irritate surrounding viable ventricular myocytes, make them more likely to depolarize spontaneously. Inflammation of the myocardium (as occurs in myocarditis) and systemic inflammation cause surges of cytokines, which can affect the electrical properties of myocytes and may be ultimately responsible for causing irritability of myocytes.

== Diagnosis ==

PVCs may be found incidentally on cardiac tests such as a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) performed for another reason. In those with symptoms suggestive of premature ventricular complexes, the ECG/EKG is the first investigation that may identify PVCs as well as other cardiac rhythm issues that may cause similar symptoms. If symptoms are infrequent, other forms of continuous heart beat recording may be used, such as a 24 or 48-hour Holter monitor or even 14- to 30-day recorders if the symptoms are very occasional. The advantage of these monitors is that they allow a quantification of the amount of abnormal beats (&quot;burden&quot;) and ensure that there are no heart arrhythmias present that might require attention, such as ventricular tachycardia. If symptoms are associated with exercise, a supervised cardiac stress test may be required to reproduce the abnormality. Specifically, if this shows exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia this would require specific treatment. If PVCs are suppressed by exercise, this is an encouraging finding.

On electrocardiography (ECG or Holter) premature ventricular contractions have a specific appearance of the QRS complexes and T waves, which are different from normal readings. By definition, a PVC occurs earlier than the regular normally conducted beat. Subsequently, the time between the PVC and the next normal beat is longer as the result of a compensatory pause. PVCs can be distinguished from premature atrial contractions because the compensatory pause is longer following premature ventricular contractions, in addition to a difference in QRS appearance.

In some people, PVCs occur in a predictable pattern. Two PVCs in a row are called doublets and three PVCs in a rows are triplets. Depending whether there are one, two, or three normal (sinus) beats between each PVC, the rhythm is called bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy. If 3 or more consecutive PVCs occur in a row it may be called ventricular tachycardia. The precise shape of the QRS can give an indication as to where precisely in the heart muscle the abnormal electrical activity arises. If someone has PVCs that all have the same appearance, they are considered &quot;monofocal&quot;, if PVC’s have different appearance, they are considered “multifocal”.

==Treatment==
Isolated PVCs with benign characteristics and no underlying heart disease require no treatment, especially if there are limited symptoms.

The most effective treatment is the elimination of triggers (particularly stopping the use of substances such as caffeine and certain drugs, like tobacco). If frequent, it’s possible to use:
* Medications
** Antiarrhythmics: these agents alter the electrophysiologic mechanisms responsible for PVCs. In CAST study of survivors of myocardial infarction encainide and flecainide, it was shown that, though those drugs could suppress PVC, they also increased the risk of death. However, while moricizine increased the death rate when used with diuretics, it reduced the frequency of deaths when it was used alone.
** Beta blockers: do not directly affect or reduce the occurrence of PVCs, but reduce cardiac contractility which makes PVCs less obvious to a person; possibly reduce catecholamine induced PVCs (in catecholamine-sensitive people) due to adrenaline not reaching sinus node as much.
** Calcium channel blockers
* Electrolytes replacement
** Magnesium supplements (e.g. magnesium citrate, orotate, Maalox, etc.)
** Potassium supplements (e.g. chloride potassium with citrate ion)
* Radiofrequency catheter ablation treatment. It is advised for people with ventricular dysfunction and/or tachyarrhythmia or very frequent PVC (&gt;20% in 24 h) and normal ventricular function. This procedure is a way to destroy the area of the heart tissue that is causing the irregular contractions characteristic of PVCs using radio frequency energy.
* Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
* Lifestyle modification
** Frequently stressed individuals should consider therapy, or joining a support group.

==Prognosis==
PVCs are harmless. For patients with more than 1,000 PVCs per day, the risk of developing left ventricular systolic dysfunction after 5 years follow-up is low. Frequent PVCs may increase the risk of developing cardiomyopathy, which can greatly impair heart function. A PVC burden greater than 10% is the minimal threshold for development of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. The risk is higher with a PVC burden greater than 20%. PVC burden often decreases spontaneously over time.

People who do not have heart disease (with ejection fractions greater than 40%) have the same long-term prognoses as the minority of people without PVCs on the 24 hours. Emerging data also suggest that very frequent ventricular ectopy may be associated with cardiomyopathy through a mechanism thought to be similar to that of chronic right ventricular pacing associated cardiomyopathy. For patients with underlying chronic structural heart disease and complex ectopy, mortality is significantly increased.

In meta-analysis of 11 studies, people with frequent PVCs (≥ once during a standard electrocardiographic recording or ≥30 times over a 1-hour recording) had risk of cardiac death twice as great as that of participants with occasional PVCs. Although most researchers attempted to exclude high-risk subjects, such as those with histories of cardiovascular disease, they did not test participants for underlying structural heart disease.

==Epidemiology==
Single PVCs are common in healthy persons. When 24-hour ambulatory monitoring is used, up to 80 percent of apparently healthy people have occasional PVCs. Rates vary by age with extremely rare for those under the age of 11 and extremely common in those older than 75 years. These differences may be due to rates of high blood pressure and atherosclerosis, which are more easy to find in older persons. In 101 people free of heart disease during 24 hours Holter monitoring, 39 had at least 1 PVC, and 4 at least 100. Heart disease was excluded after physical examination, chest x-ray, ECG, echocardiography, maximal exercise stress test, right- and left-heart catheterization and coronary angiography. In 122,043 United States Air Force flyers and cadet applicants during approximately 48 seconds of ECG 0.78% (952 males) had PVC within all age groups, but with increased incidence with increasing age. Ventricular ectopy is more prevalent in men than in women of the same age; data from large, population-based studies indicate that the prevalence is less for young white women without heart disease and greater for older African American individuals with hypertension.

<doc id="230479" wikidata="Q4883566" url="?curid=230479" title="Bellbird (TV series)">
<text>Bellbird is an Australian soap opera serial broadcast by the &quot;ABC&quot; created and co-written by Barbara Vernon, it screened for 10 seasons between 1967 and 1977, and spanned 1,697 episodes. The series centered around the residents of the small fictional Victorian rural township of the series title.

Bellbird has the distinction of being the longest-running soap opera/serial ever produced by the ABC. It ended the same year as commercial broadcast series &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot;, which had run for six and four years respectively.

==Production and broadcasting==
The series was produced by the ABC at the Ripponlea Studios in Melbourne, with the opening titles filmed at nearby Daylesford. Bellbird screened from 28 August 1967 to 23 December 1977 and although it was not Australia&#x27;s first television serial (the first was Network Seven&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Affair&quot;), it was the first successful soap opera and even spawned a feature film and tie-in novel.

The show&#x27;s ratings were modest but it had a devoted following, especially in rural Australia, akin to the ABC&#x27;s long-running radio drama &quot;Blue Hills&quot;. During most of its 10-year production run, 15-minute episodes of &quot;Bellbird&quot; screened from Monday to Thursday nights, leading in to the 7:00 pm evening news bulletin. In 1976, the series was screened as a single one-hour episode each week, before switching to three half-hour instalments per week during its final season.

==Storylines==
The show&#x27;s storylines followed the lives of the residents of the small fictional country town that gave the show its title. While the series plots concentrated mainly on small-scale interpersonal, domestic and local relationships, issues and conflicts, there were occasional moments of high drama. One of the most celebrated was the death of the local stock and station agent, Charlie Cousens, played by foundation cast member Robin Ramsay. When Ramsay decided to leave the series in 1968, his character was written out in dramatic fashion, with Cousens plunging to his death from the top of a wheat silo. The death scene has figured prominently in retrospectives of great moments in Australian television, and its celebrity meant that it became one of the few segments from the early years of the series that has survived.

Other notable deaths during the course of the series included those of local farm girl, Hagar Grossark (Barbara Ramsay), who drowned during a flood, and the 1974 death of major character Rhoda Lang, played by foundation cast member Lynette Curran, who was killed when her car was struck by a train at a level crossing.

==Cast==
&quot;Bellbird&quot; featured a regular cast of 46 actors over its 10-year run. The National Archives of Australia holds a collection of prints from 1977, identifying over 30 actors involved from that time.

===Main===
==Foundation creative team==
The show was based on a short treatment by Colin Free then developed by original story editor Barbara Vernon. The original story team included Vernon, Alan Hopgood and Michael Wright. The first executive producer was Brett Porter. The original directors were James Davern and Oscar Whitbread.

==International screenings==
Episodes of &quot;Bellbird&quot; were screened briefly in the United Kingdom in 1972. After the initial 52 episodes had been screened, Actors Equity in Australia insisted the ABC increase the price of the episodes so as to pay the actors more. As a result of the price increase, the UK broadcaster purchased no further episodes.

==Episodes==
Although an extensive selection of episodes survive and reside with the National Archives of Australia, it was reported that the ABC taped over the master tapes of the series, which was a common practice of the time something which series cast member Alan Hopgood had complained about in a &quot;TV Times&quot; article in 1976: &quot;They just wiped [them] off and another episode [was] run over them ... This failure to preserve the program is criminal, to my way of thinking.&quot;

One complete black and white episode is available to be viewed at the Australian Mediatheque at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, while several colour episodes are known to exist in the hands of private collectors.

==Film and novel ==
The series was the first soap opera in Australia to spin off into a feature film version and tie-in novel, entitled &quot;Country Town&quot; (1971). It focused on Bellbird&#x27;s problems during a severe drought. Many future soaps followed suit, spawning their own film versions, including &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Sullivans&quot;.

==Ratings==
In 1971, &quot;Bellbird&quot; was the fifteenth most popular show in the country.

<text>Sepp Kerschbaumer (9 November 1913 – 7 December 1964) was a terrorist member of the South Tyrolean Liberation Committee &quot;(Befreiungsausschuss Südtirol (BAS))&quot;, which campaigned for the break-away of South Tyrol from Italy. In 1961, the BAS staged the so-called &quot;Feuernacht&quot; (Night of Fire), the destruction of several dozen electricity pylons, which escalated the South Tyrol conflict. The Italian state viewed the BAS as a terrorist and separatist organization, while large parts of the South Tyroleans regarded them as freedom fighters.

== Early life ==
Sepp Kerschbaumer was the son of the merchant Josef Kerschbaumer and his wife Luise of Aldein, and born in the village of Frangart, which today is a &quot;frazione&quot; of Eppan. Kerschbaumer&#x27;s father was killed on the Dolomite Front in World War I when he was four, followed by the death of his mother when he was nine.

After his education in Bolzano and Neustift Monastery, he completed the commercial preparatory school in Brixen in 1927. In 1933 he was conscripted into military service. In late 1934 Kerschbaumer was banished for two years because of participation in a forbidden political meeting. After Benito Mussolini pardoned him in late 1935, he returned to South Tyrol. At this point, he was put in charge of his parents&#x27; grocery business by his guardian.

== Politics ==

Fascist Italy had begun a process of Italianization of South Tyrol, a predominantly German-speaking area gained by Italy after World War I. Under the South Tyrol Option Agreement (1939), Kerschbaumer chose to migrate to Nazi Germany. But he later realized that no assistance could be expected from Germany. After World War II he joined the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party and dedicated himself to local politics. He became local chairman of the party and local council head of Frangart.

At the start of the 1950s, he became frustrated at what he felt was the too conciliatory attitude of the SVP. At a large demonstration on 17 November 1957, Kerschbaumer distributed an anonymous leaflet demanding &quot;a free South Tyrol&quot;. From then on he began to found and build the South Tyrolean Liberation Committee (BAS), which was at first limited to distributing leaflets and symbolic actions, such as the display of the then forbidden flag of South Tyrol. On 12 June 1961, the BAS organized the destruction by explosives of 37 electricity pylons supplying power to the industrial zone of Bolzano, later known as the Night of Fire (&quot;Feuernacht&quot;).

== Incarceration and death ==

In the aftermath of the Feuernacht, Sepp Kerschbaumer was arrested and allegedly tortured by police. The rumored mistreatment of Kerschbaumer may have contributed to further escalation of events. Being the leading member of BAS, Sepp Kerschbaumer was sentenced to fifteen years and eleven months on 16 July 1964, for organizing the bombing. On 7 December 1964 he died in prison in Verona of a heart attack. More than 15,000 inhabitants attended the funeral on 9 December 1964, about 5% of the whole population then.
== Personal life ==
Kerschbaumer was a deeply devout Catholic and participated daily in holy mass in Bolzano; while in prison, he often prayed the rosary.

On 29 April 1936, he married Maria Sancheti from Bolzano. The couple had six children.

<doc id="230481" wikidata="Q200804" url="?curid=230481" title="Predator (film)">
<text>Predator is a 1987 American science fiction action film directed by John McTiernan and written by brothers Jim and John Thomas. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Dutch Schaefer, the leader of an elite paramilitary rescue team on a mission to save hostages in guerrilla-held territory in a Central American rainforest, who encounter the deadly Predator (Kevin Peter Hall), a skilled, technologically-advanced extraterrestrial who stalks and hunts them down. Carl Weathers, Elpidia Carrillo, Bill Duke, Richard Chaves, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham, and Shane Black are supporting co-stars.

&quot;Predator&quot; was written in 1984 with the working title of &quot;Hunter&quot;. Filming ran from March to June 1986 with creature effects devised by Stan Winston and a budget of around $15 million. 20th Century Fox released the film on June 12, 1987, in the United States, and it grossed $98 million worldwide. Initial reviews were mixed, but the film has since been considered a classic of the action and science fiction genres and one of the best films of the 1980s, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

The success of &quot;Predator&quot; launched a media franchise of films, novels, comic books, video games, and toys. It spawned four additional films: &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990), &quot;Predators&quot; (2010), &quot;The Predator&quot; (2018), and &quot;Prey&quot; (2022). A crossover with the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise produced the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; films &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004) and &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; (2007). Schaefer would return in the video games &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (1994) and &quot;&quot; (2020), with Schwarzenegger reprising his role in the latter.

==Plot==

An extraterrestrial spacecraft deploys a shuttle to Earth. Sometime later, Dutch and his elite paramilitary rescue team—skilled mercenary Mac, explosives expert Poncho, the macho Blain, expert tracker Billy, and jokester Hawkins—are tasked with rescuing a local cabinet minister whose helicopter was shot down in a Central American jungle. Dutch&#x27;s old friend and Vietnam War ally Dillon, now a CIA agent, accompanies the team to oversee the mission.

The team find the helicopter wreckage and traces of guerrilla soldiers, as well as three skinned corpses hung high in the trees nearby. Dutch identifies the corpses as Green Berets, and becomes suspicious of Dillon&#x27;s intentions after learning the helicopter was outfitted for surveillance. Dutch&#x27;s team attacks the guerrilla camp, killing the soldiers and their Russian military allies, and learning the hostages were CIA agents. Dillon admits the cabinet minister story was a lie to convince Dutch—who refuses to use his team for assassinations—to eliminate the camp and prevent a Soviet-sponsored invasion. Dillon also discloses that the original mission team disappeared and the Green Berets had been sent to find them. Dillon takes a surviving guerrilla, Anna, prisoner, and the team travels towards the extraction point.

Unbeknownst to the team, a technologically-advanced, humanoid predator has stalked them since their arrival, remaining invisible with a cloaking device, and using thermal imaging vision to see their body heat. Billy senses the presence of something inhuman, but cannot confirm his suspicions. Anna flees while the team are distracted, and although Hawkins catches her, he is killed by the predator while Anna is spared. While the team searches for Hawkins&#x27; body, the predator kills Blain. Mac glimpses the predator&#x27;s cloaked form and, enraged at Blain&#x27;s death, provokes the team into blindly firing their weapons into the jungle, wounding the predator. The team makes camp for the night, booby-trapping the perimeter. A wild boar triggers a trap, and the predator uses the ensuing confusion to steal Blain&#x27;s corpse.

The following day, Dutch deduces that the predator is stalking them from the treetops. Dutch releases Anna, needing her to work with them to survive. She recounts local folktales of a monster who kills men and takes trophies from their corpses, typically when the weather is hottest. The team booby-trap the treetops to force the predator into a net, but it is able to escape and Poncho is injured. Mac and Dillon, who wants to make amends to the team, pursue the predator, but they are outmaneuvered and killed. The predator soon catches the survivors, killing Billy and Poncho. Realizing the predator only attacks those it considers a threat, Dutch warns Anna to relinquish her weapon and run to the extraction point. Dutch distracts the predator before falling from a cliff into a waterfall and washing up on a muddy shore. The predator pursues Dutch, but is seemingly unable to see him, and leaves to collect the skulls of the others as trophies. Dutch concludes that the mud masked his body heat, making him invisible to the predator.

Seeking to avenge his team, Dutch creates makeshift traps and weapons. As night falls, he covers himself in mud and cries out to draw the predator to him. Dutch uses his invisibility to wound the predator and disable its cloaking device, but falls into a river and his mud camouflage is washed off. Deeming Dutch a worthy opponent, the predator removes its weapons and mask—revealing a monstrous visage—to face him in hand-to-hand combat. Easily outmatched by the larger and stronger creature, Dutch attempts to goad it into a trapped tunnel, but the predator suspects his plan and goes around it. Dutch triggers the trap himself, releasing its counterweight, which crushes the predator. Mortally wounded, the predator activates a wrist-mounted self-destruct device. Dutch flees, barely escaping the enormous resulting explosion that razes the area.

As dawn breaks, the extraction helicopter arrives with Anna to collect the exhausted and traumatized Dutch.

==Production==

===Development===
The Jim and John Thomas script for &quot;Predator&quot; was originally titled &quot;Hunter&quot;. The original concept, centered on a plot of &quot;what it is to be hunted&quot;, concerned a band of alien hunters of various species seeking various targets; that concept was eventually streamlined to one extraterrestrial hunting the most dangerous species, humans, and the &quot;most dangerous man&quot;, a combat soldier. Additionally, the setting was chosen as Central America for having constant special forces operations during that period.

As the Thomas brothers were first-time screenwriters with little credibility in Hollywood, they struggled to attract attention for their proposed film and eventually resorted to slipping the script under the door of 20th Century Fox producer Michael Levy (who would go on to serve as executive producer on the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Predator 2&quot;). Levy then brought the screenplay to producer Joel Silver who, based on his experience with &quot;Commando&quot;, decided to turn the science fiction pulp story line into a big-budget film. Silver enlisted his former boss Lawrence Gordon as co-producer and John McTiernan was hired as director for his first studio film. At one point, New Zealand director Geoff Murphy was also considered to direct.

===Casting===

Silver and Gordon first approached Arnold Schwarzenegger with the lead role. Schwarzenegger said: 

He had previously starred in &quot;Commando&quot;, on which Silver had served as producer. To play the elite band of soldiers, both Silver and Gordon, with co-producer John Davis, searched for other larger-than-life men of action. Carl Weathers, who had been memorable as boxer Apollo Creed in the &quot;Rocky&quot; films, was their first choice to play Dillon while professional wrestler and former Navy SEAL Jesse Ventura was hired for his formidable physique as Blain, co-starring with Schwarzenegger the same year in &quot;The Running Man&quot;. Also cast were Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves, and Bill Duke, who costarred alongside Schwarzenegger in &quot;Commando&quot;.

Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally cast as the Predator with the intent that the physical action star would use his martial arts skills to make the Predator an agile, ninja-like hunter. But when the 5&#x27;9&quot; Van Damme was compared to Schwarzenegger, Weathers, and Ventura — actors over 6 feet tall and known for their bodybuilding regimens — it became apparent a more physically imposing man was needed to make the creature appear threatening. Additionally, it was reported that Van Damme constantly complained about the monster suit being too hot and causing him to pass out. He allegedly had also repeatedly voiced reservations about only appearing on camera in the suit. Additionally, the original design for the Predator was felt to be too cumbersome and difficult to manage in the jungle and, even with a more imposing actor, did not provoke enough fear. Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by the 7&#x27;2&quot; Kevin Peter Hall, who had just finished work as a sasquatch in &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;.

===Filming===
Commitments by Schwarzenegger delayed the start of filming by several months. The delay gave Silver enough time to secure a minor rewrite from screenwriter David Peoples. Principal photography eventually began in the jungles of Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico, during the last week of March 1986, but of the film was shot in Mismaloya, Mexico. Much of the material dealing with the unit&#x27;s deployment in the jungle was completed in a few short weeks and both Silver and Gordon were pleased by the dailies provided by McTiernan. On Friday, April 25, production halted so that Schwarzenegger could get to his wedding on time, flying to Hyannis Port in a Learjet chartered by Silver. Schwarzenegger was married on April 26, 1986, to Maria Shriver, and honeymooned for only three days while the second unit completed additional filming. The production resumed filming on May 12 and ended in late June 1986.

Both McTiernan and Schwarzenegger lost 25 pounds during the film. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s weight loss was a professional choice while McTiernan lost the weight because he avoided the food in Mexico due to health concerns. Unlike McTiernan, most of the cast and crew suffered from travelers&#x27; diarrhea since the Mexican hotel in which they were living had problems with its water purification. In an interview, Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3:00 a.m. to work out before the day&#x27;s shooting. Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him and would work out only after the other actors were nowhere to be seen.

According to Schwarzenegger, filming was physically demanding. The actor—and former bodybuilder—shipped gym equipment to Mexico and trained intensively every day before shooting began, usually with his co-stars. Screenwriter Jim Thomas was impressed with the training regimen and said: &quot;I think that phrase &#x27;manly men&#x27; was coined [during the production of &quot;Predator&quot;]&quot;. Among other tasks, Schwarzenegger had to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien. In addition, cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required heat lamps to be on all of the time. Cast and crew filmed on rough terrain that, according to the actor, was never flat, &quot;always on a hill. We stood all day long on a hill, one leg down, one leg up. It was terrible.&quot; Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with Kevin Peter Hall, who could not see in the Predator suit. The actor recalled that &quot;when he&#x27;s supposed to slap me around and stay far from my face, all of a sudden, &quot;whap!&quot; There is this hand with claws on it!&quot; Hall stated in an interview that his experience on the film &quot;wasn&#x27;t a movie, it was a survival story for all of us.&quot; For example, in the scene where the Predator chases Dutch, the water was foul, stagnant and full of leeches. Hall could not see out of the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and memorize where everything was. The outfit was difficult to wear because it was heavy and affected his balance.

===Visual effects===
The original Predator creature was created by Richard Edlund of Boss Film Studios and was a disproportionate, ungainly creature with large yellow eyes and a dog-like head, and nowhere near as agile as necessary for what the filmmakers had intended. After a call was put out for a new alien creature costume, creature effects artist Rick Baker put in a bid, but ultimately McTiernan consulted Stan Winston. Winston had previously worked with Schwarzenegger as a visual effects artist on the 1984 film &quot;The Terminator&quot;. While on a plane ride to Fox studios alongside &quot;Aliens&quot; director James Cameron, Winston sketched monster ideas. Cameron suggested he had always wanted to see a creature with mandibles, which became part of the Predator&#x27;s iconic look.

R/Greenberg Associates created the film&#x27;s optical effects, including the alien&#x27;s ability to become invisible, its thermal vision point of view, its glowing blood, and the electrical spark effects.

The invisibility effect was achieved by having someone wearing a bright red suit (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and the blue of the sky) the size of the Predator. The red was removed with chroma key techniques, leaving an empty area. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, the jungle from the second take filled in the empty area. Because the second take was filmed with a wider lens, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape.

For thermal vision, infrared film could not be used because it did not register in the range of body temperature wavelengths. The filmmakers used an Inframetrics thermal video scanner because it gave good heat images of objects and people. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from glow sticks mixed with personal lubricant for texture. The electrical sparks were rotoscoped animation using white paper pins registered on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were composited by the optical crew for the finished effects. Additional visual effects, mainly for the opening title sequence of the Predator arriving on Earth, were supplied by Dream Quest Images (later Oscar-winners for their work on &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot;). The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

===Music===

The score was composed by Alan Silvestri, who was coming off the huge success of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; in 1985. &quot;Predator&quot; was his first major action movie and the score is full of his familiar genre characteristics: heavy horn blasts, staccato string rhythms, and undulating timpani rolls that highlight the action and suspense. Little Richard&#x27;s song &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; is featured in the helicopter en route to the jungle. Mac also recites a few lines from the song as he&#x27;s chasing the Predator after it escapes from their booby trap. Silvestri returned for the sequel, making him the only composer to have scored more than one film in either the &quot;Alien&quot; or &quot;Predator&quot; series.

In 2003, Varèse Sarabande and Fox Music released the soundtrack album as part of its limited release CD Club collection; the album also includes the Elliot Goldenthal arrangement of the 20th Century Fox fanfare used on &quot;Alien 3&quot;.

In 2007, Brian Tyler adapted and composed some of Silvestri&#x27;s themes used in the score of the film &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;.

In 2010, the same year &quot;Predators&quot; featured an adaptation of Silvestri&#x27;s score by John Debney, Intrada Records released the album in a 3000-copy limited edition with remastered sound, many cues combined and renamed, and most notably (as with Intrada&#x27;s release of Basil Poledouris&#x27;s score for &quot;RoboCop&quot;) presenting the original end credits music as recorded (the film versions are mixed differently). This release is notable for having sold out within a day.

In 2018, Henry Jackman adapted and composed Silvestri&#x27;s themes in the score of the film, &quot;The Predator&quot;.

==Release==

==Reception==

===Critical response===
From contemporary reviews, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;grisly and dull, with few surprises&quot;. Dean Lamanna wrote in &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; that &quot;the militarized monster movie tires under its own derivative weight&quot;. Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; proclaimed it &quot;arguably one of the emptiest, feeblest, most derivative scripts ever made as a major studio movie&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was a &quot;slightly above-average actioner that tries to compensate for tissue-thin-plot with ever-more-grisly death sequences and impressive special effects&quot;. Adam Barker of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; found that &quot;unfortunately, special effects have also been substituted for suspense&quot; and that &quot;the early appearance of the Predator makes the final gladiatorial conflict predictable, and the monster&#x27;s multiple transformations also exhaust interest in its final appearance&quot;.

Though finding the creature&#x27;s motivations poorly explained, critic Roger Ebert was more complimentary of the film. He wrote: &quot;&quot;Predator&quot; moves at a breakneck pace, it has strong and simple characterizations, it has good location photography and terrific special effects, and it supplies what it claims to supply: an effective action movie.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Duane Byrge felt that the Predator&#x27;s weaponized attacks relied too heavily on special effects, but allowed that the film is a &quot;well-made, old-style assault movie&quot; and a &quot;full-assault&quot; visual experience.

Chris Hewitt of &quot;Empire&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Predator&quot; has gradually become a sci-fi and action classic. It&#x27;s not difficult to see why. John McTiernan&#x27;s direction is claustrophobic, fluid and assured, staging the action with aplomb but concentrating just as much on tension and atmosphere... A thumping piece of powerhouse cinema.&quot; Peter Suderman of &quot;Reason magazine&quot; noted that &quot;over the last 30-odd years, it has come to be regarded a classic of &#x27;80s action cinema&quot;.

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 80% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Predator&quot;: Part sci-fi, part horror, part action all muscle.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Accolades===

When it came time to recognize the Predator with an Academy Award nomination, the combination of techniques used had the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences officials unsure as to which category the Predator belonged. The mechanical features of the character&#x27;s head suggested the makeup effects category; but, due to the camouflage effect, there was a visual effects aspect to the character, as well. Ultimately, Stan Winston was nominated for an Oscar for Predator in the Best Visual Effects category — just as he had been for &quot;Aliens&quot; — but he and his co-nominees lost to the effects team from &quot;Innerspace&quot;. Though in the same year the academy had categorized the Predator creature as a visual effect, it honored Rick Baker with an Oscar in the Best Makeup category for his work on &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;. This was despite the fact that Harry had been achieved in exactly the same way that the Predator had, with a performer wearing a suit and a mechanical head. In fact, the same actor, Kevin Peter Hall had performed in both suits.

==Legacy==
&quot;Predator&quot; has appeared on a number of &quot;best of&quot; lists. In 2007, C. Robert Cargill of RealNetworks resource Film.com (now merged into MTV Movies) ranked &quot;Predator&quot; as the seventh best film of 1987, calling it &quot;one of the great science fiction horror films, often imitated, but never properly duplicated, not even by its own sequel&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it the 22nd greatest action movie of all time in 2007 and the 14th among &quot;The Best Rock-&#x27;em, Sock-&#x27;em Movies of the Past 25 Years&quot; in 2009, saying: &quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been as manly as he was in this alien-hunting testosterone-fest.&quot; In 2012, &quot;IGN&quot; proclaimed it the 13th greatest action movie of all time. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked it 366th on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. &quot;Predator&quot; was ranked 4th in a 2015 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reader poll of the all-time best action films; it was described by reporter Andy Greene as &quot;freakin&#x27; awesome&quot;. In a 2018 review for &quot;IGN&quot;, William Bibbiani called &quot;Predator&quot; &quot;the most subversive action movie of the 1980s&quot; and cites examples from the film of satire of the action film genre as a whole. In his review, he writes: &quot;&quot;Predator&quot; may be a big, macho action movie, but it&#x27;s also highly critical of the kinds of characters you&#x27;d normally find in big, macho action movies, and the superficial, unquestioningly heroic stories they appear in.&quot;

The line &quot;Get to the choppa&quot; was subsequently associated with Arnold Schwarzenegger, especially when Schwarzenegger said the line again in some of his later appearances, including &quot;The New Celebrity Apprentice&quot; and advertisements for the mobile video game &quot;Mobile Strike&quot;. Lieutenant Andrew Pierce Christian Boeving&#x27;s leading hero from the 2003 action film &quot;When Eagles Strike&quot; was based on Schwarzenegger&#x27;s image in the film. In 2013, NECA released action figure collectables of Major Dutch and the Predator. That same year, &quot;Predator&quot; was converted into 3D for a Blu-ray release.

The Predator makes an appearance in &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon: Wildlands&quot;, in a bonus mission called &quot;The Hunt&quot;. In 2021, the Predator was featured in the video game &quot;Fortnite&quot; as a cosmetic outfit for the character and a hidden enemy in the game, the first of which gave players the associated abilities such as invisibility and the shoulder cannon.

The film inspired Ander Monson&#x27;s 2022 book &quot;Predator: A Memoir, a Movie, an Obsession&quot;.

===Video games===
Dutch Schaefer returned as a playable character in the 1994 beat &#x27;em up video game &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; and the 2020 multiplayer video game &quot;&quot;, Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role in the latter game in paid downloadable content (DLC).

==Sequels and franchise==

The success of &quot;Predator&quot; led 20th Century Fox to finance the three direct sequels over the next thirty-one years, each by different directors, starting with &quot;Predator 2&quot; released in 1990. The second sequel, &quot;Predators&quot;, was released in 2010. A fourth film, &quot;The Predator&quot;, released in 2018, is set between the events of &quot;Predator 2&quot; and &quot;Predators&quot;. A prequel, &quot;Prey&quot;, was released in 2022 as a Hulu original film.

Arnold Schwarzenegger has not reprised his role as Dutch Schaefer in the subsequent sequels; he had been made offers to return but declined on all of these occasions.
A number of these began appearing under the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; title, which brought the Predator creatures together with the creatures of the &quot;Alien&quot; films, and a film series followed with &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; in 2007.

<doc id="230483" wikidata="Q744551" url="?curid=230483" title="Commando (1985 film)">
<text>Commando is a 1985 American action film directed by Mark L. Lester and produced by Joel Silver. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role, alongside Rae Dawn Chong, Alyssa Milano, Vernon Wells, Bill Duke and Dan Hedaya. The musical score was composed by James Horner.

&quot;Commando&quot; was released in the United States on October 4, 1985, where it received praise for the action sequences and humor. The film became a commercial success at the box office and was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Special Effects, but lost to &quot;Back to the Future&quot;.

==Plot==
In upstate California, John Matrix, a former United States Army Special Forces colonel, is informed by his former superior Major General Franklin Kirby that unknown mercenaries have killed all the other members of his former unit. The assassins attack Matrix&#x27;s secluded mountain home and kidnap his young daughter, Jenny. While trying to intercept them, Matrix is tranquilized and abducted by the mercenaries, led by Bennett, an ex-member of Matrix&#x27;s team discharged for excessive violence. Bennett had faked his death and is now working with the mercenaries as revenge against Matrix. Matrix is taken before their commander, Arius, a former South American dictator whom Matrix removed from power. Arius blackmails Matrix into carrying out a political assassination in his home country of Val Verde, where he wishes to lead a military coup.

With Jenny&#x27;s life on the line, Matrix seemingly agrees to fulfill the demand. After boarding a flight to Val Verde, Matrix kills his guard, Henriques, and jumps off the plane just as it is taking off. Knowing that Arius will kill Jenny, regardless of whether or not he does the job, and approximately 11 hours before the plane is scheduled to land, Matrix sets out after Arius&#x27; henchman, Sully. Matrix enlists the aid of an off-duty flight attendant named Cindy, whom he saw Sully harass, and instructs her to follow Sully to a shopping mall. Cindy initially assumes that Matrix is a madman, but after seeing Sully pull a gun on Matrix in the ensuing showdown, she decides to assist him in his endeavor. After a lengthy car chase, Matrix catches up with Sully and drops him off a cliff to his death. After taking a motel key from Sully&#x27;s jacket, Matrix goes to the motel where Cooke, a former Green Beret in Arius&#x27; employ, is staying. After an apparent confrontation, Matrix impales Cooke on a table leg. He then interrogates Cooke on Jenny’s whereabouts, but Cooke dies before he can answer.

With evidence discovered in Cooke&#x27;s car, Matrix and Cindy break into a nearby warehouse owned by Arius that supplies weapons for his army. They learn where Jenny is being held after tracing Arius&#x27; island base on a map of the coastal region. Matrix breaks into a surplus store to equip himself with military weaponry but is arrested by the police. Cindy helps him escape, and after commandeering a seaplane from a nearby marina controlled by Arius, Matrix, and Cindy land the plane off the coast of Arius&#x27; island hideout. Matrix instructs Cindy to contact General Kirby and then proceeds to Arius&#x27;s villa, killing Arius&#x27;s entire army. Arius emerges and engages Matrix in a gunfight until Matrix kills Arius. Jenny escapes to the villa&#x27;s basement but is eventually recaptured by Bennett. Matrix tracks them down, and after a lengthy showdown, Matrix finally kills Bennett by impaling him with a steam pipe. Kirby arrives with a military detachment and asks Matrix to rejoin the unit, but Matrix declines and departs the island aboard the seaplane with Jenny and Cindy.

==Production==
===Development===
Writer Jeph Loeb said his original script was about an Israeli soldier who had renounced violence, but this was deemed too unbelievable. The lead role was originally written for Gene Simmons, but Simmons turned it down. Steven E. de Souza rewrote the script, tailoring it to Schwarzenegger.

===Casting===
Vernon Wells was the first choice to be cast as Captain Bennett, mostly because of his role in &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981). Mark L. Lester stated that Wells was &quot;the only one that could have played against him [Schwarzenegger]&quot;. He further added Bennett was &quot;in love with Matrix but he hated him, too. He wanted to kill him but he was in love with him.&quot;

===Filming===
Principal photography began on April 22, 1985, and wrapped on June 6, 1985, after 45 days of filming. The film was shot on location in California. San Nicolas Island off the coast of Santa Barbara, to which Matrix flies to rescue his daughter, was filmed on the Pacific coast at San Simeon. The barracks that are &quot;attacked&quot; are actually beach properties belonging to the Hearst Castle Estate. The log cabin scenes, where Jenny is abducted, was filmed at Mt. Baldy. The house that Matrix storms at the film&#x27;s climax was actually the former main residence of the Harold Lloyd Estate in the Benedict Canyon district of Beverly Hills. The car chase scene between Sully and Matrix starts on Ventura Blvd and moves into the hills on Benedict Canyon. The Sherman Oaks Galleria, in Sherman Oaks, California, served as the film&#x27;s shopping mall location, and was used for six days after 9pm, after stores closed. The film was originally set to cost $8 million, but it went overbudget and cost $10 million once filming ended.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===

A soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande on December 2, 2003, as part of the label&#x27;s CD Club and was limited to 3,000 copies. The score, composed by James Horner, is notable for its prominent use of steel drums and for reusing motifs from Horner&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; (which would be again recycled to varying degrees in &quot;Red Heat&quot; and &quot;Another 48 Hrs.&quot;).

==Release==
===Home media===
The first DVD of &quot;Commando&quot; was released in region 1 in the United States on May 25, 1999. Common with early DVD releases, the disc featured a non-anamorphic video transfer, a basic 2.0 surround track, and only the US theatrical trailer as an extra. DVDs released in other regions soon followed, some with anamorphic transfers, but the 2001 United Kingdom region 2 DVD was censored by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), with 12 seconds of cuts to an arm severing and closeups of the impaled Bennett. These cuts were brought over from the 1985 original theatrical release. However, a German master was used for the UK DVD, meaning the film was cut even more than it should have been, leading to 56 seconds of cuts instead of the BBFC&#x27;s 12 seconds. If the film had been resubmitted to the BBFC, it would be passed uncut under the BBFC&#x27;s new, more liberal rules. This has proven to be the case as the BBFC&#x27;s website indicates that both versions of the film (the U.S. theatrical cut and the unrated edition) for the DVD were passed on June 11, 2007. With the unrated edition released, the film is available in its entirety, a first for the UK.

On June 5, 2007, 20th Century Fox officially announced that a completely unedited and unrated director&#x27;s cut of the film would be released on region 1 DVD on September 18, 2007. Through seamless branching, this disc not only features an unrated cut (which was claimed to run at 95 minutes, but is only 91 minutes, with 92 seconds of extra footage), but as a bonus, also contains the original 90-minute, R-rated US theatrical version. Aside from this, the DVD is a special edition, featuring an audio commentary from director Mark L. Lester (only on the theatrical cut), additional deleted scenes, a &quot;Pure Action&quot; featurette, a &quot;Let Off Some Steam&quot; featurette, and four photo galleries with over 150 photos. The transfer is anamorphically enhanced and features a 5.1 audio mix.

In April 2008, the 90-minute theatrical version of the film was released to consumers on the high definition Blu-ray Disc format.

On May 5, 2015, as part of the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Commando&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc in a limited edition, collectible metalpak as a Best Buy exclusive. It contains all of the special features that were included in the 2007 DVD release, including the 90-minute theatrical version of the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Commando&quot; was a box office success grossing over $57.5 million against a $9 million budget. The film debuted at number one on the weekend of October 4–6, 1985 in the United States and spent three consecutive weeks at the top position

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 68% based on reviews from 37 critics, with an average rating of 5.80/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The ultimate &#x27;80s Schwarzenegger movie, replete with a threadbare plot, outsized action, and endless one-liners.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 51 out of 100, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

D. J. R. Bruckner of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;two-thirds of this 90-minute film is mayhem unrelieved by humor and untouched by humanity,&quot; and suggested that if sequels were to be made, &quot;more clever writers and subtler directors will have to be found. Even a cinematic comic book needs more artful care than this one was given.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;While it&#x27;s not in the class of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s last hit (&quot;The Terminator&quot;), &quot;Commando&quot; is actually superior to &quot;&quot; because of its deft mixture of humor and action (with most of the action brushed with humor) and its deliberate evasion of any political message.&quot; Patrick Goldstein of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Full of spectacular stunts and shootouts, it&#x27;s a gory crowd-pleaser, directed with jolting efficiency by low-budget veteran Mark L. Lester. If his scenarists had only given Lester a finale with as much explosive punch as his opening scenes, the film could have been a real treat instead of a glorified fireworks display.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and wrote that &quot;Schwarzenegger plays his action scenes both with vengeance and a comic-book laugh, but the mix never gels,&quot; adding, &quot;The concluding battle scenes are wimpy by comparison with the action in &quot;Rambo&quot;. All we see is a half-dozen barracks blown up, shot from four different angles. Wow, look at all of the splintered wood.&quot; Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;starts out fun and ends up dreary—how long can you watch this stony Austrian take target practice?&quot;

===Interviews===
In 1985, Schwarzenegger was interviewed by Gene Siskel about his role in &quot;Commando&quot;. During the interview, Siskel played a clip from the movie showing scenes from where Matrix chased Sully through the mall. In one of the scenes, Matrix picked up an entire telephone booth with Sully in it and flipped it over. Siskel proceeded to ask how much the telephone booth weighed to which Schwarzenegger responded, &quot; and subsequently answered that the stuntman in the booth weighed &quot;. When asked if he could lift , Schwarzenegger responded, &quot;Yeah sure, I mean God I&#x27;ve been lifting my whole life so it&#x27;s no problem&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Commando&quot; inspired many other action films, including &quot;Strike Commando&quot; (1987), &quot;Commando Squad&quot; (1987), and &quot;When Eagles Strike&quot; (2003).

Lester also said: &quot;There&#x27;s a new book that came out about the child African fighters and how they get weapons. And there&#x27;s a section in there about how they show kids the end of &quot;Commando&quot; to get them enthusiastic. I thought &#x27;Wow – that&#x27;s disturbing.&#x27; I guess we don&#x27;t realize the effect our movies have on people.&quot;

==Sequel plans==
A sequel was planned for 1987 and a script that included Schwarzenegger, Chong and Milano was written, but Schwarzenegger declined. Original scriptwriter de Souza has debunked a rumor this script, when the project did not go ahead, morphed into the Die Hard script.

In 2010 Fox announced a remake with David Ayer at the helm, but nothing came out of it. In 2021, a sequel named &quot;Commando: Retribution&quot; was rumored, with Schwarzenegger and Chong both returning.

==Other media== 
Diamond Toymakers released a line of action figures in 1986 in an attempt to cash in on the success of &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot;. Matrix now leads an elite special forces unit (which replaced his old deceased unit from the original film) called C-Team, made up of Spex, Blaster, and Chopper, against the forces of F.E.A.R., led by Psycho (who is based on the character of Bennett) and consisting of Lead-Head, Stalker, and Sawbones. There was an assortment of 4&quot; figures, containing all of the above, a series of 8&quot; figures, consisting of Matrix, Spex, Blaster, Psycho, Lead-Head, and Stalker. Chopper and Sawbones are absent. Finally, there was an 16&quot; John Matrix that came with a pistol, an M16, and a grenade.

<doc id="230484" wikidata="Q43105" url="?curid=230484" title="Mount Elbrus">
<text>Mount Elbrus is the highest mountain in Russia. It is a dormant stratovolcano rising above sea level, and is the highest volcano in the supercontinent of Eurasia, as well as the tenth-most prominent peak in the world. It is situated in the southern Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria in the western extension of Ciscaucasia, and is the highest peak of the Caucasus Mountains.

Elbrus has two summits, both of which are dormant volcanic domes. The taller, western summit is ; the eastern summit is . The earliest recorded ascent of the eastern summit was on 10 July 1829 by a Circassian man named Khillar Khashirov, and the western summit in 1874 by a British expedition led by F. Crauford Grove and including Frederick Gardner, Horace Walker and the Swiss guide Peter Knubel.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Elbrus&quot; seems to have a connection with &quot;Alborz&quot; (also called Elburz), which is also the name of a long mountain range in northern Iran. The name is derived from Avestan &quot;Harā Bərəzaitī&quot;, a legendary mountain in Iranian mythology. &quot;Harā Bərəzaitī&quot; reflects Proto-Iranian *&quot;Harā Bṛzatī&quot;, which was reformed into Middle Persian as &quot;Harborz&quot;, and into Modern Persian as &quot;Alborz&quot;. &quot;Bṛzatī&quot; is the feminine form of the adjective *&quot;bṛzant&quot; (&quot;high&quot;), the reconstructed ancestor of Modern Ossetian &quot;bærzond&quot; (&quot;high&quot;, &quot;peak&quot;), Modern Persian &quot;barz&quot; (&quot;high&quot;), &quot;berāzande&quot; (&quot;elegant&quot;), and &quot;boland&quot; (&quot;high&quot;, &quot;tall&quot;), and Modern Kurdish &quot;barz&quot; (&quot;high&quot;). &quot;Harā&quot; may be interpreted as &quot;watch&quot; or &quot;guard&quot;, from Indo-European *&quot;ser&quot; (&quot;protect&quot;). Circassians use the name &quot;Uash-ha Makhua&quot; which means &quot;The mountain of happiness&quot;, The name &quot;Mingi Taw&quot; used by Karachays and Balkars means &quot;Eternal Mountain&quot; in Turkic languages.

== Geography ==
=== Situation ===
Elbrus is situated in the northwest of the Caucasus, 100 kilometres from the Black Sea and 370 kilometres from the Caspian Sea, which is visible from Elbrus on exceptionally clear days. It rises 5,642 metres above the sea level. Located eleven kilometres north of the Greater Caucasus Watershed, marking the border with Georgia, it is on the border of the Russian republics of Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia. It is the highest peak in both Russia and Europe.

Elbrus is located 65 kilometres southwest of the city of Kislovodsk and 80 kilometers west-southwest of Nalchik. By road it is accessible from European route E50, known to Russians as either the M29 highway or the R217 highway. Nationalpark Elbrus, which is accessed by the A158 road out of Baksan, lies on its southeastern flank. Access permits are required south of Baksan because of border controls.

=== Topography ===
Elbrus is an almost symmetrical dormant volcano, in a vertical plane, with two main peaks, on either side of a pass located at 5,416 metres above sea level: the western summit is the highest point at 5,642 metres above sea level. while the eastern summit rises to 5,621 meters. The crater, 300 to 400 metres in diameter, located at the top of the eastern peak, was gradually filled with snow and ice. The snowfields of the volcano, covering an area of , feed 22 (or 23 depending on the source) main glaciers and 77 secondary glaciers that give rise to the Baksan rivers: Kuban and Malka. Some of these glaciers can reach 400 metres in thickness but all are receding, having lost between 80 and 500 meters in length. The two main ones are called Bolshoi Azaou (&quot;the great Azaou&quot;), with an area of and a length of 9.28 km, and Irik, with an area of and a length of 9.31 km. This glacial activity has formed numerous small but deep lakes.
=== Geology ===
The Caucasus is formed by the northward collision of the Arabian Plate against the Eurasian Plate that causes numerous earthquakes in the region. The fault zone is complex and the large lateral displacement at the level of Anatolia and Iran prevents the creation of a subduction phenomenon and explains the rarity of volcanoes in the mountain range.

Elbrus started to form there 10 million years ago. The ejecta from the volcano covers an area of 260 km2. Fragments of rhyolite and rhyodacite as well as tuff and ignimbrite formations have been found and have been allowed by uranium-lead dating to situate the formation of the main caldera around −700,000 years, probably corresponding to the end of a major eruptive cycle. Geochronological dating has revealed subsequent synchronous eruptive cycles in different focimagmatic deposits of the Greater Caucasus, demonstrating the common geological origin of this volcanic activity. It happens that modest fumaroles still sometimes escape from the eastern flank of Elbrus, at the level of the ancient lava flow of 24 kilometers long oriented from the crater to the north-northeast, and hot springs originate on the slopes of the mountain.

== Eruptive history ==
Mount Elbrus was formed more than 2.5 million years ago. The volcano is currently considered dormant. Elbrus was active in the Holocene, and according to the Global Volcanism Program, the last eruption took place about AD 50. Evidence of recent volcanism includes several lava flows on the mountain, which look fresh, and roughly of volcanic debris. The longest flow extends down the northeast summit, indicative of a large eruption. There are other signs of activity on the volcano, including solfataric activity and hot springs. The western summit has a well-preserved volcanic crater about in diameter.

=== Climate ===
As Elbrus is located in the Northern Hemisphere, the summer period takes place from June to mid-September, with an average of 50% of sunny days favorable to the ascent of the summit. However, the winds, dominated by westerly air masses, can turn violent and temperatures drop very quickly. Above 4000 meters above sea level, even in summer, blizzard conditions with near zero visibility can develop. It is not uncommon for the wind to exceed 100 km/h. In winter, the temperature can drop below −50° at the top. Precipitation increases with altitude.

Mount Elbrus as a whole is warm/hot-summer humid continental (or at the border of oceanic and humid subtropical if the -3 C [27 F] isotherm is used) with hot, moderately wet summers and cold, somewhat dry winters. It is on the border between a &quot;Dfa&quot; and &quot;Dfb&quot; climate, at average temperature 72 F (22 C) in July and August. The summit has an ice-cap climate (Köppen &quot;EF&quot;). Snow is fairly common, at 45 days a year on average, and winter and late fall are driest. Winters are somewhat moderate for the latitude (~45 N, similar to places like Augusta, Maine, St. Paul, Minnesota, or Boise, Idaho, all of which are colder in winter).

==History==
===Greek mythology===

In the &quot;Periplus of the Euxine Sea&quot;, written in Greek in ca. 130, Arrian mentioned a summit in the Caucasus named &quot;Strobilos&quot;: &quot;… as we turned from Astelphos toward Dioscurias, we saw the Caucasus range […] One peak of the Caucasus was pointed out—the name of the peak was Strobilos—where according to the story Prometheus was hanged by Hephaistos on Zeus&#x27; order&quot;. (In Greek mythology, the Titan Prometheus was chained in the Caucasus as a punishment for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mankind.) Arrian&#x27;s &quot;Strobilos&quot;, or Latinized &quot;Strobilus&quot;, was later identified as Elbrus by some writers such as Douglas Freshfield in &quot;The Exploration of the Caucasus&quot; (1896). Freshfield called Elbrus &quot;pinecone-shaped&quot; for the sake of etymology. The ancient Greek word &quot;strobilos&quot; denotes rotating or twisted objects such as a spinning top or a pinecone.

===First Ascents (1829–1930s)===
The lower of the two summits was first ascended on by Khillar Khachirov, a guide for an Imperial Russian army scientific expedition led by General Georgi Emmanuel, and the higher (by about ) in 1874 by an English expedition led by F. Crauford Grove and including Frederick Gardner, Horace Walker, and the Swiss guide Peter Knubel from the Valais canton and guide Ahiya Sottaiev. During the early years of the Soviet Union, mountaineering became a popular sport of the populace, and there was tremendous traffic on the mountain. On 17 March 1936, a group of 33 inexperienced Komsomol members attempted the mountain and ended up suffering four fatalities when they slipped on the ice and fell to their deaths.

===Second World War===
During the Battle of the Caucasus in World War II, the Wehrmacht occupied the area, surrounding the mountain from August 1942 to February 1943 with Gebirgsjäger from the 1st Mountain Division. The Nazi swastika was placed on the summit of Mount Elbrus on 21 August 1942. A possibly apocryphal story tells of a Soviet pilot being given a medal for bombing the main mountaineering hut, &quot;Priyut&quot; 11 (, &quot;Refuge of the 11&quot;), while it was occupied. He was later nominated for a medal for not hitting the hut, but instead, the German fuel supply, leaving the hut standing for future generations. When news reached Adolf Hitler that a detachment of mountaineers was sent by Hubert Lanz, the general officer commanding the German division, to climb to the summit of Elbrus and plant the swastika flag at its top, he reportedly flew into a rage, called the achievement a &quot;stunt&quot; and threatened to court martial the general. Nazi swastikas were removed by USSR army mountaineers on 13 and 17 February 1943. Mt. Elbrus was briefly incorporated into the Georgian SSR from 1944 - 1956.

===Post-WWII===
The Soviet Union encouraged ascents of Elbrus, and in 1956 it was climbed &quot;en masse&quot; by 400 mountaineers to mark the 400th anniversary of the incorporation of Kabardino-Balkaria, the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic where Elbrus was located.

Between 1959 and 1976, a cable car system was built in stages that can take visitors as high as .

====National park====
Since 1986, Elbrus has been incorporated into Prielbrusye National Park, one of the Protected areas of Russia.

==Special ascents==

===By vehicle===
In 1997 a team led by the Russian mountaineer Alexander Abramov took a Land Rover Defender to the summit of the East Peak, entering the Guinness Book of Records. The project took 45 days in total. They were able to drive the vehicle as high as the mountain huts at The Barrels (), but above this they used a pulley system to raise it most of the way. On the way down, a driver lost control of the vehicle and had to jump out. Although he survived the accident, the vehicle crashed onto the rocks and remains below the summit to this day.

In 2016, the Russian climbers Artyom Kuimov and Sergey Baranov entered the Guinness Book of World Records by reaching the summit of Elbrus on ATVs.

===With horses===

In August 1998 a group of climbers from the Karachai-Cherkess Republic were the first in history to climb Mount Elbrus with horses. The horses were Imbir, Daur and Khurzuk, of the Karachai breed, fitted with special horseshoes with removable steel spikes. The organiser of the climb was Klych-Gery Urusov. Six people reached the eastern summit: three Karachai horsemen (Dahir Kappushev, Mohammed Bidzhiev, Murat Dzhatdoev) and three mountaineers (Boris Begeulov, Umar Bairamukov, Leila Albogachieva (Ingush nationality)), with two of the three horses (Daur and Khurzuk).

A second equestrian climb was made in August 1999 by the same Karachai riders, with a Karachai horse (Igilik), reaching the higher western summit.

A third equestrian ascent took place in 2019, by the Karachai horseman Aslan Khubiev with the Karachai horses Boz and Damly, helped by the Balkar guides Aslan Altuev and Askhat Guzoev.

A fourth equestrian ascent took place on 4 September 2020 (see photo below). Two Karachai horsemen, Ramazan Alchakov and Abrek Ediev, and their Russian friend Ivan Kulaga, together with the two Karachai horses Almaz and Dzhigit, reached the western summit.

A fifth equestrian ascent took place on 23 September 2020 by the Karachai horseman Taulan Achabaev and his cousin Rustam Achabaev, together with the stallion Bahr, reaching the higher western summit accompanied by the Balkar guide Aslan Altuev.

===Charity Climbs===
In October 2021, Kazakh scientist Aida Tabelinova climbed Mount Elbrus as part of an international expedition led by Youth Club of the Russian Geographical Society and Rossotrudnichestvo to promote humanitarian cooperation. In 2020 a charity climb for the Global Relief Trust by British Bangladeshi climber Akke Rahman was completed without using supplemental oxygen.

==Travel safety==
After the collapse of the USSR and until the early 2010s, travel to Mount Elbrus became increasingly dangerous due to economic problems, armed conflicts in various republics of Caucasus, and later due to the North Caucasus insurgency. Currently, Mount Elbrus is steadily becoming an important destination of domestic Russian tourism, with 424,000 visitors to the area in 2020.

As of 2019, the United States Department of State has issued a travel advisory against climbing the mountain, as well as travel to the North Caucasian Federal District in general, due to the risk of terrorism and political instability.

In June 2022, the US State Department advised citizens not to travel to Mount Elbrus, due to terrorism, kidnapping, and risk of civil unrest.

==Infrastructure==


===Refuges===
In 1929, eleven scientists erected a small hut at 4,160 metres and called it &quot;Priyut 11&quot; (&quot;Refuge of the 11&quot;). At the same site, a larger hut for 40 people was built in 1932.

A wilderness hut was built in 1933 in the saddle between the two summits but collapsed after only a few years. Its remains can still be seen.

In 1939, the Soviet Intourist travel agency built yet another structure a little above the &quot;Priyut 11&quot; site at 4,200 metres, covered in aluminium siding. It was meant to accommodate western tourists, who were encouraged to climb Mount Elbrus in commercial, guided tours to bring in foreign currency.

Not much later, this hut was converted into a mountain barracks, serving as a base, first for Soviet and later German troops in the Battle of the Caucasus of World War II.

On 16 August 1998, this hut burned down after a cooking stove fell over. After that, the new &quot;Diesel hut&quot; was built in the summer of 2001 a few metres below its ruins, so called because it is located at the site of the former diesel generator station.

In addition, there is accommodation for six people each at the end of the short chairlift above the second cableway section. Painted red and white, these horizontal steel cylinders (called &quot;barrels&quot;, Russian &quot;bochki&quot;), are used as a base and for acclimatization by many mountaineers on their way to the summit. Besides the &quot;barrels&quot;, there are several container-bases accommodation between about 3,800 and 4,200 metres.

===Priyut Hut outhouse===
Mount Elbrus is said to be home to the &#x27;world&#x27;s nastiest&#x27; outhouse which is close to being the highest toilet in Europe, at , next to the old, burnt-out Priyut Hut. The title was conferred by &quot;Outside&quot; magazine following a 1993 search and article. The &quot;outhouse&quot; is surrounded by and covered in ice, perched on the end of a rock.

=== Observatory ===
The Terskol Observatory, an astronomical observatory with the IAU code B18, is located 2.5 km north-west of Terskol village at an altitude of .

==Activities==

=== Ski lifts ===
Three ski lifts take visitors up to an altitude of 3,847 metres.

Until the mid-2000s, the first section was provided by the Elbrouz-1 cable car, construction of which began in 1959. Starting from the Azaou road at 2,180 metres above sea level in the valley, it leads to the old viewpoint (Stari Krougozor) at an altitude of 2,970 metres; at the foot of the terminal tongue of the Mali glacier Azaou, which has retreated since the construction of the facility. Its length is 1,740 metres, with a drop of 650 meters. The second section, built in 1976, leads to the Mir station at an altitude of 3,470 metres. Its length is 1,800 metres, with a drop of 500 metres. Finally, the last stretch is a chairlift single-seater which then makes it possible to avoid an hour&#x27;s walk for hikers to the Garabachi huts, at an altitude of 3,847 metres. Built in the late 1970s, it is 1,000 metres long, with a drop of 250 metres.

In December 2006, the first section of the cable car was modernized to meet safety requirements, thanks to the construction of a new cable car in parallel with the existing one. In August 2009, a new cable car was built to reach the second section. On 27 December 2015, the gondola to go up the third section was put into service, thus becoming the second-highest gondola in Europe after that of Zermatt in Switzerland; which is 3,883 m high. Its capacity is 750 people per hour.

The ski resort is busiest in April and May.

===Mountaineering===
There are a wide variety of routes up the mountain, but the normal route, which is free of crevasses, continues more or less straight up the slope from the end of the cable car system, which takes passengers up to . During the summer, it is not uncommon for 100 people to attempt the summit via this route each day. Winter ascents are rare, and are usually undertaken only by very experienced climbers. Elbrus is notorious for its brutal winter weather, and summit attempts are few and far between. The climb is not technically difficult, but it is physically arduous because of the altitude and the frequent strong winds. The average annual death toll on Elbrus is 15–30, primarily due to &quot;many unorganized and poorly equipped&quot; attempts to reach the mountain&#x27;s summit.

The normal route, on the southern slope, is the easiest, the safest and the fastest, by using the ski lifts to the Garabachi 36 refuges offering 11 cylindrical cabins (the &quot;barrels&quot;) of 6 beds each and a total of 80 berths, with water from the melting glacier in summer, and electric heating. At an hour and a half walk, at an altitude of 4,157 metres, is the Diesel refuge, offering 50 places and built in 2001 on the site of the former refuge of the 11 accidentally burned down on Aug 16, 1998. After an additional two hours of walking, the normal route passes close to the Pastoukhov rocks, which can be reached by a snowmobile. The rest of the ascent to the two main peaks can only be done on foot in about six hours. The route is well signposted; but it can be risky to go more than fifty meters from it because of the few crevasses or in the event of being ill-equipped. A variant allows you to reach the Diesel refuge from the Ice camp, at an altitude of 3,680 metres.

Another route leads to the summit from Kioukiourtliou-Kolbachi (4,639 m) via the Dome of Koupol at 4,912 meters, on the western side of the mountain. This route, much longer, is accessible either from the first section of the cable car by crossing the moraines in a north-west direction via the Khoti Outaou pass then obliquely towards the summit, or from the Khourzouk valley. There is no refuge but the terrain is more suitable for camping.

Other routes by the east from the valley, the glacier and the Iryk pass (3,667 m), or by the north are possible but are more hazardous due to the absence or obsolescence of the installations.

During Soviet times, Mount Elbrus was home to climbing speed competitions and was training for national Himalayan expeditions (1982 and 1989). The best mountaineers tested their endurance during this prestigious event. In September 1987, Vladimir Balyberdine organized the first official race between the refuge and the pass. In 1990, Anatoli Boukreev set a record by climbing from the refuge to the eastern summit in a time of 1 hour and 47 minutes. In 2005, with the growing enthusiasm for extreme sports and the increase in the number of mountaineers in Russia, this tradition was relaunched and a new race was organized between Bochki and the western summit. In 2006, the best mountaineers from the former Soviet republics participated in the competition: Denis Urubko from Kazakhstan, Sergei Seliverstov and Alexander Kerimov from Kyrgyzstan, and Sergei Sourmonin from Russia. For the first time, one of the routes offers a height difference of over 3,000 metres, starting at the Azaou glades at an altitude of 2,400 metres and arriving at the western summit. Denis Ouroubko sets a time of 3 hours 55 minutes and 58 seconds on this course. On the route starting from the Garabachi huts, Svetlana Sharipova is the best female with a time of 3 hours 21 minutes and 29 seconds.

In 1997, two Swedish adventurers, mountaineerings and skiers Jon Wilhelmsson (1976, Ockelbo, Sweden) and  Niklas summited Mount Elbrus, executing a remarkable descent using the Telemark skiing technique. Whether they were the first foreign skiers to achieve this feat remains uncertain. No documented instances of earlier Telemark descents from Mount Elbrus by foreigners have been found.

It is possible to go around Mount Elbrus. The easiest route takes between eight and ten days of hiking, with the crossing of several glaciers and the crossing of many passes. It starts from the village of Baksan in the Kirtyk valley, then passes through the Kirtykaouch pass (3,242 m), descends to the Malka river where it is possible to discover the Sultan Falls from a height of forty metres near the sources. the Jilasu, then connects Khourzouk after the Bourountach pass (3,072 m), and finally crosses the Oullou-Kam river, the Khoti Outaou pass (3,456 m), the Azaou glacier to descend to Terskol and finally return to the point of departure.

In September 2012, an emergency shelter is installed on the &quot;saddle&quot; of Elbrus, between the eastern summit and the western summit, station EG 5300. It was then the highest mountain refuge in Europe. However, the shelter was destroyed by winds in December of the same year. In 2013, a new, more modest emergency shelter, capable of accommodating four to six people, was built 300 metres from the EG 5300 station, by the Russian Mountaineering Federation.

==Elbrus Race==

The first race on Elbrus took place in 1990, with Soviet and American climbers competing. The race was won by Anatoli Boukreev, with Kevin Cooney in second, followed by Patrick Healy. Route Priut 11 () – East (lower) was summited in 1 hour and 47 minutes.

Regular competitions began to take place in 2005, with a choice of two routes: the &quot;classic&quot; climb from &quot;Barrels&quot; at to the western summit () and a long climb, from the Azau Meadow at to the same summit. In 2006, Denis Urubko won the long ascent in 3 hours, 55 minutes, 59 seconds.

On 24 September 2010, under the Artur Hajzer program &quot;Polish Winter Himalayism 2010–2015&quot;, the Polish Mountaineering Association sent a 13-person team for training purposes. Andrzej Bargiel set a new long course record of 3 hours, 23 minutes, 37 seconds.

The record time for the full race, ascent and descent, of the long route is 4:20:45, set on 7 May 2017 by the Swiss-Ecuadorian mountain guide Karl Egloff. Egloff broke the previous record set in September 2014 by Vitaliy Shkel by more than 18 minutes. He reached the summit in 3:24:14, missing Bergiel&#x27;s record ascent-only time by 37 seconds; the race organisation and the International Skyrunning Federation nevertheless consider Egloff&#x27;s ascent a record as well.

The fastest times by a woman on the long route were set by Diana Zelenova (4:30:12 for the ascent in 2017) and Oksana Stefanishina (6:25:23 for the full race in 2015).

<text>The Poincaré group, named after Henri Poincaré (1905), was first defined by Hermann Minkowski (1908) as the isometry group of Minkowski spacetime. It is a ten-dimensional non-abelian Lie group that is of importance as a model in our understanding of the most basic fundamentals of physics.

== Overview ==
The Poincaré group consists of all coordinate transformations of Minkowski space that do not change the spacetime interval between events. For example, if everything were postponed by two hours, including the two events and the path you took to go from one to the other, then the time interval between the events recorded by a stopwatch that you carried with you would be the same. Or if everything were shifted five kilometres to the west, or turned 60 degrees to the right, you would also see no change in the interval. It turns out that the proper length of an object is also unaffected by such a shift.

In total, there are ten degrees of freedom for such transformations. They may be thought of as translation through time or space (four degrees, one per dimension); reflection through a plane (three degrees, the freedom in orientation of this plane); or a &quot;boost&quot; in any of the three spatial directions (three degrees). Composition of transformations is the operation of the Poincaré group, with rotations being produced as the composition of an even number of reflections.

In classical physics, the Galilean group is a comparable ten-parameter group that acts on absolute time and space. Instead of boosts, it features shear mappings to relate co-moving frames of reference.

In general relativity, i.e. under the effects of gravity, Poincaré symmetry applies only locally. A treatment of symmetries in general relativity is not in the scope of this article.

== Poincaré symmetry ==
Poincaré symmetry is the full symmetry of special relativity. It includes:
* &quot;translations&quot; (displacements) in time and space, forming the abelian Lie group of spacetime translations (P);
* &quot;rotations&quot; in space, forming the non-abelian Lie group of three-dimensional rotations (J);
* &quot;boosts&quot;, transformations connecting two uniformly moving bodies (K).

The last two symmetries, J and K, together make the Lorentz group (see also &quot;Lorentz invariance&quot;); the semi-direct product of the spacetime translations group and the Lorentz group then produce the Poincaré group. Objects that are invariant under this group are then said to possess Poincaré invariance or relativistic invariance.

10 generators (in four spacetime dimensions) associated with the Poincaré symmetry, by Noether&#x27;s theorem, imply 10 conservation laws:
* 1 for the energy – associated with translations through time
* 3 for the momentum – associated with translations through spatial dimensions
* 3 for the angular momentum – associated with rotations between spatial dimensions
* 3 for a quantity involving the velocity of the center of mass – associated with hyperbolic rotations between each spatial dimension and time

== Poincaré group ==
The Poincaré group is the group of Minkowski spacetime isometries. It is a ten-dimensional noncompact Lie group. The four-dimensional abelian group of spacetime translations is a normal subgroup, while the six-dimensional Lorentz group is also a subgroup, the stabilizer of the origin. The Poincaré group itself is the minimal subgroup of the affine group which includes all translations and Lorentz transformations. More precisely, it is a semidirect product of the spacetime translations group and the Lorentz group, 
: formula_1
with group multiplication
: formula_2.

Another way of putting this is that the Poincaré group is a group extension of the Lorentz group by a vector representation of it; it is sometimes dubbed, informally, as the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. In turn, it can also be obtained as a group contraction of the de Sitter group , as the de Sitter radius goes to infinity.

Its positive energy unitary irreducible representations are indexed by mass (nonnegative number) and spin (integer or half integer) and are associated with particles in quantum mechanics (see Wigner&#x27;s classification).

In accordance with the Erlangen program, the geometry of Minkowski space is defined by the Poincaré group: Minkowski space is considered as a homogeneous space for the group.

In quantum field theory, the universal cover of the Poincaré group
: formula_3
which may be identified with the double cover
: formula_4
is more important, because representations of formula_5 are not able to describe fields with spin 1/2; i.e. fermions. Here formula_6 is the group of complex formula_7 matrices with unit determinant, isomorphic to the Lorentz-signature spin group formula_8.

== Poincaré algebra ==

The Poincaré algebra is the Lie algebra of the Poincaré group. It is a Lie algebra extension of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. More specifically, the proper (formula_9), orthochronous (formula_10) part of the Lorentz subgroup (its identity component), formula_11, is connected to the identity and is thus provided by the exponentiation formula_12 of this Lie algebra. In component form, the Poincaré algebra is given by the commutation relations:

where formula_13 is the generator of translations, formula_14 is the generator of Lorentz transformations, and formula_15 is the formula_16 Minkowski metric (see Sign convention).

The bottom commutation relation is the (&quot;homogeneous&quot;) Lorentz group, consisting of rotations, formula_17, and boosts, formula_18. In this notation, the entire Poincaré algebra is expressible in noncovariant (but more practical) language as
: formula_19

where the bottom line commutator of two boosts is often referred to as a &quot;Wigner rotation&quot;. The simplification formula_20 permits reduction of the Lorentz subalgebra to formula_21 and efficient treatment of its associated representations. In terms of the physical parameters, we have
: formula_22

The Casimir invariants of this algebra are formula_23 and formula_24 where formula_25 is the Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector; they serve as labels for the representations of the group.

The Poincaré group is the full symmetry group of any relativistic field theory. As a result, all elementary particles fall in representations of this group. These are usually specified by the &quot;four-momentum&quot; squared of each particle (i.e. its mass squared) and the intrinsic quantum numbers formula_26, where formula_27 is the spin quantum number, formula_13 is the parity and formula_29 is the charge-conjugation quantum number. In practice, charge conjugation and parity are violated by many quantum field theories; where this occurs, formula_13 and formula_29 are forfeited. Since CPT symmetry is invariant in quantum field theory, a time-reversal quantum number may be constructed from those given.

As a topological space, the group has four connected components: the component of the identity; the time reversed component; the spatial inversion component; and the component which is both time-reversed and spatially inverted.

== Other dimensions ==
The definitions above can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions in a straightforward manner. The -dimensional Poincaré group is analogously defined by the semi-direct product
: formula_32
with the analogous multiplication
: formula_2.

The Lie algebra retains its form, with indices and now taking values between and . The alternative representation in terms of and has no analogue in higher dimensions.

<text>In physics, Minkowski space (or Minkowski spacetime) () is the main mathematical description of spacetime in the absence of gravitation. It combines inertial space and time manifolds into a four-dimensional model. 

The model helps show how a spacetime interval between any two events is independent of the inertial frame of reference in which they are recorded. Mathematician Hermann Minkowski developed it from the work of Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincaré, and others said it &quot;was grown on experimental physical grounds&quot;. 

Minkowski space is closely associated with Einstein&#x27;s theories of special relativity and general relativity and is the most common mathematical structure by which special relativity is formalized. While the individual components in Euclidean space and time might differ due to length contraction and time dilation, in Minkowski spacetime, all frames of reference will agree on the total interval in spacetime between events. Minkowski space differs from four-dimensional Euclidean space insofar as it treats time differently than the three spatial dimensions.

In 3-dimensional Euclidean space, the isometry group (maps preserving the regular Euclidean distance) is the Euclidean group. It is generated by rotations, reflections and translations. When time is appended as a fourth dimension, the further transformations of translations in time and Lorentz boosts are added, and the group of all these transformations is called the Poincaré group. Minkowski&#x27;s model follows special relativity, where motion causes time dilation changing the scale applied to the frame in motion and shifts the phase of light.

Minkowski space is a pseudo-Euclidean space equipped with an isotropic quadratic form called the spacetime interval or the &quot;Minkowski norm squared&quot;. An event in Minkowski space for which the spacetime interval is zero is on the null cone of the origin, called the light cone in Minkowski space. Using the polarization identity the quadratic form is converted to a symmetric bilinear form called the &quot;Minkowski inner product&quot;, though it is not a geometric inner product. Another misnomer is &quot;Minkowski metric&quot;, but Minkowski space is not a metric space.

The group of transformations for Minkowski space that preserves the spacetime interval (as opposed to the spatial Euclidean distance) is the Lorentz group (as opposed to the Galilean group).

== History ==
=== Complex Minkowski spacetime ===

In his second relativity paper in 1905, Henri Poincaré showed how, by taking time to be an imaginary fourth spacetime coordinate , where is the speed of light and is the imaginary unit, Lorentz transformations can be visualized as ordinary rotations of the four-dimensional Euclidean sphere. The four-dimensional spacetime can be visualized as a four-dimensional space, with each point representing an event in spacetime. The Lorentz transformations can then be thought of as rotations in this four-dimensional space, where the rotation axis corresponds to the direction of relative motion between the two observers and the rotation angle is related to their relative velocity.

To understand this concept, one should consider the coordinates of an event in spacetime represented as a four-vector . A Lorentz transformation is represented by a matrix that acts on the four-vector, changing its components. This matrix can be thought of as a rotation matrix in four-dimensional space, which rotates the four-vector around a particular axis.formula_1

Rotations in planes spanned by two space unit vectors appear in coordinate space as well as in physical spacetime as Euclidean rotations and are interpreted in the ordinary sense. The &quot;rotation&quot; in a plane spanned by a space unit vector and a time unit vector, while formally still a rotation in coordinate space, is a Lorentz boost in physical spacetime with &quot;real&quot; inertial coordinates. The analogy with Euclidean rotations is only partial since the radius of the sphere is actually imaginary, which turns rotations into rotations in hyperbolic space (see hyperbolic rotation).

This idea, which was mentioned only briefly by Poincaré, was elaborated by Minkowski in a paper in German published in 1908 called &quot;The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies&quot;. He reformulated Maxwell equations as a symmetrical set of equations in the four variables combined with redefined vector variables for electromagnetic quantities, and he was able to show directly and very simply their invariance under Lorentz transformation. He also made other important contributions and used matrix notation for the first time in this context.
From his reformulation, he concluded that time and space should be treated equally, and so arose his concept of events taking place in a unified four-dimensional spacetime continuum.

=== Real Minkowski spacetime ===
In a further development in his 1908 &quot;Space and Time&quot; lecture, Minkowski gave an alternative formulation of this idea that used a real time coordinate instead of an imaginary one, representing the four variables of space and time in the coordinate form in a four-dimensional real vector space. Points in this space correspond to events in spacetime. In this space, there is a defined light-cone associated with each point, and events not on the light cone are classified by their relation to the apex as &quot;spacelike&quot; or &quot;timelike&quot;. It is principally this view of spacetime that is current nowadays, although the older view involving imaginary time has also influenced special relativity.

In the English translation of Minkowski&#x27;s paper, the Minkowski metric, as defined below, is referred to as the &quot;line element&quot;. The Minkowski inner product below appears unnamed when referring to orthogonality (which he calls &quot;normality&quot;) of certain vectors, and the Minkowski norm squared is referred to (somewhat cryptically, perhaps this is a translation dependent) as &quot;sum&quot;.

Minkowski&#x27;s principal tool is the Minkowski diagram, and he uses it to define concepts and demonstrate properties of Lorentz transformations (e.g., proper time and length contraction) and to provide geometrical interpretation to the generalization of Newtonian mechanics to relativistic mechanics. For these special topics, see the referenced articles, as the presentation below will be principally confined to the mathematical structure (Minkowski metric and from it derived quantities and the Poincaré group as symmetry group of spacetime) &quot;following&quot; from the invariance of the spacetime interval on the spacetime manifold as consequences of the postulates of special relativity, not to specific application or &quot;derivation&quot; of the invariance of the spacetime interval. This structure provides the background setting of all present relativistic theories, barring general relativity for which flat Minkowski spacetime still provides a springboard as curved spacetime is locally Lorentzian.

Minkowski, aware of the fundamental restatement of the theory which he had made, said
Though Minkowski took an important step for physics, Albert Einstein saw its limitation:
For further historical information see references , and .

== Causal structure ==

Where is velocity, , , and are Cartesian coordinates in 3-dimensional space, is the constant representing the universal speed limit, and is time, the four-dimensional vector is classified according to the sign of . A vector is timelike if , spacelike if , and null or lightlike if . This can be expressed in terms of the sign of , also called scalar product, as well, which depends on the signature. The classification of any vector will be the same in all frames of reference that are related by a Lorentz transformation (but not by a general Poincaré transformation because the origin may then be displaced) because of the invariance of the spacetime interval under Lorentz transformation.

The set of all null vectors at an event of Minkowski space constitutes the light cone of that event. Given a timelike vector , there is a worldline of constant velocity associated with it, represented by a straight line in a Minkowski diagram.

Once a direction of time is chosen, timelike and null vectors can be further decomposed into various classes. For timelike vectors, one has
# future-directed timelike vectors whose first component is positive (tip of vector located in causal future (also called the absolute future) in the figure) and
# past-directed timelike vectors whose first component is negative (causal past (also called the absolute past)).
Null vectors fall into three classes:
# the zero vector, whose components in any basis are (origin),
# future-directed null vectors whose first component is positive (upper light cone), and
# past-directed null vectors whose first component is negative (lower light cone).
Together with spacelike vectors, there are 6 classes in all.

An orthonormal basis for Minkowski space necessarily consists of one timelike and three spacelike unit vectors. If one wishes to work with non-orthonormal bases, it is possible to have other combinations of vectors. For example, one can easily construct a (non-orthonormal) basis consisting entirely of null vectors, called a null basis.

Vector fields are called timelike, spacelike, or null if the associated vectors are timelike, spacelike, or null at each point where the field is defined.

== Properties of time-like vectors ==
Time-like vectors have special importance in the theory of relativity as they correspond to events that are accessible to the observer at (0, 0, 0, 0) with a speed less than that of light. Of most interest are time-like vectors that are &quot;similarly directed&quot;, i.e. all either in the forward or in the backward cones. Such vectors have several properties not shared by space-like vectors. These arise because both forward and backward cones are convex, whereas the space-like region is not convex.

=== Scalar product ===
The scalar product of two time-like vectors and is
formula_2

&quot;Positivity of scalar product&quot;: An important property is that the scalar product of two similarly directed time-like vectors is always positive. This can be seen from the reversed Cauchy–Schwarz inequality below. It follows that if the scalar product of two vectors is zero, then one of these, at least, must be space-like. The scalar product of two space-like vectors can be positive or negative as can be seen by considering the product of two space-like vectors having orthogonal spatial components and times either of different or the same signs.

Using the positivity property of time-like vectors, it is easy to verify that a linear sum with positive coefficients of similarly directed time-like vectors is also similarly directed time-like (the sum remains within the light cone because of convexity).

=== Norm and reversed Cauchy inequality ===
The norm of a time-like vector is defined as
formula_3

&quot;The reversed Cauchy inequality&quot; is another consequence of the convexity of either light cone. For two distinct similarly directed time-like vectors and this inequality is
formula_4
or algebraically,
formula_5

From this, the positive property of the scalar product can be seen.

=== Reversed triangle inequality ===
For two similarly directed time-like vectors and , the inequality is
formula_6
where the equality holds when the vectors are linearly dependent.

The proof uses the algebraic definition with the reversed Cauchy inequality:
formula_7

The result now follows by taking the square root on both sides.

== Mathematical structure ==
It is assumed below that spacetime is endowed with a coordinate system corresponding to an inertial frame. This provides an &quot;origin&quot;, which is necessary for spacetime to be modeled as a vector space. This addition is not required, and more complex treatments analogous to an affine space can remove the extra structure. However, this is not the introductory convention and is not covered here.

For an overview, Minkowski space is a -dimensional real vector space equipped with a non-degenerate, symmetric bilinear form on the tangent space at each point in spacetime, here simply called the &quot;Minkowski inner product&quot;, with metric signature either or . The tangent space at each event is a vector space of the same dimension as spacetime, .

=== Tangent vectors ===

In practice, one need not be concerned with the tangent spaces. The vector space structure of Minkowski space allows for the canonical identification of vectors in tangent spaces at points (events) with vectors (points, events) in Minkowski space itself. See e.g. or These identifications are routinely done in mathematics. They can be expressed formally in Cartesian coordinates as
formula_8
with basis vectors in the tangent spaces defined by
formula_9

Here, and are any two events, and the second basis vector identification is referred to as parallel transport. The first identification is the canonical identification of vectors in the tangent space at any point with vectors in the space itself. The appearance of basis vectors in tangent spaces as first-order differential operators is due to this identification. It is motivated by the observation that a geometrical tangent vector can be associated in a one-to-one manner with a directional derivative operator on the set of smooth functions. This is promoted to a &quot;definition&quot; of tangent vectors in manifolds &quot;not&quot; necessarily being embedded in . This definition of tangent vectors is not the only possible one, as ordinary &quot;n&quot;-tuples can be used as well.
A tangent vector at a point may be defined, here specialized to Cartesian coordinates in Lorentz frames, as column vectors associated to &quot;each&quot; Lorentz frame related by Lorentz transformation such that the vector in a frame related to some frame by transforms according to . This is the &quot;same&quot; way in which the coordinates transform. Explicitly,
formula_10

This definition is equivalent to the definition given above under a canonical isomorphism.
For some purposes, it is desirable to identify tangent vectors at a point with &quot;displacement vectors&quot; at , which is, of course, admissible by essentially the same canonical identification. The identifications of vectors referred to above in the mathematical setting can correspondingly be found in a more physical and explicitly geometrical setting in . They offer various degrees of sophistication (and rigor) depending on which part of the material one chooses to read.

=== Metric signature ===
The metric signature refers to which sign the Minkowski inner product yields when given space (&quot;spacelike&quot; to be specific, defined further down) and time basis vectors (&quot;timelike&quot;) as arguments. Further discussion about this theoretically inconsequential but practically necessary choice for purposes of internal consistency and convenience is deferred to the hide box below. See also the page treating sign convention in Relativity. 
In general, but with several exceptions, mathematicians and general relativists prefer spacelike vectors to yield a positive sign, , while particle physicists tend to prefer timelike vectors to yield a positive sign, . Authors covering several areas of physics, e.g. Steven Weinberg and Landau and Lifshitz ( and respectively) stick to one choice regardless of topic. Arguments for the former convention include &quot;continuity&quot; from the Euclidean case corresponding to the non-relativistic limit . Arguments for the latter include that minus signs, otherwise ubiquitous in particle physics, go away. Yet other authors, especially of introductory texts, e.g. , do &quot;not&quot; choose a signature at all, but instead, opt to coordinatize spacetime such that the time &quot;coordinate&quot; (but not time itself!) is imaginary. This removes the need for the &quot;explicit&quot; introduction of a metric tensor (which may seem like an extra burden in an introductory course), and one needs &quot;not&quot; be concerned with covariant vectors and contravariant vectors (or raising and lowering indices) to be described below. The inner product is instead affected by a straightforward extension of the dot product in to . This works in the flat spacetime of special relativity, but not in the curved spacetime of general relativity, see (who, by the way use ). MTW also argues that it hides the true &quot;indefinite&quot; nature of the metric and the true nature of Lorentz boosts, which are not rotations. It also needlessly complicates the use of tools of differential geometry that are otherwise immediately available and useful for geometrical description and calculation – even in the flat spacetime of special relativity, e.g. of the electromagnetic field.
=== Terminology ===
Mathematically associated with the bilinear form is a tensor of type at each point in spacetime, called the &quot;Minkowski metric&quot;. The Minkowski metric, the bilinear form, and the Minkowski inner product are all the same object; it is a bilinear function that accepts two (contravariant) vectors and returns a real number. In coordinates, this is the matrix representing the bilinear form.

For comparison, in general relativity, a Lorentzian manifold is likewise equipped with a metric tensor , which is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on the tangent space at each point of . In coordinates, it may be represented by a matrix &quot;depending on spacetime position&quot;. Minkowski space is thus a comparatively simple special case of a Lorentzian manifold. Its metric tensor is in coordinates with the same symmetric matrix at every point of , and its arguments can, per above, be taken as vectors in spacetime itself.

Introducing more terminology (but not more structure), Minkowski space is thus a pseudo-Euclidean space with total dimension and signature or . Elements of Minkowski space are called events. Minkowski space is often denoted or to emphasize the chosen signature, or just . It is an example of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

Then mathematically, the metric is a bilinear form on an abstract four-dimensional real vector space , that is,
formula_11
where has signature , and signature is a coordinate-invariant property of . The space of bilinear maps forms a vector space which can be identified with formula_12, and may be equivalently viewed as an element of this space. By making a choice of orthonormal basis formula_13, formula_14 can be identified with the space formula_15. The notation is meant to emphasize the fact that and formula_16 are not just vector spaces but have added structure. formula_17.

An interesting example of non-inertial coordinates for (part of) Minkowski spacetime is the Born coordinates. Another useful set of coordinates is the light-cone coordinates.

=== Pseudo-Euclidean metrics ===

The Minkowski inner product is not an inner product, since it has non-zero null vectors. Since it is not a definite bilinear form it is called &quot;indefinite&quot;.

The Minkowski metric is the metric tensor of Minkowski space. It is a pseudo-Euclidean metric, or more generally, a &quot;constant&quot; pseudo-Riemannian metric in Cartesian coordinates. As such, it is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form, a type tensor. It accepts two arguments , vectors in , the tangent space at in . Due to the above-mentioned canonical identification of with itself, it accepts arguments with both and in .

As a notational convention, vectors in , called 4-vectors, are denoted in italics, and not, as is common in the Euclidean setting, with boldface . The latter is generally reserved for the -vector part (to be introduced below) of a -vector.

The definition 
formula_18
yields an inner product-like structure on , previously and also henceforth, called the &quot;Minkowski inner product&quot;, similar to the Euclidean inner product, but it describes a different geometry. It is also called the &quot;relativistic dot product&quot;. If the two arguments are the same,
formula_19
the resulting quantity will be called the &quot;Minkowski norm squared&quot;. The Minkowski inner product satisfies the following properties.

; Linearity in the first argument
: formula_20
; Symmetry
: formula_21
; Non-degeneracy
: formula_22

The first two conditions imply bilinearity. 

The most important feature of the inner product and norm squared is that &quot;these are quantities unaffected by Lorentz transformations&quot;. In fact, it can be taken as the defining property of a Lorentz transformation in that it preserves the inner product (i.e. the value of the corresponding bilinear form on two vectors). This approach is taken more generally for &quot;all&quot; classical groups definable this way in classical group. There, the matrix is identical in the case (the Lorentz group) to the matrix to be displayed below.

===Orthogonality===

Minkowski space is constructed so that the speed of light will be the same constant regardless of the reference frame in which it is measured. This property results from the relation of the time axis to a space axis. Two events &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are orthogonal when the bilinear form is zero for them: .

When both &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are both space-like, then they are perpendicular, but if one is time-like and the other space-like, then the relation is hyperbolic orthogonality. The relation is preserved in a change of reference frames and consequently the computation of light speed yields a constant result. The change of reference frame is called a Lorentz boost and in mathematics it is a hyperbolic rotation. Each reference frame is associated with a hyperbolic angle, which is zero for the rest frame in Minkowski space. Such a hyperbolic angle has been labelled rapidity since it is associated with the speed of the frame.

=== Minkowski metric ===

From the second postulate of special relativity, together with homogeneity of spacetime and isotropy of space, it follows that the spacetime interval between two arbitrary events called and is:
formula_23
This quantity is not consistently named in the literature. The interval is sometimes referred to as the square root of the interval as defined here.

The invariance of the interval under coordinate transformations between inertial frames follows from the invariance of
formula_24
provided the transformations are linear. This quadratic form can be used to define a bilinear form
formula_25
via the polarization identity. This bilinear form can in turn be written as
formula_26
where is a formula_27 matrix associated with . While possibly confusing, it is common practice to denote with just . The matrix is read off from the explicit bilinear form as
formula_28
and the bilinear form
formula_29
with which this section started by assuming its existence, is now identified.

For definiteness and shorter presentation, the signature is adopted below. This choice (or the other possible choice) has no (known) physical implications. The symmetry group preserving the bilinear form with one choice of signature is isomorphic (under the map given here) with the symmetry group preserving the other choice of signature. This means that both choices are in accord with the two postulates of relativity. Switching between the two conventions is straightforward. If the metric tensor has been used in a derivation, go back to the earliest point where it was used, substitute for , and retrace forward to the desired formula with the desired metric signature.

=== Standard basis ===
A standard or orthonormal basis for Minkowski space is a set of four mutually orthogonal vectors such that
formula_30
and for which formula_31 when formula_32

These conditions can be written compactly in the form
formula_33

Relative to a standard basis, the components of a vector are written where the Einstein notation is used to write . The component is called the timelike component of while the other three components are called the spatial components. The spatial components of a -vector may be identified with a -vector .

In terms of components, the Minkowski inner product between two vectors and is given by

formula_34
and
formula_35

Here lowering of an index with the metric was used.

There are many possible choices of standard basis obeying the condition formula_36 Any two such bases are related in some sense by a Lorentz transformation, either by a change-of-basis matrix formula_37, a real matrix satisfying
formula_38
or , a linear map on the abstract vector space satisfying, for any pair of vectors , ,
formula_39

Then if two different bases exist, and , formula_40 can be represented as formula_40 or formula_42. While it might be tempting to think of formula_37 and as the same thing, mathematically, they are elements of different spaces, and act on the space of standard bases from different sides.

==== Raising and lowering of indices ====
Technically, a non-degenerate bilinear form provides a map between a vector space and its dual; in this context, the map is between the tangent spaces of and the cotangent spaces of . At a point in , the tangent and cotangent spaces are dual vector spaces (so the dimension of the cotangent space at an event is also ). Just as an authentic inner product on a vector space with one argument fixed, by Riesz representation theorem, may be expressed as the action of a linear functional on the vector space, the same holds for the Minkowski inner product of Minkowski space.

Thus if are the components of a vector in tangent space, then are the components of a vector in the cotangent space (a linear functional). Due to the identification of vectors in tangent spaces with vectors in itself, this is mostly ignored, and vectors with lower indices are referred to as covariant vectors. In this latter interpretation, the covariant vectors are (almost always implicitly) identified with vectors (linear functionals) in the dual of Minkowski space. The ones with upper indices are contravariant vectors. In the same fashion, the inverse of the map from tangent to cotangent spaces, explicitly given by the inverse of in matrix representation, can be used to define raising of an index. The components of this inverse are denoted . It happens that . These maps between a vector space and its dual can be denoted (eta-flat) and (eta-sharp) by the musical analogy.

Contravariant and covariant vectors are geometrically very different objects. The first can and should be thought of as arrows. A linear function can be characterized by two objects: its kernel, which is a hyperplane passing through the origin, and its norm. Geometrically thus, covariant vectors should be viewed as a set of hyperplanes, with spacing depending on the norm (bigger = smaller spacing), with one of them (the kernel) passing through the origin. The mathematical term for a covariant vector is 1-covector or 1-form (though the latter is usually reserved for covector &quot;fields&quot;).

One quantum mechanical analogy explored in the literature is that of a de Broglie wave (scaled by a factor of Planck&#x27;s reduced constant) associated with a momentum four-vector to illustrate how one could imagine a covariant version of a contravariant vector. The inner product of two contravariant vectors could equally well be thought of as the action of the covariant version of one of them on the contravariant version of the other. The inner product is then how many times the arrow pierces the planes. The mathematical reference, , offers the same geometrical view of these objects (but mentions no piercing).

The electromagnetic field tensor is a differential 2-form, which geometrical description can as well be found in MTW.

One may, of course, ignore geometrical views altogether (as is the style in e.g. and ) and proceed algebraically in a purely formal fashion. The time-proven robustness of the formalism itself, sometimes referred to as index gymnastics, ensures that moving vectors around and changing from contravariant to covariant vectors and vice versa (as well as higher order tensors) is mathematically sound. Incorrect expressions tend to reveal themselves quickly.

==== Coordinate free raising and lowering ====
Given a bilinear form formula_44, the lowered version of a vector can be thought of as the partial evaluation of formula_45, that is, there is an associated partial evaluation map
formula_46

The lowered vector formula_47 is then the dual map formula_48. Note it does not matter which argument is partially evaluated due to the symmetry of formula_45.

Non-degeneracy is then equivalent to injectivity of the partial evaluation map, or equivalently non-degeneracy indicates that the kernel of the map is trivial. In finite dimension, as is the case here, and noting that the dimension of a finite-dimensional space is equal to the dimension of the dual, this is enough to conclude the partial evaluation map is a linear isomorphism from formula_50 to formula_51. This then allows the definition of the inverse partial evaluation map,
formula_52
which allows the inverse metric to be defined as
formula_53
where the two different usages of formula_54 can be told apart by the argument each is evaluated on. This can then be used to raise indices. If a coordinate basis is used, the metric is indeed the matrix inverse to .

==== Formalism of the Minkowski metric ====
The present purpose is to show semi-rigorously how &quot;formally&quot; one may apply the Minkowski metric to two vectors and obtain a real number, i.e. to display the role of the differentials and how they disappear in a calculation. The setting is that of smooth manifold theory, and concepts such as convector fields and exterior derivatives are introduced.
A full-blown version of the Minkowski metric in coordinates as a tensor field on spacetime has the appearance
formula_55

Explanation: The coordinate differentials are 1-form fields. They are defined as the exterior derivative of the coordinate functions . These quantities evaluated at a point provide a basis for the cotangent space at . The tensor product (denoted by the symbol ) yields a tensor field of type , i.e. the type that expects two contravariant vectors as arguments. On the right-hand side, the symmetric product (denoted by the symbol or by juxtaposition) has been taken. The equality holds since, by definition, the Minkowski metric is symmetric. The notation on the far right is also sometimes used for the related, but different, line element. It is &quot;not&quot; a tensor. For elaboration on the differences and similarities, see 

&quot;Tangent&quot; vectors are, in this formalism, given in terms of a basis of differential operators of the first order,
formula_56
where is an event. This operator applied to a function gives the directional derivative of at in the direction of increasing with fixed. They provide a basis for the tangent space at .

The exterior derivative of a function is a covector field, i.e. an assignment of a cotangent vector to each point , by definition such that
formula_57
for each vector field . A vector field is an assignment of a tangent vector to each point . In coordinates can be expanded at each point in the basis given by the . Applying this with , the coordinate function itself, and , called a &quot;coordinate vector field&quot;, one obtains
formula_58

Since this relation holds at each point , the provide a basis for the cotangent space at each and the bases and are dual to each other,
formula_59
at each . Furthermore, one has
formula_60
for general one-forms on a tangent space and general tangent vectors . (This can be taken as a definition, but may also be proved in a more general setting.)

Thus when the metric tensor is fed two vectors fields , , both expanded in terms of the basis coordinate vector fields, the result is
formula_61
where , are the &quot;component functions&quot; of the vector fields. The above equation holds at each point , and the relation may as well be interpreted as the Minkowski metric at applied to two tangent vectors at .

As mentioned, in a vector space, such as modeling the spacetime of special relativity, tangent vectors can be canonically identified with vectors in the space itself, and vice versa. This means that the tangent spaces at each point are canonically identified with each other and with the vector space itself. This explains how the right-hand side of the above equation can be employed directly, without regard to the spacetime point the metric is to be evaluated and from where (which tangent space) the vectors come from.

This situation changes in general relativity. There one has
formula_62
where now , i.e., is still a metric tensor but now depending on spacetime and is a solution of Einstein&#x27;s field equations. Moreover, &quot;must&quot; be tangent vectors at spacetime point and can no longer be moved around freely.
=== Chronological and causality relations ===
Let . Here,
# chronologically precedes if is future-directed timelike. This relation has the transitive property and so can be written . 
# causally precedes if is future-directed null or future-directed timelike. It gives a partial ordering of spacetime and so can be written .

Suppose is timelike. Then the simultaneous hyperplane for is . Since this hyperplane varies as varies, there is a relativity of simultaneity in Minkowski space.

== Generalizations ==

A Lorentzian manifold is a generalization of Minkowski space in two ways. The total number of spacetime dimensions is not restricted to be ( or more) and a Lorentzian manifold need not be flat, i.e. it allows for curvature.

=== Complexified Minkowski space ===
Complexified Minkowski space is defined as . Its real part is the Minkowski space of four-vectors, such as the four-velocity and the four-momentum, which are independent of the choice of orientation of the space. The imaginary part, on the other hand, may consist of four pseudovectors, such as angular velocity and magnetic moment, which change their direction with a change of orientation. A pseudoscalar is introduced, which also changes sign with a change of orientation. Thus, elements of are independent of the choice of the orientation.

The inner product-like structure on is defined as for any . A relativistic pure spin of an electron or any half spin particle is described by as , where is the four-velocity of the particle, satisfying and is the 4D spin vector, which is also the Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector satisfying and .

=== Generalized Minkowski space ===
Minkowski space refers to a mathematical formulation in four dimensions. However, the mathematics can easily be extended or simplified to create an analogous generalized Minkowski space in any number of dimensions. If , -dimensional Minkowski space is a vector space of real dimension on which there is a constant Minkowski metric of signature or . These generalizations are used in theories where spacetime is assumed to have more or less than dimensions. String theory and M-theory are two examples where . In string theory, there appears conformal field theories with spacetime dimensions.

de Sitter space can be formulated as a submanifold of generalized Minkowski space as can the model spaces of hyperbolic geometry (see below).

=== Curvature ===

As a flat spacetime, the three spatial components of Minkowski spacetime always obey the Pythagorean Theorem. Minkowski space is a suitable basis for special relativity, a good description of physical systems over finite distances in systems without significant gravitation. However, in order to take gravity into account, physicists use the theory of general relativity, which is formulated in the mathematics of differential geometry of differential manifolds. When this geometry is used as a model of spacetime, it is known as curved spacetime.

Even in curved spacetime, Minkowski space is still a good description in an infinitesimal region surrounding any point (barring gravitational singularities). More abstractly, it can be said that in the presence of gravity spacetime is described by a curved 4-dimensional manifold for which the tangent space to any point is a 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Thus, the structure of Minkowski space is still essential in the description of general relativity.

== Geometry ==

The meaning of the term &quot;geometry&quot; for the Minkowski space depends heavily on the context. Minkowski space is not endowed with Euclidean geometry, and not with any of the generalized Riemannian geometries with intrinsic curvature, those exposed by the &quot;model spaces&quot; in hyperbolic geometry (negative curvature) and the geometry modeled by the sphere (positive curvature). The reason is the indefiniteness of the Minkowski metric. Minkowski space is, in particular, not a metric space and not a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric. However, Minkowski space contains submanifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric yielding hyperbolic geometry.

Model spaces of hyperbolic geometry of low dimension, say 2 or 3, &quot;cannot&quot; be isometrically embedded in Euclidean space with one more dimension, i.e. formula_63 or formula_64 respectively, with the Euclidean metric formula_65, preventing easy visualization. By comparison, model spaces with positive curvature are just spheres in Euclidean space of one higher dimension. Hyperbolic spaces &quot;can&quot; be isometrically embedded in spaces of one more dimension when the embedding space is endowed with the Minkowski metric formula_45.

Define formula_67to be the upper sheet (formula_68) of the hyperboloid
formula_69
in generalized Minkowski space formula_70 of spacetime dimension formula_71 This is one of the surfaces of transitivity of the generalized Lorentz group. The induced metric on this submanifold,
formula_72
the pullback of the Minkowski metric formula_45 under inclusion, is a Riemannian metric. With this metric formula_74 is a Riemannian manifold. It is one of the model spaces of Riemannian geometry, the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space. It is a space of constant negative curvature formula_75. The 1 in the upper index refers to an enumeration of the different model spaces of hyperbolic geometry, and the for its dimension. A formula_76 corresponds to the Poincaré disk model, while formula_77 corresponds to the Poincaré half-space model of dimension formula_78

=== Preliminaries ===
In the definition above formula_79 is the inclusion map and the superscript star denotes the pullback. The present purpose is to describe this and similar operations as a preparation for the actual demonstration that formula_74 actually is a hyperbolic space.

=== Hyperbolic stereographic projection ===

In order to exhibit the metric, it is necessary to pull it back via a suitable &quot;parametrization&quot;. A parametrization of a submanifold of a manifold is a map whose range is an open subset of . If has the same dimension as , a parametrization is just the inverse of a coordinate map . The parametrization to be used is the inverse of &quot;hyperbolic stereographic projection&quot;. This is illustrated in the figure to the right for . It is instructive to compare to stereographic projection for spheres.

Stereographic projection and its inverse are given by
formula_81
where, for simplicity, . The are coordinates on and the are coordinates on .


=== Pulling back the metric ===
One has
formula_82
and the map
formula_83

The pulled back metric can be obtained by straightforward methods of calculus;
formula_84

One computes according to the standard rules for computing differentials (though one is really computing the rigorously defined exterior derivatives),
formula_85
and substitutes the results into the right hand side. This yields
formula_86

This last equation shows that the metric on the ball is identical to the Riemannian metric in the Poincaré ball model, another standard model of hyperbolic geometry.

<text>In physics and mathematics, the Lorentz group is the group of all Lorentz transformations of Minkowski spacetime, the classical and quantum setting for all (non-gravitational) physical phenomena. The Lorentz group is named for the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz.

For example, the following laws, equations, and theories respect Lorentz symmetry:
* The kinematical laws of special relativity
* Maxwell&#x27;s field equations in the theory of electromagnetism
* The Dirac equation in the theory of the electron
* The Standard Model of particle physics

The Lorentz group expresses the fundamental symmetry of space and time of all known fundamental laws of nature. In small enough regions of spacetime where gravitational variances are negligible, physical laws are Lorentz invariant in the same manner as special relativity.

== Basic properties ==
The Lorentz group is a subgroup of the Poincaré group—the group of all isometries of Minkowski spacetime. Lorentz transformations are, precisely, isometries that leave the origin fixed. Thus, the Lorentz group is the isotropy subgroup with respect to the origin of the isometry group of Minkowski spacetime. For this reason, the Lorentz group is sometimes called the homogeneous Lorentz group while the Poincaré group is sometimes called the &quot;inhomogeneous Lorentz group&quot;. Lorentz transformations are examples of linear transformations; general isometries of Minkowski spacetime are affine transformations.

=== Physics definition ===
Assume two inertial reference frames and , and two points , , the Lorentz group is the set of all the transformations between the two reference frames that preserve the speed of light propagating between the two points:
: formula_1
In matrix form these are all the linear transformations such that:
: formula_2
These are then called Lorentz transformations.

=== Mathematical definition ===
Mathematically, the Lorentz group may be described as the indefinite orthogonal group , the matrix Lie group that preserves the quadratic form
: formula_3

on (the vector space equipped with this quadratic form is sometimes written ). This quadratic form is, when put on matrix form (see &quot;Classical orthogonal group&quot;), interpreted in physics as the metric tensor of Minkowski spacetime.

=== Note on Notation ===

Both and are in common use for the Lorentz group. The first refers to matrices which preserve a metric of signature with one + and three -&#x27;s, and the second refers to a metric of signature with one - and three +&#x27;s. Because the overall sign of the metric is irrelevant in the defining equation, the resulting groups of matrices are identical. There appears to be a modern push from some sectors to adopt (1,3) notation versus (3,1), but the latter still finds plenty of use in current practice, and a great deal of the historical literature employed it. Everything described in this article applies to O(3,1) notation as well, mutatis mutandis. These considerations extend to related definitions as well (ex. vs . 

=== Mathematical properties ===
The Lorentz group is a six-dimensional noncompact non-abelian real Lie group that is not connected. The four connected components are not simply connected. The identity component (i.e., the component containing the identity element) of the Lorentz group is itself a group, and is often called the restricted Lorentz group, and is denoted . The restricted Lorentz group consists of those Lorentz transformations that preserve both the orientation of space and the direction of time. Its fundamental group has order 2, and its universal cover, the indefinite spin group , is isomorphic to both the special linear group and to the symplectic group . These isomorphisms allow the Lorentz group to act on a large number of mathematical structures important to physics, most notably spinors. Thus, in relativistic quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, it is very common to call the Lorentz group, with the understanding that is a specific representation (the vector representation) of it.

A recurrent representation of the action of the Lorentz group on Minkowski space uses biquaternions, which form a composition algebra. The isometry property of Lorentz transformations holds according to the composition property .

Another property of the Lorentz group is &quot;conformality&quot; or preservation of angles. Lorentz boosts act by hyperbolic rotation of a spacetime plane, and such &quot;rotations&quot; preserve hyperbolic angle, the measure of rapidity used in relativity. Therefore, the Lorentz group is a subgroup of the conformal group of spacetime.

Note that this article refers to as the &quot;Lorentz group&quot;, as the &quot;proper Lorentz group&quot;, and as the &quot;restricted Lorentz group&quot;. Many authors (especially in physics) use the name &quot;Lorentz group&quot; for (or sometimes even ) rather than . When reading such authors it is important to keep clear exactly which they are referring to.

Because it is a Lie group, the Lorentz group is a group and also has a topological description as a smooth manifold. As a manifold, it has four connected components. Intuitively, this means that it consists of four topologically separated pieces.

The four connected components can be categorized by two transformation properties its elements have:
* Some elements are reversed under time-inverting Lorentz transformations, for example, a future-pointing timelike vector would be inverted to a past-pointing vector
* Some elements have orientation reversed by improper Lorentz transformations, for example, certain vierbein (tetrads)

Lorentz transformations that preserve the direction of time are called . The subgroup of orthochronous transformations is often denoted . Those that preserve orientation are called proper, and as linear transformations they have determinant . (The improper Lorentz transformations have determinant .) The subgroup of proper Lorentz transformations is denoted .

The subgroup of all Lorentz transformations preserving both orientation and direction of time is called the proper, orthochronous Lorentz group or restricted Lorentz group, and is denoted by .

The set of the four connected components can be given a group structure as the quotient group , which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group. Every element in can be written as the semidirect product of a proper, orthochronous transformation and an element of the discrete group

where &quot;P&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are the parity and time reversal operators:
: .

Thus an arbitrary Lorentz transformation can be specified as a proper, orthochronous Lorentz transformation along with a further two bits of information, which pick out one of the four connected components. This pattern is typical of finite-dimensional Lie groups.

== Restricted Lorentz group ==
The restricted Lorentz group is the identity component of the Lorentz group, which means that it consists of all Lorentz transformations that can be connected to the identity by a continuous curve lying in the group. The restricted Lorentz group is a connected normal subgroup of the full Lorentz group with the same dimension, in this case with dimension six.

The restricted Lorentz group is generated by ordinary spatial rotations and Lorentz boosts (which are rotations in a hyperbolic space that includes a time-like direction). Since every proper, orthochronous Lorentz transformation can be written as a product of a rotation (specified by 3 real parameters) and a boost (also specified by 3 real parameters), it takes 6 real parameters to specify an arbitrary proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation. This is one way to understand why the restricted Lorentz group is six-dimensional. (See also the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group.)

The set of all rotations forms a Lie subgroup isomorphic to the ordinary rotation group. The set of all boosts, however, does &quot;not&quot; form a subgroup, since composing two boosts does not, in general, result in another boost. (Rather, a pair of non-colinear boosts is equivalent to a boost and a rotation, and this relates to Thomas rotation.) A boost in some direction, or a rotation about some axis, generates a one-parameter subgroup.

=== Surfaces of transitivity ===

If a group acts on a space , then a surface is a surface of transitivity if is invariant under (i.e., ) and for any two points there is a such that . By definition of the Lorentz group, it preserves the quadratic form 
: formula_4

The surfaces of transitivity of the orthochronous Lorentz group , acting on flat spacetime are the following:
* is the upper branch of a hyperboloid of two sheets. Points on this sheet are separated from the origin by a future time-like vector.
* is the lower branch of this hyperboloid. Points on this sheet are the past time-like vectors.
* is the upper branch of the light cone, the future light cone.
* is the lower branch of the light cone, the past light cone.
* is a hyperboloid of one sheet. Points on this sheet are space-like separated from the origin.
* The origin .

These surfaces are , so the images are not faithful, but they are faithful for the corresponding facts about . For the full Lorentz group, the surfaces of transitivity are only four since the transformation takes an upper branch of a hyperboloid (cone) to a lower one and vice versa.

==== As symmetric spaces ====
An equivalent way to formulate the above surfaces of transitivity is as a symmetric space in the sense of Lie theory. For example, the upper sheet of the hyperboloid can be written as the quotient space , due to the orbit-stabilizer theorem. Furthermore, this upper sheet also provides a model for three-dimensional hyperbolic space.

=== Representations of the Lorentz group ===
These observations constitute a good starting point for finding all infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the Lorentz group, in fact, of the Poincaré group, using the method of induced representations. One begins with a &quot;standard vector&quot;, one for each surface of transitivity, and then ask which subgroup preserves these vectors. These subgroups are called little groups by physicists. The problem is then essentially reduced to the easier problem of finding representations of the little groups. For example, a standard vector in one of the hyperbolas of two sheets could be suitably chosen as . For each , the vector pierces exactly one sheet. In this case the little group is , the rotation group, all of whose representations are known. The precise infinite-dimensional unitary representation under which a particle transforms is part of its classification. Not all representations can correspond to physical particles (as far as is known). Standard vectors on the one-sheeted hyperbolas would correspond to tachyons. Particles on the light cone are photons, and more hypothetically, gravitons. The &quot;particle&quot; corresponding to the origin is the vacuum.

== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ==
Several other groups are either homomorphic or isomorphic to the restricted Lorentz group . These homomorphisms play a key role in explaining various phenomena in physics.
* The special linear group is a double covering of the restricted Lorentz group. This relationship is widely used to express the Lorentz invariance of the Dirac equation and the covariance of spinors. In other words, the (restricted) Lorentz group is isomorphic to 
* The symplectic group is isomorphic to ; it is used to construct Weyl spinors, as well as to explain how spinors can have a mass.
* The spin group is isomorphic to ; it is used to explain spin and spinors in terms of the Clifford algebra, thus making it clear how to generalize the Lorentz group to general settings in Riemannian geometry, including theories of supergravity and string theory.
* The restricted Lorentz group is isomorphic to the projective special linear group which is, in turn, isomorphic to the Möbius group, the symmetry group of conformal geometry on the Riemann sphere. This relationship is central to the classification of the subgroups of the Lorentz group according to an earlier classification scheme developed for the Möbius group.

=== Weyl representation ===
The Weyl representation or spinor map is a pair of surjective homomorphisms from to . They form a matched pair under parity transformations, corresponding to left and right chiral spinors.

One may define an action of on Minkowski spacetime by writing a point of spacetime as a two-by-two Hermitian matrix in the form
: formula_5
in terms of Pauli matrices.

This presentation, the Weyl presentation, satisfies
: formula_6

Therefore, one has identified the space of Hermitian matrices (which is four-dimensional, as a &quot;real&quot; vector space) with Minkowski spacetime, in such a way that the determinant of a Hermitian matrix is the squared length of the corresponding vector in Minkowski spacetime. An element acts on the space of Hermitian matrices via
: formula_7
where formula_8 is the Hermitian transpose of . This action preserves the determinant and so acts on Minkowski spacetime by (linear) isometries. The parity-inverted form of the above is
: formula_9
which transforms as
: formula_10
That this is the correct transformation follows by noting that
: formula_11
remains invariant under the above pair of transformations.

These maps are surjective, and kernel of either map is the two element subgroup . By the first isomorphism theorem, the quotient group is isomorphic to .

The parity map swaps these two coverings. It corresponds to Hermitian conjugation being an automorphism of . These two distinct coverings corresponds to the two distinct chiral actions of the Lorentz group on spinors. The non-overlined form corresponds to right-handed spinors transforming as , while the overline form corresponds to left-handed spinors transforming as .

It is important to observe that this pair of coverings does &quot;not&quot; survive quantization; when quantized, this leads to the peculiar phenomenon of the chiral anomaly. The classical (i.e., non-quantized) symmetries of the Lorentz group are broken by quantization; this is the content of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.

=== Notational conventions ===
In physics, it is conventional to denote a Lorentz transformation as , thus showing the matrix with spacetime indexes . A four-vector can be created from the Pauli matrices in two different ways: as formula_12 and as . The two forms are related by a parity transformation. Note that .

Given a Lorentz transformation , the double-covering of the orthochronous Lorentz group by given above can be written as 
: formula_13

Dropping the formula_14 this takes the form
: formula_15

The parity conjugate form is
: formula_16

==== Proof ====
That the above is the correct form for indexed notation is not immediately obvious, partly because, when working in indexed notation, it is quite easy to accidentally confuse a Lorentz transform with its inverse, or its transpose. This confusion arises due to the identity formula_17 being difficult to recognize when written in indexed form. Lorentz transforms are &quot;not&quot; tensors under Lorentz transformations! Thus a direct proof of this identity is useful, for establishing its correctness. It can be demonstrated by starting with the identity
: formula_18
where formula_19 so that the above are just the usual Pauli matrices, and formula_20 is the matrix transpose, and formula_21 is complex conjugation. The matrix formula_22 is
: formula_23

Written as the four-vector, the relationship is
: formula_24

This transforms as
: formula_25
Taking one more transpose, one gets
: formula_16

=== Symplectic group ===
The symplectic group is isomorphic to . This isomorphism is constructed so as to preserve a symplectic bilinear form on , that is, to leave the form invariant under Lorentz transformations. This may be articulated as follows. The symplectic group is defined as
: formula_27
where
: formula_23

Other common notations are formula_29 for this element; sometimes is used, but this invites confusion with the idea of almost complex structures, which are not the same, as they transform differently.

Given a pair of Weyl spinors (two-component spinors)
: formula_30
the invariant bilinear form is conventionally written as
: formula_31

This form is invariant under the Lorentz group, so that for one has
: formula_32

This defines a kind of &quot;scalar product&quot; of spinors, and is commonly used to defined a Lorentz-invariant mass term in Lagrangians. There are several notable properties to be called out that are important to physics. One is that formula_33 and so formula_34

The defining relation can be written as
: formula_35
which closely resembles the defining relation for the Lorentz group
: formula_36
where formula_37 is the metric tensor for Minkowski space and of course, formula_38 as before.

== Covering groups ==
Since is simply connected, it is the universal covering group of the restricted Lorentz group . By restriction, there is a homomorphism . Here, the special unitary group SU(2), which is isomorphic to the group of unit norm quaternions, is also simply connected, so it is the covering group of the rotation group . Each of these covering maps are twofold covers in the sense that precisely two elements of the covering group map to each element of the quotient. One often says that the restricted Lorentz group and the rotation group are doubly connected. This means that the fundamental group of the each group is isomorphic to the two-element cyclic group .

Twofold coverings are characteristic of spin groups. Indeed, in addition to the double coverings
: 
we have the double coverings
: 

These spinorial double coverings are constructed from Clifford algebras.

== Topology ==
The left and right groups in the double covering
are deformation retracts of the left and right groups, respectively, in the double covering
But the homogeneous space is homeomorphic to hyperbolic 3-space , so we have exhibited the restricted Lorentz group as a principal fiber bundle with fibers and base . Since the latter is homeomorphic to , while is homeomorphic to three-dimensional real projective space , we see that the restricted Lorentz group is &quot;locally&quot; homeomorphic to the product of with . Since the base space is contractible, this can be extended to a global homeomorphism.

== Conjugacy classes ==
Because the restricted Lorentz group is isomorphic to the Möbius group , its conjugacy classes also fall into five classes:
* Elliptic transformations
* Hyperbolic transformations
* Loxodromic transformations
* Parabolic transformations
* The trivial identity transformation

In the article on Möbius transformations, it is explained how this classification arises by considering the fixed points of Möbius transformations in their action on the Riemann sphere, which corresponds here to null eigenspaces of restricted Lorentz transformations in their action on Minkowski spacetime.

An example of each type is given in the subsections below, along with the effect of the one-parameter subgroup it generates (e.g., on the appearance of the night sky).

The Möbius transformations are the conformal transformations of the Riemann sphere (or celestial sphere). Then conjugating with an arbitrary element of obtains the following examples of arbitrary elliptic, hyperbolic, loxodromic, and parabolic (restricted) Lorentz transformations, respectively. The effect on the flow lines of the corresponding one-parameter subgroups is to transform the pattern seen in the examples by some conformal transformation. For example, an elliptic Lorentz transformation can have any two distinct fixed points on the celestial sphere, but points still flow along circular arcs from one fixed point toward the other. The other cases are similar.

=== Elliptic ===
An elliptic element of is
: formula_39
and has fixed points = 0, ∞. Writing the action as and collecting terms, the spinor map converts this to the (restricted) Lorentz transformation
: formula_40

This transformation then represents a rotation about the axis, exp(). The one-parameter subgroup it generates is obtained by taking to be a real variable, the rotation angle, instead of a constant.

The corresponding continuous transformations of the celestial sphere (except for the identity) all share the same two fixed points, the North and South poles. The transformations move all other points around latitude circles so that this group yields a continuous counter-clockwise rotation about the axis as increases. The &quot;angle doubling&quot; evident in the spinor map is a characteristic feature of &quot;spinorial double coverings&quot;.

=== Hyperbolic ===
A hyperbolic element of is
: formula_41
and has fixed points = 0, ∞. Under stereographic projection from the Riemann sphere to the Euclidean plane, the effect of this Möbius transformation is a dilation from the origin.

The spinor map converts this to the Lorentz transformation
: formula_42

This transformation represents a boost along the axis with rapidity . The one-parameter subgroup it generates is obtained by taking to be a real variable, instead of a constant. The corresponding continuous transformations of the celestial sphere (except for the identity) all share the same fixed points (the North and South poles), and they move all other points along longitudes away from the South pole and toward the North pole.

=== Loxodromic ===
A loxodromic element of is
: formula_43

and has fixed points = 0, ∞. The spinor map converts this to the Lorentz transformation
: formula_44

The one-parameter subgroup this generates is obtained by replacing with any real multiple of this complex constant. (If , vary independently, then a &quot;two-dimensional&quot; abelian subgroup is obtained, consisting of simultaneous rotations about the axis and boosts along the -axis; in contrast, the &quot;one-dimensional&quot; subgroup discussed here consists of those elements of this two-dimensional subgroup such that the rapidity of the boost and angle of the rotation have a &quot;fixed ratio&quot;.)

The corresponding continuous transformations of the celestial sphere (excepting the identity) all share the same two fixed points (the North and South poles). They move all other points away from the South pole and toward the North pole (or vice versa), along a family of curves called loxodromes. Each loxodrome spirals infinitely often around each pole.

=== Parabolic ===
A parabolic element of is
: formula_45

and has the single fixed point = ∞ on the Riemann sphere. Under stereographic projection, it appears as an ordinary translation along the real axis.

The spinor map converts this to the matrix (representing a Lorentz transformation)
: formula_46

This generates a two-parameter abelian subgroup, which is obtained by considering a complex variable rather than a constant. The corresponding continuous transformations of the celestial sphere (except for the identity transformation) move points along a family of circles that are all tangent at the North pole to a certain great circle. All points other than the North pole itself move along these circles.

Parabolic Lorentz transformations are often called null rotations. Since these are likely to be the least familiar of the four types of nonidentity Lorentz transformations (elliptic, hyperbolic, loxodromic, parabolic), it is illustrated here how to determine the effect of an example of a parabolic Lorentz transformation on Minkowski spacetime.

The matrix given above yields the transformation
: formula_47

Now, without loss of generality, pick . Differentiating this transformation with respect to the now real group parameter and evaluating at produces the corresponding vector field (first order linear partial differential operator),
: formula_48

Apply this to a function , and demand that it stays invariant; i.e., it is annihilated by this transformation. The solution of the resulting first order linear partial differential equation can be expressed in the form
: formula_49
where is an &quot;arbitrary&quot; smooth function. The arguments of give three &quot;rational invariants&quot; describing how points (events) move under this parabolic transformation, as they themselves do not move,
: formula_50

Choosing real values for the constants on the right hand sides yields three conditions, and thus specifies a curve in Minkowski spacetime. This curve is an orbit of the transformation.

The form of the rational invariants shows that these flowlines (orbits) have a simple description: suppressing the inessential coordinate , each orbit is the intersection of a &quot;null plane&quot;, , with a &quot;hyperboloid&quot;, . The case 3 = 0 has the hyperboloid degenerate to a light cone with the orbits becoming parabolas lying in corresponding null planes.

A particular null line lying on the light cone is left &quot;invariant&quot;; this corresponds to the unique (double) fixed point on the Riemann sphere mentioned above. The other null lines through the origin are &quot;swung around the cone&quot; by the transformation. Following the motion of one such null line as increases corresponds to following the motion of a point along one of the circular flow lines on the celestial sphere, as described above.

A choice instead, produces similar orbits, now with the roles of and interchanged.

Parabolic transformations lead to the gauge symmetry of massless particles (such as photons) with helicity || ≥ 1. In the above explicit example, a massless particle moving in the direction, so with 4-momentum , is not affected at all by the -boost and -rotation combination defined below, in the &quot;little group&quot; of its motion. This is evident from the explicit transformation law discussed: like any light-like vector, P itself is now invariant; i.e., all traces or effects of have disappeared. , in the special case discussed. (The other similar generator, as well as it and comprise altogether the little group of the light-like vector, isomorphic to .)

=== Appearance of the night sky ===
This isomorphism has the consequence that Möbius transformations of the Riemann sphere represent the way that Lorentz transformations change the appearance of the night sky, as seen by an observer who is maneuvering at relativistic velocities relative to the &quot;fixed stars&quot;.

Suppose the &quot;fixed stars&quot; live in Minkowski spacetime and are modeled by points on the celestial sphere. Then a given point on the celestial sphere can be associated with , a complex number that corresponds to the point on the Riemann sphere, and can be identified with a null vector (a light-like vector) in Minkowski space
: formula_51
or, in the Weyl representation (the spinor map), the Hermitian matrix
: formula_52

The set of real scalar multiples of this null vector, called a &quot;null line&quot; through the origin, represents a &quot;line of sight&quot; from an observer at a particular place and time (an arbitrary event we can identify with the origin of Minkowski spacetime) to various distant objects, such as stars. Then the points of the celestial sphere (equivalently, lines of sight) are identified with certain Hermitian matrices.

==== Projective geometry and different views of the 2-sphere ====
This picture emerges cleanly in the language of projective geometry. The (restricted) Lorentz group acts on the projective celestial sphere. This is the space of non-zero null vectors with formula_53 under the given quotient for projective spaces: formula_54 if formula_55 for formula_56. This is referred to as the celestial sphere as this allows us to rescale the time coordinate formula_57 to 1 after acting using a Lorentz transformation, ensuring the space-like part sits on the unit sphere.

From the Möbius side, acts on complex projective space , which can be shown to be diffeomorphic to the 2-sphere – this is sometimes referred to as the Riemann sphere. The quotient on projective space leads to a quotient on the group .

Finally, these two can be linked together by using the complex projective vector to construct a null-vector. If formula_58 is a projective vector, it can be tensored with its Hermitian conjugate to produce a formula_59 Hermitian matrix. From elsewhere in this article we know this space of matrices can be viewed as 4-vectors. The space of matrices coming from turning each projective vector in the Riemann sphere into a matrix is known as the Bloch sphere.

== Lie algebra ==

As with any Lie group, a useful way to study many aspects of the Lorentz group is via its Lie algebra. Since the Lorentz group is a matrix Lie group, its corresponding Lie algebra formula_60 is a matrix Lie algebra, which may be computed as
: formula_61.

If formula_62 is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries , then the Lie algebra formula_63 consists of formula_64 matrices formula_65 such that
: formula_66.

Explicitly, formula_67 consists of formula_64 matrices of the form
: formula_69,
where formula_70 are arbitrary real numbers. This Lie algebra is six dimensional. The subalgebra of formula_67 consisting of elements in which formula_72, formula_73, and formula_74 equal to zero is isomorphic to formula_75.

The full Lorentz group , the proper Lorentz group and the proper orthochronous Lorentz group (the component connected to the identity) all have the same Lie algebra, which is typically denoted .

Since the identity component of the Lorentz group is isomorphic to a finite quotient of (see the section above on the connection of the Lorentz group to the Möbius group), the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group is isomorphic to the Lie algebra . As a complex Lie algebra formula_76 is three dimensional, but is six dimensional when viewed as a real Lie algebra.

=== Commutation relations of the Lorentz algebra ===
The standard basis matrices can be indexed as formula_77 where formula_78 take values in . These arise from taking only one of formula_79 to be one, and others zero, in turn. The components can be written as
: formula_80.
The commutation relations are
: formula_81
There are different possible choices of convention in use. In physics, it is common to include a factor of formula_82 with the basis elements, which gives a factor of formula_82 in the commutation relations.

Then formula_84 generate boosts and formula_85 generate rotations.

The structure constants for the Lorentz algebra can be read off from the commutation relations. Any set of basis elements which satisfy these relations form a representation of the Lorentz algebra.

=== Generators of boosts and rotations ===
The Lorentz group can be thought of as a subgroup of the diffeomorphism group of and therefore its Lie algebra can be identified with vector fields on . In particular, the vectors that generate isometries on a space are its Killing vectors, which provides a convenient alternative to the left-invariant vector field for calculating the Lie algebra. We can write down a set of six generators:
* Vector fields on generating three rotations ,
*: formula_86
* Vector fields on generating three boosts ,
*: formula_87

The factor of appears to ensure that the generators of rotations are Hermitian.

It may be helpful to briefly recall here how to obtain a one-parameter group from a vector field, written in the form of a first order linear partial differential operator such as
: formula_88

The corresponding initial value problem (consider formula_89 a function of a scalar formula_90 and solve formula_91 with some initial conditions) is
: formula_92

The solution can be written
: formula_93
or
: formula_94
where we easily recognize the one-parameter matrix group of rotations about the z-axis.

Differentiating with respect to the group parameter and setting it in that result, we recover the standard matrix,
: formula_95
which corresponds to the vector field we started with. This illustrates how to pass between matrix and vector field representations of elements of the Lie algebra. The exponential map plays this special role not only for the Lorentz group but for Lie groups in general.

Reversing the procedure in the previous section, we see that the Möbius transformations that correspond to our six generators arise from exponentiating respectively (for the three boosts) or (for the three rotations) times the three Pauli matrices
: formula_96

=== Generators of the Möbius group ===
Another generating set arises via the isomorphism to the Möbius group. The following table lists the six generators, in which
* The first column gives a generator of the flow under the Möbius action (after stereographic projection from the Riemann sphere) as a &quot;real&quot; vector field on the Euclidean plane.
* The second column gives the corresponding one-parameter subgroup of Möbius transformations.
* The third column gives the corresponding one-parameter subgroup of Lorentz transformations (the image under our homomorphism of preceding one-parameter subgroup).
* The fourth column gives the corresponding generator of the flow under the Lorentz action as a real vector field on Minkowski spacetime.

Notice that the generators consist of
* Two parabolics (null rotations)
* One hyperbolic (boost in the formula_97 direction)
* Three elliptics (rotations about the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; axes, respectively)

==== Worked example: rotation about the y-axis ====
Start with
: formula_98

Exponentiate:
: formula_99

This element of represents the one-parameter subgroup of (elliptic) Möbius transformations:
: formula_100

Next,
: formula_101

The corresponding vector field on (thought of as the image of under stereographic projection) is
: formula_102

Writing formula_103, this becomes the vector field on 
: formula_104

Returning to our element of , writing out the action formula_105 and collecting terms, we find that the image under the spinor map is the element of 
: formula_106

Differentiating with respect to at , yields the corresponding vector field on , 
: formula_107

This is evidently the generator of counterclockwise rotation about the -axis.

== Subgroups of the Lorentz group ==
The subalgebras of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group can be enumerated, up to conjugacy, from which the closed subgroups of the restricted Lorentz group can be listed, up to conjugacy. (See the book by Hall cited below for the details.) These can be readily expressed in terms of the generators formula_108 given in the table above.

The one-dimensional subalgebras of course correspond to the four conjugacy classes of elements of the Lorentz group:
* formula_109 generates a one-parameter subalgebra of parabolics ,
* formula_110 generates a one-parameter subalgebra of boosts ,
* formula_111 generates a one-parameter of rotations ,
* formula_112 (for any formula_113) generates a one-parameter subalgebra of loxodromic transformations.
(Strictly speaking the last corresponds to infinitely many classes, since distinct formula_72 give different classes.)
The two-dimensional subalgebras are:
* formula_115 generate an abelian subalgebra consisting entirely of parabolics,
* formula_116 generate a nonabelian subalgebra isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the affine group ,
* formula_117 generate an abelian subalgebra consisting of boosts, rotations, and loxodromics all sharing the same pair of fixed points.
The three-dimensional subalgebras use the Bianchi classification scheme:
* formula_118 generate a Bianchi V subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of , the group of &quot;euclidean homotheties&quot;,
* formula_119 generate a Bianchi VII subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of , the euclidean group,
* formula_120, where formula_113, generate a Bianchi VII subalgebra,
* formula_122 generate a Bianchi VIII subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of , the group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane,
* formula_123 generate a Bianchi IX subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of , the rotation group.

The Bianchi types refer to the classification of three-dimensional Lie algebras by the Italian mathematician Luigi Bianchi.

The four-dimensional subalgebras are all conjugate to
* formula_124 generate a subalgebra isomorphic to the Lie algebra of , the group of Euclidean similitudes.

The subalgebras form a lattice (see the figure), and each subalgebra generates by exponentiation a closed subgroup of the restricted Lie group. From these, all subgroups of the Lorentz group can be constructed, up to conjugation, by multiplying by one of the elements of the Klein four-group.
As with any connected Lie group, the coset spaces of the closed subgroups of the restricted Lorentz group, or homogeneous spaces, have considerable mathematical interest. A few, brief descriptions:
* The group is the stabilizer of a &quot;null line&quot;; i.e., of a point on the Riemann sphere—so the homogeneous space is the Kleinian geometry that represents conformal geometry on the sphere .
* The (identity component of the) Euclidean group is the stabilizer of a null vector, so the homogeneous space is the momentum space of a massless particle; geometrically, this Kleinian geometry represents the &quot;degenerate&quot; geometry of the light cone in Minkowski spacetime.
* The rotation group is the stabilizer of a timelike vector, so the homogeneous space is the momentum space of a massive particle; geometrically, this space is none other than three-dimensional hyperbolic space .

== Generalization to higher dimensions ==
The concept of the Lorentz group has a natural generalization to spacetime of any number of dimensions. Mathematically, the Lorentz group of (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space is the indefinite orthogonal group of linear transformations of that preserves the quadratic form
: formula_125

The group preserves the quadratic form
: formula_126

 is isomorphic to , and both presentations of the Lorentz group are in use in the theoretical physics community. The former is more common in literature related to gravity, while the latter is more common in particle physics literature.

A common notation for the vector space , equipped with this choice of quadratic form, is .

Many of the properties of the Lorentz group in four dimensions (where ) generalize straightforwardly to arbitrary . For instance, the Lorentz group has four connected components, and it acts by conformal transformations on the celestial -sphere in -dimensional Minkowski space. The identity component is an -bundle over hyperbolic -space .

The low-dimensional cases and are often useful as &quot;toy models&quot; for the physical case , while higher-dimensional Lorentz groups are used in physical theories such as string theory that posit the existence of hidden dimensions. The Lorentz group is also the isometry group of -dimensional de Sitter space , which may be realized as the homogeneous space . In particular is the isometry group of the de Sitter universe , a cosmological model.

<doc id="230491" wikidata="Q899044" url="?curid=230491" title="Fock space">
<text>The Fock space is an algebraic construction used in quantum mechanics to construct the quantum states space of a variable or unknown number of identical particles from a single particle Hilbert space . It is named after V. A. Fock who first introduced it in his 1932 paper &quot;Konfigurationsraum und zweite Quantelung&quot; (&quot;Configuration space and second quantization&quot;).

Informally, a Fock space is the sum of a set of Hilbert spaces representing zero particle states, one particle states, two particle states, and so on. If the identical particles are bosons, the -particle states are vectors in a symmetrized tensor product of single-particle Hilbert spaces . If the identical particles are fermions, the -particle states are vectors in an antisymmetrized tensor product of single-particle Hilbert spaces (see symmetric algebra and exterior algebra respectively). A general state in Fock space is a linear combination of -particle states, one for each .

Technically, the Fock space is (the Hilbert space completion of) the direct sum of the symmetric or antisymmetric tensors in the tensor powers of a single-particle Hilbert space ,
formula_1

Here formula_2 is the operator that symmetrizes or antisymmetrizes a tensor, depending on whether the Hilbert space describes particles obeying bosonic formula_3 or fermionic formula_4 statistics, and the overline represents the completion of the space. The bosonic (resp. fermionic) Fock space can alternatively be constructed as (the Hilbert space completion of) the symmetric tensors formula_5 (resp. alternating tensors formula_6). For every basis for there is a natural basis of the Fock space, the Fock states.

== Definition ==

The Fock space is the (Hilbert) direct sum of tensor products of copies of a single-particle Hilbert space formula_7

formula_8

Here formula_9, the complex scalars, consists of the states corresponding to no particles, formula_7 the states of one particle, formula_11 the states of two identical particles etc.

A general state in formula_12 is given by

formula_13
where
*formula_14 is a vector of length 1 called the vacuum state and formula_15 is a complex coefficient,
*formula_16 is a state in the single particle Hilbert space and formula_17 is a complex coefficient,
*formula_18, and formula_19 is a complex coefficient, etc.

The convergence of this infinite sum is important if formula_12 is to be a Hilbert space. Technically we require formula_12 to be the Hilbert space completion of the algebraic direct sum. It consists of all infinite tuples formula_22 such that the norm, defined by the inner product is finite
formula_23
where the formula_24 particle norm is defined by
formula_25
i.e., the restriction of the norm on the tensor product formula_26

For two general states
formula_27 and
formula_28
the inner product on formula_12 is then defined as
formula_30
where we use the inner products on each of the formula_24-particle Hilbert spaces. Note that, in particular the formula_24 particle subspaces are orthogonal for different formula_24.

== Product states, indistinguishable particles, and a useful basis for Fock space ==
A product state of the Fock space is a state of the form

formula_34

which describes a collection of formula_24 particles, one of which has quantum state formula_36, another formula_37 and so on up to the formula_24th particle, where each formula_39 is &quot;any&quot; state from the single particle Hilbert space formula_7. Here juxtaposition (writing the single particle kets side by side, without the formula_41) is symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) multiplication in the symmetric (antisymmetric) tensor algebra. The general state in a Fock space is a linear combination of product states. A state that cannot be written as a convex sum of product states is called an entangled state.

When we speak of &quot;one particle in state formula_39&quot;, we must bear in mind that in quantum mechanics identical particles are indistinguishable. In the same Fock space, all particles are identical. (To describe many species of particles, we take the tensor product of as many different Fock spaces as there are species of particles under consideration). It is one of the most powerful features of this formalism that states are implicitly properly symmetrized. For instance, if the above state formula_43 is fermionic, it will be 0 if two (or more) of the formula_39 are equal because the antisymmetric (exterior) product formula_45. This is a mathematical formulation of the Pauli exclusion principle that no two (or more) fermions can be in the same quantum state. In fact, whenever the terms in a formal product are linearly dependent; the product will be zero for antisymmetric tensors. Also, the product of orthonormal states is properly orthonormal by construction (although possibly 0 in the Fermi case when two states are equal).

A useful and convenient basis for a Fock space is the &quot;occupancy number basis&quot;. Given a basis formula_46 of formula_7, we can denote the state with
formula_48 particles in state formula_49,
formula_50 particles in state formula_51, ..., formula_52 particles in state formula_53, and no particles in the remaining states, by defining

formula_54

where each formula_55 takes the value 0 or 1 for fermionic particles and 0, 1, 2, ... for bosonic particles. Note that trailing zeroes may be dropped without changing the state. Such a state is called a Fock state. When the formula_56 are understood as the steady states of a free field, the Fock states describe an assembly of non-interacting particles in definite numbers. The most general Fock state is a linear superposition of pure states.

Two operators of great importance are the creation and annihilation operators, which upon acting on a Fock state add or respectively remove a particle in the ascribed quantum state. They are denoted formula_57 for creation and formula_58for annihilation respectively. To create (&quot;add&quot;) a particle, the quantum state formula_59 is symmetric or exterior- multiplied with formula_59; and respectively to annihilate (&quot;remove&quot;) a particle, an (even or odd) interior product is taken with formula_61, which is the adjoint of formula_62. It is often convenient to work with states of the basis of formula_7 so that these operators remove and add exactly one particle in the given basis state. These operators also serve as generators for more general operators acting on the Fock space, for instance the number operator giving the number of particles in a specific state formula_64 is formula_65.

== Wave function interpretation ==

Often the one particle space formula_7 is given as formula_67, the space of square-integrable functions on a space formula_68 with measure formula_69 (strictly speaking, the equivalence classes of square integrable functions where functions are equivalent if they differ on a set of measure zero). The typical example is the free particle with formula_70 the space of square integrable functions on three-dimensional space. The Fock spaces then have a natural interpretation as symmetric or anti-symmetric square integrable functions as follows.

Let formula_71 and formula_72, formula_73, formula_74, etc.
Consider the space of tuples of points which is the disjoint union

formula_75

It has a natural measure formula_76 such that formula_77 and the restriction of formula_76 to formula_79 is formula_80.
The even Fock space formula_81 can then be identified with the space of symmetric functions in formula_82 whereas the odd Fock space formula_83 can be identified with the space of anti-symmetric functions. The identification follows directly from the isometric mapping
formula_84
formula_85.

Given wave functions formula_86, the Slater determinant

formula_87
is an antisymmetric function on formula_79. It can thus be naturally interpreted as an element of the formula_24-particle sector of the odd Fock space. The normalization is chosen such that formula_90 if the functions formula_91 are orthonormal. There is a similar &quot;Slater permanent&quot; with the determinant replaced with the permanent which gives elements of formula_24-sector of the even Fock space.

== Relation to the Segal–Bargmann space ==

Define the Segal–Bargmann space formula_93 of complex holomorphic functions square-integrable with respect to a Gaussian measure:

formula_94
where
formula_95
Then defining a space formula_96 as the nested union of the spaces formula_93 over the integers formula_98, Segal and Bargmann showed that formula_96 is isomorphic to a bosonic Fock space. The monomial
formula_100
corresponds to the Fock state
formula_101

<doc id="230497" wikidata="Q5477" url="?curid=230497" title="Caucasus Mountains">
<text>The Caucasus Mountains is a mountain range at the intersection of Asia and Europe. Stretching between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, they are surrounded by the Caucasus region and are home to Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in Europe at above sea level.

The Caucasus Mountains include the Greater Caucasus in the north and the Lesser Caucasus in the south. The Greater Caucasus runs west-northwest to east-southeast, from the Western Caucasus on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea to close to Baku on the Caspian Sea, in Azerbaijan. The Lesser Caucasus runs parallel to the Greater about south. The Greater and Lesser Caucasus ranges are connected by the Likhi Range, and to the west and east of the Likhi Range lie the Colchis Plain and the Kur-Araz Lowland respectively. The Meskheti Range is a part of the Lesser Caucasus system. In the southeast, the Aras River separates the Lesser Caucasus from the Talysh Mountains which runs through the Greater Azerbaijan region. The Lesser Caucasus and the Armenian Highland constitute the Transcaucasian Highland, which at their western end converges with the highland plateau of Eastern Anatolia. The Caucasus Mountains were part of the Silk Road.

==Geology==
Geologically, the Caucasus Mountains belong to the Alpide belt system that extends from southeastern Europe into Asia and is considered a border between the two continents. The Greater Caucasus Mountains are mainly composed of Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks with the Paleozoic and Precambrian rocks in the higher regions. Some volcanic formations are found throughout the range. On the other hand, the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are formed predominantly of the Paleogene rocks with a much smaller portion of Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. The evolution of the Caucasus began from the Late Triassic to the Late Jurassic during the Cimmerian orogeny at the active margin of the Tethys Ocean while the uplift of the Greater Caucasus is dated to the Miocene during the Alpine orogeny.

The Caucasus Mountains formed largely as the result of a tectonic plate collision between the Arabian plate moving northwards with respect to the Eurasian plate. As the Tethys Sea was closed and the Arabian plate collided with the Iranian plate and was pushed against it, and with the clockwise movement of the Eurasian plate towards the Iranian plate and their final collision, the Iranian plate was pressed against the Eurasian plate. As this happened, the rocks that had been deposited in this basin from the Jurassic to the Miocene were folded to form the Greater Caucasus Mountains. This collision also caused the uplift and the Cenozoic volcanic activity in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains.

The entire region is regularly subjected to strong earthquakes from this activity. While the Greater Caucasus Mountains have a mainly folded sedimentary structure, the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are largely of volcanic origin.

The Javakheti Volcanic Plateau in Georgia and the surrounding volcanic ranges which extend well into central Armenia are some of the youngest features of the region. Only recently was the Caucasus a scene for intense volcanic activity: the Armenian highland was flooded by calc-alkaline basalts and andesites in the Pliocene and the highest summits of the Caucasus, the Elbrus, and the Kazbek, formed as Pleistocene-Pliocene volcanoes. The Kazbek is no longer active, but the Elbrus erupted in postglacial times and fumarole activity is registered near its summit. Contemporary seismic activity is a prominent feature of the region, reflecting active faulting and crustal shortening. Clusters of seismicity occur in Dagestan and in northern Armenia. Many devastating earthquakes have been documented in historical times, including the Spitak earthquake in December 1988 which destroyed the Gyumri-Vanadzor region of Armenia.

==Notable peaks==
Mount Elbrus, at , in the Caucasus Mountains, is sometimes cited as the highest peak in Europe. Mount Elbrus is higher than Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps and Western Europe at . However, there are some technical disagreements over whether Mount Elbrus is in Europe. The crest of the Greater Caucasus Mountains is usually taken to define the Greater Caucasus Watershed which marks the continental boundary between Asia and Europe for the region between the Black and Caspian seas. This classification would place Mount Elbrus at the junction with Asia.

The table below lists some of the highest peaks of the Caucasus. With the exception of Shkhara, the heights are taken from Soviet 1:50,000 mapping. The list includes the ten ultras (mountains of more than 1,500 m prominence) and all mountains over 4,500 m height with 300 m prominence. Mount Ağrı (5,137 m) in Turkey is just south of the Lesser Caucasus.

==Climate==

The climate of the Caucasus varies both vertically (according to elevation) and horizontally (by latitude and location). Temperature generally decreases as elevation rises. Average annual temperature in Sokhumi, Abkhazia at sea level is while on the slopes of Mt.Kazbek at an elevation of , average annual temperature falls to . The northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range are 3 °C (5.4 °F) colder than the southern slopes. The highlands of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia are marked by sharp temperature contrasts between the summer and winter months due to a more continental climate.

Precipitation increases from east to west in most areas. Elevation plays an important role in the Caucasus and mountains generally receive higher amounts of precipitation than low-lying areas. The north-eastern regions (Dagestan) and the southern portions of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are the driest. The absolute minimum annual precipitation is in the northeastern Caspian Depression. Western parts of the Caucasus Mountains are marked by high amounts of precipitation. The southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range receive higher amounts of precipitation than the northern slopes. Annual precipitation in the Western Caucasus ranges from while in the Eastern and Northern Caucasus (Chechnya, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Ossetia, Kakheti, Kartli, etc.) precipitation ranges from . The absolute maximum annual precipitation is around the Mt. Mtirala area which lies on the Meskheti Range in Adjara. The precipitation of the Lesser Caucasus Mountain Range (Southern Georgia, Armenia, western Azerbaijan), not including the Meskheti Range, varies from 300- annually.

The Caucasus Mountains are known for the high amount of snowfall, although many regions which are not located along the windward slopes do not receive nearly as much snow. This is especially true for the Lesser Caucasus Mountains which are somewhat isolated from the moist influences coming in from the Black Sea and receive considerably less precipitation (in the form of snow) than the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The average winter snow cover of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains ranges from . The Greater Caucasus Mountains (especially the southwestern slopes) are marked by heavy snowfall. Avalanches are common from November to April.

Snow cover in several regions (Svaneti and northern Abkhazia) may reach . The Mt. Achishkho region, which is the snowiest place in the Caucasus, often records snow depths of .

==Landscape==

The Caucasus Mountains have a varied landscape which changes according to elevation and distance from large bodies of water. The region contains biomes ranging from subtropical lowland marshes and forests to glaciers (Western and Central Caucasus), and highland semideserts, steppes, and alpine meadows in the south (mainly in Armenia and Azerbaijan).

The northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains are covered by oak, hornbeam, maple, and ash forests at lower elevations while birch and pine forests take over at higher elevations. Some of the lowest areas of the region are covered by steppes and grasslands. The slopes of the North-western Greater Caucasus (Kabardino-Balkaria, Cherkessia, etc.) also contain spruce and fir forests. The alpine zone replaces the forest at around above sea level. The permafrost/glacier line generally starts around . The southeastern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains are covered by beech, oak, maple, hornbeam, and ash forests. Beech forests tend to dominate in higher locations. The south-western slopes of the Greater Caucasus are covered by Colchian forests (oak, buxus, beech, chestnut, hornbeam, elm) at lower elevations with coniferous and mixed forests (spruce, fir and beech) taking over at higher elevations. The alpine zone on the southern slopes may extend up to above sea level while the glacier/snow line starts at .

The northern and western slopes of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are characterized both by Colchian and other deciduous forests at lower elevations while mixed and coniferous forests (mainly spruce and fir) dominate at higher elevations. Beech forests are also common at higher elevations. The southern slopes of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are largely covered by grasslands and steppes up to an elevation of . The highest areas of the region too contains alpine grasslands. Volcanic and other rock formations are common throughout the region. The volcanic zone extends over a large area from southern Georgia into Armenia and southwestern Azerbaijan. Some of the prominent peaks of the region include Mt. Aragats, Didi Abuli, Samsari, and others. The area is characterized by volcanic plateaus, lava flows, volcanic lakes, volcanic cones and other features. The Lesser Caucasus Mountains lack the type of glaciers and glacial features that are common on the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range.

==History==

Crossing the Caucasus Mountain range was an important section of the northern arm of the Silk Route. Tusheti shepherds of Georgia have been herding livestock to seasonal grazing grounds, a practice known as transhumance for over 10,000 years. There was one pass on the southeast end in Derbent (known as the Caspian Gates or Gates of Alexander), and multiple passes throughout the range: Jvari Pass at 2379 m and above the Darial Gorge on the Georgian Military Road, Mamison Pass on the Ossetian Military Road at 2911 m, and Roki Tunnel at 2310 m.

<text>Number 96 is an Australian primetime soap opera that aired on 0-10 Network (the forerunner of what is now Network Ten) from 13 March 1972 to 11 August 1977, originally broadcast in the primetime slot of 8:30 pm for 5 x half-hour episodes every weeknight, then later 2 x one hour episodes screened per week.

Originally it aired in black and white monochrome until halfway through its run. From March 1975, it was seen in colour as networks switched over to colour television broadcasting in Australia

==Background==
The series was notable for breaking new ground and introducing controversial subject matter. The premiere of the series was promoted heavily in media with newspaper advertisements that described it as &quot;Tonight, Australian television loses its virginity&quot; and it followed the lives of residents living in a four-storey city apartment block at the fictional 96 Lindsay Street, Paddington.

The show was conceived by British novelist David Sale (who also was a screenwriter who worked on the series) and developed by production firm Cash Harmon Productions The series was originally commissioned by the then flagging 0-10 network to make a soap opera with similar elements to the British series &quot;&quot;Coronation Street&quot;, but a little racier&quot;.

The show was a daring last-bid attempt from a network struggling on the verge of bankruptcy, and its immediate success (and advertising revenue) helped it become more competitive by buying successful new international shows such as &quot;The Waltons&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. By 1974, the network was number one in the ratings for the first time in its history.

&quot;Number 96&quot; became one of the most popular Australian drama television series of all time, but due to its racy subject matter, it was unable to be picked up by many international markets. It was the first soap opera to screen in prime time five nights a week, and later became the first Australian TV series to inspire a US remake.

&quot;Number 96&quot; became infamous for its groundbreaking depictions of taboo subjects of the time, exploring issues such as homosexuality, abortion, rape, interracial romance, drug usage, pregnancy in later life, and transgenderism, but also its array of comedy characters with their own catchphrases, in a nod to vaudeville.

The highest rating episode was when it was revealed that Lucy Sutcliffe&#x27;s (portrayed by Elisabeth Kirkby) lump in her breast was benign, after which many women went to their doctors to be tested for cancer, an issue that was not discussed much at the time and long before singer Kylie Minogue went public with her diagnosis.

==Multicultural milestones==
Based during an era of mass (white) emigration to Australia, mostly from the UK, &quot;Number 96&quot;, as befitting its inner-city location, presented a much more multicultural view of suburbia. 

Its longer-term British characters included originals Lucy Sutcliffe (Elisabeth Kirkby) and her husband Alf (James Elliot), who hailed from Lancashire, series writer David Sale stated he based the characters on his own parents from England, and even naming Lucy after his own mum, but whereas his own parents who had emigrated to Australia and loved the country, he depicted Alf as the archetypal whinging pom who longed to go back to his native England

In later years and having previously played Les Whittaker, Gordon McDougall returned to the series playing the role of Scottish aristocrat brother Lord McCraddenow, whilst Don Finlayson&#x27;s Aunt Amanda von Pappanburg was a British Baroness who lived in Germany and visited Don on several occasions.

Other European characters included Aldo Godolfus from Hungary, the Russian Roma Lubinski-Godulfus and the Italian deli worker Giovanni Lenzi and his aunt Maria Panucci. Fashion designer Vera Collins came from South Africa. Shorter-term characters included Indian Dr Bannerjee, African-Americans Chad Farrell and Hope Jackson, and indigenous Australian Rhonda Jackson.

==LGBTQ milestones and TV world firsts==
&quot;Number 96&quot; was the first television program anywhere in the world to feature a full diverse range of LGBTQ characters as regulars, although many historians and scholars are unaware of this, because the show&#x27;s controversial content meant it was unable to be screened outside of Australia. 

There had been LGBTQ characters in programs before but these were primarily guest characters or fleeting mentions.

Actor Joe Hasham appeared for the duration of the series, as Lawyer Don Finlayson. Hence, Number 96 was the first series to depict a gay character in a regular role and the first to be portrayed as a sympathetic character and in a positive light. Hasham&#x27;s Finlayson gained a cult following and been acknowledged as doing much for gay-lib. Don was depicted as being dependable, sincere and kind, yet he was not effeminate and came across as straight acting, though he had no hang-ups about being gay. Don would have several gay relationships in the series (and a few one-night stands), but maintained he was homosexual and never had relationships with woman.

Don&#x27;s first lover in early episodes would be bisexual photographer Bruce Taylor (Portrayed by Paul Weingott), Taylor would be TV&#x27;s first bisexual character, whilst with Don he would have an affair with ruthless businesswoman Maggie Cameron, after Bruce fled, Don would form a more long-term and enduring relationship with hilariously camp bisexual chef Dudley &quot;Dud&quot; Butterfield. Don and Dudley would remain live together for 2 years and only separate when Dudley decided to become a ladies man, in sequences made primarily for comedic effect.

Prior to Number 96 TV&#x27;s first gay character had been seen the previous year in the US sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot; but he was a one-off. In the storyline a friend of Archie Bunker&#x27;s, (portrayed by Carroll O&#x27;Connor) known only as &quot;Steve&quot; played by Phillip Carey in a guest part came out as gay telling Bunker of his sexuality in an early episode titled &quot;Judging Books By Covers&quot;. after which however the character was never seen or mentioned again.

According to the publication &quot;The Great Clowns of American Television&quot;, comedian Ernie Kovacs was the first person to portray a gay character Percy Dovetonsils in his self-titled &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;, although the term was not officially established at that time.

The first regular gay character in the US occurred several months after Number 96 in 1972. Actor Vincent Schiavelli played Peter Panama in sitcom &quot;The Corner Bar&quot;, but he was short-lived and however unlike Number 96&#x27;s Joe Hasham he&#x27;s portrayal did not prove popular with viewers and he only appeared for the first season, with then-president of the New York-based Gay Activists Alliance calling it &quot;the worst stereotype of a gay person I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

Number 96 would also feature numerous firsts, however usually featuring shorter term cast in varying story-arcs, for example notable theatre star Toni Lamond, played Karen Winters, who was TV&#x27;s first ever lesbian character. She was shown fondling and kissing the virginal Bev (played by series regular Abigail) whilst she was sleeping under the effect of sleeping pills. Karen was later revealed to be a devil worshipper who wanted to sacrifice Bev to the devil during a Black Mass, a story-arc that was heavily censored.

A second lesbian character, Marie Crowther (played by Hazel Phillips), left the series after ogling Vera Collins in the shower and being told her affections would not be returned.

The series also featured TV&#x27;s first ever transgender character, and remarkably she was played by a transgender actress, cabaret performer Carlotta. Robyn Ross was romanced by Arnold Feather (Jeff Kevin), a comic character whose early romances always ended in disaster. Although the relationship did not last, she was never dehumanised or poked fun at.

==Broadcasting and production==
Bill Harmon and Don Cash had previously worked in New York at NBC, and became a partnership after arriving in Australia and producing adventure series &quot;The Rovers&quot; and a couple of unsuccessful films.

Production of &quot;Number 96&quot; started in October 1971. It was produced and recorded on videotape in monochrome for the first three years, and switched to colour production in late 1974. Many of the early black-and-white episodes no longer exist, due primarily to network policy of the time of destroying or wiping tape. 

Producer Don Cash, used one of the world&#x27;s first computers to figure out how the series could construct such a large output. The standard invented by him was later used on all Australian soaps created thereafter. 

The premise, original story outlines, and original characters were devised by series creator David Sale, who had also written for the TV comedy satire series &quot;The Mavis Bramston Show&quot;. Sale also wrote the scripts for the first episodes of &quot;Number 96&quot; and continued as a script writer and storyliner for much of the show&#x27;s run. 

A building at 83 Moncur Street, Woollahra, was used for exterior establishing shots of the block of flats. The majority of the recording was done on sets at the studios of Channel Ten based then in North Ryde, Sydney. 

Directors included Peter Benardos and Brian Phillis. Regular writers included David Sale, Johnny Whyte, who was the series final script editor, Susan Swinford, Dick Barry, Michael Laurence, Lynn Foster, Ken Shadie, and Eleanor Witcombe. 

==Controversial stories==
&quot;Number 96&quot; became infamous for its groundbreaking adult storylines and nudity, its comedy characters, and controversial storylines including teenage drug addiction and a black mass conducted by devil-worshippers. Whodunits included a panty snatcher (dubbed the Knicker Snipper), the Pantyhose Strangler, the Hooded Rapist, and a bomb that exploded killing off four characters.

A story where Rose Godolfus (Vivienne Garrett) took marijuana was the first time the Australian Broadcasting Control Board exercised the 101 censorship code, insisting that Rose must be shown to suffer from its effects. However, a few years later, at the request of NSW Police, a heroin drug storyline was explored with 15-year-old schoolgirl Debbie Chester (Dina Mann). She was seen being taught how to inject heroin with a needle, in a storyline designed to warn parents how easy it was.

The first shock moment involved heavily pregnant Helen Eastwood (Briony Behets) finding her husband Mark (Martin Harris) in their bed with Rose Godolfus (in what was TV&#x27;s first topless nude scene until censors ordered it to be cut). Helen ran out, fell down the stairs and miscarried, while Rose was later gang-raped by bikies. Later, doctor Gordon Vansard (Joe James) was struck off the books for providing drugs for an illegal abortion, while his wife Sonia (Lynn Rainbow) suffered from mental delusions, leaving but then returning for the film version of &quot;Number 96&quot;.
An early interracial kiss occurred between character Chad Farrell, played by Ronne Arnold, and Sonia (Lynn Rainbow), was said to have made the show unable to be sold to the U.S. International networks could cut out the nudity, but the interracial romances and homosexual themes were too frequent to be censored. 

A later interracial romance saw Indigenous actress Justine Saunders playing hairdresser Rhonda Jackson. She had an affair with Dudley (Chard Hayward) but was secretly in love with Arnold (Jeff Kevin) and the actress became the first Aboriginal woman to appear on the cover of &quot;TV Week&quot; while publicising this role.

The final year of &quot;Number 96&quot; featured the reintroduction of sexual situations with more extreme nudity, and increasingly violent situations. Carol Raye, who played Amanda and stayed on behind the scenes to do casting, had left and creator David Sale also quit in its final months, concerned about the show&#x27;s change in direction. Without them, the show spun wildly out of control. 

Don and Dudley had split; Don&#x27;s new boyfriend was schizophrenic Rob Forsyth (John McTernan) and then corrupt cult leader Joshua (Shane Porteous). The show&#x27;s final months saw Dudley being graphically machine-gunned to death in the Wine Bar (now a disco called Duddles), and a neo-Nazi bikie gang ran amok in a violent storyline that upset some real-life bikers. 

As ratings fell, the boldest move in the show&#x27;s final months was showing full frontal nudity with the arrival of Miss Hemingway, a delusional psychiatric patient who didn&#x27;t like wearing clothes. The move, however, attracted just three complaints, despite being screened on free to air TV at 8.30 pm. 

Other bedroom farce sequences featured male and female nudity. A scene where Jane Chester becomes a prostitute and is asked to whip her male client, new &quot;Number 96&quot; resident Toby Buxton (Malcolm Thompson), featured a brief glimpse of his full frontal male nudity. 

Another world first in its dying months was the first use of a four letter word in a TV drama, when Grant Chandler asked if anyone found the word &#x27;shit&#x27; offensive. There was also the sight of Flo sitting on a toilet when Dorrie accidentally opened the door on her.

These changes were made to combat falling viewing figures, but it didn&#x27;t work and in April 1977 the series was cancelled due to declining ratings. Joe Hasham, Pat McDonald and Ron Shand were the only original cast members to remain to the final episode.

==Cast==

===Main / regular===
===Other===
Numerous stars wanted to appear in roles, even racing identity Gai Waterhouse, who unsuccessfully auditioned after completing a drama course in England. Also suggested was a young Bryan Brown (although having been in England, he had acquired a British accent, and was considered unsuitable by producer Bill Harmon, even though he hailed from Parramatta).

===Visit by royalty===
The Duke and Duchess of Bedford visited the set and appeared in a cameo in the series, in a storyline in which they come to visit Baroness Amanda Ashton / von Pappenburg (played by Carol Raye).

==Series background==
The series became famous for every episode ending in a cliffhanger and they were the first to do a summer cliffhanger, where the cliffhangers would be ramped up with every character in peril over the six week break the show took for the summer hiatus. In 1972, it was the car crash of Gordon (Joe James) and in 1973, Bev (Victoria Raymond) was shot. In 1974, Patti (Pamela Garrick) was the shock second victim of the Pantyhose Strangler, but in 1975, instead of a death, it was the mysterious resurrection of Jaja (Anya Saleky) who was thought to be dead. For its last summer cliffhanger, a drunk Herb (Ron Shand) was seen leaving Sydney on a train with a mystery blonde out to rob him.

During 1974, the series shifted its emphasis from sexual situations and drama to focus more on comedy. After the introduction of colour TV in 1975, ratings went into decline as its audience began switching over to bigger budget American shows (that year the show was only the third highest-rated show of the year, behind &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and repeats of &quot;Bewitched&quot;. A bold new storyline was devised to revitalise the series and in an unprecedented move, 40 complete scripts were discarded and rewritten. The &quot;Number 96&quot; set was sealed off to non-essential personnel with a new storyline involving a mysterious figure planting bombs, with several false alarms. The dramatic storyline was intended to draw back viewers and to provide a mechanism to quickly write out several existing characters in a bid to freshen up the cast of characters and revamp the storylines.

On Friday 5 September 1975, a planted bomb exploded in the delicatessen, destroying it and the adjacent wine bar, which was crowded with customers. The sequence was filmed on a Saturday because the studio was empty, and real gelignite was used, resulting in the studio doors being blown off their hinges.

The makers of the show made a bold move, killing off several long-running cast favourite&#x27;s which were revealed on the front page of newspapers on Monday 8 September 1975. They included Les (Gordon McDougall), Aldo and Roma Godolfus (Johnny Lockwood and Philippa Baker), and then revealing scheming Maggie Cameron (Bettina Welch) as the bomber and sending her off to prison. Maggie wanted to scare residents into moving so she could sell the building. Despite massive publicity, the bomb-blast storyline resulted in only a temporary boost to the program&#x27;s ratings, but it did provide material for future storyline&#x27;s, particularly with the trial of Maggie Cameron.

In October, Lucy and Alf Sutcliffe (played by original cast members Elisabeth Kirkby and James Elliott) were also written out of the series. New younger characters were added to the show, most of whom didn&#x27;t last out the series. Two that did were teenage sisters Debbie and Jane Chester (Dina Mann and Suzanne Church). They became orphans when their parents were taken by a shark in an obvious nod to shark film &quot;Jaws&quot;. Other enduring characters among the high cast turnover of the later period were new blonde sex-symbol Jaja Gibson (Anya Saleky), and Giovanni Lenzi (Harry Michaels), an exuberant Italian who worked in the deli.

1976 saw another whodunnit storyline with the Hooded Rapist, and there was now an increase in location shooting, including Moncur Street, Woollahra (outside the building used in the credits), local parks, Chinatown, and Luna Park.

===Series format===
The first episode began with an exterior shot of the building with moving vans being unloaded while Herb and Dorrie are heard having an argument. Each subsequent episode began with an exterior shot of the building while audio from the previous episode&#x27;s final scene could be heard. The shot would zoom in on the apartment in which that scene occurred, or remain unchanged, as the show&#x27;s title was displayed. The vision would then switch to the scene in question as a recap of the previous episode&#x27;s cliffhanger.

The series was broadcast as five half-hour episodes each week for its first four years. From the beginning of 1976 episodes were broadcast as two one-hour episodes each week in most areas. However, from an internal perspective episodes continued to be written and compiled in half-hour instalments.

===Film adaptation===
&quot;Number 96&quot; was adapted into a feature film in 1974 and titled &quot;Number 96&quot;. The feature film opened with Vera being gang-raped by bikies just before the opening titles. When asked why he chose to start the movie like this, (David Sale) quipped &quot;I wanted people to know they were in the right cinema.&quot;

One of its major drawcards was it being a full-colour production, unlike the series which was still broadcasting in monochrome. It had the same creative team and mostly the same cast as the series. Although it received mostly negative reviews, audiences lined up George Street to gain a seat on opening day. It earned nearly A$2.8 million on a A$100,000 budget, and was the most profitable Australian movie ever made at that time. It became the 5th highest grossing Australian movie of the 1970s. Film critics, unfamiliar with the TV series, were amazed that each character received a round of applause from the audience when they made their first appearance.

===Final night===
The final episode ended with a reunion curtain call of popular cast members past and present. A week after the airing of the final episode in Sydney, a televised public auction of props and costumes from the series was held in the grounds of Channel Ten.

==Cultural impact and reception==
&quot;Number 96&quot; was rated number 9 in the 2005 television special &quot;50 Years 50 Shows&quot;, which counted down Australia&#x27;s greatest television programs.
McKenzie Wark wrote in &quot;Celebrities, Culture and Cyberspace&quot; (published by Pluto Press, 1999): &quot;Once, when I was a kid, I was walking down a suburban street at night, when I noticed a rhythmic flickering of light from inside the houses. Though screened from view by the drawn curtains, the lights from a row of separate houses were all pulsing in time, and then I heard the music and I knew everyone was watching the same show ... Number 96.&quot;
John Singleton wrote: &quot;When Shakespeare was writing his plays, people queued up for Shakespeare. Today, they&#x27;re queuing up for &quot;Number 96&quot;, so in my opinion &quot;Number 96&quot; is today&#x27;s Shakespeare.&quot;
Phillip Adams, from newspaper &quot;The Age&quot;, wrote: &quot;I believe that television serials provide a surrogate sense of community and that many viewers are more involved in &quot;Number 96&quot; than they are in their own community.&quot;
The series was featured in cinema documentary &quot;Not Quite Hollywood&quot; (2008). Interviewees included &quot;Number 96&quot; actors Rebecca Gilling, Wendy Hughes, Lynette Curran, Briony Behets, Candy Raymond, Deborah Gray, Roger Ward, and Norman Yemm, and an associate producer of &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Unisexers&quot;, David Hannay.

===Cult status===
&quot;Number 96&quot; was the first Australian soap opera/serial to gain a significant cult following, prior to the network&#x27;s internationally successful series &quot;Prisoner&quot;. It led to huge merchandise such as tie-in novels and magazines, singles and LP records from cast members, a disco soundtrack album, a Family Circle cookbook with an iron-on T-shirt transfer, the 1974 feature film &quot;Number 96&quot;, and a 1980 American remake.

When the series started. its cast was one of the largest ever assembled for a local production. When it ended after 1218 episodes, it was the longest-running soap opera produced in Australia, having surpassed the ABC series &quot;Bellbird&quot;. &quot;Number 96&quot; was surpassed by &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; in 1982.
At the series&#x27; height, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated it was the highest-rated program of its kind in the world.
When the stars travelled from Sydney to Melbourne via train overnight to attend the Logie Awards ceremony, they were mobbed at country stations along the way during wild whistle stops. The crowds waiting in Melbourne was bigger than those that met The Beatles during their only Australian tour in 1964.

Whilst the program was extremely popular in Australia, its risqué subject matter and storylines meant it could not sell into any overseas markets. The show was written up in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, but it could never have screened in the United States, because of its nudity, homosexuality, and interracial romances.
It included veteran actors from Australia, mainly from the early days of radio and stage. As theatre had been their preferred form of entertainment, many stars, such as Wendy Blacklock, were reluctant to go into a TV serial, but once she got there, she remained until the final episode.

The series, although originally based on elements of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, which screened twice a week, was later likened more to US serial &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, which at its peak had three half-hour episodes a week. Neither show could match the Australian&#x27;s prestigious output of five half-hour episodes a week, and screening all year except for a six-week break over summer.

===Controversies===
The show attracted many complaints. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board repeatedly sanctioned the network. To keep the series on air, each episode was previewed to ensure it complied with control board guidelines. Sometimes, offending scenes were cut from the episode after its Sydney airing and were not seen when episode screened elsewhere. Consequently, the first episodes feature cuts and screen blackouts. Paperwork about the offensive material, which includes most of the Black Mass, survives with the National Film and Sound Archive, but the actual reel of footage has never been found. Eventually, due to the show&#x27;s popularity, the control board relaxed its restrictions and stopped previewing episodes. By the time the show was winding up in 1977, nobody seemed to be checking its output, which was far racier than anything that had been dared in its early years when it was under constant surveillance.

===Awards===
In addition to the four Logies won by cast member Pat McDonald during her run with the show, &quot;Number 96&quot; won both the &quot;Raw Prawn&quot; award in 1976 for Worst Drama, and &quot;Best Drama&quot; Logies in 1974, 1975, and 1976. Actor Bunney Brooke won the &quot;Best Actress&quot; Logie Award for her work as Flo in 1975.

The series cast became stars in Australia and had their own &quot;Number 96&quot; passenger train, specially designed for cast and crew travel, which for the show&#x27;s first few years they would take the train from Sydney to Melbourne for the annual &quot;TV Week&quot; Logie Awards in a silver multicarriaged train with the commissioner&#x27;s carriage hooked up at the rear for VIPs. This train was specially organised by publicity director Tom Greer. The 16-hour overnight journey left from the centre of Sydney at 4:30 pm with a farewell party, complete with red carpet and jazz band in attendance; it featured whistle stops at country sidings and saw thousands of people turn out to see their favourite stars, before it arrived at Spencer Street station. These whistle stops were all beamed back by television stations and went live to air. The rail service of the time was keen to promote its overnight tourism packages, and for the journey, the train was christened as the &quot;Spirit of 96&quot;.

A humorous story, as told by Greer, was the engagement of a piano player (the outrageous John McDonald) to entertain the cast on the train on the way to Melbourne. John could only play upright pianos. The railways rang and said they could not get the upright around the passageway corners of the train so it would be impossible to get it on board. Greer demanded it be put on the train somehow even if it meant dismantling the piano and putting it back together – &quot;key by key&quot;. In desperation, engineers arrived and took off the side of the carriage, loaded the piano on with a forklift, before replacing the carriage wall. The train used green steam locomotive number 3801, which frequently operated the &quot;Spirit of Progress&quot; train service between Sydney and Melbourne.

===Merchandise===
Eight paperback novelisations (1972–74) were sold under the Arkon imprint by Angus &amp; Robertson. Some of these were credited to &quot;Marina Campbell&quot;, a pseudonym of Anne Harrax. An original novel, &quot;96&quot; (Cover title: &quot;Number 96&quot;), was published by Stag in 1976.

In 1975, the &quot;Number 96 Cookbook&quot; was released in Australia by publisher Pacific Magazines (&quot;Family Circle&quot;)]; it featured photographs and recipes from eight members of the cast.

The series celebrated 1,000 episodes in 1976 with a compilation special, &quot;Number 96: And They Said It Wouldn&#x27;t Last&quot;, which reviewed the show&#x27;s most famous story lines and recounted the exploits of its departed main characters. &quot;And They Said It Wouldn&#x27;t Last&quot; was repeated at the start of 1977 with a new ending presented by Dina Mann. It is featured on the first DVD release, along with a new documentary that covered the show&#x27;s final 200 episodes.

===International screenings===
Cast members were amazed to learn the show briefly screened overseas. Cast member Bettina Welch reported seeing it dubbed in Italy, but this was never confirmed. Despite a short late-night run in Toronto, Canada, on edgy network Citytv, the content was too explicit for any US and UK television network. An attempt to sell the show at Cannes TV Festival in 1975 by using a topless model backfired when British newspaper &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported it got &quot;a swift &#x27;No Entry&#x27; sign&quot; from their broadcasters the BBC and ATV.&quot;
===American version===
In 1980, a short-lived US remake of the same name on NBC retained the comedy, but toned down the sexual elements of the series. The series was launched over three consecutive nights, from 10 to 12 December. US television and &quot;TV Guide&quot; promotions for the series used advertising hyperbole, suggesting that the series had been &quot;banned in Australia&quot;. The nudity and racy content of the original series were not present in the remake; it probably would not have been allowed in the US due to censorship standards there, so the US version only hinted at the sexual content that had been on display in the original. The US version of &quot;Number 96&quot; was quickly cancelled due to low ratings. The US show was finally aired in parts of Australia in 1986.

==Episodes==
==Availability==
From 4 February 1980, TEN-10 in Sydney commenced repeating the series at midnight Mondays through Thursdays, starting from episode 585, the first episode fully produced in colour. In 1994, Network Ten repeated the 1976 special &quot;And They Said It Wouldn&#x27;t Last&quot; with a new introduction by Abigail.

In November 1996, Network Ten screened a re-run of &quot;Number 96: The Movie&quot;.

Though the complete run of colour episodes (585–1218) survive, the National Film and Sound Archive retains only 19 of the first 584 black-and-white episodes. The rest were lost when the show switched to colour, with the master tapes wiped by the network for re-use, or made into a &quot;foyer display&quot;. The first three weeks (episodes 1–15), episodes 31–35 and two episodes from the 1974 black and white series (episodes 450 and 534) survive. With the exception of episodes 11, 12, 14, 15 and 534, all available black-and-white episodes have been released on DVD, along with &quot;Number 96: The Movie&quot; and the 1974 and 1975 episodes 649–712, 832–847. As of March 2022, 96 of 1218 episodes have been released in some form, with 560 episodes presumed lost.

===Home media===
&quot;Number 96: The Movie&quot; was released in a 2-disc collectors edition on Region 4 on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment, who subsequently released three volumes of episodes across 4 discs each. &quot;Number 96: The Movie&quot; was also included the compilation &quot;Ozploitation: Volume 4&quot; with five other Australian exploitation films.

<text>The Elbrus () is a line of Soviet and Russian computer systems developed by the Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering. These computers are used in the space program, nuclear weapons research, and defense systems, as well as for theoretical and researching purposes, such as an experimental Refal and CLU translators.

==History==

Historically, computers under the &quot;Elbrus&quot; brand comprised several different instruction set architectures (ISAs).

The first of them was the line of the large fourth-generation computers, developed by Vsevolod Burtsev. These were heavily influenced by the Burroughs large systems and similarly to them implemented tagged architecture and a variant of ALGOL-68 as system programming language.

After that Burtsev retired, and new Lebedev&#x27;s chief developer, Boris Babayan, introduced the completely new system architecture. Differing completely from the architecture of both Elbrus 1 and Elbrus 2, it employed a very long instruction word (VLIW) approach.

In 1992, a spin-off company Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies (MCST) was created and continued development, using the &quot;Elbrus&quot; moniker as a brand for all computer systems developed by the company.

In the late 1990s, a series of SPARC-based central processing units (CPUs) were developed at MCST as a way to raise funds for in-house semiconductor intellectual property core development and to fill the niche of domestically-developed CPUs for the backdoor-wary military.

In June 2024, a new computer based on the “Elbrus-2S3 (Эльбрус-2С3) microprocessor” was developed by Roselektronika.

In September 2024, The MCST company presented “Elbrus-2S3 (Эльбрус-2С3) microprocessor” at the 10th anniversary Russian forum &quot;Microelectronics 2024&quot;.

In December 2024, Programmable logic controllers &quot;PLC-Elbrus (based on the Elbrus-2S3 microprocessor) &quot; of the holding company &quot;Rostec Electronics&quot; of the State Corporation Rostec have passed state registration and are included in the register of software and hardware complexes of the Ministry of Digital Development of the Russian Federation. This allows using the devices at critical information infrastructure facilities to create automated process control systems.

<text>Caroline Amelia Nation (November 25, 1846June 9, 1911), often referred to as Carrie, Carry Nation, Carrie A. Nation, or Hatchet Granny, was an American who was a radical member of the temperance movement, which opposed alcohol before the advent of Prohibition. Nation is noted for attacking alcohol-serving establishments (most often taverns) with a hatchet. She married David Nation in 1874. She was previously known by either her birth name, Carrie Moore and, after her first marriage in 1867, as Carrie Gloyd. 

Nation was known as &quot;Mother Nation&quot; for the charity and religious work she did. Like many in the temperance movement, she considered drunkenness a cause of many of society&#x27;s problems. She attempted to help people in prison. In 1890, Nation founded a sewing circle in Medicine Lodge, Kansas to make clothing for the poor as well as prepare meals for them on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas.
In 1901, Nation established a shelter for wives and children of alcoholics in Kansas City, Missouri. This shelter would later be described as an &quot;early model for today&#x27;s battered women&#x27;s shelter&quot;.

In her autobiography, &quot;The Use and Need of the Life of Carry A. Nation&quot; (1908), she also strongly opposed Freemasonry. Nation was also concerned about tight clothing for women; she refused to wear a corset and urged women not to wear them because of their harmful effects on vital organs. She described herself as &quot;a bulldog running along at the feet of Jesus, barking at what He doesn&#x27;t like&quot;, and claimed a divine ordination to promote temperance by destroying bars.

==Early life and first marriage==
Caroline Amelia Moore was born in Garrard County, Kentucky, to George Moore and Mary Campbell. Her father was a successful farmer, stock trader, and slaveholder of Ulster Scot descent. During much of her early life, her health was poor and her family experienced financial setbacks. The family moved several times in Kentucky and finally settled in Belton, Missouri, in 1854.

In addition to their financial difficulties, many of Moore&#x27;s family members suffered from mental illness, her mother at times having delusions. There is speculation that the family did not stay in one place long because of rumors about Mary Moore&#x27;s mental state. Some writers have speculated that Mary believed she was Queen Victoria because of her finery and social airs. Mary lived in an insane asylum in Nevada, Missouri, from August 1890 until her death on September 28, 1893. Mary was put in the asylum through legal action by her son, Charles, although there is suspicion that Charles instigated the lawsuit because he owed Mary money.

The family moved to Texas as Missouri became involved in the Civil War in 1862. George did not fare well in Texas, and he moved his family back to Missouri. The family returned to High Grove Farm in Cass County. When the Union Army ordered them to evacuate their farm, they moved to Kansas City. Carrie nursed wounded soldiers after a raid on Independence, Missouri. The family again returned to their farm when the Civil War ended.

In 1865, Carrie met Charles Gloyd, a young physician who had fought for the Union, who was a severe alcoholic. Gloyd taught school near the Moores&#x27; farm while deciding where to establish his medical practice. He eventually settled on Holden, Missouri, and asked Moore to marry him. Moore&#x27;s parents objected to the union because they believed he was addicted to alcohol, but the marriage proceeded. They were married on November 21, 1867, and separated shortly before the birth of their daughter, Charlien, on September 27, 1868. Gloyd died in 1869 of alcoholism.

Influenced by the death of her husband, Carrie Gloyd developed a passionate activism against alcohol. With the proceeds from selling her inherited land (as well as that of her husband&#x27;s estate), she built a small house in Holden. Gloyd moved there with her mother-in-law and Charlien, and attended the Normal Institute in Warrensburg, Missouri, earning her teaching certificate in July 1872. Gloyd taught at a school in Holden for four years. She obtained a history degree and studied the influence of Greek philosophers on American politics.

==Second marriage and &quot;call from God&quot;==

In 1874, Gloyd married David A. Nation, an attorney, minister, newspaper journalist, and father, 19 years her senior.

The family purchased a 1,700 acre (690 ha) cotton plantation on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County, Texas. As neither knew much about farming, the venture was ultimately unsuccessful. They moved to Brazoria for David Nation to practice law. In about 1880, they moved to Columbia (now East Columbia) to operate the hotel owned by A. R. and Jesse W. Park. Her name is on the roll of Columbia Methodist Church in West Columbia. She lived at the hotel with her daughter, Charlien Gloyd, &quot;Mother Gloyd&quot; (Carrie&#x27;s first mother-in-law), and David&#x27;s daughter, Lola. Carrie Nation&#x27;s husband also operated a saddle shop just southwest of this site. The family soon moved to Richmond, Texas, to operate a hotel.

David Nation became involved in the Jaybird–Woodpecker War. As a result, he was forced to move back north to Medicine Lodge, Kansas, in 1889, where he found work preaching at a Christian church and Carrie ran a successful hotel.
Carrie Nation began her temperance work in Medicine Lodge by starting a local branch of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union and campaigning for the enforcement of Kansas&#x27; ban on the sale of liquor. Her methods escalated from simple protests to serenading saloon patrons with hymns accompanied by a hand organ, to greeting bartenders with pointed remarks such as, &quot;Good morning, destroyer of men&#x27;s souls.&quot; Dissatisfied with the results of her efforts, Nation began to pray to God for direction. On June 5, 1900, she felt she received her answer in the form of a heavenly vision. As Nation described it:The next morning I was awakened by a voice which seemed to me speaking in my heart, these words, &quot;GO TO KIOWA,&quot; and my hands were lifted and thrown down and the words, &quot;I&#x27;LL STAND BY YOU.&quot; The words, &quot;Go to Kiowa,&quot; were spoken in a murmuring, musical tone, low and soft, but &quot;I&#x27;ll stand by you,&quot; was very clear, positive and emphatic. I was impressed with a great inspiration, the interpretation was very plain, it was this: &quot;Take something in your hands, and throw at these places in Kiowa and smash them.&quot;

Responding to the revelation, Nation gathered several rocks – &quot;smashers&quot;, she called them – and proceeded to Dobson&#x27;s Saloon on June 7. Announcing &quot;Men, I have come to save you from a drunkard&#x27;s fate&quot;, she began to destroy the saloon&#x27;s stock with her cache of rocks. After she similarly destroyed two other saloons in Kiowa, a tornado hit eastern Kansas, which Nation took as divine approval of her actions.

==Hatchetations==
Carrie Nation continued her saloon destruction campaign in Kansas, her fame spreading through her growing arrest record. After she led a raid in Wichita, Kansas, Nation&#x27;s husband joked that she should use a hatchet next time for maximum damage. Nation replied, &quot;That is the most sensible thing you have said since I married you.&quot; The couple divorced in 1901; they had no children. Between 1902 and 1906, she lived in Guthrie, Oklahoma.

Alone or accompanied by hymn-singing women, Nation would march into a bar and sing and pray while smashing bar fixtures and stock with a hatchet. Between 1900 and 1910, she was arrested some 30 times for &quot;hatchetations&quot;, as she came to call them. Nation paid her jail fines from lecture-tour fees and sales of stick pins in the shape of hatchets. The souvenirs were provided by a Topeka, Kansas, pharmacist. Engraved on the handle of the hatchet, the pin reads, &quot;Death to Rum&quot;.
In April 1901, Nation went to Kansas City, Missouri, a city known for its wide opposition to the temperance movement, and smashed liquor in various bars on 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. She was arrested, taken to court, and fined although the judge suspended the fine under the condition that she never return to Kansas City. She was arrested more than 32 times—one report is that she was placed in the Washington, D.C., poorhouse for three days for refusing to pay a $35 fine.

Nation also conducted women&#x27;s rights marches in Topeka, Kansas. She led hundreds of women that were part of the Home Defender&#x27;s Army to march in opposition to saloons. In Amarillo, Texas, she received a strong response, as she was sponsored by the surveyor W. D. Twichell, an active Methodist layman.

Nation&#x27;s anti-alcohol activities became widely known, with the slogan &quot;All Nations Welcome But Carrie&quot; becoming a bar-room staple. She published &quot;The Smasher&#x27;s Mail&quot;, a biweekly newsletter, and &quot;The Hatchet&quot;, a newspaper.

==Later life and death==
Later in life Nation exploited her name by appearing in vaudeville in the United States and music halls in Great Britain. Nation, a proud woman more given to sermonizing than entertaining, found these venues uninspiring for her proselytizing. One of a number of pre-World War I acts that &quot;failed to click&quot; with foreign audiences, Nation was struck by an egg thrown by an audience member during one 1909 music hall lecture at the Canterbury Theatre of Varieties in Westminster, London. Indignantly, &quot;The Anti-Souse Queen&quot; ripped up her contract and returned to the United States. Seeking profits elsewhere, Nation sold photographs of herself, collected lecture fees, and marketed miniature souvenir hatchets. In October 1909, various press outlets reported that Nation claimed to have invented an aeroplane.

Near the end of her life, Nation moved to Eureka Springs, Arkansas, where she founded the home known as &quot;Hatchet Hall&quot;. She would give her final speech on January 14, 1911, when she had collapsed mid-way through, having previously suffered health problems. Nation fell into a coma and was taken to Evergreen Place Hospital, where she eventually died on June 9, 1911. She was buried in the southeastern side of Belton Cemetery in Belton, Missouri. The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union later erected a stone inscribed &quot;Faithful to the Cause of Prohibition, She Hath Done What She Could&quot; and the name &quot;Carry A. Nation&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1918, a drinking fountain was erected in Nation&#x27;s memory by the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. It is located at Naftzger Memorial Park in Wichita, Kansas. One myth is that the fountain was nearly destroyed at one time by a beer truck hitting it; Jamie Tracy, a curator of the Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum, has not found any evidence for this ironic tale. In July 2018 a life-size bronze statue of Nation was erected in front of the Eaton Hotel (at the time called the Carey Hotel), the location of her raid in Wichita, Kansas. 

In the satirical musical melodrama &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; the band the Kelly Affair change their name to the Carrie Nations. In the Kurt Vonnegut story, Welcome to the Monkey House, the fictional J. Edgar Nation&#x27;s name is a mixture made up from J. Edgar Hoover and Carrie Nation. F.B.I. director Hoover &quot;was vigorous in his moral judgments.&quot; Nation&#x27;s message is also present through the character Nancy McLuhan who is convinced that gin is the worst drug of all.

There is the play, &quot;Carry Nation&quot;; it ran on Broadway and starred American film actress Esther Dale. Beverly Wolff performed in the title role in Carry Nation the opera. Nation was portrayed by Valerie Buhagiar in Season 9 Episode 6 of the Canadian TV series &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot;. In &quot;Bar Fights&quot; (Episode 3, Season 4) of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Drunk History&quot;, Nation is portrayed by Vanessa Bayer. A fictionalized version of Nation is portrayed in the musical &quot;Queen of the Mist&quot;, wherein she crosses paths with Annie Edson Taylor. Nation was portrayed by Julia Murney in the original Off-Broadway production. 

Neil Munro gives a satirical account of an encounter with Carrie Nation in his Erchie MacPherson story, &quot;Erchie and Carrie&quot;, first published in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; of 14 December 1908. In 1977 Gary Dahl, inventor of the Pet Rock, used his proceeds from that fad to renovate and open a bar in Los Gatos, California which he jokingly named &quot;Carrie Nation&#x27;s Saloon.&quot; Broken Hatchet Brewing a microbrewery in Belton, Missouri is named in her &quot;honor&quot;.

Carry A. Nation House in Kentucky was a home of Carrie Nation, and was a 10-room house then. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Garrard County, Kentucky, United States. It was built in 1846. Nation&#x27;s home in Medicine Lodge, Kansas, the Carrie Nation House, was bought by the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union in the 1950s and was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1976.

<text>An intraplate earthquake occurs in the &quot;interior&quot; of a tectonic plate, in contrast to an interplate earthquake on the &quot;boundary&quot; of a tectonic plate. They are relatively rare compared to the more familiar interplate earthquakes. Buildings far from plate boundaries are rarely protected with seismic retrofitting, so large intraplate earthquakes can inflict heavy damage. Examples of damaging intraplate earthquakes are the devastating 2001 Gujarat earthquake, the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes, the 2017 Puebla earthquake, the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes, and the 1886 Charleston earthquake. An earthquake that occurs within a subducting plate is known as an intraslab earthquake.

==Description==
The Earth&#x27;s crust is made up of seven primary and eight secondary tectonic plates, plus dozens of tertiary microplates. The large plates move very slowly on top of convection currents in the underlying mantle. Because they do not all move in the same direction, plates often directly collide or slide laterally along each other, a tectonic environment that makes interplate earthquakes frequent.

By contrast, relatively few earthquakes occur in intraplate environments away from plate junctures. These earthquakes often occur at the location of ancient failed rifts, partial fractures of existing plates, because they may leave a weakness in the crust vulnerable to regional tectonic strain.

Intraslab earthquakes radiate more seismic energy than interplate earthquakes (megathrust earthquakes) of a similar magnitude. This variation makes &quot;seismic energy&quot; a better measure for the potential macroseismic effects of an earthquake than the more common &quot;seismic moment&quot; used to calculate the magnitude .

==Examples==
Examples of intraplate earthquakes include those in Mineral, Virginia, in 2011 (estimated magnitude 5.8), Newcastle, New South Wales in 1989, New Madrid in 1811 and 1812 (estimated magnitude as high as 8.6), the Boston (Cape Ann) earthquake of 1755 (estimated magnitude 6.0 to 6.3), earthquakes felt in New York City in 1737 and 1884 (both quakes estimated at 5.5 magnitude), and the Charleston earthquake in South Carolina in 1886 (estimated magnitude 6.5 to 7.3). The Charleston quake was particularly surprising because, unlike Boston and New York, the area had almost no history of even minor earthquakes.

In 2001, a large intraplate earthquake devastated the region of Gujarat, India. The earthquake occurred far from any plate boundaries, which meant the region above the epicenter was unprepared for earthquakes. In particular, the Kutch district suffered tremendous damage, where the death toll was over 12,000 and the total death toll was higher than 20,000.

In 2017, the 24–29 km deep magnitude 6.5 Botswana earthquake that shook eastern Botswana occurred at over 300 km from the nearest active plate boundary. The event occurred in an underpopulated area of Botswana.

The 1888 earthquake in Río de la Plata was an intraplate quake, from reactivated faults in the Quilmes Trough, far from the boundaries of the South American plate. With a magnitude greater than 5.0 it was felt &quot;in the cities of Buenos Aires, La Plata and other small towns and villages along the Rio de Plata coastal regions.&quot; The towns of Punta del Este and Maldonado in Uruguay were hit by a tsunami generated by the quake.

==Causes==
Many cities live with the seismic risk of a rare, large intraplate earthquake. The cause of these earthquakes is often uncertain. In many cases, the causative fault is deeply buried and sometimes cannot even be found. Some studies have shown that quakes can be caused by fluids moving up the crust along ancient fault zones. In such circumstances, it is difficult to estimate the seismic hazard for a given city, especially if there was only one earthquake in historical times. Some progress is being made in understanding the fault mechanics driving these earthquakes.

Intraplate earthquakes may be unrelated to ancient fault zones and instead caused by deglaciation or erosion.

==Prediction==
Scientists continue to search for the causes of these earthquakes, and especially for some indication of how often they recur. The best success has come with detailed micro-seismic monitoring, involving dense arrays of seismometers. In this manner, very small earthquakes associated with a causative fault can be located with great accuracy, and in most cases these line up in patterns consistent with faulting. Cryoseisms can sometimes be mistaken for intraplate earthquakes.

==Intraslab earthquake==
In seismology, an intraslab earthquake occurs within a subducting plate, known as slabs. They are most frequent in older slabs which are colder, whereas younger slabs that are warmer rarely produces earthquake. They can be detected within these slabs at depths exceeding ; they are also the source of intermediate and deep-focus earthquakes. Intraslab earthquakes at depths are considered shallow earthquakes and can be destructive to cities. One of the deadliest earthquakes of the 20th century was the 1970 Ancash earthquake, measuring 7.9 and occurring off the coast of Peru. The 2001 Nisqually and 1949 Olympia earthquakes were also intraslab events.

<text>Bryde&#x27;s whale ( ), or the Bryde&#x27;s whale complex, putatively comprises three species of rorqual and maybe four. The &quot;complex&quot; means the number and classification remains unclear because of a lack of definitive information and research. The common Bryde&#x27;s whale (Balaenoptera brydei, Olsen, 1913) is a larger form that occurs worldwide in warm temperate and tropical waters, and the Sittang or Eden&#x27;s whale (Balaenoptera edeni, Anderson, 1879) is a smaller form that may be restricted to the Indo-Pacific. Also, a smaller, coastal form of &quot;B. brydei&quot; is found off southern Africa, and perhaps another form in the Indo-Pacific differs in skull morphology, tentatively referred to as the Indo-Pacific Bryde&#x27;s whale. The recently described Omura&#x27;s whale (&quot;B. omurai&quot;, Wada et al. 2003), was formerly thought to be a pygmy form of Bryde&#x27;s, but is now recognized as a distinct species. Rice&#x27;s whale (&quot;B. ricei&quot;), which makes its home solely in the Gulf of Mexico, was once considered a distinct population of Bryde&#x27;s whale, but in 2021 it was described as a separate species.

&quot;B. brydei&quot; gets its specific and common name from Johan Bryde, Norwegian consul to South Africa, who helped establish the first modern whaling station in the country, while &quot;B. edeni&quot; gets its specific and common names from Sir Ashley Eden, former High Commissioner of Burma (Myanmar). Sittang whale refers to the type locality of the species.

== Etymology ==
In Japan, early whalers called it or . It preys on the anchovy and it was commonly associated with the skipjack. As modern whaling shifted to the Sanriku area, whalemen confused the sei whale with it; now only applies to the latter. Incidentally, anchovies are dominant prey for both species off Japan. They are now called , for their resemblance to the sei whale.

== Taxonomy ==

The taxonomy is poorly characterised. The two genetically distinct, candidate species/subspecies/morphologies are Bryde&#x27;s whale &quot;B. brydei&quot; and the Sittang or Eden&#x27;s whale &quot;B. edeni&quot;, that differentiate by geographic distribution, inshore/offshore preferences, and size. For both putative species, the scientific name &quot;B. edeni&quot; is commonly used or they are simply referred to &quot;B.&quot; cf &quot;brydei/edeni&quot;.

In 1878, the Scottish zoologist John Anderson, first curator of the Indian Museum in Calcutta, described &quot;Balaenoptera edeni&quot;, naming it after the former British High Commissioner in Burma, Sir Ashley Eden, who helped obtain the type specimen. Eden&#x27;s Deputy Commissioner, Major A.G. Duff, sent a Mr Duke, one of his assistants, to Thaybyoo Creek, between the Sittang and Beeling Rivers, on the Gulf of Martaban, where he found a whale, which had stranded there in June 1871 after swimming more than up the creek—it was said to have &quot;exhausted itself by its furious struggles&quot; to get free and &quot;roared like an elephant&quot; before finally expiring. Despite terrible weather, he was able to secure almost the entire skull and nearly all its vertebrae, along with other bones. These were sent to Anderson, who described the specimen, which was physically mature, as a new species. In 1913, the Norwegian scientist Ørjan Olsen, based on the examination of a dozen &quot;sei whales&quot; brought to the whaling stations at Durban and Saldanha, in South Africa, described &quot;Balaenoptera brydei&quot;, naming it after the Norwegian consul to South Africa Johan Bryde. In 1950, the Dutch scientist G.C.A. Junge, after comparing specimens of &quot;B. edeni&quot; and &quot;B. brydei&quot; with a , physically mature specimen that had stranded on Pulau Sugi, an island between Singapore and Sumatra, in July 1936, synonymized the two species into &quot;B. edeni&quot;.

In the 1950s it was discovered that there were two types of &quot;sei whale&quot; off Japan, a northern form with longer, finer baleen and shorter ventral grooves and a southern form with shorter, coarser baleen and longer ventral grooves. They also differed in the shape of the palate. The former was caught off northeastern Honshu and eastern Hokkaido, while the latter was taken off western Kyushu and southern Honshu. Both were caught off the Bonin Islands, but at different seasons. It was realized that the northern form were indeed sei whales (&quot;B. borealis&quot;), but the southern form were Bryde&#x27;s whale (&quot;B. brydei/edeni&quot;). A later study revealed that Bryde&#x27;s caught off Japan exhibited lateral ridges on their rostrum, whereas sei whales lacked this feature.

In the 1960s it was discovered that some of the &quot;sei whales&quot; being caught off Brazil were also Bryde&#x27;s whales based on the same characters that distinguished the two species off Japan (i.e. three ridges on the rostrum versus one, shape of the palate, texture of the baleen, length of the ventral grooves).

== Description ==
Several differences in anatomy are found between Bryde&#x27;s and Eden&#x27;s whales; morphological similarities have caused confusions regarding species identification.

=== Size ===

Members of the Bryde&#x27;s whale complex are moderately-sized rorquals, falling behind sei whales, but being larger than Omura&#x27;s whale and the relatively small minke whales. The largest measured by Olsen (1913) was a female caught off Durban in November 1912, while the longest of each sex measured by Best (1977) at the Donkergat whaling station in Saldanha Bay, South Africa, were a female caught in October 1962 and a male caught in April 1963; both were the offshore form. At physical maturity, the coastal form off South Africa averages for males and for females, while the South Africa offshore form averages . The coastal form near Japan is slightly smaller, with adult males averaging and adult females . At sexual maturity, males average and females near Japan. Sexual maturity is reached at 8–11 years for both sexes in the offshore form off South Africa. At birth, they are . The body mass of Bryde&#x27;s whales can range .

=== External appearance ===

The Bryde&#x27;s whale is a baleen whale, more specifically a rorqual belonging to the same group as blue whales and humpback whales. It has twin blowholes with a low splashguard to the front. Like other rorquals, it has no teeth, but has two rows of baleen plates.

Bryde&#x27;s whales closely resemble their close relative the sei whale. They are remarkably elongated (even more so than fin whales), with the greatest height of the body being one seventh their total length—compared to 1/6.5 to 1/6.75 in fin whales and only 1/5.5 in sei whales. Bryde&#x27;s are dark smoky grey dorsally and usually white ventrally, whereas sei whales are often a galvanized blue-grey dorsally and have a variably sized white patch on the throat, a posteriorly oriented white anchor-shaped marking between the pectoral fins, and are blue-grey beyond the anus—although Bryde&#x27;s off South Africa can have a similar irregular white patch on the throat. Bryde&#x27;s have a straight rostrum with three longitudinal ridges that extend from the blowholes, where the auxiliary ridges begin as depressions, to the tip of the rostrum. The sei whale, like other rorquals, has a single median ridge, as well as a slightly arched rostrum, which is accentuated at the tip. Bryde&#x27;s usually have dark grey lower jaws, whereas sei whales are lighter grey. Bryde&#x27;s have 250–370 pairs of short, slate grey baleen plates with long, coarse, lighter grey or white bristles that are long by wide, while sei whales have longer, black or dark grey baleen plates with short, curling, wool-like bristles.

The 40 to 70 ventral pleats extend to or past the umbilicus, occupying about 58% and 57% of the total length, respectively; sei whales, though, have ventral pleats that extend only halfway between the pectoral fins and umbilicus, occupying only 45–47% of the total body length, whereas their umbilicus is usually 52% of the total body length. Both species are often covered with white or pink oval scars caused by bites from cookie-cutter sharks.

Bryde&#x27;s whales have an upright, falcate dorsal fin that is up to in height, average , and is usually between . It is often frayed or ragged along its rear margin and located about two-thirds of the way along the back. The broad, centrally notched tail flukes rarely break the surface. The flippers are small and slender.

== Behaviour ==
Their blow is columnar or bushy, about high. Sometimes, they blow or exhale while under water. Bryde&#x27;s whales display seemingly erratic behaviour compared to other baleen whales, because they surface at irregular intervals and can change directions for unknown reasons.

They usually appear individually or in pairs, and occasionally in loose aggregations up to 20 animals around feeding areas. They are more active on the water surface than sei whales, especially in coastal waters.

=== Breathing ===
They regularly dive for about 5–15 minutes (maximum of 20 minutes) after four to seven blows. Bryde&#x27;s whales are capable of reaching depths down to . When submerging, these whales do not display their flukes. Bryde&#x27;s whales commonly swim at , but can reach . They sometimes generate short (0.4 seconds) powerful, low-frequency vocalizations that resemble a human moan.

=== Diet ===

Bryde&#x27;s whales feed on a wide variety of fish, planktonic crustaceans, and cephalopods. In the western North Pacific, Bryde&#x27;s whales caught by Japanese scientific whaling vessels (2000–2007) mainly fed on Japanese anchovy (&quot;Engraulis japonicus&quot;, 52%) and various species of euphausiid (36%, including &quot;Euphausia similis&quot;, &quot;E. gibboides&quot;, &quot;Thysanoessa gregaria&quot;, and &quot;Nematoscelis difficilis&quot;), as well as oceanic lightfish (&quot;Vinciguerria nimbaria&quot;, nearly 3%), and mackerels (&quot;Scomber&quot; spp., less than 2%). The prey differed by location and season. In coastal areas, euphausiids dominated the diet, comprising 89 and 75% of the diet in May and June, respectively. Further offshore, Japanese anchovy was the dominant species, accounting for nearly 100% of the diet in late summer. Based on the stomach contents of Bryde&#x27;s whales caught by Japanese pelagic whaling expeditions in the North Pacific in the 1970s, the majority were found to feed on euphausiids (nearly 89%), whereas only about 11% fed on fish.
Off South Africa, prey preferences differed between the inshore and offshore forms. The former mainly feed on anchovies (&quot;Engraulis capensis&quot;, 83%), maasbankers (&quot;Trachurus trachurus&quot;, 36%), and pilchards (&quot;Sardinops ocellata&quot;, 33%), with only one (or 3%) being found with euphausiids (&quot;Nyctiphanes capensis&quot;). The latter, however, mainly feed on euphausiids (primarily &quot;Euphausia lucens&quot;, but also &quot;E. recurva&quot;, &quot;N. capensis&quot;, and &quot;Thysanoessa gregaria&quot;), as well as various deep-sea fish (including Mueller&#x27;s pearlside, &quot;Maurolicus muelleri&quot;, and a species of &quot;Lestidium&quot;). One was even found &quot;full of baby squid&quot; (later identified as &quot;Lycoteuthis diadema&quot;).

In the Gulf of California, they mainly feed on Pacific sardine (&quot;Sardinops sagax&quot;) and Pacific thread herring (&quot;Opisthonema libertate&quot;) (about 88%), but also feed on euphausiids (mostly &quot;Nyctiphanes simplex&quot;, 11%). They have also been observed feeding on pelagic red crabs (&quot;Pleuroncodes planipes&quot;) off southern Baja California. In the Coral Sea, the South Pacific, and the Indian Ocean, they appear to mainly feed on euphausiids, while off Brazil, they have been observed feeding on sardines. Individuals caught off Western Australia were found with anchovies (&quot;E. australis&quot;) in their stomachs (though these individuals may refer to Omura&#x27;s whale). Bryde&#x27;s whales use several feeding methods, including skimming the surface, lunging, and bubble nets especially within Gulf of Tosa.

Along southeastern coasts of Brazil, whales add twisting movements to lunge feeding.

In the Pacific and northern Indian Ocean, Bryde&#x27;s whales have been observed employing &quot;tread-water feeding&quot; or &quot;trap feeding,&quot; a behaviour more commonly known from the northern Gulf of Thailand which is also performed by humpback whales in the northeastern Pacific.

=== Reproduction and nurturing ===

Bryde&#x27;s whales breed in alternate years, apparently in any season, with an autumnal peak. Their gestation period is estimated at 12 months. Calves are about long at birth and weigh . They become sexually mature at 8–13 years of age, when females are . The mother nurses for 6–12 months.

=== Vocalizations ===
In 2014, a mysterious sound, dubbed a Biotwang, was discovered in underwater recordings from the Mariana Archipelago. It was assumed to be produced by a baleen whale of unknown species. In 2024 that sound was shown to come from Bryde’s whales.

== Distribution ==

=== &quot;B. brydei&quot; ===
&quot;B. brydei&quot; occurs in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans between the 40th parallels of latitude, preferring highly productive, tropical, subtropical, and warm, temperate waters of . In the North Pacific, they occur as far north as Honshu to the west and southern California in the east, with vagrants reported as far north as Washington in the United States. They occur throughout the eastern tropical Pacific, including Peru and Ecuador, where they are absent from July to September. They have also been reported in an upwelling area off Chile between 35° and 37°S. In the southwestern Pacific, they occur as far south as the North Island of New Zealand.

Based on osteological features, a specimen from Taiwan was referred to &quot;B. brydei&quot;, while several specimens from the Philippines and Indonesia differed slightly in skull morphology and were referred to the putative Indo-Pacific Bryde&#x27;s whale. Mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that Bryde&#x27;s whales caught in the pelagic western North Pacific and Bonin Islands (resident population), as well as biopsy samples taken from whales off Hawaii, the west coast of Baja California, and the southern Gulf of California, belonged to &quot;B. brydei&quot;. Resident or semi-resident groups also exist off Hawaiian and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands,&lt;ref name=&quot;CETACEAN ABUNDANCE IN HAWAIIAN WATERS DURING SUMMER/FALL OF 2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Northern Mariana Islands.

Bryde&#x27;s whales do not occur within central to northern Sea of Japan on regular basis or at least in large numbers. One of the northernmost records in modern times was of a beached, 5-meter-long specimen at Nakhodka in 2011.

&quot;B. brydei&quot; occurs throughout the Indian Ocean north of about 35°S. Those of the southern Indian Ocean appear to correspond to &quot;B. brydei&quot;, as do the individuals illegally caught by the Soviets in the 1960s in the northwest Indian Ocean, as well as the Maldives. Individuals sighted in the Red Sea may or may not be &quot;B. brydei&quot;.

In the North Atlantic, they have been recorded as far north as Cape Hatteras. They occur throughout the wider Caribbean—two specimens from Aruba were found through mtDNA analysis to be firmly placed within &quot;B. brydei&quot; and to form a clade with a specimen from Madeira and individuals of the offshore form of South Africa. They were first recorded in the Azores in 2004 and showing mixed traits of offshore and inshore forms, but do not occur in the Mediterranean Sea (regarding the bones of a baleen whale found, Bryde&#x27;s whale was listed as one of suggested species). They appear to occur off Brazil year-round, such as around Rio de Janeiro—Cape Frio, Armação dos Búzios, entrance to Guanabara Bay, Ilha Anchieta State Park, Ilha Grande, and so on. Individuals of the inshore form off South Africa are also resident year-round, occurring mainly between Cape Recife and Saldanha Bay, whereas the larger offshore form migrates to West African equatorial waters in the winter. Regular occurrences have been noted around Cape Verde as well.

=== &quot;B. edeni&quot; ===

The type specimen is from the Gulf of Martaban coast of Myanmar, while other referred specimens were found on the Bay of Bengal coast of Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Thailand to Vietnam, Taiwan and continental China. A population found off southern and southwestern Japan in the East China Sea has also been referred to &quot;B. edeni&quot;. A whale stranded in Hong Kong and another saved from a river in eastern Australia were found to be closely related to the Junge specimen and the East China Sea whales. Bryde&#x27;s whale (most had auxiliary ridges) of small size—estimated at in length—sighted off the northeastern side of the Solomon Islands during a survey in late November and early December 1993 may be referable to &quot;B. edeni&quot;. Four of the whales, estimated at in length, were accompanied by calves that ranged from in length. It is unknown whether eight small individuals—reaching only at maturity—caught off western and eastern Australia between 1958 and 1963 are specimens of &quot;B. edeni&quot; or &quot;B. omurai&quot;. Along Chinese coasts, for example, whales were once thought to be abundant along southern coasts from Fujian and Guangdong Provinces to Hainan Island and the north-eastern tip of the Gulf of Tonkin such as off Tieshangang District and around Weizhou and Xieyang Islands.

== Population ==
The population may include up to 90,000–100,000 animals worldwide, with two-thirds inhabiting the Northern Hemisphere.

For management purposes, the U.S. population is divided into three groups: the Eastern Tropical Pacific stock (11,000–13,000 animals) and the Hawaiian stock (350–500) and an endangered stock of about 100 whales in the Gulf of Mexico. As of 2016, the Bryde&#x27;s whale is considered to be critically endangered in New Zealand as there are approximately 200 left in the wild.

Prior to 2006, only two confirmed sightings of Bryde&#x27;s whale had been reported in the eastern North Pacific north of Baja California—one in January 1963, only a kilometer off La Jolla (originally misidentified as a fin whale), and another in October 1991 west of Monterey Bay. Between August 2006 and September 2010, six sightings were made by scientists in the Southern California Bight. Five were west of San Clemente Island, and one between San Clemente Island and Santa Catalina Island. All but one involved single individuals. Another sighting was made off Dana Point, California, on 19 September 2009, which was originally misidentified as a fin whale.

In general, data are insufficient to determine population trends.

== Conservation ==

&quot;Balaenoptera edeni&quot; is listed as least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

It is listed in Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I, which prohibits commercial international trade.

&quot;Balaenoptera brydei&quot; has yet to be evaluated.

Bryde&#x27;s whale is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

In addition, Bryde&#x27;s whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

=== Whaling ===
Historically, this species was not significantly targeted by commercial whalers, but became more important in the 1970s as the industry depleted other targets. Artisanal whalers have taken them off the coasts of Indonesia and the Philippines.

Modern whaling for Bryde&#x27;s whales is thought to have begun from coastal stations in Japan in 1906, where it continued uninterrupted until 1987—they were also caught offshore in the western North Pacific by both Japanese (1971–79) and Soviet (1966–79) fleets, as well as from Taiwan (1976–80), the Bonin Islands (1946–52 and 1981–87), and the Philippines (1983–85). In 1997, an estimated over 20,000 Bryde&#x27;s whales had been caught in the western North Pacific between 1911 and 1987 (the Japanese were later found to have falsified their reported take from the Bonin Islands between 1981 and 1987, reporting a catch of only 2,659 instead of the true take of 4,162). A population assessment done in the mid-1990s stated that the population in the western North Pacific may have declined by as much as 49% during 1911–96. Norwegian factory ships off Baja California took an additional 34 Bryde&#x27;s whales between 1924 and 1929; two were also caught off central California in 1966.

An estimated 5,542 Bryde&#x27;s whales were caught off Peru between 1968 and 1983, including a reported catch of 3,589 between 1973 and 1983. An unknown number were also caught off Chile from 1932 to 1979. Over 2,000 were caught off Cape Province, South Africa, from 1911 to 1967, most (1,300) during 1947–67. The majority of the 2,536 sei whales caught by the pirate whaler &quot;Sierra&quot; in the South Atlantic between 1969 and 1976 are believed to have been Bryde&#x27;s whales. At least some Bryde&#x27;s whales were among the 5,000 sei whales recorded in the catch off Brazil from 1948 to 1977, but possibly only 8%.

Over 30,000 Bryde&#x27;s whales were caught between 1911 and &#x27;87, including over 1,400 taken by the Soviets in the Southern Hemisphere from 1948 to 1973 (only 19 were reported). The peak reported catches were reached in 1973–74 and 1974–75, when over 1,800 were taken each year.

=== Other threats and incidents ===
Around 2011, a videographer named Michael Fishbach filmed a Bryde&#x27;s whale weighing being hunted and killed by a pack of 20 orca in the Sea of Cortez.
Bryde&#x27;s whales have not been reported as taken or injured in fishing operations. They are sometimes killed or injured by ship strikes. Anthropogenic noise is an increasing concern for all rorquals, which communicate by low-frequency sounds.

These whales are protected off the US by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.

In March 2019, a diver off the coast of South Africa was accidentally caught in the mouth of a feeding Bryde&#x27;s whale. The diver and tour-operator, Rainer Schimpf, was photographing sharks circling a bait-ball of fish, when the whale suddenly appeared from below and opened its mouth near the surface in an attempt to swallow the fish. In doing so, it accidentally engulfed Schimpf as well; his entire upper body (down to his waist) went into the whale&#x27;s mouth. The whale gripped him with its jaws for a few moments as Schimpf held his breath and feared the whale would deep dive. Soon after the whale submerged again, it quickly spat Schimpf (who was unharmed) back out and swam away.

Tourists on jet skis have harassed whales off the gulf coast of Phetchaburi Province, Thailand.

<doc id="230518" wikidata="Q3687374" url="?curid=230518" title="Pastoral council">
<text>A pastoral council is a consultative body in dioceses and parishes of the Catholic Church that serves to advise the parish priest or bishop about pastoral issues. The council&#x27;s main purpose is to investigate, reflect and reach conclusions about pastoral matters to recommend to the parish priest or bishop as appropriate.

== Number ==
A 2003 survey by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops found half of U.S. dioceses and three-quarters of U.S. parishes had councils. Council guidelines have different recommendations about the size of the council. The average is 15 members.

== Scope ==
Bishops and priests may consult their councils about practical matters. On the diocesan level, this may include &quot;missionary, catechetical and apostolic undertakings within the diocese, concerning the promotion of doctrinal formation and the sacramental life of the faithful; concerning pastoral activities to help the priests in the various social and territorial areas of the diocese; concerning public opinion on matters pertaining to the Church as it is more likely to be fostered in the present time; etc.&quot; (&quot;Circular Letter on &#x27;Pastoral Councils,&#x27;&quot; (Omnes Christifideles) published in 1973 by the Sacred Congregation for the Clergy, no 9).

== Vatican II origins ==
The concept of the pastoral council was first articulated in the 1965 Vatican II &quot;Decree on Bishops&quot; (&quot;Christus Dominus&quot;, par. 27). The decree recommended that bishops establish diocesan pastoral councils with a threefold purpose. The purpose is to investigate pastoral matters, to ponder or reflect over them, and to reach conclusions that the council can recommend to the bishop.

Six other official documents of the Church define the diocesan pastoral council in this threefold way:
*Paul VI, &quot;Ecclesiae Sanctae I&quot; (1966) no. 16;
*the 1971 Synod of Bishops&#x27; &quot;The Ministerial Priesthood,&quot; art. 2, II, section 3;
*the 1973 &quot;Directory on the Pastoral Ministry of Bishops,&quot; no. 204;
*the 1973 &quot;Circular Letter on &#x27;Pastoral Councils&#x27;&quot; by the Sacred Congregation for the Clergy, no 9;
* the 2002 &quot;Instruction&quot; by the Congregation for the Clergy, &quot;The Priest, Pastoral and Leader&quot; (par 26); and
* the 2004 &quot;Directory&quot; by the Congregation for Bishops, &quot;Apostolorum successores&quot; (par. 184).

In a 1988 address to the bishops of Chile, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger spoke of Vatican II as a &quot;pastoral council&quot; with a modest intent, and not as a &quot;rupture with tradition&quot; as described by Marcel Lefebvre.

== Canon law ==
Canon 511 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law speaks about &quot;diocesan&quot; pastoral councils: &quot;In each diocese, to the extent that pastoral circumstances recommend it, a pastoral council is to be established whose responsibility it is to investigate under the authority of the bishop all those things which pertain to pastoral works, to ponder them and to propose practical conclusions about them.&quot; This reflects the threefold purpose of the pastoral council as first described in the Vatican II &quot;Decree on Bishops&quot; at paragraph 27.

Canon 536 of the 1983 Code legislates about &quot;parish&quot; pastoral councils. It states that &quot;§1. If the diocesan bishop judges it opportune after he has heard the presbyteral council, a pastoral council is to be established in each parish, over which the pastor presides and in which the Christian faithful, together with those who share in pastoral care by virtue of their office in the parish, assist in fostering pastoral activity. §2. A pastoral council possesses a consultative vote only and is governed by the norms established by the diocesan bishop.&quot;

Consequently, the establishment of parish pastoral councils depends upon the judgment of the diocesan bishop, after having consulted his presbyteral council. If he judges it appropriate, a pastoral council is established in each parish of his diocese.

== More recent documents ==
The purpose of the parish pastoral council, as described in Canon 536, is the &quot;fostering&quot; of &quot;pastoral activity&quot; in the parish. Because the pastor is the proper shepherd of the parish, it follows that his pastoral council possesses a consultative vote only. In fact, the 1997 &quot;Instruction on Certain Questions Regarding the Collaboration of the Non-Ordained Faithful in the Sacred Ministry of Priest&quot; states that, &quot;It is for the Parish Priest to preside at parochial councils. They are to be considered invalid, and hence null and void, any deliberations entered into, (or decisions taken), by a parochial council which has not been presided over by the Parish Priest or which has assembled contrary to his wishes&quot; (Article 5, § 3).

According to &quot;The Priest, Pastor and Leader of the Parish Community&quot;, the 2002 Instruction of the Sacred Congregation for the Clergy, &quot;The basic task of such a council is to serve, at institutional level, the orderly collaboration of the faithful in the development of pastoral activity which is proper to priests. The pastoral council is thus a consultative organ in which the faithful, expressing their baptismal responsibility, can assist the parish priest, who presides at the council, by offering their advice on pastoral matters. The lay faithful ought to be ever more convinced of the special meaning that their commitment to the apostolate takes on in their parish; hence it is necessary to have a more convinced, extensive and decided appreciation for &#x27;Parish Pastoral Councils&#x27;. There are clear reasons for such: In the present circumstances the lay faithful have the ability to do very much and, therefore, ought to do very much towards the growth of an authentic ecclesial communion in their parishes in order to reawaken missionary zeal towards nonbelievers and believers themselves who have abandoned the faith or grown lax in the Christian life&quot;.

&quot;All of the faithful have the right, sometimes even the duty, to make their opinions known on matters concerning the good of the Church. This can happen through institutions which have been established to facilitate that purpose: [...]the pastoral council can be a most useful aid...providing proposals and suggestions on missionary, catechetical and apostolic initiatives [..] as well as on the promotion of doctrinal formation and the sacramental life of the faithful; on the assistance to be given to the pastoral work of priests in various social and territorial situations; on how better to influence public opinion etc. The pastoral council is to be seen in relation to the context of the relationship of mutual service that exists between a parish priest and his faithful. It would therefore be senseless to consider the pastoral council as an organ replacing the parish priest in his government of the parish, or as one which, on the basis of a majority vote, materially constrains the parish priest in his direction of the parish.&quot;

== United States==

In American Roman Catholic parishes, the parish council arose after Vatican II in the new era of lay participation in parish decision making. It was a response to the Vatican II Decree on the Apostolate of Lay People (Apostolicam actuositatem, par. 26). This decree, published in 1965, recommended the establishment of councils at all levels of the Catholic Church (including the parish) with one purpose, namely, to assist in the Church&#x27;s &quot;apostolate&quot; or mission. The decree also said that such apostolic councils &quot;may coordinate&quot; lay initiatives, so long as they do not interfere with the autonomy of such initiatives. Many Catholics throughout the world interpreted the decree as calling for parish councils that would coordinate parish committees or commissions. This was the genesis of the &quot;parish council&quot;.

=== Development into pastoral councils ===
In 1983, the revised Code of Canon Law was published. It did not refer to par. 26 of the Decree on the Laity, nor did it speak of &quot;apostolic&quot; councils or &quot;parish councils&quot; per se. Instead, in canon 536, it recommended (but did not mandate) &quot;pastoral&quot; councils at the parish level [see the article on &quot;pastoral&quot; councils].

The idea of the &quot;pastoral&quot; council had its genesis in the 1965 Vatican II Decree on Bishops (Christus Dominus, par. 27). This decree recommended &quot;pastoral&quot; councils at the diocesan level (but not at the parish level). Canon 536 applied the &quot;pastoral&quot; council idea to parishes. The &quot;pastoral&quot; council (according to the decree) has a threefold purpose. It (1) investigates pastoral matters, (2) ponders or reflects on them, and (3) reaches conclusions, conclusions that are recommended to the pastor. When the new Code was promulgated, it clarified the identity of what had hitherto been called the &quot;parish&quot; councils. These councils were now &quot;parish pastoral&quot; councils with a &quot;consultative only&quot; vote.

=== Threefold purpose ===
Canon 536 (which recommends parish pastoral councils) defines the purpose of councils in an extremely brief way. It says that they &quot;give their help in fostering parish activity.&quot; Canon 536 does not mention the threefold task of the pastoral council – the task of investigating, reflecting, and reaching conclusions – but canon 511 does (in a reference to diocesan pastoral councils).

Four other Vatican documents define the &quot;pastoral&quot; councils in terms of this threefold task (Paul VI, &quot;Ecclesiae Sanctae I,&quot; no. 16; the 1971 Synod of Bishops&#x27; &quot;The Ministerial Priesthood,&quot; art 2, II, section 3; the 1973 &quot;Directory on the Pastoral Ministry of Bishops,&quot; no. 204; and the 1973 &quot;Circular Letter on &#x27;Pastoral Councils&#x27;&quot; by the Sacred Congregation for the Clergy, no 9). Those who read canon 536 without referring to these other Vatican documents that speak of the &quot;pastoral&quot; council may not realize that investigating, pondering, and reaching conclusions is precisely what defines the pastoral council.

=== Confusion with &quot;pastoral&quot; councils ===
Parish councils are sometimes mistakenly distinguished from parish pastoral councils, as if the two were separate parish entities. The first parish councils were, properly speaking, &quot;apostolate&quot; councils of the type recommended in the Decree on Laity, par. 26. When the Code of Canon Law was revised, it did not refer to apostolate councils, but called for pastoral councils.

Those who do not know about the development of the &quot;pastoral&quot; council idea in the Vatican documents of 1971, 1973, and 1984 may mistakenly believe that the &quot;parish&quot; councils that emerged immediately after Vatican II are separate from pastoral councils. They may wrongly suppose that &quot;parish&quot; councils are bureaucratically structured decision-making bodies, independent of the pastor, that oversee such parish matters as the annual plan, schedule and budget, capital improvements, and the like. But councils do not make decisions independently of the pastor and have a consultative vote only.

<text>Terezín (; ) is a town in Litoměřice District in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,900 inhabitants. It is a former military fortress composed of the citadel and adjacent walled garrison town. The town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation. Terezín is most infamously the location of the Nazis&#x27; Theresienstadt Ghetto.

==Administrative division==
Terezín consists of four municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Terezín (1,875)
*České Kopisty (551)
*Nové Kopisty (397)
*Počaply (139)
==Etymology==
The fortress town was named after Empress Maria Theresa ().

==Geography==

Terezín is located about south of Litoměřice and southeast of Ústí nad Labem. It lies in a flat landscape of the Lower Ohře Table. It is situated on both banks of the Ohře River, near its confluence with the Elbe. The Elbe forms the northern municipal border.

==History==

On 10 January 1780, Habsburg Emperor Joseph II ordered the erection of the fortress, named after his mother Empress Maria Theresa. In the times of Austria–Prussia rivalry, it was meant to secure the bridges across the Ohře and Elbe rivers against Prussian troops invading the Bohemian lands from neighbouring Saxony. Simultaneously, Josefov Fortress () was erected near Jaroměř as a protection against Prussian attacks.

The construction of Theresienstadt started at the westernmost cavalier on 10 October 1780 and lasted ten years. During the construction, in 1782, Theresienstadt became a free royal town. The fortress consisted of a citadel, the &quot;Small Fortress&quot;, to the east of the Ohře, and a walled town, the &quot;Main Fortress&quot;, to the west. The total area of the fortress was . In peacetime it held 5,655 soldiers, and in wartime around 11,000 soldiers could be placed here. Trenches and low-lying areas around the fortress could be flooded for defensive purposes. Garrison church in the Main Fortress was designed by Heinrich Hatzinger, Julius D&#x27;Andreis and Franz Joseph Fohmann.

The fortress was never under direct siege. During the Austro-Prussian War, on 28 July 1866, part of the garrison attacked and destroyed an important railway bridge near Neratovice (rail line Turnov–Kralupy nad Vltavou) that was shortly before repaired by the Prussians. This attack occurred two days after Austria and Prussia had agreed to make peace, but the Theresienstadt garrison was ignorant of the news.

During the second half of the 19th century, the fortress was also used as a prison. During World War I, the fortress was used as a political prison camp. Soldiers and civilians who showed opposition to the war were imprisoned here.

With the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918, the town became part of the newly-formed state of Czechoslovakia. After the Munich Agreement of 1938, Nazi Germany annexed the town with the rest of the Sudetenland.

===World War II===

After the Munich Agreement in September 1938 and following the occupation of the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, with the existing prisons gradually filled up as a result of the Nazi terror, the Prague Gestapo Police prison was set up in the Small Fortress in 1940. The first inmates arrived on 14 June 1940. By the end of the war 32,000 prisoners of whom 5,000 were women passed through the Small Fortress. These were primarily Czechs, later other nationals, for instance citizens of the former Soviet Union, Poles, Germans, and Yugoslavs. Most of the prisoners were arrested for various acts of resistance to the Nazi regime; among them were the family members and supporters of the assassins of Reinhard Heydrich. Many prisoners were later sent to concentration camps such as Mauthausen. The Jewish Ghetto was created in 1941.

By 1940, Germany assigned the Gestapo to adapt Terezín, better known by the German name Theresienstadt, as a ghetto and concentration camp. Considerable work was done in the next two years to adapt the complex for the dense overcrowding that inmates would be subjected to. It held primarily Jews from Czechoslovakia, as well as tens of thousands of Jews deported chiefly from Germany and Austria, as well as hundreds from the Netherlands and Denmark. More than 150,000 Jews were sent there, including 15,000 children.

Although it was not an extermination camp, about 33,000 died in the ghetto. This was mostly due to the appalling conditions arising out of extreme population density, malnutrition and disease. About 88,000 inhabitants were deported to Auschwitz and the other extermination camps. As late as the end of 1944, the Germans were still deporting Jews to the death camps. At the end of the war, there were 17,247 survivors of Theresienstadt (including some who had survived the death camps).

Part of the fortification (Small Fortress) served as the largest Gestapo prison in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. It was on the other side of the river from the ghetto and operated separately. Around 90,000 people went through it, and 2,600 died there.

The complex was taken over for operation by the International Red Cross on 2 May 1945, with the Commander and SS guards fleeing within the next two days. Some were later captured. The camp and prison were liberated on 9 May 1945 by the Soviet Army.

===After World War II===
After the German surrender, the small fortress was used as an internment camp for ethnic Germans. In May 1945 the camp shifted under the control of the Czech Ministry for Domestic Affairs. From then on the inmates were gradually transferred to Germany and Terezín was increasingly used as a hub for the forced migration of Germans from the Czech lands into Germany proper. War criminals were temporarily imprisoned in Terezín, but they made up only a small part of the interned. On 1 January 1948 the camp was officially closed, but the last German prisoners were released in February. At least 548 people died in the camp during the years 1945–1948 due to poor living conditions, malnutrition and infectious diseases, but also as a result of the violence of the guards.

===Modern history===

After the related war uses, the government retained a military garrison until 1996.

The town was struck by the 2002 European floods during which the crematorium was damaged. According to the Fund, a long-term conservation plan was conceived, which includes further repairs, documentation, and archaeological research.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

Terezín is mainly dependent on tourism. Terezín Memorial was the most visited tourist destination of the Ústí nad Labem Region and the most visited memorial place in the country in 2023 with more than 281 thousand visitors.

==Transport==
The I/15 road from Most to Litoměřice passes next to the town.

==Sights==

===Terezín Fortress===
Terezín Fortress is one of the most visited memorial sites in Central Europe. In 2002, the fortress, which was in a deteriorated condition, was listed in the 2002 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. The organization called for a comprehensive conservation plan, while providing funding for emergency repairs from American Express. A conservation plan was eventually developed in cooperation with national authorities.

<text>Ahrem was a village in Germany near Cologne. Ahrem is now part of the town Erftstadt. Geographical location , population 1,103 (2003).

The first written documentation about Ahrem was in 1256, when the archbishop of Cologne mentions &quot;Ainhem&quot;. However the name of the village points to roots in the time of the Franks; it means &quot;village of Arn (or Arno)&quot;. This dating is supported by a cemetery which was dated to the 6th century.

Ahrem belonged to the clerical state of Cologne, in the &quot;Amt Lechenich&quot;. Originally it was a few separated farm buildings, but during the centuries grew a core settlement around the main street and the small brook &quot;Lechenicher Mühlengraben&quot;. The village remained small - in 1801 it had just 215 citizens.

During the communal reform of 1968 the village was incorporated into the new city of Erftstadt.

<text>A seismic hazard is the probability that an earthquake will occur in a given geographic area, within a given window of time, and with ground motion intensity exceeding a given threshold. With a hazard thus estimated, risk can be assessed and included in such areas as building codes for standard buildings, designing larger buildings and infrastructure projects, land use planning and determining insurance rates. The seismic hazard studies also may generate two standard measures of anticipated ground motion, both confusingly abbreviated MCE; the simpler probabilistic Maximum Considered Earthquake (or Event ), used in standard building codes, and the more detailed and deterministic Maximum Credible Earthquake incorporated in the design of larger buildings and civil infrastructure like dams or bridges. It is important to clarify which MCE is being discussed.

Calculations for determining seismic hazard were first formulated by C. Allin Cornell in 1968 and, depending on their level of importance and use, can be quite complex. 
The regional geology and seismology setting is first examined for sources and patterns of earthquake occurrence, both in depth and at the surface from seismometer records; secondly, the impacts from these sources are assessed relative to local geologic rock and soil types, slope angle and groundwater conditions. Zones of similar potential earthquake shaking are thus determined and drawn on maps. The well known San Andreas Fault is illustrated as a long narrow elliptical zone of greater potential motion, like many areas along continental margins associated with the Pacific Ring of Fire. Zones of higher seismicity in the continental interior may be the site for intraplate earthquakes) and tend to be drawn as broad areas, based on historic records, like the 1812 New Madrid earthquake, since specific causative faults are generally not identified as earthquake sources.

Each zone is given properties associated with source potential: how many earthquakes per year, the maximum size of earthquakes (maximum magnitude), etc. Finally, the calculations require formulae that give the required hazard indicators for a given earthquake size and distance. For example, some districts prefer to use peak acceleration, others use peak velocity, and more sophisticated uses require response spectral ordinates.

The computer program then integrates over all the zones and produces probability curves for the key ground motion parameter. The final result gives a &#x27;chance&#x27; of exceeding a given value over a specified amount of time. Standard building codes for homeowners might be concerned with a 1 in 500 years chance, while nuclear plants look at the 10,000 year time frame. A longer-term seismic history can be obtained through paleoseismology. The results may be in the form of a ground response spectrum for use in seismic analysis.

More elaborate variations on the theme also look at the soil conditions. Higher ground motions are likely to be experienced on a soft swamp compared to a hard rock site. The standard seismic hazard calculations become adjusted upwards when postulating characteristic earthquakes. Areas with high ground motion due to soil conditions are also often subject to soil failure due to liquefaction. Soil failure can also occur due to earthquake-induced landslides in steep terrain. Large area landsliding can also occur on rather gentle slopes as was seen in the Good Friday earthquake in Anchorage, Alaska, March 28, 1964.

==MCEs==
In a normal seismic hazard analyses intended for the public, that of a &quot;maximum considered earthquake&quot;, or &quot;maximum considered event&quot; (MCE) for a specific area, is an earthquake that is expected to occur once in approximately 2,500 years; that is, it has a 2-percent probability of being exceeded in 50 years. The term is used specifically for general building codes, which people commonly occupy; building codes in many localities will require non-essential buildings to be designed for &quot;collapse prevention&quot; in an MCE, so that the building remains standing – allowing for safety and escape of occupants – rather than full structural survival of the building.

A far more detailed and stringent MCE stands for &quot;maximum credible earthquake&quot;, which is used in designing for skyscrapers and larger civil infrastructure, like dams, where structural failure could lead to other catastrophic consequences. These MCEs might require determining more than one specific earthquake event, depending on the variety of structures included.

==US seismic hazard maps==

Some maps released by the USGS are shown with peak ground acceleration with a 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, measured in Metre per second squared. For parts of the US, the National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project in 2008 resulted in seismic hazard maps showing peak acceleration (as a percentage of gravity) with a 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years.

Temblor, a company founded in 2014, offers a seismic hazard rank for all of the conterminous US. This service is free and ad-free for the public. The hazard rank &quot;is made for the likelihood of experiencing strong shaking (0.4g peak ground acceleration) in 30 years, based on the 2014 USGS NSHMP hazard model.&quot;

==Global seismic hazard maps==

Global seismic hazard maps exist too, which similarly present the level of certain ground motions that have a 10% probability of exceedance (or a 90% chance of non-exceedance) during a 50-year time span (that corresponds to a return period of 475 years).

<text>The Erft () is a river in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It flows through the foothills of the Eifel, and joins the Lower Rhine (left tributary). Its origin is near Nettersheim, and its mouth in Neuss-Grimlinghausen south of the Josef Cardinal Frings Bridge. The river is long, which is significantly shorter than it was originally. Due to the open-pit mining of lignite in the &quot;Hambacher Loch&quot;, the flow of the river had to be changed.

The Erft gave its name to the town of Erftstadt, through which it flows, as well as to the Rhein-Erft district. It also flows through the towns of Bad Münstereifel, Euskirchen, Bergheim, Bedburg and Grevenbroich.

<text>Seismic risk or earthquake risk is the potential impact on the built environment and on people&#x27;s well-being due to future earthquakes. Seismic risk has been defined, for most management purposes, as the potential economic, social and environmental consequences of hazardous events that may occur in a specified period of time. A building located in a region of high seismic hazard is at lower risk if it is built to sound seismic engineering principles. On the other hand, a building located in a region with a history of minor seismicity, in a brick building located on fill subject to liquefaction can be as high or higher risk.

A special subset is urban seismic risk which looks at the specific issues of cities. Risk determination and emergency response can also be determined through the use of an earthquake scenario.

==Determination of seismic risk==

The determination of seismic risk is the foundation for risk mitigation decision-making, a key step in risk management. Large corporations and other enterprises (e.g., local governments) analyze their &#x27;portfolio&#x27; of properties, to determine how to best allocate limited funds for structural strengthening of buildings, or other risk reduction measures such as emergency planning. In calculating the risk of each facility in the &#x27;portfolio&#x27;, potential life safety and economic losses due not only to structural damage, but also to equipment, contents and business interruption are considered. Public agencies (local, state governments and federal agencies) similarly analyze their portfolios. The interconnections of infrastructures such as water, road and highway, and electric power systems are also considered. Insurance companies routinely employ estimates of seismic risk in their operations to determine appropriate insurance rates, monitor over-accumulation of policies in a small area, and purchase reinsurance. A simplified method of calculating seismic risk for a given city, involves the use of a street survey. If you know the level of seismic hazard, the damage generally follows established patterns.

Seismic risk is often determined using a seismic modeling computer programs which uses the seismic hazard inputs and combines them with the known susceptibilities of structures and facilities, such as buildings, bridges, electrical power switching stations, etc. The result gives probabilities for economic damage or casualties, for example the HAZUS computer program. While the results can be used as a general measure of seismic risk for types of buildings, the actual seismic risk for any individual building may vary considerably and will depend upon its exact configuration and condition. Acquiring and analyzing the specific data for an individual building or facility is one of the most expensive and daunting aspects of seismic risk estimation. Progress is made if one can calculate the &#x27;fragility&#x27; or seismic capacity of the components within a structure.

In 1999, ASTM produced guidelines for reporting seismic loss estimates on commercial properties, commonly known as Probable Maximum Loss or PML reviews. These guidelines specify the scope of work, qualifications of the reviewer, and proper nomenclature for reporting loss estimates.

==Reduction of seismic risk==
Seismic risk can be reduced by active programs that improve emergency response, and improve basic infrastructure. The concepts of earthquake preparedness can help plan for emergencies arising from an earthquake. Building codes are intended to help to manage seismic risk and are updated as more is learned about the effects of seismic ground motion on buildings. This type of active improvement of mitigation of damage from earthquakes is known as seismic retrofit. However, the changes generally do not immediately improve seismic risk in a community since existing buildings are rarely required to be upgraded to meet the revisions.

<doc id="230536" wikidata="Q2355815" url="?curid=230536" title="Good Burger">
<text>Good Burger is a 1997 American teen comedy film directed by Brian Robbins, written by Dan Schneider with Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert, and starring Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchell, and Abe Vigoda. The film is a spin-off of the &quot;Good Burger&quot; comedy sketch from the Nickelodeon variety series &quot;All That&quot;, with Mitchell reprising his role as Ed. The story follows Dexter Reed, a high school student who takes a job at a fast-food restaurant called Good Burger to pay off the damages he made to his teacher&#x27;s car as he and Ed, his dimwitted co-worker, stumble upon an evil plot by a rival fast-food restaurant.

The film was produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Tollin/Robbins Productions, and was filmed from March to April 1997. It was released worldwide on July 25 of the same year by Paramount Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $23.7 million. In the years after its release, the film received a cult following.

A sequel titled &quot;Good Burger 2&quot; was released on November 22, 2023, on Paramount+.

==Plot==
On the first day of summer, slacker high school student Dexter Reed takes his mother&#x27;s car on a joyride while she is away on a business trip but is indirectly involved in a car crash with his school teacher, Mr. Wheat. With no driver&#x27;s license or car insurance, Dexter is in danger of going to jail, but Mr. Wheat agrees to let him pay for the damage in exchange for not calling the police on him. With the damage estimated at $1,900 (which later becomes $2,500), Dexter decides to take a summer job to pay for the expenses.

After being fired from the new and soon-to-open Mondo Burger restaurant for clashing with the owner and manager Kurt Bozwell, he ends up working for Good Burger instead. There, he meets and reluctantly befriends the dimwitted but well-meaning cashier Ed alongside its other employees. While both are working together, Dexter realizes that Ed caused his car crash, but eventually forgives him.

Mondo Burger becomes an immediate success with its large burgers, hurting Good Burger&#x27;s business. Dexter discovers that Ed makes his sauce for lunch and suggests adding it to the burgers, which saves Good Burger and vastly increases its sales. Dexter exploits Ed&#x27;s gullibility to extort money from him so that he can pay off his debt sooner, having him sign a contract that gives Dexter 80% of the bonus he receives for his sauce. After failing to entice Ed with a higher hourly wage at Mondo Burger, Kurt, who wants the secret sauce for his restaurant, sends an employee named Roxanne to seduce him into revealing the recipe. However, while on a double date with Dexter and co-worker Monique, Ed accidentally and clumsily injures her repeatedly, and she quits her job.

The next day, Monique finds Dexter&#x27;s contract and scolds him for taking advantage of Ed, causing Dexter to feel remorseful. Dexter tries to apologize to Ed, but before he can do so, he and Ed discover a stray dog rejecting a discarded Mondo Burger for a Good Burger. A suspicious Ed and Dexter infiltrate Mondo Burger&#x27;s kitchen in disguise and discover that their burgers are artificially enhanced with Triampathol, an illegal food chemical. Kurt discovers them and has them committed to the Demented Hills Asylum to prevent them from sharing their discovery. Afterward, Kurt and his henchmen break into Good Burger, find Ed&#x27;s secret sauce, and taint it with a synthetic toxin called shark poison. Otis, an elderly employee who was sleeping on the premises, catches them and attempts to call the police, but Kurt sends him to Demented Hills as well. After Otis informs Ed and Dexter about Kurt&#x27;s scheme, they escape from Demented Hills and commandeer an ice cream truck to head back to Good Burger. Two Demented Hills workers chase after them in a truck, but Ed pelts ice cream at their windshield, eventually obstructing their view and causing them to crash. Ed arrives at Good Burger just in time to prevent an elderly woman from eating the poisoned sauce.

Ed and Dexter return to Mondo Burger to expose their crimes to the police. While Dexter creates a distraction, Ed takes multiple cans of Triampathol and pours them into the meat grinder. As Kurt corners Dexter on the roof, Ed suddenly arrives with an empty can just before Mondo Burger collapses, as the burgers start exploding due to the excessive Triampathol, and in the process, a large artificial burger falls from the roof and smashes Mr. Wheat&#x27;s newly-repaired car. In the aftermath, Mondo Burger is shut down and Kurt is arrested for poisoning Good Burger&#x27;s sauce and using illegal Triampathol. After giving Mr. Wheat a down payment, Dexter apologizes to Ed for taking advantage of him and tears up the contract, telling him that he gets to keep all the profits. Ed and Dexter return to Good Burger, where their coworkers hail them as heroes.

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Good Burger&quot; was released on July 25, 1997, by Paramount Pictures. Theatrical screenings were preempted by an episode of Nickelodeon&#x27;s series &quot;Action League Now!&quot; titled &quot;Rock-a-Big Baby&quot;. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $7.1 million, finishing #5 at the US box office. It went on to gross $23.7 million worldwide. It was released in the United Kingdom on February 13, 1998, where it reached #14.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 33% based on 45 reviews and an average rating of 4.3/10. The consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Good Burger&quot; might please hardcore fans of the 1990s Nickelodeon TV series that launched leads Kenan and Kel to stardom, but for all others, it will likely prove a comedy that is neither satisfyingly rare nor well done.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 41 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Lisa Alspector of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote, &quot;The perceived notion that kids want their movies fast and furious is barely in evidenced in this 1997 comedy, a laboriously slow suburban adventure in which a teenager&#x27;s summer of leisure slips through his fingers when he has to get a job—an experience that proves almost life-threatening because of the cutthroat competition between two burger joints.&quot; Andy Seiler of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film two stars out of four, saying that, &quot;&quot;Good Burger&quot; is not very well done, but it does have energy.&quot;

Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The meat of the piece is definitely FDA cinematically approved, and perfect if you like this brand of entertainment with the works.&quot; Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs down on the July 26, 1997 episode of their program. Gene Siskel disliked the film more than Roger Ebert did, calling it a &quot;stupid kids comedy&quot;. In his other review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, writing &quot;It didn&#x27;t do much for me, but I am prepared to predict that its target audience will have a good time.&quot;

Retrospective reviews well after the initial release have described its continued popularity; Nathan Rabin said that the film &quot;obviously connected with a lot of children at the time of the film&#x27;s release and holds up surprisingly well 18 years later.&quot; Courtney Eckerle said, &quot;The 90s generation will never forget [this deliciously terrible movie]&quot; and Tara Aquino of &quot;Mental Floss&quot; called it &quot;a silly cult hit that&#x27;s indelibly a part of Generation Y.&quot;

==Other media==
===Home media===
Paramount Home Video released the film on VHS on February 17, 1998, with the cassettes specially made of orange plastic, and on DVD on May 27, 2003 with a lack of bonus features.

The film was released on Blu-ray on February 16, 2021. On July 19, 2022, a limited edition Blu-ray steelbook of the film was released to commemorate its 25th anniversary. Like the original DVD and first edition Blu-ray, the 25th anniversary lacks any special features except for the original &quot;Good Burger&quot; sketch from &quot;All That&quot;.

<text>A camel train, caravan, or camel string is a series of camels carrying passengers and goods on a regular or semi-regular service between points. Despite rarely travelling faster than human walking speed, for centuries camels&#x27; ability to withstand harsh conditions made them ideal for communication and trade in the desert areas of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Camel trains were also used sparingly elsewhere around the globe. Since the early 20th century they have been largely replaced by motorized vehicles or air traffic.

==Africa, Asia and the Middle East==
By far the greatest use of camel trains occurs between North and West Africa by the Tuareg, Shuwa and Hassaniyya, as well as by culturally-affiliated groups like the Toubou, Hausa and Songhay. These camel trains conduct trade in and around the Sahara Desert and Sahel. Trains travel as far south as central Nigeria and northern Cameroon in the west, and northern Kenya in the east of the continent. In antiquity, the Arabian Peninsula was an important route for the trade with India and Abyssinia. 

Camel trains have also long been used in portions of trans-Asian trade, including the Silk Road. As late as the early twentieth century, camel caravans played an important role connecting the Beijing/Shanxi region of eastern China with Mongolian centers (Urga, Uliastai, Kobdo) and Xinjiang. The routes went across Inner and Outer Mongolia. According to Owen Lattimore, who spent five months in 1926 crossing the northern edge of China (from Hohhot to Gucheng, via Inner Mongolia) with a camel caravan, demand for caravan trade was only increased by the arrival of foreign steamships into Chinese ports and the construction of the first railways in eastern China, as they improved access to the world market for such products of western China as wool.

==Australia==

In the English-speaking world the term &quot;camel train&quot; often applies to Australia, notably the service that once connected a railhead at Oodnadatta in South Australia to Alice Springs in the center of the continent. The service ended when the Central Australia Railway line was extended to Alice Springs in 1929; that train is called &quot;The Ghan&quot;, a shortened version of &quot;Afghan Express&quot;, and its logo is camel and rider, in honor of the &quot;Afghan cameleers&quot; who pioneered the route.

==North America==
;United States

The history of camel trains in the United States consists mainly of an experiment by the United States Army. On April 29, 1856, thirty-three camels and five drivers arrived at Indianola, Texas. While camels were suited to the job of transport in the American Southwest, the experiment failed. Their stubbornness and aggressiveness made them unpopular among soldiers, and they frightened horses. Many of the camels were sold to private owners, others escaped into the desert. These feral camels continued to be sighted through the early 20th century, with the last reported sighting in 1941 near Douglas, Texas.

;British Columbia, Canada

Camels were used from 1862 to 1863 in British Columbia, Canada during the Cariboo Gold Rush.

==Camel caravan organization==
While organization of camel caravans varied over time and the territory traversed, Owen Lattimore&#x27;s account of caravan life in northern China in the 1920s gives a good idea of what camel transport is like. In his &quot;Desert Road to Turkestan&quot; he describes mostly camel caravans run by Han Chinese and Hui firms from eastern China (Hohhot, Baotou) or Xinjiang (Qitai (then called Gucheng), Barkol), plying the routes connecting those two regions through the Gobi Desert by way of Inner (or, before Mongolia&#x27;s independence, Outer) Mongolia. Before Outer Mongolia&#x27;s effective independence of China (circa 1920) the same firms also ran caravans into Urga, Uliassutai, and other centers of Outer Mongolia, and to the Russian border at Kyakhta, but with the creation of an international border, those routes came into decline. Less important caravan routes served various other areas of northern China, such as most centers in today&#x27;s Gansu, Ningxia, and northern Qinghai. Some of the oldest Hohhot-based caravan firms had a history dating to the early Qing dynasty.

===Camels===
Caravans originating from both ends of the Hohhot-Gucheng route were composed of two-humped Bactrian camels, suitable for the climate on the area, although very occasionally one could see single-humped dromedaries brought to this route by Uighur (&quot;Turki&quot;, in Lattimore&#x27;s parlance) caravan people from Hami A caravan would be normally composed of a number of files (, &quot;lian&quot;), of up to 18 camels each. Each of the rank-and-file caravan men, known as the &quot;camel-pullers&quot; (, &quot;la luotuo-de&quot;), was in charge of one such file. On the march, the camel-puller&#x27;s job was to lead the first camel of his file by a rope tied to a peg attached to its nose, each of the other camels of the file being led by means of similar rope by the camel in front of it. Two files (&quot;lian&quot;) formed a &quot;ba&quot;, and the camel-pullers of the two files would help each other when loading cargo on the camels at the beginning of each day&#x27;s march or unloading it when halted. To do their job properly camel-pullers had to be experts on camels: as Lattimore comments, &quot;because there is no good doctoring known for him [a camel] when he is sick, they must learn how to keep him well.&quot; Taking care of camels&#x27; health included the ability to find the best available grazing for them and keeping them away from poisonous plants; knowledge of when one should not allow a camel to drink too much water; how to park camels for the night, allowing them to obtain the best possible shelter from wind-blown snow in winter; how to properly distribute the load to prevent it from hurting the animal; and how to treat minor injuries of the camels, such as blisters or pack-sores.

The loading of camels was described by Mildred Cable and Francesca French in their book &quot;Through Jade Gate and Central Asia&quot; (1927): «In the loading of a camel its grumblings commence as the first bale is placed on its back, and continue uninterruptedly until the load is equal to its strength, but as soon as it shows signs of being in excess, the grumbling ceases suddenly, and then the driver says: &quot;Enough! put no more on this beast!&quot;»

===Caravan people ===

A caravan could consist of 150 or so camels (8 or more files), with a camel-puller for each file. Besides the camel-pullers the caravan would also include a &quot;xiansheng&quot; (先生, literally, &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Mister&quot;) (typically, an older man with a long experience as a camel-puller, now playing the role of a general manager), one or two cooks, and the caravan master, whose authority over the caravan and its people was as absolute as that of a captain on a ship. If the owner of the caravan did not travel with the caravan himself, he would send along a supercargo — the person who will take care of the disposal of the freight upon arrival, but had no authority during the journey. The caravan could carry a number of paying passengers as well, who would alternate between riding on top of a camel load and walking.

Camel-pullers&#x27; salary was quite low (around 2 silver taels a month in 1926, which would not be enough even for shoes and clothing he wore out while walking with his camels), although they were also fed and provided with tent space at the caravan owner&#x27;s expense. Those people worked not so much for the wages as for the benefit of carrying some cargo—half of a camel load, or a full load—of their own on the caravan&#x27;s camels; when successfully sold at the destination, it would bring a handy profit. Even more importantly, if a camel-puller could afford to buy a camel or a few of his own, he was allowed to include them into his file, and to collect the carriage-money for the cargo (assigned by the caravan owner) that they would carry. Once the camel-puller got rich enough to own close to a full file of 18 camels, he could join the caravan not as an employee but as a kind of a partner—now instead of earning wages he would be paying money (around 20 taels per round-trip in 1926) to the owner of (the rest of) the caravan for the benefit of joining the caravan, sharing in the food, etc.

===Diet===
The caravan people&#x27;s food was mostly based around oat and millet flour, with some animal fat. A sheep would be bought from the Mongols and slaughtered every now and then, and tea was the usual daily drink; as fresh vegetables were scarce, scurvy was a danger. Besides the paid cargo and the food and gear for the men, the camels would also carry a fair amount of fodder for themselves (typically, dried peas when going west, and barley when going east, those being the cheapest types of camel feed in Hohhot and Gucheng, respectively). It was estimated that, when leaving its point of origin, for every 100 loads of merchandise the caravan would carry around 30 loads of fodder. When that was not enough (especially in winter) more fodder could be bought (very expensively) from dealers who would come to the caravan route&#x27;s popular stopping places from the populated areas of Gansu or Ningxia to the south.

===Cargo===
Typical cargo carried by the caravans were commodities such as wool, cotton fabrics, or tea, as well as miscellaneous manufactured goods for sale in Xinjiang and Mongolia. Opium was carried as well, typically by smaller, surreptitious, caravans, usually in winter (since in the hot weather opium would be too easily detected by the smell). More exotic loads could include jade from Khotan, elk antlers prized in Chinese medicine, or even dead bodies of the Shanxi caravan men and traders, who happened to die while in Xinjiang. In the latter case, the bodies had been first &quot;temporarily&quot; buried in Gucheng in light-weight coffins, and when, after three or so years in the grave the flesh had been mostly &quot;consumed away&quot;, the merchant guild sent the bodies to the east by a special caravan. Due to the special nature of the load, higher freight rate was charged for such &quot;dead passengers&quot;. Camels have been historically used to traffic illicit drugs among their legal trade goods. With camel meat being illegal in some places, Camels themselves are smuggled. In India, ritual sacrifice and common slaughter has fueled camel smuggling.

===Speed===
According to Lattimore&#x27;s diary, caravan travel in Inner Mongolia did not always follow a regular schedule. Caravans traveled or camped at any time of day or night, depending on weather, local conditions, and the need for rest. Since the caravan traveled at the walking speed of the men, the distance made in a day (a &quot;stage&quot;) was usually between , depending on road and weather conditions, and distances between water sources. On occasions several days were spent in a camp without going forward, due to bad weather. A one-way trip from Hohhot to Gucheng ( by Lattimore&#x27;s reckoning) could take anything from three to eight months.

Smaller caravans owned by Mongols of the Alashan (the westernmost Inner Mongolia) and manned by Han Chinese from Zhenfan, were able to make longer marches (and, thus, cover longer distances faster) than the typical Han Chinese or Hui caravans, because the Mongols were able to always use &quot;fresh&quot; camels (picked from their large herd for just a single journey), every man was provided with a camel to ride, and loads were much lighter than in the &quot;standard&quot; caravans (rarely exceeding . These caravans would typically travel by day, from sunrise to sunset. Such a camel train is described in the accounts of the journey made by Peter Fleming and Ella Maillart in the Gobi Desert in the mid-1930s.

===Logistics===
Inns called caravanserai were spread along the route of a long caravan journey. These roadside inns specialized in catering to travelers along established trade routes, such as the Silk Road and the Royal Road. Because such long trade routes often passed through inhospitable desert regions, journeys would be impossible to complete successfully and profitably without caravanserai to provide necessary supplies and assistance to merchants and travelers. 

It was necessary for camels to spend at least two months between long journeys to recuperate, and the best time for that recuperation was in June–July, when camels shed their hair and the grazing is best. Therefore, the best practice was for a caravan to leave Hohhot in August, just after the grazing season; upon reaching Gucheng, weaker camels could stay there until the next summer by grazing whatever vegetation is available in winter, while the stronger ones, after a few weeks of recovery on a grain diet (grain being cheaper in Xinjiang than in eastern China), would be sent back in late winter/early spring, taking along plenty of grain for fodder, and returning to Hohhot before the next grazing season. Vice versa, one could leave Hohhot in the spring, spend the summer grazing season in Xinjiang, and come back in the late fall of the same year. Either way, it would be possible for the caravan people and their best camels to make a full round trip within a year. However, such perfect scheduling was not always possible, and it was often the case that a caravan sent out from Hohhot in August would end up staying on the other end of the route until and through the next grazing season, coming back to Hohhot about a year and a half after its departure.
===Loss of camels; camel hair trade===
On almost every journey quite a few camels in each caravan would be lost. On a particularly exhausting section of the trip, an animal already worn out by many weeks of walking, or accidentally poisoned by eating a poisonous plant, would kneel down and not rise anymore. Since killing a camel was considered bad karma by the caravan people, the hopeless animal—whose death, if it was owned by an individual camel-puller, would be a huge material loss for its owner—was simply left behind to die, &quot;thrown on the Gobi&quot; as the camel men would say.

Since camels moult in the summer, camel owners received additional income from collecting several pounds of hair their animals dropped during the summer grazing (and shedding season); in northern China, the camel hair trade started around the 1880s. Later, caravan men learned the art of knitting and crocheting from the defeated White Russians (in exile in Xinjiang after the Russian Civil War) and the items they had made were transported to eastern China by camel caravan. Although the hair shed by the camels or picked from them was of course considered the property of the camel owners, caravan workers were entitled to make use of some hair for making knitwear for themselves (mostly socks) or for sale. Lattimore in 1926 observed camel-pullers &quot;knitting on the march; if they ran out of yarn, they would reach back to the first camel of the file they were leading, pluck a handful of hair from the neck, and roll it in their palms into the beginning of a length of yarn; a weight was attached to this, and given a twist to start it spinning, and the man went on feeding wool into the thread until he had spun enough yarn to continue his knitting&quot;.
== Cultural associations==
&quot;In the Desert&quot; (&quot;Верблюды&quot;, literally &#x27;Camels&#x27;) is a &quot;traditional Russian&quot; song, performed by Donald Swann. He provides an English-language translation after every line. The song is extremely repetitive (&quot;Another camel is approaching&quot;), rendering the translation largely redundant, &quot;a whole caravan of camels is approaching&quot;.

Fritz Mühlenweg wrote a book called &quot;In geheimer Mission durch die Wüste Gobi&quot; (part one in English &quot;Big Tiger and Compass Mountain&quot;), published in 1950. It was later shortened and translated into English under the title &quot;Big Tiger and Christian&quot;; it concerns the adventures of two boys who cross the Gobi Desert.

<text>Appreciative inquiry (AI) is a model that seeks to engage stakeholders in self-determined change. According to Gervase Bushe, professor of leadership and organization development at the Beedie School of Business and a researcher on the topic, &quot;AI revolutionized the field of organization development and was a precursor to the rise of positive organization studies and the strengths based movement in American management.&quot; It was developed at Case Western Reserve University&#x27;s department of organizational behavior, starting with a 1987 article by David Cooperrider and Suresh Srivastva. They felt that the overuse of problem solving hampered any kind of social improvement, and what was needed were new methods of inquiry that would help generate new ideas and models for how to organize.

== History ==
Cooperrider and Srivastva took a social constructionist approach, arguing that organizations are created, maintained and changed by conversations, and claiming that methods of organizing were only limited by people&#x27;s imaginations and the agreements among them.

In 2001, Cooperrider and Diana Whitney published an article outlining the five principles of AI.

In 1996, Cooperrider, Whitney and several of their colleagues became centrally involved using AI to mid-wife the creation of the United Religions Initiative, a global organization dedicated to promoting grassroots interfaith cooperation for peace, justice and healing. This early partnership between URI and AI is chronicled in &quot;Birth of a Global Community: Appreciative Inquiry in Action&quot; by Charles Gibbs and Sally Mahé. AI was also used in the first (1999) and subsequent meetings of business leaders that created the UN Global Compact. In another of the early applications, Cooperrider and Whitney taught AI to employees of GTE (now part of Verizon) resulting in improvements in employees&#x27; support for GTE&#x27;s business direction and as a part of continuous process improvement generated both improvements in revenue collection and cost savings earning GTE an Association for Talent Development award for the best organizational change program in the US in 1997.

On May 8, 2010, Suresh Srivastva died.

Bushe published a 2011 review of the model, including its processes, critiques, and evidence. He also published a history of the model in 2012.

== Basis and principles ==

According to Bushe, AI &quot;advocates collective inquiry into the best of what is, in order to imagine what could be, followed by collective design of a desired future state that is compelling and thus, does not require the use of incentives, coercion or persuasion for planned change to occur.&quot;

The model is based on the assumption that the questions we ask will tend to focus our attention in a particular direction, that organizations evolve in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately ask. In the mid-1980s most methods of assessing and evaluating a situation and then proposing solutions were based on a &quot;deficiency&quot; model, predominantly asking questions such as &quot;What are the problems?&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; or &quot;What needs to be fixed?&quot;. Instead of asking &quot;What&#x27;s the problem?&quot;, others couched the question in terms of &quot;challenges&quot;, which still focused on deficiency, on what needs to be fixed or solved. Appreciative inquiry was the first serious managerial method to refocus attention on what works, the positive core, and on what people really care about. Today, these ways of approaching organizational change are common.

The five principles of AI are:
# The &quot;constructionist principle&quot; proposes that what we believe to be true determines what we do, and thought and action emerge from relationships. Through the language and discourse of day to day interactions, people co-construct the organizations they inhabit. The purpose of inquiry is to stimulate new ideas, stories and images that generate new possibilities for action.
# The &quot;principle of simultaneity&quot; proposes that as we inquire into human systems we change them and the seeds of change, the things people think and talk about, what they discover and learn, are implicit in the very first questions asked. Questions are never neutral, they are fateful, and social systems move in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately discuss.
# The &quot;poetic principle&quot; proposes that organizational life is expressed in the stories people tell each other every day, and the story of the organization is constantly being co-authored. The words and topics chosen for inquiry have an impact far beyond just the words themselves. They invoke sentiments, understandings, and worlds of meaning. In all phases of the inquiry effort is put into using words that point to, enliven and inspire the best in people.
# The &quot;anticipatory principle&quot; posits that what we do today is guided by our image of the future. Human systems are forever projecting ahead of themselves a horizon of expectation that brings the future powerfully into the present as a mobilizing agent. Appreciative inquiry uses artful creation of positive imagery on a collective basis to refashion anticipatory reality.
# The &quot;positive principle&quot; proposes that momentum and sustainable change requires positive affect and social bonding. Sentiments like hope, excitement, inspiration, camaraderie and joy increase creativity, openness to new ideas and people, and cognitive flexibility. They also promote the strong connections and relationships between people, particularly between groups in conflict, required for collective inquiry and change.

Some researchers believe that excessive focus on dysfunctions can actually cause them to become worse or fail to become better. By contrast, AI argues, when all members of an organization are motivated to understand and value the most favorable features of its culture, it can make rapid improvements.

Strength-based methods are used in the creation of organizational development strategy and implementation of organizational effectiveness tactics. The &quot;appreciative&quot; mode of inquiry often relies on interviews to qualitatively understand the organization&#x27;s potential strengths by looking at an organization&#x27;s experience and its potential; the objective is to elucidate the assets and personal motivations that are its strengths.

Bushe has argued that mainstream proponents of AI focus too much attention on &quot;the positive&quot; and not enough on the transformation that AI can bring about through generating new ideas and the will to act on them. In a 2010 comparative study in a school district he found that even in cases where no change occurred participants were highly positive during the AI process. What distinguished those sites that experienced transformational changes was the creation of new ideas that gave people new ways to address old problems. He argues that for transformational change to occur, AI must address problems that concern people enough to want to change. However, AI addresses them not through problem-solving, but through generative images. Some of this is covered in a 90-minute discussion about AI, positivity and generativity by Bushe and Dr. Ron Fry of Case Western, at the 2012 World Appreciative Inquiry Conference.

== Distinguishing features ==

The following table comes from Cooperrider and Srivastva&#x27;s (1987) original article and is used to describe some of the distinctions between AI and traditional approaches to organizational development:

Appreciative inquiry attempts to use ways of asking questions and envisioning the future in order to foster positive relationships and build on the present potential of a given person, organization, or situation. The most common model, called the 4D model describes a sequence of four processes. Many have pointed out, however, that there is an initial process of DEFINE, identifying what sponsors of the inquiry want more of - what they are trying to improve or bring into existence. From that point, Appreciative Inquiry emphasizes bringing as many stakeholders, particularly those who will need to change for any change to happen, into 2-4 day meetings that follow this sequence:
#&quot;DISCOVER:&quot; Exploring the personal story each participant has of the desired outcome as its best/most meaningful/most inspiring (e.g., exceptional customer service). Learnings from those stories are shared.
#&quot;DREAM:&quot; Voicing the deepest, most meaningful aspirations each person holds and weaving them loosely together. Often using play and art to engage the less rational, more personal parts of people.
#&quot;DESIGN:&quot; Small groups self-organize around problems, outcomes, or solutions they want to work on. Prototyping is common. Time to work with feedback from others is common.
#&quot;DESTINY&quot; (or &quot;DEPLOY&quot;): There are two ways this is managed. In the hi-engagement approach, proposals are given to leaders to manage. Some time may be spent at the Summit giving leaders advice on how to proceed. In the generative approach, people are encouraged to take action on their ideas without waiting for permission. The generative approach is far more transformational.

The aim of most AI practitioners is to create aligned, committed action in organizations and communities by identifying what we collectively want and planning how to get it. AI originally described this approach as the opposite of problem-solving. Later thinking identified &quot;generativity&quot; as the differentiator. Generativity is the creation of new ideas that people want to act on, and appreciative inquiry creates more generative conversations. People use appreciative inquiry to solve problems, but they do it through generativity, not problem-solving. 

==Implementing AI==

There are a variety of approaches to implementing appreciative inquiry, including mass-mobilised interviews and a large, diverse gathering called an Appreciative Inquiry Summit. These approaches involve bringing large, diverse groups of people together to study and build upon the &quot;best&quot; in an organization or community.

== Uses ==
In Vancouver, AI is being used by the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education. The center, which was founded by the Dalai Lama and Victor Chan, is using AI to facilitate compassionate communities.

<text>Richard III is a 1995 period drama film, based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s play of the same name, directed by Richard Loncraine. The film adapts the play&#x27;s story and characters to a setting based on 1930s Great Britain, with Richard depicted as a fascist plotting to usurp the throne.

Ian McKellen portrays Richard, as well as co-writing the screenplay with Loncraine. The cast also includes Annette Bening as Queen Elizabeth, Jim Broadbent as the Duke of Buckingham, Robert Downey Jr. as Rivers, Kristin Scott Thomas as Anne Neville, Nigel Hawthorne as the Duke of Clarence, Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York, John Wood as King Edward IV and Tim McInnerny as Sir William Catesby.

The film premiered in Brazil on 20 August 1995, and was released in the United States on 29 December 1995, and in the United Kingdom on 26 April of the following year. While unsuccessful at the box office, it received critical acclaim, and won several accolades. At the 50th British Academy Film Awards, it won the awards for Best Production Design and Best Costume Design, with nominations for Best British Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor in a Leading Role. It also earned Oscar nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, and McKellen was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.

==Plot==
In a fictitious timeline of England in the late 1930s, a civil war (which occurs 450 years later than the historical event) ends with the Lancastrian King Henry and his son Prince Edward assassinated by Field Marshal Richard Gloucester of the rival faction supported by the House of York. Richard&#x27;s elder brother Edward York becomes King. Richard is determined to take the crown, and pits King Edward against his brother, George Clarence, who is imprisoned under a sentence of death. Richard deceives and marries Prince Edward&#x27;s widow Lady Anne Neville.

Queen Elizabeth intercedes on Clarence&#x27;s behalf and persuades Edward to spare his life. Richard destroys the royal pardon and commissions James Tyrrell to execute Clarence, ostensibly in compliance with Clarence&#x27;s death sentence. Richard informs Edward of Clarence&#x27;s death at a meeting with Prime Minister William Hastings, and the King dies from a stroke. As Edward&#x27;s sons are underage, Richard becomes Regent, taking the title of Lord Protector with the support of the ambitious and corrupt Henry Buckingham.

To undermine his rivals for the throne, Richard has Rivers, the Queen&#x27;s brother, assassinated and uses the sordid circumstances of his death to damage the Queen&#x27;s reputation and cast doubt on her sons&#x27; legitimacy. Hastings&#x27; reluctance to support Richard&#x27;s claim to the crown so enrages Richard that he manufactures false charges of treason against him, who is sentenced to hang. Having made an example of his only vocal opponent, Richard persuades the Lord Mayor of London and members of the House of Lords to acknowledge his claim to the throne and crown him King. Acting on the advice of Archbishop Thomas and Lord Stanley, the Lancastrian heir, Henry Richmond, flees to France.

Following his coronation Richard, now King Richard III, seeks to make his throne secure. He employs Tyrrell to murder the princes after failing to convince Buckingham to do so. Aware that Richmond intends to marry Elizabeth, he instructs Sir William Catesby to spread rumours that Lady Anne is ill and likely to die, intending to marry Elizabeth. Lady Anne is found dead sometime later from an apparent drug overdose. Impatient for the promised reward for his loyalty, Buckingham demands the Earldom of Hereford. Richard dismisses this in a high-handed manner, with the line &quot;I am not in the giving vein&quot;. Buckingham, also disturbed by the murders of the princes and Hastings, flees to meet Richmond but is later captured and killed by Tyrrell on Richard&#x27;s orders.

Richmond gathers supporters, among them Archbishop Thomas and Richard&#x27;s mother, the Duchess of York. They are joined by Air Marshal Thomas Stanley. Richmond marries Elizabeth and unites both Houses and political factions against Richard. With the army&#x27;s loyalty slipping and the legitimacy of his claims to the crown weakened, Richard prepares for the final battle against the Lancastrians, who plan an invasion and an advance on London. Richard&#x27;s remaining loyal troops, assembling in a marshalling yard, are attacked from the air, revealing Stanley&#x27;s defection to the Lancastrian cause.

The two armies meet soon after at a ruined Battersea Power Station. Richard and Richmond seek each other out but when his vehicle stalls Richard flees into the structure. Pursued by Richmond, Richard is forced to climb onto exposed metal beams high above the burning battlefield. Cornered by Richmond and refusing to surrender, Richard falls into the inferno with a maniacal grin, reflected by Richmond.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to &quot;Richard III&quot; was released on 27 February 1996.

&quot;Come Live With Me&quot; is a 1930s-style swing song, performed by Stacey Kent at the ball celebrating Edward IV&#x27;s triumph. It is an original composition by Trevor Jones with anachronistic lyrics adapted from Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Passionate Shepherd To His Love&quot;, a poem actually written a century after the events depicted in the play.

==Legacy==
One of the T-34 tanks used in the film, originally in service with the Czech army, can still be seen in London, permanently located on a plot of land in Bermondsey on the corner of Mandela Way and Page&#x27;s Walk. It is regularly repainted by graffiti artists.

Case alumni, scientists, and scholars have played significant roles in many scientific breakthroughs and discoveries. Case professor Albert A. Michelson received the Nobel Prize in Physics and became the first American to win a Nobel Prize in a science.

==History==
===Western Reserve College (1826–1882) and University (1882–1967)===
Western Reserve College, the college of the Connecticut Western Reserve, was founded in 1826 in Hudson, Ohio, as the Western Reserve College and Preparatory School. Western Reserve College, or &quot;Reserve&quot; as it was popularly called, was the first college in northern Ohio. The school was called &quot;Yale of the West&quot;; its campus, now that of the Western Reserve Academy, imitated that of Yale. It had the same motto, &quot;Lux et Veritas&quot; (Light and Truth), the same entrance standards, and nearly the same curriculum. It was different from Yale in that it was a manual labor college, in which students were required to perform manual labor, seen as psychologically beneficial.

Western Reserve College&#x27;s founders sought to instill in students an &quot;evangelical ethos&quot; and train ministers for Ohio, where there was an acute shortage of them. The college was located in Hudson because the town made the largest financial offer to help in its construction. That town, about 30 miles southeast of Cleveland, had been an antislavery center from the beginning: its founder, David Hudson, was against slavery, and founding trustee Owen Brown was a noted abolitionist who secured the location for the college. The abolitionist John Brown, who would lead the 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry, grew up in Hudson and was the son of co-founder Owen Brown. Hudson was a major stop on the Underground Railroad.

Along with Presbyterian influences of its founding, the school&#x27;s origins were strongly though briefly associated with the pre-Civil War abolitionist movement; the abolition of slavery was the dominant topic on campus in 1831. The trustees were unhappy with the situation. The college&#x27;s chaplain and Bible professor, Beriah Green, gave four sermons on the topic and then resigned, expecting that he would be fired. President Charles Backus Storrs took a leave of absence for health, and soon died. One of the two remaining professors, Elizur Wright, soon left to head the American Anti-Slavery Society.

Western Reserve was the first college west of the Appalachian Mountains to enroll (1832) and graduate (1836) an African-American student, John Sykes Fayette. Frederick Douglass gave the commencement speech in 1854.

In 1838, the Loomis Observatory was built by astronomer Elias Loomis, and today remains the second oldest observatory in the United States, and the oldest still in its original location.

In 1852, the Medical School became the second medical? school in the United States to graduate a woman, Nancy Talbot Clark. Five more women graduated over the next four years, including Emily Blackwell and Marie Zakrzewska, giving Western Reserve the distinction of graduating six of the first eight female physicians in the United States.

By 1875, Cleveland had emerged as the dominant population and business center of the region, and the city wanted a prominent higher education institution. In 1882, with funding from Amasa Stone, Western Reserve College moved to Cleveland and changed its name to Adelbert College of Western Reserve University. Adelbert was the name of Stone&#x27;s son.

===Case School of Applied Science (1880–1947) and Institute of Technology (1947–1967)===
In 1877, Leonard Case Jr. began laying the groundwork for the Case School of Applied Science by secretly donating valuable pieces of Cleveland real estate to a trust. He asked his confidential advisor, Henry Gilbert Abbey, to administer the trust and to keep it secret until after his death in 1880.

On March 29, 1880, articles of incorporation were filed for the founding of the Case School of Applied Science. Classes began on September 15, 1881. The school received its charter by the state of Ohio in 1882.

For the first four years of the school&#x27;s existence, it was located in the Case family&#x27;s home on Rockwell Street in downtown Cleveland. Classes were held in the family house, while the chemistry and physics laboratories were on the second floor of the barn. Amasa Stone&#x27;s gift to relocate Western Reserve College to Cleveland also included a provision for the purchase of land in the University Circle area, adjacent to Western Reserve University, for the Case School of Applied Science. The school relocated to University Circle in 1885.

In 1921 Albert Einstein came to the Case campus during his first visit to the United States, out of respect for the physics work performed there. Besides noting the research done in the Michelson–Morley experiment, Einstein also met with physics professor Dayton Miller to discuss his own research.

During World War II, Case School of Applied Science was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

Over time, the Case School of Applied Science expanded to encompass broader subjects, adopting the name Case Institute of Technology in 1947 to reflect the institution&#x27;s growth.

Led by polymer expert Eric Baer in 1963, the nation&#x27;s first stand-alone Polymer Science and Engineering program was founded, to eventually become the Department of Macromolecular Science and Engineering.

===Federation of two universities===
Although the trustees of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University did not formally federate their institutions until 1967, the institutions already shared buildings and staff when necessary and worked together often. One such example was seen in 1887, when Case physicist Albert Michelson and Reserve chemist Edward Morley collaborated on the famous Michelson–Morley experiment.

There had been some discussion of a merger of the two institutions as early as 1890, but those talks dissolved quickly. In the 1920s, the Survey Commission on Higher Education in Cleveland took a strong stand in favor of federation and the community was behind the idea as well, but in the end all that came of the study was a decision by the two institutions to cooperate in founding Cleveland College, a special unit for part-time and adult students in downtown Cleveland.

By the 1960s, Reserve President John Schoff Millis and Case President T. Keith Glennan shared the idea that federation would create a complete university, one better able to attain national distinction. Financed by the Carnegie Corporation, Cleveland Foundation, Greater Cleveland Associated Foundation, and several local donors, a study commission of national leaders in higher education and public policy was charged with exploring the idea of federation. The Heald Commission, so known for its chair, former Ford Foundation President Henry T. Heald, predicted in its final report that a federation could create one of the largest private universities in the nation.

===Case Western Reserve University (1967–present)===
In 1967, Case Institute of Technology, a school with its emphasis on engineering and science, and Western Reserve University, a school with professional programs and liberal arts, came together to form Case Western Reserve University.

In 1968, the Department of Biomedical Engineering launched as a newly unified collaboration between the School of Engineering and School of Medicine as the first in the nation and as one of the first Biomedical Engineering programs in the world. The following year in 1969, the first Biomedical Engineering MD/PhD program in the world began at Case Western Reserve.

The first computer engineering degree program in the United States was established in 1971 at Case Western Reserve.

In 2003, the university unveiled a new logo and branding campaign that emphasized the &quot;Case&quot; portion of its name. In 2006, interim university president Gregory Eastwood convened a task group to study reactions to the campaign. The panel&#x27;s report indicated that it had gone so poorly that, &quot;There appear to be serious concerns now about the university&#x27;s ability to recruit and maintain high-quality faculty, fund-raising and leadership.&quot; Also, the logo was derided among the university&#x27;s community and alumni and throughout northeastern Ohio; critics said it looked like &quot;...a fat man with a surfboard.&quot;

On May 9, 2003, the 2003 Case Western Reserve University shooting occurred when Biswanath Halder entered the Peter B. Lewis Building of the Weatherhead School of Management where he then killed graduate student Norman Wallace and wounded two professors. Halder took people in the building hostage, and they ran and barricaded themselves and hid during the seven hours that the gunman roamed the building, shooting indiscriminately. He was finally apprehended by a SWAT team. Halder was convicted on multiple felony counts and sentenced to life in prison; he lost a 2008 appeal.

In 2007, the university&#x27;s board of trustees approved a shift back to giving equal weight to &quot;Case&quot; and &quot;Western Reserve&quot;. A new logo was chosen and implementation began July 1. In an open letter to the university community, interim president Eastwood admitted that &quot;the university had misplaced its own history and traditions.&quot; The &quot;Forward Thinking&quot; campaign was launched in 2011 by President Barbara Snyder and raised $1 billion in 30 months. The board of trustees unanimously agreed to expand the campaign to $1.5 billion, which reached its mark in 2017. The campaign ultimately raised $1.82 billion.

A 2020 United States presidential debate, the first of two, was held at the Samson Pavilion of the Health Education Campus (HEC), shared by the Cleveland Clinic.

In February 2020, president Barbara Snyder was appointed the president of Association of American Universities (AAU). Later that year, former Tulane University president Scott Cowen was appointed interim president. On October 29, 2020, Eric W. Kaler, former University of Minnesota president, was appointed as the new Case Western Reserve University president, effective July 1, 2021.

==Research==
Case Western Reserve University is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. Following is a partial list of major contributions made by faculty, staff, and students at Case Western Reserve since 1887:

* Case Western Reserve was the site of the Michelson-Morley interferometer experiment, conducted in 1887 by Albert A. Michelson of Case Institute of Technology and Edward W. Morley of Western Reserve University. This experiment proved the non-existence of the ether, and provided evidence that later substantiated Einstein&#x27;s special theory of relativity 
* Albert A. Michelson, who became the first American to win a Nobel Prize in science, taught at Case Institute of Technology. He won the prize in physics in 1907.
* Edward W. Morley, in 1895, made the most precise (to that date) determination of the atomic weight of oxygen, the basis for calculating the weights of all other elements.
* Dayton C. Miller, in 1896, performed the first full X-ray of the human body—on himself.
* George W. Crile, in 1905, performed the first modern blood transfusion, using a coupling device to connect blood vessels.
* Roger G. Perkins, in 1911, pioneered drinking water chlorination to eradicate typhoid bacilli.
* Claude S. Beck, in 1935, pioneered surgical treatment of coronary artery disease.
* Robert Kearns, in 1964, invented the intermittent windshield wiper used in most modern automobiles.
* Frederick Reines, in 1965, first detected neutrinos created by cosmic ray collisions with the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and developed innovative particle detectors. Case Western Reserve had selected Reines as chair of the physics department based on Reines&#x27;s work that first detected neutrinos emitted from a nuclear reactor—work for which Reines shared a 1995 Nobel Prize.
* Eric Baer, in 1967, pioneered the materials science of polymers and created the first comprehensive polymer science and engineering department at a major U.S. university.
* In 1987 the first edition of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Cleveland History&quot; was published.
* Huntington F. Willard of the School of Medicine and University Hospitals of Cleveland—collaborating with colleagues at Athersys, Inc., in 1997—created the first artificial human chromosomes, opening the door to more detailed study of human genetics and potentially offering a new approach to gene therapy.
* Roger Quinn, in 2001, developed robots such as Whegs that mimic cockroaches and other crawling insects Case Biorobotics Lab
* Tshilidzi Marwala, in 2006, began work on Local Loop Unbundling in Africa. He also chaired the Local Loop Unbundling Committee on behalf of the South African Government. Furthermore, Marwala and his collaborators developed an artificial larynx, developed the theory of rational counterfactuals, computer bluffing as well as establishing the relationship between artificial intelligence and the theory of information asymmetry.
* In 2007, a team from Case Western Reserve participated in the DARPA Urban Challenge with a robotic car named DEXTER. Team Case placed as one of 36 semi-finalists.
* Case Western Reserve University researchers are developing atomically thin drumheads which is tens of trillions times smaller in volume and 100,000 times thinner than the human eardrum. They will be made with the intent to receive and transmit signals across a radio frequency range which will be far greater than what we can hear with the human ear.
* Simon Ostrach and Yasuhiro Kamotani led spacelab projects entitled surface tension driven convection experiment (STDCE) aboard the Space Shuttle STS-50 and the re-flight STDCE-2 in USML-2 aboard STS-73 studying oscillatory thermocapillary flows in the absence of gravitational effects. 
* James T&#x27;ien has contributed to the study of numerous microgravity combustion space flight experiments including the Candle Flame In Non-Buoyant Atmospheres aboard the Space Shuttle STS-50 along with the reflight to Mir Orbiting Station in 1995, the Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS) taking place aboard the International Space Station along with the experiment reflight (BASS-2). He received the NASA Public Service Medal in 2000. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and serves on the Committee of Biological and Physical Sciences in Space.
* Salvatore Pais M.S., Ph.D., Engineer formerly with the Naval Research Laboratory, now working with the Air Force on hypersonic weapons program.

Today, the university operates several facilities off campus for scientific research. One example of this is the Warner and Swasey Observatory at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.

===Electrochemistry===
CWRU has contributed to the electrochemical sciences since the 1930s beginning with Frank Hovorka&#x27;s studies of quinhydrone (quinone) and other electrodes. Subsequently, Ernest Yeager carried out pioneering studies on ultrasound electrodeposition and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is directly relevant for H2-O2 fuel cells and batteries that use air electrodes such as zinc-air, iron-air, etc. The Yeager Center for Electrochemical Sciences (YCES), formerly the Case Center for Electrochemical Sciences, has provided annual workshops on electrochemical measurements since the late 1970s. The leadership in the Electrochemical Society have frequently included CWRU professors, and the university is home to six Fellows of the Electrochemical Society. Some notable achievements involve the work on ultrasound electrochemistry, oxygen reduction fundamentals, boron-doped diamond electrodes, in-situ electrochemical spectroscopy, polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes for high-temperature fuel cells (HT-PEM), methanol fuel cells, iron-based flow batteries, metal deposition studies, dendrite modeling and electrochemical sensors. Noted laboratories at Case include the Electrochemical Engineering and Energy Laboratory (EEEL), the Electrochemical Materials Fabrication Laboratory (EMFL), the Case Electrochemical Capacitor Fabrication Facility and the ENERGY LAB.

===Sears think[box]===
Larry Sears and Sally Zlotnick Sears think[box] is a public-access design and innovation center at Case Western Reserve University that allows students and other users to access prototyping equipment and other invention resources. The makerspace is located in the Richey Mixon building, a seven-story, 50,000 sq. ft. facility behind the campus athletic center. Over $35 million has been invested in space including in large part from a funding of $10 million from alumni Larry Sears and his wife Sally Zlotnick Sears. Larry Sears is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at CWRU and the founder of Hexagram, Inc. (now ACLARA Wireless Technologies).
Many projects and startup companies have come out of the makerspace.

==Student life==
The primary area for restaurants and shopping is the Uptown district along Euclid Ave adjacent to campus. Cleveland&#x27;s Little Italy is within walking distance. A campus shuttle runs to Coventry Village, a shopping district in neighboring Cleveland Heights. Popular with students, Downtown Cleveland, Ohio City, Legacy Village, and Shaker Square are all a short driving distance or accessible by RTA.

===Music===
WRUW-FM (91.1 FM) is the campus radio station of Case Western Reserve University. WRUW broadcasts at a power of 15,000 watts and covers most of Northeast Ohio.

Case Western Reserve is also home to 19 performing ensembles, including a cappella groups such as Dhamakapella, the Case Men&#x27;s Glee Club, Case Women&#x27;s Glee Club, Case in Point, and Solstice. Other ensembles include the Case/University Circle Symphony Orchestra, Camerata Chamber Orchestra, Case/CIM Baroque Orchestra, Concert Choir, Early Music Singers, Jazz Ensemble 1 and 2, Marching Spartans, Percussion Ensemble, Symphonic Winds, University Singers, Collegium Musicum, New Music Ensemble, Wind Ensemble, and Chamber Music.

Case Western Reserve&#x27;s main music venue is the Maltz Performing Arts Center. Case Western Reserve also has two main rehearsal spaces for performing arts music majors and school ensembles. Haydn Hall contains practice rooms with Steinway pianos, along with the department offices. Denison Hall serves as a rehearsal, practice, and teaching space for the music students and school ensembles, and is attached to Wade Commons. The Cleveland Youth Wind Symphony also rehearses in Denison Hall. Music majors may take lessons and courses at the Cleveland Institute of Music.

For performances, all students, ensembles, and a cappella groups use Harkness Chapel. The bands and orchestra also perform at Severance Hall (the on-campus home of the Cleveland Orchestra) and CIM&#x27;s Kulas Hall.

===Computing===
Case Western Reserve had the first ABET-accredited program in computer engineering.

In 1968, the university formed a private company, Chi Corporation, to provide computer time to both it and other customers. Initially this was on a Univac 1108 (replacing the preceding UNIVAC 1107), 36 bit, ones&#x27; complement machine. The company was sold in 1977 to Robert G. Benson in Beachwood, Ohio becoming Ecocenters Corporation.

Project Logos, under ARPA contract, was begun within the department on a DEC System-10 (later converted to TENEX (BBN) in conjunction with connection to the ARPANET) to develop a computer-aided computer design system. This system consisted in a distributed, networked, graphics environment, a control and data flow designer and logic (both hardware and software) analyzer. An Imlac PDS-1 with lightpen interrupt was the main design workstation in 1973, communicating with the PDP-10 over a display communications protocol written by Don Huff as a Master Thesis and implemented on the Imlac by Ted Brenneman. Graphics and animation became another departmental focus with the acquisition of an Evans &amp; Sutherland LDS-1 (Line Drawing System-1), which was hosted by the DEC System-10, and later with the acquisition of the stand-alone LDS-2.

Case Western Reserve was one of the earliest universities connected to the ARPANET, predecessor to the Internet. ARPANET went online in 1969; Case Western Reserve was connected in January 1971. Case Western Reserve graduate Ken Biba published the Biba Integrity Model in 1977 and served on the ARPA Working Group that developed the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) used on the Internet.

Case Western Reserve pioneered the early Free-net computer systems, creating the first Free-net, The Cleveland Free-Net, as well as writing the software that drove a majority of those systems, known as FreePort. The Cleveland Free-Net was shut down in late 1999, as it had become obsolete.

It was the first university to have an all-fiber-optic network, in 1989.

At the inaugural meeting in October 1996, Case Western Reserve was one of the 34 charter university members of Internet2.

The university was ranked No. 1 in Yahoo Internet Life&#x27;s 1999 Most Wired College list. There was a perception that this award was obtained through partially false or inaccurate information submitted for the survey, and the university did not appear at all on the 2000 Most Wired College list (which included 100 institutions). The numbers reported were much lower than those submitted by Ray Neff in 1999. The university had previously placed No. 13 in the 1997 poll.

In August 2003, Case Western Reserve joined the Internet Streaming Media Alliance, then one of only two university members.

In September 2003, Case Western Reserve opened 1,230 public wireless access points on the Case Western Reserve campus and University Circle.

Case Western Reserve was one of the founding members of OneCleveland, formed in October 2003. OneCleveland is an &quot;ultra broadband&quot; (gigabit speed) fiber optic network. This network is for the use of organizations in education, research, government, healthcare, arts, culture, and the nonprofit sector in Greater Cleveland.

Case Western Reserve&#x27;s Virtual Worlds gaming computer lab opened in 2005. The lab has a large network of Alienware PCs equipped with game development software such as the Torque Game Engine and Maya 3D modeling software. Additionally, it contains a number of specialized advanced computing rooms including a medical simulation room, a MIDI instrument music room, a 3D projection &quot;immersion room&quot;, a virtual reality research room, and console room, which features video game systems such as Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. This laboratory can be used by any student in the Electrical Engineering and computer science department, and is heavily used for the Game Development (EECS 290) course.

===Housing===
Residence halls are divided into two areas: one featuring suite-style rooms for second-year students in the South Residential Village, the other featuring double, single and suite style rooms for first-year students and upperclassmen in the North Residential Village. Suite style housing, known as the Village at 115th, was opened in fall 2005 for upperclassmen and features one- to nine-person, &quot;apartment-style&quot; residence halls.

First-year students are grouped into one of four residential colleges that are overseen by first-year coordinators. The Mistletoe, Juniper, and Magnolia residential colleges were established when the &quot;First Year Experience&quot; system was introduced, and Cedar was created in the fall of 2005 to accommodate a large influx of new students. In the fall of 2007, Magnolia was integrated into Mistletoe, however, it was later re-separated in the fall of 2012. The areas of focus for each college are – Cedar: visual and performing arts; Mistletoe: service leadership; Juniper: multiculturalism and Magnolia: sustainability.

===Greek life===
Nearly one-half of the campus undergraduates are said to be in a fraternity or sorority. There are dozens of Greek organizations on campus.

===Safety and security===
====Office of Emergency Management====
The Office of Emergency Management prepares for various levels of emergencies on campus, such as chemical spills, severe weather, infectious diseases, and security threats. RAVE, a multi-platform emergency alerting system, is operated by Emergency Management for issuing emergency alerts and instructions for events on campus. The Office of Emergency Management also performs risk assessment to identify possible safety issues and aims to mitigate these issues. Additionally, CERT is managed through Emergency Management, enabling faculty and staff members to engage in emergency preparedness. The Office of Emergency Management works closely with other campus departments, such as Police and Security Services, University Health Services, and Environmental Health and Safety, as well as community resources including city, state, and federal emergency management agencies.

====Police and security services====
Case operates a police force of sworn officers as well as a security officers. Starting as security only, the university expanded the role of protective services to include sworn officers who have arrest power and carry firearms. Some officers have additional training, such as SWAT training. On top of routine duties such as fingerprinting, traffic control, and bicycle registration, police and security also conduct investigations, undercover operations, and community outreach. Police and Security operate a fleet of vehicles, including police cruisers, scooters, and Smart cars. Police and Security are dispatched by a 24/7 campus dispatch center, responsible for emergency call handling, alarm monitoring, and video surveillance. Additionally, the dispatch center can send RAVE notifications and manages CWRU Shield, a mobile application allowing video, image, and text tips, safety checks, and viewing emergency procedures. CWRU Police also works closely with RTA transit police, University Circle Police, Cleveland Police, East Cleveland Police, Cleveland Heights Police, University Hospitals Police Department, and other surrounding emergency services. Police and Security, with conjunction with the Emergency Management Office, conduct tabletop drills and full-scale exercises involving surrounding emergency services.

====Emergency Medical Services====
Case Western Reserve University Emergency Medical Services (CWRU EMS) is a student-run all volunteer ambulance service and a National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation member. Covering University Circle, CWRU EMS is run solely by undergraduates volunteers, who provides free basic life support level treatment and transport to local hospitals. Crews receive medical direction from University Hospitals. CWRU EMS is under operational oversight by the Department of Public Safety. CWRU EMS provides both emergency rescue operations, medical standby services, and free community outreach programs such as Stop the Bleed (STB). CWRU EMS responds to over 300 calls for services annually, and operates 2 Type 3 ambulances, 549 and 660, out of the public safety headquarters. CWRU EMS is primarily operational during the academic year, but have the ability to respond off shift for members within the community.

===Traditions===
Starting in 1910, the Hudson Relay is an annual relay race event remembering and honoring the university relocation from Hudson, Ohio to Cleveland. Conceived by then-student, Monroe Curtis, the relay race was run from the old college in Hudson, Ohio to the new university in University Circle. Since the mid-1980s, the race has been run entirely in the University Circle area. The race is a distance of . It is held weekend before spring semester finals. Competing running teams are divided by graduating class. If a class wins the relay all four years, tradition dictates a reward of a champagne and steak dinner with the president of the university be awarded. Only six classes have won all four years—1982, 1990, 1994, 2006, 2011, and 2017. The winning classes of each year is carved on an original boulder located behind Adelbert Hall.

Springfest is a day-long concert and student group festival that occurs later in the same day as Hudson Relays. The Springfest Planning Committee brings in several bands and a beer garden, student groups set up booths to entertain the student body, and various inflatable carnival-style attractions are brought in to add to the festive atmosphere. Occasionally, due to adverse weather conditions, the festival must be moved indoors, usually to Thwing Center or Adelbert Gym.

Since 1976, the Film Society of Case Western Reserve University has held a science fiction marathon. The film festival, the oldest of its type, boasts more than 34 hours of non-stop movies, cartoons, trailers, and shorts spanning many decades and subgenres, using both film and digital projection. The Film Society, which is student-run and open to the public, also shows movies on Friday and Saturday evenings throughout the school year.

==Athletics==

Case Western Reserve competes in 19 varsity sports—10 men&#x27;s sports and 9 women&#x27;s sports. All 19 varsity teams wear a commemorative patch on their uniforms honoring Case alumnus, M. Frank Rudy, inventor of the Nike air-sole. The Spartans&#x27; primary athletic rival is the Carnegie Mellon Tartans. DiSanto Field is home to the football, men&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s soccer, and track and field teams.

Case Western Reserve is a founding and current member of the University Athletic Association (UAA). The conference participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s (NCAA) Division III. Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University were also founding members of the Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference (PAC) in 1958. The university remained a member of the PAC after the merger of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University and until 1983. In the fall of 1984, the university joined the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC) as a charter member. The 1998–99 school year marked the final season in which the Spartans were members of the NCAC. As the university had held joint conference membership affiliation with the UAA and the NCAC for over a decade. In 2014, the football team began competing as an associate member of the PAC, as only four out of the eight UAA member institutions sponsored football.

The Case Western Reserve cross country team won the conference every year for twelve straight years from 1967 to 1978 led by Coach Bill Sudeck, and also won conference titles in 1985, 1986, 1988, 1992, 1993, and 1994. The Case Western Reserve&#x27;s women&#x27;s cross country team finished the 2006 season with a UAA Championship and a bid to the NCAA Championship. The Lady Spartans finished 10th in the nation. The women&#x27;s team went on to finish even higher at nationals in 2007, earning a sixth-place finish at the NCAA DIII national championship. Both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Cross Country teams qualified for and competed in the NCAA DIII national championships in 2008, with the women&#x27;s team coming away with two All-Americans and a 16th-place finish. In 2009, they had two All-Americans and finished 15th. In 2010, the lady Spartans finished 19th, with one all-American. From 2006 to 2010 the women&#x27;s cross country team earned 8 individual All-American Titles, including current professional marathoner Esther Erb.

The Case Western Reserve football team reemerged in the mid-2000s under the direction of Head Coach Greg Debeljak. The 2007 team finished undefeated earning the school&#x27;s first playoff appearance and first playoff victory, winning against the Widener Pride.

<text>Vanity is the excessive belief in one&#x27;s own abilities or attractiveness to others. Prior to the 14th century, it did not have such narcissistic undertones, and merely meant &quot;futility&quot;. The related term vainglory is now often seen as an archaic synonym for &quot;vanity&quot;, but originally meant &quot;considering one&#x27;s own capabilities and that God&#x27;s help was not needed&quot;, i.e. unjustified boasting; although &quot;glory&quot; is now seen as having a predominantly positive meaning, the Latin term from which it derives, &quot;gloria&quot;, roughly means &quot;boasting&quot;, and was often used as a negative criticism.

==Religion and philosophy==
In many religions, vanity, in its modern sense, is considered a form of self-idolatry in which one likens oneself to the greatness of God for the sake of one&#x27;s own image, and thereby becomes separated and perhaps in time divorced from the Divine grace of God. In Christian teachings, &quot;vanity&quot; is an example of pride, one of the seven deadly sins. Also, in the Baháʼí Faith, Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah uses the term &#x27;vain imaginings&#x27;.

Philosophically, vanity may be a broader form of egotism and pride. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote that &quot;vanity is the fear of appearing original: it is thus a lack of pride, but not necessarily a lack of originality.&quot; One of Mason Cooley&#x27;s aphorisms is &quot;Vanity well fed is benevolent. Vanity hungry is spiteful.&quot;
==Symbolism==
In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a peacock, and in Biblical terms, by the Whore of Babylon. During the Renaissance, vanity was often represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto. Symbols of vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and the figure of death.

Some depictions of vanity include scrolls that read &quot;Omnia Vanitas&quot; (&quot;All is Vanity”), a quotation from the Latin translation of the Biblical book of Ecclesiastes. Although the term vanitas (Latin, &quot;emptiness&quot;) originally meant not obsession by one&#x27;s appearance, but the ultimate fruitlessness of humankind&#x27;s efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture.

&quot;The artist invites us to pay lip-service to condemning her,&quot; writes Edwin Mullins, &quot;while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her.&quot; The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining Venus.
In his table of the seven deadly sins, Hieronymus Bosch depicts a bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil; behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to Nicolas Tournier, which hangs in the Ashmolean Museum, is &quot;An Allegory of Justice and Vanity&quot;: a young woman holds a balance, symbolizing justice; she does not look in a mirror or the skull on the table before her. Johannes Vermeer&#x27;s painting &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, because the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes.

&quot;All is Vanity&quot;, by Charles Allan Gilbert (1873–1929), carries on this theme. An optical illusion, the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror. In the 1997 film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, Satan (Al Pacino) claims that &quot;vanity is his favourite sin&quot;.

Such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death.

<doc id="230560" wikidata="Q5232552" url="?curid=230560" title="David Cooperrider">
<text>David Cooperrider (born July 14, 1954), is the Fairmount Minerals Chair and Professor of Social Entrepreneurship at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University, and Faculty Director at the Center for Business as an Agent of World Benefit at Case.

Cooperrider also teaches at University of Pennsylvania as well as Claremont University, where he is The Peter F. Drucker Distinguished Fellow.

Cooperrider is the founder, together with Suresh Srivastva, of the theory of Appreciative Inquiry. Cooperrider&#x27;s original doctoral dissertation &quot;Appreciative Inquiry Into Organizational Life&quot; has been cited as “the first, and as yet, the best articulation of the theory and vision of appreciative inquiry.” It was completed and defended in 1985.

==Early life and education==
Cooperrider grew up in Oak Park, Illinois, and later completed his undergraduate studies at Augustana College in 1976. He earned a Master&#x27;s of Science at Sir George Williams University in 1983 and his Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University in 1985.

==Impact==
Cooperrider&#x27;s impact on the fields of leadership, human development and management theory is significant. His work at Case Western Reserve University in the early 1980s on Appreciative Inquiry anticipated and helped bring about today&#x27;s positive psychology movement, strengths-based leadership models, and positive organizational scholarship (POS). Kim S. Cameron, Robert Quinn and Jane Dutton called Appreciative Inquiry “a pillar.” Management scholar Robert Quinn, in a 2000 book &quot;Change the World&quot; declared that “Appreciative Inquiry is revolutionizing the field of organization development.”

Nobel Laureate Kofi Annan, likewise, wrote these words after calling upon David Cooperrider as an advisor and using Appreciative Inquiry to bring over 500 CEO&#x27;s into a world summit at the United Nations: “Without your innovative methodology of Appreciative Inquiry, it would have been very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to constructively engage so many leaders of business, civil society, and government.” A UN Leaders report for the Global Compact&#x27;s 8,000 corporations said “Appreciative Inquiry is the best large group method in the world today.” 

All of this also affected the experiential learning field, including his most recent work focused on &quot;Flourishing Organizations.&quot; In 2000, for his contribution to organizational learning and development, Cooperrider was given the &quot;Distinguished Contribution Award to Workplace Performance and Learning&quot; by the American Society for Training and Development.

Then, in 2004, for his world inquiry with Ron Fry into Business as an Agent of World Benefit, the Aspen Institute gave him the “Faculty Pioneer Award for Impact” in the domain of sustainable development. That work, including his book with Jane Dutton on &quot;The Organization Dimensions of Global Change: No Limits to Cooperation&quot;, has given birth to two major institutions and endowments: The Fowler Center for Sustainable Value and the ongoing global forum series hosted by Case Western Reserve University in partnership with the United Nations Global Compact and Academy of Management titled “The Global Forum for Business as an Agent of World Benefit.”

According to &quot;Ode Magazine&quot;, &quot;In the field of Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability, Cooperrider leads the movement towards a more sustainable future, ...&quot;.
==Bibliography==
Cooperrider has published numerous books and authored more than 60 articles and book chapters. His book with Diana Whitney &quot;Appreciative Inquiry: A Positive Revolution in Change&quot; has been a best-seller with multiple printings. His original article on Appreciative Inquiry (with Suresh Srivastva) in 1987, which appeared in the series Research in Organizational Change and Development, Vol. 1, has become an important source for its field since publication.

Cooperrider&#x27;s writings include:

<doc id="230563" wikidata="Q28129893" url="?curid=230563" title="Earthquake preparedness">
<text>Preparations for earthquakes can consist of survival measures, preparation that will improve survival in the event of an earthquake, or mitigating measures, that seek to minimise the effect of an earthquake. Common survival measures include storing food and water for an emergency, and educating individuals what to do during an earthquake. Mitigating measures can include firmly securing large items of furniture (such as bookcases and large cabinets), TV and computer screens that may otherwise fall over in an earthquake. Likewise, avoiding storing items above beds or sofas reduces the chance of objects falling on individuals.

Planning for a related tsunami, tsunami preparedness, can also be part of earthquake preparedness.

==Building design and retrofitting==

Seismic codes in earthquake prone areas may have specific requirements designed to increase new buildings&#x27; resistance to earthquakes. Older buildings and homes that are not up to code may be modified to increase their resistance. Modification and earthquake resistant design are also employed in elevated freeways and bridges.

Codes are not designed to make buildings earthquake proof in the sense of them suffering zero damage. The goal of most building designs is to reduce earthquake damage to a building such that it protects the lives of occupants and thus tolerance of some limited damage is accepted and considered a necessary trade-off. A supplement or precursor to retrofitting can be the implementation of earthquake-proof furniture.

Earthquake modification techniques and modern building codes are designed to prevent total destruction of buildings for earthquakes of no greater than 8.5 on the Richter Scale. Although the Richter Scale is referenced, the localized shaking intensity is one of the largest factors to be considered in building resiliency.

==Types of preparedness==
The basic theme behind preparedness is to be ready for an earthquake. Preparedness starts with an individual&#x27;s everyday life and involves items and training that would be useful in an earthquake. Preparedness continues on a continuum from individual preparedness through family preparedness, community preparedness and then business, non-profit and governmental preparedness. Some organisations blend these various levels. Business continuity planning encourages businesses to have a Disaster Recovery Plan. The US FEMA breaks down preparedness generally into a pyramid, with citizens on the foundational bottom, on top of which rests local government, state government and federal government in that order.

Children may present particular issues and some planning and resources are directly focused on supporting them. The US FEMA has advice noting that &quot;Disasters can leave children feeling frightened, confused, and insecure&quot; whether a child has experienced it first hand, had it happen to a friend or simply seen it on television. People with disabilities or other special needs may have special emergency preparation needs. FEMA&#x27;s suggestions for people with disabilities include having copies of prescriptions, charging devices for medical devices such as motorized wheel chairs and a week&#x27;s supply of medication readily available. Preparedness can also cover pets.

Preparedness can also encompass psychological preparedness: resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them.

A multi-hazard approach, where communities are prepared for several hazards, are more resilient than single hazard approaches and have been gaining popularity.

Long term power outages can cause damage beyond the original disaster that can be mitigated with emergency generators or other power sources to provide an emergency power system. The United States Department of Energy states: &quot;homeowners, business owners, and local leaders may have to take an active role in dealing with energy disruptions on their own.&quot; Major institutions like hospitals, military bases and educational institutions often have extensive backup power systems.
Preparedness does not stop at home or at school. The United States Department of Health and Human Services addresses specific emergency preparedness issues hospitals may have to respond to, including maintaining a safe temperature, providing adequate electricity for life support systems and even carrying out evacuations under extreme circumstances. FEMA encourages all businesses to have an emergency response plan and the Small Business Administration specifically advises small business owners to also focus emergency preparedness and provides a variety of different worksheets and resources.

 Given the explosive danger posed by natural gas leaks, Ready.gov states that &quot;It is vital that all household members know how to shut off natural gas&quot; and that property owners must ensure they have any special tools needed for their particular gas connections. Ready.gov also notes that &quot;It is wise to teach all responsible household members where and how to shut off the electricity,&quot; cautioning that individual circuits should be shut off before the main circuit. Ready.gov further states that &quot;It is vital that all household members learn how to shut off the water at the main house valve&quot; and cautions that the possibility that rusty valves might require replacement.

==Achieving preparedness==
Levels of preparedness generally remain low, despite attempts to increase public awareness.

Various methods exist to promote disaster preparedness, but they are rarely well documented and their efficacy is rarely tested. Hands on training, drills and face-to-face interaction have proven more successful at changing behaviour. Digital methods have also been used, including for examples educational videogames.

<doc id="230566" wikidata="Q2060780" url="?curid=230566" title="America's Stonehenge">
<text>America&#x27;s Stonehenge is a privately owned tourist attraction and archaeological site consisting of a number of large rocks and stone structures scattered around roughly within the town of Salem, New Hampshire, in the United States. It is open to the public for a fee as part of a recreational area which includes snowshoe trails and an alpaca farm.

A number of hypotheses exist as to the origin and purpose of the structures. One viewpoint is a mixture of land-use practices of local farmers in the 18th and 19th centuries and construction of structures by owner William Goodwin, an insurance executive who purchased the area in 1937. Some claim that the site has a pre-Columbian European origin, but this is regarded as pseudoarchaeological. Archaeologist David Starbuck has said: &quot;It is widely believed that Goodwin may have &#x27;created&#x27; much of what is visible at the site today.&quot;

The site was first dubbed Mystery Hill by William Goodwin. This was the official name of the site until 1982, when it was renamed &quot;America&#x27;s Stonehenge&quot;, a term coined in a news article in the early 1960s. The rebranding was an effort to separate it from roadside oddity sites and to reinforce the idea that it is an ancient archaeological site. The area is named after Stonehenge in England, although there is no evidence of cultural or historical connection between the two.

It is mentioned, as Mystery Hill, on New Hampshire Historical Marker No. 72.

== History ==
Archaeologists radio-carbon analysis of charcoal on the site shows that there were humans occupying the area 4,000 years ago.

In 1982, David Stewart-Smith, director of restoration at Mystery Hill, conducted an excavation of a megalith found in a stone quarry to the north of the main site. His research team excavated the quarry site under the supervision of the New Hampshire state archaeologist and discovered hundreds of chips and flakes from the stone. They concluded that this was evidence of tool manufacture, consistent with American indigenous lithic techniques, although no date could be ascertained. Archaeologist Curtis Runnels stated, &quot;No Bronze Age artifacts have been found there. ... In fact, no one has found a single artifact of European origin from that period anywhere in the New World.&quot;

The surface of the stone suggests that it was quarried with percussion techniques, indicating that the stone was modeled by indigenous stone workers as it was sculpted by indigenous stone tools rather than the metal tools that were used by European settlers. Some also speculate that the structure is an accurate astronomical calendar that can be used to predict lunar and solar events in North America.

The remains of a Native American wigwam have been found in the area and a replica can be seen next to the trail. Associated with it were two fire pits that date back to 2,000 years ago. A canoe dated to approximately 300 years ago can be seen in the museum. Various Native American tools and pottery have also been found on the site.

The site first appears in print in the 1907 &quot;History of Salem, N.H.&quot;:

Many believe that Pattee built the site in the nineteenth century, and no unequivocal pre-Columbian European artifacts have been found there.

The site&#x27;s history is muddled partly because of the activities of William Goodwin, who became convinced that the location was proof that Irish monks (the Culdees) had lived there long before the time of Christopher Columbus, and he sought to publicize the concept. He held a strong belief that the site was built by Irish monks, and because of this he rearranged many stones to fit his theory. The site has been altered by stone quarrying, and also by Goodwin and others who wanted to move the stones to what they considered to be their original locations; Goodwin might have been responsible for much of what can now be seen. Many of the stones have drill marks from the quarrying that took place on the site.

The myth that Irish people came to North America spawned from a story about an Irish priest named St. Brendan, who was said to have sailed to North America in the late 500s or early 600s. It was because of this myth that Goodwin and others believed the site to be built by Irish monks. However, there is no archaeological evidence of this happening.

In 2019, the site was vandalized with power tools, with police saying the person may have been trying to re-enact a scene from a fictional work. On March 4, 2021, NH State Police arrested a member of the online group &quot;QAnon&quot; and charged him with criminal mischief.

== The &quot;Sacrificial Stone&quot; ==

There is a so-called &quot;sacrificial stone&quot; which contains grooves on site that some say channeled blood, but it closely resembles &quot;lye-leaching stones&quot; found on many old farms that were used to extract lye from wood ashes, the first step in the manufacture of soap. The &quot;sacrificial stone&quot; could have also been a cider press bed stone, a common tool among colonial farmers in New England, the grooves in the table serving to collect the cider.

== In popular culture==

American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft was an enthusiast for New England megalith sites, and he visited Mystery Hill sometime between 1928 and the 1930s. The site is popularly attributed as inspiration for his story &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;. Scholars, however, place Lovecraft&#x27;s visit too late to have inspired the 1929 story.

Barry Fell in the book &quot;America BC: Ancient Settlers in the New World,&quot; published in 1976 and revised in 1986, provides evidence of occupation in pre-Columbian times based on astronomically linked positioning of stones and claims of Phoenician inscriptions written in Ogham. However, Barry Fell&#x27;s specialty was marine biology, and though he wrote about archaeology and epigraphy, experts have widely deemed his writings to be pseudo-archaeological.

The site has been featured or mentioned on a number of television programs including:
*American History Channel TV series &quot;Secrets of the Ancient World&quot; which aired on January 14, 2002, in which Boston University archaeology professor Curtis Runnels refuted the theory that it was built by Celts in ancient history.
*&quot;In Search of...&quot; TV series which focused on investigating mysterious phenomena. The show presented the theory that the site was of ancient Minoan origin. The episode aired on April 24, 1977.

<text>Urge Overkill is an American alternative rock band, formed in Chicago, consisting of Nathan Kaatrud, who took the stage name Nash Kato (vocals/guitar), and Eddie &quot;King&quot; Roeser (vocals/guitar/bass guitar). They are widely known for their song &quot;Sister Havana&quot; and their cover of Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Girl, You&#x27;ll Be a Woman Soon&quot;, which was used in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. &quot;Oui&quot;, their latest album, was released in 2022.

==History==
Kato and Roeser met at Northwestern University in 1985. They formed Urge Overkill (getting the name from a phrase in the lyrics of the Parliament song &quot;Funkentelechy&quot;) in Chicago in 1986, with drummer Pat Byrne, and released an EP, &quot;Strange, I...&quot;, on Ruthless Records. The EP was recorded by Kato&#x27;s friend Steve Albini. The full-length album &quot;Jesus Urge Superstar&quot; soon followed, again produced by Albini, and with Kriss Bataille on the drums.

&quot;Americruiser&quot; saw a change in style. Jack &quot;Jaguar&quot; Watt (of the band Baron Lesh) was the drummer and their sound from then on has been described as a &quot;Stonesy fusion of arena rock and punk&quot;. Produced by Butch Vig, &quot;Americruiser&quot; was widely praised, and scored a college radio hit with the lead single &quot;Ticket to L.A.&quot; Watt returned to Baron Lesh and was replaced by Blackie Onassis (real name: John Rowan) on the next album &quot;The Supersonic Storybook&quot;, which was named by Material Issue&#x27;s Jim Ellison and was released in 1991.

After opening for Nirvana on the American &quot;Nevermind&quot; tour, Urge Overkill returned to the studio to record another EP &quot;Stull&quot; in 1992, which featured the tracks &quot;Girl, You&#x27;ll Be a Woman Soon&quot; (produced and mixed by Kramer) and &quot;Goodbye to Guyville&quot;. Having a strong following by this time, they jumped from their indie label Touch &amp; Go to Geffen Records. Despite some criticism for the label switch, Urge Overkill&#x27;s major-label debut &quot;Saturation&quot; received strong reviews upon release in 1993, and to support the album, they opened for Pearl Jam on their &quot;Vs.&quot; tour. The single &quot;Sister Havana&quot; gave the band a hit record and broad recognition.

In 1993, the band contributed the track &quot;Take a Walk&quot; to the AIDS relief benefit album &quot;No Alternative&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. As the band recorded a follow-up album, cult filmmaker Quentin Tarantino used the group&#x27;s cover version of the Neil Diamond song &quot;Girl, You&#x27;ll Be a Woman Soon&quot; in his 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. When the movie became a hit, the song made it to number 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Urge Overkill retained their sound for &quot;Exit the Dragon&quot;, released in 1995. Kato and Roeser started feuding, resulting in Roeser leaving the band. Roeser went on to perform with Jim Kimball (formerly of The Jesus Lizard) as L.I.M.E. and with his brother John in the band Electric Airlines. Now a duo consisting of Kato and Onassis, Urge Overkill moved to Sony&#x27;s 550 Music in early 1997.

After a break of several years, Kato released a solo album in 2000 titled &quot;Debutante&quot;. Six of the album&#x27;s 13 songs were co-written with Onassis.

In 2004, Kato and Roeser reformed Urge Overkill without Onassis, recruiting former Gaza Strippers guitarist Mike &quot;Hadji&quot; Hodgkiss to play bass, keyboardist Chris Frantisak, and drummer Nate Arling. The reformed Urge Overkill performed shows at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, Double Door in Chicago, First Avenue in Minneapolis and the Bowery Ballroom in New York and continued to tour through Europe, North America, and Australia.

On September 19, 2010, on the free form radio program &quot;Anything Anything with Rich Russo&quot; on WRXP-FM in New York, the first Urge Overkill song in 15 years was played. The song was called &quot;Effigy&quot;. Russo also announced an Urge Overkill show on October 4, 2010 at Mercury Lounge in New York. Live shows began happening, including being the musical guest at a &quot;Roast of Quentin Tarantino&quot; on December 1, 2010. The band released &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Submarine&quot;, their first studio album in 16 years, in May 2011. A subsequent tour followed the release of the album. On October 8, 2011, Urge Overkill opened for Weezer at the Red Bull Riot Fest at the Congress Theater in Chicago.

Urge Overkill had continued to perform live occasionally from 2012 to 2018. By 2019, the band had begun working on new material for the follow-up to &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Submarine&quot;. &quot;Oui&quot;, their first studio album in 11 years, was released on January 28, 2022. Johnny &quot;Blackie Onassis&quot; Rowan died on 13 June 2023, at the age of 57.

<text>Fredrik Pacius (, ); in German and in Estonian Friedrich Pacius; 19 March 1809 – 8 January 1891) was a German-Finnish composer and conductor who lived most of his life in Finland. He has been called the &quot;Father of Finnish music&quot;.

Pacius was born in Hamburg. He was appointed music teacher at the University of Helsinki in 1834. In Helsinki he founded a musical society, the student choir Akademiska Sångföreningen and an orchestra. In 1848, Pacius wrote the music to the poem &quot;&quot; by Johan Ludvig Runeberg, which was to become commonly accepted as Finland&#x27;s national anthem. The same melody was also used for the Estonian national anthem &quot;Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm&quot; and the Livonian ethnic anthem &quot;Min izāmō, min sindimō&quot;.

In 1852, he composed &quot;Kung Karls jakt&quot; (English: &quot;King Charles&#x27; Hunt&quot;; Finnish: &quot;Kaarle-kuninkaan metsästys&quot;), which was the first Finnish opera, with a libretto in the style of Romantic nationalism, like the national anthem designed to convince Finland&#x27;s grand duke (i.e. the Russian Emperor Nicholas I) of the total loyalty of his subjects in Finland. The libretto was written by the author and historian Zacharias Topelius in close collaboration with Pacius.

His compositions also include a violin concerto, a symphony, a string quartet and several other operas.

Pacius died in Helsinki, aged 81.
