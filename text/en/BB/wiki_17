<text>George Herbert (3 April 1593 – 1 March 1633) was an English poet, orator, and priest of the Church of England. His poetry is associated with the writings of the metaphysical poets, and he is recognised as &quot;one of the foremost British devotional lyricists.&quot; He was born in Wales into an artistic and wealthy family and largely raised in England. He received a good education that led to his admission to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1609. He went there with the intention of becoming a priest, but he became the University&#x27;s Public Orator and attracted the attention of King James I. He sat in the Parliament of England in 1624 and briefly in 1625.

After the death of King James, Herbert renewed his interest in ordination. He gave up his secular ambitions in his mid-thirties and took holy orders in the Church of England, spending the rest of his life as the rector of the rural parish of Fugglestone St Peter, just outside Salisbury. He was noted for unfailing care for his parishioners, bringing the sacraments to them when they were ill and providing food and clothing for those in need. Henry Vaughan called him &quot;a most glorious saint and seer&quot;. He was never a healthy man and died of consumption at age 39.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

George Herbert was born 3 April 1593 in Montgomery, Montgomeryshire, Wales, the son of Richard Herbert (died 1596) and his wife Magdalen &quot;née&quot; Newport, the daughter of Sir Richard Newport (1511–1570). George was one of 10 children. The Herbert family was wealthy and powerful in both national and local government, and George was descended from the same stock as the Earls of Pembroke. His father was a member of parliament, a justice of the peace, and later served for several years as &quot;custos rotulorum&quot; (keeper of the rolls) of Montgomeryshire. His mother was a patron and friend of John Donne and other poets, writers and artists. As George&#x27;s godfather, Donne stood in after Richard Herbert died when George was three years old. Herbert and his siblings were then raised by his mother, who pressed for a good education for her children.

Herbert&#x27;s eldest brother Edward (who inherited his late father&#x27;s estates and was ultimately created Baron Herbert of Cherbury) became a soldier, diplomat, historian, poet, and philosopher whose religious writings led to his reputation as the &quot;father of English deism&quot;. Herbert&#x27;s younger brother was Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels to Kings Charles I and II.

Herbert entered Westminster School at or around the age of 12 as a day pupil, although later he became a residential scholar. He was admitted on a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1609, and graduated first with a Bachelor&#x27;s and then with a Master&#x27;s degree in 1616 at the age of 23. Subsequently, Herbert was elected a major fellow of his college and then appointed Reader in Rhetoric. In 1620 he stressed his fluency in Greek and Latin and attained election to the post of the University&#x27;s Public Orator, a position he held until 1627.

In 1624, supported by his kinsman the 3rd Earl of Pembroke, Herbert became a member of parliament, representing Montgomery. While these positions normally presaged a career at court, and King James I had shown him favour, circumstances worked against Herbert: the King died in 1625, and two influential patrons also died at about the same time. However, his parliamentary career may have ended already because, although a Mr Herbert is mentioned as a committee member, the &quot;Commons Journal&quot; for 1625 never mentions Mr. George Herbert, despite the preceding parliament&#x27;s careful distinction. In short, Herbert made a shift in his path away from the political future he had been pursuing, and turned more fully toward a future in the church.

Herbert was presented with the prebend of Leighton Bromswold in the Diocese of Lincoln in 1626, whilst he was still a don at Trinity College, Cambridge, but not yet ordained. He was not present at his institution as prebend, and it is recorded that Peter Walker, his clerk, stood in as his proxy. In the same year his close Cambridge friend Nicholas Ferrar was ordained Deacon in Westminster Abbey by Bishop Laud on Trinity Sunday 1626 and went to Little Gidding, two miles down the road from Leighton Bromswold, to found a small community. Herbert raised money (and contributed his own) to restore the neglected church building at Leighton.

=== Marriage ===
In 1628 or 1629, Herbert lodged at Dauntsey House in the north of Wiltshire, the home of his stepfather&#x27;s brother Henry Danvers and Henry&#x27;s elderly widowed mother Elizabeth. A day&#x27;s ride to the south, at Baynton House in Edington, lived the family of Henry&#x27;s cousin Charles Danvers (died 1626) who is said to have had a desire for Herbert to marry his daughter Jane. It was arranged for Herbert and Jane to meet, and they found mutual affection; Jane was ten years younger than George. They were married at Edington church on 5 March 1629.

===Priesthood===

In 1629, Herbert decided to enter the priesthood and the next year was appointed rector of the rural parish of Fugglestone St Peter with Bemerton, near Salisbury in Wiltshire, about 75 miles south-west of London. He was responsible for two small churches: the 13th-century parish church of St Peter at Fugglestone, near Wilton, and the 14th-century chapel of St Andrew at Bemerton, closer to Salisbury at the other end of the parish. Here he lived, preached and wrote poetry; he also helped to rebuild the Bemerton church and adjacent rectory out of his own funds. His appointment may have again been assisted by the Earl of Pembroke, whose family seat at Wilton House lay close to Fugglestone church.

While at Bemerton, Herbert revised and added to his collection of poems entitled &quot;The Temple&quot;. He also wrote a guide to rural ministry, entitled &quot;A Priest to the Temple or, The County Parson His Character and Rule of Holy Life&quot;, which he himself described as &quot;a Mark to aim at&quot;, and which has remained influential to the present day. Having married shortly before taking up his post, he and his wife gave a home to three orphaned nieces. Together with their servants, they crossed the lane for services in the small St Andrew&#x27;s church twice every day. Twice a week Herbert made the short journey into Salisbury to attend services at the cathedral, and afterwards would make music with the cathedral musicians.

===Death===
Herbert&#x27;s time at Bemerton was short. Having suffered for most of his life from poor health, in 1633 he died of consumption, only three years after taking holy orders. Jane died in 1661.

==Poetry==
Herbert wrote poetry in English, Latin and Greek. Shortly before his death, he sent a literary manuscript to his friend Nicholas Ferrar, reportedly telling him to publish the poems if he thought they might &quot;turn to the advantage of any dejected poor soul&quot;, otherwise to burn them. In 1633 all of his English poems were published in &quot;The Temple: Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations&quot;, with a preface by Ferrar. The book went through eight editions by 1690. According to Izaak Walton, when Herbert sent the manuscript to Ferrar, he said that &quot;he shall find in it a picture of the many spiritual conflicts that have passed between God and my soul, before I could subject mine to the will of Jesus, my Master&quot;. In this Herbert used the format of the poems to reinforce the theme he was trying to portray. Beginning with &quot;The Church Porch&quot;, they proceed via &quot;The Altar&quot; to &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;, and so onwards through the collection.

All of Herbert&#x27;s surviving English poems are on religious themes and are characterised by directness of expression enlivened by original but apt conceits in which, in the Metaphysical manner, the likeness is of function rather than visual. In &quot;The Windows&quot;, for example, he compares a righteous preacher to glass through which God&#x27;s light shines more effectively than in his words. Commenting on his religious poetry later in the 17th century, Richard Baxter said, &quot;Herbert speaks to God like one that really believeth in God, and whose business in the world is most with God. Heart-work and heaven-work make up his books&quot;. Helen Gardner later added &quot;head-work&quot; to this characterisation in acknowledgement of his &quot;intellectual vivacity&quot;. It has also been pointed out how Herbert uses puns and wordplay to &quot;convey the relationships between the world of daily reality and the world of transcendent reality that gives it meaning. The kind of word that functions on two or more planes is his device for making his poem an expression of that relationship.&quot;
 
Visually too the poems are varied in such a way as to enhance their meaning, with intricate rhyme schemes, stanzas combining different line lengths and other ingenious formal devices. The most obvious examples are pattern poems like &quot;The Altar&quot;, in which the shorter and longer lines are arranged on the page in the shape of an altar. The visual appeal is reinforced by the conceit of its construction from a broken, stony heart, representing the personal offering of himself as a sacrifice upon it. Built into this is an allusion to Psalm 51:17: &quot;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart.&quot; In the case of &quot;Easter Wings&quot; (illustrated here), the words were printed sideways on two facing pages so that the lines there suggest outspread wings. The words of the poem are paralleled between stanzas and mimic the opening and closing of the wings. In Herbert&#x27;s poems formal ingenuity is not an end in itself but is employed only as an auxiliary to its meaning.
The formal devices employed to convey that meaning are wide in range. In his meditation on the passage &quot;Our life is hid with Christ in God&quot;, the capitalised words &quot;MY LIFE IS HID IN HIM THAT IS MY TREASURE&quot; move across successive lines and demonstrate what is spoken of in the text. Opposites are brought together in &quot;Bitter-Sweet&quot; for the same purpose. Echo and variation are also common. The exclamations at the head and foot of each stanza in &quot;Sighs and Grones&quot; are one example. The diminishing truncated rhymes in &quot;Paradise&quot; are another. There is also an echo-dialogue after each line in &quot;Heaven&quot;, other examples of which are found in the poetry of his brother Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Alternative rhymes are offered at the end of the stanzas in &quot;The Water-Course&quot;, while the &quot;Mary/Army Anagram&quot; is represented in its title. In &quot;The Collar&quot;, Joseph Summers argues, Herbert goes so far as to use apparent formlessness as a formal and thematic device: &quot;the poem contains all the elements of order in violent disorder&quot; until the end, when the final four lines&#x27; regularity restores the reader&#x27;s sense of &quot;the necessity of order&quot;.

Once the taste for this display of Baroque wit had passed, the satirist John Dryden was to dismiss it as so many means to &quot;torture one poor word ten thousand ways.&quot; Though Herbert remained esteemed for his piety, the poetic skill with which he expressed his thought had to wait centuries to be admired again.

==Prose==
Herbert&#x27;s only prose work, &quot;A Priest to the Temple&quot; (usually known as &quot;The Country Parson&quot;), offers practical advice to rural clergy. In it, he advises that &quot;things of ordinary use&quot; such as ploughs, leaven, or dances, could be made to &quot;serve for lights even of Heavenly Truths&quot;. It was first published in 1652 as part of &quot;Herbert&#x27;s Remains, or Sundry Pieces of That Sweet Singer, Mr. George Herbert&quot;, edited by Barnabas Oley. The first edition was prefixed with unsigned preface by Oley, which was used as one of the sources for Izaak Walton&#x27;s biography of Herbert, first published in 1670. The second edition appeared in 1671 as &quot;A Priest to the Temple or the Country Parson&quot;, with a new preface, this time signed by Oley.

Like many of his literary contemporaries, Herbert was a collector of proverbs. His &quot;Outlandish Proverbs&quot; was published in 1640, listing over 1000 aphorisms in English, but gathered from many countries (in Herbert&#x27;s day, &#x27;outlandish&#x27; meant foreign). The collection included many sayings repeated to this day, for example, &quot;His bark is worse than his bite&quot; and &quot;Who is so deaf, as he that will not hear?&quot; These and an additional 150 proverbs were included in a later collection entitled &quot;Jacula Prudentum&quot; (sometimes seen as &quot;Jacula Prudentium&quot;), dated 1651 and published in 1652 as part of Oley&#x27;s &quot;Herbert&#x27;s Remains&quot;.

==Musical settings==
Herbert came from a musical family. His mother Magdalen Herbert was a friend of the composers William Byrd and John Bull, and encouraged her children&#x27;s musical education; his brother Edward Herbert of Cherbury was a skilled lutenist and composer. George Herbert played the lute and viol, and &quot;sett his own lyricks or sacred poems&quot;. Musical pursuits interested him all through his life and his biographer, Izaak Walton, records that he rose to play the lute during his final illness. Walton also gave it as his opinion that he composed &quot;such hymns and anthems as he and the angels now sing in heaven&quot;, while Walton&#x27;s friend Charles Cotton described him as a &quot;soul composed of harmonies&quot;.

More than ninety of Herbert&#x27;s poems have been set for singing over the centuries, some of them multiple times. In his own century, there were settings of &quot;Longing&quot; by Henry Purcell and &quot;And art thou grieved&quot; by John Blow. Some forty were adapted for the Methodist hymnal by the Wesley brothers, among them &quot;Teach me my God and King&quot;, which found its place in one version or another in 223 hymnals. Another poem, &quot;Let all the world in every corner sing&quot;, was published in 103 hymnals, of which one is a French version. Other languages into which his work has been translated for musical settings include Spanish, Catalan and German.

In the 20th century, &quot;Vertue&quot; alone achieved ten settings, one of them in French. Among leading modern composers who set his work were Edmund Rubbra, who set &quot;Easter&quot; as the first of his &quot;Two songs for voice and string trio&quot; (op. 2, 1921); Ralph Vaughan Williams, who used four by Herbert in &quot;Five Mystical Songs&quot;, of which &quot;Easter&quot; was the first and &quot;Antiphon II&quot; the last; Robin Milford, who used the original Fitzwilliam manuscript&#x27;s setting of the second part of &quot;Easter&quot; for his cantata &quot;Easter Morning&quot; (1932), set in two parts for soprano soloist and choir of children’s or women&#x27;s voices; Benjamin Britten and William Walton, both of whom set &quot;Antiphon&quot; too; Ned Rorem who included one in his &quot;10 poems for voice, oboe and strings&quot; (1982); and Judith Weir, whose 2005 choral work &quot;Vertue&quot; includes three poems by Herbert.

==Legacy==
The earliest portrait of Herbert was engraved long after his death by Robert White for Walton&#x27;s biography of the poet in 1674. Now in London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery, it served as basis for later engravings, such as those by White&#x27;s apprentice John Sturt and by Henry Hoppner Meyer in 1829.

Among later artistic commemorations is William Dyce&#x27;s oil painting of &quot;George Herbert at Bemerton&quot; (1860) in the Guildhall Art Gallery, London. The poet is pictured in his riverside garden, prayerbook in hand. Over the meadows is Salisbury Cathedral, where he used to join in the musical evensong; his lute leans against a stone bench and against a tree a fishing rod is propped, a reminder of his first biographer, Isaac Walton. There is also a musical reference in Charles West Cope&#x27;s &quot;George Herbert and his mother&quot; (1872), which is in Gallery Oldham: the mother points a poem out to him in a room that has a virginals in the background.

Most representations of Herbert, however, are in stained glass windows, of which there are several in churches and cathedrals. They include Westminster Abbey, Salisbury Cathedral and All Saints&#x27; Church, Cambridge. His own St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Bemerton installed in 1934 a memorial window, which he shares with Nicholas Ferrar. In addition, there is a statue of Herbert in his canonical robes, based in part on the Robert White portrait, in a niche on the West Front of Salisbury Cathedral.

==Veneration==

In the liturgy Herbert is remembered in the Church of England and the Episcopal Church on 27 February; also on 1 March in, for example, the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, being the day of his death. There are various collects for the day, of which one is based on his poem &quot;The Elixir&quot;:

Our God and King, who called your servant George Herbert from the pursuit of worldly honors to be a pastor of souls, a poet, and a priest in your temple: Give us grace, we pray, joyfully to perform the tasks you give us to do, knowing that nothing is menial or common that is done for your sake ... Amen.

The quote &quot;All may have, if they dare try, a glorious life, or a grave&quot; from Herbert&#x27;s &quot;The Church Porch&quot; is inscribed on the outer wall of St. John&#x27;s Church, Waterloo.

<text>Burano is an island in the Venetian Lagoon, northern Italy, near Torcello at the northern end of the lagoon, known for its lace work and brightly coloured homes. The primary economy is tourism.

==Geography==
Burano is from Venice, a 45-minute trip from St. Mark&#x27;s Square by vaporetto, a Venetian water bus.

The island is linked to Mazzorbo by a bridge. The current population of Burano is about 2,800. Originally, there were five islands and a fourth canal that was filled to become &quot;via e piazza Baldassare Galuppi&quot;, joining the former islands of &quot;San Martino Destra&quot; and &quot;San Martino Sinistra&quot;.

Burano has historically been subdivided into five sestieri, much like Venice. They correspond to the five original islands. The sixth sestiere is neighboring Mazzorbo:

Burano has a high population density, calculated at more than 13,000 per square kilometer, or more than twenty times the density of neighboring Mazzorbo. It is almost entirely covered by residential buildings, with few small green areas.

==History==


The island was probably settled by the Romans, and in the 6th century was occupied by people from Altino, who named it for one of the gates of their former city. Two stories are attributed to how the city obtained its name. One is that it was initially founded by the Buriana family, and another is that the first settlers of Burano came from the small island of Buranello, about to the south. 

Although the island soon became a thriving settlement, it was administered from Torcello and had none of the privileges of that island or of Murano. It rose in importance only in the 16th century, when women on the island began making lace with needles, being introduced to such a trade via Venetian-ruled Cyprus. When Leonardo da Vinci visited in 1481, he visited the small town of Pano Lefkara and purchased a cloth for the main altar of the Duomo di Milano. The lace was soon exported across Europe, but trade began to decline in the 18th century and the industry did not revive until 1872, when a school of lacemaking was opened. Lacemaking on the island boomed again, but few now make lace in the traditional manner as it is extremely time-consuming and therefore expensive.

Burano has been home to great artists such as the composer Baldassare Galuppi who was born in 1706, the singer-songwriter Pino Donaggio who was born in 1941 and the sculptor Remigio Barbaro who was born in 1911.

==Main sights==
Burano is also known for its small, brightly painted houses, which are popular with artists. The colours of the houses follow a specific system, originating from the golden age of its development. If someone wishes to paint their home, one must send a request to the government, who will respond by making notice of the certain colours permitted for that lot. The island is considered among the ten most colorful places in the world.

The heart of the village is Piazza Baldassare Galuppi which is the only square in the village. The Lace Museum, Town Hall, a well made entirely out of Istrian stone and the statue of Baldassare Galuppi made by Remigio Barbaro can also be found in the square.

Other attractions include the church of &quot;San Martino&quot;, with a leaning campanile and a painting by Giambattista Tiepolo (&quot;Crucifixion&quot;, 1727), the &quot;Oratorio di Santa Barbara&quot; and the &quot;Museum and School of Lacemaking&quot;.

==Transport==
The island forms part of the Actv waterbus network. The following lines connect to Burano:
9 (Burano-Torcello)
12 (Fondamente Nove-Murano-Burano-Treporti-Punta Sabbioni)
14 (S.Zaccaria-Lido SME-Punta Sabbioni-Burano)
A night service also operates.

<doc id="228722" wikidata="Q76925" url="?curid=228722" title="Venetian Lagoon">
<text>The Venetian Lagoon (; ) is an enclosed bay of the Adriatic Sea, in northern Italy, in which the city of Venice is situated. Its name in the Italian and Venetian languages, &#x27; (cognate of Latin&#x27; ), has provided the English name for an enclosed, shallow embayment of salt water: a lagoon.

==Location==
The Venetian Lagoon stretches from the River Sile in the north to the Brenta in the south, with a surface area of around . It is around 8% land, including Venice itself and many smaller islands. About 11% is permanently covered by open water, or canals, as the network of dredged channels are called, while around 80% consists of mud flats, tidal shallows and salt marshes. The Lagoon is the largest wetland in the Mediterranean Basin.

It is connected to the Adriatic Sea by three inlets: Lido, Malamocco and Chioggia. Situated at one end of a largely enclosed sea, the lagoon is subject to large variations in its water level. The most extreme are the spring tides known as the &quot;&quot; (Italian for &quot;high water&quot;), which regularly flood much of Venice.

The nearby Marano-Grado Lagoon, with a surface area of around , is the northernmost lagoon in the Adriatic Sea and is sometimes called the &quot;twin sister of the Venice lagoon&quot;.

==Development==
The Lagoon of Venice is the most important survivor of a system of estuarine lagoons that in Roman times extended from Ravenna north to Trieste. In the fifth and sixth centuries, the Lagoon gave security to Romanised people fleeing invaders (mostly the Huns and the Lombards). Later, it provided naturally protected conditions for the growth of the Venetian Republic and its maritime empire. It still provides a base for a seaport, the Venetian Arsenal, and for fishing, as well as a limited amount of hunting and the newer industry of fish farming.

The Lagoon was formed about six to seven thousand years ago, when the marine transgression following the Ice Age flooded the upper Adriatic coastal plain. Deposition of river sediments compensated for the sinking coastal plain, and coastwise drift from the mouth of the Po tended to form sandbars that closed tidal inlets.

The present aspect of the Lagoon is the result of human intervention. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Venetian hydraulic projects designed to prevent the lagoon from turning into a marsh reversed the natural evolution of the Lagoon. Pumping of aquifers since the nineteenth century has increased subsidence. Many of the Lagoon&#x27;s islands had originally been marshy, but a gradual drainage programme rendered them habitable. Many of the smaller islands are entirely artificial, while some areas around the seaport of the Mestre are also reclaimed islands. The remaining islands—-including those of the coastal strip (Lido, Pellestrina and Treporti)—-are essentially dunes.

Venice Lagoon has been inhabited from the most ancient times, but it was only during and after the fall of the Western Roman Empire that people coming from the Venetian mainland settled in numbers large enough to found the city of Venice. Today, the main cities inside the lagoon are Venice (at the centre of it) and Chioggia (at the southern inlet); Lido di Venezia and Pellestrina are inhabited as well, but they are considered part of Venice. However, most of the inhabitants of Venice, as well as its economic core (its airport and harbor), are on the western border of the lagoon, around the former towns of Mestre and Marghera. There are also two towns at the northern end of the lagoon: Jesolo (a famous sea resort) and Cavallino-Treporti.

==Ecosystem==
Bottlenose dolphins occasionally enter the lagoon, possibly for feeding.

The level of pollution in the lagoon has long been a concern. The large phytoplankton and macroalgae blooms in the late 1980s proved particularly devastating. Researchers have identified the lagoon as one of the primary areas where non-indigenous species are introduced into the Mediterranean Sea.
Cruise ships crossing the Venetian Lagoon have contributed to air pollution, surface-water pollution, decreased water quality, erosion, and loss of landscape.

From 1987 to 2003, the Venice Lagoon was harmed by a reduction in nutrient inputs and by macroalgal biomasses caused by climate change, and by changes in the concentration and distribution of nitrogen, organic phosphorus and organic carbon in the upper sediments. At the same time, however, the seagrasses started a natural process of recolonization, helping to partially restore the pristine conditions of the marine ecosystem.

<text>The Island of San Michele (, ; ) is an island in the Venetian Lagoon, Veneto, northern Italy. The island contains San Michele in Isola, a Roman Catholic church, as well as the San Michele Cemetery, Venice’s principal cemetery. It is associated with the sestiere of Cannaregio, from which it lies a short distance northeast.

==History==
Along with neighbouring San Cristoforo della Pace, the island was a popular place for local travellers and fishermen to land. Mauro Codussi&#x27;s Chiesa di San Michele in Isola of 1469, the first Renaissance church in Venice, and a monastery lie on the island, which also served for a time as a prison.
==San Michele cemetery==
The island has served as the principal cemetery of Venice since 1807.

<doc id="228732" wikidata="Q52441" url="?curid=228732" title="Torcello">
<text>Torcello (; ) is a sparsely populated island at the northern end of the Venetian Lagoon, in north-eastern Italy. It was first settled in 452 AD and has been referred to as the parent island from which Venice was populated. It was a town with a cathedral and bishops before St Mark&#x27;s Basilica was built.

==History==
After the downfall of the Western Roman Empire, Torcello was one of the first lagoon islands to be successively populated by those Veneti who fled the &quot;terra ferma&quot; (mainland) to take shelter from the recurring barbarian invasions, especially after Attila the Hun had destroyed the city of Altinum and all of the surrounding settlements in 452. Although the hard-fought Veneto region formally belonged to the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna since the end of the Gothic War, it remained unsafe on account of frequent Gothic (Sarmatian) invasions and wars: during the following 200 years the Lombards and the Franks fuelled a permanent influx of sophisticated urban refugees to the island’s relative safety, including the Bishop of Altino himself. In 638, Torcello became the bishop’s official seat for more than a thousand years and the people of Altinum brought with them the relics of Saint Heliodorus, now the patron saint of the island.

Torcello benefited from and maintained close cultural and trading ties with Constantinople: however, being a rather distant outpost of the Eastern Roman Empire, it could establish &quot;de facto&quot; autonomy from the eastern capital.

Torcello rapidly grew in importance as a political and trading centre: in the 10th century it had a population often estimated at 10,000–35,000 people, with 20,000 the most commonly cited estimate. However, some recent estimates by archeologists place it at closer to a maximum of 3,000. In pre-Medieval times, Torcello was a much more powerful trading center than Venice. Thanks to the lagoon’s salt marshes, the salines became Torcello’s economic backbone and its harbour developed quickly into an important re-export market in the profitable east-west-trade, which was largely controlled by Byzantium during that period.

The Black Death devastated the Venetian Republic in 1348 and again between 1575 and 1577. In three years, the plague killed some 50,000 people. In 1630, the Italian plague of 1629–31 killed a third of Venice&#x27;s 150,000 citizens. A further serious issue for Torcello specifically was that the swamp area of the lagoon around the island increased by the 14th century, partly because of the lowering of the land level. Navigation in the &quot;laguna morta&quot; (dead lagoon) was impossible before long and traders ceased calling at the island. The growing swamps also seriously aggravated malaria.

As a result, by the late 14th century, a substantial number of people left for the islands of Murano, Burano, or Rialto (modern-day Venice). In 1689, the bishopric transferred to Murano, and by 1797, the population had dropped to about 300. It now has a full-time population of just 10 people, including the parish priest, according to some sources, and only 12 in 2018.

==Sights==
Torcello&#x27;s numerous palazzi, its twelve parishes and its sixteen cloisters have almost disappeared since the Venetians recycled the useful building material. One small palazzo is the only remaining medieval structure, consisting of a cathedral, a church, the town&#x27;s former council chamber and archives (which house the museum), and the nearby basilica and campanile; the latter two were rebuilt in the year 1008.

Today&#x27;s main attraction is the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, founded in 639. It is of basilica-form with side aisles but no crossing, and has much 11th and 12th century Byzantine work, including mosaics (e.g. a vivid version of the Last Judgement). Other attractions include the 11th and 12th century church of Santa Fosca, in the form of a Greek cross, which is surrounded by a semi-octagonal porticus, and the Museo Provinciale di Torcello housed in two fourteenth century palaces, the &quot;Palazzo dell&#x27;Archivio&quot; and the &quot;Palazzo del Consiglio&quot;, which was once the seat of the communal government.

Another noteworthy sight for tourists is an ancient stone chair, known as &quot;Attila&#x27;s Throne&quot;. It has, however, nothing to do with the king of the Huns, but may have been the podestà&#x27;s or the bishop&#x27;s chair, or the seat where chief magistrates were inaugurated.
Torcello is also home to a Devil&#x27;s Bridge, known as the &quot;Ponte del Diavolo&quot; or alternatively the &quot;Ponticello del Diavolo&quot; (devil&#x27;s little bridge).

==Famous residents==
Ernest Hemingway spent some time there in 1948, writing parts of &quot;Across the River and Into the Trees&quot;. The novel contains representations of Torcello and its environs. In addition, numerous famous artists, musicians, and movie stars have spent time on the island, a quiet refuge. Torcello is the background for Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s short story &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;.

<text>Murano is a series of islands linked by bridges in the Venetian Lagoon, northern Italy. It lies about north of Venice and measures about across with a population of just over 5,000 (2004 figures). It is famous for its glass making. It was once an independent &quot;comune&quot;, but is now a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; of Venice.

==History==
Murano was initially settled by the Romans and from the sixth century by people from Altinum and Oderzo. At first, the island prospered as a fishing port and through its production of salt. It was also a centre for trade through the port it controlled on Sant&#x27;Erasmo. From the eleventh century, it began to decline as islanders moved to Dorsoduro. It had a Grand Council, like that of Venice, but from the thirteenth century, Murano was ultimately governed by a &quot;podestà&quot; from Venice. Unlike the other islands in the Lagoon, Murano minted its own coins.

Early in the second millennium hermits of the Camaldolese Order occupied one of the islands, seeking a place of solitude for their way of life. There they founded the Monastery of St. Michael (). This monastery became a great center of learning and printing. The famous cartographer, Fra Mauro, whose maps were crucial to the European exploration of the world, was a monk of this community. The monastery was suppressed in 1810 by French forces under Napoleon, in the course of their conquest of the Italian peninsula, and the monks were expelled in 1814. The grounds then became Venice&#x27;s major cemetery.

In 1291, all the glassmakers in Venice were required to move to Murano. In the following century, exports began, and the island became famous, initially for glass beads and mirrors. Aventurine glass was invented on the island, and for a while Murano was the main producer of glass in Europe. The island later became known for chandeliers. Although decline set in during the eighteenth century, glassmaking is still the island&#x27;s main industry.

In the fifteenth century, the island became popular as a resort for Venetians, and palaces were built, but this later declined. The countryside of the island was known for its orchards and vegetable gardens until the nineteenth century, when more housing was built.

Attractions on the island include the Church of Santa Maria e San Donato (known for its twelfth-century Byzantine mosaic pavement and said to house the bones of the dragon slain by Saint Donatus in the 4th century), the church of San Pietro Martire with the chapel of the Ballarin family built in 1506 and artworks by Giovanni Bellini, and the Palazzo da Mula. Glass-related attractions include the many glassworks, some Mediaeval and most open to the public, and the Murano Glass Museum, housed in the large Palazzo Giustinian.

==Murano glassmaking==

Murano&#x27;s reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire and the destruction of the city&#x27;s mostly wooden buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their furnaces to Murano in 1291. Murano glass is still associated with Venetian glass.

Murano&#x27;s glassmakers were soon numbered among the island&#x27;s most prominent citizens. By the fourteenth century, glassmakers were allowed to wear swords, enjoyed immunity from prosecution by the Venetian state and found their daughters married into Venice&#x27;s most affluent families. While benefiting from certain statutory privileges, glassmakers were forbidden to leave the Republic. However, many of them took the risks associated with migration and established glass furnaces in surrounding cities and farther afield — sometimes in England and the Netherlands.

Murano&#x27;s glassmakers held a monopoly on high-quality glassmaking for centuries, developing or refining many technologies including optically clear glass, enamelled glass (smalto), glass with threads of gold (aventurine), multicolored glass (millefiori), milk glass (lattimo), and imitation gemstones made of glass. Today, the artisans of Murano still employ these centuries-old techniques, crafting everything from contemporary art glass and glass jewellery to Murano glass chandeliers and wine stoppers.

Venice kept protecting the secret of the production of glass and of crystal but, notwithstanding it, the Republic partially lost its monopoly at the end of the sixteenth century, because of some glass makers who let the secret be known in many European countries.

Today, Murano is home to the Museo del Vetro or Murano Glass Museum in the Palazzo Giustinian, which holds displays on the history of glassmaking as well as glass samples ranging from Egyptian times through the present day.

Some of the companies that own historical glass factories in Murano are among the most important brands of glass in the world. These companies include Venini, Alessandro Mandruzzato Ferro Murano, Barovier &amp; Toso, Simone Cenedese and Seguso. To protect the original Murano Glass art from foreign markets, the most famous Glass Factories of this island have a trademark that certifies glass made products on the island of Murano.

The oldest Murano glass factory that is still active today is that of Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano, founded in 1866.

===Government protection===

As part of a broader view of protection and enhancement of typical and traditional Veneto product manufacturing and marketing, the Veneto Region protects and promotes the designation of origin of artistic glassworks created on the island of Murano, since glasswork is an inherent part of Venetian historical and cultural heritage.

The &quot;Vetro Artistico Murano&quot; trademark, filed and registered at the European Office for Harmonisation in Alicante, no. 00481812, has been established and is regulated by Regional Law no. 70, 1994.

===Link to Warsaw===

In the seventeenth century, the Murano-born Simone Giuseppe Belotti (in Polish, Szymon Józef Bellotti) became Royal Architect to the King of Poland and took part in designing some of Warsaw&#x27;s most important landmarks (:pl:Józef Szymon Bellotti). The palace he built for himself was named after his native island, &quot;Muranów&quot; — a Polish pronunciation of &quot;Murano&quot;. This palace eventually gave its name to the entire surrounding district. Muranów was and remains one of Warsaw&#x27;s most well known areas, especially associated with the city&#x27;s Jewish history.

==Geography==
Murano is composed of seven islands in the Venetian Lagoon, linked by bridges over eight channels.
==Economy==

Weakness in the economy has affected Murano but some 260 companies remain in operation, employing 1,100 staff members (2016 data) and the island receives numerous tourists.

<text>Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor is a novel by R. D. Blackmore, first published in three volumes in London in 1869. It is a romance based on a group of historical characters and set in the late 17th century in Devon and Somerset, particularly around the East Lyn Valley area of Exmoor. In 2003, the novel was listed on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

== Plot ==
John Ridd is the son of a respectable farmer in the 17th century Exmoor, a region in North Devon and Somerset, England. A notorious Doone clan, once nobles and now outlaws, murdered John’s father. Battling his desire for revenge, John (in West Country English, pronounced &quot;Jan&quot;) grows into a respectable farmer who cares well for his mother and sisters. He meets Lorna by accident and falls hopelessly in love . She turns out (apparently) to be the granddaughter of Sir Ensor, Lord of the Doones. Sir Ensor’s impetuous and now jealous heir Carver will let nothing thwart his plan to marry Lorna once he comes into his inheritance.

Sir Ensor dies, and Carver becomes Lord of the Doones. John helps Lorna escape to his family&#x27;s farm. Since Lorna is a Doone the Ridds have mixed feelings towards her but still defend her against Carver&#x27;s retaliatory attack. During a visit from the Counsellor, Carver&#x27;s father and the wisest Doone, Lorna&#x27;s necklace is stolen. Sir Ensor had told Lorna the necklace was her mother’s. A family friend soon discovers that the necklace belonged to a Lady Dugal, who was robbed and murdered by outlaws. Only her daughter survived.This reveals that Lorna is not a Doone after all, but heiress to a huge fortune. By law, but against her will, she must return to London as a ward in Chancery. Despite John and Lorna&#x27;s love, their marriage is out of the question.

King Charles II dies, and the Duke of Monmouth, the late king&#x27;s illegitimate son, challenges Charles&#x27;s brother James for the throne. Hoping to reclaim their ancestral lands, the Doones abandon their plan to marry Lorna to Carver and claim her wealth, and side with Monmouth. Monmouth is defeated at the Battle of Sedgemoor, and his associates are sought for treason. Although innocent, John Ridd is captured during the rebellion. An old friend takes John to London to clear John’s name. Reunited with Lorna, John thwarts an attack on her guardian, Earl Brandir. The king then pardons John and grants him a title.

The communities around Exmoor have tired of the Doones’ depredations. Knowing the Doones better than any other man, John leads the attack. All the Doone men are killed except the Counsellor and Carver, who escapes vowing revenge. When Earl Brandir dies, Lorna’s new guardian allows her to return to Exmoor and marry John. Carver bursts into their wedding, shoots Lorna and flees. In a blind rage, John pursues Carver. A struggle leaves Carver sinking in a mire and John so exhausted that he can only watch as Carver dies. John discovers that Lorna has survived, and after a period of anxious uncertainty they live happily ever after.

==Publication history==
Blackmore experienced difficulty in finding a publisher, and the novel was first published anonymously in 1869, in a limited three-volume edition of just 500 copies, of which only 300 sold. The following year it was republished in an inexpensive one-volume edition and became a huge critical and financial success. It has never been out of print.

==Reception==
The book received acclaim from Blackmore&#x27;s contemporary, Margaret Oliphant, and as well from later Victorian writers including Robert Louis Stevenson, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Thomas Hardy. George Gissing wrote in a letter to his brother Algernon that the novel was &quot;quite admirable, approaching Scott as closely as anything since the latter&quot;. A favourite among females, it was also popular among male readers, and was chosen by male students at Yale in 1906 as their favourite novel.

==Development of the novel==
By his own account, Blackmore relied on a &quot;phonologic&quot; style for his characters&#x27; speech, emphasising their accents and word formation. He expended great effort, in all of his novels, on his characters&#x27; dialogues and dialects, striving to recount realistically not only the ways, but also the tones and accents, in which thoughts and utterances were formed by the various sorts of people who lived on Exmoor in the 17th century.

Blackmore incorporated real events and places into the novel. The Great Winter described in chapters 41–45 was a real event.
He himself attended Blundell&#x27;s School in Tiverton which serves as the setting for the opening chapters. One of the inspirations behind the plot is said to be the shooting of Mary Whiddon on her wedding day at the parish church of Chagford, Devon, in the 17th century. Unlike the heroine of the novel, she did not survive, but is commemorated in the church. Apparently, Blackmore invented the name &quot;Lorna&quot;, possibly drawing on a Scottish source.

According to the preface, the work is a romance and not a historical novel, because the author neither &quot;dares, nor desires, to claim for it the dignity or cumber it with the difficulty of an historical novel.&quot; As such, it combines elements of traditional romance, of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s historical novel tradition, of the pastoral tradition, of traditional Victorian values, and of the contemporary sensation novel trend. Along with the historical aspects are folk traditions, such as the many legends based around both the Doones and Tom Faggus. The composer Puccini once considered using the story as the plot for an opera, but abandoned the idea.

<text>A bottle is a narrow-necked container made of an impermeable material (such as glass, plastic or aluminium) in various shapes and sizes that stores and transports liquids. Its mouth, at the bottling line, can be sealed with an internal stopper, an external bottle cap, a closure, or induction sealing.

==Etymology==
First attested in 14th century. From the English word &quot;bottle&quot; derives from an Old French word &quot;boteille&quot;, from vulgar Latin &quot;butticula&quot;, from late Latin &quot;buttis&quot; (&quot;cask&quot;), a latinisation of the Greek βοῦττις (&quot;bouttis&quot;) (&quot;vessel&quot;).

==Types==
===Glass===
====Wine====
The glass bottle represented an important development in the history of wine, because, when combined with a high-quality stopper such as a cork, it allowed long-term aging of wine. Glass has all the qualities required for long-term storage. It eventually gave rise to &quot;château bottling&quot;, the practice where an estate&#x27;s wine is put in a bottle at the source, rather than by a merchant. Prior to this, wine used to be sold by the barrel (and before that, the amphora) and put into bottles only at the merchant&#x27;s shop, if at all. This left large and often abused opportunities for fraud and adulteration, as consumers had to trust the merchant as to the contents. It is thought that most wine consumed outside of wine-producing regions had been tampered with in some way. Also, not all merchants were careful to avoid oxidation or contamination while bottling, leading to large bottle variation. Particularly in the case of port, certain conscientious merchants&#x27; bottling of old ports fetch higher prices even today. To avoid these problems, most fine wine is bottled at the place of production (including all port, since 1974).

There are many sizes and shapes of bottles used for wine. Some of the known shapes:
* &quot;Bordeaux&quot;: This bottle is roughly straight sided with a curved &quot;shoulder&quot; that is useful for catching sediment and is also the easiest to stack. Traditionally used in Bordeaux but now worldwide, this is probably the most common type.
* &quot;Burgundy&quot;: Traditionally used in Burgundy, this has sides that taper down about 2/3 of the height to a short cylindrical section, and does not have a shoulder.
* &quot;Champagne&quot;: Traditionally used for Champagne, it is similar to a Burgundy bottle, but with a wider base and heavier construction to withstand the pressure from the carbonation of the sparkling wine.

====Codd-neck====
In 1872, British soft drink makers Hiram Codd of Camberwell, London, designed and patented a bottle designed specifically for carbonated drinks. The Codd-neck bottle was designed and manufactured to enclose a marble and a rubber washer/gasket in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer, sealing in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape, as can be seen in the photo to the left, to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.

Soon after its introduction, the bottle became extremely popular with the soft drink and brewing industries, mainly in Europe, Asia and Australasia, though some alcohol drinkers disdained the use of the bottle. One etymology of the term &quot;&quot; originates from beer sold in Codd bottles, though this is generally dismissed as a folk etymology.

The bottles were regularly produced for many decades, but gradually declined in usage. Since children smashed the bottles to retrieve the marbles, they are relatively scarce and have become collector items; particularly in the UK. A cobalt-coloured Codd bottle today fetches hundreds of British pounds at auction. The Codd-neck design is still used for the Japanese soft drink Ramune and in the Indian drink called Banta.

===Plastic===
The plastic is strain oriented in the stretch blow molding manufacturing process. Plastic bottles are typically used to store liquids such as water, soft drinks, motor oil, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, milk, and ink. The size ranges from very small sample bottles to very large carboys. The main advantages of plastic bottles over glass are their superior resistance to breakage, in both production and transportation, as well as their light weight and low cost of production. Disadvantages include widespread plastic pollution.

===Aluminium===

An aluminium bottle is a bottle made of aluminium (or aluminum, outside of British English). In some countries, it is also called a &quot;bottlecan&quot;. It usually holds beer, soft drinks or wine.

===Hot water===

A hot water bottle is a bottle filled with hot water used to provide warmth. It can be made from various materials, most commonly rubber, but has historically been made from harder materials such as metal, glass, earthenware, or wood.

==Miscellany==
Bottles are often recycled according to the SPI recycling code for the material.

<text>GNOME Display Manager (GDM) is a display manager (a graphical login manager) for the windowing systems X11 and Wayland.

The X Window System by default uses the XDM display manager. However, resolving XDM configuration issues typically involves editing a configuration file. GDM allows users to customize or troubleshoot settings without having to resort to a command line. Users can pick their session type on a per-login basis. GDM 2.38.0 is the last version that features customization with themes; subsequent releases do not support themes.

==Software architecture==
GDM is a display manager that implements all significant features required for managing attached and remote displays. GDM was written from scratch and does not contain any XDM or X Consortium code.

===Components===
GDM comprises the following components:
* Chooser – a program used to select a remote host as the source for a remote display on the attached display (gdm-host-chooser)
* Greeter – the graphical login window (provided by GNOME Shell)
* Pluggable authentication module (PAM)
* X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)

==Hidden features==
Until version 2.22, GDM had a few Easter eggs, in the form of strings to be entered in the username box. These can be found in the source file &quot;gui/guilogin.c&quot;, in a function named &quot;evil&quot;.

* Dancing login – type &quot;Start Dancing&quot; to start, and &quot;Stop Dancing&quot; to stop.
** (This requires the standard greeter (&quot;GTK+ Greeter&quot;), rather than the graphical one (&quot;Themed Greeter&quot;)).
* &quot;Gimme Random Cursor&quot; – can be used repeatedly.
** This changes the mouse cursor to a randomly selected 1 of 77 different &quot;cursor fonts&quot; as defined in the X11 specification.
* &quot;Require Quarter&quot; (or &quot;Require Quater&quot;, for backward compatibility with a typo in the original), then log in normally – a dialog box that reads &quot;Please insert 25 cents to log in.&quot; appears after entering the password. Clicking &quot;OK&quot; allows the login process to proceed as normal.

===Queen of England===
Some of the copyright notices of GDM refer to the &quot;Queen of England&quot;, whom release announcements from version 2.2.1 also named as a maintainer. Subsequently, developers realised that the title &quot;Queen of England&quot; has not existed since the Acts of Union of 1707.

<doc id="228753" wikidata="Q1345203" url="?curid=228753" title="Power (international relations)">
<text>In international relations, power is defined in several different ways. Material definitions of state power emphasize economic and military power. Other definitions of power emphasize the ability to structure and constitute the nature of social relations between actors. Power is an attribute of particular actors in their interactions, as well as a social process that constitutes the social identities and capacities of actors.

International relations scholars use the term polarity to describe the distribution of power in the international system. Unipolarity refers to an international system characterized by one hegemon (e.g. the United States in the post-Cold War period), bipolarity to an order with two great powers or blocs of states (e.g. the Cold War), and multipolarity refers to the presence of three or more great powers. Those states that have significant amounts of power within the international system are referred to as small powers, middle powers, regional powers, great powers, superpowers, or hegemons, although there is no commonly accepted standard for what defines a powerful state.

Entities other than states can have power in international relations. Such entities can include multilateral international organizations, military alliance organizations like NATO, multinational corporations like Walmart, non-governmental organizations such as the Roman Catholic Church, or other institutions such as the Hanseatic League and technology companies like Facebook and Google.

== Concepts of political power ==
Michael Barnett and Raymond Duvall define power as &quot;the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate.&quot; They reject definitions of power that conflate power as any and all effects because doing so makes power synonymous with causality. They also reject persuasion as part of the definition of power, as it revolves around actors freely and voluntarily changing their minds once presented with new information.

Political scientists, historians, and practitioners of international relations (diplomats) have used the following concepts of political power:
* Power as a goal of states or leaders;
* Power as a measure of influence or control over outcomes, events, actors and issues;
* Power as victory in conflict and the attainment of security;
* Power as control over resources and capabilities;
* Power as status, which some states or actors possess and others do not.

===Power as a goal===
The view that hegemony is a goal in international relations has long been discussed by political theorists. Philosophers such as Thucydides, Niccolo Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes and Hans Morgenthau are thought to have provided a realistic portrait of this political aim. Especially among Classical Realist thinkers, political dominance is the aim of nation states. The German military thinker Carl von Clausewitz is considered to be the quintessential projection of European growth across the continent. In more modern times, Claus Moser has elucidated theories centre of distribution of power in Europe after the Holocaust, and the power of universal learning as its counterpoint. Jean Monnet was a French left-wing social theorist, stimulating expansive Eurocommunism, who followed on the creator of modern European community, the diplomat and statesman Robert Schuman.

===Power as influence===
Political scientists principally use &quot;power&quot; in terms of an actor&#x27;s ability to exercise influence over other actors within the international system. This influence can be coercive, attractive, cooperative, or competitive. Mechanisms of influence can include the threat or use of force, economic interaction or pressure, diplomacy, and cultural exchange.

Under certain circumstances, states can organize a sphere of influence or a bloc within which they exercise predominant influence. Historical examples include the spheres of influence recognized under the Concert of Europe, or the recognition of spheres during the Cold War following the Yalta Conference. The Eastern Bloc, the Western Bloc, and the Non-Aligned Movement were the blocs that arose out of the Cold War contest. Military alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact are another forum through which influence is exercised. However, &quot;realist&quot; theory attempted to maintain the balance of power from the development of meaningful diplomatic relations that can create a hegemony within the region. British foreign policy, for example, dominated Europe through the Congress of Vienna after the defeat of France. They continued the balancing act with the Congress of Berlin in 1878, to appease Russia and Germany from attacking Turkey. Britain has sided against the aggressors on the European continent—i.e. the German Empire, Nazi Germany, Napoleonic France or the Austrian Empire, known during the Great War as the Central Powers and, in World War II as the Axis Powers.

International orders have both a material and social component. Martha Finnemore argues that unipolarity does not just entail a material superiority by the unipole, but also a social structure whereby the unipole maintains its status through legitimation, and institutionalization. In trying to obtain legitimacy from the other actors in the international system, the unipole necessarily gives those actors a degree of power. The unipole also obtains legitimacy and wards off challenges to its power through the creation of institutions, but these institutions also entail a diffusion of power away from the unipole. David Lake has argued along similar lines that legitimacy and authority are key components of international order.

Susan Strange made a key contribution to International Political Economy on the issue of power, which she considered essential to the character and dynamics of the global economy. Strange was skeptical of static indicators of power, arguing that it was structural power that mattered. In particular, interactions between states and markets mattered. She pointed to the superiority of the American technology sector, dominance in services, and the position of the U.S. dollar as the top international currency as real indicators of lasting power. She distinguished between relational power (the power to compel A to get B to do something B does not want to do) and structural power (the power to shape and determine the structure of the global political economy). Political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham L. Newman argue that state power is in part derived from control over important nodes in global networks of informational and financial exchange, which means that states can &quot;weaponize interdependence&quot; by fighting over control of these nodes.

===Power as capability===
American author Charles W. Freeman, Jr. described power as the following:
&quot;Power&quot; is also used to describe the resources and capabilities of a state. This definition is quantitative and is most often used by geopoliticians and the military. Capabilities are thought of in tangible terms—they are measurable, weighable, quantifiable assets. A good example for this kind of measurement is the &quot;Composite Indicator on Aggregate Power&quot;, which involves 54 indicators and covers the capabilities of 44 states in Asia-Pacific from 1992 to 2012. Hard power can be treated as a potential and is not often enforced on the international stage.

Chinese strategists have such a concept of national power that can be measured quantitatively using an index known as Comprehensive National Power.

Michael Beckley argues that gross domestic product and military spending are imprecise indicators of power. He argues that better measurements of power should take into account &quot;net&quot; indicators of powers: &quot;[Gross] indicators systematically exaggerate the wealth and military capabilities of poor, populous countries, because they tally countries&#x27; resources without deducting the costs countries pay to police, protect, and serve their people. A country with a big population might produce vast output and field a large army, but it also may bear massive welfare and security burdens that drain its wealth and bog down its military, leaving it with few resources for power projection abroad.&quot;

==Power as status==

===Definitions===
Much effort in academic and popular writing is devoted to deciding which countries have the status of &quot;power&quot;, and how this can be measured. If a country has &quot;power&quot; (as influence) in military, diplomatic, cultural, and economic spheres, it might be called a &quot;power&quot; (as status). There are several and inclusion of a state in one category or another is fraught with difficulty and controversy. In his famous 1987 work, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,&quot; British-American historian Paul Kennedy charts the relative status of the various powers from AD 1500 to 2000. He does not begin the book with a theoretical definition of &quot;great power&quot;; however he lists them, separately, for many different eras. Moreover, he uses different working definitions of great power for different eras. For example
Neorealist scholars frequently define power as entailing military capabilities and economic strength. Classical realists recognized that the ability to influence depended on psychological relationships that touched on ethical principles, legitimacy and justice, as well as emotions, leaders&#x27; skill and power over opinion.

===Categories of power===

In the modern geopolitical landscape, a number of terms are used to describe various types of powers, which include the following:
* Hegemony: a state that has the power to shape the international system and &quot;control the external behavior of all other states.&quot; Hegemony can be regional or global. Unlike unipolarity, which is a power preponderance within an anarchic international system of nominally equal states, hegemony assumes a hierarchy where the most powerful can control other states.
* Unipole: a state that enjoys a preponderance of power and faces no competitor states. According to William Wohlforth, &quot;a unipolar system is one in which a counterbalance is impossible. When a counterbalance becomes possible, the system is not unipolar.&quot; A unipolar state is not the same as an empire or a hegemon that can control the behavior of all other states. 
* Superpower: In 1944, William T. R. Fox defined &quot;superpower&quot; as &quot;great power plus great mobility of power&quot; and identified three states, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and the United States. With the decolonisation of the British Empire following World War II, and then the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has remained to be the sole superpower. China is now considered an emerging global superpower by many scholars.
* Great power: In historical mentions, the term &quot;great power&quot; refers to the states that have strong political, cultural and economical influence over nations around them and across the world.
* Middle power: A subjective description of influential second-tier states that could not quite be described as great or small powers. A middle power has sufficient strength and authority to stand on its own without the need of help from others (particularly in the realm of security) and takes diplomatic leads in regional and global affairs. Clearly not all middle powers are of equal status; some are members of forums such as the G20 and play important roles in the United Nations and other international organisations such as the WTO.
* Small power: The International System is for the most part made up by &quot;small powers&quot;. They are instruments of the other powers and may at times be dominated; but they cannot be ignored.

====Other categories====
* Emerging power: A transitional category in which a state or union of states is viewed as on a trajectory of increasing global influence.
* Regional power: This term is used to describe a nation that exercises influence and power within a region. Being a &quot;regional power&quot; is not mutually exclusive with any of the other categories of power. The majority of them exert a strategic degree of influence as minor or secondary regional powers, although primary regional powers (like Australia or Brazil) can also have an important role in international affairs outside of its region too.
* Cultural superpower: Refers to a country whose culture, arts, sports, or entertainment have worldwide appeal, significant international popularity or large influence on much of the world. Among the countries described as such are Brazil, China, France, Greece, India, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, although the criteria upon which this is determined are sometimes debated. Unlike traditional forms of national power, the term cultural superpower is in reference to a nation&#x27;s soft power capabilities.
* Energy superpower: Describes a country that supplies large amounts of energy resources (crude oil, natural gas, coal, uranium, etc.) to a significant number of other states, and therefore has the potential to influence world markets to gain a political or economic advantage. Saudi Arabia and Russia are generally acknowledged as the world&#x27;s current energy superpowers, given their abilities to globally influence or even directly control prices to certain countries. Australia and Canada are potential energy superpowers due to their large natural resources.

==Hard, soft and smart power==
Some political scientists distinguish between two types of power: Hard and Soft. The former is coercive (example: military invasion) while the latter is attractive (example: broadcast media or cultural invasion).

Hard power refers to coercive tactics: the threat or use of armed forces, economic pressure or sanctions, assassination and subterfuge, or other forms of intimidation. Hard power is generally associated to the stronger of nations, as the ability to change the domestic affairs of other nations through military threats. Realists and neorealists, such as John Mearsheimer, are advocates of the use of such power for the balancing of the international system.

Joseph Nye is the leading proponent and theorist of soft power. Instruments of soft power include debates on cultural values, dialogues on ideology, the attempt to influence through good example, and the appeal to commonly accepted human values. Means of exercising soft power include diplomacy, dissemination of information, analysis, propaganda, and cultural programming to achieve political ends.

Others have synthesized soft and hard power, including through the field of smart power. This is often a call to use a holistic spectrum of statecraft tools, ranging from soft to hard.

<text>Bottle variation is the degree to which different bottles, nominally of the same product, can have different taste, smell, etc.

There are many possible causes of bottle variation:
* variation in the contents prior to packaging
* variation in the packaging components
* variation in the product and packaging processes
* variation in storage, distribution, cold chain, etc.
* variation in the quantity of contents

==Wine==
Different bottles, nominally of the same wine, can taste and smell different.

One factor is found in the variable oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of cork stoppers, which translates to a degree of bottle variation.

Before the advent of inexpensive stainless steel tanks, it was not customary to blend all the wine together and bottle it at once, a process called &quot;assemblage&quot;. Instead, the winemaker would take his or her siphon from barrel to barrel and fill the bottles from a single barrel at a time. Some traditional and/or idiosyncratic wineries still do this, including Château Musar. Also, buyers and sellers of bulk wine typically do not have access to a multi-million litre tank, and so often the wine will vary depending on which tank it came from.

Bottle variation that increases over time typically comes from the packaging. Exposure to heat or light can cause a wine to mature more quickly or even make it taste &quot;cooked&quot;. Bottles aged in the chilly cellars of Sweden&#x27;s alcohol monopoly are famous for tasting younger than the same wine stored at a more typical 13 °C (55 °F). Finally, not all corks seal equally well, and a faulty cork will allow air into the bottle, oxidizing it prematurely. However, a corked wine would be described as a simple fault rather than bottle variation, even though the corked bottle would be clearly different from a non-corked example.

Sometimes, it is not clear what causes the variation. Bottles stored together their entire lives, with no obvious faults, can taste completely different. Thus there is a saying, &quot;There are no great old wines, only great bottles.&quot;

<text>The Lido, or Venice Lido (), is an barrier island in the Venetian Lagoon, Northern Italy; it is home to about 20,400 residents. The Venice Film Festival takes place at the Lido in late August/early September.
==Geography==
The Lido island is one of the two barrier islands of the Lagoon of Venice; the other is Pellestrina. They form the central part of the coastline of the lagoon on the Adriatic Sea. The peninsula of Cavallino/Punta Sabbioni forms the northern part and the peninsula of Sottomarina forms the southern part. The sea has access to the lagoon through three inlets between the islands and between the islands and the peninsulas. At the northern end of Lido there is the Lido inlet which separates it from Cavallino/Punta Sabbioni and at the southern end there is the Malamocco inlet which separates it from Pellestrina. These two inlets have been dredged to a greater depth to allow big ships through. The Malamocco inlet is the deepest one and is used by container ships and oil tankers to reach the commercial and industrial port of Marghera. The Lido inlet is the widest one (c.1 km) and is used by cruise ships to reach Venice.

Lido is a long and narrow island which gets wider in its northern tract. At least half the seaward coast has sandy beaches. Much of the beach at the town of Lido belongs to various hotels. There are large public beaches towards the northern and southern ends.

The island is home to a town and a village. The town is in the north. It is also called Lido (population 15,128 in 2019). It has four neighbourhoods: San Nicolò and Santa Maria Elisabetta are on the lagoon side coast (the landing stage for the Venice ferry is in the former and the one for the water bus is in the latter), while La Favorita and Quattro Fontaine are on the seaward coast. It developed in the 19th century as a tourist centre, both as a leisure seaside resort and as a balneotherapy resort. It has many 19th century villas built in Liberty style (the Italian version of Art Nouveau) and many hotels. It is famous for being the seat of the Venice Film Festival and for its grand hotels, such as the Grand Hotel des Bains, the Hotel Excelsior. and the Hotel Ausonia &amp; Hungaria which have hosted celebrities, artists and writers, major businessmen, politicians and royalty. The Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (27 m wide and c. 700 m long) crosses the town from coast to coast and links the water bus landing stage to the beach.

The village of Malamocco (with a population of 1030 as of 2019) is on the lagoon side coast, in the central-southern part of the island. From the 12th century to the 19th century it was the only significant settlement on the island. It was built after the settlement of Metamaucum, which had been the second capital of the Duchy of Venetia, was submerged by a storm surge.

At the southern end of the island is Alberoni, an area of sand dunes. It has Venice&#x27;s golf course and the Alberoni Dune Oasis which has one of the largest and best-preserved dune systems on the coasts of the Northern Adriatic Sea, with dunes up to 10 meters high, a large, c. 30 hectares, pine forest and unique species of flora and fauna.

==History==
===Metamaucum===
Metamaucum was one of the earliest settlements in the Lagoon of Venice. Its origins dated back to the Roman days. It became the second ducal seat of the duchy of Venetia (before the rise of Venice) when Teodato Ipato (742–755), the second doge, transferred it from Heraclea, to 811, when the doge Agnello Participazio (811–827) moved it to Rivoalto. It was temporarily occupied by Pepin of Italy when he tried to invade the lagoon in 810. It was destroyed by the doge Giovanni I Participazio (829–836) when he suppressed a rebellion based in Metamaucum. The settlement continued to be inhabited, but it was a shadow of its former self. Its decadence reached its peak when its priory was moved to the island of Murano (1080), the S.S. Leone e Basso nuns moved to the island of San Servolo (1109) and its diocese was moved to Chioggia between 1107 and 1110. In 1116 it was submerged as a result of an exceptional storm surge. According to the tradition, Metamaucum was on the seashore of the Lido island, rather than on its lagoon shore.

A new settlement was built on the lagoon shore of Lido, close to where Metamaucum had been. The existence of a Metamaucum Nova, which corresponds to today&#x27;s Malamocco, was first attested in 1107.

===Military island===
Until the 19th century Lido&#x27;s main role was a military one for the defence of the lagoon as it lies by the lido inlet, the widest point of entry of the lagoon and the one which is closest to Venice. It continued to have a military role until WW II. Prior to the 19th century it was also a scarcely populated island. In 1820 Lido has 814 inhabitants, 662 of whom lived in Malamocco, and 152 lived in San Nicolò.

In 600 a lookout tower was built at San Nicolò, at the northern end of Lido, on its lagoon side shore, to monitor enemy ships, particularly pirate ships, approaching the lagoon at the Lido inlet. In 1100 it was strengthened and developed into a fort under the doge Vitale I Michiel (1096-1102). This fort was later called Castel Vecchio (Old Castle).

In 1229 crossbow shooting ranges were created in areas of Venice for weekly exercises by men between the ages of 16 and 35. In 1229 a shooting range was established at San Nicolò. It hosted shooting contests at Christmas and Easter to make the exercises more interesting. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery units were also stationed in the area and foundries for armaments and munitions were built where the Jewish cemetery was later set up. In 1304 a militia was instituted. The sailing to Lido was also turned into a contest. The men rowed to the island on boats (called ganzaruoli) with 30-40 oarsmen boats which competed over who would get there first. This is the origin of the word regatta. The only establishment that sold wine at San Nicolò was closed during the contests. A lighthouse was also built close to the shooting range. A permanent garrison was set up. It served as rest area for troops which needed to briefly stop by. Wells to supply freshwater to ships that left the city were built.

In the mid-14th century tensions between Venice and the Republic of Genoa escalated due to their rivalry over supremacy of the naval routes and trading ports in the eastern Mediterranean . 1318. San Nicolò was bombed several times by a Genoese fleet.

In 1335 the Gagiandra (turtle in Venetian) was built. It was a platform for artillery which was placed in the Lido channel which went from the Lido inlet to Venice. It was broad and tapered at the stern and bow. It was covered by a metal plate which acted as a shield. The canons were sticking out of this shield. This gave it the appearance of the head, tail and legs of a turtle. The platform was placed between the Castel Vecchio (Old Castle) at San Nicolò and the Castel Novo (New Castle) on the Vignole island. These two islands and the island of Certosa formed the shores of the channel. An iron chain was placed across the channel. It was supported by the Gagiandra and two rafts placed midway between the &quot;turtle&quot; and the two shores. The chain was kept close to the surface of the water to prevent enemy ships to pass above it.

In 1379 Genoa attacked the lagoon in the War of Chioggia (1379–80). Two towers were built as platforms for crossbows and cannons at the Castel Vecchio and Novo forts (on the Lido and Vignole islands) on the two sides of the Lido channel, to further protect the entrance to the lagoon. Small boats which were chained together were placed between the two towers. Between them there were three ships with archers covered with fresh hides to protect them from fire. A ditch and earthen rampant strengthened with stone were created to protect the S. Nicoló abbey. Eventually Venice won the war.

In 1409 an admiralty was established at S. Nicolò. 1520 The Council of Ten build a building to house its offices and barracks for its officers who were entrusted with monitoring Lido, its fortresses, its inlet and the way the sea changed its beaches. This was called the Casa Rossa (Red House).
In the 16th century, with the Turkish conquests in south-eastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, which were a threat to the Venetian dominion in that part of the Mediterranean the Turks were also considered a threat to Venice itself.

Between 1543 and 1549 Castel Novo, on the Vignole island, was developed into the Sant’Andrea fort. Between 1546 and 1574 Castel Novo at San Nicolò was developed into the San Nicolò fort. Between 1569 and 1574 the latter was strengthened with a triple ditch. Artillery was placed on the seaward side. There were no batteries on the lagoon side in case the fortress was seized and the cannons would be used against the Sant’Andrea fort. The fort became a complex with the military headquarter of the Republic of Venice. The whole area became a c. 521 m long fortified citadel stretching along the lagoon coast with brick barriers and bastions, a dike and an earthen fore wall. It was later extended towards the sea with angular barriers, six gates and underground exits on the sea beach side, towards the entrance to the Lido inlet. Inside the new fortification there were the old San Nicolò church and its convent and the adjacent Palazzo dei dieci/Casa Rossa at the back. In 1572 an Istrian stone bridge that looked like a triumphal arch over the dock was built to provide access to the citadel.

Large barracks for the troops, known as Saraglio, Quartier Grando or Palazzo dei Soldati (Stronghold, Large Quarters or Building of the Soldiers) were built between 1591 and 1594. It was an imposing building which provided lodgings for 2000 soldiers. It was the first true barracks in Europe, the first instance in which troops were lodged in peacetime. It was an important step towards the creation of a modern army as opposed to a mercenary army or a militia. It was built on the location where the crusaders had gathered before setting off for the fourth crusade. From 1600 the barracks hosted the Fanti da Mar (Infantrymen of the Sea), the first amphibian troops in history, a sort of precursor of today&#x27;s marines.

In 1571 it was decided to build octagonal forts for artillery batteries on islets off the lagoon side shore of Lido. They were the Ottagono Campana (later called Abbandonato, abandoned octagon), between Malamocco and Alberoni (off the southern end of the Lido island) and the Ottagono Alberoni, by Alberoni and the northern end of the Malamocco inlet, the other point of access into the lagoon, where ships could turn towards Venice. The Ottagono di Poveglia (further north, on the Poveglia island, off Malamocco) acted as a reinforcement for the other two octagons further south. Two octagons were built off the Pellestrina island, the Ottagono San Pietro, at the northern end of the island and the southern end of the Malamocco inlet and the Ottagono Caroman, at the southern end of Pellestrina to guard the Chioggia inlet, the third entry point of the lagoon. In 1572, 75 artillery were supplied for the San Nicolò fort and 56 for Sant’Andrea.

San Nicolò was also where the soldiers and the ships for Venice&#x27;s naval expeditions in the Adriatic Sea and the rest of the Mediterranean Sea gathered and set off from. Some of these were:

In 1000 the doge Pietro II Orseolo (991-1099) set off for a mission to Istria and Dalmatia which freed the northern Adriatic from the Narentine pirates. In 1099, 207 ships set off at the end of the first crusade to help the crusaders to consolidate their conquests. It defeated a fleet of their Genoese rivals off Rhodes. In 1124 a fleet sets off to free the King of Jerusalem who had been imprisoned in Tyre, Lebanon. It had 108 vessels, 40 galleys 40 supply ships and 28 ships with rams. It besieged and seized Tyre. In 1171 A fleet set off for a battle against the emperor Byzantine Emmanuel Kommenos who had the Venetians in Constantinople arrested. The fleet was defeated more by the plague that the Byzantines, who were joined by the rival maritime republics of Genoa and Pisa. In 1202 the crusaders of the fourth crusade gathered at Lido in preparation to be taken to the East by Venetian ships. In 1690 Francesco Morosini set off for a campaign in the Peloponnese. He was elected as doge while away. He was met at Lido by the abbot while the senators waited for him of the bucintoro, the ceremonial boat of the doge. In 1784 there was a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates.

===Pope, emperor and the Peace of Venice===
The emperor Frederick I, Barbarossa (reigned 1155–1190) conducted six military campaigns in Italy, which was under his Holy Roman Empire. Originally he wanted to confront the Norman Kingdom of Sicily in the south. However, his intervention in Italy was opposed by several Italian cities, particularly Milan, which he had partially destroyed during his second campaign. A dispute with Pope Alexander III (1159–1181) developed because Frederick endorsed antipope Victor IV, who had been elected in opposition to Alexander. Opposition against Frederick in northern Italy grew and the Lombard League, a league formed by several cities, fought him. Frederick was defeated at the Battle of Legnano in 1176. Preliminary peace negotiations took place at Anagni (the Peace of Anagni) in 1176. Negotiations involving all the concerned parties to reach a formal peace treaty took place in Venice where a conference was scheduled for July 1177. The doge Sebastiano Ziani (1172–1178) was to act as an intermediary.

The pope arrived in Venice on 10 May 1177. Negotiations with the Lombard League and the king of Sicily started but they were taking a hard stance. Frederick was not allowed to go to Venice and waited for news in Ravenna. A pro-Frederick faction in Venice encouraged Frederick to come to Venice in defiance of the veto, but the emperor declined to do so without the doge&#x27;s approval. Because of internal pressure, Ziani hesitated. The envoys of the League left Venice for Treviso in protest. The head of the Sicilian delegation threatened to leave and said that his king would take revenge on Venice breach of faith. This would have meant retaliation against Venetian traders in Sicily. The doge confirmed that Frederick would be allowed to enter Venice only after this received papal approval.

This situation highlighted the danger of a breakdown in the talks and negotiations proceeded more rapidly. On 23 July the agreement was completed. At the pope request, Venetian ships went to Chioggia to pick up the emperor, who was taken to Lido. Four cardinals went there to meet him there. Frederick recognised Alexander as the rightful pope and could now be allowed to enter Venice. Doge Ziani went to meet him at San Nicolò and took him to Venice with great pomp. A ceremony was held at St. Mark&#x27;s basilica.

===The Wedding to the Sea===
In 1000 the doge Pietro II Orseolo (991–1009) set off for a mission to Istria and Dalmatia which freed the northern Adriatic from the Narentine pirates. Istria and Dalmatia accepted Venice&#x27;s suzerainty. To celebrate this the Venetians celebrated with the (Blessing of the Sea) ceremony, which was held annually until 1177. In that year, after Venice&#x27;s mediation which led to the Peace of Venice, it was replaced by the (Wedding with the Sea).

In this ceremony the doge sailed for Lido on the bucintoro (the doge&#x27;s ceremonial ship) with the top clergy, the top officials of the Republic of Venice and ambassadors. This was followed by a large number of Venetians on various kinds of vessels. It was a festive parade. Between Lido and the Sant&#x27;Andrea fort (see above), where the Lagoon of Venice meets the Adriatic Sea, the doge took a golden ring which pope Alexander III had donated him. He then threw it into the sea. It was attached to a string so that it can be retrieved. The doge then recited &quot;We marry thee, oh sea, in a sign of eternal domination.&quot; The ceremony ended in 1797 when the Republic fell with its conquest by Napoleon. It was performed on the first Sunday after Ascension Day.

The ceremony and fête was performed again in 1965 and in 1988. The latter was an initiative by private citizens and cultural and sport associations which wanted to relaunch the celebrations. The ceremony became permanent and is now led by the mayor of Venice

The ceremony was also associated with the Feast of the Ascension. In 1180 it developed into the (Fair of the Ascension). There were acrobats, jugglers and minstrels in all the streets of Venice. There was a large market in St. Mark&#x27;s Square. From 1307 the market had especially prepared stands which over time became increasingly decoratively elaborate. Goods of all kinds and from all over the world were displayed.

===Murazzi===
The engineer Bernardo Zendrini found that pozzolana mixed with chalk and sand was an efficient water-resistant binder. In 1737 he built a 2.5 m long test wall near Malamocco. Three years later it had withstood two winter storm surges (one of which had been one of the worst) without damage. This led to the building of the murazzi, imposing walls made with large blocks of Istrian stone to form a continuous sea defence on the barrier island of Pellestrina. Later murazzi were built at Lido as well, but here they were discontinuous. A previously unknown 350 m long test wall was brought to light by the seaward shore in 1980. It lies 380 m from the sea. This is because after the construction of the breakwater at San Nicolò (see below), sand has been accumulating on the sea shore in the northern part of the island, widening the beach.

===Churches, monasteries convents and saints===
In 887 the male Benedictine monastery of San Cipriano was founded in Malamocco on the initiative of doge Giovanni II Participazio. This was followed by the female monastery of Santi Leone and Basso. In 1108 San Cipriano was abandoned due to damage caused by the sea and daily ground collapses. The friars moved to the Murano island and set up a new monastery of S. Cipriano. In 1109, for the same reason, the nuns moved to a convent on the San Servolo island vacated by Benedictine monks who had moved to the monastery of Sant&#x27;Ilario near Fusina.

In 1045 the doge Domenico Contarini I (1043–1071), the Patriarch of Grado and the bishop of Olivolo founded the church and convent of San Nicolò. The works for the church were completed in 1064. In 1053, the management of the church and convent was handed to the abbot of the Benedictine monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore. In 1098 some of relics three of saints from Myra (now Demre), west of the Chelidonia cape, Lydia, on the southern coast of what is now Turkey, were smuggled by a naval squadron which returned form the first crusade and placed in the San Nicolò church. The saints were Nicolò Major, his uncle Nicolò Minor and Theodoros. The church, which was small, was enlarged in 1134 and urns with the relics were moved from the crypt and put in three niches by the main altar. Between 1626 and 1634 the church was demolished and rebuilt, together with the bell tower, using material from the old church. In 1770 the Benedictines moved to San Giorgio Maggiore island because a 1768 law closed confraternities with fewer than 12 monks or friars. The building became a military quarter. The church remained open for worship. In 1938 it was granted to Franciscan friars.

The first record of the Abbey of San Leonardo between Alberoni and Malamocco dates to 1111. It was destroyed by fire, along with the whole of the Malamocco coast, during the War of Chioggia (1379–80). In 1407 there was a bequest for the rebuilding of the monastery. The church was rebuilt with funds from the patriarch of Venice. The church merged with the San Camillo hospital in 1928 and was demolished to enlarge the hospital.

In 1557 the parish church of Santa Maria Assunta church in Malamocco was rebuilt on top of old one, which dated to the 11th century.

In 1620 there was a request to build a church at Lido to replace the unauthorised oratory of Beata Vergine Visitante Santa Elisabetta (Blessed Visiting Virgin St. Elizabeth) to the south of San Nicolò, which was built by the locals because they found it difficult to reach their parish church of San Pietro di Castello on the island with the same name. In 1627 the construction of the new church, now called Santa Maria Elisabetta, on top of the old oratory was completed. The patriarch of Venice granted it the title of parish church. It was the second parish church of Lido, after Santa Maria Assunta in Malamocco. In the 19th century, when the area became built up, it was named after this church.

===Jewish and Protestant cemeteries===
In 1386 the Jews were granted a plot of uncultivated land to develop the Jewish cemetery. The friars of the San Nicolò convent were opposed to this and claimed that they owned the land. A few years later to resolve this, the Jews paid a token rent. Consent was given and burials started in 1389. A Protestant cemetery was opened close to the Jewish one in 1674. A very small Catholic cemetery was opened in 1866 in front of the entrance of the Jewish one. In 1916 it was replaced by a new one. A new Jewish cemetery was also built. Its monumental entrance was completed in 1923. As a result, the Catholic cemetery lies between the old and new Jewish cemeteries.

===19th century===
The accumulation of sand carried by the sea at the Malamocco and Lido inlets made their navigability problematic. During second Napoleonic occupation (1806–1814), it was decided to build breakwaters on the southern and northern shore of the Malamocco inlet. The latter was to be built at Alberoni, on the southern tip of Lido. However, the works were not completed due to the second Austrian occupation (1814–1848). The Austrians disagreed with the French plans. The project was entrusted to the engineer Pietro Paleocapa. Works at Alberoni started in 1838 and were completed in 1845. Works on the southern breakwater at Santa Maria del Mare, on the Pellestrina island, started in 1853 and were completed in 1856. The object of the northern breakwater to keep the coastal current at bay and trap the sand it carried. That of the southern one was to channel the receding low tide water to make the inlet deeper through the force of the exit current.

In the late 18th century and in the 19th century, a number of poets and writers wrote about Lido. This made Lido an attractive destination for people from the European elites in their then fashionable journeys in Italy. In 1786 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the German poet and scientist, visited Lido and wrote about his experience there in this book about his journey in Italy. Lord Byron spent five years (1816–1821) in Venice and liked to ride his horses at Lido from a hut he rented at Alberoni. In 1818 he was visited by Percy Bysshe Shelley. The two spent a couple of days at Lido. Shelley wrote a poem about this. Since Byron was a celebrity, this attracted tourists who hoped to meet the poet or get a glimpse of him at Lido. In 1830 James Fenimore Cooper, the author of &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, visited and described Lido and used Venice as the background for his novel &quot;The Bravo&quot;. In 1841 John Ruskin, the art critic who wrote about Venice and her art, also wrote about Lido. Other people who visited Lido and described it were and the French poet Theophile Gautier, in 1850, Herman Melville, the American novelist and poet, in 1857, and Hyppolyte Taine, the French critic and historian, in 1864. Henry James first arrived in Venice in 1869. He went to Lido 14 times. He wrote about Venice in some of his novels and one of them was set in Venice. The British poet and playwright Robert Browning went to Lido in 1888 and died in Venice nearly two months later.

Frederick William, the Duke of Brunswick (1771–1815) bought a plot of land at Lido, intending it to have his holiday home there. From 1879 queen Margherita of Savoy took her sickly son Victor Emmanuel III, the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Italy on holiday at Lido, at the sea bathing facility of La Favorita. A royal chalet was arranged for her. In those days there was the belief that sea bathing had a curative or therapeutic value.

Tommaso Rima, a doctor at Venice&#x27;s hospital, believed that bathing in the lagoon had therapeutic benefits for nervous illnesses, scrofula, rickets and skin disorders. In 1833 he set up a floating bathing facility at Punta della Dogana, opposite St Mark&#x27;s. It consisted of two big rafts which created a pool with a grate at the bottom and which could be reassembled in the summer. There was a café and one could sunbathe. The idea of bathing therapy caught on. Gondolas were adapted for the purpose and inns set up pools with water drawn for the nearby canals which was warmed up. There was an idea that this kind of bathing in the Venetian winter was particularly therapeutic. In 1857 a booklet about this notion published.

The Lido&#x27;s potential for tourism did not go unnoticed. In 1852 there was a proposal to set up two spas, one on the lagoon shore and one on the sea shore, but it was then thought that the lagoon water was less pure. In 1855 De la Hante, a Frenchman, set up a bathing resort in the La Favorita area, which was named after the villa of the archduke Maximillian of Austria (1832–1867) the brother of the emperor who was in charge of the Austrian dominions in northern Italy (1815–1859) and spent some of his time in Venice. The resort had 70 rooms. In 1872 De la Hante bought the archduke&#x27;s villa to convert it into a restaurant, café, casino and 70 rooms for an exclusive beach resort. However, he then sold it to the Lido Bathing Resort Society (see below).

In 1857 Giovanni Busetto, nicknamed Fisola, also opened a seaside resort. This consisted of wooden cabins on pilings over the beach with a common central area and two wings with 15 small rooms each. Separate cabins for the lower classes were planned. It was demolished by the Austrians in 1859 due to the Second Italian War of Independence against Austrian domination in northern Italy. In 1867, after Venice became part of Italy, the resort was reopened and expanded but was destroyed by a storm surge. It was reopened and expanded again in 1870. From 1867 to 1871 the number of bathers increased from 30 to 60 thousand.

In 1857 a summer shuttle service to and from Venice was set up. It consisted of large boats with four oarsmen which could carry 16 passengers. In 1858 the road from the church of Santa Maria Elisabetta, which was by the landing stage in the lagoon coast and lead to the seacoast, was widened and made suitable for vehicle traffic. It eventually came to be called Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (or just Gran Viale). It was widened again in 1888 and a horse-drawn omnibus which took tourists to the beach along the Gran Viale entered into service. In the same year the military steamship Alnoch, which could carry up to 200 passengers, was made available for linking Lido with Venice during the tourist season from 6 am to 9 pm. This was then extended to 4 am to 11 pm.

In 1872 a group of entrepreneurs set up the (the Lido Bathing Resort Society). Its aim was to boost Lido&#x27;s tourism potential. It bought the La Favorita villa, it reduced the number of its room to six to be used by queen Margaret. A large terrace which overlooked the sea was built. It could host 1500 people and had salons, café-restaurants, reading rooms and ballrooms, a telegraph and post office, medical assistance, a chemist and life guards with special lookout posts and boats. The group also wanted to promote sea bathing as a leisure activity as well as a therapeutic one. This idea was expounded by Paolo Mantegazza, a doctor who wrote about beaches and the sea as collective salons where people could rest and have fun.

The group planned more resorts and the urban development of the area between the landing stage of the lagoon side and the sea beach. This area came to be called Santa Maria Elisabetta. The project involved substantial land improvements and drainage on an island which was still largely rural and had areas of bog land and scattered dunes. A water drainage and sewer system was developed. The development was to have hospitality and entertainment facilities, residential areas, roads, gardens, woods, restaurants and cafes. Villas for wealthy bathers were built in Liberty style, the Italian version of Art Nouveau. The number of bathers increased from 60,000 in 1871 to 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.The number of small rooms for bathers increased to 600. They were equipped with facilities for seawater therapy with the spraying of rarefied water with compressed air.

In 1873 a steam navigation company was established. This was the birth of the Venetian waterbus, the service for the transport of people around the lagoon. It used steamboats which were smaller than the military one which had been used and thus allowed more frequent journeys. With regard to Lido, compared to oar boats, it shortened the time needed to reach Santa Maria Elisabetta from San Zaccaria (near St Mark&#x27;s Square) dramatically, from one hour to ten minutes. In 1881 a regular time table with services every half an hour between 6 am and 12 pm was introduced. It entered into operation in 1882. In 1898 the Municipality of Venice took over the Grand Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta and widened it to 17 m to allow for a single-track horse-drawn tramway. The Bathing Resort Society was given permission to set this up in 1889 s up. It replaced the omnibus.

In 1885 a low-cost bathing resort for the lower classes with 150 small rooms was established. In 1887 and 1888 the bathing resort was expanded again and an electricity power plant was built. The first beach huts were installed for bathing and for &quot;air, sunlight and sand&quot; therapy, which was popular among families. This development required the construction of a seafront boulevard. Further urbanisation took place and more villas were built. In 1889 an electric tramway line along the Gran Viale was introduced and from 1892 the Gran Viale had electric lighting during the tourist season. The number of tourists increased from 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.

The (Sea Nursing Home) opened in 1870. It was a hospital for poor children who suffered from scrofulosis, which affected especially children form deprived backgrounds, who needed heliotherapy. Experiments conducted in 1842 indicated that what was then called sea therapy was the required treatment. The hospital had 200 beds. It was expanded to 500 beds in 1873. After the opening of the Excelsior Hotel in 1908 it was planned to move the hospital elsewhere to make room next to the hotel and to move the sick away from it. This occurred in the 1920s.

The Lido inlet had not been used for navigation since 1724 because it was prevented by frequent sand accumulation. In 1866 the engineer Pietro Paleocapa submitted a plan to build two breakwaters to reopen the inlet, one on its northern shore (Punta Sabbioni) and the other on its southern shore (San Nicolò). They were to be 3.5 km and 2.85 km long respectively, extend in the direction of the Scirocco wind, give the inlet a width of 1 km and reach a depth of 8 m. In 1870 studies showed that similar works on the Malamocco inlet had been effective in preventing sand accumulation and that the sand was stopped by the northern breakwater. It accumulated by it. The project was approved in 1871. The works started in 1882. The San Nicolò breakwater was the first that was built. The works on both was completed in 1910 with the construction of a 26 m high lighthouse at Punta Sabbioni.

A theatre () with 600 seats opened in 1892. A velodrome was opened in 1894, but cycling competitions were ended in 1896 due to high running costs. In 1911 it hosted a period costume equestrian tournament which attracted a big crowd.

===20th century===
The expansion of the bathing resorts and of the urbanisation of the Santa Maria Elisabetta area continued. From 1900 to 1920 some 50 villas were built. In 1904 a horse-riding school was established. Over the decades it held several international contests and two world cups. The planning for a boulevard to connect Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta to San Nicolò started in 1905. An aquarium was opened next to the theatre in 1909. Both were later demolished.

Lido also became an island of grand hotels. The Grand Hotel Lido, in Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta, the square in front of the landing stage, was opened in 1900. It was demolished in the 1970s. In the same year the famous Grand Hotel des Bains was opened. The Hungaria Palace Hotel, later called Grand Hotel Ausonia &amp; Hungaria, opened in 1907. It had 82 rooms furnished by Eugenio Quarti, a famous Milan furniture maker nicknamed prince of the &quot;ebanisti&quot; (carpenters who work with ebony). A maiolica mosaic with Renaissance motifs interpreted in liberty style 
which made the hotel very distinctive was installed on its facade between 1914 and 1916. The Hotel Palace Excelsior opened in 1908.

In 1905 Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta was widened again, to 27 m, to accommodate two tracks for an electric tramway.

In 1911, in an era when flying was new, a show of short flights which landed on the beach of the Hotel Excelsior was organised. Two flights from Venice to this beach were arranged later in the year. The last one attracted many people who paid tickets to get on the terrace of the hotel and crowded it. There was a lottery draw whose prize was a tour on the plane. More such flights were then organised. This helped to attract attention to the hotel. In 1914 the owner of the Excelsior opened a fun fair which was extremely successful. However, it was dismantled the next year because of WW I. Another one was opened in 1932 but it suffered the same fate because of WW II.

In 1919 work started on a staircase to a votive temple (built between 1925 and 1928) dedicated to the Madonna of Victory and built for the remembrance of the fallen soldiers of WW I. The bodies of 3700 soldiers are kept here.

In the 1920s seaplanes became the next technological advance. A Frenchman organised an international competition, the Schneider International Cup, from 1920 to 1931. It was held at Lido in 1920, 1921 and 1927. It was extremely popular.

In 1919 it was decided that the &quot;Ospizio Marino&quot; (see above) was to remain open permanently and not just in the summer. Between 1922 and 1926 a new site for the hospital was built in the La Favorita area. It was now opened to adults as well. The centre for rehabilitation for children with rickets merged with this hospital in 1924. The Ospizio developed balneotherapy (bathing therapy) psammotherapy (hot sand baths) and sun therapy. In 1933 it was renamed &quot;Ospedale al Mare&quot; (Hospital at the Sea). It became a hospital of specialised excellence and the foremost thalassotherapy (the use of seawater for therapy) centre in Italy. In 1933 a church was opened in this complex.

In 1920 the Grand Hotel Company (CIGA) built a bagno popolare (low-cost bathing resort) and gave the municipality a large square to create a public playground. In 1923 another bagno popolare (later called zone A) was established next to the Ospizio Marino.

The Nicelli airport was developed during WWI for the defence of Venice. In 1926 it was converted to civilian use with the construction of a terminal. The first light was to Vienna and carried four passengers. By 1931 there were six routes. In 1935 a second terminal was built. By 1939 there were 23,285 passengers. The major European airlines operated here and the airport was the second most important one in Italy after Rome. During WW II much of its equipment was confiscated by the Germans, who also tried to destroy it. Operations resumed after the war. However, with the advent of bigger jet planes, the runway became too short. In 1961 the new Venice Marco Polo Airport was opened. The Nicelli airport only handled small private planes and hosted a school for pilots and parachutists. In 1994 the municipality of Venice set up a management firm to the restore the airport and relaunch economic activity in the area.

In 1930 the golf course at Alberoni was inaugurated. It was said that Henry Ford had been disappointed that Lido did not have a golf course. The area at the southern end of the island, which had sand dunes (sand would provide good drainage), trees and a former military fort and stables was chosen. Originally it had 9 holes. It was extended to 18 holes in 1951. The course is 6 km long. It hosted Italian opens in 1955, 1960 and 1974.

On 15–16 June 1934 Hitler went to Venice to meet Mussolini. He stayed at the Grand Hotel in Venice and Mussolini stayed at the Grand Hotel Excelsior. The two men met at the golf club at Alberoni.

Venice was the first city in the world to have a publicly owned and regulated casino. It opened in 1638. However, it was closed in 1774. In 1938 the casino (Palazzo del Casinò) at Lido was opened. This marked the return of legal gambling in Venice. It became a summer casino in 1946, when a winter venue was opened in Venice in what is now Ca’ Vendramin Calergi, formerly the last residence of Richard Wagner, who died there. The Palazzo del Casinò at Lido was closed in the 1990s when a new casino was opened at Ca’ Noghera in the mainland.

In 1946 and 1947 a motor race was held at the Lido circuit to relaunch tourism. Tazio Nuvolari came third in the second race. Lido hosted the road cycling world championship in 1952 and track cycling world championship in 1962. In the latter year the ice rink was opened. Prior to that the rich skated at an inner terrace of the Excelsior Hotel and the non-rich skated at a small garden by the casino. 
In the 1960s, the improving post-war Italian economy created a real-estate boom in the island and many Venetians moved to Lido to benefit from its modern infrastructure.

=== 21st century ===
In 2014, aviator Francesco Fornabaio was killed in a plane crash at the &quot;Fly Venice&quot; air show at Lido di Venezia.

== Venice Film Festival ==

Lido di Venezia is home to the Venice International Film Festival (, &quot;International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the Venice Biennale&quot;). It is the world&#x27;s oldest film festival and one of the three most prestigious ones, together with the Cannes Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival. These are sometimes called the &quot;Big Three&quot;.

The film festival started in 1932. It was the idea of the then chair of the Venice Biennale who was worried about a decline in tourism at Lido due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and understood that cinema could help to alleviate this. It was successful. The prince Umberto di Savoia, Winston Churchill, Henry Ford and film stars such as Greta Garbo and Clark Gable attended. Forty films from six countries were shown on the terrace of the Excelsior hotel. No awards were given, but an audience referendum chose which films and performances were the most praiseworthy.

The second festival was held in 1934. It was meant to be a biennial event but it became annual because of the success of the first one. There were some 20 awards, but there was no jury. Premiers were shown, which increased the prestige of the festival. So did a scandal caused by a Gustav Machaty&#x27;s &quot;Ecstasy&quot; which showed scenes with a female nude, at a time when this was considered scandalous, which also launched the career of the actress Hedy Lammarr. This time the films were shown in the garden of the Excelsior hotel. In 1937 the venue of the festival was opened. It is the Palazzo del Cinema.

In 1939 the Fascist government imposed the assignation of the awards to two propaganda films, a fascist one and a Nazi one. Because of this the Americans boycotted the 1940 festival. The 1940, 1941 and 1942 editions are not listed as part of the festival because the government assumed total control of the screening of films and chose films from the Rome–Berlin axis. These festival were screened at two cinemas in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned. From 1943 to 1945 the festival was suspended because of the war. It resumed in 1946. However, the French wanted their new festival, the Cannes Film Festival, to start at the same time as he Venice one. After negotiations it was decided that Cannes would run in the spring and Venice would start later, in late August. In 1946 and 1947 the festival was held in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned, this time by the American army. In the latter year the screenings took place at the Doge&#x27;s Palace. The festival returned to the Lido in 1948. An arena for outdoors screenings was built outside the film hall. In 1949 the festival&#x27;s award, which was called International Great Prize of Venice, was renamed St. Mark&#x27;s Lion Prize. Later it was called the Golden Lion.

The Lido has also hosted numerous film-shoots. In 1971 the film &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (}}, directed by Luchino Visconti, starring Dirk Bogarde and Björn Andrésen, and based on &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, the novella published in 1912 by Thomas Mann, was screened. Both the novella and the film were set at Lido and the Grand Hotel des Bains, where Thomas Mann stayed with his wife and brother in the summer of 1911. The novella was also turned into the &quot;Death in Venice&quot; opera by Benjamin Britten (his last opera) in 1973 and into a ballet by John Neumeier in 2003.

==Legacy==
The term Lido, which originates from this island, forms the first part of the name of many seaside resorts in Italy and is used to refer to certain types of outdoor swimming pools, especially in Great Britain. It also the origin of the name &quot;Lido deck&quot; on a cruise ship.

In Thomas Mann&#x27;s 1912 novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, often considered one of his greatest works, the main character – Aschenbach – stays at the Grand Hotel des Bains in Lido.

<text>Ruth Marianna Handler (née Mosko; November 4, 1916 – April 27, 2002) was an American business magnate and inventor. She is best known for inventing the Barbie doll in 1959 and being co-founder of toy manufacturer Mattel with her husband Elliot, as well as serving as the company&#x27;s first president from 1945 to 1975.

The Handlers were forced to resign from Mattel in 1975 after the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the company for falsifying financial documents.

Handler was prominently characterized in the 2023 film &quot;Barbie&quot;.

==Early life==
Ruth Marianna Mosko was born on November 4, 1916 in Denver, Colorado, to Polish-Jewish immigrants Jacob Moskowicz, a blacksmith and Ida Moskowicz (née-Rubenstein). She was the youngest of ten children. When she was six months old, her parents sent her to live with her older sister Sarah. She stayed with Sarah until she was 19 and developed an enthusiasm for business by working at Sarah’s drugstore/soda fountain.

In 1932, Ruth fell in love with Izzy Handler, an art student. The summer of her sophomore year at University of Denver, she went to Los Angeles and landed a job at Paramount Studio. Ruth and Izzy married in 1938 in Denver. Returning to California, Ruth encouraged her husband to become known by his middle name, Elliot. Ruth returned to work at Paramount and Elliot was employed as a lighting fixture designer.

==Mattel ==
Elliot became interested in furniture-making and decided to make furniture from two plastics, Lucite and Plexiglas. At Ruth&#x27;s suggestion, they started a furniture business where Ruth was in charge of sales, and she landed contracts with businesses such as Douglas Aircraft Company.

Business executive Harold &quot;Matt&quot; Matson joined the Handlers&#x27; company, which they renamed Mattel by combining &quot;Matson&quot; and &quot;Elliot&quot;. (Elliot later said that they were unable to think of a way to include Ruth&#x27;s name.) When sales fell during World War II, Mattel began making toy furniture. Its success spurred the company&#x27;s transition to toy manufacturing.

===Barbie===
Observing her daughter Barbara and friends having fun with paper dolls and role-play adult scenarios, Ruth noticed a market void. Dolls available at that time were mainly babies and toddlers; no dolls were available that resembled adults.

During a trip to Europe in 1956 with Barbara and her son Kenneth, Ruth came across Bild Lilli, a German doll. In an interview with Mary G. Lord, author of &quot;Forever Barbie,&quot; Handler said that she saw the doll in Lucerne, Switzerland. However, the book points out that on other occasions Handler said that she saw it in Zürich or Vienna. The adult-figured doll was exactly what Ruth had in mind. She purchased three, gave one to her daughter, and took the others to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character in a satirical comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper &quot;Bild.&quot; The Lilli doll was first sold in 1955 in Germany, and although initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing it in outfits that were available separately.

On return to the US, Handler redesigned the doll with help from local inventor-designer Jack Ryan. She named the doll Barbie after her daughter Barbara, and said that Barbie was from Willows, Wisconsin. Premiering on March 9, 1959 at the American International Toy Fair in New York City, the first Barbie doll cost $3 and was an instant hit. In its first year, 300,000 were sold. 

The Handlers and Mattel later added a boyfriend for Barbie, named Ken after the Handlers&#x27; son. Eventually a huge range of Barbie dolls was released, portrayed with more than 125 careers, and Barbie became known for her versatility and fashion. The Handlers added cars, sports gear, clothes, and doll furniture to their Barbie products.

==Later years==
Handler was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1970. She had a modified radical mastectomy, which was often done at the time to combat the disease. She spent less time at Mattel to focus on improving her health. Her loss of self-esteem affected her leadership and she lost control of her business. In a 1980 interview, she said: &quot;When I conceived Barbie, I believed it was important to a little girl’s self-esteem to play with a doll that [had] breasts. Now I find it even more important to return that self-esteem to women who have lost theirs.”

Due to difficulties in finding a good breast prosthesis, Handler decided to make her own. With the help of new business partner Peyton Massey and under her new company, Ruthton Corp., she manufactured a more realistic version of a woman&#x27;s breast called Nearly Me, aiming to boost women&#x27;s confidence regardless of their health. The invention became quite popular; first lady Betty Ford was fitted for one after a mastectomy.

Handler received various awards for her philanthropy and business activities. She was chosen Woman of the Year in Business by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, inducted into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame by the Toy Manufacturers of America, received the Volunteer Achievement Award from the American Cancer Society and was the inaugural Woman of Distinction of the United Jewish Appeal.

Following several investigations into fraudulent financial reports, Handler resigned from Mattel in 1975. Investigations continued and she was charged with fraud and false reporting by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest and was fined $57,000 () and sentenced to 2,500 hours of community service. She blamed her illness for making her &quot;unfocused&quot; on her business.

Handler died on April 27, 2002 in California from complications during surgery for colon cancer. She was 85.

==Legacy==
Handler is portrayed in the 2023 film &quot;Barbie&quot; by actress Rhea Perlman. In the film, the ghost of an elderly Handler resides in an office on the 17th floor of Mattel&#x27;s El Segundo headquarters. There she meets the movie&#x27;s stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie). Later, while advising Barbie, Handler tells her about her creation and how it related to her daughter, Barbara. Barbie then takes the name &quot;Barbara Handler&quot; as her own. The film stirred a wave of media coverage of Handler.

<doc id="228771" wikidata="Q7762944" url="?curid=228771" title="The Second Mrs Tanqueray">
<text>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray is a problem play by Arthur Wing Pinero. It utilises the &quot;Woman with a past&quot; plot, popular in nineteenth century melodrama. The play was first produced in 1893 by the actor-manager George Alexander and despite causing some shock to his audiences by its scandalous subject it was a box-office success, and was revived in London and New York in many productions during the 20th century.

==Background and first performance==
The English dramatist Arthur Wing Pinero had won fame as a writer of farces and other comedies, including &quot;The Magistrate&quot; (1885), &quot;Dandy Dick&quot; (1887) and &quot;The Cabinet Minister&quot; (1890). Wishing to write about serious subjects, he wrote &quot;The Profligate&quot; (1889), in which past misdeeds come to haunt a seemingly respectable man. Pinero intended the central character to kill himself at the climax of the play, but the actor-manager John Hare persuaded him to tone down the ending to avoid alienating his respectable society audience.

When his next such drama – &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; – came to be produced, Pinero remained firm: the play would, and did, end in tragedy. While he was planning it, several plays of Henrik Ibsen were presented in London for the first time, regarded by much of polite society as &quot;avant garde&quot;, blunt and shocking. Seeing &quot;Ghosts&quot; led Pinero to reconsider his approach to playwriting, which now seemed old-fashioned by comparison. He was far from uncritical of Ibsen&#x27;s plays, but recognised that if he was to be a serious dramatist he must treat social problems and human misconduct frankly.

&quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; centred on &quot;a woman with a past&quot;. Hare thought it too shocking for his audience and declined to present it. George Alexander, the actor-manager running the St James&#x27;s Theatre, to whom Pinero then offered the play, said, &quot;Sorry, I daren&#x27;t do it&quot;. He had second thoughts, and accepted it. It was presented at the St James&#x27;s on 27 May 1893. The cast was:

*Aubrey Tanqueray – George Alexander
*Sir George Orreyed, Bart – Adolphus Vane-Tempest
*Captain Hugh Ardale – Ben Webster
*Cayley Drummle – Cyril Maude (later Henry V. Esmond)
*Frank Misquith, QC, MP – Nutcombe Gould (later H. H. Vincent)
*Gordon Jayne, MD – Murray Hathorn
*Morse – Alfred Holles
*Lady Orreyed – Edith Chester
*Mrs Cortelyon – Amy Roselle (later Charlotte Granville)
*Paula – Mrs Patrick Campbell (later Charlotte Granville)
*Ellean – Maude Millett

::Source: &quot;The Era&quot;.

The piece was a box-office success and was still playing to full houses when Alexander, who disliked acting in long runs, closed the production in April 1894.

The play is referenced in Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s poem, &quot;Matilda&quot;, in &quot;Cautionary Tales for Children&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;It happened that a few Weeks later&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Her Aunt was off to the Theatre&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;To see that Interesting Play&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;She had refused to take her Niece&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;To hear this Entertaining Piece:&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A Deprivation Just and Wise&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;To Punish her for Telling Lies.&quot;

==Plot==
The play opens with a late night dinner between the widower Mr Tanqueray and some of his longtime professional friends. All are upper class members of British society, and the friends are disturbed when they learn of the forthcoming second marriage of Tanqueray to a Mrs Paula Jarman, a woman with a &quot;bad reputation&quot;.

As the play progresses we see the misery of the mismatched couple and their shared efforts to foster a bond between Tanqueray&#x27;s young and impeccably proper daughter Ellean and her young unhappy stepmother. This is compromised when Mrs Tanqueray learns the identity of her stepdaughter&#x27;s fiancé; he is the man who ruined her, years ago. She reveals her knowledge to her husband, who prevents the marriage and alienates his daughter. This spreads and husband and wife, father and daughter, step-parent and child are all angered and alienated. When the daughter learns the reasons behind her disappointment she is struck with pity and makes a speech about trying again with her stepmother, only to go to her and find her dead, evidently by suicide.

==Revivals and adaptations==
Madge Kendal and her husband W. H. Kendal took the play on tour in Britain, and then to Broadway where self-appointed guardians of morality condemned it, and audiences flocked to see it. There were London revivals in 1895 at the St James&#x27;s, 1901 at the Royalty Theatre, 1903 at the New Theatre, 1913 at the St James&#x27;s and 1922 at the Playhouse Theatre. Eleonora Duse appeared in an Italian adaptation in 1905, and the play was given in English in Paris in 1907 at the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt. The Internet Broadway Database records New York revivals in 1900, 1902, 1907, 1908, 1913 and 1924. More recently, the play has been revived in the West End with Eileen Herlie in the title role in 1950, and at the National Theatre in 1981, starring Felicity Kendal.

The play was adapted for the cinema in 1916, with Alexander in his original role. A later film version was released in 1952, with Pamela Brown as Paula and Hugh Sinclair as Tanqueray. The BBC has broadcast several radio adaptations of the play, starring Margaret Rawlings and Nicholas Hannen (1940), Coral Browne, Malcolm Keen and Jack Buchanan (1944), Joyce Redman and André Morell (1951), Gladys Cooper and André Morell (1954), Margaret Robertson and Tony Britton (1967) and Michelle Newell and Gary Bond (1992). A BBC television adaptation was broadcast in 1962, starring Elizabeth Sellars and Peter Williams.

<text>Heptameter is a type of meter where each line of verse contains seven metrical feet. It was used frequently in Classical prosody, and in English, the line was used frequently in narrative poetry since the Romantics. The meter is also called septenary, and this is the most common form for medieval Latin and vernacular verse, including the &quot;Ormulum&quot;. Its first use in English is possibly the &quot;Poema Morale&quot; of the twelfth/thirteenth century.

An example from Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Youth and Age&quot;:

:&#x27;Tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruin&#x27;d turret wreathe,
:All green and wildly fresh without, but worn and gray beneath.

:O could I feel as I have felt, or be what I have been,
:Or weep as I could once have wept o&#x27;er many a vanish&#x27;d scene,-
:As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish though they be,
:So midst the wither&#x27;d waste of life, those tears would flow to me!

An example from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;:

:It was many and many a year ago, In a kingdom by the sea,
:That a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of Annabel Lee;
:And this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me.

An example from Robert W. Service&#x27;s &quot;The Cremation of Sam McGee&quot;:

:Now Sam | McGee | was from Tenn|essee, | where the co|tton blooms | and blows.(A)
:Why he left his home in the South to roam &#x27;round the Pole, God only knows. (A)
: He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell; (B)
: Though he&#x27;d often say in his homely way that &quot;he&#x27;d sooner live in hell.&quot; (B)

<text>In natural languages, an indicative conditional is a conditional sentence such as &quot;If Leona is at home, she isn&#x27;t in Paris&quot;, whose grammatical form restricts it to discussing what could be true. Indicatives are typically defined in opposition to counterfactual conditionals, which have extra grammatical marking which allows them to discuss eventualities which are no longer possible.

Indicatives are a major topic of research in philosophy of language, philosophical logic, and linguistics. Open questions include which logical operation indicatives denote, how such denotations could be composed from their grammatical form, and the implications of those denotations for areas including metaphysics, psychology of reasoning, and philosophy of mathematics.

==Formal analyses==

Early analyses identified indicative conditionals with the logical operation known as the material conditional. According to the material conditional analysis, an indicative &quot;If A then B&quot; is true unless A is true and B is not. Although this analysis covers many observed cases, it misses some crucial properties of actual conditional speech and reasoning.

One problem for the material conditional analysis is that it allows indicatives to be true even when their antecedent and consequent are unrelated. For instance, the indicative &quot;If Paris is in France then trout are fish&quot; is intuitively strange since the location of Paris has nothing to do with the classification of trout. However, since its antecedent and the consequent are both true, the material conditional analysis treats it as a true statement. Similarly, the material conditional analysis treats conditionals with false antecedents as vacuously true. For instance, since Paris is not in Australia, the conditional &quot;If Paris is in Australia, then trout are fish&quot; would be treated as true on a material conditional analysis. These arguments have been taken to show that no truth-functional operator will suffice as a semantics for indicative conditionals. In the mid-20th century, work by H.P. Grice, Frank Cameron Jackson, and others attempted to maintain the material conditional as an analysis of indicatives&#x27; literal semantic denotation, while appealing to pragmatics in order to explain the apparent discrepancies.

Contemporary work in philosophical logic and formal semantics generally proposes alternative denotations for indicative conditionals. Proposed alternatives include analyses based on relevance logic, modal logic, probability theory, Kratzerian modal semantics, and dynamic semantics.

==Psychology==
Most behavioral experiments on conditionals in the psychology of reasoning have been carried out with indicative conditionals, causal conditionals, and counterfactual conditionals. People readily make the modus ponens inference, that is, given &quot;if A then B&quot;, and given &quot;A&quot;, they conclude &quot;B&quot;, but only about half of participants in experiments make the modus tollens inference, that is, given &quot;if A then B&quot;, and given &quot;not-B&quot;, only about half of participants conclude &quot;not-A&quot;, the remainder say that nothing follows (Evans &quot;et al.&quot;, 1993). When participants are given counterfactual conditionals, they make both the modus ponens and the modus tollens inferences (Byrne, 2005).

<doc id="228783" wikidata="Q204355" url="?curid=228783" title="Logical biconditional">
<text>In logic and mathematics, the logical biconditional, also known as material biconditional or equivalence or bidirectional implication or biimplication or bientailment, is the logical connective used to conjoin two statements formula_1 and formula_2 to form the statement &quot;formula_1 if and only if formula_2&quot; (often abbreviated as &quot;formula_1 iff formula_2&quot;), where formula_1 is known as the &quot;antecedent&quot;, and formula_2 the &quot;consequent&quot;. 

Nowadays, notations to represent equivalence include formula_9.

formula_10 is logically equivalent to both formula_11 and formula_12, and the XNOR (exclusive nor) Boolean operator, which means &quot;both or neither&quot;.

Semantically, the only case where a logical biconditional is different from a material conditional is the case where the hypothesis (antecedent) is false but the conclusion (consequent) is true. In this case, the result is true for the conditional, but false for the biconditional.

In the conceptual interpretation, means &quot;All &#x27;s are &#x27;s and all &#x27;s are &#x27;s&quot;. In other words, the sets and coincide: they are identical. However, this does not mean that and need to have the same meaning (e.g., could be &quot;equiangular trilateral&quot; and could be &quot;equilateral triangle&quot;). When phrased as a sentence, the antecedent is the &quot;subject&quot; and the consequent is the &quot;predicate&quot; of a universal affirmative proposition (e.g., in the phrase &quot;all men are mortal&quot;, &quot;men&quot; is the subject and &quot;mortal&quot; is the predicate).

In the propositional interpretation, formula_13 means that implies and implies ; in other words, the propositions are logically equivalent, in the sense that both are either jointly true or jointly false. Again, this does not mean that they need to have the same meaning, as could be &quot;the triangle ABC has two equal sides&quot; and could be &quot;the triangle ABC has two equal angles&quot;. In general, the antecedent is the &quot;premise&quot;, or the &quot;cause&quot;, and the consequent is the &quot;consequence&quot;. When an implication is translated by a &quot;hypothetical&quot; (or &quot;conditional&quot;) judgment, the antecedent is called the &quot;hypothesis&quot; (or the &quot;condition&quot;) and the consequent is called the &quot;thesis&quot;.

A common way of demonstrating a biconditional of the form formula_13 is to demonstrate that formula_15 and formula_16 separately (due to its equivalence to the conjunction of the two converse conditionals). Yet another way of demonstrating the same biconditional is by demonstrating that formula_15 and formula_18.

When both members of the biconditional are propositions, it can be separated into two conditionals, of which one is called a &quot;theorem&quot; and the other its &quot;reciprocal&quot;. Thus whenever a theorem and its reciprocal are true, we have a biconditional. A simple theorem gives rise to an implication, whose antecedent is the &quot;hypothesis&quot; and whose consequent is the &quot;thesis&quot; of the theorem.

It is often said that the hypothesis is the &quot;sufficient condition&quot; of the thesis, and that the thesis is the &quot;necessary condition&quot; of the hypothesis. That is, it is sufficient that the hypothesis be true for the thesis to be true, while it is necessary that the thesis be true if the hypothesis were true. When a theorem and its reciprocal are true, its hypothesis is said to be the necessary and sufficient condition of the thesis. That is, the hypothesis is both the cause and the consequence of the thesis at the same time.

==Notations==
Notations to represent equivalence used in history include: 
* formula_19 in George Boole in 1847. Although Boole used formula_19 mainly on classes, he also considered the case that formula_21 are propositions in formula_22, and at the time formula_19 is equivalence.
* formula_24 in Frege in 1879;
* formula_25 in Bernays in 1918;
* formula_26 in Hilbert in 1927 (while he used formula_25 as the main symbol in the article);
* formula_28 in Hilbert and Ackermann in 1928 (they also introduced formula_29 while they use formula_25 as the main symbol in the whole book; formula_28 is adopted by many followers such as Becker in 1933);
* formula_32 (prefix) in Łukasiewicz in 1929 and formula_2 (prefix) in Łukasiewicz in 1951; 
* formula_34 in Heyting in 1930;
* formula_35 in Bourbaki in 1954;
* formula_36 in Chazal in 1996; 

and so on. Somebody else also use formula_37 or formula_38 occasionally.

==Definition==

Logical equality (also known as biconditional) is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of &quot;true&quot; if and only if both operands are false or both operands are true.

===Truth table===
The following is a truth table for formula_39:


When more than two statements are involved, combining them with formula_28 might be ambiguous. For example, the statement

:formula_41

may be interpreted as

:formula_42,

or may be interpreted as saying that all are &quot;jointly true or jointly false&quot;:
:formula_43

As it turns out, these two statements are only the same when zero or two arguments are involved. In fact, the following truth tables only show the same bit pattern in the line with no argument and in the lines with two arguments:

The left Venn diagram below, and the lines &quot;(AB    )&quot; in these matrices represent the same operation.

===Venn diagrams===
Red areas stand for true (as in for &quot;and&quot;).

==Properties==
Commutativity: Yes
Associativity: Yes
Distributivity: Biconditional doesn&#x27;t distribute over any binary function (not even itself), but logical disjunction distributes over biconditional.

Idempotency: No
Monotonicity: No
Truth-preserving: Yes
When all inputs are true, the output is true.
Falsehood-preserving: No
When all inputs are false, the output is not false.
Walsh spectrum: (2,0,0,2)

Nonlinearity: 0 (the function is linear)

==Rules of inference==

Like all connectives in first-order logic, the biconditional has rules of inference that govern its use in formal proofs.

===Biconditional introduction===

Biconditional introduction allows one to infer that if B follows from A and A follows from B, then A if and only if B.

For example, from the statements &quot;if I&#x27;m breathing, then I&#x27;m alive&quot; and &quot;if I&#x27;m alive, then I&#x27;m breathing&quot;, it can be inferred that &quot;I&#x27;m breathing if and only if I&#x27;m alive&quot; or equivalently, &quot;I&#x27;m alive if and only if I&#x27;m breathing.&quot; Or more schematically:

 B → A   
 A → B   
 ∴ A ↔ B

 B → A   
 A → B   
 ∴ B ↔ A

===Biconditional elimination===
Biconditional elimination allows one to infer a conditional from a biconditional: if A B is true, then one may infer either A B, or B A.

For example, if it is true that I&#x27;m breathing if and only if I&#x27;m alive, then it&#x27;s true that &quot;if&quot; I&#x27;m breathing, then I&#x27;m alive; likewise, it&#x27;s true that &quot;if&quot; I&#x27;m alive, then I&#x27;m breathing. Or more schematically:

 A ↔ B  
 ∴ A → B

 A ↔ B  
 ∴ B → A

==Colloquial usage==

One unambiguous way of stating a biconditional in plain English is to adopt the form &quot;&quot;b&quot; if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; if &quot;b&quot;—if the standard form &quot;a&quot; if and only if &quot;b&quot; is not used. Slightly more formally, one could also say that &quot;b&quot; implies &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; implies &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;a&quot; is necessary and sufficient for &quot;b&quot;&quot;. The plain English &quot;if&#x27;&quot; may sometimes be used as a biconditional (especially in the context of a mathematical definition). In which case, one must take into consideration the surrounding context when interpreting these words.

For example, the statement &quot;I&#x27;ll buy you a new wallet if you need one&quot; may be interpreted as a biconditional, since the speaker doesn&#x27;t intend a valid outcome to be buying the wallet whether or not the wallet is needed (as in a conditional). However, &quot;it is cloudy if it is raining&quot; is generally not meant as a biconditional, since it can still be cloudy even if it is not raining.

<text>Ensamma mamman (&quot;single mom&quot;) is a Swedish comic strip created by Cecilia Torudd. &quot;Ensamma mamman&quot; first made a brief appearance in &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; in 1985. It was well received by the readers and returned in 1987 as a fixed feature. Torudd continued drawing it until 1991, when it was syndicated by Bull, and it has since been rerun in many newspapers. &quot;Ensamma mamman&quot; deals with a single mother and her two teenage children, her 14-year-old son Beppe and her daughter Mia, 17 years old. 

&quot;Ensamma mamman&quot; received the Urhunden Prize by the &quot;Swedish Association for Promotion of Comics&quot;, in 1989.

<text>climm (previously mICQ) is a free CLI-based instant messaging client that runs on a wide variety of platforms, including AmigaOS, BeOS, Windows (using either Cygwin or MinGW), OS X, NetBSD/OpenBSD/FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX.

== Functionality ==

climm has many of the features the official ICQ client has, and more:

* It has support for SSL-encrypted direct connection compatible with licq and SIM.
* It supports OTR encrypted messages.
* It is internationalized; German, English, and other translations are available, and it supports sending and receiving acknowledged and non-acknowledged Unicode-encoded messages (it even understands UTF-8 messages for message types the ICQ protocol does not use them for).
* It is capable of running several UINs at the same time and is very configurable (e.g. different colors for incoming messages from different contacts or for different accounts).
* Due to its command-line interface, it has good usability for blind users through text-to-speech interfaces or Braille devices. 

climm also supports basic functionality of the XMPP protocol.

== History ==
&quot;Climm&quot; was originally developed as &quot;mICQ&quot; by Matt D. Smith as public domain software. Starting with mICQ 0.4.8 it was licensed under the GPLv2, not much of the original PD code remained since then. All later additions were made by Rüdiger Kuhlmann, in particular, the support for the ICQ v8 protocol. mICQ was renamed to climm (&quot;Command Line Interface Multi Messenger&quot;) with version change to 0.6. CLimm was relicensed to include the OpenSSL exception.

<doc id="228796" wikidata="Q1064131" url="?curid=228796" title="Day trading">
<text>Day trading is a form of speculation in securities in which a trader buys and sells a financial instrument within the same trading day, so that all positions are closed before the market closes for the trading day to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price gaps between one day&#x27;s close and the next day&#x27;s price at the open. Traders who trade in this capacity are generally classified as speculators. Day trading contrasts with the long-term trades underlying buy-and-hold and value investing strategies. Day trading may require fast trade execution, sometimes as fast as milli-seconds in scalping, therefore direct-access day trading software is often needed.

Day trading is a strategy of buying and selling securities within the same trading day. According to FINRA, a &quot;day trade&quot; involves the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) of the same security on the same day in a margin account, covering a range of securities including options. An individual is considered a &quot;pattern day trader&quot; if they execute four or more day trades within five business days, given these trades make up over six percent of their total trades in the margin account during that period. Pattern day traders must adhere to specific margin requirements, notably maintaining a minimum equity of $25,000 in their trading account before engaging in day trading activities.

Day traders generally use leverage such as margin loans. In the United States, Regulation T permits an initial maximum leverage of 2:1, but many brokers will permit 4:1 intraday leverage as long as the leverage is reduced to 2:1 or less by the end of the trading day. In other countries margin rates of 30:1 or higher are available. In the United States, based on rules by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, people who make more than 3 day trades per 5-trading-day period are termed pattern day traders and are required to maintain $25,000 in equity in their accounts. However, a day trader with the legal minimum of $25,000 in their account can buy $100,000 (4× leverage) worth of stock during the day, as long as half of those positions are exited before the market close. Because of the high risk of margin use, and of other day trading practices, a day trader will often have to exit a losing position very quickly, in order to prevent a greater, unacceptable loss, or even a disastrous loss, much larger than their original investment, or even larger than their account value. Since margin interest is typically only charged on overnight balances, the trader may pay no interest fees for the margin loan, though still running the risk of margin calls. Margin interest rates are usually based on the broker&#x27;s call rate.

Some of the more commonly day-traded financial instruments are stocks, options, currency (including cryptocurrency), contracts for difference, and futures contracts such as stock market index futures, interest rate futures, currency futures and commodity futures. Some day traders use an intra-day technique known as scalping that has the trader holding a position briefly, for a few minutes to only seconds. 

Day trading was once an activity that was exclusive to financial firms and professional speculators. Many day traders are bank or investment firm employees working as specialists in equity investment and investment management. Day trading gained popularity after the deregulation of commissions in the United States in 1975, the advent of electronic trading platforms in the 1990s, and with the stock price volatility during the dot-com bubble. Recent 2020 pandemic lockdowns and following market volatility has caused a significant number of retail traders to enter the market.

Day traders may be professionals that work for large financial institutions, are trained by other professionals or mentors, do not use their own capital, or receive a base salary of approximately $50,000 to $70,000 as well as the possibility for bonuses of 10%–30% of the profits realized. Individuals can day trade with as little as $100, or even less, with fractional shares.

==History==

Before 1975, stockbrokerage commissions in the United States were fixed at 1% of the amount of the trade, i.e. to purchase $10,000 worth of stock cost the buyer $100 in commissions and same 1% to sell and traders had to make &quot;over&quot; 2% to cover their costs, which was not likely in a single trading day.

In 1975, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prohibited fixed commission rates, and commission rates dropped significantly.

Financial settlement periods used to be much longer. Before the early 1990s at the London Stock Exchange, for example, stock could be paid for up to 10 working days after it was bought, allowing traders to buy (or sell) shares at the beginning of a settlement period only to sell (or buy) them before the end of the period hoping for a rise in price. This activity was identical to modern day trading, but for the longer duration of the settlement period. But today, to reduce market risk, the settlement period is typically T+2 (two working days) and brokers usually require that funds be posted in advance of any trade. Reducing the settlement period reduces the likelihood of default, but was impossible before the advent of electronic ownership transfer.

===Electronic communication networks===
Electronic communication networks (ECNs), large proprietary computer networks on which brokers can list a certain amount of securities to sell at a certain price (the asking price or &quot;ask&quot;) or offer to buy a certain amount of securities at a certain price (the &quot;bid&quot;), first became a factor with the launch of Instinet in 1969. However, at first, they generally offered better pricing to large traders.

The next important step in facilitating day trading was the founding in 1971 of NASDAQ - a virtual stock exchange on which orders were transmitted electronically. Moving from paper share certificates and written share registers to &quot;dematerialized&quot; shares, traders used computerized trading and registration that required not only extensive changes to legislation but also the development of the necessary technology: online and real time systems rather than batch; electronic communications rather than the postal service, telex or the physical shipment of computer tapes, and the development of secure cryptographic algorithms.

These developments heralded the appearance of &quot;market makers&quot;: the NASDAQ equivalent of a NYSE specialist. A market maker has an inventory of stocks to buy and sell, and simultaneously offers to buy and sell the same stock. Obviously, it will offer to sell stock at a higher price than the price at which it offers to buy. This difference is known as the &quot;spread&quot;. The market maker is indifferent as to whether the stock goes up or down, it simply tries to constantly buy for less than it sells. A persistent trend in one direction will result in a loss for the market maker, but the strategy is overall positive (otherwise they would exit the business). Today there are about 500 firms who participate as market makers on ECNs, each generally making a market in four to forty different stocks. Without any legal obligations, market makers were free to offer smaller spreads on electronic communication networks than on the NASDAQ.

After Black Monday (1987), the SEC adopted &quot;Order Handling Rules&quot; which required market makers to publish their best bid and ask on the NASDAQ.

Another reform made was the &quot;Small-order execution system&quot;, or &quot;SOES&quot;, which required market makers to buy or sell, immediately, small orders (up to 1,000 shares) at the market maker&#x27;s listed bid or ask. The design of the system gave rise to arbitrage by a small group of traders known as the &quot;SOES bandits&quot;, who made sizable profits buying and selling small orders to market makers by anticipating price moves before they were reflected in the published inside bid/ask prices. The SOES system ultimately led to trading facilitated by software instead of market makers via ECNs.

In the late 1990s, existing ECNs began to offer their services to small investors. New ECNs arose, most importantly Archipelago (NYSE Arca) Instinet, SuperDot, and Island ECN. Archipelago eventually became a stock exchange and in 2005 was purchased by the NYSE. 

The ability for individuals to day trade via electronic trading platforms coincided with the extreme bull market in technological issues from 1997 to early 2000, known as the dot-com bubble. From 1997 to 2000, the NASDAQ rose from 1,200 to 5,000. Many naive investors with little market experience made huge profits buying these stocks in the morning and selling them in the afternoon, at 400% margin rates. An unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom and stories of people quitting their jobs to day trade were common.

In March 2000, this bubble burst, and many less-experienced day traders began to lose money as fast, or faster, than they had made during the buying frenzy. The NASDAQ crashed from 5000 back to 1200; many of the less-experienced traders went broke, although obviously it was possible to have made a fortune during that time by short selling or playing on volatility.

In parallel to stock trading, starting at the end of the 1990s, several new market maker firms provided foreign exchange and derivative day trading through electronic trading platforms. These allowed day traders to have instant access to decentralised markets such as forex and global markets through derivatives such as contracts for difference. Most of these firms were based in the UK and later in less restrictive jurisdictions, this was in part due to the regulations in the US prohibiting this type of over-the-counter trading. These firms typically provide trading on margin allowing day traders to take large position with relatively small capital, but with the associated increase in risk. The retail foreign exchange trading became popular to day trade due to its liquidity and the 24-hour nature of the market.

==Profitability and risks==
Because of the nature of financial leverage and the rapid returns that are possible, day trading results can range from extremely profitable to extremely unprofitable; high-risk profile traders can generate either huge percentage returns or huge percentage losses.
Day trading is risky, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has made the following warnings to day traders:
* Be prepared to suffer severe financial losses
* Day traders do not &quot;invest&quot;
* Day trading is an extremely stressful and expensive full-time job
* Day traders depend heavily on borrowing money or buying stocks on margin
* Don&#x27;t believe claims of easy profits
* Watch out for &quot;hot tips&quot; and &quot;expert advice&quot; from newsletters and websites catering to day traders
* Remember that &quot;educational&quot; seminars, classes, and books about day trading may not be objective
* Check out day trading firms with your state securities regulator

Most day traders lose money.

A 2019 research paper analyzed the performance of individual day traders in the Brazilian equity futures market. Based on trading records from 2012 to 2017, it was concluded that day trading Brazilian equity futures is almost uniformly unprofitable:
An article in &quot;Forbes&quot; quoting someone from an educational trading website stated that &quot;the success rate for day traders is estimated to be around only 10%, so ... 90% are losing money,&quot; adding &quot;only 1% of [day] traders &quot;really&quot; make money.&quot;

==Techniques==
Day trading requires a sound and rehearsed method to provide a statistical edge on each trade and should not be engaged on a whim. 

The following are several basic trading strategies by which day traders attempt to make profits. In addition, some day traders also use contrarian investing strategies (more commonly seen in algorithmic trading) to trade specifically against irrational behavior from day traders using the approaches below. It is important for a trader to remain flexible and adjust techniques to match changing market conditions.

Some of these approaches require short selling stocks; the trader borrows stock from their broker and sells the borrowed stock, hoping that the price will fall and they will be able to purchase the shares at a lower price, thus keeping the difference as their profit. There are several technical problems with short sales: the broker may not have shares to lend in a specific issue, the broker can call for the return of its shares at any time, and some restrictions are imposed in America by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on short-selling (see uptick rule for details). Some of these restrictions (in particular the uptick rule) don&#x27;t apply to trades of stocks that are actually shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF).

===Swing Trading===
Swing trading is a strategy aimed at gaining profit from stock price fluctuations over a period of several days to weeks. This method contrasts with day trading, where positions are closed within the same day. Swing traders utilize technical analysis to identify potential price movements and determine optimal trading moments.

===Trend following===
Trend following, or momentum trading, is a strategy used in all trading time-frames, assumes that financial instruments which have been rising steadily will continue to rise, and vice versa with falling. Traders can profit by buying an instrument which has been rising, or short selling a falling one, in the expectation that the trend will continue. These traders use technical analysis to identify trends.

As a Strategy for Day Trading, a robust trading strategy traditionally used for long-term investments in various asset classes, can also be adapted for day trading. This strategy, which benefits from identifying and leveraging market trends, involves clearly defined entry and exit points based on the prevailing market direction.

Szakmary and Lancaster (2015) validate the effectiveness of trend following in the U.S. stock market, demonstrating its potential for generating positive returns. Similarly, research by Blackstar Funds highlights rigorous applications of trend following in commodities, financial futures, and currencies, although its application to stock trading presented challenges.

For day traders, trend following requires rapid execution and diligent risk management, given the shorter time frame and higher transaction costs. Effective day trading using trend following strategies involves real-time trend analysis and the ability to quickly adjust to market changes.

===Contrarian investing===
Contrarian investing is a market timing strategy used in all trading time-frames. It assumes that financial instruments that have been rising steadily will reverse and start to fall, and vice versa. The contrarian trader buys an instrument which has been falling, or short-sells a rising one, in the expectation that the trend will change.

===Range trading===
Range trading, or range-bound trading, is a trading style in which stocks are watched that have either been rising off a support price or falling off a resistance price. That is, every time the stock hits a high, it falls back to the low, and vice versa. Such a stock is said to be &quot;trading in a range&quot;, which is the opposite of trending. The range trader therefore buys the stock at or near the low price, and sells (and possibly short sells) at the high. A related approach to range trading is looking for moves outside of an established range, called a breakout (price moves up) or a breakdown (price moves down), and assume that once the range has been broken prices will continue in that direction for some time.

===Scalping===
Scalping was originally referred to as spread trading. Scalping is a trading style where small price gaps created by the bid–ask spread are exploited by the speculator. It normally involves establishing and liquidating a position quickly, usually within minutes or even seconds.

Scalping highly liquid instruments for off-the-floor day traders involves taking quick profits while minimizing risk (loss exposure). It applies technical analysis concepts such as over/under-bought, support and resistance zones as well as trendline, trading channel to enter the market at key points and take quick profits from small moves. The basic idea of scalping is to exploit the inefficiency of the market when volatility increases and the trading range expands. Scalpers also use the &#x27;fade&#x27; technique, when stock values suddenly rise, they short sell securities that seem overvalued.

===Rebate trading===
Rebate trading is an equity trading style that uses ECN rebates as a primary source of profit and revenue. Most ECNs charge commissions to customers who want to have their orders filled immediately at the best prices available, but the ECNs &quot;pay&quot; commissions to buyers or sellers who &quot;add liquidity&quot; by placing limit orders that create &quot;market-making&quot; in a security. Rebate traders seek to make money from these rebates and will usually maximize their returns by trading low priced, high volume stocks. This enables them to trade more shares and contribute more liquidity with a set amount of capital, while limiting the risk that they will not be able to exit a position in the stock.

===Trading the news===
The basic strategy of trading the news is to buy a stock which has just announced good news, or short sell on bad news. Such events provide enormous volatility in a stock and therefore the greatest chance for quick profits (or losses). Determining whether news is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; must be determined by the price action of the stock, because the market reaction may not match the tone of the news itself. This is because rumors or estimates of the event (like those issued by market and industry analysts) will already have been circulated before the official release, causing prices to move in anticipation. The price movement caused by the official news will therefore be determined by how good the news is relative to the market&#x27;s expectations, not how good it is in absolute terms.

===Price action trading===
Price action trading relies on technical analysis but does not rely on conventional indicators. These traders rely on a combination of price movement, chart patterns, volume, and other raw market data to gauge whether or not they should take a trade. This is seen as a &quot;minimalist&quot; approach to trading but is not by any means easier than any other trading methodology. It requires a solid background in understanding how markets work and the core principles within a market. However, the benefit for this methodology is that it is effective in virtually any market (stocks, foreign exchange, futures, gold, oil, etc.).

===Market-neutral trading===
Market-neutral trading is a strategy that is designed to mitigate risk in which a trader takes a long position in one security and a short position in another security that is related.

===Algorithmic trading===
It is estimated that more than 75% of stock trades in United States are generated by algorithmic trading or high-frequency trading. The increased use of algorithms and quantitative techniques has led to more competition and smaller profits. Algorithmic trading is used by banks and hedge funds as well as retail traders. Retail traders can buy commercially available automated trading systems or develop their own automatic trading software.

==Cost==
===Commission===
Commissions for direct access trading, such as that offered by Interactive Brokers are calculated based on volume, and are usually 0.5 cents per share or $0.25 per futures contract. The more shares traded, the cheaper the commission. Most brokers in the United States, especially those that receive payment for order flow do not charge commissions.

===Spread===
The numerical difference between the bid and ask prices is referred to as the bid–ask spread. Most worldwide markets operate on a bid-ask-based system.

The ask prices are immediate execution (market) prices for quick buyers (ask takers) while bid prices are for quick sellers (bid takers). If a trade is executed at quoted prices, closing the trade immediately without queuing would always cause a loss because the bid price is always less than the ask price at any point in time. 

The bid–ask spread is two sides of the same coin. The spread can be viewed as trading bonuses or costs according to different parties and different strategies. On one hand, traders who do NOT wish to queue their order, instead paying the market price, pay the spreads (costs). On the other hand, traders who wish to queue and wait for execution receive the spreads (bonuses). Some day trading strategies attempt to capture the spread as additional, or even the only, profits for successful trades.

===Market data===
Market data is necessary for day traders to be competitive. A real-time data feed requires paying fees to the respective stock exchanges, usually combined with the broker&#x27;s charges; these fees are usually very low compared to the other costs of trading. The fees may be waived for promotional purposes or for customers meeting a minimum monthly volume of trades. Even a moderately active day trader can expect to meet these requirements, making the basic data feed essentially &quot;free&quot;. In addition to the raw market data, some traders purchase more advanced data feeds that include historical data and features such as scanning large numbers of stocks in the live market for unusual activity. Complicated analysis and charting software are other popular additions. These types of systems can cost from tens to hundreds of dollars per month to access.

<text>East Liberty Presbyterian Church, sometimes referred to as the Cathedral of Hope, is in the East Liberty neighborhood of the East End of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The current building is the fifth church building to occupy the site; the first was in 1819.

==History==
The congregation of the East Liberty Presbyterian Church was founded in 1819. The land on which the present church stands was donated by Jacob and Barbara Negley. An acre-and-a-half site, the congregation&#x27;s first building was a brick school and meeting house of forty-four square feet. The first pastor of the congregation was the Reverend W.B. McIlvaine, who was called as pastor in 1829. His ministry of four decades began with his ordination and installation in April 1830.

The pastorate of Rev. McIlvaine saw 622 members added to the church, spurring plans for a larger church building. In 1847 Mrs. Negley, now a widow, donated an additional tract of land that includes the current South Highland Avenue frontage. Three thousand dollars was raised and the second church, measuring 70 by 50 feet and seating about 400, was erected. The Pennsylvania Railroad extension into Pittsburgh in 1853 caused the Village of East Liberty&#x27;s population to grow. Eventually, the second church proved too small and discussions began again on the construction of a third building. The building of the third church was delayed by the Civil War, but in 1862, $13,000 was raised and the new church completed by 1864 at a total cost of $23,000.
In 1865, the church called an associate, the Rev. John Gillespie, a native of Scotland and graduate of the Western Theological Seminary. When Rev. McIlvaine retired in 1870, Gillespie assumed the role of pastor. Gillespie&#x27;s ministry lasted 12 years. In 1882, the Reverend Benjamin L. Agnew, of Philadelphia, was called to succeed Gillespie, but resigned after sixteen months to accept another call in Philadelphia. In 1884, the church called the Reverend J.P.E. Kumler, of Cincinnati. The congregation grew again under Kumler&#x27;s leadership and the congregation began to consider a fourth, and larger, church building. The fourth church was begun in 1887 and completed within a year.

In 1902, the Rev. Frank W. Sneed succeeded Kumler and served until 1920, when he resigned citing failing health. A vacancy of a year occurred until the Reverend Stuart Nye Hutchison was called as pastor in April 1921. In 1918, when the congregation observed its one-hundredth anniversary, Andrew William Mellon and Richard Beatty Mellon, the grandsons of Jacob and Barbara Negley donated to the East Liberty congregation the plot of land on Whitfield Street. This final donation of land brought the entire square of East Liberty&#x27;s center into church possession, which would later be filled with a fifth church, funded by Richard Beatty Mellon and Jennie King Mellon and in memory of their mothers.

==The present building==
The current church, designed by Ralph Adams Cram, is the fifth on its site. Construction began in 1931 and completed in 1935, funded entirely by Richard Beatty Mellon and his wife, Jennie King Mellon, in memory of their mothers, Sarah Jane Negley Mellon and Sarah Cordelia Smith King. Cram was most pleased with the result, calling it his Magnum Opus. Cram writes in 1935, &quot;Seldom in the case of great churches are the architects permitted to see their highest ideals carried out after a complete and definitive fashion. Here the donors had a vision of adequacy and completeness...it is doubtful if there is anywhere in this country a church of similar magnitude where every detail of utility and artistic quality has been achieved in so full a degree.&quot;

===Organs===
The original pipe organ in the church was also a gift of Richard Mellon and was built as Opus #884 by the Boston firm of Æolian-Skinner. The organ comprised eight divisions, including a six-rank string organ. It contained 6,944 pipes, a harp, and chimes. In 1972–73, the instrument was cleaned, and improvements were made to the blowers. Over the following two years, revoicing work was done on several reed and principal stops by J. David Burger. Additions in the 1970s included two significant Memorial Stops. The first being the State Trumpet and the second being the Mounted Cornet. In 2007, the Indianapolis organ building firm of Goulding &amp; Wood, Inc. installed a new organ composed of approximately 60% new pipework and 40% from the original organ. The instrument now contains 120 ranks, with restoration work still to be done on the two antiphonal divisions in the rear gallery.

The first organ in the chapel was built by the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, CT. This instrument had originally been installed in the fourth East Liberty building in 1919, a gift of Mrs. W.M. McKelvy, C. Lockhart McKelvy, and John E. McKelvy. The instrument consisted of sixty-three stops played by a four-manual console. By 1970, consideration was given whether to restore this instrument or purchase a new one. After much deliberation, a new pipe organ was purchased from the Austin Organ Company and installed in February 1973. The new, and current, Austin is a three manual instrument of 36 ranks and played by a three-manual console. Notably, the organ case predates the 1919 Austin organ and is likely that of the 1888 organ built by Frank Roosevelt for the East Liberty Presbyterian congregation.

=== Art and architecture ===
====Penn Avenue entrance====
The Penn Avenue main entrance carvings represent the City of God (left) and the Tower of David (right).

====Narthex====
The narthex ceiling is copied from a model found in Cambridge University, England. The inner doors from narthex to nave are English oak. The windows in the south wall depict angels holding instruments of praise and the Scriptures. The windows, from the studios of Reynolds, Francis and Rohnstock, form a glass screen between the narthex and the nave. Within them is found the following symbols: chrysanthemum, thistle, star, fleur-de-lis, rose, and finally a budded cross. Th rose window above the west entrance is also by Reynolds, Francis and Rohnstock. The two windows on the north side of the narthex are by Howard G. Wilbert. The exterior doors of the main entrance are English oak; the interior doors are Siamese teak and weigh four tons.

====Clerestory windows====
The windows of the clerestory are by Charles J. Connick of Boston, Massachusetts. There are ten clerestory windows in two groups. The windows on the east side of the nave depict Old Testament scenes while the windows on the west side depict New Testament scenes.

====Stained glass in the transepts====
The large rose window in the east transept, the two small rose windows above the chancel organ cases, and the two small rose windows in each transept are by the D&#x27;Ascenzo Studios of Philadelphia. The large window depicts the Revelation 21; the figure of a woman representing the Holy City, the New Jerusalem.

The American Presbyterian History Window was designed by Henry Lee Willett and touches on nearly three centuries of Presbyterian history. The portrayals include Frances Makemie, William Tennent, Samuel Davies, John Witherspoon, John Cameron Lowrie, David Brainerd, Sheldon Jackson, John Joyce, Samuel Findley, Charles Hodge, Thomas Jonathan Jackson, and Robert Elliott Speer. As of 2021, the Church is considering the removal of the Thomas Jonathan Jackson panel due to his Confederate infamy and affiliation. As of March 2023, the image of Stonewall Jackson has been removed from the American Presbyterian History Window. It has been replaced by deep blue glass.

A single lancet panel, beneath the American Presbyterian History Window, is by Oliver Smith Studios. This window shows three scenes: the Haystack Prayer Meeting (considered the beginning of American Foreign Missions), John Eliot (Puritan Missionary), and Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s Prayer in the Continental Congress.

====Sculpture in the transepts====
The Mellon coat-of-arms is mounted on the south wall of the east transept. A brief history of the East Liberty Presbyterian Church is also here inscribed, documenting the congregation&#x27;s gratitude to the Mellons for their gift of the building. Five Christian virtues are carved as symbols on the west wall of the east transept on shields: Charity (a sheep), Wisdom (a serpent), Faith (a chalice and cross), Chastity (a phoenix), and Patience (a yoked ox). The shield of the Presbyterian Church is carved on the east wall of the nave.

====Stained glass in the chancel====
The chancel windows were designed by Wilbur Herbert Burnham of Boston, Massachusetts. The windows depict scenes of the life of Christ from the entry into Jerusalem to the Ascension. These scenes are purposefully not placed chronologically so that they cannot be viewed within the sequence of events as found in Gospel accounts. Four small rose windows highlight the importance of music in worship and portray King David (Psalmist), Giovanni Pierluigi Palestrina, Pope Gregory I (Gregorian chant), and Johann Sebastian Bach.

====Sculpture in the chancel====
A &quot;sounding board&quot; is mounted above the pulpit, which served, prior to modern microphone and speaker systems, to project the preacher&#x27;s voice into the nave. The imposing reredos is constructed of Alabama limestone. The Last Supper, carved by John Angel, is regarded as one of the two outstanding achievements of his career (the other being the bronze doors of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City). The scene was carved from a twenty-two-ton rectangular block of Hauteville marble.

Elsewhere, the chancel features several types of marble. The red marble of the Communion Table was imported from Algeria. The chancel floor, formed into a geometrical design, is made of Hauteville marble from France, French Antique Rogue, Swiss Cipolin, Statuary White, Greek Verde Antique, Sarrancolin West, Campan Rubane, Red Levanto, Vermont Verde Antique and Swedish Green.

====The Tower Bell====
The central tower of the church is home to a bell cast by the Meneely Bell Foundry of Troy, NY. Weighing 2,760 pounds, it was donated by Barbara Negley in 1867. Its inscription reads: &quot;Donated to the First Presbyterian Church of East Liberty by Mrs. B. A. Negley, in the 89th year of her age. Pastors - Rev. William B. McIlvaine, Rev. John Gillespie.&quot; Notable occasions on which the bell was rung include the Centennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the passing of the funeral train of Resident McKinley, and during the World War as a call to prayer.

====Exterior lighting====
As part of the church&#x27;s 200th anniversary celebration, new exterior lighting was installed to highlight Ralph Adams Cram&#x27;s architectural masterpiece. The final phase of this project was to illuminate the tower. The new tower lighting was debuted on May 4, 2019.

===Trinity Chapel===
Following the deaths of Richard Beatty and Jennie King Mellon in 1942, the Church Session voted to construct to them a memorial which became Trinity Chapel. The entrance to the chapel is half-way down the east aisle and marked, above the doorway, with a carved shield of the Trinity. The doors are Siamese teak. The interior carvings are inspired by Peter Paul Rubens and the windows by Wilbur H. Burnham. The chapel, designed as well by Cram, was erected at a cost of $120,000 and dedicated January 15, 1944.

===Wayfarers&#x27; Chapel===
Desiring to be conscious of those suffering the economic repercussions of the 1929 Great Depression, the congregation intended to use the Wayfarers&#x27; Chapel (located at the corner of Baum and Whitfield) for a ministry of social service. However, by the time the church was completed in 1935, the worst of the Great Depression was over, and the Wayfarers&#x27; Chapel did not fulfill its intended use until many years later. Three windows in the chapel&#x27;s interior are designed by Howard G. Wilbert and depict the Great Seal of the United States of America, The Crucifixion, and an angel holding the Gospel.

===The Garth===
The term &quot;garth&quot; comes from the Old English word &quot;heard,&quot; or &quot;yard.&quot; In the chapel side wall of the garth can be seen the cornerstones of the congregation&#x27;s previous three church buildings from 1848, 1864, and 1887. The four sandstone columns, set in the northeast corner, are from the 1887 church. As a reminder that the land of the Garth was once used as graveyard, the tombstone of John Spahr is erected. The Garth includes a pulpit and is used frequently by the church for services and other events.

<text>Iguanodon ( ; meaning &#x27;iguana-tooth&#x27;), named in 1825, is a genus of iguanodontian dinosaur. While many species found worldwide have been classified in the genus &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, dating from the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, taxonomic revision in the early 21st century has defined &quot;Iguanodon&quot; to be based on one well-substantiated species: &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;, which lived during the Barremian to early Aptian ages of the Early Cretaceous in Belgium, Germany, England, and Spain, between about 126 and 122 million years ago. &quot;Iguanodon&quot; was a large, bulky herbivore, measuring up to in length and in body mass. Distinctive features include large thumb spikes, which were possibly used for defense against predators, combined with long prehensile fifth fingers able to forage for food.

The genus was named in 1825 by English geologist Gideon Mantell, based on fossil specimens found in England and was given the species name &quot;I. anglicus.&quot; &quot;Iguanodon&quot; was the second type of dinosaur formally named based on fossil specimens, after &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. Together with &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot;, it was one of the three genera originally used to define Dinosauria. The genus &quot;Iguanodon&quot; belongs to the larger group Iguanodontia, along with the duck-billed hadrosaurs. The taxonomy of this genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long-standing ones reassigned to other genera. 

In 1878 new, far more complete remains of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; were discovered in Belgium and studied by Louis Dollo. These were given the new species &quot;I. bernissartensis.&quot; In the early 21st century it became understood that the remains referred to as &quot;Iguanodon&quot; in England belonged to four different species (including &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;) that were not closely related to each other, which were subsequently split off into &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot;, &quot;Barilium&quot; and &quot;Hypselospinus.&quot; It was also found that the originally described type species of &quot;Iguanodon, I. anglicus&quot; is now a &quot;nomen dubium,&quot; and not valid. Thus the name &quot;Iguanodon&quot; became fixed around the well known species based primarily on the Belgian specimens. In 2015, a second valid species, &quot;I. galvensis&quot;, was named, based on fossils found in the Iberian Peninsula.

Scientific understanding of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; has evolved over time as new information has been obtained from fossils. The numerous specimens of this genus, including nearly complete skeletons from two well-known bone beds, have allowed researchers to make informed hypotheses regarding many aspects of the living animal, including feeding, movement, and social behaviour. As one of the first scientifically well-known dinosaurs, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; has occupied a small but notable place in the public&#x27;s perception of dinosaurs, its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains.

==Discovery and history==

===Gideon Mantell, Sir Richard Owen, and the discovery of dinosaurs===
The discovery of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; has long been accompanied by a popular legend. The story goes that Gideon Mantell&#x27;s wife, Mary Ann, discovered the first teeth of an &quot;Iguanodon&quot; in the strata of Tilgate Forest in Whitemans Green, Cuckfield, Sussex, England, in 1822 while her husband was visiting a patient. However, there is no evidence that Mantell took his wife with him while seeing patients. Furthermore, he admitted in 1851 that he himself had found the teeth, although he had previously stated in 1827 and 1833 that Mrs. Mantell had indeed found the first of the teeth later named &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. Other later authors agree that the story is not certainly false. It is known from his notebooks that Mantell first acquired large fossil bones from the quarry at Whitemans Green in 1820. Because also theropod teeth were found, thus belonging to carnivores, he at first interpreted these bones, which he tried to combine into a partial skeleton, as those of a giant crocodile. In 1821 Mantell mentioned the find of herbivorous teeth and began to consider the possibility that a large herbivorous reptile was present in the strata. However, in his 1822 publication &quot;Fossils of the South Downs&quot; he as yet did not dare to suggest a connection between the teeth and his very incomplete skeleton, presuming that his finds presented two large forms, one carnivorous (&quot;an animal of the Lizard Tribe of enormous magnitude&quot;), the other herbivorous.

In May 1822 he first presented the herbivorous teeth to the Royal Society of London but the members, among them William Buckland, dismissed them as fish teeth or the incisors of a rhinoceros from a Tertiary stratum. On 23 June 1823 Charles Lyell showed some to Georges Cuvier, during a soiree in Paris, but the famous French naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros. Though the very next day Cuvier retracted, Lyell reported only the dismissal to Mantell, who became rather diffident about the issue. In 1824 Buckland described &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and was on that occasion invited to visit Mantell&#x27;s collection. Seeing the bones on 6 March he agreed that these were of some giant saurian—though still denying it was a herbivore. Emboldened nevertheless, Mantell again sent some teeth to Cuvier, who answered on 22 June 1824 that he had determined that they were reptilian and quite possibly belonged to a giant herbivore. In a new edition that year of his &quot;Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles&quot; Cuvier admitted his earlier mistake, leading to an immediate acceptance of Mantell, and his new saurian, in scientific circles. Mantell tried to corroborate his theory further by finding a modern-day parallel among extant reptiles. In September 1824 he visited the Royal College of Surgeons but at first failed to find comparable teeth. However, assistant-curator Samuel Stutchbury recognised that they resembled those of an iguana he had recently prepared, albeit twenty times longer.

In recognition of the resemblance of the teeth to those of the iguana, Mantell decided to name his new animal &quot;Iguanodon&quot; or &#x27;iguana-tooth&#x27;, from &quot;iguana&quot; and the Greek word ὀδών (&quot;odon&quot;, &quot;odontos&quot; or &#x27;tooth&#x27;). Based on isometric scaling, he estimated that the creature might have been up to long, more than the length of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. His initial idea for a name was &quot;Iguana-saurus&quot; (&#x27;Iguana lizard&#x27;), but his friend William Daniel Conybeare suggested that that name was more applicable to the iguana itself, so a better name would be &quot;Iguanoides&quot; (&#x27;Iguana-like&#x27;) or &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. He neglected to add a specific name to form a proper binomial, but one was supplied in 1829 by Friedrich Holl: &quot;I. anglicum&quot;, which was later emended to &quot;I. anglicus&quot;.

Mantell sent a letter detailing his discovery to the local Portsmouth Philosophical Society in December 1824, several weeks after settling on a name for the fossil creature. The letter was read to members of the Society at a meeting on 17 December, and a report was published in the &quot;Hampshire Telegraph&quot; the following Monday, 20 December, which announced the name, misspelled as &quot;Iguanadon&quot;. Mantell formally published his findings on 10 February 1825, when he presented a paper on the remains to the Royal Society of London.

A more complete specimen of a similar animal was discovered in a quarry in Maidstone, Kent, in 1834 (lower Lower Greensand Formation), which Mantell soon acquired. He was led to identify it as an &quot;Iguanodon&quot; based on its distinctive teeth. The Maidstone slab (NHMUK PV OR 3791) was used in the first skeletal reconstructions and artistic renderings of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, but due to its incompleteness, Mantell made some mistakes, the most famous of which was the placement of what he thought was a horn on the nose. The discovery of much better specimens in later years revealed that the horn was actually a modified thumb. Still encased in rock, the Maidstone skeleton is currently displayed at the Natural History Museum in London. The borough of Maidstone commemorated this find by adding an &quot;Iguanodon&quot; as a supporter to their coat of arms in 1949. This specimen has become linked with the name &quot;I. mantelli&quot;, a species named in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in place of &quot;I. anglicus&quot;, but it actually comes from a different formation than the original &quot;I. mantelli&quot;/&quot;I. anglicus&quot; material. The Maidstone specimen, also known as Gideon Mantell&#x27;s &quot;Mantel-piece&quot;, and formally labelled NHMUK 3741 was subsequently excluded from &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. It is classified as &quot;cf.&quot; &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot; by McDonald (2012); as cf. &quot;Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis&quot; by Norman (2012); and made the holotype of a separate species &quot;Mantellodon carpenteri&quot; by Paul (2012), but this is considered dubious and it is generally considered a specimen of &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot;
At the same time, tension began to build between Mantell and Richard Owen, an ambitious scientist with much better funding and society connections in the turbulent worlds of Reform Act-era British politics and science. Owen, a firm creationist, opposed the early versions of evolutionary science (&quot;transmutationism&quot;) then being debated and used what he would soon coin as dinosaurs as a weapon in this conflict. With the paper describing Dinosauria, he scaled down dinosaurs from lengths of over , determined that they were not simply giant lizards, and put forward that they were advanced and mammal-like, characteristics given to them by God; according to the understanding of the time, they could not have been &quot;transmuted&quot; from reptiles to mammal-like creatures.

In 1849, a few years before his death in 1852, Mantell realised that iguanodonts were not heavy, pachyderm-like animals, as Owen was putting forward, but had slender forelimbs. However, since his passing left him unable to participate in the creation of the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, Owen&#x27;s vision of the dinosaurs became that seen by the public for decades. With Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, he had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two iguanodonts (based on the Maidstone specimen), one standing and one resting on its belly, were included. Before the sculpture of the standing iguanodont was completed, he held a banquet for twenty inside it.

===Bernissart mine discoveries and Dollo&#x27;s new reconstruction===

The largest find of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; remains to that date occurred on 28 February 1878 in a coal mine at Bernissart in Belgium, at a depth of , when two mineworkers, Jules Créteur and Alphonse Blanchard, accidentally hit on a skeleton that they initially took for petrified wood. With the encouragement of Alphonse Briart, supervisor of mines at nearby Morlanwelz, Louis de Pauw on 15 May 1878 started to excavate the skeletons and in 1882 Louis Dollo reconstructed them. At least 38 &quot;Iguanodon&quot; individuals were uncovered, most of which were adults. In 1882, the holotype specimen of &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; became one of the first ever dinosaur skeletons mounted for display. It was put together in a chapel at the Palace of Charles of Lorraine using a series of adjustable ropes attached to scaffolding so that a lifelike pose could be achieved during the mounting process. This specimen, along with several others, first opened for public viewing in an inner courtyard of the palace in July 1883. In 1891 they were moved to the Royal Museum of Natural History, where they are still on display; nine are displayed as standing mounts, and nineteen more are still in the Museum&#x27;s basement. The exhibit makes an impressive display in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, in Brussels. A replica of one of these is on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge. Most of the remains were referred to a new species, &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;, a larger and much more robust animal than the English remains had yet revealed. One specimen, IRSNB 1551, was at first referred to the nebulous, gracile &quot;I. mantelli&quot;, but is currently referred to &quot;Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis&quot;. The skeletons were some of the first complete dinosaur skeletons known. Found with the dinosaur skeletons were the remains of plants, fish, and other reptiles, including the crocodyliform &quot;Bernissartia&quot;.

The science of conserving fossil remains was in its infancy, and new techniques had to be improvised to deal with what soon became known as &quot;pyrite disease&quot;. Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue, finishing with a final layer of tin foil. Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethylene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.

Dollo&#x27;s specimens allowed him to show that Owen&#x27;s prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike that had been on the nose firmly on the thumb. His reconstruction would prevail for a long period of time, but would later be discounted.

Excavations at the quarry were stopped in 1881, although it was not exhausted of fossils, as recent drilling operations have shown. During World War I, when the town was occupied by German forces, preparations were made to reopen the mine for palaeontology, and Otto Jaekel was sent from Berlin to supervise. Just as the first fossiliferous layer was about to be uncovered, however, the German army surrendered and had to withdraw. Further attempts to reopen the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded.

===Turn of the century and the Dinosaur Renaissance===

Research on &quot;Iguanodon&quot; decreased during the early part of the 20th century as World Wars and the Great Depression enveloped Europe. A new species that would become the subject of much study and taxonomic controversy, &quot;I. atherfieldensis&quot;, was named in 1925 by R. W. Hooley, for a specimen collected at Atherfield Point on the Isle of Wight.

&quot;Iguanodon&quot; was not part of the initial work of the dinosaur renaissance that began with the description of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; in 1969, but it was not neglected for long. David B. Weishampel&#x27;s work on ornithopod feeding mechanisms provided a better understanding of how it fed, and David B. Norman&#x27;s work on numerous aspects of the genus has made it one of the best-known dinosaurs. In addition, a further find of numerous disarticulated &quot;Iguanodon&quot; bones in Nehden, Nordrhein-Westphalen, Germany, has provided evidence for gregariousness in this genus, as the animals in this areally restricted find appear to have been killed by flash floods. At least 15 individuals, from long, have been found here, most of the individuals belong to the related &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot; (described as &quot;I. atherfieldensis&quot;, at that time believed to be another species of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;). but some are of &quot;I. bernissartensis.&quot;

One major revision to &quot;Iguanodon&quot; brought by the Renaissance would be another re-thinking of how to reconstruct the animal. A major flaw with Dollo&#x27;s reconstruction was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.

===21st century research and the splitting of the genus===
In the 21st century, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; material has been used in the search for dinosaur biomolecules. In research by Graham Embery &quot;et al.,&quot; &quot;Iguanodon&quot; bones were processed to look for remnant proteins. In this research, identifiable remains of typical bone proteins, such as phosphoproteins and proteoglycans, were found in a rib. In 2007, Gregory S. Paul split &quot;I. atherfieldensis&quot; into a new, separate genus, &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot; which has been generally accepted. In 2009 fragmentary iguanodontid material was described from upper Barremian Paris Basin deposits in Auxerre, Burgundy. While not definitively diagnosable to the genus/species level, the specimen shares &quot;obvious morphological and dimensional affinities&quot; with &quot;I. bernissartensis.&quot;

In 2010, David Norman split the Valanginian species &quot;I. dawsoni&quot; and &quot;I. fittoni&quot; into &quot;Barilium&quot; and &quot;Hypselospinus&quot; respectively. After Norman 2010, over half a dozen new genera were named off English &quot;Iguanodon&quot; material. Carpenter and Ishida in 2010 named &quot;Proplanicoxa, Torilion&quot; and &quot;Sellacoxa&quot; while Gregory S. Paul in 2012 named &quot;Darwinsaurus&quot;, &quot;Huxleysaurus&quot; and &quot;Mantellodon&quot; and Macdonald et al. in 2012 named &quot;Kukufeldia&quot;. These species named after Norman 2010 are not considered valid and are considered various junior synonyms of &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot;, &quot;Barilium&quot; and &quot;Hypselospinus.&quot;

In 2011, a new genus &quot;Delapparentia&quot; was named for a specimen in Spain that was originally thought to belong to &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;. The previous identification was subsequently reaffirmed in a new analysis of individual variation in the Belgian specimens, finding that the &quot;Delapparentia&quot; specimen was within the range of &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;. In 2015 a new species of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;I. galvensis&quot;, was named based on material including 13 juvenile (perinate) individuals found in the Camarillas Formation near Galve, Spain. In 2017 a new study was done of &quot;I. galvensis,&quot; with further evidence of distinctiveness from &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; including several new autapomorphies. It was also found that the &quot;Delapparentia&quot; holotype (which is also from the Camarillas Formation) was not distinguishable from either &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; or &quot;I. galvensis&quot;.
==Description==

&quot;Iguanodon&quot; were bulky herbivores that could shift from bipedality to quadrupedality. The only well-supported species, &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;, is estimated to have measured about long as an adult, with some specimens possibly as long as , although this is likely an overestimate, given that the maximum body length of &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; is reported to be . Although Gregory S. Paul suggested a body mass of on average, constructing a 3D mathematical model and employing allometry-based estimate suggests an &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; close to long (smaller than average) weighs close to in body mass. Specimens of relatively large individuals have been reported in the 2020s: a specimen referred to as &quot;I.&quot; cf. &quot;galvensis&quot; was measured up to in length, while a new specimen of &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; from the upper Barremian of the Iberian Peninsula was measured up to in length. Such large individuals would have weighed approximately .The arms of &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; were long (up to 75% the length of the legs) and robust, with rather inflexible hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal&#x27;s nose. Later fossils revealed the true nature of the thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).

These animals had large, tall but narrow skulls, with toothless beaks probably covered with keratin, and teeth like those of iguanas, as the name suggests, but much larger and more closely packed. Unlike hadrosaurids, which had columns of replacement teeth, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position. The upper jaw held up to 29 teeth per side, with none at the front of the jaw, and the lower jaw 25; the numbers differ because teeth in the lower jaw are broader than those in the upper. Because the tooth rows are deeply inset from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is believed that, as with most other ornithischians, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; had some sort of cheek-like structure, muscular or non-muscular, to retain food in the mouth.

==Classification and evolution==
&quot;Iguanodon&quot; gives its name to the unranked clade Iguanodontia, a very populous group of ornithopods with many species known from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Aside from &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, the best-known members of the clade include &quot;Dryosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ouranosaurus&quot;, and the duck-bills, or hadrosaurs. In older sources, Iguanodontidae was shown as a distinct family. This family traditionally has been something of a wastebasket taxon, including ornithopods that were neither hypsilophodontids or hadrosaurids. In practice, animals like &quot;Callovosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;, &quot;Craspedodon&quot;, &quot;Kangnasaurus&quot;, &quot;Mochlodon&quot;, &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot;, &quot;Ouranosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Probactrosaurus&quot; were usually assigned to this family.

With the advent of cladistic analyses, Iguanodontidae as traditionally construed was shown to be paraphyletic, and these animals are recognised to fall at different points in relation to hadrosaurs on a cladogram, instead of in a single distinct clade. Essentially, the modern concept of Iguanodontidae currently includes only &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. Groups like Iguanodontoidea are still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional iguanodontids are now included in the superfamily Hadrosauroidea. &quot;Iguanodon&quot; lies between &quot;Camptosaurus&quot; and &quot;Ouranosaurus&quot; in cladograms, and is probably descended from a camptosaur-like animal. At one point, Jack Horner suggested, based mostly on skull features, that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups, with &quot;Iguanodon&quot; on the line to the flat-headed hadrosaurines, and &quot;Ouranosaurus&quot; on the line to the crested lambeosaurines, but his proposal has been rejected.

The cladogram below follows an analysis by Andrew McDonald, 2012.

==Species==
Because &quot;Iguanodon&quot; is one of the first dinosaur genera to have been named, numerous species have been assigned to it. While never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early genera of dinosaurs (such as &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;) became, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; has had a complicated history, and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions. Although Gregory Paul recommended restricting &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; to the famous sample from Bernissart, ornithopod workers like Norman and McDonald have disagreed with Paul&#x27;s recommendations, except exercising caution when accepting records of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; from France and Spain as valid.

&quot;I. anglicus&quot; was the original type species, but the lectotype was based on a single tooth and only partial remains of the species have been recovered since. In March 2000, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature changed the type species to the much better known &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;, with the new holotype being IRSNB 1534. The original &quot;Iguanodon&quot; tooth is held at Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand in Wellington, although it is not on display. The fossil arrived in New Zealand following the move of Gideon Mantell&#x27;s son Walter there; after the elder Mantell&#x27;s death, his fossils went to Walter.

===Species currently accepted as valid===
Only two species assigned to &quot;Iguanodon&quot; are still considered to be valid.
*&quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;, described by George Albert Boulenger in 1881, is the type species for the genus. This species is best known for the many skeletons discovered in the Sainte-Barbe Clays Formation at Bernissart, but is also known from remains across Europe. 
**&quot;Delapparentia turolensis&quot;, named in 2011 based on a specimen previously assigned to &quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot;, was argued to be distinct from the latter based on the relative height of its neural spines. However, a 2017 study noted that this is easily within the range of individual variation, and that the difference may also arise from &quot;D. turolensis&quot; being an adult older than other specimens of &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;.
**&quot;I. seelyi&quot; (also incorrectly spelled &quot;I. seeleyi&quot;), described by John Hulke in 1882, has also been synonymised with &quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot;, though this is not universally accepted. It was discovered in Brook, on the Isle of Wight, and named after Charles Seely MP, Liberal politician and philanthropist, on whose estate it was found. 
**David Norman has suggested that &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; includes the dubious Mongolian &quot;I. orientalis&quot; (see also below), but this has not been followed by other researchers.
*&quot;I. galvensis&quot;, described in 2015, is based on adult and juvenile remains found in Barremian-age deposits in Teruel, Spain.

===Reassigned species of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;===
* &quot;I. albinus&quot; (or &quot;Albisaurus scutifer&quot;), described by Czech palaeontologist Antonin Fritsch in 1893, is a dubious nondinosaurian reptile now known as &quot;Albisaurus albinus&quot;.
* &quot;I. atherfieldensis&quot;, described by R.W. Hooley in 1925, was smaller and less robust than &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;, with longer neural spines. It was renamed &quot;Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis&quot; in 2007. The Bernissart specimen RBINS 1551 was described as &quot;Dollodon bampingi&quot; in 2008, but McDonald and Norman returned &quot;Dollodon&quot; to synonymy with &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot;.
* &quot;I. dawsoni&quot;, described by Lydekker in 1888, is known from two partial skeletons found in East Sussex, England, from the middle Valanginian-age Lower Cretaceous Wadhurst Clay. It is now the type species of &quot;Barilium&quot;.
* &quot;I. exogyrarum&quot; was described by Fritsch in 1878. It is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; based on very poor material and was renamed &quot;Ponerosteus&quot; in 2000.
* &quot;I. fittoni&quot; was described by Lydekker in 1889. Like &quot;I. dawsoni&quot;, this species was described from the Wadhurst Clay of East Sussex. It is now the type species of &quot;Hypselospinus&quot;.
* &quot;I. hilli&quot;, coined by Edwin Tully Newton in 1892 for a tooth from the early Cenomanian Upper Cretaceous Lower Chalk of Hertfordshire, has been considered an early hadrosaurid of some sort. However, recent work places it as indeterminate beyond Hadrosauroidea outside Hadrosauridae.
* &quot;I. hoggi&quot; (also spelled &quot;I. boggii&quot; or &quot;hoggii&quot;), named by Owen for a lower jaw from the Tithonian–Berriasian-age Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous Purbeck Beds of Dorset in 1874, has been reassigned to its own genus, &quot;Owenodon&quot;.
* &quot;I. hollingtoniensis&quot; (also spelled &quot;I. hollingtonensis&quot;), described by Lydekker in 1889, has variously been considered a synonym of &quot;Hypselospinus fittoni&quot; or a distinct species assigned to the genus &quot;Huxleysaurus&quot;. A specimen from the Valanginian Wadhurst Clay Formation, variously assigned to &quot;I. hollingtoniensis&quot; and &quot;I. mantelli&quot; over the years, has an unusual combination of hadrosaurid-like lower jaw and very robust forelimb; Norman (2010) assigned this specimen to the species &quot;Hypselospinus fittoni&quot;, while Paul (2012) made it the holotype of a separate species &quot;Darwinsaurus evolutionis&quot;.
* &quot;I. lakotaensis&quot; was described by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork in 1989. The only well-accepted North American species of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;I. lakotaensis&quot; was described from a partial skull from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota. Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers suggest that it was more basal than &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;, and related to &quot;Theiophytalia&quot;, but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;. Gregory S. Paul has since given the species its own genus, &quot;Dakotadon&quot;.
* &quot;I. mantelli&quot; described by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1832, was based on the same material as &quot;I. anglicus&quot; and is an objective junior synonym of the latter. Several taxa, including the holotype of &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot; and &quot;Mantellodon&quot;, but also the dubious hadrosauroid &quot;Trachodon cantabrigiensis&quot; the hypsilophodont &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, and &quot;Valdosaurus&quot;, were previously mis-assigned to &quot;I. mantelli&quot;.
* &quot;I. mongolensis&quot; is a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; from a photo caption in a book by Whitfield in 1992 of remains that would later be named &quot;Altirhinus&quot;.
* &quot;I. orientalis&quot;, described by A. K. Rozhdestvensky in 1952, was based on poor material, but a skull with a distinctive arched snout that had been assigned to it was renamed &quot;Altirhinus kurzanovi&quot; in 1998. At the same time, &quot;I. orientalis&quot; was considered to be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; because it cannot be compared to &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;.
* &quot;I. phillipsi&quot; was described by Harry Seeley in 1869, but he later reassigned it to &quot;Priodontognathus&quot;.
* &quot;I. praecursor&quot; (also spelled &quot;I. precursor&quot;), described by E. Sauvage in 1876 from teeth from an unnamed Kimmeridgian (Late Jurassic) formation in Pas-de-Calais, France, is actually a sauropod, sometimes assigned to &quot;Neosodon&quot;, although the two come from different formations.
* &quot;I. prestwichii&quot; (also spelled &quot;I. prestwichi&quot;), described by John Hulke in 1880, has been reassigned to &quot;Camptosaurus prestwichii&quot; or to its own genus &quot;Cumnoria&quot;.
* &quot;I. suessii&quot;, described by Emanuel Bunzel in 1871, has been reassigned to &quot;Mochlodon suessi&quot;.

===Species reassigned to &quot;Iguanodon&quot;===
* &quot;I. foxii&quot; (also spelled &quot;I. foxi&quot;) was originally described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 as the type species of &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;; Owen (1873 or 1874) reassigned it to &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, but his assignment was soon overturned.
* &quot;I. gracilis&quot;, named by Lydekker in 1888 as the type species of &quot;Sphenospondylus&quot; and assigned to &quot;Iguanodon&quot; in 1969 by Rodney Steel, has been suggested to be a synonym of &quot;Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis&quot;, but is considered dubious nowadays.
* &quot;I. major&quot;, a species named by Justin Delair in 1966, based on vertebrae from the Isle of Wight and Sussex originally described by Owen in 1842 as a species of &quot;Streptospondylus&quot;, &quot;S. major&quot;, is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.
* &quot;I. valdensis&quot;, a renaming of &quot;Vectisaurus valdensis&quot; by Ernst van den Broeck in 1900. Originally named by Hulke as a distinct genus in 1879 based on vertebral and pelvic remains, it was from the Barremian stage of the Isle of Wight. It was considered a juvenile specimen of &quot;Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis&quot;, or an undetermined species of &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot;, but is indeterminate beyond Iguanodontia.
* The &quot;nomen nudum&quot; &quot;Proiguanodon&quot; (van den Broeck, 1900) also belongs here.

===Dubious species===
* &quot;I. anglicus&quot;, described by Friedrich Holl in 1829, is the original type species of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, but, as discussed above, was replaced by &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;. In the past, it has been spelled as &quot;I. angelicus&quot; (Lessem and Glut, 1993) and &quot;I. anglicum&quot; (Holl, 1829 emend. Bronn, 1850). It is possible teeth ascribed to this species belong to the genus now called &quot;Barilium&quot;. The name &quot;Therosaurus&quot; (Fitzinger, 1840), is a junior objective synonym, a later name for the material of &quot;I. anglicus&quot;.
* &quot;I. ottingeri&quot;, described by Peter Galton and James A. Jensen in 1979, is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; based on teeth from the possibly Aptian-age lower Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah.

==Palaeobiology==
===Feeding===

One of the first details noted about &quot;Iguanodon&quot; was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, although there has not always been consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw symphysis, which he found best compared to that of the two-toed sloth and the extinct ground sloth &quot;Mylodon&quot;. He also suggested that &quot;Iguanodon&quot; had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the hyoid bones that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.

The skull was structured in such a way that as it closed, the bones holding the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out. This would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth to rub against the upper surface of the lower jaw&#x27;s teeth, grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian chewing. Because the teeth were always replaced, the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life, and could eat tough plant material. Additionally, the front ends of the animal&#x27;s jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes, both upper and lower, providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off twigs and shoots. Its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger, which could have been used to manipulate objects, unlike the other fingers.

Exactly what &quot;Iguanodon&quot; ate with its well-developed jaws is not known. The size of the larger species, such as &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;, would have allowed them access to food from ground level to tree foliage at high. A diet of horsetails, cycads, and conifers was suggested by David Norman, although iguanodonts in general have been tied to the advance of angiosperm plants in the Cretaceous due to the dinosaurs&#x27; inferred low-browsing habits. Angiosperm growth, according to this hypothesis, would have been encouraged by iguanodont feeding because gymnosperms would be removed, allowing more space for the weed-like early angiosperms to grow. The evidence is not conclusive, though. Whatever its exact diet, due to its size and abundance, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; is regarded as a dominant medium to large herbivore for its ecological communities. In England, this included the small predator &quot;Aristosuchus&quot;, larger predators &quot;Eotyrannus&quot;, &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, and &quot;Neovenator&quot;, low-feeding herbivores &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; and &quot;Valdosaurus&quot;, fellow &quot;iguanodontid&quot; &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot;, the armoured herbivore &quot;Polacanthus&quot;, and sauropods like &quot;Pelorosaurus&quot;.

===Posture and movement===

Early fossil remains were fragmentary, which led to much speculation on the posture and nature of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. &quot;Iguanodon&quot; was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were much smaller than the hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen&#x27;s vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.

During his re-examination of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, David Norman was able to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.

Furthermore, it appears that &quot;Iguanodon&quot; became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; juvenile &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal&#x27;s hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus&#x27;s arms and hands. The three-toed pes (&quot;foot&quot;) of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would have been used in a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; it would not have been able to gallop as a quadruped.

Large three-toed footprints are known in Early Cretaceous rocks of England, particularly Wealden beds on the Isle of Wight, and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret. Some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on. In 1846, E. Tagert went so far as to assign them to an ichnogenus he named &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, and Samuel Beckles noted in 1854 that they looked like bird tracks, but might have come from dinosaurs. The identity of the trackmakers was greatly clarified upon the discovery in 1857 of the hind leg of a young &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, with distinctly three-toed feet, showing that such dinosaurs could have made the tracks. Despite the lack of direct evidence, these tracks are often attributed to &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. A trackway in England shows what may be an &quot;Iguanodon&quot; moving on all fours, but the foot prints are poor, making a direct connection difficult. Tracks assigned to the ichnogenus &quot;Iguanodon&quot; are known from locations including places in Europe where the body fossil &quot;Iguanodon&quot; is known, to Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway.

===Thumb spike===
The thumb spike is one of the best-known features of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. Although it was originally placed on the animal&#x27;s nose by Mantell, the complete Bernissart specimens allowed Dollo to place it correctly on the hand, as a modified thumb. (This would not be the last time a dinosaur&#x27;s modified thumb claw would be misinterpreted; &quot;Noasaurus&quot;, &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, and &quot;Megaraptor&quot; are examples since the 1980s where an enlarged thumb claw was first put on the foot, as in dromaeosaurids.)

This thumb is typically interpreted as a close-quarter stiletto-like weapon against predators, although it could also have been used to break into seeds and fruits, or against other &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. One author has suggested that the spike was attached to a venom gland, but this has not been accepted, as the spike was not hollow, nor were there any grooves on the spike for conducting venom.

===Possible social behaviour===
Although sometimes interpreted as the result of a single catastrophe, the Bernissart finds instead are now interpreted as recording multiple events. According to this interpretation, at least three occasions of mortality are recorded, and though numerous individuals would have died in a geologically short time span (?10–100 years), this does not necessarily mean these &quot;Iguanodon&quot; were herding animals.

An argument against herding is that juvenile remains are very uncommon at this site, unlike modern cases with herd mortality. They more likely were the periodic victims of flash floods whose carcasses accumulated in a lake or marshy setting. The Nehden find, however, with its greater span of individual ages, more even mix of &quot;Dollodon&quot; or &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot; to &quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot;, and confined geographic nature, may record mortality of herding animals migrating through rivers.

There is no evidence that &quot;Iguanodon&quot; was sexually dimorphic (with one sex appreciably different from the other). At one time, it was suggested that the Bernissart &quot;I.&quot; &quot;mantelli&quot;, or &quot;I. atherfieldensis&quot; (&quot;Dollodon&quot; and &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot;, respectively) represented a sex, possibly female, of the larger and more robust, possibly male, &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot;. However, this is not supported today. A 2017 analysis showed that &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; does exhibit a large level of individual variation in both its limbs (scapula, humerus, thumb claw, ilium, ischium, femur, tibia) and spinal column (axis, sacrum, tail vertebrae). Additionally, this analysis found that individuals of &quot;I. bernissartensis&quot; generally seemed to fall into two categories based on whether their tail vertebrae bore a furrow on the bottom, and whether their thumb claws were large or small.

===Paleopathology===
Evidence of a fractured hip bone was found in a specimen of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, which had an injury to its ischium. Two other individuals were observed with signs of osteoarthritis as evidenced by bone overgrowths in their anklebones which are called osteophytes.

==In popular culture==

Since its description in 1825, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; has been a feature of worldwide popular culture. Two lifesize reconstructions of &quot;Mantellodon&quot; (considered &quot;Iguanodon&quot; at the time) built at the Crystal Palace in London in 1852 greatly contributed to the popularity of the genus. Their thumb spikes were mistaken for horns, and they were depicted as elephant-like quadrupeds, yet this was the first time an attempt was made at constructing full-size dinosaur models. In 1910 Heinrich Harder portrayed a group of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; in &quot;Tiere der Urwelt&quot;, a classic German collecting card game about extinct and prehistoric animals.

Several motion pictures have featured &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. In the 2000 Disney animated film &quot;Dinosaur&quot;, an &quot;Iguanodon&quot; named Aladar served as the protagonist with three other iguanodonts as other main and minor characters are Neera, Kron and Bruton. A loosely related ride of the same name at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom is based around bringing an &quot;Iguanodon&quot; back to the present. &quot;Iguanodon&quot; is one of the three dinosaur genera that inspired Godzilla; the other two were &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. &quot;Iguanodon&quot; has also made appearances in some of the many &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; films, as well as episodes of the television series.

Aside from appearances in movies, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; has also been featured on the television documentary miniseries &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; (1999) produced by the BBC (along with then-undescribed &quot;Dakotadon lakotaensis&quot;) and played a starring role in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s book &quot;The Lost World&quot; as well as featuring in the 2015 documentary &quot;Dinosaur Britain&quot;. It also was present in Bob Bakker&#x27;s &quot;Raptor Red&quot; (1995), as a &quot;Utahraptor&quot; prey item. A main belt asteroid, , has been named 9941 Iguanodon in honour of the genus.

Because it is both one of the first dinosaurs described and one of the best-known dinosaurs, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; has been well-placed as a barometer of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs. Its reconstructions have gone through three stages: the elephantine quadrupedal horn-snouted reptile satisfied the Victorians, then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated the early 20th century, but was slowly overturned during the 1960s by its current, more agile and dynamic representation, able to shift from two legs to all fours.

<text>Tikhon of Zadonsk (secular name Timofey Savelyevich Sokolov, ; 1724–1783) was an 18th-century Russian Orthodox bishop and spiritual writer whom the Eastern Orthodox Church glorified (canonized) as a saint in 1861.

St. Tikhon was born in Novgorod, Russia, and grew up in extreme poverty. After spending much of his childhood working at peasant labour, he entered the Novgorod Seminary on a grant and was a brilliant student: he went on to teach Greek, Rhetoric and Philosophy at the seminary. He became a monk in 1758, and in 1763 was appointed Bishop of Voronezh, where he became revered for his energetic commitment to the spiritual education and wellbeing of both the laity and the clergy of his diocese. Due to ill health, he retired to the monastery at Zadonsk in 1769, where he lived until his death in 1783. At Zadonsk he wrote a number of luminous books and treatises, and became a much-loved spiritual advisor and man of God. 

The life and works of Tikhon inspired Dostoevsky, who reflected them in the character of Bishop Tikhon in the novel &quot;Demons&quot; (1871–1872) and in the characters of Alyosha Karamazov and of the Elder Zosima in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1879–1880).

==Biography==
Tikhon was born Timofey Kirillov in 1724 in the village of Korotsko, in the Novgorod region of Russia. When still an infant, he was given a new family name, Sokolov, by the head of the Novgorod Theological Seminary. Tikhon lived with his mother in extreme poverty, and was required to do peasant labour for long hours as a child. At the age of thirteen he was sent to a clergy school, and paid his way by working with the vegetable gardeners. At sixteen, he entered Novgorod Seminary under a state grant and excelled at his studies. In 1754, he became a teacher at the seminary, first in Greek, and later in Rhetoric and Philosophy. He took monastic vows with the name Tikhon in 1758.

On 13 May 1761 he was ordained a bishop of Kexholm and Ladoga, vicar bishop of the Diocese of Novgorod. On 3 February 1863 he was transferred to the Diocese of Voronezh. As Bishop he sought to revitalise the spiritual life of the cathedral and the community. He encouraged and instructed the clergy in their spiritual duties, formed a Mission to restore sectarians to Orthodoxy, turned judicial administration towards correction rather than punishment, and defended subordinates from secular authorities. He promoted education among the people, and transformed the Slavic-Latin school into a seminary, for which he developed the curriculum and assembled a staff of experienced instructors. Above all he sought to restore faith and enthusiasm for the spiritual life to both the monasteries and the people, through both preaching and writing. He wrote a treatise &quot;On the Seven Holy Mysteries&quot; designed to give clergy an understanding of the sacraments they performed, and another &quot;On the Mystery of Holy Repentance&quot; in which he offers a guide to spiritual advisors on receiving confession. He wrote a long essay entitled &quot;Flesh and Spirit&quot;, fifteen articles of exhortation to the monks, and a number of special essays for the people sent to all the churches. Tikhon served as bishop for nearly five years, before requesting dismissal due to ill health. He at first settled at the Tolshevsky monastery near Voronezh before retiring to the monastery of Zadonsk in 1769, where he lived until his death in 1783.

At Zadonsk, Tikhon engaged in theological studies and writing, and adopted a strict ascetic life: despite his frail health he ate very little and often engaged in hard physical work. He was, however, indulgent to others&#x27; weaknesses, and was known for his deep humility and forgiveness, though he was himself naturally of a nervous and oversensitive temperament. Despite his erudition, he took lessons in spirituality from simple and illiterate monastic elders. In Zadonsk, Tikhon&#x27;s reputation for piety, humility, kindness and wisdom drew many people to the monastery in search of his blessing and advice. He was not averse to leaving the monastery and moving among the local people if a situation required it, and would occasionally travel to more distant destinations.

Tikhon&#x27;s two major literary works during his retirement were the books &quot;A Spiritual Treasury Gathered from the World&quot; (1770) and &quot;On True Christianity&quot; (1776). He also wrote shorter works especially for monks, such as &quot;Rules of Monastic Life&quot; and &quot;Instruction to those who turn from the vain world&quot;. His own life at the monastery was described in some detail by two of his cell attendants.

On May 14, 1846, during the construction of the new cathedral at Zadonsk, Tikhon&#x27;s relics were uncovered. His relics were rumoured to be incorrupt, and there were numerous reports of miracles occurring near them. The Russian Orthodox Church made Tikhon a saint in 1861. His feast day is celebrated on August 13, Julian calendar (August 26, Gregorian Calendar). Another feast day, the Uncovering of the Relics of Saint Tikhon of Zadonsk, was instituted to be celebrated annually on May 14.

== Character ==

St. Tikhon studied and taught in the Latin schools at Novgorod and Tver. Though primarily influenced by the church fathers, he also appreciated some modern western theologians, particularly Johann Arndt. Tikhon&#x27;s chief work &quot;On True Christianity&quot; (Об истинном христианстве, &quot;Ob istinnom khristianstve&quot;) bore the same title as Arndt&#x27;s . Tikhon was exceptionally gifted with words and had a writing style that was artistic, simple, and &quot;surprisingly limpid&quot;. Theologian Georges Florovsky describes Tikhon thus:His grace and lucidity, his freedom—and not merely freedom from the world but also in the world—is the most striking quality in St. Tikhon&#x27;s personality. He has the easy grace of a pilgrim or traveler neither deflected nor restrained by this world. &quot;Every living being on earth is a wayfarer.&quot; However, this conquering grace was achieved through painful trial and ascetic effort. The dark waves of deep weariness and despair are quite clearly visible in Tikhon&#x27;s limpid spirit as they rush over him... His peculiar subjective despair, his special temptation to melancholy as a form of uncustomary disclosure of the soul, is wholly unique in Russian asceticism and more readily suggestive of the Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross. At times Tikhon would fall into a helpless torpor, confinement, and immobility, when everything around him was dark, empty, and unresponsive. Sometimes he could not compel himself to leave his cell; at other times he seemingly tried to escape physically from despair by moving about. Tikhon&#x27;s whole spirit had been overwhelmed in this ordeal, yet that trial left no traces or scars. The original luminosity of his soul was only purified in his personal progress.

Though Tikhon chose an ascetic life, he remained a pastor and a teacher, and did not refrain from actively involving himself in affairs of the world if his deep sensitivity to suffering was aroused. He was one of the first men of God to encounter the effects of the new Russian atheism, and this encounter is reflected in his writings and in anecdotes about him. He frequently intervened on behalf of mistreated peasants and sought to practice and promote Christian love in a time of darkness. On occasion he was physically attacked by landowners under the influence of the prevailing Voltairian antireligious ideas, but his strength and humility in these situations was said to be powerful enough to produce a change of heart in his assailant. He is reported by his monk-servant to have frequently engaged in ecstatic speech, but at other times to have become &quot;lost in thought&quot;, whereupon he would retreat into solitude and prayer.

According to Florovsky, St. Tikhon &quot;combined an intense concentration of the spirit with an exceptional capacity for tenderness and love.&quot; Florovsky describes Tikhon&#x27;s books, particularly &quot;On True Christianity&quot;, as graceful, poetic and free, &quot;less a dogmatic system than a book of mystical ethics&quot;, and the first attempt at a &quot;living theology&quot;, &quot;a theology based on experience, in contrast and as a counterweight to scholastic erudition, which lacks any such experience.&quot;

== Influence ==
Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky admired Tikhon, and was influenced by aspects of both his teaching and his character. A character called Tikhon plays a vital role in the controversial chapter &quot;Stavrogin&#x27;s Confession&quot; (or &quot;At Tikhon&#x27;s&quot;) in &quot;Demons&quot;. The character is a former bishop living at a monastery, who suffers from a number of physical and nervous ailments but nonetheless demonstrates a profoundly compassionate insight into the state of mind of his interlocutor, the deeply troubled Nikolay Stavrogin. The teachings of the Elder, Zosima, in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, are based on some of Tikhon&#x27;s teachings, and constitute Dostoevsky&#x27;s attempt to provide a truly Christian response to the materialistic, rationalistic, and nihilistic doctrines that were becoming increasingly dominant in Russian society at the time. Tikhon&#x27;s re-affirmation of the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, and his lament for the moral and spiritual decay following from its rejection, is echoed in the novel. Like Dostoevsky, Tikhon connected the Resurrection with the creation of Heavan on Earth through Love, and not with the ideas of retribution and punishment contained in The Last Judgment:How wonderful everything would be if everyone loved one another! Then there would be no robbery, no deceit, no murder... the jails would not be overflowing with prisoners, locked up for crimes, moneylending, failure to pay debts; there would finally be no poor or needy any longer, but all would be equal.&quot;

==Sayings==

&quot;Forgiveness is better than revenge.&quot;

&quot;Love is higher than fasting&quot;.

&quot;Try to know yourself, your own wickedness. Think on the greatness of God and your wretchedness. Meditate on the suffering of Christ, the magnitude of Whose love and suffering surpass our understanding. Ascribe the good that you do to God alone. Do not think about the sin of a brother but about what in him is better than in yourself ... Flee from glory, honors and praise, but if this is impossible, be sorry that such is your lot. Be benevolent to people of low origin. Be freely and willingly obedient not only to those above you but to those below ... The lowlier we are in spirit, the better we know ourselves, and without humility we cannot see God.&quot;

&quot;Just as the body has an ear, so also does the soul. Not everybody has an ear that is open, nor does every soul. God commands the soul: do not kill, do not steal, do not commit adultery, turn away from evil and do good, etc. The soul whose ears are open, hears and listens to God speaking and does what God commands. Truly, such a soul cannot but hear God and obey His commandments if it has its ears open. Men listen and carry out the commands of earthly kings and lesser authorities, and will not a soul listen to God speaking if it has its ears open? Of course! And with what fervor and delight will it not listen and say to Him: &quot;Ready is my heart, O God, ready is my heart&quot;&quot;. (Ps. 108, Septuagint)

&quot;For love does not seek its own, it labors, sweats, watches to build up the brother: nothing is inconvenient to love, and by the help of God it turns the impossible into the possible ... Love believes and hopes ... It is ashamed of nothing. Without it, what is the use of prayer? What use are hymns and singing? What is the use of building and adorning churches? What is mortification of the flesh if the neighbor is not loved? Indeed, all are of no consequence ... As an animal cannot exist without bodily warmth, So no good deed can be alive without true love; it is only the pretence of a good deed.&quot;

<text>The Berwyn range (Welsh: &quot;Y Berwyn&quot; or &quot;Mynydd y Berwyn&quot;) is an isolated and sparsely populated area of moorland in the northeast of Wales, roughly bounded by Llangollen in the northeast, Corwen in the northwest, Bala in the southwest, and Oswestry in the southeast.

==Description==
The area is wild and largely vegetated by heather about one metre thick, with some acidic grassland and bracken. It is not very popular for hill-walking or scrambling since the peaks are lower than those in nearby Snowdonia. However, the topmost peaks are rugged and have a distinctive character. Nearby towns include Llangollen and Corwen, which are popular tourist destinations.

The main summits are Cadair Berwyn at above sea level, Moel Sych at and Cadair Bronwen at above sea level.
The Berwyn range is crossed to the southwest by the B4391 Milltir Cerrig mountain pass at an elevation of .

Cadair Berwyn is the highest point in the Berwyn range, and the highest point in Wales outside the National Parks. Cadair Bronwen and Foel Cedig to the west are the two Marilyns that form the Berwyn range.

The mountain lies on main ridge of the Berwyn range which runs north–south. The eastern side of the ridge is characterised by steep drops and crags including Craig Berwyn north of the summit and Craig y Llyn to the south. Craig y Llyn forms the headwall of a cwm, and it is to this that the word cadair (chair in Welsh) presumably refers. Further north along the ridge is Cadair Bronwen, whilst to south the ridge continues to Moel Sych (Welsh pronunciation: [ˈmɔil ˈsɨːx], meaning &quot;dry hill&quot;).

It is often reported that Moel Sych, along the ridge, is of equal height, but Cadair Berwyn&#x27;s spot height on the Ordnance Survey maps, where the trig point stands, is not the true summit. Cadair Berwyn&#x27;s summit, south of the trig point, is three metres taller than Moel Sych. This summit is listed as Cadair Berwyn New Top on the Nuttall list.

Several other summits in the area are listed as Hewitts or Nuttalls, including Foel Wen ([ˈvɔil ˈwɛn], Welsh for white hill) and Mynydd Tarw ([ˈmɐnɨð ˈtæɾu], bull mountain).

The summit lies on the border between Powys and Denbighshire, and is the highest point in Denbighshire. The northern end of Craig Berwyn is the highest point in Wrexham County Borough.

==History==
There is a standing stone at SJ080337 near the summit between Cadair Berwyn and Tomle. It was re-erected in June 2008 by High Sports.

The Berwyn range also played its part in causing King Henry II of England to turn back during his invasion of Gwynedd in 1165. Rather than taking the usual route along the northern coastal plain, his army invaded from Oswestry and took a route over the Berwyns. The English invasion faced an alliance of Welsh princes led by King Owain Gwynedd, but there was little fighting – endless days of heavy rain forced the English to retreat.

==Alleged UFO crash==

At 8.38 pm on 23 January 1974, an earthquake of magnitude 3.5 was felt over a wide area of north Wales and as far as Liverpool. Since earthquakes are uncommon in the UK, it was not generally recognized for what it was, and since a number of unusual lights in the sky had been observed the same evening, it was considered possible that an aircraft had crashed, or a meteorite had impacted. Further confusion was caused by lights seen on the Berwyn Mountains, which subsequently turned out to have belonged to poachers.

==Ecology==
The area supports substantial populations of upland birds including raptors, such as the hen harrier (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;), merlin (&quot;Falco columbarius&quot;), and peregrine (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) (about 14–18 breeding pairs of each species, 1%–2% of the total British population), and for this reason it is a Special Protection Area classified in accordance with the European Union&#x27;s Birds Directive. Much of the area is also designated a national nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest and forms part of the Berwyn and South Clwyd Mountains Special Area of Conservation. Other wildlife include short-eared owl, raven, buzzard, polecat and golden plover.

==Etymology==
The scholar T. Gwynn Jones suggested that a possible origin of the term &quot;Berwyn&quot; was &quot;Bryn(iau) Gwyn (ap Nudd)&quot;, where the Middle Welsh word &quot;bre&quot; (hill) had mutated to &quot;Ber&quot; + &quot;Gwyn&quot;, Gwyn ap Nudd being the mythological King of the Tylwyth Teg (Fair Folk, or fairies). A more likely etymology is &quot;bar&quot; (summit, crest) + &quot;gwyn&quot; (white), with the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;bar&quot; showing i-affection as a result of the &quot;y&quot; in &quot;gwyn&quot;, therefore changing from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;e&quot;; the word also shows &quot;soft mutation&quot; of the letter &quot;g&quot; (which is deleted under soft mutation).

<doc id="228813" wikidata="Q764073" url="?curid=228813" title="Gyllene Tider">
<text>Gyllene Tider (; &quot;Golden Times&quot;) is a Swedish pop group fronted by Roxette singer, guitarist, and songwriter Per Gessle. They are one of the best-selling Swedish bands ever and have had numerous hits in Scandinavia, starting with their breakthrough song &quot;Flickorna på TV2&quot;, in 1980. Since breaking up in 1985, the band has held regular reunions, with the latest one taking place in 2023.

==History==
In 1976, Per Gessle met Mats Persson, a member of the band Audiovisuellt Angrepp, and they formed the duo Grape Rock. They were joined by Micke Syd Andersson, Anders Herrlin, and Göran Fritzon, and the quintet was born. They changed their name to Gyllene Tider, an allusion to Mott the Hoople&#x27;s song &quot;The Golden Age of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. In 1980, they released their self-titled debut album, which became a success in Sweden. &quot;Flickorna på TV2&quot; was the record&#x27;s biggest hit.

The band&#x27;s second album, released in 1981 under the name &quot;Moderna Tider&quot;, also enjoyed success and was followed by a national tour. The following year, Gyllene Tider issued &quot;Puls&quot;, which included the hits &quot;Sommartider&quot; and &quot;Flickan i en Cole-Porter-sång&quot;. In March 1985, the group broke up after releasing the English-language album &quot;The Heartland Cafe&quot;. Per Gessle continued with a solo career and formed Roxette with Marie Fredriksson in 1986.

Since Gyllene Tider&#x27;s breakup, several Platinum-selling compilation albums have been released, and a number of live reunions have taken place, starting with the Återtåget tour, in 1996. In 2004, the band celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary with the first new album in over twenty years and a summer tour in July and August.

Gyllene Tider reunited again on 14 August 2010 as a surprise encore during Roxette&#x27;s concert in Halmstad, both bands&#x27; hometown. They performed a three-song set consisting of &quot;Juni, Juli, Augusti&quot;, &quot;Sommartider&quot;, and &quot;När alla vännerna gått hem&quot;, with Marie Fredriksson and Roxette&#x27;s backing band joining onstage for the last number. In January 2013, the group announced a new album and summer tour in Sweden, both called &quot;Dags att tänka på refrängen&quot;. The record was released on 24 April 2013.

In January 2019, Gyllene Tider announced a farewell tour to celebrate forty years together. They released the album &quot;Samma skrot och korn&quot; the same year. In 2023, the band announced another tour as well as a new double album, titled &quot;Hux Flux&quot;, released in June.

<doc id="228816" wikidata="Q469801" url="?curid=228816" title="Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow">
<text>Tikhon of Moscow (, – ), born Vasily Ivanovich Bellavin (), was a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). On 5 November 1917 (OS) he was selected the 11th Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, after a period of about 200 years of the Synodal rule in the ROC. He was canonised as a confessor by the ROC in 1989.

==Early life==
From 1878 to 1884, Bellavin studied at the Pskov Theological Seminary. In 1888, at the age of 23, he graduated from the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy as a layman. He then returned to the Pskov Seminary and became an instructor of Moral and Dogmatic Theology. In 1891, at the age of 26, he took monastic vows and was given the name Tikhon in honor of St. Tikhon of Zadonsk. Tikhon was consecrated Bishop of Lublin on 19 October 1897.

==Bishop in the United States==
On 14 September 1898, he was appointed Bishop of the Aleutian Islands and Alaska. He went to the United States, and eventually became a naturalized American citizen. The peripatetic bishop visited emerging Orthodox emigrant communities in various American cities, including New York City, Chicago and the coal and steel-making cities in Pennsylvania and Ohio. 

As head of the ROC diocese in North America, in 1900 he reorganized the diocese and changed its name from the &quot;Of the Aleutian Islands and Alaska&quot; to &quot;Diocese of the Aleutian Islands and North America&quot;. He had two auxiliary bishops in the United States: Bishop Innocent (Pustynsky) in Alaska, and St. Raphael (Hawaweeny) in Brooklyn. On 22 May 1901, he blessed the cornerstone for St. Nicholas Cathedral in New York City (fundraising for which had begun in 1894 and to which Tsar Nicholas II contributed $5,000 in 1900) in a great ceremony attended by New York Mayor Seth Low, Russian diplomats and sailors, and enthusiastic worshippers. He celebrated the first liturgy in the new building&#x27;s basement on July 20, 1902, and in the main hall on November 10, 1902. Tikhon was also involved in building other churches in North America, and establishing a dialog with Greek Orthodox churches in America. On 9 November 1902, he consecrated the church of St. Nicholas in Brooklyn for Syrian Antiochian Orthodox immigrants.

While in the United States, Tikhon became aware of the country&#x27;s tradition of religious diversity, as well as the growing ecumenical and Pan-Slav movements, and the needs of a wide variety of eastern and southern European immigrants. Before his arrival, in 1890, a delegation of Carpatho-Rusyns also had approached the Russian consul in San Francisco and requested a bishop, since the Latin Catholic archbishop of Minnesota, John Ireland was attempting to force their assimilation, although Byzantine Rite Catholics had previously been accorded certain dispensations from the Roman Rite practices of the Latin Church. Their Byzantine (Ruthenian) Catholic priest, Alexis Toth, was formally accepted into the Russian Orthodox Church in 1892. In 1900, Tikhon attended the consecration of Reginald Heber Weller as coadjutor bishop for the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac, though he was not one of the consecrating bishops (all Episcopalians). More Byzantine Catholics joined the Eastern Orthodox fold, especially priests after 1907, when Pope Pius X published &quot;Ea Semper&quot;, restricting their previously recognized right to ordain married men.

In 1905, the title of archbishop was bestowed on him, and he moved his formal residence and diocesan office from San Francisco to New York. In June 1905, the new archbishop gave his blessing for the establishment of a monastery in Pennsylvania, St. Tikhon&#x27;s Monastery which in the 1930s supported the founding of Saint Tikhon&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary. On The Holy Trinity Russian (Greek) Orthodox church was consecrated in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, on the corner of McKenzie Street and Manitoba Avenue by the new archbishop Tikhon, Head of the Russian Orthodox Mission in North America and soon to become Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. Ukrainian teachers studying at the Ruthenian Training School sang at the consecration ceremony.

==Return to Russia and restoration of the Patriarchate==
In 1907, Tikhon returned to Russia, having been appointed to the See of Yaroslavl. On 22 December 1913, he was transferred to the diocese of Vilno in Lithuania.

However, the First World War and the Russian Revolution created turmoil in his native land. On 21 June 1917, the Diocesan Congress of clergy and laity elected Tikhon the ruling bishop of Moscow. On 14 August 1917 (OS), Tikhon was raised to the dignity of Metropolitan of Moscow. On the next day, the Local Council of the ROC, the first such convention since the late 17th century, opened in Moscow. The council&#x27;s major decision that passed on 28 October 1917, days after the Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd, was to restore the Patriarchy in the ROC. On 5 November 1917, after his election by vote as one of the three candidates for the reinstated Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Vladimir of Kiev announced that Metropolitan Tikhon had been selected for the position after a drawing of lots as the new Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia.

==Patriarchate==
During the Russian Civil War the patriarch, like the entire Russian Church, was widely considered anti-Bolshevik and many bishops were exiled, imprisoned or even executed by the new regime. Tikhon openly condemned the murder of the tsar&#x27;s family in 1918, and protested against violent attacks by the Bolsheviks on the church. In 1920, he granted autonomy to what became the Orthodox Church in America and other dioceses of the Church of Russia that were cut off from the governance of the highest church authority (i.e. the patriarch), until such time as normal relations with the highest church authority could be resumed.In November 1921, many of the Russian bishops, who had fled Russia in 1919–1920, had gathered in Sremski Karlovci, Yugoslavia, and adopted a number of anti-Bolshevik statements; in May relations between the two bodies became irregular. The Russian Orthodox Church Abroad (ROCOR) and the Moscow Patriarchate had no formal relations until 2007.
In 1922 Russia was afflicted with mass famine. The Communist government used the situation to confiscate ecclesiastical property and to accuse the patriarch of being a saboteur. From April 1922 until June 1923 he resided under house arrest in Donskoy Monastery. His public protest against nationalization of Church property was reframed as a criminal act. This caused international resonance and several countries sent formal protest notes to the Soviet government.

Under pressure from the authorities, Tikhon issued several messages to the believers in which he stated in part that he was &quot;no longer an enemy to the Soviet power&quot;. Textual analysis of these messages shows considerable similarity with a number of documents exchanged in the Politburo on the &quot;Tikhon Affair&quot;. Despite his declaration of loyalty, he continued to enjoy the trust of the Orthodox community in Russia. In 1923 Tikhon was &quot;deposed&quot; by a Soviet-sponsored council of the so-called Living Church, which decreed that he was &quot;henceforth a simple citizen—Vasily Bellavin.&quot; This deposition has never been recognized as an act of the Russian Orthodox Church, and is therefore considered invalid by both the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Federation.

==Death==
In 1924 the patriarch fell ill and was hospitalized. On 5 April 1925, he served his last Divine Liturgy and died two days later on 25 March (OS)/7 April, the Feast of the Annunciation. He was buried on 12 April in the winter church of Donskoy Monastery in Moscow. From the time of his death, he was widely considered a martyr or confessor for the faith.

==Canonization==


Tikhon was glorified (canonized) a saint by the Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia in conjunction with the great glorification of the New Martyrs and Confessors of the Soviet Yoke on . He was later glorified by the Moscow Patriarchate during the Bishop&#x27;s Council of 9–11 October 1989. This later canonization process is generally considered an example of the thaw in church–Soviet relations during the Glasnost era. The American Episcopal Church along with the Anglican Church in North America remember Tikhon with a feast day on their liturgical calendars on the anniversary of his death, April 7.

St Tikhon&#x27;s relics were believed lost, but on 19 February 1992 his coffin was found in a hidden crypt in the Donskoy Monastery and on 22 February, the coffin was opened and his relics were discovered to be almost entirely incorrupt. The relics were placed in a reliquary and on , fifty bishops solemnly transferred them to the Katholikon (main church) of the Donskoy Monastery in a place of honour by the soleas (close to the sanctuary).

St. Tikhon is the patron saint of the Orthodox Western Rite.

<text>Lester Neil Smith III (May 12, 1946 – August 27, 2021), better known as L. Neil Smith, was an American libertarian science fiction author and political activist. His works include the trilogy of Lando Calrissian novels, all published in 1983: &quot;Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu&quot;, &quot;Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon&quot;, and &quot;Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka&quot;. He also wrote the novels &quot;Pallas&quot;, &quot;The Forge of the Elders&quot;, and &quot;The Probability Broach&quot;, each of which won the Libertarian Futurist Society&#x27;s annual Prometheus Award (which Smith personally created) for best libertarian science fiction novel. In 2016, Smith received a Special Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Libertarian Futurist Society.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Denver, Colorado on May 12, 1946. His father was an Air Force officer, and his childhood was spent in various places including Waco, McQueenie, and La Porte, Texas; Salina, Kansas; Sacramento, California; and Gifford, Illinois (all before he completed fifth grade) and then St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Ft. Walton Beach, Florida, where he graduated from high school.

==Writing career==
===North American Confederacy series===
Several of Smith&#x27;s works are set in his North American Confederacy universe:
* &quot;The Probability Broach&quot; (1980) is an alternate history novel in which history has taken a different turn because a single word in the Declaration of Independence was changed. The United States has become replaced by a minarchist/libertarian society, the North American Confederacy, in this parallel universe, also known to science fiction fans as the Gallatin Universe because of the pivotal role of Albert Gallatin during the point of divergence in 1794. The antagonists of the series are styled Federalists, or sometimes &quot;Hamiltonians&quot;, after the historical political party of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. In 2004, a graphic novel version was released, illustrated by Scott Bieser.
* &quot;The Venus Belt&quot; (1980) takes place in outer space and discusses other settlements in the Gallatin Universe solar system. The Federalists are attempting to base a new civilization in interstellar space, kidnapping and enslaving a quarter of a million women as breeding stock from the anti-libertarian timeline from which the viewpoint character of &quot;The Probability Broach&quot; had escaped, with a plan to someday return in force to take over both of the alternate versions of Earth discovered by way of the P&#x27;wheet/Thorens probability broach.
* &quot;Their Majesties&#x27; Bucketeers&quot; (1981) is a pastiche of the Sherlock Holmes tales by Arthur Conan Doyle, introducing the Lamviin, a trilaterally symmetrical race of aliens native to the arid planet of Sodde Lydfe. &quot;Their Majesties&#x27; Bucketeers&quot; introduces characters who later interact with others in the Gallatin Universe.
* &quot;The Nagasaki Vector&quot; (1983) is written from the perspective of a time traveler who is shifted from yet another alternative probability line into the Gallatin Universe by the nuclear explosion over Nagasaki (on August 9, 1945) during World War II.
* In &quot;Tom Paine Maru&quot; (1984), entrepreneurs of the Confederacy travel from world to world, exploring the various kinds of messes made by the Federalists who had been shifted back in time and scattered at random over the universe at the conclusion of &quot;The Venus Belt&quot;. The Federalists had created dozens of colonies, all of which had suffered disaster and retrogression under Federalist rule. Smith uses this device to criticize non-libertarian forms of government.
* In &quot;The Gallatin Divergence&quot; (1985), a time-traveling Federalist woman wants to change history but is opposed by the protagonists of &quot;The Probability Broach&quot;. As these two forces clash, history is once again altered and yet another timeline is created.
* &quot;The American Zone&quot; (2001), the final book in the series, is a direct sequel to &quot;The Probability Broach&quot; concerned with the refugees from various anti-libertarian versions of the United States who take up residence in the Confederacy, and the response of the Confederacy to terrorist violence.

===Star Wars expanded universe novels===
Smith wrote three novels set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe. All three feature con-artist, associate of Han Solo and previous owner of the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, Lando Calrissian, first introduced in the film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. The novels take place between &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope:&quot;

* &quot;Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu&quot; (July 1983), the first novel in the series, follows Calrissian as he wins a droid, Vuffi Raa, in a sabacc game, but must travel to the Rafa system to claim it, where he is forced by Rokur Gepta into a quest for an ancient artifact.
* &quot;Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon&quot; (October 1983), picks up with Calrissian and Vuffi Raa some time later, having started a freight business. Calrissian is invited to a high-stakes sabacc game in the Oseon system, where circumstances require him to assist in a drug sting, while defending against Rokur Gepta&#x27;s revenge.
* In &quot;Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka&quot; (December 1983), Calrissian and Vuffi Raa assist a persecuted alien race facing starvation instigated by the Centrality, and learn about Vuffi&#x27;s origins.

The three novels were collected as &quot;The Lando Calrissian Adventures&quot; Omnibus Edition (1994).

===Other works===
* &quot;Pallas&quot; was conceived as the first installment of a series that Smith called &quot;The Ngu Family Saga&quot;. &quot;Pallas&quot; is the story of Emerson Ngu, a boy who lives in a dystopian socialist commune in a crater on the asteroid Pallas. Emerson secretly builds a crystal radio and is astonished to learn of the world outside the commune. Escaping, he discovers that the rest of Pallas is a libertarian utopia. Unable to forget his semi-enslaved family—whose &quot;workers&#x27; paradise&quot; is slowly starving to death—he designs a cheap but durable gun (because the libertarians on Pallas, to their shame, did not have a domestic firearms industry), and sets about liberating his former commune. At the same time, he must learn the skills necessary for life in the outside world. The novel thus functions both as a bildungsroman and a story of political revolution.
* The writing of &quot;Ceres&quot;, the second work in &quot;The Ngu Family Saga,&quot; was funded by private investors organized as Project Ceres by Alan R. Weiss, a friend of Smith&#x27;s. The plot centers on a figure skater from a small asteroid who is determined to compete successfully in the much heavier gravity of Earth, and her brother, pursuing mineral riches as an &quot;asteroid hunter&quot;.
* &quot;The Mitzvah&quot;, a novel about a Catholic priest who is a pacifist and influenced by socialist values of the 1960s. His world is shattered when he learns that the German immigrant parents he grew up with have adopted him, and his true parents were a Jewish couple murdered in the Holocaust.

==Politics==
Smith joined the Libertarian Party in 1972 (just after its beginnings in 1971). He served on the Platform Committee in 1977 and 1979, and in 1978 ran for the state legislature in Colorado, losing to Ronald Strahle by 10,895 votes to 1,925.

In 1999, Smith announced that he would run for president in 2000 as an independent if his supporters would gather 1,000,000 online petition signatures asking him to run. After failing to achieve even 1,500 signatures, his independent campaign quietly died. He next tried an abortive run for the Libertarian Party nomination, which ended almost as quickly when, in the California primary, Harry Browne overwhelmingly defeated him, 71% to 9%.

Although Browne was chosen by the party&#x27;s 2000 national convention, Smith, because of a dispute between the Libertarian Party&#x27;s national organization and its Arizona affiliate, appeared as the Libertarian Party candidate for president on the Arizona ballot. He and running mate Vin Suprynowicz received 5,775 votes in the national election, less than 0.01% of the vote. Shortly thereafter, Smith&#x27;s supporters announced a new 1,000,000-signature petition drive; however, in late 2003, with the new drive once again failing to achieve even a small fraction of that total, Smith announced that he would not pursue another political office.

Smith endorsed the Free State Project and Badnarik&#x27;s campaign for president in 2004.

Smith is the founder of, and regularly contributed essays to, &quot;The Libertarian Enterprise&quot;, an anarcho-capitalist and paleolibertarian journal.

<doc id="228822" wikidata="Q825932" url="?curid=228822" title="New Jersey Route 133">
<text>Route 133 (also known as the Hightstown Bypass) is a freeway located entirely in East Windsor, Mercer County, New Jersey, in the United States. The route runs as a four-lane bypass of Hightstown from Princeton-Hightstown Road (County Route 571 [CR 571]) and Windsor Center Drive to the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95 [I-95]) at exit 8. Originally, Route 133 did not have any direct connections to any other freeways until a new turnpike interchange opened in January 2013.

The plans for the original bypass of Hightstown originated in 1929, when locals looked for a way to remove traffic from downtown. The New Jersey State Legislature followed up in 1938 by designating a new spur off of State Highway Route 31 (then part of U.S. Route 206 [US 206]), State Highway Route 31A as a freeway from Princeton to the Jersey Shore. During the 1970s, the highway proposed as Route 92 gained momentum, running from Princeton (at I-95&#x27;s proposed Somerset Freeway) all the way to Route 33 at Hightstown. However, after several setbacks, Route 92 was moved northward in 1988 and the bypass was truncated to a short portion of highway bypassing Hightstown. Construction on the new $57 million Route 133 commenced on September 20, 1996, and was completed and opened on November 30, 1999.

==Route description==

Route 133 begins at an at-grade intersection with Princeton-Hightstown Road (CR 571) and Windsor Center Drive in East Windsor. The intersection includes a jughandle for eastbound traffic to use to access the highway. After the jughandle allowing westbound CR 571 traffic to access Windsor Center Drive which continues southwest from the freeway, Route 133 begins to progress its way northward as a four-lane freeway, crossing through surroundings of trees and open fields. Along a large bend, the highway turns eastward, paralleling to CR 571 to the south and Old Trenton Road (CR 535) to the north. Passing to the southeast of a McGraw Hill Financial office building, Route 133 curves to the southeast through fields and crosses over the locally maintained One Mile Road heading eastbound and interchanges westbound. Heading eastbound, the on-ramp to Route 133 from One Mile Road merges in, and the highway continues, passing to the north of homes and commercial buildings through East Windsor.
A short distance later, Route 133 crosses over Rocky Brook. The highway&#x27;s surroundings then change drastically, with residential homes surrounding the freeway in each direction (though blocked from view by trees and noise barriers). A short distance later, Route 133 crosses over US 130 with a cloverleaf interchange with some movements missing. After US 130, the highway continues eastward, crossing over North Main Street (CR 539). The highway crosses the right-of-way of the historic Camden and Amboy Railroad; there is no bridge over the trackbed that is abandoned only a short few feet to the north and a few miles south around the Hightstown area. Route 133 turns to the southeast once again, continuing to the south of a condominium complex. Leaving the condos behind, the highway turns southward through lands and runs parallel to the south of Cranbury Station Road. Route 133 continues southward, crossing over Wyckoff Mills Road, which serves as the southern terminus of Cranbury Station Road. As the road parallels Wyckoff Mills Road, the four-lane freeway continues eastward, crossing over the 12 lanes of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). (The Route 133 bridge over the turnpike was built with provisions for the New Jersey Turnpike to be widened with additional sets of three lanes in each direction, which was completed in November 2014.) To the south of Wyckoff Mills Road, Route 133 continues as a four-lane freeway. Soon after, Route 133 turns southward, heading away from Wyckoff Mills Road and reaches a single-point urban interchange with Route 33. The mainline of Route 133 becomes the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority as it passes over Route 33 and heads underneath Milford Road before ending at the toll plaza for exit 8 of the turnpike. The roadway past the toll plaza becomes part of the trumpet interchange for the turnpike.

==History==

===Route 92, the original proposal===
The original concept for a bypass of Hightstown dates back to 1929, when local members of community requested a solution to relieve traffic on current-day CR 571 away from the downtown. However, nothing was ever produced, until 1938, when the New Jersey State Legislature designated State Highway Route 31A, a modern expressway crossing from the borough of Princeton eastward to Hightstown and further to the Atlantic Ocean along current-day Route 33. In 1950, Governor Alfred E. Driscoll promoted the statewide expressway, citing that &quot;it is unwise to expect city streets to bear the brunt of through, truck and passenger traffic.&quot; However, State Highway Route 31A was truncated in the 1953 state highway renumbering to a short portion of highway in West Windsor as Route 64.
During the 1950s, the New Jersey State Highway Department released plans to construct the Princeton–Hightstown Bypass, a , four-lane freeway connecting US 206 in the Montgomery Township community of Skillman to Route 33 in East Windsor. The freeway, designated as Route 92, was to connect US 206 with Route 27, US 1, and US 130, Route 33 and the New Jersey Turnpike. While the eastern terminus was to be at the New Jersey Turnpike, the western terminus of Route 92 was to be at an interchange with the Somerset Freeway (I-95) near Rocky Hill. Although plans for Route 92 remained, the Somerset Freeway proposal was decommissioned in 1982, leaving open funds for use on other projects. The New Jersey Department of Transportation suggested serving funds to the Route 92 project along with five other transportation projects. The project was working on its final studies and proposals in 1986, which was the year new interstates could be proposed to the Federal Highway Administration, however, the portion west of US 1 was dropped from the plans a year later.

===The down-scaled route===

After Route 92 was shifted northward by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) due to the belief that it would better serve residents further north, the proposal went into shadows. In 1994, six years after plans changed for the Route 92 Freeway, NJDOT revived the plans, attempting to build the freeway from Princeton to Hightstown. However, the next year, the plan had to be altered due to public opposition from the communities of Princeton and Plainsboro. This plan was to construct a bypass of Hightstown and East Windsor, now designated as Route 133. The bid for the construction of the new four-lane freeway was accepted from the Schiavone Construction Company in 1996 for a cost of $57 million (equivalent to $ in ). Design began that June and construction of the new freeway started on September 20. The project was constructed as New Jersey&#x27;s first modified-design–build freeway, which helped save money and costs for construction, reducing 26 months off the average construction time for the style of freeway. On November 30, 1999, the roadway, which was completed, was opened to commuter traffic, over a year later than originally estimated (July 1998). Part of this delay was due to passage of Hurricane Floyd over the region during September 1999, whose heavy rains resulted in substantial erosion at the project site. At the time of the opening, the freeway carried a speed limit; this was increased to in August 2001.

===Extension to the New Jersey Turnpike===
On December 31, 2006, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) released its proposals regarding exit 8 of the New Jersey Turnpike and its possible replacement. The current exit 8 would be demolished and replaced with a new interchange. The new exit 8 would end at the intersection with Route 33, Milford Road, and the Route 133 bypass (on the east side of the expressway, instead of the west). This new exit 8 would grant direct access to the bypass (without going through any traffic lights), as well as to Route 33, using grade-separated interchanges. The new toll gate would feature a total of 12 booths at the toll gate. The second option would be a grade-separated diamond interchange would be constructed, which would lead the ramps towards Route 33. At the intersection with Route 33 and the interchange ramps (from the turnpike and Route 133), a traffic signal would be built underneath the exit 8 ramps/Route 133. In lieu of a connector road, a jughandle would be built on Route 33 west. This would intersect at Route 33 (with a traffic light) and become the relocated Milford Road (after crossing Route 33).
The third option was an unusual cloverleaf interchange would be built in lieu of a diamond interchange. After exiting the turnpike from the toll gate, a ramp on the right would lead to Milford Road or Route 33. The mainline of the turnpike ramp would cross over Route 33 and turn into Route 133. A relocated Milford Road would be built across from Monmouth Street (CR 633) and Route  33 (without connecting Monmouth Street and Milford Road) towards the intersection with the current Milford Road and Daniel Street. The new Milford would cross over the turnpike ramps. A leaf would be built from the turnpike ramp approaching the exit 8 toll gate, which would connect to Milford Road. An entrance ramp would be constructed from Milford Road to the exit 8 toll gate. Traveling north on Milford Road, a ramp would be constructed, which would diverge into two ways; one way would merge into the turnpike ramp heading towards Route 133, and the other would intersect at a new traffic light at Route 33, east of the current Route 33/Route 133/Milford Road intersection.

Ultimately, the NJTA chose the first option for the interchange. But the connector road was eliminated and an exit ramp from the new tollgate to Milford Road south was added to the proposal.

The new exit 8 interchange and toll plaza partially opened in January 2013 with a combination of some temporary and some permanent ramps connecting to the turnpike, at which point the old interchange was closed, though the old interchange remains in use to access an maintenance depot. The new overpass crossing over Route 33 was opened in September 2013, followed by completion of the interchange by 2014.

<text>Ralph Adams Cram (December 16, 1863 – September 22, 1942) was a prolific and influential American architect of collegiate and ecclesiastical buildings, often in the Gothic Revival style. Cram &amp; Ferguson and Cram, Goodhue &amp; Ferguson are partnerships in which he worked. Cram was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects.

==Early life==
Cram was born on December 16, 1863, at Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, to William Augustine Cram and Sarah Elizabeth (Blake) Cram. He was educated at Westford Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy. He was a cousin of Ralph Warren Cram.

At age 18, Cram moved to Boston in 1881 and worked for five years in the architectural office of Rotch &amp; Tilden, after which he left for Rome to study classical architecture. From 1885 to 1887, he was art critic for the &quot;Boston Transcript&quot;. During an 1887 Christmas Eve Mass in Rome, he had a dramatic conversion experience. For the rest of his life, he practiced as a fervent Anglo-Catholic who identified as high-church Anglican. In the 1890s, Cram was a key figure in &quot;social-controversial-inspirational&quot; groups including the Pewter Mugs and the Visionists.

In 1900, Cram married Elizabeth Carrington Read at New Bedford, Massachusetts. She was the daughter of Clement Carrington Read and his wife. Read had served as a captain in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. Elizabeth and Ralph had three children, Mary Carrington Cram, Ralph Wentworth Cram and Elizabeth Strudwick Cram. The family burial site is at the St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Memorial Churchyard. The churchyard is adjacent to St Elizabeth&#x27;s Chapel, which Cram designed, in Sudbury, Massachusetts, where he lived later in life.

==Career==

Cram and business partner Charles Wentworth started business in Boston in April 1889 as Cram and Wentworth. They had landed only four or five church commissions before they were joined by Bertram Goodhue in 1892 to form Cram, Wentworth and Goodhue. Goodhue brought an award-winning commission in Dallas (never built) and brilliant drafting skills to the Boston office.

Wentworth died in 1897 and the firm&#x27;s name changed to Cram, Goodhue &amp; Ferguson to include draftsman Frank W. Ferguson (1861–1926). Cram and Goodhue complemented each other&#x27;s strengths at first but began to compete, sometimes submitting two differing proposals for the same commission. The firm won design of the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1902, a major milestone in their career. They set up the firm&#x27;s New York office, where Goodhue would preside, leaving Cram to operate in Boston. He designed the sanctuary for the First Unitarian Society in Newton which represents elements of his signature ecclesiastical style and was built in 1905. From 1907 to 1909, Cram was the editor of &quot;Christian Art&quot;.

Cram&#x27;s acceptance of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine commission in New York City in 1911 (on Goodhue&#x27;s perceived territory) heightened the tension between the two. Architectural historians have attributed most of their projects to one partner or the other, based on the visual and compositional style, and the location. The Gothic Revival Saint Thomas Church was designed by them both in 1914 on Manhattan&#x27;s Fifth Avenue. It is the last example of their collaboration, and the most integrated and strongest example of their work together.

Goodhue began his solo career on August 14, 1913. Cram and Ferguson continued with major church and college commissions through the 1930s. Particularly important work includes the original campus of Rice University, Houston, as well as the library and first city hall of that city. Also notable is Cram&#x27;s first church in the Boston area, All Saints, Dorchester. The successor firm is HDB/Cram and Ferguson of Boston.

A leading proponent of disciplined Gothic Revival architecture in general and Collegiate Gothic in particular, Cram is most closely associated with Princeton University, where he served as supervising architect from 1907 to 1929, during a period of major construction. The university awarded him a Doctor of Letters for his achievements. In 1907, he served as chairman of the American Institute of Architects&#x27; Committee on Education.

For seven years he headed the Architectural Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Through the 1920s, Cram was a public figure and frequently mentioned in the press. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;one of the most prominent Episcopalian laymen in the country&quot;. His work was part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

He made news with his defense of Al Smith during his electoral campaign, when anti-Catholic rhetoric was used, saying &quot;I... express my disgust at the ignorance and superstition now rampant and in order that I may go on record as another of those who, though not Roman Catholics, are nevertheless Americans and are outraged by this recrudescence of blatant bigotry, operating through the most cowardly and contemptible methods.&quot;

In around 1932, he designed the Desloge Chapel in St. Louis, MO, the Gothic chapel designed to echo the contours of the St. Chapelle in Paris. Desloge Chapel, which is associated with the Firmin Desloge Hospital and St. Louis University, in 1983, was declared a landmark by the Missouri Historical Society. In 1938, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.

==Views==
===Modernism===
As an author, lecturer, and architect, Cram propounded the view that the Renaissance had been, at least in part, an unfortunate detour for western culture. Cram argued that authentic development could come only by returning to Gothic sources for inspiration, as his &quot;Collegiate Gothic&quot; architecture did, with considerable success. For his Rice University buildings, he favored a medieval north Italian Romanesque style, more in keeping with Houston&#x27;s hot, humid climate.

A modernist in many ways, he designed Art Deco landmarks of great distinction, including the Federal Building skyscraper in Boston and numerous churches. For example, his design of the tower of the East Liberty Presbyterian Church, Pittsburgh, was inspired by the Empire State Building. His work at Rice was as modernist as medieval in inspiration. His administration building, his secular masterwork, has been compared by Shand-Tucci to Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s work, particularly in the way its dramatic horizontality reflects the surrounding prairies.

The architectural historian Sandy Isenstadt wrote in a review of Cram&#x27;s biography that &quot;... (modernist) disdain (of Cram) turned out to be modernism&#x27;s loss&quot;. Peter Cormack, director of London&#x27;s William Morris Gallery, said regarding the critical neglect of Cram&#x27;s work that it was &quot;a phenomenon which has significantly distorted the study of America&#x27;s modern architectural history... (Cram) deserves the same kind of international--and domestic--recognition accorded (all too often uncritically) to his contemporary Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;.

===Politics===
Cram argued that the United States would be better off under a Semi-constitutional monarchy, with the right to vote restricted to white men who owned a sufficient level of property. He lays out some of his monarchist beliefs in his work &quot;Invitation to Monarchy&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The American Mercury&quot; in 1936.

===Religion===
Raised Unitarian, Cram converted to Anglo-Catholicism after a youthful visit to Rome. He later joined The Episcopal Church in the United States upon returning to his home country. Throughout his life, Cram was devoted to liturgical and devotional practices revived by Anglo-Catholicism, including the cultus of King Charles the Martyr. He, along with other Anglo-Catholics, viewed Anglicanism as a &quot;branch&quot; of the one true Church, alongside the Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, and hoped for eventual unification with Rome.

Cram also co-founded the American branches of the Society of King Charles the Martyr and the Order of the White Rose. Traveling through Europe, Cram also befriended Catholic writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton, who have been accredited with influencing his views. He later became involved with a number of American Roman Catholic enterprises and co-founded the Catholic magazine Commonweal. Cram accepted papal primacy and frequently defended Catholicism against American anti-Catholic prejudice, though he never converted to the religion itself.

Cram also wrote fiction. A number of his stories, notably &quot;The Dead Valley&quot;, were published in a collection entitled &quot;Black Spirits and White&quot; (Stone &amp; Kimball, 1895). The collection has been called &quot;one of the undeniable classics of weird fiction&quot;. H. P. Lovecraft wrote, &quot;In &#x27;The Dead Valley&#x27; the eminent architect and mediævalist Ralph Adams Cram achieves a memorably potent degree of vague regional horror through subtleties of atmosphere and description.&quot; Henry S. Whitehead described &quot;Black Spirits and White&quot; as &quot;a delightful rendition of several characterstic ghost stories.&quot;

<text>Teenage pregnancy, also known as adolescent pregnancy, is pregnancy in a female under the age of 20. 

Worldwide, pregnancy complications are the leading cause of death for women and girls 15 to 19 years old. The definition of teenage pregnancy includes those who are legally considered adults in their country. The World Health Organization defines &quot;adolescence&quot; as the period between the ages of 10 and 19 years. Pregnancy can occur with sexual intercourse after the start of ovulation, which can happen before the first menstrual period (&quot;menarche&quot;). In healthy, well-nourished girls, the first period usually takes place between the ages of 12 and 13.
Pregnant teenagers face many of the same pregnancy-related issues as older women. Teenagers are more likely to experience pregnancy complications or maternal death than women aged 20 or older. There are additional concerns for those under the age of 15 as they are less likely to be physically developed to sustain a healthy pregnancy or to give birth. For girls aged 15–19, risks are associated more with socioeconomic factors than with the biological effects of age. Risks of low birth weight, premature labor, anemia, and pre-eclampsia are not connected to biological age by the time a girl is aged 16, as they are not observed in births to older teens after controlling for other risk factors, such as access to high-quality prenatal care.
Teenage pregnancies are related to social issues, including lower educational levels and poverty. Teenage pregnancy in developed countries is usually outside of marriage and is often associated with a social stigma. Teenage pregnancy in developing countries often occurs within marriage and approximately half are planned. However, in these societies, early pregnancy may combine with malnutrition and poor health care to cause medical problems. When used in combination, educational interventions and access to birth control can reduce unintended teenage pregnancies.
In 2023, globally, about 41 females per 1,000 gave birth between the ages of 15 and 19, compared with roughly 65 births per 1,000 in 2000. From 2015 to 2021, an estimated 14 percent of adolescent girls and young women globally reported giving birth before age 18. The adolescent birth rate is higher in lower- and middle-income countries (LMIC), compared to higher- income countries. In the developing world, approximately 2.5 million females aged 15 to 19 years old have children each year. Another 3.9 million have abortions. It is more common in rural than urban areas.

In 2021, 13.3 million babies, or about 10 percent of the total worldwide, were born to mothers under 20 years old.

==Definition==
The World Health Organization defines adolescence as the period between the ages of 10 and 19 years.

The mother&#x27;s age is determined by the easily verified date when the pregnancy &quot;ends&quot;, not by the estimated date of conception. Consequently, the statistics do not include pregnancies that began at age 19, but that ended on or after the woman&#x27;s 20th birthday. Similarly, statistics on the mother&#x27;s marital status are determined by whether she is married at the end of the pregnancy, not at the time of conception.

==History==
Teenage pregnancy, with conceptions normally involving girls between ages 16 and 19, was far more normal in previous centuries, and common in developed countries in the 20th century. Among Norwegian women born in the early 1950s, nearly a quarter became teenage mothers by the early 1970s. The rates have steadily declined throughout the developed world since that 20th-century peak. Among those born in Norway in the late 1970s, less than 10% became teenage mothers, and rates have fallen since then.

In the United States, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 included the objective of reducing the number of young Black and Latina single mothers on welfare, which became the foundation for teenage pregnancy prevention in the United States and the founding of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, now known as Power to Decide.

==Effects==
According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), &quot;Pregnancies among girls less than 18 years of age have irreparable consequences. It violates the rights of girls, with life-threatening consequences in terms of sexual and reproductive health, and poses high development costs for communities, particularly in perpetuating the cycle of poverty.&quot; Health consequences include not yet being physically ready for pregnancy and childbirth leading to complications and malnutrition as the majority of adolescents tend to come from lower-income households. The risk of maternal death for girls under age 15 in low and middle income countries is higher than for women in their twenties. Teenage pregnancy also affects girls&#x27; education and income potential as many are forced to drop out of school which ultimately threatens future opportunities and economic prospects.

Studies have examined the socioeconomic, medical, and psychological impact of pregnancy and parenthood in teens. Life outcomes for teenage mothers and their children vary. Other factors, such as poverty or social support, may be more important than the age of the mother at the birth. Many solutions to counteract the more negative findings have been proposed. Teenage parents who can rely on family and community support, social services and child-care support are more likely to continue their education and get higher paying jobs as they progress with their education.

A holistic approach is required in order to address teenage pregnancy. This means not focusing on changing the behaviour of girls but addressing the underlying reasons of adolescent pregnancy such as poverty, gender inequality, social pressures and coercion. This approach should include &quot;providing age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education for all young people, investing in girls&#x27; education, preventing child marriage, sexual violence and coercion, building gender-equitable societies by empowering girls and engaging men and boys and ensuring adolescents&#x27; access to sexual and reproductive health information as well as services that welcome them and facilitate their choices&quot;.

In the United States one third of high school students reported being sexually active. In 2011–2013, 79% of females reported using birth control. Teenage pregnancy puts young women at risk for health issues, economic, social and financial issues.

===Teenager===
Being a young mother in a first world country can affect one&#x27;s education. Teen mothers are more likely to drop out of high school. A 2001 study found that women who gave birth during their teens completed secondary-level schooling 10–12% as often and pursued post-secondary education 14–29% as often as women who waited until age 30.
&quot;Young motherhood&quot; in an industrialized country can affect employment and social class. A 2009 study found that teenage girls who are pregnant or are mothers are seven times more likely to commit suicide than other teenagers.

According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, nearly 1 in 4 teen mothers will experience another pregnancy within two years of having their first. Pregnancy and giving birth significantly increases the chance that these mothers will become high school dropouts and as many as half have to go on welfare. Many teen parents do not have the intellectual or emotional maturity that is needed to provide for another life. Often, these pregnancies are hidden for months, resulting in a lack of adequate prenatal care and dangerous outcomes for the babies. Factors that determine which mothers are more likely to have closely spaced repeat births, include marriage and education. The likelihood decreases with the level of education of the young woman – or her parents – and increases if she gets married.

===Child===
Early motherhood can affect the psychosocial development of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions. Children of teen mothers are at higher risk of intellectual, language, and socio-emotional delays. Developmental disabilities and behavioral issues are increased in children born to teen mothers. One study suggested that adolescent mothers are less likely to stimulate their infant through affectionate behaviors such as touch, smiling, and verbal communication, or to be sensitive and accepting toward their needs. Another found that those who had more social support were less likely to show anger toward their children or to rely upon punishment.

Poor academic performance in the children of teenage mothers has also been noted, with many of the children being held back a grade level, scoring lower on standardized tests, and/or failing to graduate from secondary school. Daughters born to adolescent parents are more likely to become teen mothers themselves. Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to serve time in prison.

===Medical===
===Prenatal care===
Maternal and prenatal health is of particular concern among teens who are pregnant or parenting. The worldwide incidence of premature birth and low birth weight is higher among adolescent mothers. In a rural hospital in West Bengal, teenage mothers between 15 and 19 years old were more likely to have anemia, preterm delivery, and a baby with a lower birth weight than mothers between 20 and 24 years old.

Research indicates that pregnant teens are less likely to receive prenatal care, often seeking it in the third trimester, if at all. The Guttmacher Institute reports that one-third of pregnant teens receive insufficient prenatal care and that their children are more likely to have health issues in childhood or be hospitalized than those born to older women.

In the United States, teenage Latinas who become pregnant face barriers to receiving healthcare because they are the least insured group in the country.

Young mothers who are given high-quality maternity care have significantly healthier babies than those who do not. Many of the health-issues associated with teenage mothers appear to result from lack of access to adequate medical care.

Many pregnant teens are at risk of nutritional deficiencies from poor eating habits common in adolescence, including attempts to lose weight through dieting, skipping meals, food faddism, snacking, and consumption of fast food.

Inadequate nutrition during pregnancy is an even more marked problem among teenagers in developing countries. Complications of pregnancy result in the deaths of an estimated 70,000 teen girls in developing countries each year. Young mothers and their babies are also at greater risk of contracting HIV. The World Health Organization estimates that the risk of death following pregnancy is twice as high for girls aged 15–19 than for women aged 20–24. The maternal mortality rate can be up to five times higher for girls aged 10–14 than for women aged 20–24. Illegal abortion also holds many risks for teenage girls in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa.

Risks for medical complications are greater for girls aged under 15, as an underdeveloped pelvis can lead to difficulties in childbirth. Obstructed labour is normally dealt with by caesarean section in industrialized nations. In developing regions where medical services might be unavailable, it can lead to eclampsia, obstetric fistula, infant mortality, or maternal death. For mothers who are older than fifteen, age is not a risk factor, and poor outcomes are associated more with socioeconomic factors rather than with biology.

===Antenatal care===
In 2022, UNICEF noted that:

The agency noted regional disparities, noting that in West and Central Africa, &quot;48 percent of newborns to adolescent mothers had a postnatal contact as compared to 52 percent of newborns to all mothers&quot;.

===Economics===

The lifetime opportunity cost caused by teenage pregnancy in different countries varies, from 1% to 30% of the annual GDP, with 30% being the figure in Uganda. In the United States, teenage pregnancy costs taxpayers between $9.4 and $28 billion in 2016, due to factors such as foster care and lost tax revenue. A 2014 study estimated that an increase in economic productivity from ending teenage pregnancy in Brazil and India would be worth $3.5 billion and $7.7 billion respectively.

Less than one third of teenage mothers receive any form of child support, vastly increasing the likelihood of turning to the government for assistance. The correlation between earlier childbearing and failure to complete high school reduces career opportunities for many young women. One study found that, in 1988, 60% of teenage mothers were impoverished at the time of giving birth. A 2002 study found that nearly 50% of all adolescent mothers sought social assistance within the first five years of their child&#x27;s life. 

A 1999 study of 100 teenaged mothers in the UK found that only 11% received a salary, while the remaining 89% were unemployed. Most British teenage mothers live in poverty, with nearly half in the bottom fifth of the income distribution.

==Risk factors==

===Culture===
Rates of teenage pregnancies are higher in societies where it is traditional for girls to marry young and where they are encouraged to bear children as soon as they are able. For example, in some sub-Saharan African countries, early pregnancy is often seen as a blessing because it is proof of the young woman&#x27;s fertility. Countries where teenage marriages are common experience higher levels of teenage pregnancies. In the Indian subcontinent, early marriage and pregnancy is more common in traditional rural communities than in cities. Many teenagers are not taught about methods of birth control and how to deal with peers who pressure them into having sex before they are ready. Many pregnant teenagers do not have any cognition of the central facts of sexuality.

Economic incentives also influence the decision to have children. In societies where children are set to work at an early age, it is economically attractive to have many children.

In societies where adolescent marriage is less common, such as many developed countries, young age at first intercourse and lack of use of contraceptive methods (or their inconsistent and/or incorrect use; the use of a method with a high failure rate is also a problem) may be factors in teen pregnancy. Most teenage pregnancies in the developed world appear to be unplanned. Many Western countries have instituted sex education programs, the main objective of which is to reduce unplanned pregnancies and STIs. Countries with low levels of teenagers giving birth accept sexual relationships among teenagers and provide comprehensive and balanced information about sexuality.

Teenage pregnancies are common among Romani people because they marry earlier.

===Other family members===
Teen pregnancy and motherhood can influence younger siblings. One study found that the younger sisters of teen mothers were less likely to emphasize the importance of education and employment and more likely to accept human sexual behavior, parenting, and marriage at younger ages. Younger brothers, too, were found to be more tolerant of non-marital and early births, in addition to being more susceptible to high-risk behaviors. If the younger sisters of teenage parents babysit the children, they have an increased probability of getting pregnant themselves. Once an older daughter has a child, parents often become more accepting as time goes by. A 2011 study in Norway found that the probability of a younger sister having a teenage pregnancy went from 1:5 to 2:5 if the elder sister had a baby as a teenager.

===Sexuality===

In most countries, most males experience sexual intercourse for the first time before their 20th birthday. Males in Western developed countries have sex for the first time sooner than in undeveloped and culturally conservative countries such as sub-Saharan Africa and much of Asia.

In a 2005 Kaiser Family Foundation study of US teenagers, 29% of teens reported feeling pressure to have sex, 33% of sexually active teens reported &quot;being in a relationship where they felt things were moving too fast sexually&quot;, and 24% had &quot;done something sexual they didn&#x27;t really want to do&quot;. Several polls have indicated peer pressure as a factor in encouraging both girls and boys to have sex. The increased sexual activity among adolescents is manifested in increased teenage pregnancies and an increase in sexually transmitted diseases.

===Role of drug and alcohol use===
Inhibition-reducing drugs and alcohol may possibly encourage unintended sexual activity. If so, it is unknown if the drugs themselves directly influence teenagers to engage in riskier behavior, or whether teenagers who engage in drug use are more likely to engage in sex. Correlation does not imply causation. The drugs with the strongest evidence linking them to teenage pregnancy are alcohol, cannabis, &quot;ecstasy&quot; and other substituted amphetamines. The drugs with the least evidence to support a link to early pregnancy are opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and oxycodone, of which a well-known effect is the significant reduction of libido – it appears that teenage opioid users have significantly reduced rates of conception compared to their peers who do not use opioids, and peers who do use alcohol, &quot;ecstasy&quot;, cannabis, and amphetamine.

===Early puberty===
Girls who mature early (precocious puberty) are more likely to engage in sexual intercourse at a younger age, which in turn puts them at greater risk of teenage pregnancy.

===Lack of contraception===
Adolescents may lack knowledge of, or access to, conventional methods of preventing pregnancy, as they may be too embarrassed or frightened to seek such information. Contraception for teenagers presents a huge challenge for the clinician. In 1998, the government of the UK set a target to halve the under-18 pregnancy rate by 2010. The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy (TPS) was established to achieve this. The pregnancy rate in this group, although falling, rose slightly in 2007, to 41.7 per 1,000 women.

Young women often think of contraception either as &#x27;the pill&#x27; or condoms and have little knowledge about other methods. They are heavily influenced by negative, second-hand stories about methods of contraception from their friends and the media. Prejudices are extremely difficult to overcome. Over concern about side-effects, for example weight gain and acne, often affect choice. Missing up to three pills a month is common, and in this age group the figure is likely to be higher. Restarting after the pill-free week, having to hide pills, drug interactions and difficulty getting repeat prescriptions can all lead to method failure.

In the US, according to the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, sexually active adolescent women wishing to avoid pregnancy were less likely than older women to use contraceptives (18% of 15–19-year-olds used no contraceptives, versus 10.7% for women aged 15–44). More than 80% of teen pregnancies are unintended. Over half of unintended pregnancies were to women not using contraceptives, most of the rest are due to inconsistent or incorrect use. 23% of sexually active young women in a 1996 &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine poll admitted to having had unprotected sex with a partner who did not use a condom, while 70% of girls in a 1997 &quot;PARADE&quot; poll claimed it was embarrassing to buy birth control or request information from a doctor.

In 1995, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health surveyed 1,027 students in the US in grades 7–12 to compare the use of contraceptives among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics. 36.2% of Hispanics said they never used contraception during intercourse, compared to 23.3% of Black teens and 17.0% of White teens who did not use contraceptives during intercourse.

In a 2012 US study, over 1,000 females were surveyed to find out factors contributing to not using contraception. Of those surveyed, almost half had been involved in unprotected sex within the previous three months. These women gave three main reasons for not using contraceptives: trouble obtaining birth control (the most frequent reason), lack of intention to have sex, and the misconception that they &quot;could not get pregnant&quot;.
In a 2011 study for the Guttmacher Institute, researchers found that from a comparative perspective, however, teenage pregnancy rates in the US are less nuanced than one might initially assume. &quot;Since timing and levels of sexual activity are quite similar across [Sweden, France, Canada, Great Britain, and the US], the high U.S. rates arise primarily because of less, and possibly less-effective, contraceptive use by sexually active teenagers.&quot; Thus, the cause for the discrepancy between rich nations can be traced largely to contraceptive-based issues.

Among teens in the UK seeking an abortion, a 2007 study found that the rate of contraceptive use was roughly the same for teens as for older women.

In other cases, contraception is used, but proves to be inadequate. Inexperienced adolescents may use condoms incorrectly, forget to take oral contraceptives, or fail to use the contraceptives they had previously chosen. Contraceptive failure rates are higher for teenagers, particularly poor ones, than for older users. Long-acting contraceptives such as intrauterine devices, subcutaneous contraceptive implants, and contraceptive injections (such as Depo-Provera and combined injectable contraceptive), which prevent pregnancy for months or years at a time, are more effective in women who have trouble remembering to take pills or using barrier methods consistently.

According to &quot;Encyclopedia of Women&#x27;s Health&quot;, published in 2004, there has been an increased effort to provide contraception to adolescents via family planning services and school-based health, such as HIV prevention education.

A 2025 study, using Swedish data, found that the introduction of the birth control pill could explain half of the decline in teenage pregnancy following its introduction.

===Sexual abuse===
Studies from South Africa have found that 11–20% of pregnancies in teenagers are a direct result of rape. About 60% of teenage mothers had unwanted sexual experiences preceding their pregnancy. Before age 15, a majority of first-intercourse experiences among females are reported to be non-voluntary. The Guttmacher Institute found that 60% of girls who had sex before age 15 were coerced by males, who on average were six years their senior. In 2003, one in five teenage fathers admitted to forcing girls to have sex with them.

Multiple studies have indicated a strong link between early childhood sexual abuse and subsequent teenage pregnancy in industrialized countries. Up to 70% of women who gave birth in their teens were molested as young girls. By contrast, 25% of women who did not give birth as teens were molested.

In some countries, sexual intercourse between a minor and an adult is not considered consensual under the law because a minor is believed to lack the maturity and competence to make an informed decision to engage in fully consensual sex with an adult. In those countries, sex with a minor is therefore considered statutory rape. In most European countries, by contrast, once an adolescent has reached the age of consent, he or she can legally have sexual relations with adults because it is held that in general (although certain limitations may still apply), reaching the age of consent enables a juvenile to consent to sex with any partner who has also reached that age. Therefore, the definition of statutory rape is limited to sex with a person under the minimum age of consent. What constitutes statutory rape ultimately differs by jurisdiction (see age of consent).

===Dating violence===
Studies have indicated that adolescent girls are often in abusive relationships at the time of their conceiving. They have also reported that knowledge of their pregnancy has often intensified violent and controlling behaviors on part of their boyfriends. Girls under age 18 are twice as likely to be beaten by their child&#x27;s father than women over age 18. A UK study found that 70% of women who gave birth in their teens had experienced adolescent domestic violence. Similar results have been found in studies in the US. A Washington State study found 70% of teenage mothers had been beaten by their boyfriends, 51% had experienced attempts of birth control sabotage within the last year, and 21% experienced school or work sabotage.

In a study of 379 pregnant or parenting teens and 95 teenage girls without children, 62% of girls aged 11–15 and 56% of girls aged 16–19 reported experiencing domestic violence at the hands of their partners. Moreover, 51% of the girls reported experiencing at least one instance where their boyfriend attempted to sabotage their efforts to use birth control.

===Socioeconomic factors===
Teenage pregnancy has been defined predominantly within the research field and among social agencies as a social problem. Poverty is associated with increased rates of teenage pregnancy. Economically poor countries such as Niger and Bangladesh have far more teenage mothers compared with economically rich countries such as Switzerland and Japan.

In the UK in 2001, around half of all pregnancies to those under 18 were concentrated among the 30% most deprived population, with only 14% occurring among the 30% least deprived. For example, in Italy in 2001, the teenage birth rate in the well-off central regions is only 3.3 per 1,000, while in the poorer Mezzogiorno it is 10.0 per 1,000. Similarly, in the US in 2001, sociologist Mike A. Males noted that teenage birth rates closely mapped poverty rates in California:


Teen pregnancy cost the US over $9.1 billion in 2004, including $1.9 billion for health care, $2.3 billion for child welfare, $2.1 billion for incarceration, and $2.9 billion in lower tax revenue.

There is little evidence to support the common belief that teenage mothers become pregnant to get benefits, welfare, and council housing. Most knew little about housing or financial aid before they got pregnant, and what they thought they knew often turned out to be wrong.

===Childhood environment===
Girls exposed to abuse, domestic violence, and family strife in childhood are more likely to become pregnant as teenagers, and the risk of becoming pregnant as a teenager increases with the number of adverse childhood experiences. In a 2004 study, one-third of teenage pregnancies could be prevented by eliminating exposure to abuse, violence, and family strife. The researchers note that &quot;family dysfunction has enduring and unfavorable health consequences for women during the adolescent years, the childbearing years, and beyond.&quot; When the family environment does not include adverse childhood experiences, becoming pregnant as an adolescent does not appear to raise the likelihood of long-term, negative psychosocial consequences. A 2001 study suggested that boys raised by mothers who experienced physical abuse, or who experienced domestic violence directly, were more likely to be involved in a teenage pregnancy.

A 2003 study found that girls whose fathers left the family early in their lives had the highest rates of early sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy. Girls whose fathers left them at a later age had a lower rate of early sexual activity. The lowest rates are found in girls whose fathers were present throughout their childhood. Even when the researchers took into account other factors that could have contributed to early sexual activity and pregnancy, such as behavioral problems and life adversity, early father-absent girls were still about five times more likely in the US and three times more likely in New Zealand to become pregnant as adolescents than were father-present girls.

Low educational expectations have been pinpointed as a risk factor. A girl is more likely to become a teenage parent if her mother or older sister gave birth in her teens. A majority of respondents in a 1988 Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies survey attributed the occurrence of adolescent pregnancy to a breakdown of communication between parents and child and also to inadequate parental supervision.

Foster care youth are more likely than their peers to become pregnant as teenagers. The National Casey Alumni Study, which surveyed foster care alumni from 23 communities across the US, found the birth rate for girls in foster care was more than double the rate of their peers outside the foster care system. A University of Chicago study of youth transitioning out of foster care in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin found that nearly half of the females had been pregnant by age 19. The Utah Department of Human Services found that girls who had left the foster care system between 1999 and 2004 had a birth rate nearly three times the rate for girls in the general population.

=== Media influence ===
A 2006 study found that adolescents who were more exposed to sexuality in the media were more likely to engage in sexual activity themselves. According to &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;teens exposed to the most sexual content on TV are twice as likely as teens watching less of this material to become pregnant before they reach age 20&quot;.

==Prevention==
Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control appear to reduce unplanned teenage pregnancy. It is unclear which type of intervention is most effective.

In the US free access to a long acting form of reversible birth control along with education decreased the rates of teen pregnancies by around 80% and the rate of abortions by more than 75%. Currently there are four federal programs aimed at preventing teenage pregnancy: Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP), Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP), Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education, and Sexual Risk Avoidance Education.

===Education===
The Dutch approach to preventing teenage pregnancy has often been seen as a model by other countries. The curriculum focuses on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills, as well as biological aspects of reproduction. The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach.

In the United States 2016, 39 states and the District of Columbia out of the 50 states required some form of sex education of HIV education. Out of these 39 states and the District of Columbia, 17 states require that the sexual education provided be medically accurate, and 3 states prohibit a program from promoting sexual education in a religious way. These three states include California, Colorado, and Louisiana. 19 of those 39 states stress the importance of only having sex when in a committed marriage. 

From this data, 11 states currently have no requirement for sexual education for any years of schooling, meaning these 11 states may have no sexual education at all. This could mean these states are allowed to teach sexual education in any way they would like, including in medically inaccurate ways. This point is also valid for those 22 states that do not require sexual education to be medically accurate. Comprehensive sexual education has been proven to work to reduce the risk of teen pregnancies. 

Without a nationwide mandate for medically accurate programs, teenagers in the United States are at risk for missing out on valuable information that can protect them. It is unfair to expect teenagers to make educated decisions about sex that can lead to teen pregnancy when they have never been properly educated about the issue. A program developed by experts in public health and sexual education titled &quot;National Sexuality Education Standards,&quot; is a valuable resource that describes what the minimum requirements of sexual education should be across the nation. Giving teenagers the tools that are outlined in that roadmap would have positive effects, as it gives teenagers the resources to make educated decisions. Currently, there is not a national implementation of this program in the United States.

Teen pregnancy can be reduced by sex education, as a 2022 study in 55 US counties showed. The study used federal funded sex education programs as a proxy for sex education, but provided no details about funding levels, the number of students reached, or the amount of time spent on sex education. The reduction of teenage births, not pregnancy, was significant, with a 3% reduction, indicating that an increase in funding, education, or reach could decrease teenage pregnancy even further. Although 3% sounds like a small number, given a teenage girl population of 10 million females aged 15–19 in 2020, and ~190,000 teenage births per year, a 3% reduction would translate to about 6,000 prevented teenage births per year when extrapolated to the whole nation.

===Abstinence only education===
Some schools provide abstinence-only sex education. Evidence does not support the effectiveness of abstinence-only sex education. It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing HIV risk in the developed world, and does not decrease rates of unplanned pregnancy when compared to comprehensive sex education. It does not decrease the sexual activity rates of students, when compared to students who undertake comprehensive sexual education classes.

===Assistance===
Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a non-profit organization operating in the United States and the UK designed to serve the needs of young mothers who may have special needs in their first pregnancy. 
Each mother served is partnered with a registered nurse early in her pregnancy and receives ongoing nurse home visits that continue through her child&#x27;s second birthday. NFP intervention has been associated with improvements in maternal health, child health, and economic security.

===Public policy===
====Canada====
In 2018, Québec&#x27;s Institut national de santé publique (INSPQ) began implementing adjustments to the Protocole de contraception du Québec (Québec Contraception Protocol). The new protocol allows registered nurses to prescribe hormonal birth control, an IUD or emergency birth control to women, as long as they comply with prescribed standards in the Prescription infirmière: Guide explicatif conjoint, and are properly trained in providing contraceptives. In 2020, Québec will offer online training to registered nurses, provided by the Ordre des infirmières et infirmiers du Québec (OIIQ). Nurses that do not have training in the areas of sexually transmitted and blood borne infections may have to take additional online courses provided by the INSPQ.

==== United States ====

In the US, one policy initiative that has been used to increase rates of contraceptive use is Title X. Title X of the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970 () provides family planning services for those who do not qualify for Medicaid by distributing &quot;funding to a network of public, private, and nonprofit entities [to provide] services on a sliding scale based on income.&quot; Studies indicate that, internationally, success in reducing teen pregnancy rates is directly correlated with the kind of access that Title X provides: &quot;What appears crucial to success is that adolescents know where they can go to obtain information and services, can get there easily and are assured of receiving confidential, nonjudgmental care, and that these services and contraceptive supplies are free or cost very little.&quot; In addressing high rates of unplanned teen pregnancies, scholars agree that the problem must be confronted from both the biological and cultural contexts.

In September 2010, the US Department of Health and Human Services approved $155 million in new funding for comprehensive sex education programs designed to prevent teenage pregnancy. The money is being awarded &quot;to states, non-profit organizations, school districts, universities and others. These grants will support the replication of teen pregnancy prevention programs that have been shown to be effective through rigorous research as well as the testing of new, innovative approaches to combating teen pregnancy.&quot; Of the total of $150 million, $55 million is funded by Affordable Care Act through the Personal Responsibility Education Program, which requires states receiving funding to incorporate lessons about both abstinence and contraception.

==== Developing countries ====
In the developing world, programs of reproductive health aimed at teenagers are often small scale and not centrally coordinated, although some countries such as Sri Lanka have a systematic policy framework for teaching about sex within schools. Non-governmental agencies such as the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International provide contraceptive advice for young women worldwide. Laws against child marriage have reduced but not eliminated the practice. Improved female literacy and educational prospects have led to an increase in the age at first birth in areas such as Iran, Indonesia, and the Indian state of Kerala.

===Other===
A team of researchers and educators in California have published a list of &quot;best practices&quot; in the prevention of teen pregnancy, which includes, in addition to the previously mentioned concepts, working to &quot;instill a belief in a successful future&quot;, male involvement in the prevention process, and designing interventions that are culturally relevant.

==Prevalence==

In reporting teenage pregnancy rates, the number of pregnancies per 1,000 females aged 15 to 19. when the pregnancy ends, is generally used.

In 2003, worldwide teenage pregnancy rates ranged from 143 per 1,000 in some sub-Saharan African countries to 2.9 per 1,000 in South Korea. In the US in 2013, 82% of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 were unplanned. Among OECD developed countries in 2001, the US, the UK and New Zealand had the highest level of teenage pregnancy, while Japan and South Korea had the lowest. 

According to the UNFPA, &quot;In every region of the world – including high-income countries – girls who are poor, poorly educated or living in rural areas are at greater risk of becoming pregnant than those who are wealthier, well-educated or urban. This is true on a global level, as well: 95 percent of the world&#x27;s births to adolescents (aged 15–19) take place in developing countries. Every year, some 3 million girls in this age bracket resort to unsafe abortions, risking their lives and health.&quot;

In a 2001 UNICEF survey, in 10 out of 12 developed nations with available data, more than two thirds of young people have had sexual intercourse while still in their teens. In Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Norway, the UK and the US, the proportion is over 80%. In Australia, the UK and the US, approximately 25% of 15-year-olds and 50% of 17-year-olds have had sex. In 2004, approximately 15 million girls under the age of 20 in the world had a child each year. Estimates were that 20–60% of these pregnancies in developing countries are mistimed or unwanted. 

In 2022, UNICEF reported that from 2000 to 2022, &quot;the global adolescent birth rate for the age group 10–14 has declined by over 50 percent, from 3.3 to 1.6 per 1,000 adolescent girls aged 10–14&quot;, and &quot;for the age group 15–19 has declined by over 30 percent, from 65 to 43 births per 1,000 adolescent girls aged 15–19&quot;. UNICEF noted that these declines were &quot;tied to improvements in almost all regional rates&quot;.

In 2004, Save the Children found that, annually, 13 million children are born to women aged under 20 worldwide, with more than 90% in developing countries. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of mortality among women aged 15–19 in such areas.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
The highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world is in sub-Saharan Africa, where women tend to marry at an early age. In 2023, in Western and Central Africa, and Eastern and Southern Africa, over 25% of adolescent girls and young women gave birth before age 18. In these regions, this amounts to an estimated 11 million young women. 

In Niger in 1999, 87% of women surveyed were married and 53% had given birth to a child before the age of 18. A 2018 study found that socio-cultural factors, economic factors, environmental factors, individual factors, and health service-related factors were responsible for the high rates of teenage pregnancy in Sub-Saharan Africa.

===India===
In the Indian subcontinent, early marriage sometimes results in adolescent pregnancy, particularly in rural regions where the rate is much higher than it is in urbanized areas. In 2008, teen pregnancy in India was high, with 62 pregnant teens out of every 1,000 women. India is fast approaching to be the most populous country in the world by 2050 and increasing teenage pregnancy, an important factor for the population rise, is likely to aggravate the problems.

===Asia===
The rates of early marriage and pregnancy in some Asian countries are high. In the 2000s, the rates decreased sharply in Indonesia and Malaysia, although it remains relatively high in Indonesia. In the industrialized Asian nations such as South Korea and Singapore, teenage birth rates remain among the lowest in the world.

===Australia===

In 2015, the birth rate among teenage women in Australia was 11.9 births per 1,000 women. The rate has fallen from 55.5 births per 1,000 women in 1971, probably due to ease of access to effective birth control, rather than any decrease in sexual activity.

===Europe===
The overall trend in Europe since 1970 has been a decreasing total fertility rate, an increase in the age at which women experience their first birth, and a decrease in the number of births among teenagers. Most continental Western European countries have very low teenage birth rates. This is varyingly attributed to good sex education and high levels of contraceptive use (in the case of the Netherlands and Scandinavia), traditional values and social stigmatization (in the case of Spain and Italy) or both (in the case of Switzerland).

On the other hand, the teen birth rate is very high in Bulgaria and Romania. In 2015, Bulgaria had a birth rate of 37 per 1,000 women aged 15–19. Romania had a birth rate of 34 per 1,000 women aged 15–19. The teen birth rate of these two countries is even higher than that of underdeveloped countries like Burundi and Rwanda.
Many of the teen births occur in Roma populations, who have an occurrence of teenage pregnancies well above the local average.

===United Kingdom===

The teen pregnancy rate in England and Wales was 23.3 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17. There were 5,740 pregnancies in girls aged under 18 in the three months to June 2014, data from the Office for National Statistics shows. This compares with 6,279 in the same period in 2013 and 7,083 for the June quarter the year before that. Historically, the UK has had one of the highest teenage pregnancy and abortion rates in Western Europe.

There are no comparable rates for conceptions across Europe, but the under-18 birth rate suggests England is closing the gap. The under-18 birth rate in 2012 in England and Wales was 9.2, compared with an EU average of 6.9. However, the UK birth rate has fallen by almost a third (32.3%) since 2004 compared with a fall of 15.6% in the EU. In 2004, the UK rate was 13.6 births per 1,000 women aged 15–17 compared with an EU average rate of 7.7.

===United States===
In 2001, the teenage birth rate in the US was the highest in the developed world, and the teenage abortion rate is also high. In 2005, 57% of teen pregnancies resulted in a live birth, 27% ended in an induced abortion, and 16% in a fetal loss. The US teenage pregnancy rate was at a high in the 1950s and has decreased since then, although there has been an increase in births out of wedlock. 

The teenage pregnancy rate decreased significantly in the 1990s. This decline was across all racial groups. Teenagers of African-American and Hispanic descent retain a higher rate of teen pregnancy, in comparison to that of European-Americans and Asian-Americans. In 2006, the Guttmacher Institute attributed about 25% of the decline to abstinence and 75% to the effective use of contraceptives. 

In 2006, the US teen birth rate rose for the first time in fourteen years. In 2010, it reached a historic low: 34.3 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19. In 2017, the birth rate for girls ages 15–19 was 18.8 per 1,000. Given a teenage girl population of 10 million females, aged 15–19, in 2020, this would translate to ~190,000 births per year.

In 2009, the Latina teenage pregnancy rate was 75% higher than the national average.

In 2012, the states with the highest teenage birthrates were Mississippi, New Mexico and Arkansas. In 2012, the states with the lowest teenage birthrate were New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Vermont.

===Canada===
Between 1992 and 2002, the Canadian teenage birth rate steadily declined for both younger (15–17) and older (18–19) teens. It dropped from 20.1 per 1,000 women in 2000, to 8.4 in 2020. In Canada, the stability of familial structure significantly influences the risk of teenage pregnancy. In a 2018 study, experiencing one or more episodes of poverty before the age of 13 made young Canadian girls 75% to 90% more vulnerable to teenage pregnancy.

==Teenage fatherhood==
In some cases, the father of the child is the husband of the teenage girl. The conception may occur within wedlock, or the pregnancy itself may precipitate the marriage, the so-called shotgun wedding. In countries such as India, the majority of teenage births occur within marriage.

In the US and Ireland, the majority of teenage mothers are not married to the father of their children. In the UK, half of all teenagers with children are lone parents, 40% are cohabitating as a couple, and 10% are married. Teenage parents are frequently in a romantic relationship at the time of birth, but many adolescent fathers do not stay with the mother and this often disrupts their relationship with the child. US surveys tend to under-report the prevalence of teen fatherhood.

In many cases, &quot;teenage father&quot; may be a misnomer. Studies in the 1990s found that about two-thirds of births to teenage girls in the US are fathered by adult men aged over 20. In 1995, the Guttmacher Institute reported that over 40% of mothers aged 15–17 had sexual partners three to five years older, and almost one in five had partners six or more years older. A 1990 study of births to California teens reported that the younger the mother, the greater the age gap with her male partner. In the UK in 2005, in 72% of jointly registered births to women aged under 20, the father is over 20, with almost 1 in 4 being over 25.

== Intersection of society and culture ==
Teenage pregnancy remains a significant social and cultural issue in many countries around the world. While the rate of teenage pregnancies has declined in recent decades, it continues to be a cause for concern, both from a health perspective and in terms of its impact on the lives of young people.

The causes of teenage pregnancy are complex and multi-faceted, reflecting the interplay between individual behavior, societal norms and cultural attitudes. In many cultures, there is a lack of comprehensive sexual education, which contributes to a lack of understanding about contraception and sexually transmitted infections. There is also a cultural stigma attached to discussing sexual health and relationships, which makes it difficult for young people to access the information and support they need.

Poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and limited opportunities for education and employment can also contribute to the high rate of teenage pregnancy. These factors can make it difficult for young people to make informed choices about their sexual health and can limit their ability to access contraception and other forms of protection.

The effects of some of the teenage they get pregnancy can be far-reaching and long-lasting. Pregnant teenagers are at increased risk of health problems, including complications during pregnancy and childbirth, and are more likely to experience poverty and limited opportunities later in life. Their children are also more likely to experience health and developmental problems, and to grow up in poverty.

Despite these challenges, there are many programs and initiatives aimed at reducing the rate of teenage pregnancy and supporting young people who become pregnant. These efforts include comprehensive sex education programs, access to contraception and family planning services, and support for young mothers.

In conclusion, teenage pregnancy is a complex issue that reflects the interplay between individual behavior, societal norms and cultural attitudes. Addressing this issue requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, access to healthcare, and support for young people. By working together, we can help to reduce the rate of teenage pregnancy and improve the lives of young people and their families.

===Politics===
Some politicians condemn pregnancy in unmarried teenagers as a drain on taxpayers, if the mothers and children receive welfare payments and social housing from the government.

===Media===
In 1989, singer Terry Tate, a former teacher and graduate from Seton Hall University used his knowledge of issues concerning young students at his school which included teenage pregnancy to compose the song, &quot;Babies Having Babies&quot;. Radio stations became involved in trying to get the message across. It ended up being a national hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Cash Box&quot; charts in 1989.

<text>Kenneth Thomas Jones (born 16 September 1948) is an English drummer best known for his work in the groups Small Faces, Faces and the Who. Jones was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Small Faces/Faces.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kenneth Thomas Jones was born on 16 September 1948 in Whitechapel, London, England.

===Small Faces to Faces===
Having previously been in a band with Ronnie Lane, Jones was one of the founding members of the English rock group Small Faces. Active from 1965 to 1969, Small Faces were part of the Mod trend of the 1960s. Their hits included &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, &quot;Sha-La-La-La-Lee&quot;, &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; and &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;.

In 2007, Small Faces were honoured by Westminster Council with a commemorative plaque placed at what was Don Arden&#x27;s offices in Carnaby Street, the band&#x27;s &quot;spiritual home&quot;. Jones himself unveiled the plaque. In a BBC interview, Jones said: &quot;To honour the Small Faces after all these years is a terrific achievement. I only wish that Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane and Don Arden were here to enjoy this moment with me&quot;. Since the death of Jimmy Winston in September 2020, Jones and Rick Wills are the sole surviving members of the Small Faces.

In 2004 &quot;The Observer&quot; listed the Small Faces&#x27; 1968 release &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; one of the &quot;top British albums of all time&quot;.

After the departure of lead singer/guitarist Steve Marriott in 1969, the group recruited singer Rod Stewart and guitarist Ronnie Wood to replace Marriott. Both were formerly with the Jeff Beck Group. The band changed its name to Faces, as the original name was associated with the small stature of its members, and Stewart and Wood did not fit the description. Jones remained with the band until its dissolution in late 1975, recording four studio albums and a live album with them.

===The Who===

In November 1978, Jones was invited by guitarist Pete Townshend and manager Bill Curbishley to join The Who, replacing their original drummer Keith Moon, who had died of a drug overdose in September. He was invited, in part, because the band had been friendly with him from his days with the Small Faces (he and Moon were friends and were together on the last night of Moon&#x27;s life in 1978, as part of the viewing party put together by Paul McCartney for &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;), and because he had played with Townshend, Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle on the &quot;Tommy&quot; soundtrack. He played on the albums &quot;Face Dances&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; and also played on the soundtrack for Daltrey&#x27;s film &quot;McVicar&quot;, as well as on the band&#x27;s tours from 1979 to 1982. Jones played with the band at Live Aid in 1985.

Jones&#x27; final appearance as a regular member of the Who was when the group received a lifetime achievement award at the 1988 British Phonographic Industry awards ceremony. He was frequently at odds with Daltrey, who felt that Jones&#x27; drumming style was not right for the band (Jones&#x27;s playing was usually straighter and less frenetic than Moon&#x27;s), but Daltrey has denied having anything personal against Jones or his drumming.

Jones was replaced by Simon Phillips for the Who&#x27;s 1989 reunion tour. In an April 2011 special edition of &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine, Townshend said that Jones was a good choice for the band.

Jones reunited with The Who on 14 June 2014 at the Rock n Horsepower benefit concert held at his Hurtwood Polo Club. The band performed for an event set up by Jones to benefit Prostate Cancer UK, an organization that promotes awareness of the disease that Jones has. It was the first time that he had appeared onstage with Townshend and Daltrey since 1988. Sharing the bill were contemporaries such as Jeff Beck, Procol Harum and Mike Rutherford.

===The Law===
Jones formed partnerships with former Free, Bad Company, and The Firm singer Paul Rodgers in the early 1990s, forming a band called The Law.

===The Jones Gang===
In 2001, Jones formed a new band; over several months, the line-up solidified to include Rick Wills and Robert Hart. In 2005, The Jones Gang released their debut album, &quot;Any Day Now&quot;.

===Guest appearances===
Jones has been featured on recordings as a guest drummer on many recording sessions, including appearances on albums by Rod Stewart, The Rolling Stones, Ronnie Wood, Roger Daltrey, Andy Fairweather-Low, Joan Armatrading, Keith Moon, Marsha Hunt, Mike Batt, Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, David Essex, John Lodge and Wings. He was also on a &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance with Status Quo, performing their 1986 hit single, &quot;Red Sky&quot;.

===Outside music===
Outside of music, Jones is a fan of polo. He has become an accomplished polo player and is the owner of Hurtwood Park Polo Club, in Ewhurst, Surrey.

On behalf of Small Faces and in memory of his late colleagues Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, Jones established a children&#x27;s charity, the Small Faces Charitable Trust, in 1999.

Jones is a supporter of the Conservative Party, and recorded a song called &quot;Mr Brown&quot; written by Robert Hart, criticising the tax policies of the then Chancellor of Exchequer Gordon Brown. He has also performed in support of the Countryside Alliance.

Jones&#x27; memoir, &quot;Let the Good Times Roll: My Life in Small Faces, Faces, and The Who&quot;, was released in September 2018 ().

==Personal life==
Jones has six children. He is married to retired model Jayne Andrew, mother of four of his children. He was previously married to singer Jan Osborne, sister of Gary Osborne. In September 2013 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, for which he was treated with brachytherapy.

Jones stated that he &quot;virtually taught&quot; Zak Starkey, son of Ringo Starr, how to play drums. Jones was close friends with Starkey&#x27;s parents. After replacing Moon in The Who, Jones gave Starkey one of Moon&#x27;s old drum kits. In 1996, Starkey became The Who&#x27;s touring drummer.

<text>Zak Richard Starkey (born 13 September 1965) is an English rock drummer who has performed and recorded with the Who since 1996. He is also the third drummer to have appeared with Oasis. Other musicians and bands he has worked with include Johnny Marr, the Icicle Works, the Lightning Seeds, and the Semantics. He is the son of the Beatles&#x27; drummer Ringo Starr and Maureen Starkey.

==Early life==
Zak Richard Starkey was born on 13 September 1965, at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital in Hammersmith, London, to the Beatles&#x27; drummer Ringo Starr (Richard Starkey) and Maureen Starkey, Starr&#x27;s first wife. He grew up at Sunny Heights at St George&#x27;s Hill in Surrey and Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill, Berkshire, and attended Highgate School in London until 1981.

At the age of eight, Starkey was given a drum kit by the Who&#x27;s drummer, Keith Moon. Moon (known to young Zak as &quot;Uncle Keith&quot;) was one of his father&#x27;s closest friends and Starkey&#x27;s godfather. Although they never sat together at a drum kit, Moon discussed drumming with him as a boy. The drum kit was later sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for £12,000.

Starkey subsequently began teaching himself to play the drums. His father gave him only one lesson, but he discouraged his growing interest because of the desire not to see him in the same business. Although Starr has praised his son&#x27;s abilities, he had always regarded him as a future lawyer or doctor. Starr&#x27;s close friend, Kenney Jones, drummer for Faces and Moon&#x27;s replacement in the Who, stated that he &quot;virtually taught&quot; the young Starkey to play the drums. By the age of twelve, Starkey was performing in pubs as a member of the garage band the Next. After Moon&#x27;s death, Jones gifted the teenage Starkey a white drum kit formerly owned by Moon, which had been kept in storage by the Who.

==Career==

===Spencer Davis, Eddie Hardin, John Entwistle and the Icicle Works===
In the early 1980s, Starkey appeared with a re-formed Spencer Davis Group. He briefly joined the Semantics, replacing founding drummer Jody Spence, during the recording process for their album &quot;Powerbill&quot;, which ended up being released only in Japan in 1996 (after the group had disbanded). He joined the band when they moved from Nashville to Los Angeles and played in some shows and some recording sessions, but the band broke up less than a year after he joined.

In 1985, Starkey played on John Entwistle&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Rock&quot; (released in 1996). Starkey replaced Chris Sharrock as the drummer in the Icicle Works in 1988, leaving the band after a brief tenure and appearing on only one recording. Founder member Ian McNabb issued a B-side after Starkey&#x27;s departure from the band. The song features Starkey on drums and, as it includes band personnel from the time, is presumed to date from his tenure with the group. Starkey also plays on the 1989 album &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, a solo work released by Iron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith.

===Ringo Starr and the All-Starr Band===
In 1985, Starkey joined his father on &quot;Sun City&quot; by Artists United Against Apartheid, and during 1992 and 1995, he toured with Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band, having previously guested on the band&#x27;s 1989 tour. Starkey performed at Ringo Starr&#x27;s 70th birthday party on 7 July 2010 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. He joined his father and guest stars Yoko Ono, Nils Lofgren, Steven Van Zandt and Jeff Lynne for &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; and &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;.

===1996–present: the Who ===
In 1994, he joined John Entwistle and Roger Daltrey of the Who on a tour entitled &quot;Daltrey Sings Townshend&quot;, which had developed from a two-night performance at Carnegie Hall to celebrate Daltrey&#x27;s fiftieth birthday. In late 1995, he joined the band Face. In the spring of 1996, he left the band to work with the Who on their &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; tour. He received good reviews in this role and was praised by the music press for his strong drumming presence, without trying to emulate the band&#x27;s original drummer Keith Moon. Both Townshend and Daltrey stated that Starkey was the best match for the band since the death of Keith Moon.
On 20 October 2001, he performed with the Who at the Concert for New York City at Madison Square Garden. This was heralded as the Who&#x27;s &quot;comeback&quot; performance and they stole the show. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called their performance &quot;one of the 50 moments that changed rock and roll&quot;. It was also one of John Entwistle&#x27;s final appearances with the band.
On 7 February 2010, Starkey appeared with the Who during the half-time show of Super Bowl XLIV at the Sun Life Stadium, Miami, Florida.

Starkey was not available to record for most of the Who&#x27;s 2006 album&quot; Endless Wire&quot;, as he had been on the road with Oasis and only had time to play on one track. However, he did join the Who for The Who Tour 2006-2007 in support of the album, during which they headlined at Glastonbury Festival in 2007. The tour finished at the Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, Finland on 9 July 2007. Pete Townshend&#x27;s official website stated that Starkey was afterwards invited to become a full member of the Who, stating: &quot;Some of you may have noticed in one of my recent diary postings that I welcomed Zak into the Who as a permanent member. This is something he doesn&#x27;t feel he needs or wants. Let&#x27;s just say that the door is always open to this amazing musician and whenever we can, we will always try to make it possible for Zak to work with the Who in the future.&quot; On 12 July 2008, Starkey played the drums for the Who at the 3rd annual VH1 Rock Honors, which celebrated the band&#x27;s long career.
On 30 March 2010, he played with the band during their performance of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. 
On 12 August 2012, he played with the Who at the finale of the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and later that year, on 12 December, he joined them at 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief. Starkey also joined the Who on their 2012–13 Quadrophenia and More tour, but he had to back out in February 2013 when he developed tendonitis but he re-joined the Who in September 2014 for their Who Hits 50 tour of UK and Europe and North America. in July 2015 and other shows during this year as part of The Who Hits 50! tour, which had started in 2014. This tour went on to include the Who at Desert Trip concert at Coachella Festival in California on 28 June 2015. Starkey also appeared with the Who when they performed as the headline act at the Glastonbury Festival. During this time, Starkey also played shows with Mick Jones of the Clash and formed the Silver Machine with Bobby Gillespie, Andrew Innes, Glen Matlock and Little Barrie.

In September 2016, Starkey was interviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about the new covers album he was working on with Sharna Liguz, compiled with songs that had influenced them. They recorded these with the original members from each of the relevant bands. Funding for the album&#x27;s ten tracks was raised by a crowdfunding campaign through the Pledgemusic site. Under the name SSHH, Starkey and Liguz also recorded other tracks.

===1996–2003: Johnny Marr &amp; the Healers===
In 2000, Starkey was a founding member of Johnny Marr &amp; the Healers, although their first album, &quot;Boomslang&quot;, would not be released for another three years after which the band did a world tour in 2003. On 14 April 2001, he featured in both of the backing bands for the &quot;Steve Marriott Tribute Concert&quot;, in which he appeared along with Rick Wills, Rabbit Bundrick, Bobby Tench, Noel Gallagher and Paul Weller.

===2004–2009: Oasis===
During 2004, Starkey joined the Britpop band Oasis and was also featured on two tracks included on the Who&#x27;s biographical album, &quot;The Who: Then and Now&quot;. In May 2005, Noel Gallagher told the BBC that Starkey had participated in the recording sessions for &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot;. Starkey had recorded all but one track of these sessions which were originally called &quot;Mucky Fingers&quot; and were also for an official promotional video for the album. After the completion of these sessions Starkey stated: &quot;It was amazing. They&#x27;re all singers, they&#x27;re all guitar players, they&#x27;re all songwriters, they&#x27;re all producers and they&#x27;re all drummers.&quot;
He travelled as a sideman on the year-long Oasis tour that followed and appeared in promotional videos for the associated singles. Despite this, he was not an official member of the band and rarely appeared with them in promotions. In April 2005, Noel Gallagher confirmed that he had been invited to be their official drummer and added that this could not materialize before his current working engagements with the Who were completed in mid-2007. Their former drummer also had to be &quot;paid out&quot; contractually out of the band. On 14 February 2007, Starkey appeared with Oasis when they received the BRIT Award for outstanding contribution to music.

His participation in the making of the Oasis album, &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot;, was confirmed on 11 December 2007, when the official Oasis website published a picture of him with the other band members. However, it was announced that he would not perform on the Dig Out Your Soul Tour after falling out with Noel Gallagher subsequently departing in 2008 and was replaced by Chris Sharrock. A year later he recalled that playing with them was &quot;massive&quot; and called the band &quot;some of the smartest musicians I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;.

===Penguins Rising===
In 2008, Starkey formed the band Penguins Rising which had previously been called Penguin, along with his partner Sharna Liguz. The band&#x27;s original lineup also included his daughter Tatia. Penguins Rising went on to support Kasabian and Beady Eye on their respective tours. They released an album under the moniker of Pengu!ns, entitled &quot;Hatemale&quot;, in 2011. Sshh signed to BMG as a solo artist in 2018, and the duo toured Australia opening for Primal Scream and then Liam Gallagher in support of the Sshh single &quot;Rising Tide&quot;.

===2016–present: Jamaica and reggae albums===
Starkey went on to build a studio in Ocho Rios and formed the in-house recording group with Sshh Liguz, Sly &amp; Robbie, Tony Chin, Cyril Neville and Robbie Lyn. In 2016, he launched the record label Trojan Jamaica based on the island, co-funded by BMG Rights Management. The Trojan name was licensed for use from the Trojan Records label. The label was formed with a mandate to reflect music from Jamaica along with soul and blues from America. Recording on Trojan Jamaica and with the roles of co-producer and guitarist he is credited on the albums &#x27;Red Gold Green &amp; Blue&#x27;, &#x27;Red Gold Green &amp; Blue RMXZ&#x27; both released in 2019. In 2020, &quot;RGGB RMXZ&quot; was released, while &quot;Got To Be Tough&quot; by Toots and the Maytals followed the same year. This won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album that year. Additionally, the album &quot;Solid Gold&quot; was released by U-Roy, featuring Ziggy Marley, Santigold, Shaggy, Big Youth, Mick Jones of the Clash (Starkey has previously gigged with Jones), Richie Spice, Tarrus Riley, Jesse Royal, and Rygin King. At this time, Starkey and his partner&#x27;s band Sshh appeared at the invitation of the Peter Tosh Museum in Kingston, Jamaica, performing their version of &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; (featuring Soul Syndicate and Eddie Vedder).

<text>The Decline is an EP by NOFX. It was released on November 23, 1999. The CD version consisted of only the 18-minute title track, but the vinyl included a different version of &quot;Clams Have Feelings Too&quot; (from &quot;Pump Up the Valuum&quot;) on the B-side. &quot;The Decline&quot; is largely a satire of American politics and law, with an overwhelming concern for blind behaviors of the masses, such as complacency, indifference, gun violence, drug-use, and conformity, as well as destruction of constitutional rights, and condemnation of the religious right. Although the lyrics are somewhat disjointed, they all refer back to the unifying theme of the &quot;decline&quot; of America. The trombone is played by Lars Nylander of Skankin&#x27; Pickle.

According to the band,

The first 155 copies were pressed on clear vinyl, a version which is no longer available.

The first 1 min and 20 seconds of a live version of &quot;The Decline&quot; is played as an encore after &quot;Stickin&#x27; In My Eye&quot; on &quot;They&#x27;ve Actually Gotten Worse Live!&quot; (2007) before being faded out. A DVD featuring a live performance of The Decline was released on September 12, 2012.

In 2016, an orchestral arrangement was released as part of the &quot;Mild in the Streets: Fat Music Unplugged&quot; compilation album, recorded by Baz and His Orchestra. Additionally, a video of the performance has been released. In 2019, NOFX and Baz&#x27;s Orchestra recorded a live version while performing at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, and it was subsequently published in 2020. The Decline was the final song performed by NOFX in the band&#x27;s final ever performance held on October 6, 2024 in San Pedro, Los Angeles.

<doc id="228839" wikidata="Q221221" url="?curid=228839" title="Blazar">
<text>A blazar is an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a relativistic jet (a jet composed of ionized matter traveling at nearly the speed of light) directed very nearly towards an observer. Relativistic beaming of electromagnetic radiation from the jet makes blazars appear much brighter than they would be if the jet were pointed in a direction away from Earth. Blazars are powerful sources of emission across the electromagnetic spectrum and are observed to be sources of high-energy gamma ray photons. Blazars are highly variable sources, often undergoing rapid and dramatic fluctuations in brightness on short timescales (hours to days). Some blazar jets appear to exhibit superluminal motion, another consequence of material in the jet traveling toward the observer at nearly the speed of light.

The blazar category includes BL Lac objects and optically violently variable (OVV) quasars. The generally accepted theory is that BL Lac objects are intrinsically low-power radio galaxies while OVV quasars are intrinsically powerful radio-loud quasars. The name &quot;blazar&quot; was coined in 1978 by astronomer Edward Spiegel to denote the combination of these two classes.

In visible-wavelength images, most blazars appear compact and pointlike, but high-resolution images reveal that they are located at the centers of elliptical galaxies.

Blazars are important topics of research in astronomy and high-energy astrophysics. Blazar research includes investigation of the properties of accretion disks and jets, the central supermassive black holes and surrounding host galaxies, and the emission of high-energy photons, cosmic rays, and neutrinos.

In July 2018, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory team traced a neutrino that hit its Antarctica-based detector in September 2017 to its point of origin in a blazar 3.7 billion light-years away. This was the first time that a neutrino detector was used to locate an object in space.

==Structure==

Blazars, like all active galactic nuclei (AGN), are thought to be powered by material falling into a supermassive black hole in the core of the host galaxy. Gas, dust and the occasional star are captured and spiral into this central black hole, creating a hot accretion disk which generates enormous amounts of energy in the form of photons, electrons, positrons and other elementary particles. This region is relatively small, approximately 10−3 parsecs in size.

There is also a larger opaque toroid extending several parsecs from the black hole, containing a hot gas with embedded regions of higher density. These &quot;clouds&quot; can absorb and re-emit energy from regions closer to the black hole. On Earth, the clouds are detected as emission lines in the blazar spectrum.

Perpendicular to the accretion disk, a pair of relativistic jets carries highly energetic plasma away from the AGN. The jet is collimated by a combination of intense magnetic fields and powerful winds from the accretion disk and toroid. Inside the jet, high energy photons and particles interact with each other and the strong magnetic field. These relativistic jets can extend as far as many tens of kiloparsecs from the central black hole.

All of these regions can produce a variety of observed energy, mostly in the form of a nonthermal spectrum ranging from very low-frequency radio to extremely energetic gamma rays, with a high polarization (typically a few percent) at some frequencies. The nonthermal spectrum consists of synchrotron radiation in the radio to X-ray range, and inverse Compton emission in the X-ray to gamma-ray region. A thermal spectrum peaking in the ultraviolet region and faint optical emission lines are also present in OVV quasars, but faint or non-existent in BL Lac objects.

==Relativistic beaming==

The observed emission from a blazar is greatly enhanced by relativistic effects in the jet, a process called relativistic beaming. The bulk speed of the plasma that constitutes the jet can be in the range of 95%–99% of the speed of light, although individual particles move at higher speeds in various directions.

The relationship between the luminosity emitted in the rest frame of the jet and the luminosity observed from Earth depends on the characteristics of the jet. These include whether the luminosity arises from a shock front or a series of brighter blobs in the jet, as well as details of the magnetic fields within the jet and their interaction with the moving particles.

A simple model of beaming illustrates the basic relativistic effects connecting the luminosity in the rest frame of the jet, &quot;S&quot;e, and the luminosity observed on Earth, &quot;S&quot;o: &quot;S&quot;o is proportional to &quot;S&quot;e × &quot;D&quot;2, where &quot;D is&quot; the doppler factor.

When considered in much more detail, three relativistic effects are involved:

* Relativistic aberration contributes a factor of &quot;D&quot;2. Aberration is a consequence of special relativity where directions which appear isotropic in the rest frame (in this case, the jet) appear pushed towards the direction of motion in the observer&#x27;s frame (in this case, Earth).
* Time dilation contributes a factor of &quot;D&quot;+1. This effect speeds up the apparent release of energy. If the jet emits a burst of energy every minute in its own rest frame, this release would be observed on Earth as much more frequent, perhaps every ten seconds.
* Windowing can contribute a factor of &quot;D&quot;−1 and then works to decrease boosting. This happens for a steady flow because there are then &quot;D&quot; fewer elements of fluid within the observed window, as each element has been expanded by factor &quot;D&quot;. However, for a freely propagating blob of material, the radiation is boosted by the full &quot;D&quot;+3.

===Example===
Consider a jet with an angle to the line of sight θ = 5° and a speed of 99.9% of the speed of light. The luminosity observed from Earth is 70 times greater than the emitted luminosity. However, if θ is at the minimum value of 0° the jet will appear 600 times brighter from Earth.

===Beaming away===
Relativistic beaming also has another critical consequence. The jet which is not approaching Earth will appear dimmer because of the same relativistic effects. Therefore, two intrinsically identical jets will appear significantly asymmetric. In the example given above any jet where θ &gt; 35° will be observed on Earth as less luminous than it would be from the rest frame of the jet.

A further consequence is that a population of intrinsically identical AGN scattered in space with random jet orientations will look like a very inhomogeneous population on Earth. The few objects where θ is small will have one very bright jet, while the rest will apparently have considerably weaker jets. Those where θ varies from 90° will appear to have asymmetric jets.

This is the essence behind the connection between blazars and radio galaxies. AGN which have jets oriented close to the line of sight with Earth can appear extremely different from other AGN even if they are intrinsically identical.

==Discovery==
Many of the brighter blazars were first identified, not as powerful distant galaxies, but as irregular variable stars in our own galaxy. These blazars, like genuine irregular variable stars, changed in brightness on periods of days or years, but with no pattern.

The early development of radio astronomy had shown that there are many bright radio sources in the sky. By the end of the 1950s, the resolution of radio telescopes was sufficient to identify specific radio sources with optical counterparts, leading to the discovery of quasars. Blazars were highly represented among these early quasars, and the first redshift was found for 3C 273, a highly variable quasar which is also a blazar.

In 1968, a similar connection was made between the &quot;variable star&quot; BL Lacertae and a powerful radio source VRO 42.22.01. BL Lacertae shows many of the characteristics of quasars, but the optical spectrum was devoid of the spectral lines used to determine redshift. Faint indications of an underlying galaxy—proof that BL Lacertae was not a star—were found in 1974.

The extragalactic nature of BL Lacertae was not a surprise. In 1972 a few variable optical and radio sources were grouped together and proposed as a new class of galaxy: BL Lacertae-type objects. This terminology was soon shortened to &quot;BL Lacertae object&quot;, &quot;BL Lac object&quot; or simply &quot;BL Lac&quot;. (The latter term can also mean the original individual blazar and not the entire class.)

, a few hundred BL Lac objects were known. One of the closest blazars is 2.5 billion light years away.

==Current view==
Blazars are thought to be active galactic nuclei, with relativistic jets oriented close to the line of sight with the observer.

The special jet orientation explains the general peculiar characteristics: high observed luminosity, very rapid variation, high polarization (compared to non-blazar quasars), and the apparent superluminal motions detected along the first few parsecs of the jets in most blazars.

A Unified Scheme or Unified Model has become generally accepted, where highly variable quasars are related to intrinsically powerful radio galaxies, and BL Lac objects are related to intrinsically weak radio galaxies. The distinction between these two connected populations explains the difference in emission line properties in blazars.

Other explanations for the relativistic jet/unified scheme approach which have been proposed include gravitational microlensing and coherent emission from the relativistic jet. Neither of these explains the overall properties of blazars. For example, microlensing is achromatic. That is, all parts of a spectrum would rise and fall together. This is not observed in blazars. However, it is possible that these processes, as well as more complex plasma physics, can account for specific observations or some details.

Examples of blazars include 3C 454.3, 3C 273, BL Lacertae, PKS 2155-304, Markarian 421, Markarian 501, 4C +71.07, PKS 0537-286 (QSO 0537-286) and S5 0014+81. Markarian 501 and S5 0014+81 are also called &quot;TeV Blazars&quot; for their high energy (teraelectron-volt range) gamma-ray emission.

In July 2018, a blazar called TXS 0506+056 was identified as source of high-energy neutrinos by the IceCube project.

<text>In biology, the extracellular matrix (ECM), also called intercellular matrix (ICM), is a network consisting of extracellular macromolecules and minerals, such as collagen, enzymes, glycoproteins and hydroxyapatite that provide structural and biochemical support to surrounding cells. Because multicellularity evolved independently in different multicellular lineages, the composition of ECM varies between multicellular structures; however, cell adhesion, cell-to-cell communication and differentiation are common functions of the ECM.

The animal extracellular matrix includes the interstitial matrix and the basement membrane. Interstitial matrix is present between various animal cells (i.e., in the intercellular spaces). Gels of polysaccharides and fibrous proteins fill the interstitial space and act as a compression buffer against the stress placed on the ECM. Basement membranes are sheet-like depositions of ECM on which various epithelial cells rest. Each type of connective tissue in animals has a type of ECM: collagen fibers and bone mineral comprise the ECM of bone tissue; reticular fibers and ground substance comprise the ECM of loose connective tissue; and blood plasma is the ECM of blood.

The plant ECM includes cell wall components, like cellulose, in addition to more complex signaling molecules. Some single-celled organisms adopt multicellular biofilms in which the cells are embedded in an ECM composed primarily of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS).

== Structure ==

Components of the ECM are produced intracellularly by resident cells and secreted into the ECM via exocytosis. Once secreted, they then aggregate with the existing matrix. The ECM is composed of an interlocking mesh of fibrous proteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

===Proteoglycans===
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are carbohydrate polymers and mostly attached to extracellular matrix proteins to form proteoglycans (hyaluronic acid is a notable exception; see below). Proteoglycans have a net negative charge that attracts positively charged sodium ions (Na+), which attracts water molecules via osmosis, keeping the ECM and resident cells hydrated. Proteoglycans may also help to trap and store growth factors within the ECM.

Described below are the different types of proteoglycan found within the extracellular matrix.

====Heparan sulfate====
Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear polysaccharide found in all animal tissues. It occurs as a proteoglycan (PG) in which two or three HS chains are attached in close proximity to cell surface or ECM proteins. It is in this form that HS binds to a variety of protein ligands and regulates a wide variety of biological activities, including developmental processes, angiogenesis, blood coagulation, and tumour metastasis.

In the extracellular matrix, especially basement membranes, the multi-domain proteins perlecan, agrin, and collagen XVIII are the main proteins to which heparan sulfate is attached.

====Chondroitin sulfate====
Chondroitin sulfates contribute to the tensile strength of cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and walls of the aorta. They have also been known to affect neuroplasticity.

====Keratan sulfate====
Keratan sulfates have a variable sulfate content and, unlike many other GAGs, do not contain uronic acid. They are present in the cornea, cartilage, bones, and the horns of animals.

===Non-proteoglycan polysaccharide===
====Hyaluronic acid====
Hyaluronic acid (or &quot;hyaluronan&quot;) is a polysaccharide consisting of alternating residues of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, and unlike other GAGs, is not found as a proteoglycan. Hyaluronic acid in the extracellular space confers upon tissues the ability to resist compression by providing a counteracting turgor (swelling) force by absorbing significant amounts of water. Hyaluronic acid is thus found in abundance in the ECM of load-bearing joints. It is also a chief component of the interstitial gel. Hyaluronic acid is found on the inner surface of the cell membrane and is translocated out of the cell during biosynthesis.

Hyaluronic acid acts as an environmental cue that regulates cell behavior during embryonic development, healing processes, inflammation, and tumor development. It interacts with a specific transmembrane receptor, CD44.

===Proteins===
====Collagen====
Collagen is the most abundant protein in the ECM, and is the most abundant protein in the human body. It accounts for 90% of bone matrix protein content. Collagens are present in the ECM as fibrillar proteins and give structural support to resident cells. Collagen is exocytosed in precursor form (procollagen), which is then cleaved by procollagen proteases to allow extracellular assembly. Disorders such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and epidermolysis bullosa are linked with genetic defects in collagen-encoding genes. The collagen can be divided into several families according to the types of structure they form:
# Fibrillar (Type I, II, III, V, XI)
# Facit (Type IX, XII, XIV)
# Short chain (Type VIII, X)
# Basement membrane (Type IV)
# Other (Type VI, VII, XIII)

====Elastin====
Elastins, in contrast to collagens, give elasticity to tissues, allowing them to stretch when needed and then return to their original state. This is useful in blood vessels, the lungs, in skin, and the ligamentum nuchae, and these tissues contain high amounts of elastins. Elastins are synthesized by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Elastins are highly insoluble, and tropoelastins are secreted inside a chaperone molecule, which releases the precursor molecule upon contact with a fiber of mature elastin. Tropoelastins are then deaminated to become incorporated into the elastin strand. Disorders such as cutis laxa and Williams syndrome are associated with deficient or absent elastin fibers in the ECM.

===Extracellular vesicles===
In 2016, Huleihel et al., reported the presence of DNA, RNA, and Matrix-bound nanovesicles (MBVs) within ECM bioscaffolds. MBVs shape and size were found to be consistent with previously described exosomes. MBVs cargo includes different protein molecules, lipids, DNA, fragments, and miRNAs. Similar to ECM bioscaffolds, MBVs can modify the activation state of macrophages and alter different cellular properties such as; proliferation, migration and cell cycle. MBVs are now believed to be an integral and functional key component of ECM bioscaffolds.

==Cell adhesion proteins==
=== Fibronectin ===
Fibronectins are glycoproteins that connect cells with collagen fibers in the ECM, allowing cells to move through the ECM. Fibronectins bind collagen and cell-surface integrins, causing a reorganization of the cell&#x27;s cytoskeleton to facilitate cell movement. Fibronectins are secreted by cells in an unfolded, inactive form. Binding to integrins unfolds fibronectin molecules, allowing them to form dimers so that they can function properly. Fibronectins also help at the site of tissue injury by binding to platelets during blood clotting and facilitating cell movement to the affected area during wound healing.

=== Laminin ===
Laminins are proteins found in the basal laminae of virtually all animals. Rather than forming collagen-like fibers, laminins form networks of web-like structures that resist tensile forces in the basal lamina. They also assist in cell adhesion. Laminins bind other ECM components such as collagens and nidogens.

==Development==
There are many cell types that contribute to the development of the various types of extracellular matrix found in the plethora of tissue types. The local components of ECM determine the properties of the connective tissue.

Fibroblasts are the most common cell type in connective tissue ECM, in which they synthesize, maintain, and provide a structural framework; fibroblasts secrete the precursor components of the ECM, including the ground substance. Chondrocytes are found in cartilage and produce the cartilaginous matrix. Osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation.

==Physiology==
===Stiffness and elasticity===
The ECM can exist in varying degrees of stiffness and elasticity, from soft brain tissues to hard bone tissues. The elasticity of the ECM can differ by several orders of magnitude. This property is primarily dependent on collagen and elastin concentrations, and it has recently been shown to play an influential role in regulating numerous cell functions.

Cells can sense the mechanical properties of their environment by applying forces and measuring the resulting backlash. This plays an important role because it helps regulate many important cellular processes including cellular contraction, cell migration, cell proliferation, differentiation and cell death (apoptosis).
Inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II blocks most of these effects, indicating that they are indeed tied to sensing the mechanical properties of the ECM, which has become a new focus in research during the past decade.

====Effect on gene expression====
Differing mechanical properties in ECM exert effects on both cell behaviour and gene expression. Although the mechanism by which this is done has not been thoroughly explained, adhesion complexes and the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, whose contractile forces are transmitted through transcellular structures are thought to play key roles in the yet to be discovered molecular pathways.

====Effect on differentiation====
ECM elasticity can direct cellular differentiation, the process by which a cell changes from one cell type to another. In particular, naive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to specify lineage and commit to phenotypes with extreme sensitivity to tissue-level elasticity. MSCs placed on soft matrices that mimic the brain differentiate into neuron-like cells, showing similar shape, RNAi profiles, cytoskeletal markers, and transcription factor levels. Similarly stiffer matrices that mimic muscle are myogenic, and matrices with stiffnesses that mimic collagenous bone are osteogenic.

====Durotaxis====

Stiffness and elasticity also guide cell migration, this process is called durotaxis. The term was coined by Lo CM and colleagues when they discovered the tendency of single cells to migrate up rigidity gradients (towards more stiff substrates) and has been extensively studied since. The molecular mechanisms behind durotaxis are thought to exist primarily in the focal adhesion, a large protein complex that acts as the primary site of contact between the cell and the ECM. This complex contains many proteins that are essential to durotaxis including structural anchoring proteins (integrins) and signaling proteins (adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, vinculin, paxillin, α-actinin, GTPases etc.) which cause changes in cell shape and actomyosin contractility. These changes are thought to cause cytoskeletal rearrangements in order to facilitate directional migration.

== Function ==
Due to its diverse nature and composition, the ECM can serve many functions, such as providing support, segregating tissues from one another, and regulating intercellular communication. The extracellular matrix regulates a cell&#x27;s dynamic behavior. In addition, it sequesters a wide range of cellular growth factors and acts as a local store for them. Changes in physiological conditions can trigger protease activities that cause local release of such stores. This allows the rapid local growth-factor-mediated activation of cellular functions without &quot;de novo&quot; synthesis.

Formation of the extracellular matrix is essential for processes like growth, wound healing, and fibrosis. An understanding of ECM structure and composition also helps in comprehending the complex dynamics of tumor invasion and metastasis in cancer biology as metastasis often involves the destruction of extracellular matrix by enzymes such as serine proteases, threonine proteases, and matrix metalloproteinases.

The stiffness and elasticity of the ECM has important implications in cell migration, gene expression, and differentiation. Cells actively sense ECM rigidity and migrate preferentially towards stiffer surfaces in a phenomenon called durotaxis. They also detect elasticity and adjust their gene expression accordingly, which has increasingly become a subject of research because of its impact on differentiation and cancer progression.

In the brain, hyaluronan serves as the primary component of the extracellular matrix, contributing to both structural integrity and signaling functions. High-molecular-weight hyaluronan forms a diffusional barrier that regulates local extracellular diffusion. When the ECM undergoes degradation, hyaluronan fragments are released into the extracellular space, where they act as pro-inflammatory molecules, influencing immune cell responses, including those of microglia.

===Cell adhesion===
Many cells bind to components of the extracellular matrix. Cell adhesion can occur in two ways; by focal adhesions, connecting the ECM to actin filaments of the cell, and hemidesmosomes, connecting the ECM to intermediate filaments such as keratin. This cell-to-ECM adhesion is regulated by specific cell-surface cellular adhesion molecules (CAM) known as integrins. Integrins are cell-surface proteins that bind cells to ECM structures, such as fibronectin and laminin, and also to integrin proteins on the surface of other cells.

Fibronectins bind to ECM macromolecules and facilitate their binding to transmembrane integrins. The attachment of fibronectin to the extracellular domain initiates intracellular signalling pathways as well as association with the cellular cytoskeleton via a set of adaptor molecules such as actin.

==Clinical significance==

Extracellular matrix has been found to cause regrowth and healing of tissue. Although the mechanism of action by which extracellular matrix promotes constructive remodeling of tissue is still unknown, researchers now believe that Matrix-bound nanovesicles (MBVs) are a key player in the healing process. In human fetuses, for example, the extracellular matrix works with stem cells to grow and regrow all parts of the human body, and fetuses can regrow anything that gets damaged in the womb. Scientists have long believed that the matrix stops functioning after full development. It has been used in the past to help horses heal torn ligaments, but it is being researched further as a device for tissue regeneration in humans.

In terms of injury repair and tissue engineering, the extracellular matrix serves two main purposes. First, it prevents the immune system from triggering from the injury and responding with inflammation and scar tissue. Next, it facilitates the surrounding cells to repair the tissue instead of forming scar tissue.

For medical applications, the required ECM is usually extracted from pig bladders, an easily accessible and relatively unused source. It is currently being used regularly to treat ulcers by closing the hole in the tissue that lines the stomach, but further research is currently being done by many universities as well as the U.S. Government for wounded soldier applications. As of early 2007, testing was being carried out on a military base in Texas. Scientists are using a powdered form on Iraq War veterans whose hands were damaged in the war.

Not all ECM devices come from the bladder. Extracellular matrix coming from pig small intestine submucosa are being used to repair &quot;atrial septal defects&quot; (ASD), &quot;patent foramen ovale&quot; (PFO) and inguinal hernia. After one year, 95% of the collagen ECM in these patches has been replaced by the body with the normal soft tissue of the heart.

Extracellular matrix proteins are commonly used in cell culture systems to maintain stem and precursor cells in an undifferentiated state during cell culture and function to induce differentiation of epithelial, endothelial and smooth muscle cells in vitro. Extracellular matrix proteins can also be used to support 3D cell culture in vitro for modelling tumor development.

A class of biomaterials derived from processing human or animal tissues to retain portions of the extracellular matrix are called ECM Biomaterial.

==In plants==
Plant cells are tessellated to form tissues. The cell wall is the relatively rigid structure surrounding the plant cell. The cell wall provides lateral strength to resist osmotic turgor pressure, but it is flexible enough to allow cell growth when needed; it also serves as a medium for intercellular communication. The cell wall comprises multiple laminate layers of cellulose microfibrils embedded in a matrix of glycoproteins, including hemicellulose, pectin, and extensin. The components of the glycoprotein matrix help cell walls of adjacent plant cells to bind to each other. The selective permeability of the cell wall is chiefly governed by pectins in the glycoprotein matrix. Plasmodesmata (&quot;singular&quot;: plasmodesma) are pores that traverse the cell walls of adjacent plant cells. These channels are tightly regulated and selectively allow molecules of specific sizes to pass between cells.

==In Pluriformea and Filozoa==
The extracellular matrix functionality of animals (Metazoa) developed in the common ancestor of the Pluriformea and Filozoa, after the Ichthyosporea diverged.

==History==
The importance of the extracellular matrix has long been recognized (Lewis, 1922), but the usage of the term is more recent (Gospodarowicz et al., 1979).

<text>Connective tissue is one of the four primary types of animal tissue, a group of cells that are similar in structure, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. It develops mostly from the mesenchyme, derived from the mesoderm, the middle embryonic germ layer. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. The three meninges, membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord, are composed of connective tissue. Most types of connective tissue consists of three main components: elastic and collagen fibers, ground substance, and cells. Blood and lymph are classed as specialized fluid connective tissues that do not contain fiber. All are immersed in the body water. The cells of connective tissue include fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, mast cells and leukocytes.

The term &quot;connective tissue&quot; (in German, ) was introduced in 1830 by Johannes Peter Müller. The tissue was already recognized as a distinct class in the 18th century.

==Types==

Connective tissue can be broadly classified into connective tissue proper, and special connective tissue. Connective tissue proper includes loose connective tissue, and dense connective tissue. Loose and dense connective tissue are distinguished by the ratio of ground substance to fibrous tissue. Loose connective tissue has much more ground substance and a relative lack of fibrous tissue, while the reverse is true of dense connective tissue.

===Loose connective tissue===
Loose connective tissue includes reticular connective tissue, and adipose tissue.

===Dense connective tissue===
Dense connective tissue also known as fibrous tissue is subdivided into dense regular and dense irregular connective tissue. Dense regular connective tissue, found in structures such as tendons and ligaments, is characterized by collagen fibers arranged in an orderly parallel fashion, giving it tensile strength in one direction. Dense irregular connective tissue provides strength in multiple directions by its dense bundles of fibers arranged in all directions.

===Special connective tissue===
Special connective tissue consists of cartilage, bone, blood and lymph. Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues. Fibroareolar tissue is a mix of fibrous and areolar tissue. Fibromuscular tissue is made up of fibrous tissue and muscular tissue. New vascularised connective tissue that forms in the process of wound healing is termed granulation tissue. All of the special connective tissue types have been included as a subset of fascia in the &quot;fascial system&quot;, with blood and lymph classed as &quot;liquid fascia&quot;.

Bone and cartilage can be further classified as supportive connective tissue. Blood and lymph can also be categorized as fluid connective tissue, and &quot;liquid fascia&quot;.

===Membranes===
Membranes can be either of connective tissue or epithelial tissue. Connective tissue membranes include the meninges (the three membranes covering the brain and spinal cord) and synovial membranes that line joint cavities. Mucous membranes and serous membranes are epithelial with an underlying layer of loose connective tissue.

==Fibrous types==
Fiber types found in the extracellular matrix are collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers.
Ground substance is a clear, colorless, and viscous fluid containing glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans allowing fixation of Collagen fibers in intercellular spaces. Examples of non-fibrous connective tissue include adipose tissue (fat) and blood. Adipose tissue gives &quot;mechanical cushioning&quot; to the body, among other functions. Although there is no dense collagen network in adipose tissue, groups of adipose cells are kept together by collagen fibers and collagen sheets in order to keep fat tissue under compression in place (for example, the sole of the foot). Both the ground substance and proteins (fibers) create the matrix for connective tissue.

Type I collagen is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body.

==Function==

Connective tissue has a wide variety of functions that depend on the types of cells and the different classes of fibers involved. Loose and dense irregular connective tissue, formed mainly by fibroblasts and collagen fibers, have an important role in providing a medium for oxygen and nutrients to diffuse from capillaries to cells, and carbon dioxide and waste substances to diffuse from cells back into circulation. They also allow organs to resist stretching and tearing forces. Dense regular connective tissue, which forms organized structures, is a major functional component of tendons, ligaments and aponeuroses, and is also found in highly specialized organs such as the cornea. Elastic fibers, made from elastin and fibrillin, also provide resistance to stretch forces. They are found in the walls of large blood vessels and in certain ligaments, particularly in the ligamenta flava.

In hematopoietic and lymphatic tissues, reticular fibers made by reticular cells provide the stroma—or structural support—for the parenchyma (that is, the bulk of functional substance) of the organ.

Mesenchyme is a type of connective tissue found in developing organs of embryos that is capable of differentiation into all types of mature connective tissue. Another type of relatively undifferentiated connective tissue is the mucous connective tissue known as Wharton&#x27;s jelly, found inside the umbilical cord. This tissue is no longer present after birth, leaving only scattered mesenchymal cells throughout the body.

Various types of specialized tissues and cells are classified under the spectrum of connective tissue, and are as diverse as brown and white adipose tissue, blood, cartilage and bone. Cells of the immune system—such as macrophages, mast cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils—are found scattered in loose connective tissue, providing the ground for starting inflammatory and immune responses upon the detection of antigens.

==Clinical significance==

There are many types of connective tissue disorders, such as:
* Connective tissue neoplasms including sarcomas such as hemangiopericytoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in nervous tissue.
* Congenital diseases include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
* Myxomatous degeneration – a pathological weakening of connective tissue.
* Mixed connective tissue disease – a disease of the autoimmune system, also undifferentiated connective tissue disease.
* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – a major autoimmune disease of connective tissue
* Scurvy, caused by a deficiency of vitamin C which is necessary for the synthesis of collagen.
* Fibromuscular dysplasia is a disease of the blood vessels that leads to an abnormal growth in the arterial wall.

<text>Flensburg Firth or Flensborg Fjord (; ) is the westernmost inlet of the Baltic Sea. It forms part of the border between Germany to the south and Denmark to the north, on the eastern side of Schleswig Holstein and Jutland, respectively. Its length is between , depending on where it is considered to begin. It has the largest area of all the fjords of East Jutland, which are a special type of inlet, different from geological fjords.

Two peninsulas, Broager on the northern side and Holnis on the southern side, divide the inlet into an outer and an inner part. West of them, near the Danish coast, there are two small islands called Okseøerne (meaning &quot;Ox Isles&quot;).

On the Danish side, the outer part of the northern end of the firth is partly closed off by the island of Als, with the town of Sønderborg on it. Towards the west, continuing on the Danish side, are Broager, Egernsund, Gråsten, Rinkenæs, Sønderhav, and Kollund.

In Germany at the Danish border, there is Harrislee, at the inner end of the inlet the town of Flensburg, east of it on the southern shore the town of Glücksburg and the villages of Munkbrarup, Langballig, Westerholz, Quern, Steinbergkirche, Niesgrau, Gelting, and Nieby.

The tourist attractions of the Flensburg Firth are the church of Broager, the Ox Isles, Sønderborg Castle, Glücksburg Castle, the Naval Academy Mürwik (known as the Red Castle) and the harbour of Flensburg.

<text>Glücksburg (; ) is a small town northeast of Flensburg in the district Schleswig-Flensburg, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, and is the northernmost town in Germany.

It is situated on the south side of the Flensborg Fjord, an inlet of the Baltic Sea, approx. 10 km northeast of Flensburg. The town was originally the home of the family &quot;Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg&quot; (or simply &quot;Glücksburg&quot;), members of which have reigned in the past in Greece and several northern German states. Members of the family still reign in Denmark and Norway since 1863 and 1905 respectively.
Glücksburg was home to a German Navy base. Among the facilities at the base was the transmitter, callsign DHJ58. DHJ58, situated at 54° 50&#x27;N and 9° 32&#x27; E, ceased its transmissions on longwave frequency 68.9 kHz in 2002 and in 2004 its longwave antenna was disassembled.

==Notable people==

* Kai-Uwe von Hassel (1913-1997), politician (CDU), was mayor of Glücksburg, Minister President of Schleswig-Holstein, Federal Minister, President of the Bundestag.
* Gui Bonsiepe (born 1934), designer and design theorist.

<doc id="228851" wikidata="Q2890850" url="?curid=228851" title="Faulty generalization">
<text>A faulty generalization is an informal fallacy wherein a conclusion is drawn about all or many instances of a phenomenon on the basis of one or a few instances of that phenomenon. It is similar to a proof by example in mathematics. It is an example of jumping to conclusions. For example, one may generalize about all people or all members of a group from what one knows about just one or a few people:

* If one meets a rude person from a given country X, one may suspect that most people in country X are rude.
* If one sees only white swans, one may suspect that all swans are white.

Expressed in more precise philosophical language, a fallacy of defective induction is a conclusion that has been made on the basis of weak premises, or one which is not justified by sufficient or unbiased evidence. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions, yet only weakly buttress the conclusions, hence a faulty generalization is produced. The essence of this inductive fallacy lies on the overestimation of an argument based on insufficiently large samples under an implied margin of error.

==Logic==
A faulty generalization often follows the following format:

: The proportion Q of the sample has attribute A.
: Therefore, the proportion Q of the population has attribute A.

Such a generalization proceeds from a premise about a sample (often unrepresentative or biased), to a conclusion about the population itself.

Faulty generalization is also a mode of thinking that takes the experiences of one person or one group, and incorrectly extends it to another.

==Inductive fallacies==
* Hasty generalization is the fallacy of examining just one or very few examples or studying a single case and generalizing that to be representative of the whole class of objects or phenomena.
* The opposite, slothful induction, is the fallacy of denying the logical conclusion of an inductive argument, dismissing an effect as &quot;just a coincidence&quot; when it is very likely not.
* The overwhelming exception is related to the hasty generalization but works from the other end. It is a generalization that is accurate, but tags on a qualification that eliminates enough cases (as exceptions); that what remains is much less impressive than what the original statement might have led one to assume.
* Fallacy of unrepresentative samples is a fallacy where a conclusion is drawn using samples that are unrepresentative or biased.
* Misleading vividness is a kind of hasty generalization that appeals to the senses.
* Statistical special pleading occurs when the interpretation of the relevant statistic is &quot;massaged&quot; by looking for ways to reclassify or requantify data from one portion of results, but not applying the same scrutiny to other categories.
* This can be considered a special case of the fallacy of composition, where the item under discussion is a group, and the fallacy is what can be derived from knowledge of part of the item.

== Hasty generalization ==

&quot;Hasty generalization&quot; is an informal fallacy of faulty generalization, which involves reaching an inductive generalization based on insufficient evidence—essentially making a rushed conclusion without considering all of the variables or enough evidence. In statistics, it may involve basing broad conclusions regarding a statistical survey from a small sample group that fails to sufficiently represent an entire population. Its opposite fallacy is called slothful induction, which consists of denying a reasonable conclusion of an inductive argument (e.g. &quot;it was just a coincidence&quot;).

===Examples===

Hasty generalization usually follows the pattern:

#X is true for A.
#X is true for B.
#Therefore, X is true for C, D, E, etc.

For example, if a person travels through a town for the first time and sees 10 people, all of them children, they may erroneously conclude that there are no adult residents in the town.

Alternatively, a person might look at a number line, and notice that the number 1 is a square number; 3 is a prime number, 5 is a prime number, and 7 is a prime number; 9 is a square number; 11 is a prime number, and 13 is a prime number. From these observations, the person might claim that all odd numbers are either prime or square, while in reality, 15 is an example that disproves the claim.

===Alternative names===
The fallacy is also known as:
*Black swan fallacy 
*Illicit generalization
*Fallacy of insufficient sample
*Generalization from the particular
*Leaping to a conclusion
*Blanket statement
*Hasty induction
*Law of small numbers
*Unrepresentative sample
*&quot;Secundum quid&quot;

When referring to a generalization made from a single example, the terms &quot;fallacy of the lonely fact&quot;, or the &quot;fallacy of proof by example&quot;, might be used.

When evidence is intentionally excluded to bias the result, the fallacy of exclusion—a form of selection bias—is said to be involved.

<text>A jubilee is a special year of remission of sins, debts and universal pardon. In the Book of Leviticus, a jubilee year is mentioned to occur every 50th year (after 49 years, 7x7, as per Lev 25:8, NRSV) during which slaves and prisoners would be freed, debts would be forgiven and the mercies of God would be particularly manifest.

In Western Christianity, the tradition dates to 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII convoked a holy year, following which ordinary jubilees have generally been celebrated every 25 or 50 years, with extraordinary jubilees in addition depending on need. Catholic jubilees, particularly in the Latin Church, generally involve a pilgrimage to a sacred site, normally the city of Rome. 

The most recent holy year was the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy (2015–2016). The present ordinary Jubilee Year of Hope commenced on 24 December 2024.

==Background==

In Jewish tradition, the jubilee year was a time of joy, the year of remission or universal pardon. Leviticus 25:10 reads &quot;Thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year, and shalt proclaim remission to all the inhabitants of thy land: for it is the year of jubilee.&quot;

The same concept forms the fundamental idea of the Christian jubilee. The number 50 was specially associated in the early 13th century with the idea of remission. The translation of the body of Thomas Becket took place in the year 1220, 50 years after his martyrdom. The sermon on that occasion was preached by Cardinal Stephen Langton, who told his hearers that this coincidence was meant by Providence to recall &quot;the mystical virtue of the number fifty, which, as every reader of the sacred page is aware, is the number of remission.&quot;

In the &quot;Chronicle of Alberic of Three Fountains&quot;, under the year 1208 (rather than 1200), is this brief entry: &quot;It is said that this year was celebrated as the fiftieth year, or the year of jubilee and remission, in the Roman Court.&quot; In Ancient Rome, it was said the jubilee was the celebration coinciding with the centenaries since the founding of Rome; this pagan celebration was co-opted into the tradition of the jubilee.

==Definition==
In Roman Catholic tradition, a jubilee or Holy Year is a year of forgiveness of sins and also the punishment due to sin. It is a year of reconciliation between adversaries, of conversion and receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation, &quot;...and consequently of solidarity, hope, justice, commitment to serve God with joy and in peace with our brothers and sisters&quot;. A jubilee can be &quot;ordinary&quot; if it falls after the set period of years or &quot;extraordinary&quot; if it is proclaimed for some outstanding event.

==History==
===First Christian jubilee===
In the face of great suffering caused by wars and diseases such as the plague, thousands of pilgrims came to Rome at Christmas in 1299. Cardinal Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi, the contemporary and counsellor of Pope Boniface VIII, and author of a treatise on the first Christian jubilee, noted that the proclamation of the jubilee owed its origin to the statements of certain aged pilgrims who persuaded Boniface that great indulgences had been granted to all pilgrims in Rome about a hundred years before.

On 22 February 1300, Boniface published the bull &quot;Antiquorum habet fida relatio&quot;, in which, appealing vaguely to the precedent of past ages, he declared &quot;...the most full, pardon of all their sins&quot;, to those who fulfill certain conditions. These are, first, that being truly penitent they confess their sins, and secondly, that they visit the basilicas of St. Peter and St. Paul in Rome, at least once a day for a specified time—in the case of the inhabitants of the city for 30 days, in the case of strangers for 15 days.

The word &quot;jubilee&quot; does not occur in the bull. The pope speaks rather of a celebration which is to occur every 100 years, but writers both Roman and foreign described this year as &quot;annus jubileus&quot;, and the name &quot;jubilee&quot; (though others, such as the &quot;holy year&quot; or &quot;the golden year&quot;, have been used, as well) has been applied to such celebrations ever since. Among those who are recorded as among the pilgrims of that first jubilee are Cimabue, Giotto, Charles, Count of Valois, the chronicler Giovanni Villani, and Dante Alighieri, who mentions it in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; in Canto XXXI of &quot;Paradiso&quot;.

===Jubilee of 1350===
Boniface VIII had intended that the jubilee should be celebrated only once in 100 years. Before the middle of the 14th century, Bridget of Sweden and the poet Petrarch (among others) urged Pope Clement VI, then residing at Avignon, to change this. In 1343, Clement VI assented and issued the bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;, and set the time frame for every 50 years. In 1350, a jubilee was held, and although the pope did not return to Rome, Cardinal Gaetani Ceccano was dispatched to represent him. On this occasion, daily visits to the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran were enjoined, besides those to the basilicas of St. Peter and St. Paul outside the Walls.

===Jubilees of 1390 and 1423===
In virtue of an ordinance of Pope Urban VI, it was proposed to hold a jubilee every 33 years as representing the period of the sojourn of Christ upon earth and also the average span of human life. The next jubilee was held in 1390, and the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore was added to the list. The visits to these four churches has remained as one of the conditions for gaining the Roman jubilee indulgence.

In 1400 so many people came to Rome that Pope Boniface IX granted the indulgence again, though he had not decreed a jubilee year previously. One of the most severe occurrences of plague during the Second plague pandemic was exacerbated by the many pilgrims making their way to and from Rome; in the city itself 600–800 of the faithful died daily.

Another jubilee was proclaimed by Pope Martin V in 1423 (33 years after the last proclaimed jubilee in 1390), but Pope Nicholas V, in 1450, reverted to the period, while in 1470 Pope Paul II decreed that the jubilee should be celebrated every 25 years, and this has been the normal rule ever since. Paul also permitted foreigners to visit some specified church in their own country, and contribute towards the expense of the Holy Wars, as a substitute for the pilgrimage to Rome.

===15th century===
The jubilees of 1450 and 1475 were attended by vast crowds of pilgrims, and that of 1450 was unfortunately made famous by a terrible accident in which nearly 200 people were trampled to death in a panic which occurred on the bridge of Sant&#x27; Angelo. Following this disaster, great pains were taken to widen the thoroughfares and to provide for the entertainment and comfort of the pilgrims by numerous charitable organizations, of which the Archconfraternity of the Holy Trinity, founded by Saint Philip Neri, was the most famous. In 1450, Rome was a largely rural area surrounded by the Aurelian Walls and inhabited by no more than 30,000 people engaged mainly in stock-rearing, in contrast with the economic centres of Florence, Venice, and Milan. Wolves frequented the Vatican Gardens, the population was centred on the Tiber near the Campus Martius, while round the churches of San Giovanni in Laterano and Santa Maria Maggiore were separate villages. Pope Nicholas V used the wealth brought in by pilgrims in the jubilee year of 1450 to convert the medieval city into a Renaissance capital, to found the Vatican Library, and to permanently move the papal seat to the west bank of the Tiber away from the Roman masses who had evicted his predecessor: the Vatican Palace and St Peter&#x27;s Basilica thus replaced St John Lateran as the main papal headquarters. The nearby Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo was rebuilt, along with new fortifications encircling what is now the Vatican City, which Pope Nicholas made his home. According to Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, 40,000 pilgrims arrived in Rome every day for the jubilee in 1450. With them came plague, and some members of the Curia died of the infection while the Pope himself fled Rome for Fabriano in the Apennine Mountains.

In 1500, Pope Alexander VI announced that the Holy Doors in the four major basilicas would be opened simultaneously, and that he himself would open the Holy Door of Saint Peter&#x27;s. The celebrations around this were &quot;founded on ancient rites and full of symbolic meaning&quot; and the total number attending the initial jubilee events was, according to Johann Burchard, an estimated 200,000 people. This act definitively ushered in several customs.

===16th to 17th centuries===
The ninth jubilee was solemnly opened on 24 December 1524, by Pope Clement VII, at a time when symptoms of the great crises which would soon tear the Church apart were already present, with the Protestant Reformation. The 1550 Jubilee was proclaimed by Pope Paul III, but Pope Julius III actually opened it. In 1575, in the time of Pope Gregory XIII, as many as 300,000 people came to Rome from all over Europe. The following Holy Year was proclaimed by Pope Clement VIII in 1600.
In 1625, Pope Urban VIII opened the ceremonial doors for the jubilee year. However, the number of pilgrims was lower than expected due to the wars in northern Italy, so the Pope suspended the declaration of indulgences outside Rome in an attempt to lure the faithful to the city. He then went on to declare a universal or extraordinary jubilee in 1628 to pray for peace. This was repeated the next year in 1629, bringing material benefits to the city. Finally, Innocent X oversaw the last of his jubilees in 1650. Pope Clement X presided over that of 1675 and Pope Clement XI over that of 1700.

===18th to 19th centuries===
Clement XI is remembered especially for establishing one of Rome&#x27;s most renowned charitable institutions, the hospice of San Michele a Ripa. Gradually, other similar institutions were opened to offer shelter and assistance to pilgrims, as in 1725, the Holy Year called by Pope Benedict XIII. A famous preacher during the Jubilee of 1750, proclaimed by Pope Benedict XIV, was Leonard of Port Maurice, who set up 14 Stations of the Cross inside the ruins of the Colosseum. Pope Clement XIV announced the Jubilee of 1775, but died three months before Christmas and the Holy Door was opened by the new pope, Pius VI.

The difficulties faced by the Church during the hegemonic rule of Napoleon prevented Pope Pius VII from proclaiming the Jubilee of 1800, but more than a half a million pilgrims made the journey to Rome for the Jubilee of 1825. Pope Pius VIII declared a further two-week jubilee in 1829, celebrated in Rome from 28 June to 12 July, and over two locally determined weeks outside Rome. Pope Gregory XVI instituted a three-week jubilee over the period from 23 December 1832 to 13 January 1833 in celebration of the start of his pontificate.

The Holy Year could not be celebrated in 1850 because of the unsettled situation in the Roman Republic and the temporary exile of Pope Pius IX. However, he was able to announce a jubilee for 1875, but it was celebrated without any external solemnity, with only the clergy present for the inauguration. The holy doors were not opened, and the pilgrims who came were generally in Rome to do homage to the pope, who had not accepted the Italian annexation of Rome by the troops of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, rather than to obtain an indulgence.

The Jubilee of 1900, though shorn of much of its splendor by the self-confinement of the pope within the limits of the Vatican, was, nevertheless, carried out by Pope Leo XIII with all possible solemnity.

===20th-century jubilees===

In the 20th century, jubilees were held in 1925, 1933 (in commemoration of the 1900th anniversary of the traditional year of Jesus&#x27;s death and resurrection), 1950, 1966 (post-Council jubilee) 1975, 1983 (for the Holy Year of the Redemption: the 1950th anniversary of Jesus&#x27;s death and resurrection), and 2000.

Pope Pius XII used the occasion of the 1950 Jubilee to declare a new pontifical anthem for the Vatican City. With the encyclical &quot;Fulgens corona&quot;, he declared the first Marian year or &quot;Little Holy Year&quot; for 1954. Pope John Paul II proclaimed a Marian year in 1987, again four years after the 1983 Jubilee.

===&quot;Great Jubilee&quot; of 2000===

Pope John Paul II announced a Great Jubilee for the year 2000 with his apostolic letter &quot;Tertio Millennio Adveniente&quot; (&quot;As the Third Millennium Approaches&quot;) of 10 November 1994. In this writing, he called for a three-year preparation period leading up to the opening of the Great Jubilee on 24 December 1999. The first year, 1997, was to be dedicated to meditation on Jesus, the second to the Holy Spirit, and the third to God the Father. This Jubilee was especially marked by a simplification of the rites and the requirements for achieving the indulgence, as well as a huge effort to involve other Christians in the celebration.

Protestants and the Eastern Orthodox Church were invited to celebrate the jubilee together with Catholics as a sign of ecumenism. Furthermore, special jubilees were invoked for various groups within the Church, such as children, athletes, politicians, and actors. World Youth Day, celebrated in Rome in August, brought over two million young people together.

The jubilee was closed by the pope on 6 January 2001, by the closing of the holy door of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica and the promulgation of the apostolic letter &quot;Novo Millennio Ineunte&quot; (&quot;Upon Entering the New Millennium&quot;), which outlined the pope&#x27;s vision for the future of the church.

===Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, 2016===

On 13 March 2015, Pope Francis announced a special jubilee on the theme of mercy to be held from 8 December 2015, until 20 November 2016, and formally convoked the holy year through the papal bull of indiction, &quot;Misericordiae Vultus&quot; (&quot;The Face of Mercy&quot;), on 11 April 2015.

===2025 jubilee===

A jubilee year commenced on 24 December 2024, which will also mark the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea (325 AD). Pope Francis made 2024 a year of prayerful preparation.

== Ceremonial of the jubilee ==

The most distinctive feature in the ceremonial of the jubilee is the unwalling and the final walling up of the &quot;holy door&quot; in each of the four great basilicas which the pilgrims are required to visit. The doors are opened by the pope at the beginning of the jubilee and then sealed up again afterwards. Previously, the rite included the use of a silver hammer (for removing the concrete at the opening) and a silver trowel (for sealing it again after the jubilee). The pope would pound on the wall, which would then be set to collapse. This ritual caused injury to bystanders, so for the Great Jubilee of 2000, Pope John Paul II simplified the rite considerably, opening and closing the doors with his hands.

Traditionally, the pope himself opens and closes the doors of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica personally, and designates a cardinal to open those of St. John Lateran, St. Mary Major, and St. Paul Outside the Walls. In the Great Jubilee, the pope chose to open all the doors personally, while designating cardinals to close all the doors except that of St. Peter&#x27;s.

Catholic parishes all over the world share a similar rite dedicating a door for the purposes of the jubilee year to accommodate its parishioners who do not intend to visit Rome for the occasion. Local parishes&#x27; doors include the same indulgence given to the basilica doors.

==Jubilee &quot;in Perpetuum&quot;==
The Jubilee in perpetuum refers to the possibility, granted by the Holy See, periodically and continuously to celebrate a Jubilee Year in specific locations recognized as centers of spiritual renewal and of particular importance to the Catholic faith.

This privilege has been granted to nine places that can celebrate their Jubilee in perpetuity. These places are: Jerusalem, Rome, Santiago de Compostela, the Monastery of Santo Toribio de Liébana, the Royal Monastery of Santa Maria de Guadalupe, Caravaca de la Cruz, Urda, Valencia, and Ávila.

== Miscellaneous jubilee events ==
In August 2020, Pope Francis approved the extension of the Jubilee Year of Loreto to 2021. The jubilee year marks the 100th anniversary of the official proclamation of Our Lady of Loreto as the patroness of pilots and air passengers. It began 8 December 2019 and was due to end 10 December 2020, the feast of Our Lady of Loreto, but was extended to 10 December 2021 because of disruptions due to the coronavirus.

Pope John Paul II named some of his voyages jubilee pilgrimages: to Mount Sinai and the Holy Land in 2000 and a Jubilee Pilgrimage in the Footsteps of Saint Paul in 2001 to Malta, Syria, and Greece.

==Jubilee indulgence==

This is a plenary indulgence which, as stated by Pope Boniface VIII in consistory, it is the intention of the Holy See to grant in the most ample manner possible. When first conceded, such an indulgence, and also the privilege annexed of choosing a confessor who had power to absolve from reserved cases, was a much rarer spiritual boon than it has since become. So preeminent was the favor then regarded that the custom arose of suspending all other indulgences during the jubilee year, a practice which, with certain modifications, still exists to the present day. The precise conditions for gaining each jubilee indulgence are determined by the Roman pontiff, and they are usually announced in a special Bull, distinct from that which it is customary to issue on the preceding feast of the Ascension giving notice of the forthcoming celebration. The main conditions, however, which do not usually vary, are five: confession, Communion, prayer for the Pope, complete renunciation of all attachment to sin, and visits to the four basilicas during a certain specified period. (The first four are common to all plenary indulgences.) The statement made by some, that the jubilee indulgence, being &quot;a culpa et a paena&quot;, did not of old presuppose either confession or repentance, is absolutely without foundation, and is contradicted by every extant official document of the Roman Catholic Church. Besides the ordinary jubilee indulgence, to be gained only by pilgrims who pay a visit to Rome, or through special concession by certain cloistered religious confined within their monasteries, it has long been customary to extend this indulgence the following year to the faithful throughout the world, though in 2000, the indulgence was extended to the whole world during the jubilee year itself. For this, fresh conditions are appointed, usually including a certain number of visits to local churches and sometimes fasting or other works of charity. Further, the popes have constantly exercised their prerogative of conceding to all the faithful indulgences ad &quot;instar jubilaei&quot; (after the model of a jubilee) which are commonly known as &quot;extraordinary jubilees&quot;. On these occasions, as at the jubilee itself, special facilities are usually accorded for absolution from reserved cases, though on the other hand, the great indulgence is only to be gained by the performance of conditions much more onerous than those required for an ordinary plenary indulgence. Such extraordinary jubilees are commonly granted by a newly elected pontiff at his accession or on occasions of some unexpected celebration, as was done, for example, at the convening of the First Vatican Council, or again at times of great calamity.

Pope John Paul II convoked jubilees in 1983 (Holy Year of the Redemption) and in 2000 (the Great Jubilee). In 2000, he greatly liberalized the conditions for gaining the jubilee indulgence. A visit to only one of the four patriarchal basilicas in Rome was necessary (entering through the holy door). To the four basilicas were added the Sanctuary of Divine Love in Rome, and each diocese was permitted to name a location within the diocese where the indulgence could be gained. For instance, the Diocese of Rome added the chapel in the airport at Fiumicino as a possible pilgrimage site. Most dioceses simply named the local cathedral as the pilgrimage site. Multiple visits were not required. On the last full day of the jubilee, pilgrims were permitted to enter the holy door at St. Peter&#x27;s until late into the night, so that no one would be denied the opportunity to gain the indulgence. The requirements of confession, communion, prayer for the pope, and freedom from all attachment to sin remained in place, as for all plenary indulgences.

<doc id="228860" wikidata="Q2911608" url="?curid=228860" title="Overwhelming exception">
<text>An overwhelming exception is an informal fallacy of generalization. It is a generalization that is accurate, but comes with one or more qualifications which eliminate so many cases that what remains is much less impressive than the initial statement might have led one to believe.

==Examples==
* &quot;Our foreign policy has always helped other countries, except of course when it is against our National Interest...&quot;
:The false implication is that their foreign policy always helps other countries.
The rhetorical use of the fallacy can be used to comic effect, as in the below examples:
* &quot;All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, and public health... &quot;what have the Romans ever done for us!?&quot;&quot; – &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;
:The attempted implication (fallacious in this case) is that the Romans did nothing for them.
*&quot;Well, I promise the answer will always be &quot;yes.&quot; Unless &quot;no&quot; is required.&quot; – &quot;&quot;
*&quot;Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.&quot; – &quot;&quot; by Henry Ford

<text>The First Battle of Bull Run, called the Battle of First Manassas by Confederate forces, was the first major battle of the American Civil War. The battle was fought on July 21, 1861, in Prince William County, Virginia, just north of what is now the city of Manassas and about thirty miles west-southwest of Washington, D.C. The Union Army was slow in positioning themselves, allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail. Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops. The battle was a Confederate victory and was followed by a disorganized post-battle retreat of the Union forces.

Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter, the northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy. Yielding to political pressure, Brigadier General Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, whose forces were camped near Manassas Junction. McDowell&#x27;s ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed although the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage.

Confederate reinforcements under Brigadier General Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A brigade of Virginians under a relatively unknown brigadier general from the Virginia Military Institute, Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, &quot;Stonewall&quot;. The Confederates launched a strong counterattack, and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire, many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout. McDowell&#x27;s men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington, D.C.

Both armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and the many casualties and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated. The First Battle of Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war. Units were committed piecemeal, attacks were frontal, infantry failed to protect exposed artillery, tactical intelligence was minimal, and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively. McDowell, with 35,000 men, could commit only about 18,000, and the combined Confederate forces, with about 32,000 men, also committed 18,000.

==Background==

===Military and political situation===
On December 20, 1860, South Carolina was the first of seven Southern States to declare secession from the Union of the United States. By February 1, 1861, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas passed ordinances of secession, The Constitution of the Confederate States of America was adopted in Montgomery, Alabama on February 8, 1861. On March 1, 1861, Confederate States Army forces assumed control of the military situation at Charleston, South Carolina from state forces. On April 12, 1861, open warfare between the Confederate States and the United States began when Confederate forces barraged Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, which had been occupied by the United States Army since December 26, 1860. On April 15, 1861 (two days after the Federal Army forces surrendered at Fort Sumter, one day after the formal surrender), President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring an insurrection against the laws of the United States had taken place.

To suppress the insurrection of the Confederate States and restore federal law in the Southern States, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers with ninety-day enlistments to augment the existing U.S. Army of about 15,000 present for duty. He later accepted an additional 40,000 volunteers with three-year enlistments and increased the strength of the U.S. Army to 156,861, further enlarged to 183,588 present for duty on July 1. Lincoln&#x27;s actions caused four more Southern states, including Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee, to adopt ordinances of secession and join the Confederate States of America. On May 29, 1861, with the arrival in Richmond, Virginia of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederate States capital had been moved from Montgomery to Richmond.

In Washington, D.C., many of the regiments of volunteers raised by States under Lincoln&#x27;s call rushed to defend the capital. General in Chief Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott laid out his strategy to subdue the Confederate States on May 3, 1861. He proposed that an army of 80,000 men be organized to sail down the Mississippi River and capture New Orleans. While the Army &quot;strangled&quot; the Confederacy in the west, the U.S. Navy would blockade Southern ports along the eastern and Gulf coasts. The press ridiculed what they dubbed as Scott&#x27;s &quot;Anaconda Plan&quot;. Instead, many believed the capture of the Confederate capital at Richmond, only south of Washington, would quickly end the war. By July 1861 many of the thousands of Union volunteers were camped in and around Washington. Since General Scott was seventy-five years old and physically unable to lead this force against the Confederates, the administration searched for a more suitable field commander.

===Irvin McDowell===
Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase championed fellow Ohioan, 42-year-old Maj. Irvin McDowell. Although McDowell was a West Point graduate, his command experience was limited. In fact, he had spent most of his career engaged in various staff duties in the Adjutant General&#x27;s Office. While stationed in Washington he had become acquainted with Chase, a former Ohio governor and senator. Now, through Chase&#x27;s influence, McDowell was promoted three grades to brigadier general in the Regular Army and on 27 May was assigned command (by President Abraham Lincoln) of the Department of Northeastern Virginia, which included the military forces in and around Washington (Army of Northeastern Virginia). McDowell immediately began organizing what became known as the Army of Northeastern Virginia, 35,000 men arranged in five divisions. Under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations, McDowell was given very little time to train the newly inducted troops. Units were instructed in the maneuvering of regiments, but they received little or no training at the brigade or division level. He was reassured by President Lincoln, &quot;You are green, it is true, but they are green also; you are all green alike.&quot; Against his better judgment, McDowell commenced campaigning.

===Intelligence===
During the previous year, U.S. Army captain Thomas Jordan set up a pro-Southern spy network in Washington, D.C., recruiting Rose O&#x27;Neal Greenhow, a prominent socialite with a wide range of contacts. He provided her with a code for messages. After he left to join the Confederate Army, he gave her control of his network but continued to receive reports from her. On July 9 and 16, Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard containing critical information regarding military movements for what would be the First Battle of Bull Run, including the plans of Union general McDowell.

=== McDowell&#x27;s plan and initial movements in the Manassas Campaign ===
On July 16, McDowell departed Washington with the largest field army yet gathered on the North American continent, about 35,000 men (28,452 effectives). McDowell&#x27;s plan was to move westward in three columns and make a diversionary attack on the Confederate line at Bull Run with two columns, while the third column moved around the Confederates&#x27; right flank to the south, cutting the railroad to Richmond and threatening the rear of the Confederate army. He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the Rappahannock River, the next defensible line in Virginia, which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital. McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July, but the troops, unaccustomed to marching, moved in starts and stops. Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to get water, regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks.

The Confederate Army of the Potomac (21,883 effectives) under Beauregard was encamped near Manassas Junction where he prepared a defensive position along the south bank of the Bull Run river with his left guarding a stone bridge, approximately 25 miles (40 km) from the United States capital. McDowell planned to attack this numerically inferior enemy army. Union Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson&#x27;s 18,000 men engaged Johnston&#x27;s force (the Army of the Shenandoah at 8,884 effectives, augmented by Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes&#x27;s brigade of 1,465) in the Shenandoah Valley, preventing them from reinforcing Beauregard.


After two days of marching slowly in the sweltering heat, the Union army was allowed to rest in Centreville. McDowell reduced the size of his army to approximately 31,000 by dispatching Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon with 5,000 troops to protect the army&#x27;s rear. In the meantime, McDowell searched for a way to outflank Beauregard, who had drawn up his lines along Bull Run. On July 18, the Union commander sent a division under Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler to pass on the Confederate right (southeast) flank. Tyler was drawn into a skirmish at Blackburn&#x27;s Ford over Bull Run and made no headway. Also on the morning of 18 July Johnston had received a telegram suggesting he go to Beauregard&#x27;s assistance if possible. Johnston marched out of Winchester about noon, while Stuart&#x27;s cavalry screened the movement from Patterson. Patterson was completely deceived. One hour after Johnston&#x27;s departure Patterson telegraphed Washington, &quot;I have succeeded, in accordance with the wishes of the General-in-Chief, in keeping General Johnston&#x27;s force at Winchester.&quot;

For the maneuver to be successful McDowell felt he needed to act quickly. He had already begun to hear rumors that Johnston had slipped out of the valley and was headed for Manassas Junction. If the rumors were true, McDowell might soon be facing 34,000 Confederates instead
of 22,000. Another reason for quick action was McDowell&#x27;s concern that the ninety-day enlistments of many of his regiments were about to expire. &quot;In a few days I will lose many thousands of the best of this force&quot;, he wrote Washington on the eve of battle. In fact, the next morning two units of McDowell&#x27;s command, their enlistments expiring that day, would turn
a deaf ear to McDowell&#x27;s appeal to stay a few days longer. Instead, to the sounds of battle, they would march back to Washington to be mustered out of service.

Becoming more frustrated, McDowell resolved to attack the Confederate left (northwest) flank instead. He planned to attack with Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler&#x27;s division at the Stone Bridge on the Warrenton Turnpike and send the divisions of Brig. Gens. David Hunter and Samuel P. Heintzelman over Sudley Springs Ford. From here, these divisions could outflank the Confederate line and march into the Confederate rear. The brigade of Col. Israel B. Richardson (Tyler&#x27;s Division) would harass the enemy at Blackburn&#x27;s Ford, preventing them from thwarting the main attack. Patterson would tie down Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley so that reinforcements could not reach the area. Although McDowell had arrived at a theoretically sound plan, it had a number of flaws: it was one that required synchronized execution of troop movements and attacks, skills that had not been developed in the nascent army; it relied on actions by Patterson that he had already failed to take; finally, McDowell had delayed long enough that Johnston&#x27;s Valley force, which had trained under Stonewall Jackson, was able to board trains at Piedmont Station and rush to Manassas Junction to reinforce Beauregard&#x27;s men.

===Prelude to battle===
On July 19–20, significant reinforcements bolstered the Confederate lines behind Bull Run. Johnston arrived with all of his army except for the troops of Brig. Gen. Kirby Smith, who were still in transit. Most of the new arrivals were posted in the vicinity of Blackburn&#x27;s Ford, and Beauregard&#x27;s plan was to attack from there to the north toward Centreville. Johnston, the senior officer, approved the plan. If both of the armies had been able to execute their plans simultaneously, it would have resulted in a mutual counterclockwise movement as they attacked each other&#x27;s left flank.

McDowell was getting contradictory information from his intelligence agents, so he called for the balloon &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which was being demonstrated by Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe in Washington, to perform aerial reconnaissance.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===
McDowell&#x27;s Army of Northeastern Virginia was organized into five infantry divisions of three to five brigades each. Each brigade contained three to five infantry regiments. An artillery battery was generally assigned to each brigade. The total
number of Union troops present at the First Battle of Bull Run was about
35,000 although only about 18,000 were actually engaged.
The Union army was organized as follows:
*1st Division of Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler the largest in the army, contained four brigades, led by Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck, Col. Erasmus D. Keyes, Col. William T. Sherman, and Col. Israel B. Richardson;
*2nd Division of Col. David Hunter of two brigades. These were led by Cols. Andrew Porter and Ambrose E. Burnside;
*3rd Division of Col. Samuel P. Heintzelman included three brigades, led by Cols. William B. Franklin, Orlando B. Willcox, and Oliver O. Howard;
*4th Division of Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon without brigade organization and &quot;not engaged&quot;, contained seven regiments of New Jersey and one regiment of New York volunteer infantries;
*5th Division of Col. Dixon S. Miles included two brigades, commanded by Cols. Louis Blenker and Thomas A. Davies;
While McDowell organized the Army of Northeastern Virginia, a smaller Union command was organized and stationed northwest of Washington, near Harper&#x27;s Ferry. Commanded by Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson, 18,000 men of the Department of Pennsylvania protected against a Confederate incursion from the Shenandoah Valley.

===Confederate===

*The Army of the Potomac (Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard, commanding) was organized into six infantry brigades, with each brigade containing three to six infantry regiments. Artillery batteries were assigned to various infantry brigades. The total number of troops in the Confederate Army of the Potomac was approximately 22,000. Beauregard&#x27;s army also contained thirty-nine pieces of field artillery and a regiment of Virginia cavalry. The Army of the Potomac was organized into seven infantry brigades. These were:
**1st Brigade, under Brig. Gen. Milledge Luke Bonham;
**2nd Brigade, under Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell;
**3rd Brigade, under Brig. Gen. David R. Jones;
**4th Brigade, under Brig. Gen. James Longstreet;
**5th Brigade, under Col. Philip St. George Cocke;
**6th Brigade, under Col. Jubal Early;
**7th Brigade, under Col. Nathan G. Evans.
**Reserve Brigade, under Brig. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes
*The Army of the Shenandoah (Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, commanding) was also organized into brigades. It consisted of four brigades of three to five infantry regiments each, which totaled approximately 12,000 men. Each brigade was assigned one artillery battery. In addition to the infantry, there were twenty pieces of artillery and about 300 Virginia cavalrymen under Col. J. E. B. Stuart. Although the combined strength of both Confederate armies was about 34,000, only about 18,000 were actually engaged at the First Battle of Bull Run. The Army of the Shenandoah consisted of four infantry brigades:
**1st Brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson;
**2nd Brigade, commanded by Col. Francis S. Bartow;
**3rd Brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Barnard E. Bee;
**4th Brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith.

==Battle==

===Morning phase===

====Matthews Hill====
On the morning of July 21, McDowell sent the divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman (about 12,000 men) from Centreville at 2:30 a.m., marching southwest on the Warrenton Turnpike and then turning northwest toward Sudley Springs to get around the Confederates&#x27; left. Tyler&#x27;s division (about 8,000) marched directly toward the Stone Bridge. The inexperienced units immediately developed logistical problems. Tyler&#x27;s division blocked the advance of the main flanking column on the turnpike. The later units found the approach roads to Sudley Springs were inadequate, little more than a cart path in some places, and did not begin fording Bull Run until 9:30 a.m. Tyler&#x27;s men reached the Stone Bridge around 6 a.m.

At 5:15 a.m., Richardson&#x27;s brigade fired a few artillery rounds across Mitchell&#x27;s Ford on the Confederate right, some of which hit Beauregard&#x27;s headquarters in the Wilmer McLean house as he was eating breakfast, alerting him to the fact that his offensive battle plan had been preempted. Nevertheless, he ordered demonstration attacks north toward the Union left at Centreville. Bungled orders and poor communications prevented their execution. Although he intended for Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell to lead the attack, Ewell, at Union Mills Ford, was simply ordered to &quot;hold ... in readiness to advance at a moment&#x27;s notice&quot;. Brig. Gen. D.R. Jones was supposed to attack in support of Ewell, but found himself moving forward alone. Holmes was also supposed to support, but received no orders at all.

All that stood in the path of the 20,000 Union soldiers converging on the Confederate left flank were Col. Nathan &quot;Shanks&quot; Evans and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men. Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge, but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck were merely feints. He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain Edward Porter Alexander, Beauregard&#x27;s signal officer, observing from southwest on Signal Hill. In the first use of wig-wag semaphore signaling in combat, Alexander sent the message &quot;Look out for your left, your position is turned.&quot; Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill, a low rise to the northwest of his previous position.

The Confederate delaying action on Matthews Hill included a spoiling attack launched by Major Roberdeau Wheat&#x27;s 1st Louisiana Special Battalion, &quot;Wheat&#x27;s Tigers&quot;. After Wheat&#x27;s command was thrown back, and Wheat seriously wounded, Evans received reinforcement from two other brigades under Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee and Col. Francis S. Bartow, bringing the force on the flank to 2,800 men. They successfully slowed Hunter&#x27;s lead brigade (Brig. Gen. Ambrose Burnside) in its attempts to ford Bull Run and advance across Young&#x27;s Branch, at the northern end of Henry House Hill. One of Tyler&#x27;s brigade commanders, Col. William Tecumseh Sherman, moved forward from the stone bridge around 10:00 a.m., and crossed at an unguarded ford and struck the right flank of the Confederate defenders. This surprise attack, coupled with pressure from Burnside and Maj. George Sykes, collapsed the Confederate line shortly after 11:30 a.m., sending them in a disorderly retreat to Henry House Hill.

(&quot;Further map details, see:&quot; Additional Map 4, Additional Map 5, Additional Map 6 and Additional Map 7.)

===Noon phase===
====Henry House Hill====
As they retreated from their Matthews Hill position, the remainder of Evans&#x27;s, Bee&#x27;s, and Bartow&#x27;s commands received some cover from Capt. John D. Imboden and his battery of four 6-pounder guns, who held off the Union advance while the Confederates attempted to regroup on Henry House Hill. They were met by generals Johnston and Beauregard, who had just arrived from Johnston&#x27;s headquarters at the M. Lewis Farm, &quot;Portici&quot;. Fortunately for the Confederates, McDowell did not press his advantage and attempt to seize the strategic ground immediately, choosing to bombard the hill with the batteries of Capts. James B. Ricketts (Battery I, 1st U.S. Artillery) and Charles Griffin (Battery D, 5th U.S.) from Dogan&#x27;s Ridge.

Brig. Gen Thomas J. Jackson&#x27;s Virginia Brigade came up in support of the disorganized Confederates around noon, accompanied by Col. Wade Hampton and his Hampton&#x27;s Legion, and Col. J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s cavalry along with a contingent of 6-pounder guns. The Hampton Legion, some 600 men strong, managed to buy Jackson time to construct a defensive line on Henry House Hill by firing repeated volleys at Sherman&#x27;s advancing brigade. Hampton had purchased approximately 400 Pattern 1853 Enfield rifles to equip the men with; however, it is not clear if his troops had them at Bull Run or if the weapons arrived after the battle. If so, they would have been the only foreign-made weapons on the field. The 79th New York was thoroughly decimated by Hampton&#x27;s musket fire and began to disintegrate. Wade Hampton gestured towards their colonel, James Cameron, and remarked &quot;Look at that brave officer trying to lead his men and they won&#x27;t follow him.&quot; Shortly afterwards, Cameron, the brother of US Secretary of War Simon Cameron, was fatally wounded. It has been claimed that Hampton deliberately targeted officers of the 79th New York in revenge for the death of his nephew earlier in the day, although he had in fact been killed by soldiers of the 69th New York.
Jackson posted his five regiments on the reverse slope of the hill, where they were shielded from direct fire, and was able to assemble 13 guns for the defensive line, which he posted on the crest of the hill; as the guns fired, their recoil moved them down the reverse slope, where they could be safely reloaded. Meanwhile, McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan&#x27;s Ridge to the hill for close infantry support. Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across against Jackson&#x27;s 13. Unlike many engagements in the Civil War, here the Confederate artillery had an advantage. The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges, with many shots fired over the head of their targets.


One of the casualties of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry, an 85-year-old widow and invalid, who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House. As Ricketts began receiving rifle fire, he concluded that it was coming from the Henry House and turned his guns on the building. A shell that crashed through the bedroom wall tore off one of the widow&#x27;s feet and inflicted multiple injuries, from which she died later that day.

As his men were pushed back towards Henry House Hill, Bee exclaimed to Jackson, &quot;The Enemy are driving us.&quot; Jackson, a former U.S. Army officer and professor at the Virginia Military Institute, is said to have replied, &quot;Then, Sir, we will give them the bayonet.&quot; Bee is then said to have exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, &quot;There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians.&quot; This exclamation is often held to be the source for Jackson&#x27;s (and his brigade&#x27;s) nickname, &quot;Stonewall&quot;. Bee was shot through the stomach shortly afterwards and died the next day, thus it is unclear exactly what he said or meant. Moreover, none of his subordinates wrote reports of the battle, so there is no first-hand account of the exchange. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson&#x27;s failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee&#x27;s and Bartow&#x27;s brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee&#x27;s statement was meant to be pejorative: &quot;Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall!&quot; After Bee&#x27;s wounding, Col. States Rights Gist, serving as Bee&#x27;s aide-de-camp, took command of the brigade.

Artillery commander Griffin decided to move two of his guns to the southern end of his line, hoping to provide enfilade fire against the Confederates. At approximately 3 p.m., these guns were overrun by the 33rd Virginia, whose men were outfitted in blue uniforms, causing Griffin&#x27;s commander, Maj. William F. Barry, to mistake them for Union troops and to order Griffin not to fire on them. Close range volleys from the 33rd Virginia followed by Stuart&#x27;s cavalry attack against the flank of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Ellsworth&#x27;s Fire Zouaves), which was supporting the battery, killed many of the gunners and scattered the infantry. Capitalizing on this success, Jackson ordered two regiments to charge Ricketts&#x27;s guns and they were captured as well. As additional Federal infantry engaged, the Confederates were pushed back and they reformed and the guns changed hands several times.
The capture of the Union guns turned the tide of battle. Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill, outnumbering the Confederates two to one, no more than two were ever engaged simultaneously. Jackson continued to press his attacks, telling soldiers of the 4th Virginia Infantry, &quot;Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards! Then fire and give them the bayonet! And when you charge, yell like furies!&quot; For the first time, Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the Rebel yell. At about 4 p.m., the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. Philip St. George Cocke&#x27;s brigade.

To the west, Chinn Ridge had been occupied by Col. Oliver Otis Howard&#x27;s brigade from Heintzelman&#x27;s division. But at 4 p.m., two Confederate brigades-Col. Jubal Early&#x27;s, which had moved from the Confederate right, and Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith&#x27;s (commanded by Col. Arnold Elzey after Smith was wounded), which had just arrived from the Shenandoah Valley, moved forward and crushed Howard&#x27;s brigade. Beauregard ordered his entire line forward, and the Union troops began to panic in retreat. At 5 p.m. everywhere McDowell&#x27;s army was disintegrating. Thousands, in large and small groups or as individuals, began to leave the battlefield and head for Centreville in a rout. McDowell rode around the field trying to rally regiments and groups of soldiers, but most had had enough. Unable to stop the mass exodus, McDowell gave orders for Porter&#x27;s regular infantry battalion, near the intersection of the turnpike and
Manassas-Sudley Road, to act as a rear guard as his army withdrew. The unit briefly held the crossroads, then retreated eastward with the rest of the army. McDowell&#x27;s force crumbled and began to retreat.

(&quot;Further map details, see:&quot; Additional Map 8, Additional Map 9, Additional Map 10, Additional Map 11 and Additional Map 12.)

===Union retreat===
The retreat was relatively orderly up to the Bull Run crossings, but was poorly managed by the Union officers. A Union wagon was overturned by artillery fire on a bridge spanning Cub Run Creek, inciting panic in McDowell&#x27;s force. As the soldiers streamed uncontrollably toward Centreville, discarding their arms and equipment, McDowell ordered Col. Dixon S. Miles&#x27;s division to act as a rear guard, but it was impossible to rally the army short of Washington. In the disorder that followed, hundreds of Union troops were taken prisoner. Wagons and artillery were abandoned, including the 30-pounder Parrott rifle, which had opened the battle with such fanfare. Expecting an easy Union victory, the wealthy elite of nearby Washington, including congressmen and their families, had come to picnic and watch the battle. When the Union army was driven back in a running disorder, the roads back to Washington were blocked by panicked civilians attempting to flee in their carriages. The pell-mell retreat became known in the Southern press as &quot;The Great Skedaddle&quot;.

Since their combined army had been left highly disorganized as well, Beauregard and Johnston did not fully press their advantage, despite urging from Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who had arrived on the battlefield to see the Union soldiers retreating. An attempt by Johnston to intercept the Union troops from his right flank, using the brigades of Brig. Gens. Milledge L. Bonham and James Longstreet, was a failure. The two commanders squabbled with each other and when Bonham&#x27;s men received some artillery fire from the Union rear guard, and found that Richardson&#x27;s brigade blocked the road to Centreville, he called off the pursuit.

In Washington, President Lincoln and members of the cabinet waited for news of a Union victory. Instead, a telegram arrived stating &quot;General McDowell&#x27;s army in full retreat through Centreville. The day is lost. Save Washington and the remnants of this army.&quot; The tidings were happier in the Confederate capital. From the battlefield President Davis telegraphed Richmond, &quot;We have won a glorious but dear-bought victory. Night closed on the enemy in full flight and closely pursued.&quot;

==Aftermath==

===Brief observations===
The battle was a clash between relatively large, ill-trained bodies of recruits, led by inexperienced officers. Neither army commander was able to deploy his forces effectively; although nearly 60,000 men were present at the battle, only 36,000 had actually been engaged. Although McDowell had been active on the battlefield, he had expended most of his energy maneuvering nearby regiments and brigades, instead of controlling and coordinating the movements of his army as a whole. Other factors contributed to McDowell&#x27;s defeat: Patterson&#x27;s failure to hold Johnston in the valley; McDowell&#x27;s two-day delay at Centreville; allowing Tyler&#x27;s division to lead the march on 21 July, thus delaying the flanking divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman; and the -hour delay after the Union victory on Matthews&#x27; Hill, which allowed the Confederates to bring up reinforcements and establish a defensive position on Henry Hill. On Henry Hill, Beauregard had also limited his control to the regimental level, generally allowing the battle to continue on its own and only reacting to Union moves. Johnston&#x27;s decision to transport his infantry to the battlefield by rail played a major role in the Confederate victory. Although the trains were slow and a lack of sufficient cars did not allow the transport of large numbers of troops at one time, almost all of his army arrived in time to participate in the battle. After reaching Manassas Junction, Johnston had relinquished command of the battlefield to Beauregard, but his forwarding of reinforcements to the scene of fighting was decisive. Jackson and Bee&#x27;s brigades had done the largest share of fighting in the battle; Jackson&#x27;s brigade had fought almost alone for four hours and sustained over 50% casualties.

===Detailed casualties===
Bull Run was the largest and bloodiest battle in United States history up until that point. Union casualties were 460 killed, 1,124 wounded, and 1,312 missing or captured; Confederate casualties were 387 killed, 1,582 wounded, and 13 missing (a very high 10% casualty rate of the troops engaged in battle, excluding missing or captured). Among the Union dead was Col. James Cameron, the brother of President Lincoln&#x27;s first Secretary of War, Simon Cameron. Among the Confederate casualties was Col. Francis S. Bartow, the first Confederate brigade commander to be killed in the Civil War. General Bee was mortally wounded and died the following day.

Compared to later battles, casualties at First Bull Run had not been especially heavy. Both Union and Confederate killed, wounded, and missing were a little over 1700 each. Two Confederate brigade commanders, Jackson, and Edmund Kirby-Smith were wounded in the battle. Jackson was shot in the hand and so he remained on the battlefield. No Union officers above the regimental level were killed; two division commanders (Samuel Heintzelman and David Hunter) and one brigade commander (Orlando Willcox) were wounded.

===Effect on Union and subsequent events===
Union forces and civilians alike feared that Confederate forces, 14,000 not engaged in the battle and thus rested, would advance on Washington, DC, only 27 miles away , with very little standing in their way. On July 24, Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe ascended in the balloon &quot;Enterprise&quot; to observe the Confederates moving in and about Manassas Junction and Fairfax. He saw no evidence of massing Confederate forces but was forced to land in Confederate territory. It was overnight before he was rescued and could report to headquarters. He reported that his observations &quot;restored confidence&quot; to the Union commanders.

The Northern public was shocked at the unexpected defeat of their army when an easy victory had been widely anticipated. Some Northerners visited to overlook the battlefield and picnic since they expected the battle would be won easily. Both sides quickly came to realize that the war would be longer and more brutal than they had imagined. On July 22, President Lincoln signed a bill that provided for the enlistment of another 500,000 men for up to three years of service. On July 25, 11,000 Pennsylvanians who had earlier been rejected by the U.S. Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, for federal service in either Patterson&#x27;s or McDowell&#x27;s command arrived in Washington, DC, and were finally accepted.

Three months after the First Battle of Bull Run, Union forces suffered another, smaller defeat at the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff, near Leesburg, Virginia. The perceived military incompetence at both battles led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs. Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run, the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell&#x27;s army. Although the committee&#x27;s report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson&#x27;s failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard, Patterson&#x27;s enlistment had expired a few days after the battle, and he was no longer in the service. The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat, and McDowell bore the chief blame. On July 25, he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who would soon be named general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen. John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia thirteen months later, at the Second Battle of Bull Run.

===Effect on Confederacy===
The reaction in the Confederacy was more muted. There was little public celebration, as the Southerners realized that despite their victory, the greater battles that would inevitably come would mean greater losses for their side as well. Once the euphoria of victory had worn off, Jefferson Davis called for 400,000 additional volunteers.

Beauregard was considered the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by President Davis to full general in the Confederate army. Stonewall Jackson, arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory, received no special recognition but would later achieve glory for his 1862 Valley Campaign. Privately, Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory. Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow: &quot;Our President and our General direct me to thank you. We rely upon you for further information. The Confederacy owes you a debt. (Signed) JORDAN, Adjutant-General.&quot;

The battle also had long-term psychological consequences. The decisive victory led to a degree of overconfidence on the part of Confederate forces and prompted a determined organizational effort on the part of the Union. In hindsight, commentators on both sides agreed that the one-sided outcome &quot;proved the greatest misfortune that would have befallen the Confederacy.&quot; Although modern historians generally agree with that interpretation, James M. McPherson has argued that the &quot;esprit de corps&quot; attained by Confederate troops on the heels of their victory, together with a new sense of insecurity felt by northern commanders, also gave the Confederacy a military edge in the following months.

===Confederate victory: turning point of the American Civil War===
===&quot;Bull Run&quot; vs. &quot;Manassas&quot;===
The name of the battle has caused controversy since 1861. The Union Army frequently named battles after significant rivers and creeks that played a role in the fighting; the Confederates generally used the names of nearby towns or farms. The U.S. National Park Service uses the Confederate name for its national battlefield park, but the Union name (Bull Run) also has widespread currency in popular literature.

===Confusion between battle flags===
Battlefield confusion between the battle flags, especially the similarity of the Confederacy&#x27;s &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; and the Union&#x27;s &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; when it was fluttering, led to the adoption of the Confederate Battle Flag, which eventually became the most popular symbol of the Confederacy and the South in general.

===Conclusions===
The First Battle of Bull Run demonstrated that the war would not be won by one grand battle, and both sides began preparing for a long and bloody conflict. The battle also showed the need for adequately trained and experienced officers and men. One year later, many of the same soldiers who had fought at First Bull Run, now combat veterans, would have an opportunity to test their skills on the same battlefield at the Second Battle of Bull Run/Manassas.

==In popular culture==

The First Battle of Bull Run is mentioned in the novel &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, but is depicted more fully in its film adaptation. The battle forms the climax of the film &quot;Class of &#x27;61&quot;. It also appears in the first episode of the second season of the mini-series &quot;North and South&quot;, in the second episode of the first season of the mini-series &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; and in the first episode of the mini-series &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot;. &quot;Manassas&quot; (1999) is the first volume in the James Reasoner Civil War Series of historical novels. The battle is described in &quot;Rebel&quot; (1993), the first volume of Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s The Starbuck Chronicles series of historical novels. The battle is described from the viewpoint of a Union infantryman in Upton Sinclair&#x27;s novella &quot;Manassas&quot;, which also depicts the political turmoil leading up to the Civil War. The battle is also depicted in John Jakes&#x27;s &quot;The Titans&quot;, the fifth novel in The Kent Family Chronicles, a series that explores the fictional Confederate cavalry officer Gideon Kent. The battle is the subject of the Johnny Horton song, &quot;Battle of Bull Run&quot;. &quot;Shaman&quot;, second in the Cole family trilogy by Noah Gordon, includes an account of the battle. The battle is also depicted in the song &quot;Yankee Bayonet&quot; by indie-folk band The Decemberists. In &quot;Murder at 1600&quot;, Detective Harlan Regis (Wesley Snipes) has built a plan-relief of the battle which plays a certain role in the plot.

==Sesquicentennial==

Prince William County staged special events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Civil War through 2011. Manassas was named the No. 1 tourist destination in the United States for 2011 by the American Bus Association for its efforts in highlighting the historical impact of the Civil War. The cornerstone of the commemoration event featured a reenactment of the battle on July 23–24, 2011. Throughout the year, there were tours of the Manassas battlefield and other battlefields in the county and a number of related events and activities.

The City of Manassas commemorated the 150th anniversary of the battle July 21–24, 2011.

==Battlefield preservation==
Part of the site of the battle is now Manassas National Battlefield Park, which is designated as a National Battlefield Park. More than 900,000 people visit the battlefield each year. As a historic area under the National Park Service, the park was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have preserved more than 385 acres of the battlefields at Manassas in 15 transactions since 2010, mostly on the Second Manassas Battlefield.

<doc id="228886" wikidata="Q1571099" url="?curid=228886" title="Order of the Solar Temple">
<text>The Order of the Solar Temple (, OTS), or simply the Solar Temple, was a new religious movement and secret society, often described as a cult, notorious for the mass deaths of many of its members in several mass murders and suicides throughout the 1990s. The OTS was a neo-Templar order, claiming to be a continuation of the Knights Templar, and incorporated an eclectic range of beliefs with aspects of Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, and New Age ideas. It was led by Joseph Di Mambro, with Luc Jouret as a spokesman and second in command. It was founded in 1984, in Geneva, Switzerland.

Di Mambro, a French jeweler and esotericist with a history of fraud, co-led the group with Jouret, a Belgian homeopath known for lecturing on alternative medicine and spirituality. Di Mambro had founded several past esoteric groups, and had previous affiliation with a number of other organizations. This included The Pyramid and the Golden Way Foundation, a New Age group founded by Di Mambro that the OTS replaced. The OTS was founded by Jouret and Di Mambro out of a schism from the separate neo-Templar group the Renewed Order of the Temple (ORT), which Jouret had taken over and then been kicked out of. The group was active throughout several French-speaking countries. Its practices focused largely on ritualistic elements, with beliefs in the ascended master figures of Theosophy, who they believed resided on the star Sirius. Its members were largely affluent former Catholics.

Following increasing legal and media scandal, including investigations over arms trafficking and pressure from an ex-member, as well as conflict within the group, the founders began to prepare for what they described as &quot;transit&quot; to Sirius. In 1994, Di Mambro first ordered the murder of a family of ex-members in Quebec, before orchestrating mass suicide and mass murder on two communes in Switzerland. In the following years, there were two other mass suicides of former OTS members in France in 1995 and in Quebec in 1997. In total, 74 people died in the course of these events; it is not known how many of the specific deaths were murder and how many were suicides.

The OTS was a major factor that led to the strengthening of the anti-cult movement in Europe, particularly in Francophone Europe. Due to the death of all high ranking members of the organization, the only one alive to be held responsible was Swiss composer Michel Tabachnik, who had involvement with Di Mambro and was the president of the Golden Way Foundation. Tabachnik was tried in France after the second mass suicide, but was acquitted twice in two separate trials, found to be innocent on all counts. In the aftermath, many conspiracy theories revolving around the events resulted, some alleging government and organized crime involvement.

== Classification ==

The precise definition or classification as to what kind of movement the Solar Temple was by academics is inconsistent; scholars have labeled it variously as an esoteric new religious movement, a neo-Templar group, a Rosicrucian organization, a doomsday or suicide cult, a new magical movement, a magical-esoteric religion, or a secret society, among others. Stephen A. Kent and Melodie Campbell classified the group as a UFO religion. According to Henrik Bogdan, what the OTS is classified as depends on &quot;how these labels are defined and what aspects of the OTS are emphasized.&quot;

Shannon Clusel and Susan J. Palmer described the OTS as a neo-Templar movement, with influence from the philosophies of Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, and the New Age. Bogdan emphasized their status as a masonic initiatory society. Massimo Introvigne has classified them as one of many neo-Templar movements; organizations that claim, through adherence to a set of myths about the secret survival of the Knights Templar, to actually be a continuation of that movement. Such groups were often affiliated with masonic rites and freemasonry.

The organization was described by the Quebec coroner investigating the case as incorporating a variety of traditions, but as primarily inspired by occultism, due to its belief in pseudoscientific practices, and practices unrecognized by other religions, which required special initiation. Palmer viewed the Solar Temple as fitting within anthropologist Mary Douglas&#x27;s conception of a &quot;strong group, weak grid&quot; society (with a strong sense of social cohesion, or &quot;group&quot;, and a weak clarity of group meanings system, or &quot;grid&quot;), due to the immense pressure it placed on individual members in combination with its &quot;vague and confusing classification system&quot;. These societies, according to Douglas, often exhibit a dualistic cosmology, in which the group does not view justice as winning over evil forces.

== Organization ==
The group used many names during its existence, sometimes multiple at once. Following the deaths, &quot;Solar Temple&quot; has been used as the overall common term. The &quot;Order of the Solar Temple&quot; formally was only a part of the larger organization; many members of the &quot;core&quot; of the organization were never actual members of the &quot;OTS&quot; proper. Many aspects of the group&#x27;s organizational structure were in flux, as is the case in many NRMs; the organization had several layers, compared to a chinese box by scholars. The most public face of the organization was the Amenta Club (later Atlanta), which had Luc Jouret lecture on New Age-related issues, including ecology, homeopathy, and naturopathy; from the Amenta Club recruitment was done to the more secretive Archedia Clubs, which involved the ritual elements. The third, and apparently most secretive layer, was the International Order of Chivalry Solar Tradition, or the Order of the Solar Temple.

The OTS had a strict hierarchy with three degrees, in the structure of an initiatory Masonic society: the Frères du Parvis, Chevaliers de l’Alliance, and Frères des Temps Anciens (the Brothers of the Court, Knights of the Alliance, and Brothers of the Former Times). The three levels of membership corresponded to the three degrees of initiation: initiates, awakened souls, and immortals. For each degree, a rite of initiation was undergone by the member; specifics of each ceremony varied, but in one ritual (&quot;The Dubbing of a Knight&quot;) the officiants were mentioned as: Priest, Deacon, Ritual Master, Matre, Chaplain, Sentinel, Master of Ceremonies, Guardian, and Escorts. The precise relation of these hierarchies to the organization at large is unclear, with the degrees possibly constituting an even more selective group, which some sources call the Synarchy of the Temple. Outside of this framework was the fourth organization, the Golden Way Foundation (previously La Pyramide), which was the parent structure of both the Archedia and Amenta clubs. Members of the OTS paid a monthly membership fee and lived communally.

== Beliefs and practices ==

As an esoteric movement, teachings of the OTS were only elaborated upon to those advanced enough in the organization. Members progressed through several related movements – the Amenta Club, then the Archedia Club, then to the OICST. Most of the dead were the high ranking members, with those left surviving being the lower ranking who had less access to the ideas of the group; this has caused difficulties in investigating their beliefs by scholars. Many members of the OTS were wealthy and socially successful, in contrast to many other cults; members were often middle-aged professionals who were highly cultured. This drew from its approach, elitist and interested in aesthetics, with a religious view that was non-fundamentalist. Its members were almost exclusively cultural Catholics, to whom it offered a type of religious mysticism and ritual that had been minimized by the Catholic Church in the previous decades.

The more odd beliefs of the OTS (e.g. reincarnation, or the Brotherhood) were hidden behind hermeneutics. The Order did not have one coherent method of syncretizing its system of eclectic beliefs. In a way similar to ancient gnostic systems of thought, the OTS did not have a &quot;normative theology&quot;, instead utilizing allegory and symbolism in an interpretive manner to clarify their own beliefs in the context of existing practices. Though it contained tenets of gnosticism, its approach to this was experimental, and its members also partook in a variety of occult subjects, with occultists of varying systems of beliefs being invited to do workshops for the OTS.

The OTS took a large portion of its ideology from the French alchemist Jacques Breyer, inheriting from Breyer&#x27;s works occult-apocalyptic themes. His books were circulated within the organization; Breyer&#x27;s book espouses the &quot;solar Christ&quot; concept. It also says the world had reached the end of time; one chart calculates the &quot;End of Incarnation&quot; as &quot;1999.8&quot;. Other dates it gave were 2147, 2156, or 2666, though said others were possible, as they were based on simple calculations. The precise date was viewed as less important than the preparation for the end. In another chart, he says that based on the year Jesus had born that the &quot;Grand Monarchy&quot; of the world &quot;ought to Leave this world around 1995–96.&quot;

Jouret defined seven principles of the Order of the Solar Temple, which were taken basically unaltered from Breyer&#x27;s Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple (OSTS). The OSTS wrote their seven principles as follows:

# Re-establishing the correct notions of authority and power in the world.
# Affirming the primacy of the spiritual over the temporal.
# Giving back to man the conscience of his dignity.
# Helping humanity through its transition.
# Participating in the Assumption of the Earth in its three frameworks: body, soul, and spirit.
# Contributing to the union of the Churches and working towards the meeting of Christianity and Islam.
# Preparing for the return of Christ in solar glory.
Some commentators have suggested influences from Eastern religions; Emmanuelle was referred to as an avatar, though this term was not used in any philosophical sense, and Jouret believed the world to be in the Kali Yuga, as in Hinduism. Jouret&#x27;s usage of the term was not in line with Hindu usage, being a much shorter period (6,000 instead of 432,000 years), more similar to Western astrological ideas. These and related concepts are widespread within New Age and Theosophical movements, and any further inspiration is contested. According to Chyrissides, Di Mambro&#x27;s contrasting of Emmanuelle as the avatar with the antichrist showed that he still thought in a quasi-Christian manner.

The OTS was heavily influenced by the theosophist Alice Bailey. In particular, the preoccupation with the star Sirius and her emphasis on the theosophical concept of the Ascended Masters had influenced the Rosicrucian revival; Di Mambro also utilized her Great Invocation to begin Temple ceremonies. Jacques Breyer, and the New Age movement generally, had drawn heavily from Bailey&#x27;s ideas. Bailey also introduced the &quot;reappearance of the Christ&quot; concept, where Jesus had been a medium for the &quot;Christ&quot;, who, towards the end of the 20th century, as long as a certain set of conditions were fulfilled, would reappear to herald a new age, which would coincide with the drawing of the Masters close to humanity.

=== Ascended Masters and Sirius ===

In OTS theology, the star Sirius was a focal point, as the &quot;Blue Star&quot; that had appeared roughly 26,000 years ago. Following the appearance of the star, the universe&#x27;s history could be divided into several &quot;ages&quot;, viewing the present moment as being one in which the world was moving from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius; this belief in the astrological ages was shared with several other New Age and occult groups. In the OTS&#x27;s view, the arrival of the Age of Aquarius would result in the apocalypse, with the Earth being consumed by fire. The OTS then aimed to create a group of souls dedicated to surviving this apocalypse.

The OTS believed Sirius to be the home of the &quot;Ascended Masters&quot; (also called the Great White Brotherhood). The OTS conceived of the Ascended Masters as having arrived on earth, where they inhabited Agartha (an underground spiritual realm popular in esoteric thought). Their belief in the Ascended Masters was shared by the Theosophical Society. The Masters were, in the OTS&#x27;s conception, effectively souls with the ability to manifest in physical form; both the Masters and human beings were perceived as souls who were merely temporarily occupying their bodies, and at the time of death would move on to another. The OTS believed that advanced or elite members could, at will, &quot;de-corporealize&quot;, in accordance with their degree of initiation into the OTS.

=== Reincarnation ===
Both the Masters and human beings were believed to be capable of reincarnation, a key aspect of OTS theology. OTS members believed themselves to be reincarnated versions of the original Templars who had been burned at the stake with grandmaster Jacques de Molay, and even further, members of a class of people who had been reborn since ancient times, whose purpose in the world was to fulfill a &quot;cosmic mission&quot;. Di Mambro personally claimed he was a reincarnation of, among others, an Egyptian pharaoh, one of the Twelve Disciples, Longinus (the Roman soldier who pierced Jesus&#x27;s side during the crucifixion) and an Ascended Master, Manatanus. Jouret claimed he was a reincarnation of Bernard of Clairvaux, founder of the original Knights Templar. Di Mambro often revealed these past lives to members, in the process giving them new spiritual identities. In doing this, according to Susan J. Palmer, both drama and the illusion of spiritual progress were applied to the member&#x27;s time in the group.

The OTS was said to believe that souls had no gender, however Chryssides notes this is difficult to reconcile with the &quot;cosmic marriage&quot; doctrine, as well as the explicitly gendered nature of the Ascended Masters who were always consistent in gender throughout their incarnations. One former OTS member expressed the idea that the &quot;inner self&quot; was sexless, with there being no difference between the souls of the sexes. The &quot;Cosmic Child&quot; was always referred to as a he, despite being a girl.

=== Cosmic coupling ===
One important OTS practice was &quot;cosmic coupling&quot; or &quot;cosmic marriage&quot;. Following Di Mambro&#x27;s reveal of a member&#x27;s past lives, either Di Mambro or Jouret — though Jouret himself was forced by Di Mambro to separate from his wife due to &quot;cosmic incompatibility&quot; — forced apart married couples and put them with other members. A ceremony was performed bonding the &quot;discarnate archetypal forms&quot; of the paired members. Di Mambro himself was bonded with Bellaton in a ceremony (viewed as the reincarnation of Hatshepsut). Di Mambro claimed he did this as the will of the &quot;Cosmic Masters&quot;.

The goal of these cosmic couples was to birth seven or nine elite &quot;cosmic children&quot;, one of whom was his daughter Emmanuelle (another included Tabachnik&#x27;s son). According to Di Mambro, these seven children would form &quot;the conscience of the new humanity&quot; and were raised to fulfill this role. The &quot;Cosmic Child&quot; Emmanuelle was the subject of worship by group members; though her specific role in the group is unclear it was unique in the group. She underwent a special baptism of water from the Jordan River and Jerusalem-sourced chrismal oil. At the time of the mass suicides, there were only five cosmic children. In splitting up a couple, Di Mambro explained to them that their &quot;karmic cycle&quot; had been fulfilled; they were reassigned to a new partner, whereupon they were sent off on a mission together.

These pairings often had large age gaps: Dominique Bellaton (in her 30s) was paired with Patrick Vuarnet who was 14 years younger, Gerry Genoud was a decade younger than his cosmic wife, Thierry Huguenin&#x27;s marriage was broken apart and his wife (in her 30s) was matched with Di Mambro&#x27;s 14 year old son. Another cosmic couple had a 30-year age gap. Bruno Klaus, upon leaving his wife at Di Mambro&#x27;s order, declared: &quot;The Masters have decided. I am going to live with another woman&quot;. While marriage was idealized in the OTS, the leaders encouraged defamilialization through this practice. Ex-members often complained they were forced into these cosmic unions, though other ex-members said the OTS did not intrude in their personal or family lives.

=== Ritual ===
Ritual was an important aspect of the OTS&#x27;s beliefs, described as its &quot;core activity&quot; by scholar Hendrik Bogdan. According to George D. Chryssides, what the OTS offered was a &quot;mystical mood&quot; that was available to all, not just those who were &quot;spiritually gifted&quot;; in a way similar to traditional Catholicism, through ritual the core messages of the group could be made available to those who were not well versed in the systems of thought used to understand it. There were a number of initiation rituals, of a Masonic nature – not in being directly related to actual freemasonry, but in their type of ritual practice, which once it was established afterwards spread outside of freemasonry. The OTS&#x27;s initiation rituals were typical of neo-Templar groups but also incorporated aspects of New Age, Rosicrucian and alchemical practice.

One initiation ritual, the &quot;Reception Ceremony&quot; of the Hermetica Fraternitas Templi Universali (the name for the OTS in the English speaking world), which was the official initiation into the first degree , member candidates called aspirants are first given a copy of the oath they will take so they can become familiar with it (an uncommon practice for other Masonic initatory societies). The ritual objects used for the ritual include: a Templar cross, a sword, a three branched candelabrum with white candles, a vase containing a red rose, a red cushion, an altar, a sacred book (e.g. a Bible open to the Gospel of John), a red votive candle, and crosses, which are given out to the initiates. The ritual must include six officiants for the initiates. Compared to other Masonic rituals, it starts simply, with the playing of Bach&#x27;s Toccata and the lighting of the votive candle, before the assembly is brought in, the candelabrum is lit and the chief officiant of the ritual opens and calls for prayer.

The chief officiant then explains the ritual&#x27;s purpose and tells those present to meditate on the importance of what is about to happen. The aspirants are then brought in, and Gregorian chants are played; the chief officiant asks them if they wish to continue. They are informed that by taking the oath it reaches &quot;beyond human limitation&quot;, and once they take the oath their life will be towards the &quot;Path of Service, of Light, and Unity&quot;, and that the member&#x27;s &quot;field of consciousness will broaden and your scale of values will change, giving the full significance to the notions of Honour, Loyalty, Courage, Disciple and Effort&quot;, whose concerns should now be to &quot;preserve and respect the Consciousness of Life, to maintain Harmony and radiate Love&quot;. Following this, the Vigia (a role probably restricted to female OTS members) or the chancellor would tell the aspirants the meaning of the ritual items used, before the aspirants are made to approach the altar, kneel on their right knee and place their right hand on the book, and read their oath aloud, before signing it. After this is completed, the chief officiant declares that they have reached the degree and gives them a cross as the emblem of the Order, which they are told has been blessed by an &quot;Official Priest&quot; and that all members should wear it during meetings.

Then, at the end, the &quot;Templar Psalm&quot; is read thrice. This psalm is included in many Solar Temple initiation rituals, and reads:

After, the chief officiant extinguishes the flames of the candles and candelabrum and announces the end of his work. Hallelujah is then played and everyone except the &quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot; and the &quot;Guardian&quot; positions leave. Another Order TS (the English aspect of the OTS) ritual, &quot;The Dubbing of a Knight&quot; (not an admission ritual, but probably a second degree ritual), states that the knighthood can only be granted by either the Grand Master (Di Mambro), the Deputy Grand Master, or &quot;a dignitary&quot; appointed by the Order. It is Catholic in nature and includes a mass performed at the same time. The oath given in this ritual reads thus:

In another ritual, the &quot;Traditional Ritual for the Donning of the Talar&quot;, which is more complicated, the candidate is &quot;purified&quot; and sheds their clothes, standing only in their underwear to &quot;cast[...] off all impurities&quot;. Scholar Hendrik Bogdan noted several of its lines as &quot;particularly ominous&quot; in light of the deaths. In one part it is stated that

As well as the rituals of initiation, there were mystical or magical rituals. Underground sanctuaries were built by the group, hidden behind false walls and only accessible through secret passageways: to enter them, a member would have to take a ritual number of 22 steps (probably a reference to the 22 paths of the Tree of Life in Kabbalah). In one ceremony attended by cult researcher Jean-François Mayer in the summer of 1987, in order to commemorate the summer solstice, the Templars held a bonfire in the French countryside. Following their lighting of the fire, there were instructions and the members turned around the fire only clockwise. Mayer said during the event that it was ritual, whereupon a member corrected him and said it was not merely ritual but &quot;something much more&quot;.

One of these rituals was where ranking members could supposedly witness the masters manifest in the underground chambers of the group, in what were actually holographic shows by Antonio Dutoit. OTS rituals may have involved hallucinogens, and utilized visual effects as well as music. Among the utilized effects were lightning effects, through which the masters and ritual objects like the Holy Grail were seen to appear. In order to achieve the community of souls that would survive the apocalypse, the OTS invoked sex magic, in which sexual activities are performed in order to acquire spiritual gain, though how much this was actually practiced is unclear.

=== Transit ===

The &quot;transit&quot; terminology and concept is derived from AMORC, which Di Mambro had been a member of. AMORC uses &quot;transit&quot; as a term meaning death, among other vocabulary the OTS borrowed from the organization. AMORC, as with the OTS, saw death as merely a &quot;transition&quot;, in which the physical body separates from the soul; unlike the soul, the physical body will change and decay.

The concept had first been brought up by Di Mambro in 1990 or 1991. It was to mean a voluntary departure of the members to another dimension in space, or an act of consent to bring the &quot;germ of life&quot; to another planet. He told the members that they would be summoned on short notice, and would need to be ready as this could occur any day. They conceptualized the transit as a ritual involving magic fire, where they would undergo a spiritual voyage to the star Sirius. According to Di Mambro, he did not know yet how they would transit, though he metaphorically evoked the idea of being picked up by a flying saucer or passing across a mirror. OTS members were familiar with similar ideas prior: in 1987, Jouret had for sale at one of his lectures a comic strip,&quot;Voyage Intemporel,&quot; that tells of a group of UFO believers who are picked up before a great cataclysm. Following the gun scandal, Jouret began speaking of the transit concept as well.

Palmer argued that the transit could have been viewed as a solution for many of the problems the OTS faced. It prevented the &quot;loss of charisma&quot; that Di Mambro would have to deal with given his old age and illness, as well as his suffering personal relationships with others. The problems of succession that the group faced, with conflict between Jouret and Di Mambro and Jouret&#x27;s leadership problems in Canada, would also be solved. One interpretation was that it may have been a funeral intended for a Pharaoh (as Di Mambro was interested in Egyptian mythology), intended to bring Di Mambro&#x27;s &quot;retinue&quot; with him into the afterlife and keep his power.

According to the later testimony of members, they did not interpret it as mass suicide, with one stating that they believed the transit was instead the idea of being &quot;saved&quot; from disaster. Members otherwise interpreted it innocuously or as an ephemeral concept, such as one interpretation of the transit being that the group would simply move to another geographical location or leave Geneva. According to Mayer, the transit concept was perhaps not a break with the OTS&#x27;s earlier survivalist ideas, but instead a continuation, a survival in other dimensions where this one was irreversibly doomed.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The OTS was one of numerous neo-Templar organizations active in France and Switzerland in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These organizations followed a tradition of claiming unbroken descent from a lineage of grand masters that claimed to go back to the original medieval Knights Templar; the original Knights Templar had been dissolved by Pope Clement V following accusations of witchcraft and heresy at the beginning of the fourteenth century. In 1310, 54 Templar knights were burned at the stake, and four years later the Grand Master and a local leader were as well. French esotericist and alchemist Jacques Breyer initiated a resurgence of neo-Templar groups in France in 1952. This &quot;Arginy renaissance&quot; was tied to a claimed mystical experience in the Castle of Arginy, which led to the founding of the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple (OSTS), which was formally created in 1966.

Joseph Di Mambro was a French jeweler with an interest in esotericism. After scamming a business partner in the late 1960s, Di Mambro fled France, before returning to Pont-Saint-Esprit in 1972 and acting as a psychiatrist. Soon after, he was sentenced to six months in prison for writing bad checks, breaching patient trust, and for impersonating a psychiatrist. In the late 1960s, he became a member and lodge leader of the AMORC organization in Nîmes, France. AMORC is the largest contemporary Rosicrucian organization, structured into lodges which performed initiation rituals into specific degrees. Luc Jouret was a Belgian homeopath. He traveled widely studying various forms of alternative and spiritual healing, before settling in Annemasse and practicing homeopathy there.

=== The Pyramid and Golden Way ===
In 1973, Di Mambro founded and became president of the Center for the Preparation of the New Age (, CPAN). CPAN was a yoga school, but also presented itself as a &quot;cultural center for relaxation&quot;. In 1976, eight people including Di Mambro, most of whom lived together, formed a building society in Collonges-sous-Salève and bought a building that they called &quot;The Pyramid&quot; (). The group was also called by its members the Fraternity of the Pyramid (). This hid an esoteric society, consecrated as the Temple of the Great White Universal Lodge, Pyramid Sub-Lodge 24 June 1976. In June 1977, Di Mambro met orchestral conductor Michel Tabachnik, who, having an interest in esotericism, attended and became a member.

On 12 July 1978, Di Mambro founded the Golden Way Foundation (). The Golden Way became the center of activities in Di Mambro&#x27;s variety of groups. Several members donated large amounts of money, allowing them to buy a property in Saconnex-d&#x27;Arve (Geneva) which hosted meetings, including for non-members. The Golden Way functioned as a &quot;front&quot; for a smaller group of people, the &quot;Fraternity&quot;, which undertook secret esoteric rites. The Fraternity, like many other New Age organizations in the 1970s, had communal ideals, holding all their property communally. This attracted members — one member had previously been in the Scottish Findhorn New Age group — but also disappointed them when the reality of the group failed to live up to the ideal. As well as the Fraternity there was the &quot;Community&quot;, which was made up of members who kept their income and paid for rent/food and drink.

While the group&#x27;s headquarters were impressive, the group lacked a successful communicator with which to spread its ideas. In 1981, Jouret was invited as a speaker, and spoke about homeopathic medicine at one of their conferences. Di Mambro was impressed by him, and invited Jouret to join, and he was officially accepted into the group alongside his wife on 30 May 1982, where he quickly rose in the ranks. Di Mambro then told others that Jouret possessed charisma, so he should be the frontman for the group, while Di Mambro controlled it from behind the scenes. Jouret became the group&#x27;s &quot;propagandist&quot; and began giving lectures promoting it in 1983.

=== Cosmic child ===
In June 1981, Di Mambro, then 57, began an affair with then 21-year-old Dominique Bellaton. He later claimed to receive a revelation from the &quot;masters&quot; that Bellaton would produce a &quot;cosmic child&quot; through theogamy. About that time, Jouret founded the Amenta Club (later renamed simply Amenta, then Atlanta). In 1982, Di Mambro announced that a &quot;great mission&quot; awaited the foundation. He also announced that a &quot;child-king&quot; was to be born into the community. Di Mambro had actually impregnated Dominique Bellaton, a former manicurist, who was well known in Geneva and had previously had several affairs with businessmen. Di Mambro claimed that this child&#x27;s conception was created from the power of his mind and Immaculate Conception.

Their child, initially named Anne Bellaton, was born on 22 March 1982. The child was viewed as &quot;the Christ of the new generation&quot;, but was born female, something attributed by Di Mambro to human imperfection (believing the child&#x27;s mother being human had led to an imperfect Christ). Di Mambro claimed the child was an Avatar, a male soul trapped in a female body. She was then renamed Emmanuelle (the male version, Emmanuel, being Jesus&#x27;s messianic name), but was referred to with male pronouns. He required Emmanuelle to wear gloves and a helmet to protect her purity as the &quot;cosmic child&quot;, who he considered the &quot;messiah-avatar&quot; of the planet&#x27;s new age.

=== Renewed Order of the Temple ===

In 1970, French legate of AMORC Raymond Bernard established the neo-Templar group the Renewed Order of the Temple (ORT) at the suggestion of Julien Origas, who was given control of the group shortly after. During a meeting of the ORT and the OSTS with the Golden Way Foundation in 1981, Julien Origas met Jouret. Origas was impressed by him, and invited him to come to Auty with him and join ORT. Jouret was initiated into ORT, quickly rising into its leadership ranks. Jouret and Origas became close, and Origas may have appointed Jouret to be his successor and the next Grand Master.

Origas died in 1983, after which Di Mambro urged Jouret to take over the order, and he became its new grand master that year. The same year, Michel Tabachnik was made president of the Golden Way Foundation. Jouret was initially accepted by the remaining ORT members as successor, but began introducing new and foreign concepts into the ORT, inspired by Di Mambro&#x27;s ideas. Jouret was never consecrated as Grand Master, which was an important process to many esoteric groups, and he was not an officer in the legal aspects of the organization; this was used to oust him in 1984.

=== Founding ===
Following this, the ORT schismed. Jouret had no legal right to the ORT name, so he founded a splinter group in Geneva, Switzerland upon his ousting, alongside Di Mambro, in 1984. Jouret later claimed that this schism had been the will of the ascended masters, who had appeared to him two years prior and revealed to him a 13 year plan until the world ended. This group was formally created 21 June 1984, and at the time of its creation the Golden Way Foundation was formally dissolved (though &quot;Golden Way&quot; was still used to refer to the group&#x27;s Geneva commune, that still had 50 members). It was first called the ORT–Solar Tradition before being renamed the International Chivalric Order of the Solar Tradition (, OICTS or OICST) and finally the Order of the Solar Temple (OTS). Jouret, a compelling speaker, was the &quot;front man&quot; for this organization, though Di Mambro was the actual leader.

The OTS was dually schismatic and a direct continuation of the original ORT, with occult-apocalyptic teachings descended from that of Jacques Breyer and Origas, which it tied to other apocalyptic concepts, and some white supremacist ideas from Origas. Breyer attempted to mediate the schism, suggesting the groups separate with goodwill; Breyer&#x27;s mediation did not work and the OTS and the other branch of ORT grew to dislike one another. He suggested that Jouret and Di Mambro&#x27;s group transfer to Canada to spread the movement. The ORT already had some Canadian administration in Trois-Rivières and Quebec City, which were led by Robert Falardeau. To convince him to help them find land in Canada, Falardeau was given the title of &quot;grand financier&quot; by Jouret and Di Mambro. From then on, the group&#x27;s most active locations were in French-speaking Europe and Quebec; from Quebec, the group intended to spread its influence to the United States, and began a translation project to make OTS ideas available to English speakers. This was mostly unsuccessful, as the OTS never had more than a few American members. In the English speaking world, the OTS went by the names Order TS and Hermetica Fraternitas Templi Universali.

In 1985, Di Mambro decided to set up a survival center in Canada in the event of nuclear war. An estate, named Sacred Heart () was purchased in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, Quebec, to create an organic farm. The organization set up several subsidiaries, both official and hidden, to finance these real estate purchases; Di Mambro made a profit by reselling his stakes in these purchases to members. Di Mambro, Jouret, Dominique Bellaton and Camille Pilet bought four semi-detached chalets on Chemin Belisle in Morin-Heights, Quebec and, with members&#x27; money, several other houses for OTS activities (including a farm in Cheiry, Canton of Fribourg) managed by member Albert Giacobino.

Di Mambro had asked Tabachnik to draw up a series of writings to inspire him to rise in ranks within the order, called the Archées. Many of the Order&#x27;s concepts and principles were inspired by these writings, third degree initiatory texts. Written between 1984 and 1989, they were made up of 21 articles, each ranging from 15 to 20 pages. They were considered difficult to understand even by members of the OTS.

== Decline ==
The group reached its membership height in January 1989, with 442 members: 187 in Metropolitan France, 90 in Switzerland, 86 in Canada, 53 in Martinique, 16 in the US, and 10 in Spain, from which they gained more than $36,000 in monthly revenue overall. Most members of the OTS had little contact with the leadership, and little or no idea of their violent plans. Some financially successful members individually donated amounts ranging from the hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to the group, to finance the &quot;life centers&quot;; however, some of the money was instead used to fund the leader&#x27;s own travel expenses, and cost of living expenses for OTS members who did not have other support. The group began to have financial problems.

Beginning in the late 1980s, several members began to doubt Di Mambro. In 1990, Di Mambro&#x27;s son Elie discovered that the apparitions that appeared during OTS ceremonies were faked, operated by Tony Dutoit, who confirmed this, before leaving the group. Elie, who also realized that the &quot;masters&quot; his father presented did not exist, then revealed this to other members. Some members explained the falsification away as necessary to keep &quot;weaker souls&quot; in the group, but numerous other members, whose faith in the group had been previously damaged by the silencer scandal, left the group and demanded a reimbursement of money they had donated. Joseph Di Mambro promised to return the sums requested, but several OTS members resigned in quick succession in 1990, leaving only the core group of OTS members. Many people, including Elie and many high-ranking members, left.

The Archedia clubs were dissolved in 1991. The members of the Sacred Heart commune disliked Jouret, accusing him of a lack of financial transparency and sexual exploitation of women. He was viewed as a dictator by the Quebec members of the group, and was also not present often as he constantly traveled. There was a resulting power struggle between the Quebec and Swiss templars. As a result Jouret slowly become less prominent in the leadership role of the Solar Temple and quit its executive committee in January 1993.

=== Anti-cult movement ===
The OTS had largely escaped negative public attention from the anti-cult movement in the 1980s, other than two lines published in a French anti-cult booklet about Jouret in 1984. He and the group were left out of later 1980s editions. In 1991, a former member, Rose-Marie Klaus, contacted a Montreal cult-watching organization, Info-Secte, and following that the group produced a letter warning other organizations in Canada about the group.

Klaus&#x27;s husband had left her for a &quot;cosmic marriage&quot; to another woman, and she wanted money she had given to the organization returned; she sued the group, and attempted to get negative press coverage on the OTS. While her husband Bruno Klaus (later dead in the 1997 mass suicide) had been getting increasingly involved in the OTS, Rose-Marie was growing less involved, but continued to live with him near the group&#x27;s compound. One day, Bruno arrived home, and told her that the OTS masters had decided that he was to be with another woman; Rose-Marie, upset by this, asked Jouret to mediate between them. His solution to this issue followed the OTS practice of &quot;cosmic coupling&quot;, which ignored &quot;earthy marriage&quot;; he set up Rose-Marie with another man, André Friedli, later one of the killers in the 1995 incident. Rose-Marie was not satisfied with this and it only briefly lasted. She stated that &quot;I saw later that this man went with other women, the women had other men. It was very mixed up.&quot;

For several years after this, she repeatedly tried to get Bruno back, having a &quot;foot inside, but always one outside&quot; the OTS community, but eventually gave up, and began contacting anti-cult groups. On 10 September 1991, the president of Martinique&#x27;s branch of the Association for the Defense of Families and Individuals (the leading French anti-cult group), asked various Canadian associations for information on the group in a letter, following several Martinicans leaving the island to join them. In 1992, after an invitation from a French cult-watching organization, Klaus visited Martinique, where she denounced the group. Her statements were picked up on by the local media.

=== Gun scandal ===
The next year the group encountered further trouble. The police of Canada, which was then investigating Q-37 (a mysterious group that threatened to assassinate Canadian public officials, which was eventually determined to have never existed), believed the OTS may have been involved. Soon after, the group&#x27;s locations in Quebec were raided and two members were arrested on grounds of possession of illegal weapons. Jouret had asked the men to buy three semi-automatic guns with silencers, illegal in Canada, resulting in the three being arrested. Jouret and the other two men were given only light sentences after the crime (one year of unsupervised probation and a $1000 fine intended to be paid to the Red Cross), but in the aftermath the media took interest in the group. The Canadian press began to report, using information gained from police wiretaps, conversations between members of the OTS, which they described as a &quot;doomsday cult&quot;.

Though Jouret had encouraged some members of the OTS to learn to shoot, at the time, members of Info-Secte believed the group to be of a survivalist nature, and that they intended to use the weapons to defend themselves after an apocalypse; a representative of Info-Secte publicly expressed his confusion as to why they needed silencers for this purpose. Even tabloid newspapers that covered the OTS, which ran lurid stories about the organization, did not indicate they believed them capable of violence. In March 1993, some members of the group tried to convince the press that the OTS was harmless and mostly dedicated to moral improvement and gardening, and denied allegations of being a cult.

Following the arrests, other countries and agencies began investigating as well. Two days after the men were arrested, the Sûreté du Québec announced an inquiry into the financial aspects of the group, with the Australian police launching a parallel investigation later in the year. A bulletin from Interpol alleged that Di Mambro and Odile Dancet had been involved in two banking transactions in Australia, each worth $93 million. In 1994, the French authorities delayed the reissue of Jocelyne Di Mambro (Di Mambro&#x27;s wife)&#x27;s passport due to an investigation. At the same time, a former member of the OTS, Thierry Huguenin, called Di Mambro and demanded his money back, threatening to file a criminal complaint if he did not. In February 1994 a photocopied letter was mailed to about 100 members, revealing financial misuse, the reveal of which made both Di Mambro and Jouret furious. In March, the Canadian RCMP were helping the Australian Federal Police in an investigation over possible money laundering by the OTS, and the Swiss authorities also received Australian bulletins. Later on, there was no evidence found of money anywhere close to that amount, or money laundering, but this led to conspiracies.

The OTS viewed itself as increasingly persecuted, though according to Jean-François Mayer, there was little actual opposition to the group, with Quebec Public Security Minister Claude Ryan explicitly stating the government would not surveil cult members in the wake of reports on the group, and denying information claiming the group had planned to commit terrorist attacks in Canada. The leadership believed the increasing legal and media attention to be both a conspiracy against the OTS and a sign of the Kali Yuga, and the group&#x27;s ideas became increasingly focused on environmental destruction and ecological collapse.

Compounding the difficulties, Di Mambro also began having issues with Emmanuelle. Though she had been raised from birth to be a messiah figure, by the age of 12 she had become uncooperative, rejecting her role in the group and taking an interest in typical teenage pop culture. He believed her to be under threat from the Antichrist, who, he believed, was born to Tony and Nicky Dutoit in summer 1994. Di Mambro had previously forbidden Nicky from giving birth, but after she left the group, they had a son, whom they named Christopher Emmanuel. Di Mambro, deeply offended by the name similarity, the disobeying of his instructions, and that he had not been consulted in the naming of the infant, ordered the family be murdered later in 1994.

== Mass murders and suicides ==

=== Planning ===
Given the scale of the issues facing the group leaders, it was decided they would &quot;transit&quot; to Sirius. The OTS termed the acts a &quot;transit&quot;, which they described as &quot;in no way a suicide in the human sense of the term&quot;. In their view, traitors would be simply murdered, while &quot;weaker&quot; members would be &quot;helped&quot; to transit, and the remaining members considered strong enough would kill themselves. Members believed that, upon death, they would acquire &quot;solar bodies&quot; in a faraway location in space (typically given as the star Sirius, but alternatively Jupiter or Venus). The group&#x27;s leaders wrote four letters expressing these views, known as &quot;The Testament&quot;, which contained messages of the order&#x27;s beliefs. Patrick Vuarnet was instructed by Di Mambro to mail the Testament letters to several people. Shortly before the end of the group, the OTS was renamed as Alliance Rosy-Cross (, ARC, with the public name of the Association for Cultural Research) in a final meeting in September 1994, though this may have actually been intended as a new organization.

These letters divided the dead into three groups.

* &quot;Traitors&quot;, who were murdered
* &quot;Immortals&quot;, who had been &quot;helped&quot; in death (killed) by other members
* &quot;Awakened&quot;, who had committed voluntary suicide

=== Morin-Heights, Cheiry and Salvan ===
On 30 September 1994, the Dutoits were lured to Di Mambro&#x27;s chalet in Morin-Heights by Dominique Bellaton. Two members, Joël Egger and Jerry Genoud killed the family, repeatedly stabbing them, including the three month old child. As ordered by Di Mambro, these murders were carried out in a ritualistic fashion. Bellaton and Egger left for Switzerland the same day, while the Genouds spent the next four days cleaning up the scene and preparing for death. On 4 October they set incendiary timers to go off and burn the house down, dying as a result.

During the night from 2 to 3 October 1994, 23 died in Cheiry. 20 of the dead had been shot with one gun; 21 of them had died from gunshot wounds, previously drugged with sleeping pills, with another two dying of suffocation from plastic bags. The ones who had killed the others in Cheiry were Egger and Jouret, though it is possible they were not the only ones. In Salvan, the dead had been injected with poison; according to the investigative report, it is likely that the fatal injections at Salvan were done by Line Lheureux, with Annie Egger doing the same to the children. On the morning of 5 October, the Testament letters were mailed out.

On 4 October 1994, the bodies of the Genouds were found in the burned out chalet; the next day the bodies of the Dutoits were found in the building&#x27;s cellar. On 5 October, Swiss examining magistrate André Piller was called by the police to respond to a fire at Cheiry, arriving half an hour later, where the bodies were discovered. Soon after this they heard news the fire in Granges-sur-Salvan, of the three villas; when the fires there died down, they found the bodies in Salvan. These two fires were connected when Egger&#x27;s car, who lived in the Cheiry house, was found parked outside the Salvan commune, and the next day, the Canadian police realized that there was likely a connection between the Morin-Heights fire and the Swiss ones as the properties were owned by the same men.

The leadership of the OTS cared deeply about the group&#x27;s legacy, and spent a large amount of time preemptively creating a &quot;legend&quot; through both the manifestos they mailed to various media and scholarly sources, and by destroying all evidence that would have conflicted with their own story. This plan was disrupted, as some of the ignition devices had failed. This failure left behind a large number of the Temple&#x27;s written documents, some of which were found on the group&#x27;s surviving computers, as well as audio and video cassettes, able to be looked through by investigators.

According to Thierry Huguenin, Jouret and Di Mambro had planned for there to be exactly 54 dead, in connection with 54 Templars who had been burned at the stake in the fourteenth century. This was to allow an immediate magic contact with these departed Templars. However, Huguenin escaped from the scene last minute, having sensed danger, which left the death toll at only 53. After the event, some other members declared their continued support for the group&#x27;s ideas, and even regretted not having been chosen for the &quot;transit&quot;. A Swiss magistrate concluded that of the fifty two deaths, only fifteen were suicides.

=== Vercors ===
On the morning of 16 December 1995, 14 members of the OTS, including three children, were immolated in a circular star-formation in an isolated clearing on the Vercors massif, near Saint-Pierre-de-Chérennes in France. Two other bodies were found near them. The investigation conducted by the Grenoble Gendarmerie hypothesized that the 14 people, including three children, took sedative pills; then Jean-Pierre Lardanchet and André Friedli shot each member in the head one by one with two .22 caliber rifles. After that, they poured gasoline on the bodies and set them on fire, before they both shot themselves in the head with two .357 Magnum revolvers. The bodies of the two perpetrators were found alongside the burned ones. On 23 December 1995, the 16 bodies were discovered after a missing persons investigation by the gendarmerie, after having been led to the bodies by a hunter.

The plot had been orchestrated by Christiane Bonet, a devoted former member of the OTS who said she could commune with Jouret and Di Mambro from the afterlife. Some of those who died left behind notes where they discussed that they would &quot;see another world&quot;. Investigators concluded that of the 16 dead, at least four had not died willingly.

=== Saint-Casimir ===
On 22 March 1997, five members of the Solar Temple died in a mass suicide in Saint-Casimir, Quebec, burning their house down with them inside. The dead included two couples: Chantal and Didier Quèze, as well as Pauline Riou and Bruno Klaus (Rose-Marie Klaus&#x27;s ex-husband), and one of their parents. Responding officers found three teenage survivors at the scene, the children of the Quèzes, who were found to be drugged. Following the first failed attempt to initiate the mass suicide (that included them against their will), the children had negotiated their right to live with their parents, who eventually agreed that they did not have to die. Following this, the adults continually failed to burn the house down, becoming increasingly sick, until eventually the teenagers burned the house down at their parents&#x27; request.

The children were ultimately not charged with any crime, as the fact that they had been drugged and the influence the cult could have had on them was viewed as mitigating their responsibility. The adults had mailed a transit letter to several Canadian news outlets, in which they explained that they had taken their own lives believing that their deaths would let them &quot;transit&quot; to another planet to continue living.

== Aftermath ==
In the wake of the deaths, fear of cults took hold of the French and Swiss populations. The group immediately became well known. The members of the OTS were noted as not conforming to the usual idea of a cultist, vulnerable and easy to influence, but were instead respected members of society in powerful positions, some of whom were very rich, a surprise to many. The group&#x27;s actions were a major factor in the toughening of the fight against cults in France, resulting in a general rise in opposition against purported cults. After the deaths, Swiss cantonal authorities founded the Centre intercantonal d&#x27;information sur les croyances, an organization meant to provide information on cults. The acts of the Solar Temple prompted European governments to begin to monitor new and nontraditional religious movements, and also influenced the American anti-cult movement. Following the deaths, on 29 June 1995 the French National Assembly voted, unanimously, to appoint the Guyard Commission to study the phenomenon of cults.

In the following years, the French media accused other cults/sects of being like the Solar Temple, plotting their own mass suicides; included among them the Unification Church and Scientology, as well as Aumists and Raëlians. The Raëlians were particularly affected by this, repeatedly accused of plotting mass suicide. The leader of the Raëlians, Raël, responded to the affair by saying: &quot;If those idiots in the Solar Temple decided to kill themselves, that is not our problem&quot; and &quot;why do the journalists always call me for comment when there&#x27;s a collective suicide? I don’t want to die! I want to be around to piss them off for a long time!&quot; The Raëlians put out a press release stating that suicide was against their belief system. The Aumists were also affected, being told by the police that there was a rumor they would commit mass suicide &quot;like the Solar Temple&quot;. In January 1998, a group called the Atman Foundation was suspected of plotting ritual suicide in the Teide National Park in the Canary Islands; police of the island had announced they had prevented another OTS suicide, which made headlines around the world. It was later clarified that they were unrelated groups. Later investigations of that group failed to turn up proof of the ritual suicide allegation, and the leader was acquitted of all charges.

In the trial and media coverage of Néo-Phare, a small French cult, the group was frequently compared to the Solar Temple. &quot;Le Figaro&quot; declared it the &quot;new OTS&quot;, and journalists compared the leader Arnaud Mussy to Jouret and Di Mambro. Psychologist and cult expert Jean-Marie Abgrall said during the trial of that group that they were like the Solar Temple, as both groups recorded their meetings and practiced swinging. A former member discussed with the news a comparison between Néo-Phare&#x27;s doctrine and the Solar Temple&#x27;s concept of going to Sirius, and in one instance, TF1 producers (who wanted the exclusive rights to make a documentary about the case) wanted them to look like the Solar Temple, surprised at their lack of belief similarities, and when they found out they did not have many, they left. Susan Palmer argued the trial of Mussy may have been an attempt by the French justice system to compensate for the innocent verdict in the Tabachnik trial. The OTS suicides had shocked the French public, and due to the failure of the justice system to convict the only person who ever went on trial in the case, there was no &quot;satisfying&quot; conclusion, deeply frustrating the French authorities.

=== Legal proceedings ===

On 23 December 1995, during the &quot;journal de 13 heures&quot; program on the French channel TF1, journalist Gilles Bouleau claimed that the group had survived and united behind Michel Tabachnik, indirectly declaring that Tabachnik was the mastermind behind the Vercors incident. Tabachnik was investigated following the incident; Fontaine placed him under examination on 12 June 1996 for conspiracy. At the time of the investigation, due to the death of the two leaders in Salvan in 1994, Tabachnik was the only defendant in the case. The examining magistrate considered that Tabachnik, through his writings and his conferences, could have incited followers to commit suicide. He was therefore charged with participation in a criminal conspiracy.

On 13 April 2001, at the Grenoble Museum-Library, which had been transformed for the occasion, the court trial of Michel Tabachnik for &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot; began. The plaintiffs&#x27; side split into two camps; one camp, led by Alain Vuarnet, felt that the trial should not focus on Tabachnik&#x27;s responsibility but on the investigation itself, which they felt had not been thorough. Another, led by the anti-cult group UNADFI, believed that Tabachnik and his writings were the cause of the mass suicides, and that cults must be eradicated. On 25 June 2001, the court acquitted Tabachnik, on the basis that there had been no conclusive proof found of any involvement, and his writings accused of influencing the members into death were deemed unlikely to have influenced them. The public prosecutor appealed the criminal court&#x27;s decision, and Tabachnik was tried again in a second trial beginning 24 October 2006. The appeals court upheld the lower court&#x27;s ruling, and he was acquitted a second time in December 2006.

=== Media and conspiracies ===
Due in part due to the difficulty of explaining many aspects of the OTS, conspiracy theories were common. One former member claimed that the evidence of murder had been fabricated by the Sûreté du Québec, and another claimed that the murders were actually a CIA operation to cover up a deal Jimmy Carter had supposedly made with a group of aliens living in an underground laboratory in Nevada. In 1996, a documentary was in production that claimed that Jouret was actually still alive. As described by Susan J. Palmer, &quot;false or unverifiable trails have been laid: secondhand testimonies are traded by journalists, ghost-written apostate memoirs are in progress and conspiracy theories abound.&quot; Initial media and anti-cult movement responses focused largely on the idea that the members had been brainwashed, but when the relative affluence of the members was realized, they were considered to not fit the typical conception of a brainwashing victim (i.e. young, poor).

Narratives then shifted to a conspiratorial one, in which the OTS was not actually a cult but a front for something else entirely, involving organized crime, money laundering, and the secret services of several countries. The claimed amount of 93 million dollars in their accounts was found to be inaccurate, and there was no evidence ever found of money laundering, but this narrative fueled conspiracies and much press speculation. In one version of the theory, commentators alleged connections between the OTS and various political scandals, citing alleged links between Jouret and members of Gladio. Many books have been written by journalists promoting these theories, but no significant evidence of them has ever surfaced, and it was disregarded as a hypothesis by the investigations in Canada and Switzerland. Other conspiracies linked the OTS to famous people and events. None of these claims were substantiated by the investigation. In one example of this, David Cohen, in his 2004 book &quot;&quot; attempted to link the OTS to both Princess of Monaco Grace Kelly and then-Prince Charles. The theory was sourced from a well known Swiss fraudster and does not match up with known facts about the OTS.

Several books have been published about the case. Several former members of the OTS wrote memoirs, including Tabachnik and Thierry Huguenin. Many journalists authored books on the OTS, including Arnaud Bédat, Gilles Bouleau and Bernard Nicolas, who authored &quot;Les Chevaliers de la mort&quot;. It has also been the subject of works from academics, including &quot;The Order of the Solar Temple: The Temple of Death&quot; and &quot;Les Mythes du Temple Solaire&quot;.

<text>Propylene glycol (IUPAC name: propane-1,2-diol) is a viscous, colorless liquid. It is almost odorless and has a faintly sweet taste. Its chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)CH2OH. 
As it contains two alcohol groups, it is classified as a diol. An aliphatic diol may also be called a glycol. It is miscible with a broad range of solvents, including water, acetone, and chloroform. In general, glycols are non-irritating and have very low volatility.

For certain uses as a food additive, propylene glycol is considered as GRAS by the US Food and Drug Administration, and is approved for food manufacturing. In the European Union, it has E-number E1520 for food applications. For cosmetics and pharmacology, the number is E490. Propylene glycol is also present in propylene glycol alginate, which is known as E405.

Propylene glycol is approved and used as a vehicle for topical, oral, and some intravenous pharmaceutical preparations in the US and Europe.

==Structure==
The compound is sometimes called (alpha) α-propylene glycol to distinguish it from the isomer propane-1,3-diol, known as (beta) β-propylene glycol. Propylene glycol is chiral. Commercial processes typically use the racemate. The S-isomer is produced by biotechnological routes.

==Production==
===Industrial===
Industrially, propylene glycol is mainly produced from propylene oxide (for food-grade use). According to a 2018 source, 2.16 M tonnes are produced annually. Manufacturers use either non-catalytic high-temperature process at to , or a catalytic method, which proceeds at to in the presence of ion exchange resin or a small amount of sulfuric acid or alkali.

Final products contain 20% propylene glycol, 1.5% of dipropylene glycol, and small amounts of other polypropylene glycols. Further purification produces finished industrial grade or USP/JP/EP/BP grade propylene glycol that is typically 99.5% or greater. Use of USP (US Pharmacopoeia) propylene glycol can reduce the risk of Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) rejection.

Propylene glycol can also be obtained from glycerol, a byproduct from the production of biodiesel. This starting material is usually reserved for industrial use because of the noticeable odor and taste that accompanies the final product.

===Laboratory===
(S)-Propanediol is synthesized via fermentation methods. Lactic acid and lactaldehyde are common intermediates. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate, one of the two products of breakdown (glycolysis) of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, is a precursor to methylglyoxal. This conversion is the basis of a potential biotechnological route to the commodity chemical 1,2-propanediol. Three-carbon deoxysugars are also precursor to the 1,2-diol.

A small-scale, nonbiological route from -mannitol is illustrated in the following scheme:

==Applications==

===Polymers===
Forty-five percent of propylene glycol produced is used as a chemical feedstock for the production of unsaturated polyester resins. In this regard, propylene glycol reacts with a mixture of unsaturated maleic anhydride and isophthalic acid to give a copolymer. This partially unsaturated polymer undergoes further crosslinking to yield thermoset plastics. Related to this application, propylene glycol reacts with propylene oxide to give oligomers and polymers that are used to produce polyurethanes. Propylene glycol is used in water-based acrylic architectural paints to extend dry time which it accomplishes by preventing the surface from drying due to its slower evaporation rate compared to water.

===Food and drug===
In regulated amounts, propylene glycol is designated as safe for food manufacturing as an anticaking agent, emulsifier, flavor agent, humectant, texturizer, stabilizer, solvent, antioxidant, antimicrobial agent, and thickener. 

As regulated by the US FDA for substances deemed as GRAS, propylene glycol is &quot;not subject to premarket review and approval by FDA because it is generally recognized, by qualified experts, to be safe under the intended conditions of use.&quot; The scientific panel evaluating propylene glycol for food manufacturing defined its conclusion as: &quot;There is no evidence in the available information on [propylene glycol] that demonstrates, or suggests reasonable grounds to suspect, a hazard to the public when they are used at levels that are now current or might reasonably be expected in the future.&quot; 

The FDA law defined maximum limits for the use of propylene glycol in various food categories under good manufacturing practices:

* 2.0% for general food categories
* 2.5% for frozen dairy products 
* 5% for alcoholic beverages
* 5% for nuts and nut products
* 24% for confections and frostings
* 97% for seasonings and flavorings

The European Food Safety Authority authorizes propylene glycol for use in food manufacturing, establishing a safe daily intake of 25 mg per kg of body weight. Specifically for ice cream or ice milk products, Health Canada permits use of propylene glycol mono fatty acid esters as an emulsifier and stabilizer at a maximum level of use of 0.35% of the ice cream made from the ingredients mix.

Propylene glycol is used in a variety of other edible items, such as baked goods, desserts, prepared meals, flavoring mixes, candy, popcorn, whipped dairy products, and soda. It is also used in beer to stabilize the foam. 

Vaporizers used for delivery of pharmaceuticals or personal-care products often include propylene glycol among the ingredients. In alcohol-based hand sanitizers, it is used as a humectant to prevent the skin from drying. Propylene glycol is used as a solvent in many pharmaceuticals, including oral, injectable, and topical formulations. Many pharmaceutical drugs which are insoluble in water utilize propylene glycol as a solvent and carrier; benzodiazepine tablets are one example. Propylene glycol is also used as a solvent and carrier for many pharmaceutical capsule preparations. Additionally, certain formulations of artificial tears use propylene glycol as an ingredient.

===Antifreeze===
The freezing point of water is depressed when mixed with propylene glycol. It is used as aircraft de-icing and anti-icing fluid. A 50% water-diluted and heated solution is used for removal of icing accretions from the fuselages of commercial aircraft on the ground (de-icing), and 100% undiluted cold solution is used only on wings and tail surfaces of an aircraft in order to prevent ice accretion from forming during a specific period of time before takeoff (anti-icing). Normally, such time-frame is limited to 15–90 minutes, depending on the severity of snowfall and outside air temperature. Water-propylene glycol mixtures dyed pink to indicate the mixture is relatively nontoxic are sold under the name of RV or marine antifreeze. Propylene glycol is frequently used as a substitute for ethylene glycol in low toxicity, environmentally friendly automotive antifreeze. It is also used to winterize the plumbing systems in vacant structures. The eutectic composition/temperature is 60:40 propylene glycol:water/−60 °C. The −50 °F/−45 °C commercial product is, however, water rich; a typical formulation is 40:60.

===Electronic cigarettes liquid===

Propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, or a mixture of both, are the main ingredients in e-liquid used in electronic cigarettes. They are aerosolized to resemble smoke and serve as carriers for substances such as nicotine and flavorants.

==Miscellaneous applications==
* As a solvent for many substances, both natural and synthetic.
* As a humectant (E1520).
* As a freezing point depressant for slurry ice.
* In veterinary medicine as an oral treatment for hyperketonaemia in ruminants.
* In the cosmetics industry, where propylene glycol is very commonly used as a carrier or base for various types of makeup.
* For trapping and preserving insects (including as a DNA preservative).
* For the creation of theatrical smoke and fog in special effects for film and live entertainment. So-called &#x27;smoke machines&#x27; or &#x27;hazers&#x27; vaporize a mixture of propylene glycol and water to create the illusion of smoke. While many of these machines use a propylene glycol-based fluid, some use oil. Those which use propylene glycol do so in a process that is identical to how electronic cigarettes work; utilizing a heating element to produce a dense vapor. The vapor produced by these machines has the aesthetic look and appeal of smoke, but without exposing performers and stage crew to the harms and odors associated with actual smoke.
* As an additive in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to reduce the melting temperature of nucleic acids for targeting of GC rich sequences.
* As a surfactant, it is used to prevent water from beading up on objects. It is used in photography for this purpose to reduce the risk of water spots, or deposits of minerals from water used to process film or paper.

==Safety in humans==

When used in average quantities, propylene glycol has no measurable effect on development and/or reproduction on animals and probably does not adversely affect human development or reproduction without active use. The safety of electronic cigarettes—which utilize propylene glycol-based preparations of nicotine or THC and other cannabinoids—is the subject of much controversy. Vitamin E acetate has also been identified in this controversy.

===Oral administration===
The acute oral toxicity of propylene glycol is very low, and large quantities are required to cause perceptible health effects in humans; in fact, the toxicity of propylene glycol is one third that of ethanol. Propylene glycol is metabolized in the human body into pyruvic acid (a normal part of the glucose-metabolism process, readily converted to energy), acetic acid (handled by ethanol-metabolism), lactic acid (a normal acid generally abundant during digestion), and propionaldehyde (a potentially hazardous substance). According to the Dow Chemical Company, the LD50 (dose that kills 50% of the test population) for rats is 20 g/kg (oral/rat).

Toxicity generally occurs at plasma concentrations over 4 g/L, which requires extremely high intake over a relatively short period of time, or when used as a vehicle for drugs or vitamins given intravenously or orally in large bolus doses. It would be nearly impossible to reach toxic levels by consuming foods or supplements, which contain at most 1 g/kg of PG, except for alcoholic beverages in the US which are allowed 5 percent = 50 g/kg. Cases of propylene glycol poisoning are usually related to either inappropriate intravenous administration or accidental ingestion of large quantities by children.

The potential for long-term oral toxicity is also low. In a National Toxicology Program continuous breeding study, no effects on fertility were observed in male or female mice that received propylene glycol in drinking water at doses up to 10100 mg/kg bw/day. No effects on fertility were seen in either the first or second generation of treated mice. In a 2-year study, 12 rats were provided with feed containing as much as 5% propylene glycol, and showed no apparent ill effects.

===Skin and eye contact===

Propylene glycol may be non-irritating to the skin, see section Allergic reaction below for details on allergic reactions. Undiluted propylene glycol is minimally irritating to the eye, producing slight transient conjunctivitis; the eye recovers after the exposure is removed.

A 2018 human volunteer study found that 10 male and female subjects undergoing 4 hours exposures to concentrations of up to 442 mg/m3 and 30 minutes exposures to concentrations of up to 871 mg/m3 in combination with moderate exercise did not show pulmonary function deficits, or signs of ocular irritation, with only slight symptoms of respiratory irritation reported.

Propylene glycol has not caused sensitization or carcinogenicity in laboratory animal studies, nor has it demonstrated genotoxic potential.

===Inhalation===
Inhalation of propylene glycol vapors appears to present no significant hazard in ordinary applications. Due to the lack of chronic inhalation data, it is recommended that propylene glycol not be used in inhalation applications such as theatrical productions, or antifreeze solutions for emergency eye wash stations. Recently, propylene glycol (commonly alongside glycerol) has been included as a carrier for nicotine and other additives in e-cigarette liquids, the use of which presents a novel form of exposure. The potential hazards of chronic inhalation of propylene glycol or the latter substance as a whole are as-yet unknown.

According to a 2010 study, the concentrations of PGEs (counted as the sum of propylene glycol and glycol ethers) in indoor air, particularly bedroom air, has been linked to increased risk of developing numerous respiratory and immune disorders in children, including asthma, hay fever, eczema, and allergies, with increased risk ranging from 50% to 180%. This concentration has been linked to use of water-based paints and water-based system cleansers. However, the study authors write that glycol ethers and not propylene glycol are the likely culprit.

===Intravenous administration===
Studies with intravenously administered propylene glycol have resulted in LD50 values in rats and rabbits of 7 mL/kg BW. Ruddick (1972) also summarized intramuscular LD50 data for rat as 13–20 mL/kg BW, and 6 mL/kg BW for the rabbit. Adverse effects to intravenous administration of drugs that use propylene glycol as an excipient have been seen in a number of people, particularly with large bolus dosages. Responses may include CNS depression, &quot;hypotension, bradycardia, QRS and T abnormalities on the ECG, arrhythmia, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, agitation, serum hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, and haemolysis&quot;. A high percentage (12–42%) of directly-injected propylene glycol is eliminated or secreted in urine unaltered depending on dosage, with the remainder appearing in its glucuronide-form. The speed of renal filtration decreases as dosage increases, which may be due to propylene glycol&#x27;s mild anesthetic / CNS-depressant properties as an alcohol. In one case, intravenous administration of propylene glycol-suspended nitroglycerin to an elderly man may have induced coma and acidosis. However, no confirmed lethality from propylene glycol was reported.

===Animals===
Propylene glycol is an approved food additive for dog and sugar glider food under the category of animal feed and is generally recognized as safe for dogs, with an LD50 of 9 mL/kg. The LD50 is higher for most laboratory animals (20 mL/kg). However, it is prohibited for use in food for cats due to links to Heinz body formation and a reduced lifespan of red blood cells. Heinz body formation from MPG has not been observed in dogs, cattle, or humans.

PG has been used in the dairy industry since the 1950s for cows showing signs of ketosis. The negative energy balance during the early stages of lactation can cause the animal&#x27;s body to have lower glucose levels, inducing the liver to make up for this by the conversion of body fat, leading to several health conditions, e.g. displaced abomasum. PG &quot;reduces the propionate ratio of acetate to acetaminophen, while increasing conversion of ruminal PG to propionate, and aid[s] in the closure of energy deficit in cattle.&quot;

===Allergic reaction===
Estimates on the prevalence of propylene glycol allergy range from 0.8% (10% propylene glycol in aqueous solution) to 3.5% (30% propylene glycol in aqueous solution). The North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) data from 1996 to 2006 showed that the most common site for propylene glycol contact dermatitis was the face (25.9%), followed by a generalized or scattered pattern (23.7%). Investigators believe that the incidence of allergic contact dermatitis to propylene glycol may be greater than 2% in patients with eczema or fungal infections, which are very common in countries with lesser sun exposure and lower-than-normal vitamin D balances. Therefore, propylene glycol allergy is more common in those countries.

Because of its potential for allergic reactions and frequent use across a variety of topical and systemic products, propylene glycol was named the American Contact Dermatitis Society&#x27;s Allergen of the Year for 2018. Recent publication from The Mayo Clinic reported 0.85% incidence of positive patch tests to propylene glycol (100/11,738 patients) with an overall irritant rate of 0.35% (41/11,738 patients) during a 20-year period of 1997–2016. 87% of the reactions were classified as weak and 9% as strong. The positive reaction rates were 0%, 0.26%, and 1.86% for 5%, 10%, and 20% propylene glycol respectively, increasing with each concentration increase. The irritant reaction rates were 0.95%, 0.24%, and 0.5% for 5%, 10%, and 20% propylene glycol, respectively. Propylene glycol skin sensitization occurred in patients sensitive to a number of other concomitant positive allergens, most common of which were: Myroxylon pereirae resin, benzalkonium chloride, carba mix, potassium dichromate, neomycin sulfate; for positive propylene glycol reactions, the overall median of 5 and mean of 5.6 concomitant positive allergens was reported.

==Environmental impacts==
Propylene glycol occurs naturally, probably as the result of anaerobic catabolism of sugars in the human gut. It is degraded by vitamin B12-dependent enzymes, which convert it to propionaldehyde.

Propylene glycol is expected to degrade rapidly in water from biological processes, but is not expected to be significantly influenced by hydrolysis, oxidation, volatilization, bioconcentration, or adsorption to sediment. Propylene glycol is readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions in freshwater, in seawater and in soil. Therefore, propylene glycol is considered as not persistent in the environment.

Propylene glycol exhibits a low degree of toxicity toward aquatic organisms. Several guideline studies available for freshwater fish with the lowest observed lethal concentration of 96-h LC50 value of 40,613 mg/L in a study with &quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;. Similarly, the lethal concentration determined in marine fish is a 96-h LC50 of &gt;10,000 mg/L in &quot;Scophthalmus maximus&quot;.

Although propylene glycol has low toxicity, it exerts high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) during degradation in surface waters. This process can adversely affect aquatic life by consuming oxygen needed by aquatic organisms for survival. Large quantities of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column are consumed when microbial populations decompose propylene glycol.

<text>The Pacific geoduck ( ; &quot;Panopea generosa&quot;) is a species of very large saltwater clam in the family Hiatellidae. The common name is derived from the Lushootseed name, .

The geoduck is native to the coastal waters of the eastern North Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Baja California. The shell of the clam ranges from to over in length, but the extremely long siphons make the clam itself much longer than this: the &quot;shaft&quot; or siphons alone can be in length. The geoduck is the largest burrowing clam in the world. It is also one of the longest-living animals of any type, with a typical lifespan of 140 years; the oldest has been recorded at 179 years old. The precise longevity of geoducks can be determined from annual rings deposited in the shell which can be assigned to calendar years of formation through crossdating. These annual rings also serve as an archive of past marine variability.
==Etymology==
The name &quot;Geoduck&quot; is derived from the Lushootseed name for the animal, . The etymology of is disputed. The lexical suffix means &quot;many&quot; in Lushootseed. The Oxford English Dictionary claims it is composed of a root word of unknown meaning and instead meaning &quot;genitals&quot; (referring to the shape of the clam), while other researchers claim it is a phrase meaning &quot;dig deep&quot;.

It is sometimes known as a &quot;mud duck&quot;, &quot;king clam&quot; or, when translated literally from Chinese, an &quot;elephant-trunk clam&quot; ().

Between 1983 and 2010, the scientific name of this clam was confused with that of an extinct clam, &quot;Panopea abrupta&quot; (Conrad, 1849), in scientific literature.

==Biology==
Native to the west coast of Canada and the northwest coast of the United States (primarily Washington and British Columbia), these marine bivalve mollusks are the largest burrowing clams in the world, weighing in at an average of at maturity, but specimens weighing over and as much as in length are not unheard of.

A related species, &quot;Panopea zelandica&quot;, is found in New Zealand and has been harvested commercially since 1989. The largest quantities have come from Golden Bay in the South Island where were harvested in one year. There is a growing concern over the increase of parasites in the Puget Sound population of geoduck. Whether these microsporidium-like parasitic species were introduced by commercial farming is being studied by Sea Grant. Research to date does indicate their presence.

The oldest recorded specimen was 179 years old, but individuals usually live up to 140 years. A geoduck sucks water containing plankton down through its long siphon, filters this for food and ejects its refuse out through a separate hole in the siphon. Adult geoducks have few natural predators, which may also contribute to their longevity. In Alaska, sea otters and dogfish have proved capable of dislodging geoducks; starfish also attack and feed on the exposed geoduck siphon.

Geoducks are broadcast spawners. A female geoduck produces about 5 billion eggs in her century-long lifespan. However, due to a low rate of recruitment and a high rate of mortality for geoduck eggs, larvae, and post-settled juveniles, populations are slow to rebound. In the Puget Sound, studies indicate that the recovery time for a harvested tract is 39 years.

Biomass densities in Southeast Alaska are estimated by divers, then inflated by twenty percent to account for geoducks not visible at the time of survey. This estimate is used to predict the two percent allowed for commercial harvesting.

==Industry==

The world&#x27;s first geoduck fishery was created in 1970, but demand for the half-forgotten clam was low at first due to its texture. , these clams sell in China for over US.

The geoduck&#x27;s high market value has created an $80-million industry, with harvesting occurring in the US states of Alaska, Washington, and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is one of the most closely regulated fisheries in both countries. In Washington, Department of Natural Resources staff are on the water continually monitoring harvests to ensure revenues are received, and the same is true in Canada where the Underwater Harvesters&#x27; Association manages the Canadian Fishery in conjunction with Canada&#x27;s Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The Washington State Department of Health tests water and flesh to assure clams are not filtering and holding pollutants, an ongoing problem. With the rise in price has come the inevitable problem with poaching, and with it the possibility some could be harvested from unsafe areas.

, advances in the testing system for contaminated clams have allowed geoduck harvesters to deliver live clams more consistently. The new testing system determines the viability of clams from tested beds before the harvesters fish the area. Previous methods tested clams after harvest. This advancement has meant that 90 percent of clams were delivered live to market in 2007. In 2001, only 10 percent were live. Because geoduck have a much higher market value live, an additional , this development has helped to stimulate the burgeoning industry.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the geoduck industry. Given the near-shutdown of restaurants and seafood markets across the country, demand for live geoducks plummeted. Divers in Southeast Alaska who typically see prices of for live geoducks reported prices as low as , leading many to stop fishing temporarily.

===Environmental impact===
Geoduck farming grow-out and harvest practices are controversial, and have created conflicts with shoreline property owners, and concerns from nongovernmental organizations. However, the Environmental Defense Fund has found that bivalves (oysters, mussels, and clams) are beneficial to the marine environment. The water must be certifiably clean to plant geoducks commercially. Regulation was mandated in 2007. Studies have been funded to determine short- and long-term environmental and genetic impacts. In southern Puget Sound, the effect of geoduck farming on large mobile animals is ambiguous. A 2004 draft biological assessment, commissioned by three of the largest commercial shellfish companies in the Puget Sound region, identified no long-term effects of geoduck farming on threatened or endangered species.

==Culinary uses==
The large, meaty siphon is prized for its savory flavor and crunchy texture. Geoduck is regarded by some as an aphrodisiac because of its phallic shape. It is very popular in China, where it is considered a delicacy, mostly eaten cooked in a fondue-style Chinese hot pot. In Korean cuisine, geoducks are eaten raw with spicy chili sauce, sautéed, or in soups and stews. In Japan, geoduck is prepared as raw sashimi, dipped in soy sauce and wasabi. On Japanese menus in cheaper sushi restaurants, geoduck is sometimes substituted for &quot;Tresus keenae&quot;, a species of horse clam, and labeled or . It is considered to have a texture similar to an ark shell (known in Japanese as ). is sometimes translated into English as &quot;giant clam&quot;, and it is distinguished from sushi, which is made from &quot;Tridacna gigas&quot;.

==In popular culture== 
Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, has a geoduck as its mascot named Speedy.

Geoducks have also earned some internet infamy due to the phallic appearance of their siphons.

<text>The Battle of New Market was fought on May 15, 1864, in Virginia during the Valley Campaigns of 1864 in the American Civil War. A makeshift Confederate army of 4,100 men defeated the larger Army of the Shenandoah under Major General Franz Sigel, delaying the capture of Staunton by several weeks. 

The battle is primarily remembered today for being the only time in American history a school&#x27;s student body was used as an organized combat unit. During the battle Confederate general John C. Breckinridge ordered cadets from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), some of them child soldiers no older than 15, to join an attack on the Union lines. The event has gone on to become central to many of the institute&#x27;s myths and traditions.

==Background==
In the spring of 1864, Union commander-in-chief Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant set in motion a grand strategy designed to press the Confederacy into submission. Control of the strategically important and agriculturally rich Shenandoah Valley was a key element in Grant&#x27;s plans. While he confronted General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia in the eastern part of the state, Grant ordered Major General Franz Sigel&#x27;s army of 10,000 to secure the valley and threaten Lee&#x27;s flank, starting the Valley Campaigns of 1864. 

Sigel was to advance on Staunton, Virginia, in order to link up with another Union column, commanded by George Crook, which would advance from West Virginia and destroy the Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroad and other Confederate industries in the area. Sigel&#x27;s force totaled about 9,000 men and 28 cannons, divided into an infantry division commanded by Brigadier General Jeremiah C. Sullivan and a cavalry division commanded by Major General Julius Stahel (detachments made during the campaign reduced the Union force to about 6,300 by the time of the battle).

Receiving word that the Union Army had entered the valley, Major General John C. Breckinridge pulled together all available forces to repulse the latest threat. His command consisted of two infantry brigades under John C. Echols and General Gabriel C. Wharton, a cavalry brigade commanded by General John D. Imboden, and other independent commands. This included the cadet corps of VMI, which had an infantry battalion of 247 cadets commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Scott Shipp and a two-gun artillery section. Breckinridge concentrated his infantry at Staunton, while Imboden slowed Sigel&#x27;s movement southward along the valley. 

On the morning of May 13, Breckinridge decided to move north to attack Sigel instead of waiting for Sigel to reach Staunton. By the evening of May 14, Sigel&#x27;s advance forces had reached a position north of the village of New Market, while Breckinridge was at Lacey Spring eight miles south of New Market. The Confederates started toward the Union positions at 1:00 a.m. on May 15, hoping to trap and crush the Union army.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===
===Confederate===
==Battle==
On May 14 a delaying action was fought at Rude&#x27;s Hill, just outside of Mt. Jackson, by elements of the Confederate 18th Virginia Cavalry, under the overall command of Colonel John Imboden. The Confederate cavalry slowed the Union advance, enabling Breckinridge to gather the main body of his Confederate forces at New Market, about 4 miles away. 

The two forces made contact south of New Market about mid-morning, with the main Union line west of the town near the North Fork of the Shenandoah River; Colonel Augustus Moor initially commanded the Union forces present on the battlefield at this time, which consisted of his infantry brigade and part of John E. Wynkoop&#x27;s cavalry brigade. Additional Union regiments arrived throughout the morning and deployed between the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and the Valley Turnpike, with the main line centered on Manor&#x27;s Hill. Breckinridge deployed Wharton&#x27;s brigade on the Confederate left west of the Valley Turnpike and Echols&#x27;s brigade on the right along the Pike; Echols was ill that morning, so his brigade was commanded by Colonel George S. Patton, Sr. The VMI cadets battalion was kept in reserve, while Imboden&#x27;s cavalry was east of the turnpike. 

Breckinridge attempted to lure the Federals into attacking him using cavalry and artillery, but Moor refused to move from his position. At about 11:00 a.m., Breckinridge decided to launch an attack on Moor using his infantry, while Imboden&#x27;s brigade crossed Smith&#x27;s Creek east of New Market, rode north, and recrossed the stream behind the Union lines. Union cavalry general Stahel arrived at New Market at this time with additional troops, followed shortly afterwards by Union general Sigel.

Breckinridge launched his infantry attack near noon, slowly pushing Moor&#x27;s infantry brigade off Manor&#x27;s Hill and northward toward the rest of Sigel&#x27;s army, which was deploying on a hill north of Jacob Bushong&#x27;s farm, known as Bushong&#x27;s Hill. Once past the town of New Market, the Confederates halted to dress ranks, shift units along the line, and reposition their artillery units. Breckinridge resumed his attack at about 2:00 p.m. As the Confederate line formed near the Bushong farm, massed Union rifle and artillery fire disorganized the Confederate units in the center, forcing the right wing of the 51st Virginia Infantry and the 30th Virginia Infantry Battalion to retreat in confusion, while the rest of the Confederate line stalled. 

Breckinridge reluctantly ordered the VMI cadet battalion to fill the gap; while the battalion was moving forward to the Bushong orchard, Shipp was wounded and was replaced by Captain Henry A. Wise. At this time, Sigel launched two counterattacks. On the Union left, Stahel launched a mounted charge with the cavalry but was routed by heavy fire from Confederate artillery, while three infantry regiments attacked on the Union right and were repulsed as well. The main cause of the failure of the infantry attacks was confusion within the ranks of the Union commanders; Sigel was noted to be shouting orders in his native language of German.

After the repulses of the Union attacks, Breckinridge started his advance again shortly after 3:00 p.m. with his infantry force; while crossing a field near Bushong&#x27;s orchard, several VMI cadets lost their shoes in the mud, which led to the field being called the &quot;Field of Lost Shoes&quot;. As the Confederate line got closer to the Union artillery, Sigel&#x27;s batteries were forced to retreat as the infantry started breaking towards the rear. Five cannons were abandoned to the Confederates, one of which was captured by the VMI cadet battalion. Battery B of the 5th U.S. Artillery, which had just arrived on the field, and two infantry regiments slowed the Confederate pursuit. At this time, Breckinridge halted his forces until the supply trains arrived to resupply the troops. While the infantry was being resupplied, Confederate cavalry general Imboden arrived with his brigade with the news that the creek was too swollen to be crossed. Union general Sullivan arrived during this time with the 28th and 116th Ohio infantry; Sigel managed to organize a rearguard on Rude&#x27;s Hill, with Sullivan&#x27;s infantry east of the turnpike, some of Stahel&#x27;s cavalry west of the road, and the artillery behind the line. Due to the exhaustion of the men and low ammunition, Sigel decided to retreat across the Shenandoah River to Mount Jackson. Breckinridge advanced his artillery to the crest of Rude&#x27;s Hill where they shelled Sigel&#x27;s retreating Federals. The Union army managed to cross Mill Creek at Mt. Jackson and burned the bridge before the Confederates could catch up.

==Aftermath==
Union casualties totaled 841 for the battle: 96 killed, 520 wounded, and 225 captured or missing, a casualty rate of 13.4%. The Confederates lost 43 killed, 474 wounded, and 3 missing, 13% of the army. The wounded from the battle were cared for in Bushong&#x27;s barn and in the town at the Smith Creek Baptist church and a warehouse, while the dead were buried in the graveyard of St. Matthew&#x27;s Lutheran Church. 

Sigel staged a rapid retreat northward to Strasburg, leaving the field and the Valley to Breckinridge&#x27;s army. After learning of the Union defeat, Grant became furious and replaced Sigel with General David Hunter; Sigel was assigned to command the department&#x27;s reserve division based in Harpers Ferry. Sergeant James Burns of the 1st West Virginia Infantry received the Medal of Honor in 1896 for saving the regimental flag in the battle.

The Confederate victory allowed the local crops to be harvested for Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia and protected Lee&#x27;s lines of communications to western Virginia. The Virginia newspapers and the Confederate soldiers in the battle compared Breckinridge to Stonewall Jackson. Following Sigel&#x27;s retreat, Lee suggested that Breckinridge follow the Union army and invade Maryland; however, the flooded rivers in the northern Shenandoah Valley and the length of his supply line prevented Breckinridge from making a pursuit. Breckinridge&#x27;s forces were transferred to eastern Virginia, where they reinforced Lee&#x27;s army at the Battle of Cold Harbor.

The victory failed to stop the Union offensive, however. After assuming command of the Army of the Shenandoah, Hunter resumed the march southwest and defeated a Confederate force under Brig. Gen. William E. &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones at the Battle of Piedmont on June 5, occupying Staunton the following day.

=== VMI casualties ===

Of the 247 VMI cadets at the battle, there were 60 casualties (around 24%), with five cadets killed in action, five more dying later of wounds received, and 50 others wounded in action but surviving. Eight VMI staff also accompanied the cadets and the Commandant, Scott Shipp, was wounded in action as well.

The New Market Day ceremony is an annual observance held at VMI in front of the monument &quot;Virginia Mourning Her Dead&quot;, a memorial to the New Market Corps. It was sculpted by Cavaliere Moses Ritter von Ezekiel, VMI Class of 1866, who was a veteran of the battle. The names of all of the cadets in the Corps of 1864 are inscribed on the monument, and six of the ten cadets who died are buried at this site. 

The ceremony features the roll call of the names of the cadets who lost their lives at New Market, a custom that began in 1887. As the name of each cadet who died is called, a representative from the same company in the modern Corps answers, &quot;Died on the Field of Honor, Sir.&quot; A 3-volley salute is conducted by a cadet honor guard, followed by &quot;Taps&quot; played over the parade ground. To culminate this ceremony, the entire Corps passes &quot;Virginia Mourning Her Dead&quot; in review.

==Battlefield preservation==
The battlefield is primarily preserved in the 300-acre New Market Battlefield State Historical Park. In addition, the Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.

==In popular culture==
In fall 1923, under the direction of Marine Corps Brigadier General Smedley Butler and employing the Quantico marines, the battle was reenacted on its historical grounds. The number of spectators was estimated at over 150,000.

John Ford&#x27;s 1959 film &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot; includes a scene which is loosely based on the event.

A principal character in Elaine Marie Alphin&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Ghost Cadet&quot; is the ghost of VMI cadet William Hugh McDowell, who was killed in the battle.

Sean McNamara&#x27;s 2014 film, &quot;Field of Lost Shoes&quot;, is a fictionalized account of the actions performed by VMI cadets during the battle. The movie follows a group of seven VMI cadets, based on real characters.
