<text>U.S. Route 10 or U.S. Highway 10 (US 10) is an east–west United States Numbered Highway located in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions of the U.S. Despite the &quot;0&quot; as the last digit in the number, US 10 is no longer a cross-country highway, and it never was a full coast-to-coast route. US 10 was one of the original long-haul highways, running from Detroit, Michigan, to Seattle, Washington, but then lost much of its length when new Interstate Highways were built on top of its right-of-way.

US 10 used to be broken into two segments by Lake Michigan. In 2015, the ferry between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin, was officially designated as part of the highway. The ferry operates only between May and October.

The eastern terminus of US 10 is in Bay City, Michigan, at its interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75) (near US 10&#x27;s milepost 139 and I-75&#x27;s milepost 162). The western terminus of US 10 is in the city of West Fargo, North Dakota, at its interchange with I-94.

===North Dakota===

In the state of North Dakota, US 10 runs for about , from I-94/US 52 at exit 343 to the Red River of the North. It is one of the primary east–west streets in West Fargo and Fargo and is called Main Avenue for its entire length in North Dakota. At the Red River, US 10 crosses over a bridge to Moorhead, Minnesota.

===Minnesota===

US 10 is a major divided highway for almost all of its length in Minnesota. The road enters Minnesota in Moorhead and travels through Detroit Lakes, Wadena, Staples, Little Falls, St. Cloud, and Elk River. It becomes a freeway in Anoka and passes through the northern suburbs of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, It enters Saint Paul paired with I-35E and exits Saint Paul paired with US 61. It leaves US 61 just north of Hastings as a two-lane highway shortly before entering into Wisconsin.

===Wisconsin===

US 10 enters Wisconsin at Prescott and travels southeastward passing Durand, Neillsville, Marshfield, Stevens Point, and Appleton before reaching its eastern terminus near the Lake Michigan shore in Manitowoc. Ferry service between the western and eastern portions of US 10 is provided between May and October by the ferry . US 10 is now a four-lane divided highway from State Trunk Highway 80 (WIS 80) south of Marshfield to I-39. This allows travelers to bypass Hewitt, Auburndale, Blenker, Milladore, Junction City, and downtown Stevens Point. This completes the plan to upgrade US 10 to a freeway or expressway status from Marshfield to Menasha. US 10 is an expressway between Stevens Point and Waupaca. It has been upgraded to a freeway in the Waupaca area and is also a freeway between Fremont and Appleton.

===Michigan===

The western terminus of US 10 in Michigan is Ludington. US 10 runs concurrently with US 31 from the east side of Ludington to Scottville before US 31 turns northward. The road then heads easterly through Baldwin and Reed City before it becomes a freeway west of US 127 near the junction with highway M-115. US 127 and US 10 overlap for a short distance near Clare. US 10 bypasses Midland and terminates at I-75 in Bay City.

==History==


Originally, US 10 also passed through Montana (including a segment of what is now Montana Highway 2 [MT 2]), the Idaho Panhandle, and Washington, terminating in Seattle. The completion of I-90 and I-94 replaced US 10 along this route, although some sections of the old US 10 road still exist in such cities as Bismarck, Missoula, Spokane, and between Cle Elum and Ellensburg as State Route 10 (SR 10). The last section of I-90 to be completed was between Coeur d&#x27;Alene and Wallace in the early 1990s. Much of this route was conumbered as both I-90 and US 10 until the final completion of I-90 through Idaho. Some decommissioned sections of US 10 are designated I-90 Business (I-90 Bus.) or I-94 Bus. routes. At least two US 10 Alternate (US 10 Alt.) routes were used, including one from Spokane to Missoula from 1941 to 1967 via Sandpoint, Idaho (represented today by US 2, State Highway 200, MT 200 and US 93), and the Pintler Scenic Route through Philipsburg, and Anaconda, renamed MT 1 when US 10 split between Garrison and Three Forks into US 10N and US 10S from 1936 until 1960. US 10N through Helena and dropping into Three Forks, while the Southern section of the split followed US 10&#x27;s traditional routing through Deer Lodge and Butte, Montana, to get across the Rocky Mountains. Previous to the split, US 10N was designated as another US 10 Alt.

At the eastern end, US 10 originally went south from Midland to Saginaw, Michigan, on what is now highway M-47. It then joined up with US 23 in Saginaw and continued south until it split from US 23 near Flint. It then continued southeast as the Dixie Highway to Pontiac, where it followed Woodward Avenue, now designated M-1. From there, US 10 continued on an almost straight line to Downtown Detroit, where it intersected US 16, US 25, and US 12. It then took a two-block jog and then ended at the Detroit–Windsor tunnel to Canada.

In the 1970s, US 10 was rerouted off Woodward Avenue in Metro Detroit and onto the John C. Lodge Freeway (formerly Business Spur 696, now M-10) and Telegraph Road. US 10 was truncated to Bay City, Michigan, in 1986 at which point the Lodge Freeway was changed to M-10.

In 1925, US 10 was originally proposed to run from Detroit through Chicago, and northwesterly into Wisconsin on what later became US 12.

In 2015, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials officially designated the car ferry as part of the highway&#x27;s official route, joining US 9 as the only two routes with a ferry connection.

US 10 has had alternate routes designated in the past, but none are active as of 2017. A multistate alternate route between Washington and Montana was largely replaced in 1947 by the western extension of US 2 and later decommissioned entirely in 1967.

Between 1926 and 1934, there was a pair of suffixed routes between St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Moorhead, Minnesota. US 10N, the northern half of the pairing, connected St. Cloud, Little Falls, Motley, and Detroit Lakes before reaching Moorhead. US 10S ran from St. Cloud through Alexandria and Fergus Falls before rejoining US 10N at Moorhead. In the mid-1930s, US 52 was extended into Minnesota, and US 10S was renamed to US 52 (now I-94). US 10N was renamed to US 10.

<text>is a 1965 Japanese &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film co-written, edited, and directed by Akira Kurosawa, in his last collaboration with actor Toshiro Mifune. Based on Shūgorō Yamamoto&#x27;s 1959 short story collection, &quot;Akahige Shinryōtan&quot;, the film takes place in Koishikawa, a district of Edo, towards the end of the Tokugawa period (i.e. early or mid-19th century), and is about the relationship between a town doctor and his new trainee. Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Humiliated and Insulted&quot; provided the source for a subplot about a young girl, Otoyo (Terumi Niki), who is rescued from a brothel.

The film looks at the problem of social injustice and explores two of Kurosawa&#x27;s favorite topics: humanism and existentialism. A few critics have noted the film to be reminiscent in some ways of &quot;Ikiru&quot;. It is Kurosawa&#x27;s last black-and-white film. The film was a major box office success in Japan but is known for having caused a rift between Mifune and Kurosawa, with this being the final collaboration between them after working on 16 films together. The film was screened in competition at the 26th Venice International Film Festival. Toshiro Mifune won a Volpi Cup for Best Actor for his performance in the film. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

==Plot==
The young and arrogant doctor Noboru Yasumoto, trained in a Dutch medical school in Nagasaki, aspires to the status of personal physician of the Shogunate, a position currently held by a close relative, and expects to progress through the privileged and insulated army structure of medical education. However, for Yasumoto&#x27;s post-graduate medical training, he is assigned to a rural clinic under the guidance of Dr. Kyojō Niide, known as &quot;Akahige&quot; (&quot;Red Beard&quot;). Beneath a gruff exterior, Dr. Niide is a compassionate and wise clinic director.

Yasumoto is initially livid at his posting, believing that he has little to gain from working under Dr. Niide. He assumes that Niide is only interested in seeing Yasumoto&#x27;s medical notes from Nagasaki, and he rebels against the clinic director. He refuses to see patients or to wear his uniform, disdains the food and spartan environment, and enters a forbidden garden where he meets &quot;The Mantis,&quot; a mysterious patient that only Dr. Niide can treat. Meanwhile, we learn that
Yasumoto&#x27;s former fiancée, Chigusa, was unfaithful to him, ending their engagement, and generating a disdain in him for romantic relationships.

As Yasumoto struggles to come to terms with his situation, the film tells the story of a few of the clinic&#x27;s patients. One of them is Rokusuke, a dying man whom Dr. Niide discerns is troubled by a secret misery that is only revealed when his desperately unhappy daughter shows up. Another is Sahachi, a well-loved man of the town known for his generosity to his neighbours, who has a tragic connection to his wife, whose corpse is discovered after a landslide. After committing bigamy, she had him unknowingly kill her by asking that he &quot;hold me closer&quot; while hugging, as she surreptitiously held a knife to herself. Dr. Niide brings Yasumoto along to rescue a sick twelve-year-old girl, Otoyo, from a brothel (brutally fighting off a local gang of thugs in the process) and then assigns the girl to Yasumoto as his first patient. Through these experiences, Yasumoto begins to humble himself and open his eyes to the world around him.

When Yasumoto himself falls ill, Dr. Niide asks Otoyo to nurse him back to health, knowing that caring for Yasumoto will also be part of her own continued healing. Chigusa&#x27;s younger sister, Masae, visits the clinic to check in on Yasumoto, telling him that his mother is sick and wants him to visit. Through his mother, Yasumoto learns that Chigusa now has a child with her new lover. Masae later makes a kimono for Otoyo and Yasumoto&#x27;s mother suggests he marry Masae.

Yasumoto begins to understand the magnitude of cruelty and suffering around him, as well as his power to ease that suffering, and learns to regret his vanity and selfishness.

Later, when a local boy, Chôbu, is caught stealing food from the clinic, Otoyo shows him compassion and befriends him, passing on the compassion she received from Niide and Yasumoto. When the brothel&#x27;s madam comes to the clinic to claim Otoyo and take her back to the brothel, the doctors and clinic staff refuse to let Otoyo go, and chase the madam away. When Chôbu and his destitute family try to escape their misery by taking poison together, the clinic doctors work to save them.

Yasumoto is offered the position of personal physician to the Shogunate he had so coveted. He agrees to marry Masae, but at the wedding announces that he will not accept the new position, but will stay at the clinic, turning down a comfortable and prestigious place in society to continue serving the poor alongside Dr. Niide. Surprised by his decision and advising him against it, Dr. Niide eventually gives in.

==Production==
===Writing===
After finishing &quot;High and Low&quot; (1963), director Akira Kurosawa accidentally picked up Shūgorō Yamamoto&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;Akahige Shinryōtan&quot;. Although he initially believed it would make a good script for fellow director Hiromichi Horikawa, Kurosawa became so interested in it as he wrote, that he knew he would have to direct it himself. Kurosawa completed writing the script for the film in early July 1963, which he co-wrote with screenwriters Masato Ide, Hideo Oguni, and Ryūzō Kikushima. Kurosawa noted that the script was quite different from the book, specifically mentioning how the young girl main character was not in Yamamoto&#x27;s novel. With this character, Kurosawa tried to show what Fyodor Dostoevsky showed using the character Nellie in &quot;Humiliated and Insulted&quot;.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on December 21, 1963, and wrapped up two years later. Kurosawa got sick twice during filming, while actors Toshiro Mifune and Yūzō Kayama fell ill once each. Mifune would never again work with Kurosawa because the director&#x27;s increasingly long production schedules required Mifune to turn down too many other TV and movie offers. The set was intended to be as realistic and historically accurate as possible. Film historian Donald Richie wrote that the main set was an entire town with back alleys and side streets, some of which were never even filmed. The materials used were actually about as old as they were supposed to be, with the tiled roofs taken from buildings more than a century old and all of the lumber taken from the oldest available farmhouses. Costumes and props were &quot;aged&quot; for months before being used; the bedding (made in Tokugawa-period patterns) was actually slept in for up to half a year before shooting. The wood used for the main gate was over a hundred years old, and after filming, it was re-erected at the entrance to the theater that hosted &quot;Red Beard&quot;″s premiere.

Richie wrote that one could argue that Kurosawa &quot;completely wasted his million yen set,&quot; as the main street is seen for only one minute (although its destruction was incorporated into the earthquake scene). Likewise, the scenes with the bridges and those in the elaborately constructed paddy are also rather brief. However, tourist bus companies did run tours through the set during the two years it took to make &quot;Red Beard&quot;.

According to Stephen Prince&#x27;s audio commentary on the Criterion Collection&#x27;s 2002 DVD, the film was shot at an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and was Kurosawa&#x27;s first film to use a magnetic 4-track stereo soundtrack.

==Release==
Toho was originally slated to release &quot;Red Beard&quot; during the New Year&#x27;s holiday season, but it was delayed, forcing producer Tomoyuki Tanaka to produce &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, instead. The film was eventually given a roadshow theatrical release in Japan by Toho on April 3, 1965, and was released throughout Japan on April 24, 1965. The film earned , with in distributor rental earnings, making it was one of the highest-grossing Japanese films of 1965. Toho International released the film to theaters in the United States with English subtitles in January 1966, and it was reissued by Frank Lee International in December 1968. In 1978, the film received a theatrical release in France, and sold 200,402 tickets during its theatrical run. The film was screened at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival in 2015.

In 1992, the film was released in the United States on LaserDisc by The Criterion Collection, and on VHS by Media Home Entertainment. The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD in the United States on July 16, 2002. Toho released the film on DVD in Japan on November 21, 2002 and reissued it on February 18, 2015. In 2003, BFI released &#x27;Red Beard&#x27; on a Region 2 DVD, with English subtitles. Their copy comes in a box with extensive sleeve notes. In 2014, Madman Entertainment distributed the film on DVD in Region 4.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
 The film has a score of 4.2/5 on Eiga.com, based on 41 reviews, with 56% of reviewers giving it a 5/5.

The film opened to highly positive reviews in Japan, with many calling it one of Kurosawa&#x27;s best films, and winning the Best Film award by the Japanese film magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;. However, the film received a mixed response from Western audiences; while it was a box-office success in Japan, it performed poor commercially abroad.

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars in a review dated December 26, 1969, writing &quot;Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Red Beard&quot; is assembled with the complexity and depth of a good 19th century novel, and it&#x27;s a pleasure, in a time of stylishly fragmented films, to watch a director taking the time to fully develop his characters.&quot; Michael Sragow of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote &quot;This 1965 film, the last of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s collaboration with Toshiro Mifune, is often derided as a soap opera. But the story of a grizzled nineteenth-century doctor nicknamed Red Beard (Mifune) and his green physician (Yuzo Kayama) who learns human medical values from him — is actually a masterpiece.&quot;

<doc id="235334" wikidata="Q247696" url="?curid=235334" title="Summoning (band)">
<text>Summoning is an Austrian atmospheric black metal band based in Vienna. Since their formation in 1993, they have released eight full-length albums and two EPs via Napalm Records. Their lyrics make extensive use of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth writings and mythology. Since 1995, their lineup has had a consistent lineup of Richard Lederer as &quot;Protector&quot; and Michael Gregor as &quot;Silenius&quot;. The band never played live performances and has consistently maintained that they have no interest in ever doing so. Their latest album &quot;With Doom We Come&quot; was released on 5 January 2018.

==History==
=== Early years (1993–1995) ===
Summoning was formed in 1993 by Silenius (Michael Gregor), Protector (Richard Lederer) and Trifixion (Alexander Trondl). Before forming Summoning, Protector was a drummer in a thrash/death metal band Marlignom and had embarked on a four-year study of drums in music school. At the age of 16, Silenius was in a doom metal band Shadow Vale and studied piano for a few years in music school. He also played in a band Cromm together with Pazuzu (Ray Wells). Trifixion was a member of Pervertum.

Summoning recorded two demos (&quot;Upon the Viking&#x27;s Stallion&quot; and &quot;Anno Mortiri Domini&quot;), as well as a split with the Austrian band Pazuzu (&quot;The Urilia Text&quot;) and a five-track promo tape for &quot;Lugburz&quot;. Nearly all of the demo songs were never released or were recomposed for future albums.

The demos sold quite well in a record shop in Vienna called &quot;Why not&quot;. Silenius got in contact with Thomas Tannenberger, eventually leading to the foundation of Abigor. Silenius ended up doing vocals for all Abigor releases (except the demos) as a permanent member until 1999. The first Abigor album was recorded for the Napalm Records label, which led to Silenius managing to get a deal with Napalm for Summoning&#x27;s debut &quot;Lugburz&quot; album in 1995. At that time the members of Summoning were: Silenius (vocals, keyboards, bass), Protector (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Trifixion (drums); Pazuzu did additional vocals and wrote some of the lyrics. It was Trifixion&#x27;s last release with Summoning. &quot;Lugburz&quot; was a traditional black metal, vastly different than the band&#x27;s future releases.

=== Active years (1995–2003) ===
The band continued as a duo after the departure of Trifixion, releasing &quot;Minas Morgul&quot; in 1995. This was the band&#x27;s first release set in an epic and atmospheric style utilizing guitar purely as a background instrument and synth almost as a lead, using re-recorded early songs. &quot;Dol Guldur&quot;, released in 1997, continued this style, influenced by Protector&#x27;s dark wave project Ice Ages. It also credits J.R.R. Tolkien for the lyrics. Later in 1997, the &quot;Nightshade Forests&quot; EP was released. Following this, the band ceased all work for nearly two years, and also stopped work with many of their other music projects. But in 1999, Summoning returned with &quot;Stronghold&quot;, which, while still in the classic Summoning style, focused more on guitar work to create melodic lines rather than keyboards and synthesizers like in previous releases.

In 2001, the follow-up &quot;Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame&quot; album was released. This release was a combination between the old and new style of Summoning, with the keyboard lines being more epic and polyphonic while the guitars bore a similarity with the more complex and rock-esque guitar-style featured on &quot;Stronghold&quot;. This time, the band used more spoken-word samples to bring a more dramatic style to the songs and for the first time the band worked with clear vocal choirs on the song &quot;Farewell&quot;. The lyrical concept again was totally based on Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, but for the first time it was combined with some inspiration from Michael Moorcock&#x27;s fantasy writings. In 2003, they released the &quot;Lost Tales&quot; EP, which consisted of leftovers from the &quot;Dol Guldur&quot; sessions.

=== &quot;Oath Bound&quot; and inactivity (2006–2011) ===
2006 saw the release of &quot;Oath Bound&quot;, which consisted of entirely new material. The five year long break between the releases of &quot;Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame&quot; and &quot;Oath Bound&quot; was due to struggles in the band members&#x27; personal lives, along with lack of ideas. &quot;Oath Bound&quot; featured a &quot;relaxed arpeggio style&quot; guitar sound, which gave a more epic feeling to the sound of the album. The band also had higher-quality equipment available to them for the recording of the album and were able to create greater choir vocals than they had done before. A 4-song mini CD was suggested for release in 2007 containing at least one song which did not make it onto &quot;Oath Bound&quot; due to size issues, however, this idea was abandoned and Protector instead began work on music for a full-length release while waiting for Silenius to finish recording the next Kreuzweg Ost album.

Following the release of &quot;Oath Bound&quot;, Summoning entered a period of inactivity. Silenius experienced a creative block and lacked inspiration for creating new music for Summoning. He also suffered a heart attack. In an interview for IsolationGrind, he is quoted saying: &quot;a heart-infarct knocked me out for another half a year, but somehow all this brought me to a point where I got hungry again and since then I concentrated again on making riffs. Everything started in small steps. but after a while I knew in which direction the music was going and the more I knew this, the easier it was to compose and the result is what you hear now.&quot;

=== &quot;Old Mornings Dawn&quot; (2012–2017) ===
In February 2012, the band announced on their website that they were in the process of writing new songs, and hoped to have most of the songs complete by the end of the year. In December 2012 it was announced that all the guitars and Protector&#x27;s vocal parts for the new album were complete and that the upcoming album would be entitled &quot;Old Mornings Dawn&quot;. The album was released in June 2013 via Napalm Records and lyrically focused mostly on nature themes, as well as J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Valinor.

In 2015 the band confirmed that they had already begun working on creating a new album, and were focused on rewriting some of the leftover material from &quot;Old Mornings Dawn&quot;.

On 15 December 2016, a compilation tribute album titled &quot;In Mordor Where The Shadows Are - Homage to Summoning&quot; was released by Wolfspell Records. The album features covers of 21 different Summoning songs by artists such as Caladan Brood and Emyn Muil.

=== &quot;With Doom We Come&quot; (2018) ===
On 12 August 2017, Summoning posted an update on their official Facebook page noting that despite troubles, setbacks and disputes, the band&#x27;s new album will be released in January 2018 by Napalm Records. The band posted a teaser of the new music, although they did not disclose the name of the forthcoming album.

On 1 October 2017, Summoning posted an update on their Facebook page announcing the title of the album as &quot;With Doom We Come&quot;. The album was subsequently released on 5 January 2018.

==Musical style and influences==
The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Lugburz&quot; was a traditional black metal album, with a raw, lo-fi production style. On their following album &quot;Minas Morgul&quot; the band&#x27;s sound changed significantly, and has been characterised as &quot;a departure from straight black metal in favor of bold atmospheric experimentation which retains a definite blackened feel.&quot; The band&#x27;s sound has remained relatively consistent since then. It was frequently described as &quot;epic&quot;, &quot;hypnotic&quot;, and &quot;atmospheric&quot;, and makes extensive use of keyboards, choir vocals, clean singing, synthesized instruments, and programmed drums. Though the drums are programmed, they are played using a keyboard rather than with a drum machine. Their sound has been described as &quot;a particularly widescreen version of progressive black metal, a style that more recently has been infused with an almost medieval strain of twiddly folk music of the lutes &#x27;n&#x27; flutes variety.&quot; The band&#x27;s music is deeply influenced by the literature of J. R. R. Tolkien, particularly &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Most of the band&#x27;s lyrics are derived from Tolkien&#x27;s own works. Silenius claimed to be influenced by dark wave and ritualistic music as well as fantasy literature.

The band stated that they consider themselves to be composers rather than musicians and do not practice together before recording. Guitarist Protector does not own a guitar and has used a different borrowed guitar for every recording since &quot;Dol Guldur&quot;.

<doc id="235335" wikidata="Q1130127" url="?curid=235335" title="Facelift (album)">
<text>Facelift is the debut studio album by the American rock band Alice in Chains, released by Columbia Records on August 28, 1990. The tracks &quot;We Die Young&quot;, and &quot;Man in the Box&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Man in the Box&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal in 1992. &quot;Facelift&quot; became the first grunge album to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), achieving this feat on September 11, 1991. The album peaked at No. 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and has been certified triple-platinum by the RIAA for shipments of three million copies in the United States.

==Background and recording==
Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of Alice in Chains at a concert, and offered to pay for demo recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest marijuana raid in the state&#x27;s history. The final demo – dubbed &quot;The Treehouse Tapes&quot; – found its way to managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based Soundgarden. Curtis and Silver passed the demo to Columbia Records&#x27; A&amp;R representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Ienner. Based on &quot;The Treehouse Tapes&quot; (sold by the band at shows), Ienner signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989.

Alice in Chains became a top priority for the label, who released the band&#x27;s first official recording in July 1990: the promotional EP &quot;We Die Young&quot;. Its lead single and title song became a hit on metal radio. After its success, the label rushed Alice in Chains&#x27; debut album into production with producer Dave Jerden. &quot;I told Jerry Cantrell, ‘Metallica took Tony Iommi and sped him up. What you&#x27;ve done is you&#x27;ve slowed him down again,’&quot; Jerden recalled. &quot;He looked at me and said, ‘You got it.’ That&#x27;s how I got the gig.&quot;

Drummer Sean Kinney claims to have played this album with a broken hand:

&quot;Facelift&quot; was recorded at London Bridge Studio in Seattle and at Capitol Studios in Hollywood from December 1989 to April 1990. Footage from the &quot;Facelift&quot; sessions can be found on Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Music Bank: The Videos&quot; DVD.

==Music and lyrics==
Guitarist Jerry Cantrell stated the album was intended to have a &quot;moody aura&quot; that was a &quot;direct result of the brooding atmosphere and feel of Seattle.&quot; Regarding the music for &quot;Man in the Box&quot;, Cantrell said in the 1999 &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set, &quot;That whole beat and grind of that is when we started to find ourselves; it helped Alice become what it was.&quot; The idea of using a voice box in the song came from producer Dave Jerden, who was driving to the studio one day when Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot; started playing on the radio.

Cantrell also credited &quot;I Can&#x27;t Remember&quot; for helping the band find its sound. &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Like That&quot; came out of a riff that Cantrell cited as a mistake, however he called it &quot;a cool mistake.&quot;

Cantrell called &quot;Love, Hate, Love&quot; the &quot;masterpiece of that record,&quot; adding about the song that Staley&#x27;s vocals are &quot;amazing&quot; and that it features one of his favorite guitar solos he ever performed.

Regarding the lyrical content, Cantrell said he wrote &quot;We Die Young&quot; after &quot;riding the bus to rehearsal and [seeing] all these 9, 10, 11 year old kids with beepers dealing drugs. The sight of a 10 year old kid with a beeper and a cell phone dealing drugs equaled &quot;We Die Young&quot; to me.&quot; In a recorded interview with MuchMusic USA, vocalist Layne Staley stated that the lyrics for &quot;Man in the Box&quot; are about censorship in the mass media, and &quot;I was really stoned when I wrote it.&quot;

Discussing &quot;Bleed the Freak&quot;, Cantrell stated that the lyrics represent &quot;us against the world, those people who put you down.&quot;

Cantrell wrote &quot;Sunshine&quot; about his mother&#x27;s death. &quot;Facelift&quot; was dedicated to her memory.

Staley&#x27;s &quot;Sexual chocolate, baby!&quot; scream at the end of &quot;Real Thing&quot; was a reference to the film &quot;Coming to America&quot; starring Eddie Murphy, whose character was the singer of a band called Sexual Chocolate.

==Packaging and title==
In an interview with Video Metal Sheet in 1991, Jerry Cantrell said that the original idea for the album cover was &quot;an embryonic-type thing&quot; representing the birth of the band. But it ended up taking more of a scary overtone and fitting quite well with the music.

The band discussed several ideas for the album art with photographer Rocky Schenck. One of those ideas was making it appear as if they were emerging from an eyeball. Columbia Records did not give the band a large budget for the photoshoot, but Schenck liked them so much that he was willing to make it work. The budget was barely enough for a one-day shoot, but Schenck stretched it out for over three days. The first day of shoot took place on May 2, 1990, at the swimming pool of the Oakwood Apartments in Burbank, California. The pool was covered with a thin piece of plastic to give the idea that the band was emerging from an eyeball. They had to swim under the plastic, rise to the surface and breathe in as they emerged, so the plastic distorted their faces. One of the photos from that session included a shot of Layne Staley wrapped in plastic with the other members holding him, which was used as the cover for the &quot;We Die Young&quot; single.

Schenck was experimenting with in-camera multiple exposures, where he would create a distorted image by exposing different parts of a single frame of film one exposure at a time, a technique that he had been using for years in his videos and art photography. The band had seen Schenck&#x27;s portfolio of black and white portraits of haunted, distorted faces, and asked him to duplicate the technique. Schenck did not want to duplicate the original black and white photo, so he tried the same technique in color using photos of each band member&#x27;s face. A photo of bassist Mike Starr was chosen as the album cover. After seeing the photo, the band decided to name the album &quot;Facelift&quot;. The original concept for the cover was to have all four members&#x27; faces superimposed into one startling expression, which appeared years later in the &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Facelift&quot; was released on August 28, 1990, peaking at number 42 in the summer of 1991 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It was the first album from the grunge movement to reach the top 50 in America on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and the first to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on September 11, 1991, followed by Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; on November 27, 1991.

&quot;Facelift&quot; included the singles &quot;We Die Young&quot;, &quot;Man in the Box&quot;, and &quot;Sea of Sorrow&quot;, all of which had accompanying music videos. The album was a critical success, with &quot;Hollywood&quot; Steve Huey of AllMusic citing &quot;Facelift&quot; as &quot;one of the most important records in establishing an audience for grunge and alternative rock among hard rock and heavy metal listeners.&quot;

&quot;Facelift&quot; was not an instant success, selling under 40,000 copies in the first six months of release, until MTV added &quot;Man in the Box&quot; to regular daytime rotation.

&quot;Man in the Box&quot; hit number 18 on the Mainstream Rock charts, with the album&#x27;s follow up single, &quot;Sea of Sorrow&quot;, reaching number 27, and in six weeks &quot;Facelift&quot; sold 400,000 copies in the United States.

Alice in Chains was nominated for a Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal Grammy Award in 1992 for &quot;Man in the Box&quot;, but lost to Van Halen for their 1991 album &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot;. The music video for &quot;Man in the Box&quot; was nominated for Best Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Video at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. The album won Best Debut Album at the 1991 Foundations Forum.

In June 2017, Ozzy Osbourne listed &quot;Facelift&quot; as one of his &quot;10 Favorite Metal Albums&quot;.

In April 2019, the album was ranked No. 14 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot; list. Soundgarden lead guitarist Kim Thayil also picked &quot;Facelift&quot; as one of his favorite Grunge albums.

==Tour==
The band continued to hone its audience, opening for such artists as Iggy Pop, Van Halen, Poison, and Extreme. In early 1991, Alice in Chains landed the opening slot for the Clash of the Titans with Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer, exposing the band to a wide metal audience. During the tour the band found themselves subject to some hostile audiences; however, Anthrax bassist Frank Bello recalls them earning the respect of others by standing up for themselves: &quot;If there was a guy starting shit, Layne would jump into the audience and beat the FUCK outta that guy!&quot; Michael Christopher of &quot;PopMatters&quot; observed &quot;With 1990&#x27;s &quot;Facelift&quot;, before Nirvana blew the scene wide open, Seattle’s Alice in Chains were getting a metal push, thrown on tour with the likes of Slayer and Megadeth, repeatedly booed off stage in a genre where they didn’t belong.&quot; The band later released the video compilation &quot;Live Facelift&quot;, which was filmed at the Moore Theatre in 1990.

== Track listing ==
All music and lyrics written by Jerry Cantrell, except where noted.


==Outtakes and non-album tracks==
&quot;Killing Yourself&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Facelift&quot; sessions, was featured as the B-side to the 1990 &quot;We Die Young&quot; vinyl single. It has never been issued on CD.

Demos for the songs &quot;I Can&#x27;t Have You Blues&quot;, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;, &quot;Social Parasite&quot;, &quot;Bleed the Freak&quot;, &quot;Sea of Sorrow&quot;, and &quot;Killing Yourself&quot; were featured on Alice in Chains&#x27; 1988 demo tape. Remixes of these recordings were later included on the band&#x27;s 1999 box set, &quot;Music Bank&quot;. A demo of &quot;We Die Young&quot; from the same sessions was released exclusively on the 1999 &quot;Nothing Safe: Best of the Box&quot; compilation.

Further 1988 demos of the songs &quot;Chemical Addiction&quot;, &quot;Fairytale Love Story&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Rodeo&quot;, &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot;, &quot;King of the Kats&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Remember&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, and a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Suffragette City&quot; circulate on various bootlegs in poor quality. A live version of &quot;Queen of the Rodeo&quot; features on the 2000 live album &quot;Live&quot; as well as the &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set. Regarding the songs featured on the 1988 demo tape, Cantrell said, &quot;I guess with all those songs we were &#x27;discovering&#x27; ourselves.&quot;

<doc id="235338" wikidata="Q968988" url="?curid=235338" title="Heliozoa">
<text>Heliozoa, commonly known as sun-animalcules, are microbial eukaryotes (protists) with stiff arms (axopodia) radiating from their spherical bodies, which are responsible for their common name. The axopodia are microtubule-supported projections from the amoeboid cell body, and are variously used for capturing food, sensation, movement, and attachment. They are similar to Radiolaria, but they are distinguished from them by lacking central capsules and other complex skeletal elements, although some produce simple scales and spines. They may be found in both freshwater and marine environments.

==Classification==
Originally the heliozoa were treated together as a formal taxon Heliozoa or Heliozoea, with the rank of class or phylum, but it has been realised that they are polyphyletic, as the various orders show notable differences and are no longer believed to be descended from a single common ancestor. Instead, &quot;heliozoa&quot; is regarded as a descriptive term applying to various lines of protists.

The primary groups include:

* Actinophryida, Pedinellida and Ciliophryida (currently in Stramenopiles)
* Centrohelida (currentily in Haptista)
* Desmothoracida, Heliomonadida/Dimorphida and Gymnosphaerida (currently in Rhizaria &gt; Cercozoa)
* Taxopodida/&quot;Sticholonche&quot; (currently in Rhizaria &gt; Radiolaria)
* Rotosphaerida (currently in Opisthokonta &gt; Nucleariida and in Rhizaria)

Several nucleariids were once considered heliozoa, but they do not have microtubule-supported axopods and so are now considered filose amoeboids instead.

=== Phylogeny ===

The heliozoa are a polyphyletic grouping of various protists that have independently evolved axopodial arms. Some of the heliozoan groups are intermingled in the supergroup Rhizaria with radiolarians, their mostly marine counterpart.

<doc id="235340" wikidata="Q200499" url="?curid=235340" title="Zia-ul-Haq">
<text>Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (12 August 192417 August 1988) was a Pakistani dictator who controlled Pakistan from his 1977 coup until his death in 1988. He took over the country after leading a coup on 5 July 1977, which overthrew the democratically elected government of prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Zia subsequently imposed martial law, suspended the constitution, and served as chief martial law administrator before assuming the presidency and becoming a dictator. Zia served as the 2nd chief of the Army Staff from 1976 to 1988, a position he later leveraged to execute a coup in 1977, which was the second coup in Pakistan&#x27;s history of coups; the first occurred in 1958 under Ayub Khan.

Zia was born in Jalandhar and trained at the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun. In 1943, he was commissioned in the British Indian Army and fought in the Pacific War of the Second World War. Following the partition of India in 1947, Zia joined the Pakistan Army and was stationed in the Frontier Force Regiment. During Black September, he played a prominent role in defending the Jordanian Armed Forces against the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1976, Zia was elevated to the rank of General and was appointed as Chief of Army Staff, succeeding Tikka Khan, by prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
In July 1977, Zia organized Operation Fair Play, during which he overthrew Bhutto and declared martial law. Zia remained &quot;de facto&quot; leader for over a year, assuming the presidency in September 1978. He directed Islamization in Pakistan, escalated the country&#x27;s atomic bomb project and instituted industrialization and deregulation, which significantly improved Pakistan&#x27;s economy. In 1979, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Zia adopted an anti-Soviet stance and aided the Afghan mujahidin. He bolstered ties with China and the United States and emphasized Pakistan&#x27;s role in the Islamic world. Zia held non-partisan elections in 1985 and appointed Muhammad Junejo prime minister, though he accumulated more presidential powers through the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution of Pakistan. He dismissed Junejo&#x27;s government on charges of economic stagflation and announced general elections in November 1988. In August 1988, while travelling from Bahawalpur to Islamabad, Zia died in an aircraft crash near the Sutlej River. He was buried at the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad.

Zia dominated Pakistan&#x27;s politics for over a decade and his proxy war against the Soviet Union is credited with stopping an expected Soviet invasion of Pakistan. He is praised by right-wing conservatives for his desecularization efforts and opposition to Western culture. Zia&#x27;s detractors criticize his authoritarianism, his press censorship, his purported religious intolerance and his weakening of democracy in Pakistan. His overall policy has been called Ziaism. Zia is also cited for promoting the political career of Nawaz Sharif, who was thrice elected prime minister and current leader of PML-N.

== Early life and family ==
Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq was born on 12 August 1924 in Jalandhar, Punjab Province, British India. His father, Muhammad Akbar Ali, worked in the Army General Headquarters in Delhi. Ali was noted for his religiosity which earned him the Muslim clerical title molvi. His family belonged to the Arain community of Punjabis. At an early age, Zia and his six siblings were taught the Quran.

After completing his initial education in Simla, Zia attended Delhi&#x27;s prestigious St. Stephen&#x27;s College, an Anglican missionary school, for his BA degree in History, from which he graduated with distinction in 1943. He was admitted to the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun, graduating in May 1945 among the last group of officers to be commissioned before the independence of India.On 10 August 1950, he married his cousin Shafiq Jahan in Lahore. Begum Shafiq Zia died on 6 January 1996. Zia is survived by his sons, Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq, (born 1953), who went into politics and became a cabinet minister in the government of Nawaz Sharif, and Anwar-ul-Haq (born 1960) and his daughters, Zain (born 1972), a special needs child, Rubina Saleem, who is married to a Pakistani banker and has been living in the United States since 1980, and Quratulain Zia who currently lives in London, and is married to Pakistani doctor, Adnan Majid.

His cousin Mian Abdul Waheed has served as diplomat, being Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador to Germany and Italy, also playing a major role in the country becoming a nuclear power, while post-retirement he turned to active politics, long been associated with the PML-N before ending up in the PPP.

== Military service ==

=== Early career and partition ===
Zia was commissioned into the British Indian Army on 12 May 1943 after graduating from the Mhow Officer Training School. He was posted to the 13th Lancers, a cavalry unit accoutered with tanks. During the Second World War, in May 1945, Zia participated in the Burma campaign and the Malayan campaign of the Pacific War against the Imperial Japanese Army. 

Zia was also participated in Indonesian National Revolution, Including the Battle of Surabaya.

Following the partition of India in 1947, Captain Zia was the escort officer for the last train of refugees to leave Babina, an armored corps training center in Uttar Pradesh, a difficult journey that took seven days, during which the passengers were under constant fire as communal violence broke out in the aftermath of Partition.

In September 1950, Zia joined the Guides Cavalry. He was trained in the United States from 1962–1964 at the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. After that, he returned to take over as Directing Staff (DS) at Command and Staff College, Quetta. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Zia is said to have been the Assistant Quartermaster of the 101st Infantry Brigade.. In 1969 he raised the 9th Armoured Brigade in Kharian as the first Brigade Commander of the brigade, the brigade is currently stationed in Gujranwala under 6th Armoured Division (Pakistan).

As a young soldier, Zia preferred prayers when &quot;drinking, gambling, dancing and music were the way officers spent their free time.&quot;

===Role in Black September===

Brigadier Zia was stationed in Jordan from 1967 to 1970 as the head of a Pakistani training mission to Jordan. Zia-ul-Haq became involved on the Jordanian side of the military conflict against Palestinian insurgents known as Black September. Zia had been stationed in Amman for three years prior to Black September. During the events, according to CIA official Jack O&#x27;Connell, Zia was dispatched north by King Hussein to assess Syria&#x27;s military capabilities. The Pakistani commander reported back to Hussein, recommending the deployment of a RJAF squadron to the region. Zia-ul-Haq then went on to plan the Jordanian offensive against the Palestinians and commanded an armoured division against them. O&#x27;Connell also reported that Zia personally led Jordanian troops during battles.

According to the biography provided by Major-General A. O. Mitha, it was the Army Chief of General Staff, Lieutenant General Gul Hasan&#x27;s lobbying at the Army GHQ which also saved then Brigadier Zia-ul-Haq from being terminated. Brigadier Zia had been recommended to be court-martialled by Major-General Nawazish in his submission to President Yahya Khan for disobeying GHQ orders by commanding a Jordanian armoured division against the Palestinians, as part of actions during Black September in which thousands were killed. It was Gul Hasan who interceded for Zia after which Army Chief General Yahya Khan let Zia off the hook.

===Ascent to Chief of Army Staff===

He was then promoted as Lieutenant General and was appointed commander of the &quot;II Strike Corps&quot; at Multan in 1975. On 1 March 1976, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto approved then-three star rank general Lieutenant-General Zia as Chief of Army Staff and to be elevated to four-star rank.

At the time of his nominating the successor to the outgoing Chief of Army Staff General Tikka Khan, the Lieutenant Generals in order of seniority were: Muhammad Shariff, Akbar Khan, Aftab Ahmed, Azmat Baksh Awan, Ibrahim Akram, Abdul Majeed Malik, Ghulam Jilani Khan, and Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. But, Bhutto chose the most junior, superseding seven more senior lieutenant-generals. However, the senior most at that time, Lieutenant-General Mohammad Shariff, though promoted to General, was made the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, a constitutional post akin to President Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry.

Pakistani academic Husain Haqqani argues that Bhutto chose Zia ahead of many senior officers for ethnic and caste reasons, thinking that an Arain would not make an alliance with the predominantly Pashtun and Rajput military officers in order to overthrow him, and this is also the reason why he let Zia push for more Islam in the armed forces. Thus Bhutto let him change the army&#x27;s motto to and let him offer books of Mawdudi to his officers as prizes during various competitions, despite the strong ideological antagonism between Bhutto and Zia.

== Military coup ==

=== Pre-coup unrest ===
Prime Minister Bhutto began facing considerable criticism and increasing unpopularity as his term progressed; the democratic socialist&#x27;s alliance who had previously allied with Bhutto began to diminish as time progressed. Initially targeting leader of the opposition Vali Khan and his opposition National Awami Party (NAP), also a socialist party. Despite the ideological similarity of the two parties, the clash of egos both inside and outside the National Assembly became increasingly fierce, starting with the Federal government&#x27;s decision to oust the NAP provincial government in Balochistan Province for alleged secessionist activities and culminating in the banning of the party and arrest of much of its leadership after the death of a close lieutenant of Bhutto&#x27;s, Hayat Sherpao, in a bomb blast in the frontier town of Peshawar.

Dissidence also increased within the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), and the murder of leading dissident Ahmed Raza Kasuri&#x27;s father led to public outrage and intra-party hostility as Bhutto was accused of masterminding the crime. PPP leaders such as Ghulam Mustafa Khar openly condemned Bhutto and called for protests against his regime. The political crisis in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and Balochistan intensified as civil liberties remained suspended, and an estimated 100,000 troops deployed there were accused of abusing human rights and killing large numbers of civilians.

On 8 January 1977, a large number of opposition political parties grouped to form the Pakistan National Alliance (PNA). Bhutto called fresh elections, and PNA participated fully in those elections. They managed to contest the elections jointly even though there were grave splits on opinions and views within the party. The PNA faced defeat but did not accept the results, alleging that the election was rigged. On 11 March, the alliance called a nationwide strike followed by vicious demonstrations demanding fresh elections. Around 200 people were killed in the encounters between protestors and security forces. They proceeded to boycott the provincial elections. Despite this, there was a high voter turnout in the national elections; however, as provincial elections were held amidst low voter turnout and an opposition boycott, the PNA viewed Bhutto&#x27;s government as illegitimate.

Soon, all the opposition leaders called for the overthrow of Bhutto&#x27;s regime. Political and civil disorder intensified, which led to more unrest. On 21 April 1977, Bhutto imposed martial law in the major cities of Karachi, Lahore and Hyderabad. However, a compromise agreement between Bhutto and opposition was ultimately reported. Zia planned the Coup d&#x27;état carefully, as he knew Bhutto had integral intelligence in the Pakistan Armed Forces, and many officers, including Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal Zulfiqar Ali Khan and Major-General Tajammul Hussain Malik, GOC of 23rd Mountain Division, Major-General Naseerullah Babar, DG of Directorate-General for the Military Intelligence (DGMI) and Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, were loyal to Bhutto.

===1977 military coup===
The coup (codenamed &quot;Operation Fair Play&quot;) transpired in the small hours of 5 July 1977. Before the announcement of any agreement, Bhutto and members of his cabinet were arrested by troops of the Military Police under the order of Zia. Bhutto tried to call Zia but all telephone lines were disconnected. When Zia spoke to him later, he reportedly told Bhutto that he was sorry that he had been forced to perform such an &quot;unpleasant task&quot;. Zia and his military government portrayed the coup as a &quot;spontaneous response to a difficult situation&quot;, but his response was a complete contradiction. Soon after the coup, Zia told the British journalist Edward Behr of &quot;Newsweek&quot;:

However, Zia&#x27;s Chief of Army Staff General Khalid Mahmud Arif contradicted Zia&#x27;s statement when Arif noted that the coup had already been planned, and the senior leadership of Pakistan Armed Forces had solid information. Therefore, Arif met with Bhutto on an emergency basis, stressing and urging Bhutto to &quot;rush negotiations with the opposition&quot;. By Arif&#x27;s and independent expert&#x27;s accounts, the talks had not broken down even though the coup was very much in the offing. Zia further argued that &quot;Fair Play&quot; against Bhutto had been necessitated by the prospect of a civil war that Bhutto had been planning, by distributing weapons to his supporters. However, Arif strongly rejected Zia&#x27;s remarks on Bhutto, and citing no evidence that weapons were found or recovered at any of the party&#x27;s election offices, the military junta did not prosecute Bhutto on the charge of planning civil war. After deposing Prime Minister Bhutto on 5 July 1977, Zia-ul-Haq declared martial law, and appointed himself Chief Martial Law Administrator, which he remained until becoming president on 16 September 1978.

Immediately, the Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Shariff announced his and the navy&#x27;s strong support for Zia and his military government. But the Chief of Air Staff General Zulfikar Ali Khan remained unsupportive, but the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Muhammad Shariff remained neutral, while he silently expressed his support to Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto. In 1978, Zia pressured President Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry to appoint General Anwar Shamim as Chief of Air Staff; and Admiral Karamat Rahman Niazi as Chief of Naval Staff in 1979. On Zia&#x27;s recommendation, President Illahi appointed Admiral Mohammad Shariff as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, hence making the Admiral the highest-ranking officer and principal military adviser overlooking all of the inter-services, including the Chiefs of Staff of the respected forces. In 1979, the Chiefs of Army, Navy, and the Air Force, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff validated the coup as constitutional and legal under the war-torn circumstances, pledging their support to Zia as well.

== Dictatorship (1977–1988) ==
=== Postponement of elections and call for accountability ===
After assuming power as Chief Martial Law Administrator, Zia shortly appeared on national television, PTV promising to hold new and neutral parliamentary elections within the next 90 days
My sole aim is to organize free and fair elections which would be held in October this year. Soon after the polls, power will be transferred to the elected representatives of the people. I give a solemn assurance that I will not deviate from this schedule.

He also stated that the Constitution of Pakistan had not been abrogated, but temporarily suspended. Zia did not trust the civilian institutions and legislators to ensure the country&#x27;s integrity and sovereignty therefore, in October 1977, he announced the postponement of the electoral plan and decided to start an accountability process for the politicians. On television, Zia strongly defended his decision for postponing the elections and demanded that &quot;scrutiny of political leaders who had engaged in malpractice in the past&quot;. Thus, the PNA adopted its policy of &quot;retribution first, elections later&quot;. Zia&#x27;s policy severely tainted his credibility as many saw the broken promise as malicious. Another motive was that Zia widely suspected that once out of power the size of the Pakistan Peoples Party rallies would swell and better performance in elections was possible. This led to request for postponement of elections by the right-wing Islamists as well as left-wing socialists, formerly allied with Bhutto, which displaced Bhutto in the first place. Zia dispatched an intelligence unit, known as &quot;ISI&#x27;s&quot; Political Wing, sending Brigadier-General Taffazul Hussain Siddiqiui, to Bhutto&#x27;s native Province, Sindh, to assess whether people would accept martial law. The &quot;Political Wing&quot; also contacted the several right-wing Islamists and conservatives, promising an election, with PNA power-sharing the government with Zia. Zia successfully divided and separated the secular forces from right-wing Islamists and conservatives, and later purged each member of the secular front.

A Disqualification Tribunal was formed, and several individuals who had been members of parliament were charged with malpractice and disqualified from participating in politics at any level for the next seven years. A white paper document was issued, incriminating the deposed Bhutto government on several counts.

It is reported by senior officers that when Zia met federal secretaries for the first time as leader of the country after martial law, he said that &quot;He does not possess the charisma of Bhutto, personality of Ayub Khan or the legitimacy of Liaquat Ali Khan&quot; thereby implying how can he be marketed.

=== The doctrine of necessity ===
Nusrat Bhutto, the wife of the deposed Prime Minister, filed a suit against Zia&#x27;s military regime, challenging the validity of the July 1977 military coup. The Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled, in what would later be known as the &quot;Doctrine of Necessity&quot; (not to be confused with the 1954 doctrine of necessity) that, given the dangerously unstable political situation of the time, Zia&#x27;s overthrowing of the Bhutto government was legal on the grounds of necessity. The judgement tightened the general&#x27;s hold on the government. When Bhutto appeared personally to argue his appeal in the supreme court, he almost affirmed his concurrence with the judges present for not letting off a judgement without imposing some conditions on ruling military government.

=== Zulfikar Ali Bhutto trial ===
Former elected Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was arrested during the coup but released shortly afterwards. Upon his release, Bhutto travelled the country amid adulatory crowds of PPP supporters. On 3 September 1977, he was arrested again by the Army on charges of authorising the murder of a political opponent in March 1974. The trial proceedings began 24 October 1977 and lasted five months. On 18 March 1978, Bhutto was declared guilty of murder and was sentenced to death.

In the words of Aftab Kazie and Roedad Khan, Zia hated Bhutto and had used inappropriate language and insults to describe Bhutto and his colleagues. The Supreme Court ruled four to three in favour of execution. The High Court had given him the death sentence on charges of the murder of the father of Ahmed Raza Kasuri, a dissident PPP politician. Despite many clemency appeals from foreign leaders requesting Zia to commute Bhutto&#x27;s death sentence, Zia dismissed the appeals and upheld the death sentence.
On 4 April 1979, Bhutto was hanged, after the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence as passed by the Lahore High Court.

The hanging of an elected prime minister by a military dictator was condemned by the international community and by lawyers and jurists across Pakistan. Bhutto&#x27;s trial was highly controversial.

===Appointment of martial law administrators===

====Martial law judges====
The &quot;Ad hoc&quot; appointments of senior justices at the Supreme Court of Pakistan was one of the earliest and major steps were taken out by the military government under General Zia-ul-Haq. Zia had recognised the fact that since, Bhutto had good equations with the governments of the Soviet Union, China, and all the important western countries, excluding the United States. Still, it was a formidable array of sovereigns, presidents and prime ministers and the PPP can be forgiven for making a massive political miscalculations.

After calling for martial law, Zia pressured President Fazal Illahi to appoint Justice Sheikh Anwarul Haq to Chief Justice of Pakistan on 23 September 1977. Immediately, chief justice Yaqub Ali was forcefully removed from the office after the latter agreed to re-hear the petition filed at the supreme court by the peoples party&#x27;s chairwoman Nusrat Bhutto on 20 September 1977. After Justice Yaqub Ali&#x27;s removal, Bhutto objected to the inclusion of the new Chief Justice, Sheikh Anwar-ul-Haq, as a chief justice of the Bench on the grounds that by accepting the office of acting president during the absence of Zia-ul-Haq from the country, he had compromised his impartial status. Bhutto also stated that the Chief Justice in his public statements had been critical of his government in the recent past.

The objection was over-ruled by the Chief Justice Anwarul Haq, and the case of Bhutto was again heard by the Chief Justice Anwar-ul-Haq as the bench&#x27;s lead judge, and presided the whole case of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto while forcing the martial law throughout Pakistan. Shortly, after Zia&#x27;s return, another judge Mushtak Ahmad also gained Zia and Anwar-ul-Haq&#x27;s support and elevated as the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Chief Justice of Lahore High Court; he was too part of the bench who retained the death sentence of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto even though Bhutto was not declared guilty of the murder of the political opponent. In 1979, when Zia departed for Saudi Arabia, Justice Anwarul Haq served as interim president of Pakistan.

====Martial law governors====

The Zia regime largely made use of installing high-profile military generals to carte blanche provincial administration under martial law. Zia&#x27;s Guides Cavalry comrade Lieutenant-General Fazhle Haque was appointed Martial Law Administrator of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. Lieutenant-General Fazle Haque was considered a strong vocal General and a strong man. General Haque was the commander of the XI Corps, and commanding-general officer of the Army elements responsible for fighting a secret war against Soviet Union.

The second appointment was of Lieutenant-General S.M. Abbasi who was appointed Martial Law Administrator of Sindh Province; his tenure too saw civil disorder amid student riots. By contrast, third martial law administrator appointment of Lieutenant-General Ghulam Jilani Khan to the Punjab Province made much headway in beautifying Lahore extending infrastructure, and muting political opposition. The ascent of Nawaz Sharif to Chief Minister of Punjab was largely due to General Jilani&#x27;s sponsorship. Perhaps most crucially, final and fourth martial law administrator appointment was then-Lieutenant-General Rahimuddin Khan. Lieutenant-General Rahimuddin Khan was appointed to the post of Martial Law Administrator of Balochistan Province saw the disbanding of the Baloch insurgency, the containment of Afghan mujahidin, as well as the construction of nuclear test sites in the Chagai District.

Zia&#x27;s tenure saw the influx of heroin, sophisticated weaponry, and countless refugees in from neighbouring Afghanistan. Law and order deterioration was worse after he appointed Mr. Junejo as Prime minister in 1985. The government did not locate evidence of Zia having a relationship in the heroin trade, but has been considered.

Zia benefited from the extremely capable martial law administrators who previously had worked with the military governments of former president Yahya Khan and Ayub Khan in the 1960s. One of the notable officers that had worked with him were General Khalid Arief, Chief of Army Staff, and Admiral Mohammad Shariff, Chairman Joint Chiefs. Both were noted by Western governments as highly capable and had wide experience from the military government of the East-Pakistan and remained General Zia&#x27; confidential members.

Both Admiral Sharif and General Arif handled the matters efficiently if the matters were out of control by Zia. In 1979, Zia influenced the Navy&#x27;s Promotion Board several times after he succeeded first in the appointment of Admiral Karamat Rahman Niazi as Chief of Naval Staff in 1979, and Admiral Tarik Kamal Khan, also chief of naval staff, in 1983. On his request, then-President Fazal Illahi approved the appointment of General Anwar Shamim as Chief of Air Staff and following President&#x27;s resignation, Zia appointed Shamim as the Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator. In the matters of serious national security, General Zia had taken the chief of air staff and chief of naval staff in confidence after he discussed the matters with the respected chiefs of Staff. Zia&#x27;s appointment in inter-services were highly crucial for his military government and pre-emptive measure to ensure the continuous loyalty of Navy and Air Force to himself and his new military government.

=== Assumption of the post of President of Pakistan ===

Despite the dismissal of most of the Bhutto government, president Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry was persuaded to continue in office as a figurehead. After completing his term, and despite Zia&#x27;s insistence to accept an extension as President, Chaudhry resigned, and Zia took the office of President of Pakistan on 16 September 1978.

===Political structural changes===

==== Formation of Majlis-e-Shoora ====
Although ostensibly only holding office until free elections could be held, General Zia, like the previous military governments, disapproved of the lack of discipline and orderliness that often accompanies multiparty &quot;parliamentary democracy.&quot; He preferred a &quot;presidential&quot; form of government and a system of decision making by technical experts, or &quot;technocracy&quot;. His first replacement for the parliament or National Assembly was a &quot;Majlis-e-Shoora&quot;, or &quot;consultative council.&quot; After banning all political parties in 1979 he disbanded Parliament and at the end of 1981 set up the majlis, which was to act as a sort of board of advisors to the President and assist with the process of Islamization. The 350 members of the &quot;Shoora&quot; were to be nominated by the President and possessed only the power to consult with him, and in reality served only to endorse decisions already taken by the government. Most members of the &quot;Shoora&quot; were intellectuals, scholars, ulema, journalists, economists, and professionals in different fields.

Zia&#x27;s parliament and his military government reflect the idea of &quot;military-bureaucratic technocracy&quot; (MBT) where professionals, engineers, and high-profile military officers were initially part of his military government. His antipathy for the politicians led the promotion of bureaucratic-technocracy which was seen a strong weapon of countering the politicians and their political strongholds. Senior statesman and technocrats were included physicist-turned diplomat Agha Shahi, jurist Sharifuddin Perzada, corporate leader Nawaz Sharif, economist Mahbub ul Haq, and senior statesman Aftab Kazie, Roedad Khan, and chemist-turned diplomat Ghulam Ishaq Khan were a few of the leading technocratic figures in his military government.

==== 1984 referendum ====
After Bhutto&#x27;s execution, momentum to hold elections began to mount both internationally and within Pakistan. But before handing over power to elected representatives, Zia-ul-Haq attempted to secure his position as the head of state. A referendum was held on 19 December 1984 with the option being to elect or reject the General as the future President, the wording of the referendum making a vote against Zia appear to be a vote against Islam. According to official figures 97.8% of votes were cast in favour of Zia, however only 20% of the electorate participated in the referendum.

==== 1985 parliamentary elections and constitutional amendments ====
After holding the 1984 referendum, Zia succumbed to international pressure and gave permission to election commission to hold national wide general elections but without political parties in February 1985. Most of the major opposing political parties decided to boycott the elections but election results showed that many victors belonged to one party or the other. Critics complained that ethnic and sectarian mobilisation filled the void left by banning political parties (or making elections &quot;non-partisan&quot;), to the detriment of national integration.

The General worked to give himself the power to dismiss the Prime Minister dissolve the National Assembly, appoint provincial governors and the chief of the armed forces. His prime minister Muhammad Khan Junejo was known as an unassuming and soft-spoken Sindhi.

Before handing over the power to the new government and lifting the martial law, Zia got the new legislature to retroactively accept all of Zia&#x27;s actions of the past eight years, including his coup of 1977. He also managed to get several amendments passed, most notably the Eighth Amendment, which granted &quot;&quot;reserve power&quot;s&quot; to the president to dissolve the Parliament. However, this amendment considerably reduced the power he&#x27;d previously granted himself to dissolve the legislature, at least on paper. The text of the amendment permitted Zia to dissolve the Parliament only if the government had been toppled by a vote of no confidence and it was obvious that no one could form a government or the government could not function in a constitutional manner.

==== Economic policy ====


In general Zia gave economic development and policy a fairly low priority (aside from Islamization) and delegating its management to technocrats such as Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Aftab Qazi and Vaseem Jaffrey.
 However, between 1977 and 1986, the country experienced an average annual growth in the GNP of 6.8%—the highest in the world at that time—thanks in large part to remittances from the overseas workers, rather than government policy. The first year of Zia&#x27;s government coincided with a dramatic rise in remittances, which totalled $3.2 billion/year for most of the 1980s, accounted for 10 percent of Pakistans&#x27;s GDP; 45 percent of its current account receipts, and 40 percent of total foreign exchange earnings.

By the time General Zia had initiated the coup against Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto, the economic cycle process of nationalisation program was completed. The socialist orientation and nationalisation program was slowly reversed; the idea of corporatisation was heavily favoured by President Zia-ul-Haq to direct the authoritarianism in the nationalised industries. One of his well-known and earliest initiatives were aimed to Islamize the national economy which featured the Interest-free economic cycle. No actions towards privatising the industries were ordered by President Zia; only three steel mill industries were returned to its previous owners.

By the end of 1987, the finance ministry had begun studying the process of engaging the gradual privatisation and economic liberalisation.

===United States sponsorship===

The United States, notably the Ronald Reagan administration, was an ardent supporter of Zia&#x27;s military regime and a close ally of Pakistan&#x27;s conservative-leaning ruling military establishment. The Reagan administration declared Zia&#x27;s regime as the &quot;front line&quot; ally of the United States in the fight against the threat of Communism. American legislators and senior officials most notable were Zbigniew Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, Charlie Wilson, Joanne Herring, and the civilian intelligence officers Michael Pillsbury and Gust Avrakotos, and senior US military officials General John William Vessey, and General Herbert M. Wassom, had been long associated with the Zia military regime where they had made frequent trips to Pakistan advising on expanding the idea of establishment in the political circle of Pakistan. Nominally, the American conservatism of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Republican Party influenced Zia to adopt his idea of Islamic conservatism as the primary line of his military government, forcefully enforcing the Islamic and other religious practices in the country.

The socialist orientation had greatly alarmed the capitalist forces in Pakistan and alarmed the United States who feared the loss of Pakistan as an ally in the cold war. Many of Pakistan&#x27;s political scientists and historians widely suspected that the riots and coup against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was orchestrated with help of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Government because United States growing fear of Bhutto&#x27;s socialist policies which were seen as sympathetic towards the Soviet Union and had built a bridge that allowed Soviet Union to be involved in Pakistan, and had access through Pakistan&#x27;s warm water port; something that the United States was unable to gain access since the establishment of Pakistan in 1947. Former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark widely suspected the United States&#x27; involvement in bringing down the Bhutto&#x27;s government, and publicly accused the United States&#x27; Government after attending the trial. On the other hand, the United States refused any involvement in Bhutto&#x27;s fall, and argued that it was Bhutto who had alienated himself over the five years. While witnessing the dramatic fall of Bhutto, one US diplomat in American Embassy in Islamabad wrote that:

=== Foreign affairs ===

==== Soviet–Afghan War ====

On 25 December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Following this invasion, Zia chaired a meeting and was asked by several cabinet members to refrain from interfering in the war, owing to the vastly superior military power of the USSR. Zia, however, was ideologically opposed to the idea of communism taking over a neighbouring country, supported by the fear of Soviet advancement into Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, in search of warm waters, and made no secret about his intentions of monetarily and militarily aiding the Afghan resistance (the Mujahidin) with major assistance from the United States.

American president Jimmy Carter offered $400 million aid package to Pakistan; Zia ridiculed the offer as &quot;peanuts&quot;. Zia ultimately succeeded in winning an increased aid of $3.2 billion provided by Carter&#x27;s successor Ronald Reagan.

During this meeting, the Director-General of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) then-Lieutenant-General Akhtar Abdur Rahman advocated for a covert operation in Afghanistan by arming Islamic Extremists. After this meeting, Zia authorised this operation under General Rahman, and it was later merged with Operation Cyclone, a programme funded by the United States and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

In November 1982, Zia travelled to Moscow to attend the funeral of Leonid Brezhnev, the late General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and new Secretary General Yuri Andropov met with Zia there. Andropov expressed indignation over Pakistan&#x27;s support of the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union and its satellite state, Socialist Afghanistan. Zia took his hand and assured him, &quot;General Secretary, believe me, Pakistan wants nothing but very good relations with the Soviet Union&quot;. According to Gromyko, Zia&#x27;s sincerity convinced them, but Zia&#x27;s actions didn&#x27;t live up to his words.

Zia reversed many of Bhutto&#x27;s foreign policy initiatives by first establishing stronger links with the United States, Japan, and the Western world. Zia broken off relations with the Socialist state and State capitalism became his major economic policy. US politician Charlie Wilson claims that he worked with Zia and the CIA to channel Soviet weapons that Israel captured from the PLO in Lebanon to fighters in Afghanistan. Wilson claims that Zia remarked to him: &quot;Just don&#x27;t put any stars of David on the boxes&quot;.

==== Iran–Iraq War ====
On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi invasion of Iran initiated a nearly eight-year long war between Iran and Iraq. In an effort to end the war and maintain unity of the Islamic world, Zia visited Tehran on 27 September and Baghdad on 29 September. Despite declaring neutrality, Zia maintained close relations with Iran and Pakistan sold weapons to Iran, which proved to be a main factor for the Iranian victory in the Tanker War.

=== Consolidation of atomic bomb program ===
One of the earliest initiatives taken by Zia in 1977, was to militarize the integrated atomic energy program which was founded by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1972. During the first stages, the program was under the control of Bhutto and the Directorate for Science, under Science Advisor Dr. Mubashir Hassan, who was heading the civilian committee that supervised the construction of the facilities and laboratories. This atomic bomb project had no boundaries with Munir Ahmad Khan and Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan leading their efforts separately and reported to Bhutto and his science adviser Dr. Hassan who had little interest in the atomic bomb project. Major-General Zahid Ali Akbar, an engineering officer, had little role in the atomic project; Zia responded by taking over the program under military control and disbanded the civilian directorate when he ordered the arrest of Hassan. This whole giant nuclear energy project was transferred into the administrative hands of Major-General Akbar who was soon made the Lieutenant-General and Engineer-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers to deal with the authorities whose co-operation was required. Akbar consolidated the entire project by placing the scientific research under military control, setting boundaries and goals. Akbar proved to be an extremely capable officer in the matters of science and technology when he aggressively led the development of nuclear weapons under Munir Ahmad Khan and Abdul Qadeer Khan in a matter of five years.

By the time, Zia assumed control, the research facilities became fully functional and 90% of the work on atom bomb project was completed. Both the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) had built the extensive research infrastructure started by Bhutto. Akbar&#x27;s office was shifted to Army&#x27;s General Headquarters (GHQ) and Akbar guided Zia on key matters of nuclear science and atomic bomb production. He became the first engineering officer to have acknowledge Zia about the success of this energy project into a fully matured program. On the recommendation of Akbar, Zia approved the appointment of Munir Ahmad Khan as the scientific director of the atomic bomb project, as Zia was convinced by Akbar that civilian scientists under Munir Khan&#x27;s directorship were at their best to counter international pressure.

This was proved when the PAEC conducted the cold-fission test of a fission device, codename &quot;Kirana-I&quot; on 11 March 1983 at the Weapon-Testing Laboratories-I, under the leadership of weapon-testing laboratory&#x27;s director Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad. Lieutenant-General Zahid Akbar went to GHQ and notified Zia about the success of this test. The PAEC responded by conducting several cold-tests throughout the 1980s, a policy also continued by Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s. According to the reference in the book, &quot;Eating Grass&quot;, Zia was so deeply convinced of the infiltration of Western and American moles and spies into the project, that he extended his role in the atomic bomb, which reflected extreme &quot;paranoia&quot;, in both his personal and professional life. He virtually had PAEC and KRL separated from each other and made critical administrative decisions rather than putting scientists in charge of the aspects of the atomic programs. His actions spurred innovation in the atomic bomb project and an intense secrecy and security culture permeated PAEC and KRL.

====Nuclear diplomacy====

Unlike Bhutto, who faced rogue criticism and a heated diplomatic war with the United States throughout the 1970s, Zia took different diplomatic approaches to counter the international pressure. From 1979 to 1983, the country was made a subject of attack by international organization for not signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT); Zia deftly neutralized international pressure by tagging Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons program to the nuclear designs of the neighboring Indian nuclear program. Zia, with the help of Munir Ahmad Khan and Agha Shahi, Foreign Minister, drew a five-point proposal as a practical rejoinder to world pressure on Pakistan to sign the NPT; the points including the renouncing of the use of nuclear weapons. He also escalated Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb project, and instituted industrialization and deregulation, helping Pakistan&#x27;s economy become the fastest-growing in South Asia, overseeing the highest GDP growth in the country&#x27;s history.

Following the success of &quot;Operation Opera&quot; – in which an Israeli Air Force strike took place to destroy the Iraqi nuclear program in 1981 – suspicion grew in Pakistan that the Indian Air Force had similar plans for Pakistan. In a private meeting with General Anwar Shamim, then-Chief of Air Staff, Zia had notified General Shamim that the Indian Air Force had plans to infiltrate Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear energy project, citing solid evidence. Shamim felt that the Air Force was unable to divert such attacks, therefore, he advised Zia to use diplomacy through Munir Ahmad Khan to divert the attacks. At Vienna, Munir Ahmad Khan met with Indian physicist Raja Ramanna and notified him that such an attack would provoke a nuclear war between the two countries. In the meantime, Shamim decided to start the program to acquire the F-16 Falcons and A-5 Fanton jets for the Pakistan Air Force. Shamim launched &quot;Operation Sentinel&quot;- a counter operation that thwarted the Israeli Air Force attempt to sabotage Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear energy project—forced Indian Premier Indira Gandhi to hold talks with Pakistan on nuclear issues and directed a high delegation to Pakistan where both countries pledged not to assist or attack each other&#x27;s facilities. In 1985, following the induction of the F-16 Falcons and A-5 Fantons, Shamim commissioned the Air Force Strategic Command to protect and battle the weapons of mass destruction.

In 1977, Zia ultimately adopted the policy of &quot;nuclear opacity&quot; to deliberately deny the atomic bomb programs. This policy of nuclear ambiguity was adopted after witnessing the success of Israel&#x27;s nuclear program and on multiple occasions Zia broke his words and promises concerning the nature of the country&#x27;s atomic bomb project. On nuclear policy issues, Zia deliberately misguided the United States and concealed classified information from the outside world. The United States trusted Zia&#x27;s sincerity and his promises made to the United States; Zia gave assurances to the United States not to produce weapons-grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) above a 5% level. However, the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Vernon Walter, confronted Zia on his secret trip to Pakistan in October 1981. Confronted with the evidence, Zia acknowledged that the information &quot;must be true,&quot; but then denied everything, leading Walters to conclude that: &quot;either Zia &quot;did not know the facts&quot; or was the &quot;most superb and patriotic liar I have ever met...&quot;.

====Nuclear proliferation====

Soon after the coup, the clandestine nuclear energy project was no longer a secret to the outside world. Part of his strategy was the promotion of nuclear proliferation in anti-western states (such as North Korea, Iran, and communist China) to aid their own nuclear ambitions, to divert international attention which was difficult. In 1981, Zia contracted with China when he sent weapon-grade uranium to China and also built the centrifuge laboratory which increasingly enhanced the Chinese nuclear program. This act encouraged Abdul Qadeer Khan, who allegedly tried to aid the Libyan nuclear programme but because Libya–Pakistan relations were strained, Khan was warned of serious consequences. This policy envisaged that this would deflect international pressure onto these countries, and Pakistan would be spared the international community&#x27;s wrath.

After Zia&#x27;s death, his successor General Mirza Aslam Beg, as Chief of Army Staff, encouraged Abdul Qadeer Khan and gave him a free hand to work with some like-minded nations such as North Korea, Iran and Libya which also wanted to pursue their nuclear ambitions for a variety of reasons. In 2004, Abdul Qadeer Khan&#x27;s dismissal from the nuclear weapons program was considered a face saving exercise by the Pakistan Armed Forces and political establishment under the then Chief of Army Staff and President General Pervez Musharraf. Zia&#x27;s nuclear proliferation policy had a deep impact on the world, especially anti-western states, most nominally North Korea and Iran. In the 2000s (decade), North Korea would soon follow the same suit after it was targeted by the international community for its on-going nuclear program. In the 2000s (decade), North Korea attempted to aid the Syrian and Iranian nuclear program in the 1990s. The North Korean connection to the Syrian nuclear program was exposed in 2007 by Israel in its successful strategic operation, &quot;Orchard&quot;, which resulted in them sabotaging the Syrian nuclear program as well as the deaths of 10 senior North Korean scientists who were aiding the nuclear program.

====Expansion====

Even though Zia had removed the Bhutto sentiment in the nuclear energy project, Zia did not completely disband Bhutto&#x27;s policy on nuclear weapons. After the retirement of Zahid Ali Akbar, Zia transferred control of the nuclear weapons program to Bhutto&#x27;s close aide Munir Ahmad Khan, Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Soon, Zia promoted Khan as the technical director of the entire program as well as appointing Khan as his Science Adviser. With the support of handpicked civilian Prime Minister Muhammad Juneijo, Zia sanctioned the launch of the 50 Megawatt (MW) heavy water plutonium production reactor, known as &quot;Khushab-I&quot;, at Khushab in 1985. Zia also took initiatives to launch the space projects as spin-off to nuclear project. Zia appointed nuclear engineer Salim Mehmud as the Administrator of the Space Research Commission. Zia also launched the work on the country&#x27;s first satellite, &quot;Badr-1&quot;, a military satellite. In 1987, Zia launched the clandestine aerospace project, the Integrated Missile Research Program under General Anwar Shamim in 1985, and later under Lieutenant-General Talat Masood in 1987.

==== The legacy of the Soviet-Afghan war ====
The rise of the illicit drug trade and its spread through Pakistan to the rest of the world increased tremendously during the Soviet-Afghan war. Afghanistan&#x27;s drug industry began to take off after the Soviet invasion in 1979. Desperate for cash with which to buy weapons, various elements in the anti-Communist resistance turned to the drug trade. This was tolerated if not condoned by their American sponsors such as the CIA and by senior officers of the Pakistan Army around Zia-ul-Haq.

===Islamization of Pakistan===
The &quot;primary&quot; policy or &quot;centerpiece&quot; of Zia&#x27;s government was &quot;Sharization&quot; or &quot;Islamization&quot;.

In 1977, before the coup, the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims, along with nightclubs, and horse racing was banned by Prime Minister Bhutto to stem the tide of street Islamization.
Zia went much further, committing himself to enforce &quot;Nizam-e-Mustafa&quot; (&quot;Rule of the prophet&quot; or Islamic System, i.e. establishing an Islamic state and sharia law), a significant turn from Pakistan&#x27;s predominantly secular law, inherited from the British.

In his first televised speech to the country as head of state Zia declared that
Pakistan which was created in the name of Islam will continue to survive only if it sticks to Islam. That is why I consider the introduction of [an] Islamic system as an essential prerequisite for the country.
In the past, he complained, &quot;Many a ruler did what they pleased in the name of Islam.&quot;

Zia established &quot;Sharia Benches&quot; in each High Court (later the Federal Sharia Court) to judge legal cases using the teachings of the Quran and the Sunna, and to align Pakistan&#x27;s legal statutes with Islamic doctrine.
Zia bolstered the influence of the &quot;ulama&quot; (Islamic clergy) and the Islamic parties. 10,000s of activists from the Jamaat-e-Islami party were appointed to government posts to ensure the continuation of his agenda after his passing. Conservative &quot;ulama&quot; (Islamic scholars) were added to the Council of Islamic Ideology.

Islamization was a sharp change from Bhutto&#x27;s original philosophical rationale captured in the slogan, &quot;Food, clothing, and shelter&quot;. In Zia&#x27;s view, socialist economics and a secular-socialist orientation served only to upset Pakistan&#x27;s natural order and weaken its moral fiber. General Zia defended his policies in an interview in 1979 given to British journalist Ian Stephens:

How much of Zia&#x27;s motivation came from piety and how much from political calculation is disputed. One author points out that Zia was conspicuously silent on the dispute between the heterodox Zikri and the &#x27;Ulama in Balochistan where he needed stability. Secular and leftist forces accused Zia of manipulating Islam for political ends. According to Nusrat Bhutto, former First Lady of Pakistan:

How much success Zia had using state-sponsored Islamization to strengthen national cohesion is also disputed. The Zakat and Ushr Ordinance was implemented in 1980. The measure called for a 2.5% annual deduction from personal bank accounts on the first day of Ramadan, with the revenue to be used for poverty relief. Zakat committees were established to oversee the distribution of the funds. The measure was opposed by Shia Muslims, who do not consider the collection of Zakat an obligation. In the first days of the tax, Shia Muslims who followed the Ja&#x27;fari school raised strong opposition, and in April 1981, the government made an exemption allowing Shia to file for exemptions.

Among Sunni Muslims, Deobandis and Barelvis also had disputes. Zia favored the Deobandi doctrine and so the Sufi pirs of Sindh (who were Barelvis) joined the anti-Zia Movement for the Restoration of Democracy.

Canadian-Pakistani Sufi imam Syed Soharwardy says that Zia &quot;changed Pakistan from a Sufi-dominated state to a Salafi-dominated state&quot;, estimating that if 70% of mosques were Sufis due to Zia they&#x27;re now at 55%, and in the Army, this change has been even more radical, as he estimates that military mosques went from 90% Sufi in the 70s to now 85% Deobandis.

====Hudood Ordinance====
One of his first and most controversial measures to Islamize Pakistani society was the replacement of parts of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) with the 1979 &quot;Hudood Ordinance.&quot; (Hudood meaning limits or restrictions, as in limits of acceptable behavior in Islamic law.) The Ordinance added new criminal offenses of adultery and fornication to Pakistani law, and new punishments of whipping, amputation, and stoning to death.

For theft or robbery, the PPC punishments of imprisonment fine, or both, were replaced by amputation of the right hand of the offender for theft, and amputation of the right hand and left foot for robbery. For &quot;Zina&quot; (extramarital sex) the provisions relating to adultery were replaced by the Ordinance with punishments of 100 lashes for those unmarried offenders, and stoning to death for married offenders.

All these punishments were dependent on the proof required for &quot;hadd&quot; being met. In practice, the Hudd requirement—four Muslim men of good repute testifying as witnesses to the crime—was seldom met. As of 2014, no offenders have been stoned or had limbs amputated by the Pakistani judicial system. To be found guilty of theft, &quot;Zina&quot;, or drinking alcohol by less strict &quot;tazir&quot; standards—where the punishment was flogging and/or imprisonment—was common, and there have been many floggings.

More worrisome for human rights and women&#x27;s rights advocates, lawyers, and politicians was the incarceration of thousands of rape victims on charges of &quot;Zina&quot;. The onus of providing proof in a rape case rests with the woman herself. Uncorroborated testimony by women was inadmissible in hudood crimes. If the victim/accuser was unable to prove her allegation, bringing the case to court was considered equivalent to a confession of sexual intercourse outside of lawful marriage. Despite this, the ordinance remained in force until the Women&#x27;s Protection Bill was passed in 2006.

Although the Sharia punishments were imposed, the due process, witnesses, law of evidence, and prosecution system remained Anglo-Saxon.

The hybridization of Pakistan&#x27;s penal code with Islamic laws was difficult because of the difference in the underlying logic of the two legal systems. PPC was kingly law, &quot;Haddood&quot; is a religious and community-based law.

====Islamic Law====
Under Zia, the order for women to cover their heads while in public was implemented in public schools, colleges, and state television. Women&#x27;s participation in sports and the performing arts was severely restricted. Following Sharia law, women&#x27;s legal testimony was given half the weight of a man&#x27;s, .

In 1981 interest payments were replaced by &quot;profit and loss&quot; accounts (though profit was thought to be simply interest by another name). Textbooks were overhauled to remove un-Islamic material, and un-Islamic books were removed from libraries.

Eating and drinking during Ramadan were outlawed, and attempts were made to enforce praying of salat five times a day.

====Blasphemy ordinances====
To outlaw blasphemy, the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) were amended through ordinances in 1980, 1982, and 1986. The 1980 law prohibited derogatory remarks against Islamic personages and carried a three-year prison sentence. In 1982 the small Ahmadiyya religious minority were prohibited from saying or implying they were Muslims. In 1986 declaring anything implying disrespect to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot; (family members of Muhammad), &quot;Sahabah&quot; (companions of Muhammad) or &quot;Sha&#x27;ar-i-Islam&quot; (Islamic symbols) was made a cognizable offense, punishable with imprisonment or fine, or both.

====Madrassa expansions====
Traditional religious madrassas in Pakistan received state sponsorship for the first time, under General Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s administration, their number grew from 893 to 2,801. Most were Deobandi in doctrinal orientation, while one-quarter of them were Barelvi. They received funding from Zakat councils and provided free religious training, room, and board to impoverished Pakistanis. The schools, which banned televisions and radios, have been criticized by authors for stoking sectarian hatred both between Muslim sects and against non-Muslims.

====Cultural policies====

In a 1979 address to the nation, Zia decried the Western culture and music in the country. Soon afterward, PTV, the national television network ceased playing music videos and only patriotic songs were broadcast. New taxes were levied on the film industry and most of the cinemas in Lahore were shut down. New tax rates were introduced, further decreasing cinema attendances.

It was under Zia and the economic prosperity of his era that the country&#x27;s urban middle and lower-middle-classes expanded and Western 1980s fashion wear and hairstyle spread in popularity, and rock music bands gained momentum, according to leftist cultural critic Nadeem F. Paracha.

====Welfare of the people with disabilities====
During his tenure, he oversaw the passing of an ordinance for the welfare of people with disabilities. The ordinance is called &quot;The Disabled Persons (Employment and Rehabilitation) Ordinance, 1981&quot; and it was passed into law on 29 December 1981. It provides measures for the employment, rehabilitation, and welfare of people with disabilities.

=== Dismissal of the Junejo government and call for new elections ===
As time passed, the legislature wanted to have more freedom and power and by the beginning of 1988, rumours about the differences between Prime Minister Muhammad Khan Junejo and Zia were rife.

It is said by some that Zia-Junejo rift was encouraged by late Mahboob-ul-Haq and Junejo&#x27;s insistence on signing Geneva pact without deciding the composition of next government of Afghanistan before Soviet withdrawal. Junejo also gave Benazir a seat next to him in parleys before that. Junejo did not strengthen the Islamization drive and rather weakened it. His era led to serious disturbances in Karachi and ultimately Karachi went into the secular control of MQM from Jamaat-e-Islami.

Ojhri Camp blast had irreversibly weakened Zia. Junejo was committed to make an investigation into the Ojhri camp disaster. This couldn&#x27;t be digested by President as it would expose the involvement of ISI and Zia co- fellow Generals. After defeat of Soviet army, America wanted to audit the ammunition and missiles supplied to Pakistan for mujahidin, most of which has been stored by Pakistan for future targets against India or other enemies. So Zia planned this event in a very cruel manner, having sacrificed the lives of people of Pakistan for fulfillment of their own agenda.

On 29 May 1988, Zia dissolved the National Assembly and removed the Prime Minister under article 58(2)b of the amended Constitution. Apart from many other reasons, Prime Minister Junejo&#x27;s decision to sign the Geneva Accord against the wishes of Zia, and his open declarations of removing any military personnel found responsible for an explosion at a munitions dump at Ojhri Camp, on the outskirts of army headquarters in Rawalpindi, earlier in the year, proved to be some of the major factors responsible for his removal. Relations with India worsened amid the Siachen conflict and accusations that Pakistan was aiding the Khalistan movement.

Zia promised to hold elections in 1988 after the dismissal of Junejo government. He said that he would hold elections within the next 90 days. The late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s daughter Benazir Bhutto had returned from exile earlier in 1986, and had announced that she would be contesting the elections. With Bhutto&#x27;s popularity somewhat growing, and a decrease in international aid following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Zia was in an increasingly difficult political situation.

== Death ==

Zia died in a plane crash on 17 August 1988. After witnessing a US M1 Abrams tank demonstration in Bahawalpur, Zia had left the city in the Punjab province by C-130B Hercules aircraft. The aircraft departed from Bahawalpur Airport and was expected to reach Islamabad International Airport. Shortly after a smooth takeoff, the control tower lost contact with the aircraft. Witnesses who saw the plane in the air afterward claim it was flying erratically, then nosedived and exploded on impact. In addition to Zia, 29 others died in the plane crash, including Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Akhtar Abdur Rahman, close associate of Zia, Brigadier Siddique Salik, the American ambassador to Pakistan Arnold Lewis Raphel and General Herbert M. Wassom, the head of the US military aid mission to Pakistan. Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the Senate chairman, announced Zia&#x27;s death on radio and TV. Conditions surrounding his death have given rise to many conspiracy theories. There is speculation that the Soviet Union (in retaliation for Pakistani support of the mujahidin in Afghanistan) or an alliance of them and internal groups within Zia&#x27;s military were behind the incident.

A board of inquiry was set up to investigate the crash. It concluded &#x27;the most probable cause of the crash was a criminal act of sabotage perpetrated in the aircraft&#x27;. It also suggested that poisonous gases were released which incapacitated the passengers and crew, which would explain why no Mayday signal was given. There was also speculation into other facts involving the details of the investigation. A flight recorder (black box) was not located after the crash even though previous C-130 aircraft did have them installed.

His funeral was held on 19 August 1988 near Islamabad. Nearly one million mourners joined in chants of &quot;Zia ul-Haq, you will live as long as the sun and moon remain above.&quot; His remains were laid to rest in a dirt grave in front of the Faisal Mosque that Zia and the Saudi government had built as a symbol of Pakistani-Saudi friendship. Also in attendance was his successor President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, chiefs of staff of armed forces, chairman joint chiefs, and other high military and civil officials. Former US Secretary of State George P. Shultz also laid a floral wreath at Zia&#x27;s grave.

==== In Pakistan ====

Even after his death, Zia-ul-Haq remained a highly polarizing and widely discussed figure in the country&#x27;s intellectual and political circles. Out of the country&#x27;s short history, Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s legacy remains a most toxic, enduring, and tamper-proof legacy, according to the editorial written in &quot;Dawn&quot;. He is also praised for defeating the Soviets. Indian journalist Kallol Bhattacherjee, an author of a book on Afghanistan, said:&quot;There will not be another Zia in South Asia. He was unique and multidimensional like all complex characters of South Asian history. I admire Zia&#x27;s guts, though not his methods, especially in regards to Islam. He successfully took on nuclear India and changed the balance of power that Indira Gandhi created in the 1971 war and broke all rules to acquire nuclear weapons for Pakistan.&quot;Historians and political scientists widely discussed and studied his policy making skills, some authors noting him as &quot;The Ringmaster&quot;, &quot;Master of Illusion&quot; and &quot;Master Tactician&quot;. However, his most remembered and enduring legacy was his indirect involvement and military strategies, by proxy supporting the Mujahidin, against the USSR&#x27;s war in Afghanistan. His reign also helped the conservatives to rise at the national politics against Benazir Bhutto. He is also noted as being one of Pakistan&#x27;s most successful generals, placing the armed forces in charge of the country&#x27;s affairs. During his regime, western styles in hair, clothing, and music flooded the country. The 1980s gave birth to Pakistani rock music, which expressed Pakistani nationalism in the country.

To this day, Zia remains a polarizing figure in Pakistan&#x27;s history, credited with preventing wider Soviet incursions into the region as well as economic prosperity, but decried for weakening democratic institutions, passing laws encouraging religious intolerance, and depreciating the rupee with managed float policies. He is also cited for promoting the early political career of Nawaz Sharif, who would be thrice elected Prime Minister.

With the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan (2010), the executive powers General Zia had legislated were permanently removed from the Constitution of Pakistan.

==== Outside Pakistan ====
Zia is credited with stopping an expected Soviet invasion of Pakistan. Former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki Al-Faisal, who worked with Zia during the 1980s against the Soviets, described Zia in the following words: &quot;He was a very steady and smart person with a geo-strategic mind, particularly after the invasion by Soviets. He was very dedicated in preventing the Soviet invasion of Pakistan.&quot; Bruce Riedel, an American academic specializing in international affairs and geopolitics, wrote that &quot;in many ways, the Afghan war was Zia&#x27;s war&quot;, in the sense that Zia pushed the Americans, initially reluctant and even skeptical, to participate in the proxy war against the Soviets, Riedel also arguing that &quot;Zia ul-Haq was not only a pivotal figure in the history of his country and the war in Afghanistan, he was also a pivotal figure in the final stage of the Cold War, which had dominated global politics for almost half a century.&quot;

=== Portrayals in popular culture ===
Zia has been portrayed in English language popular culture a number of times including:
* In the novel &quot;Shame&quot; (1983) by British-Indian author Salman Rushdie, the character of general Raza Hyder shows strong parallels to the life of Zia-Ul-Haq.
* In the comic &quot;Shattered Visage&quot; (1988–1989), it is implied that Zia&#x27;s death was orchestrated by the same intelligence agency that ran The Village from the show &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967).
* Zia was portrayed by Indian actor Om Puri in the 2007 film &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;.
* Zia is caricatured as one of the main protagonists in Mohammed Hanif&#x27;s 2008 satirical novel &quot;A Case of Exploding Mangoes&quot; which is loosely based around the events of his death.
* The oppressive regime of Zia-ul-Haq and the execution of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was referenced in the book &quot;Songs of Blood and Sword&quot; (2010), a non-fiction memoir by Murtaza Bhutto&#x27;s daughter Fatima Bhutto.
* Zia was portrayed by Indian actor Ashwath Bhatt in the 2023 Netflix action-thriller movie &quot;Mission Majnu&quot;.

<doc id="235341" wikidata="Q1249656" url="?curid=235341" title="Street, Somerset">
<text>Street is a large village and civil parish in Somerset, England, with a population of 12,709 in 2021. On a dry spot in the Somerset Levels, at the end of the Polden Hills, it is southwest of Glastonbury. There is evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the history of the village is dominated by Glastonbury Abbey, and a 12th-century causeway from Glastonbury built to transport local Blue Lias stone to it.

The Society of Friends was established there by the mid-17th century. One Quaker family, the Clarks, started a business in sheepskin rugs, woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes. This became C&amp;J Clark which still has its headquarters in Street. In 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom. The Shoe Museum provides information about the history of Clarks and footwear manufacture in general.

The Clark family&#x27;s former mansion and its estate at the edge of the village are now owned by Millfield School, an independent co-educational boarding school. Street is also home to Crispin School and Strode College.

To the north of Street is the River Brue, which marks the boundary with Glastonbury. South of Street are the Walton and Ivythorn Hills and East Polden Grasslands biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Strode Theatre provides a venue for films, exhibitions and live performances. The Anglican Parish Church of The Holy Trinity dates from the 14th century and has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.

==History==
The settlement&#x27;s earliest known name is Lantokay, meaning the sacred enclosure of Kea, a Celtic saint. The place-name &#x27;Street&#x27; is first attested in Anglo-Saxon charters from 725 and 971, where it appears as &quot;Stret&quot;. It appears as &quot;Strete juxta Glastone&quot; in a charter from 1330 formerly in the British Museum. The word is the Old English &quot;straet&quot; meaning &#x27;Roman road&#x27;.

The centre of Street is where Lower Leigh hamlet was, and the road called Middle Leigh and the community called Overleigh are to the south of the village. In the 12th century, a causeway from Glastonbury was built to transport stone from what is now Street for rebuilding Glastonbury Abbey after a major fire in 1184. The causeway is about north of a Roman road running north from Ilchester. It will be seen that the name of the village predates the building of the causeway by more than four hundred years, and so the village is named after the Roman road and not the causeway.
The parish of Street was part of the Whitley Hundred.

Quarries of the local blue lias stone were worked from as early as the 12th century to the end of the 19th century. It is a geological formation in southern England, part of the Lias Group. The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers, laid down in latest Triassic and early Jurassic times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. Its age corresponds to the Rhaetian to lower Sinemurian stages of the geologic timescale, thus fully including the Hettangian stage. It is the lowest of the three divisions of the Lower Jurassic period and, as such, is also given the name &quot;Lower Lias&quot;. It consists of thin blue argillaceous, or clay-like, limestone. The Blue Lias contains many fossils, especially ammonites. Fossils discovered in the lias include many ichthyosaurs, one of which has been adopted as the badge of Street. There is a display of Street fossils in the Natural History Museum in London.

The churchyard of the Parish Church has yielded one Iron Age coin, however the origin and significance is unclear, although the Dobunni were known to have produced coins in the area. A number of Roman pottery fragments, now in the Museum of Somerset. Remains of Roman villas exist on the south edge of Street near Marshalls Elm and Ivythorn. Buried remains of a Roman road were excavated in the early 20th century on the flood-plain of the river Brue between Glastonbury and Street. The parish churchyard is on the first flood-free ground near the river Brue and was probably the first land to be inhabited. The form of the large churchyard suggests a &quot;lan&quot;, a sacred area of a kind that was built in the first half of the 6th century. Llan or Lan is a common place name element in Brythonic languages such as Welsh, Cornish, Breton, Cumbric, and possibly Pictish. The original meaning of &quot;llan&quot; in Welsh is &quot;an enclosed piece of land&quot;, but it later evolved to mean the parish surrounding a church.

One biography of St Gildas has the saint spending some time in Glastonbury Abbey, and moving to a site by the river, where he built a chapel to the Holy Trinity and there died. The Parish Church, now Holy Trinity, has at times been known as St Gildas&#x27; church. Glastonbury Abbey controlled Street until the Dissolution.

Sharpham Park is a historic park, approximately west of Street, which dates back to the Bronze Age. The first known reference is a grant by King Edwy to the then Aethelwold in 957. In 1191 Sharpham Park was conferred by the soon-to-be King John to the Abbots of Glastonbury, who remained in possession of the park and house until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the Duke of Somerset, Sir Edward Seymour, brother of Queen Jane; the Thynne family of Longleat, and the family of Sir Henry Gould. Sir Edward Dyer the Elizabethan poet and courtier (died 1607) was born here in 1543. The house is now a private residence and Grade II* listed building. Sharpham was also the birthplace of the novelist and dramatist Henry Fielding (1707–54), and the cleric William Gould.

Ivythorn Manor on Pages Hill was a medieval monastic house. It was rebuilt in 1488 for Abbot John Selwood of Glastonbury Abbey. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries it became a manor house owned by the Marshall and Sydenham families. Sir John Sydenham added a wing 1578 which was later demolished. By 1834 the house was largely ruined until its restoration around 1904, and a west wing was added in 1938. It is a Grade II* listed building.

==Governance==
The parish council is responsible for some local issues, and sets an annual precept (local rate) to cover its council&#x27;s operating costs. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council also initiates projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, and consults with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. Having previously been part of Street Urban District, the parish was within the non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, until it was abolished on 31 March 2023. 

Somerset Council is the unitary authority responsible for the area. The Street electoral division has the same boundaries as the parish, and elects two councillors.

Street is in the Glastonbury and Somerton parliamentary constituency, which elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system. The current MP is Sarah Dyke, elected in 2024 for the Liberal Democrats.

Street is twinned with Isny im Allgäu, a town in south-eastern Baden-Württemberg (Germany), and Notre Dame de Gravenchon in Normandy, France. Both twinnings are announced on the signs that welcome visitors to Street.

==Geography==

The River Brue marks the boundary with Glastonbury, to the north of Street. At the time of King Arthur, the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it was here that Sir Bedivere is thought to have thrown the sword Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann. The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.

Before the 13th century, the direct route to the sea at Highbridge was blocked by gravel banks and peat near Westhay. The course of the river partially encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River Axe just north of Bleadney. This route made it difficult for the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the Abbey, and when the valley of the river Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Sometime between 1230 and 1250, a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project based on the Somerset Levels and Moors and managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust.

The Walton and Ivythorn Hills biological Site of Special Scientific Interest south of the village lies at the end of the Polden Hills. This site is owned and managed by the National Trust. Walton and Ivythorn Hills support a complex mosaic of semi-natural habitats which includes unimproved calcareous grassland, dense and scattered scrub and broadleaved woodland. Structural diversity within the habitats, together with the extensive areas of sheltered wood-edge and scrub-edge margins provide ideal conditions for many species of invertebrate. Butterflies, leafhoppers, spiders and soldier flies are particularly well represented. The great green bush cricket
(&quot;Tettigonia viridissima&quot;) is also of interest. It is adjacent to the East Polden Grasslands which has typical examples of species-rich, unimproved, calcareous grassland with scrub and amongst the many plant species found in this habitat is the early gentian (&quot;Gentianella anglica&quot;), which is endemic to Britain. Its other main interest lies in its suitability as a habitat for the large blue butterfly (&quot;Phengaris arion&quot;), which has been successfully reintroduced onto the site. There are two nationally scarce grasshopper species present; rufous grasshopper (&quot;Gomphocerippus rufus&quot;) and woodland grasshopper (&quot;Omocestus rufipes&quot;). Several nationally scarce species of moth, beetle, bee and ant also occur.

Street Heath is a nature reserve, managed by Somerset Wildlife Trust, and has outstanding examples of communities which were once common on the Somerset Levels. The vegetation consists of wet and dry heath, species-rich bog and carr woodland, with transitions between all these habitats. Rare ferns present include marsh fern (&quot;Thelypteris palustris&quot;) and royal fern (&quot;Osmunda regalis&quot;). Old peat workings and rhynes have a wetland community which includes bulrush (&quot;Typha latifolia&quot;), yellow flag iris (&quot;pseudacorus&quot;), cyperus-like sedge (&quot;Carex pseudocyperus&quot;) and lesser bur-reed (&quot;Sparganium natans&quot;). Insects recorded include 33 species of butterflies, 200 moths and 12 grasshoppers and crickets, with several notable rarities. Birds breeding in the carr woodland include the local willow tit
Merriman Park is named after Nathaniel James Merriman (1809-1882). He was Curate then Vicar of Street, until he emigrated to South Africa. He rose to become Archdeacon of Grahamstown then Dean of Cape Town before being elevated the Episcopate.

===Climate===
Along with the rest of South West England, Street has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==C. and J. Clark Ltd==

The Society of Friends established itself here in the mid-17th century, and among the close-knit group of Quaker families were the Clarks: Cyrus Clark started a business in sheepskin rugs, later joined by his brother James, who introduced the production of woollen slippers and then boots and shoes. Under James&#x27;s son, William, the business flourished, and most of the profits were ploughed back into employee welfare, housing and education.

C&amp;J Clark still has its headquarters in Street, behind a frontage that includes the clock tower and water tower, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom. Despite strong concerns being voiced by local retailers at the time, the retail outlets have not led to a demise of the existing shops. The Shoe Museum provides information about the history of Clarks and footwear manufacture in general, and a selection of shop display showcards from the 1930s, the 1950s and the 1960s, and television advertisements.

The Clark family mansion and its estate at the edge of the village are now owned by Millfield School. The company, through the Society of Friends, also had its own small sanatorium and convalescent home on Ivythorn Hill overlooking the village. In 1931, the chalet-style building was leased to the Youth Hostel Association and became the first youth hostel in Somerset. It is still used for this purpose.

==Transport==
In Roman times Street was close to the route of the Fosse Way and is now on the route of the modern A39 road which runs from Bath to Cornwall, and the A361.

Glastonbury and Street railway station was the biggest station on the original Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway main line from Highbridge to Evercreech Junction until closed in 1966 under the Beeching axe. Opened in 1854 as Glastonbury, and renamed in 1886, it had three platforms, two for Evercreech to Highbridge services and one for the branch service to Wells. The station had a large goods yard controlled from a signal box. The nearest stations are now around 9 miles away, at Castle Cary and Bridgwater. Replica level crossing gates have been placed at the old station entrance.

A number of bus services serve Street including route 376 to Bristol via Wells which is operated by First West of England and runs every hour. It is also served by Berrys Coaches daily &#x27;Superfast&#x27; service to and from London.

==Education==
Primary infant/junior schools include Avalon, Brookside, Hindhayes, and Elmhurst.

Crispin School is a secondary school teaching 11- to 16-year-old students from Street and many local villages. It has 1084 students between the ages of 11 and 16 years enrolled. In 1997 it became the first Beacon School in Somerset. It is a Technology College and has a second specialism as a Language College. The school shares its campus with Strode College, a tertiary institution and further education college which provides education for 16+ students after they leave secondary school, these courses are usually A-levels or Business and Technology Education Councils (BTECs). The college also provides education for older/mature students, and provides some university level courses. The college is part of The University of Plymouth Colleges network.

At the edge of village is Millfield School, an independent co-educational boarding school which currently caters for 1,260 pupils, of which 910 are boarders. It was founded in 1935 by Boss Meyer, in the house and grounds originally owned by the Clark family, who owned and ran the major shoe manufacturer Clarks.

==Sport and leisure==
Street has a Non-League football club Street F.C. who play at The Tannery.
Street has two public swimming pools, one indoor and one outdoor. The indoor pool forms part of the Strode complex. The outdoor pool, Greenbank, is open daily from early May until mid September each year.

The only single use cinema in Street was closed down and converted into a nightclub in the 1990s. Strode Theatre, linked to the Crispin School and Strode College complex, is now the only place to see films, exhibitions and live performances. It opened on 5 October 1963 with a performance by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In 1999 the theatre was expanded with a new foyer, bar and box office along with improved rehearsal space and stage access, at a cost of £750,000 by the Steel, Coleman Davis partnership who received an award for the design. The expansion was funded by the Arts Council England.

The village is on the route of the Samaritans Way South West.

==Religious sites==

The Anglican Parish Church of The Holy Trinity dates from the 14th century but underwent extensive restoration in the 19th century. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The chancel pre dates the rest of the building, having been built about 1270. The first recorded Rector was John de Hancle in 1304. The parish is linked with Street Mission Church in Vestry Road and the church in Walton. There is also a Baptist church on Glaston Road.

<doc id="235342" wikidata="Q1139514" url="?curid=235342" title="USS Ponce (LPD-15)">
<text>USS &quot;Ponce&quot; (AFSB(I)-15) (formerly LPD-15) ( ), was an , formerly in service with the United States Navy.
She has been the only ship of the Navy named for Ponce in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which in turn was named after the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León, the first governor of Puerto Rico and the European discoverer of Florida. Her keel was laid down on 31 October 1966 by the Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company of Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 20 May 1970 sponsored by Florence W. Hyland, the wife of Admiral John J. Hyland, and commissioned on 10 July 1971. She spent most of her career based on the East Coast and operating in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, serving in Operation Desert Shield and supporting US operations in the 2011 Libyan Civil War.

It was intended that the ship would be decommissioned in 2012, but she gained a reprieve to be converted at short notice into a testbed for the Afloat Forward Staging Base (AFSB) concept, in which she would act as a base for mine-sweeping MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters in the Persian Gulf. Following the conversion, &quot;Ponce&quot; had been used to test other initiatives and technologies, such as the Laser Weapon System and operating US Army attack helicopters at sea. After the arrival of as a permanent AFSB (now designated as Expeditionary Mobile Base (ESB)), &quot;Ponce&quot; was decommissioned in October 2017 after 46 years of service and 27 deployments.

==Ship history==
===1980s===
On 2 February 1982, during a towing exercise while en route to Portsmouth, England, &quot;Ponce&quot; collided with , causing minor damage to &quot;Ponce&quot;″s port side, mainly to the accommodation ladder and flight deck catwalk.

On 14 February 1984, while attempting to bring an assault craft into the welldeck, near Morehead City, North Carolina, &quot;Ponce&quot; suffered major damage when her stern gate was damaged and eventually lost. She was later repaired in Philadelphia. Following the stern gate repairs, &quot;Ponce&quot; resumed her deployment, successfully loading the Marines and equipment off North Carolina&#x27;s shores and heading for the Mediterranean, where she served as part of a multinational peacekeeping force, patrolling the shore off Beirut, Lebanon in the wake of the attack on the Marine barracks the previous October.

===1990s===
On 5 August 1990, as part of Operation Sharp Edge to remove US citizens caught up in the civil war in Liberia, &quot;Ponce&quot;, together with , , and , inserted a United States Marine Corps reinforced rifle company into the U.S. Embassy compound in Monrovia for increased security.

From June to December 1991, &quot;Ponce&quot; completed a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea, and was part of Operation Desert Shield and supported Operation Desert Storm.

In the first half of 1992, &quot;Ponce&quot; completed a four-month maintenance availability in Norfolk, Virginia. In June, she took on midshipmen for a training cruise off the Virginia Capes, which earned her the &quot;CORTRAMID &#x27;92 Surface Warrior of the Week&quot;. In September, she arrived in Miami for Hurricane Andrew relief efforts. In October, she commenced counter drug operations in the Caribbean with a United States Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment on board.

On 17 March 1993, &quot;Ponce&quot; departed on a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit in support of Operations &quot;Deny Flight&quot; and &quot;Provide Promise&quot;. She was accompanied by USS &quot;Saipan&quot; and . During the deployment, she operated bilaterally with Greek units in exercise &quot;Alexandros &#x27;93&quot; and conducted amphibious landing exercises with the Tunisians in &quot;Phiblex &#x27;93&quot;.

In April, 1996, operating with elements of the 22d Marine Expeditionary Unit - Special Operations Capable [MEU (SOC)] and the USS Carter Hall (LSD-50), the Ponce sailed from North Carolina independent of the &quot;big deck&quot; (USS Kearsarge, LHD-3), that was operating off the west coast of Africa, in support of a Non-Combatant Operation (NEO). Along with the Carter Hall, the Ponce supported all 11 of the LF6F 2-97 tasking, including conducting embassy reinforcements during Operation Silver Wake in Albania, following unrest in the capital. Supporting 4 CH-46E Sea Knight and 2 UH-1 helicopters during the entire deployment, the Ponce entered the Black Sea through the Bosphorus Strait and conducted Exercise Cooperative Partner in Bulgaria, marking the first time a combined Navy-Marine Corps task force had operated in the former Soviet Bloc country. A second trip to the Black Sea saw the Ponce participate in Exercise Rescue Eagle in Romania and Exercise Sea Breeze in Ukraine. Following Exercise Dynamic Mix in Greece, Ponce and Carter Hall returned to the East Coast in October, 1996, concluding the entire deployment as a two-ship Amphibious Ready Group. 

===2000s===
On 27 April 2001, &quot;Ponce&quot; commenced a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean, returning to Norfolk on 15 October. On 29 August 2001, &quot;Ponce&quot; crewmembers boarded two derelict Italian boats, a motorboat and a sailboat, in the Straits of Messina between Sicily and Calabria. The civilian vessels were adrift, creating a navigational hazard. A boarding party in a rigid hull inflatable boat found both derelicts unmanned, though the motorboat was well stocked. They towed both boats back to &quot;Ponce&quot;, which flooded her welldeck, brought the boats aboard, carried them into Catania, and turned them over to the &quot;Guardia Costiera&quot; (Italian Coast Guard).

On 10 January 2003, &quot;Ponce&quot; received orders to depart Norfolk, Virginia and take on Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. That duty kept &quot;Ponce&quot; at sea through February. At the end of February, she became the flagship of the Commander of Mine Countermeasure Squadron Three, designated as Commander, Task Group 55.4. The Task Group included a US Navy special clearance team, two explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) units, a detachment of MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters from Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron Fourteen (HM-14), a British unit and an Australian team. The ships involved included the coastal mine hunters and , mine countermeasure ships and , and dock landing ship .
After breaking the Squadron&#x27;s pennant at her yardarm, the crews of &quot;Ponce&quot; and &quot;Gunston Hall&quot; enjoyed liberty ashore in Manama, Bahrain, from 28 February to 5 March. She then served as Task Group flagship for a weeks-long minesweeping operation in Iraq, as humanitarian aid was being blocked by naval mines in the Khawr Abd Allah river and the port of Umm Qasr. The Group used a variety of methods, including MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters towing magnetic minesweeping sleds, trained marine mammals, unmanned underwater vehicles and EOD divers. On 28 March 2003, a -wide channel was declared safe, and the British auxiliary vessel docked at Umm Qasr Port and began offloading hundreds of tons of food and water. Work continued for weeks after that, widening the channel.

On 25 March 2005, &quot;Ponce&quot; again departed Norfolk, deploying with the Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) for six months. Following a port visit to Augusta Bay, Sicily, &quot;Ponce&quot; spent three months in the Persian Gulf conducting operations in support of the global War on Terrorism. While in the Persian Gulf, she made port visits to Bahrain and Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates. &quot;Ponce&quot; departed the Persian Gulf in August 2005. On 19 August, &quot;Ponce&quot; was in the Gulf of Aqaba awaiting the underway movement of to allow &quot;Ponce&quot; to dock pier side. While &quot;Ashland&quot; was in the process, the Katyusha rocket attack occurred on USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; and &quot;Ashland&quot;. &quot;Ponce&quot; remained in the Gulf of Aqaba for over a week in response to the attack. She then conducted port visits to Malta and Rota, Spain, before returning to Norfolk on 27 September.

===2010s===

On 2 March 2011, &quot;Ponce&quot;, along with &quot;Kearsarge&quot;, traveled through the Suez Canal in response to the 2011 Libyan civil war.

On 23 April 2011, Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet (C6F) relieved &quot;Ponce&quot;″s commanding and executive officers, as a result of a hazing inquiry. Vice Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr., relieved commanding officer (CO) Commander Etta Jones, due to a demonstration of poor leadership and failure to appropriately investigate, report, and hold accountable sailors found involved in hazing incidents. Additionally, she failed to properly handle a loaded weapon during a security alert, which endangered some of her ship&#x27;s crew. The relief of the executive officer (XO), Lieutenant Commander Kurt Boenisch, was attributed to his failure to provide support to the command and to his commanding officer.

On 26 October 2011, &quot;Ponce&quot; began a three-week tour that would take her to Port Canaveral, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and her namesake city of Ponce, Puerto Rico. On her return to Norfolk, in December 2011, she was to begin the process of decommissioning. On 2 December 2011, &quot;Ponce&quot; came home to await decommissioning, scheduled for 30 March 2012, when she would be towed to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, and put in reserve status. In January 2012, in response to requests from United States Central Command, it was decided that she would be retrofitted and re-deployed as the first of a planned series of mine-countermeasures warships for use in keeping open strategic sea lanes.

===Afloat Forward Staging Base, Interim (AFSB-I)===
On 24 January 2012, Military Sealift Command (MSC) posted a bid request to retrofit USS &quot;Ponce&quot; on a rush-order basis. MSC issued requests for proposal to upgrade and refit the ship. The work included upgrading the ship&#x27;s navigation systems, bringing habitability up to MSC standards and general refurbishment. The ship was expected to be completely transformed in an estimated four to five months, and the target date for re-deployment to her new role was met.

&quot;Ponce&quot; was re-designated from LPD-15 to AFSB(I)-15 (Afloat Forward Staging Base and &quot;I&quot; for &quot;interim&quot;, until purpose-built vessels came on line in 2015), and she was modified to support mine-sweeping MH-53 Sea Dragon helicopters and small mine-clearance vessels.
 The ship was operated jointly by active-duty Navy officers and sailors, as well as being crewed by government civilian mariners from Military Sealift Command, some of whom were more than 60 years old.

The ship served in the Persian Gulf as the Pentagon&#x27;s first floating staging base for military operations or humanitarian assistance. It was later reported that, despite the capability to do so, &quot;Ponce&quot; would not be a mothership for special operations, but rather a &quot;lilypad&quot; for MH-53E helicopters in a mine-clearance role, as well as for patrol and mine-clearance craft. As Admiral John Harvey stated, &quot;The topic was a hot one, and people read these [documents] we generate very closely. I think they put two and two together and got 22.&quot;

On 1 June 2012, &quot;Ponce&quot;, in her new role as AFSB, deployed to the Fifth Fleet area in the Middle East, and on 22 June 2012 she passed through the Suez Canal on her way to Bahrain, arriving there on 5 July. She then participated in International Mine Countermeasures Exercise 2012 (IMCMEX 2012) between 16 and 27 September 2012, demonstrating the capabilities her &quot;stop-gap&quot; role was intended to fill.

On 29 October 2012, &quot;Ponce&quot; rescued seven Bahraini fishermen whose vessel was foundering in a hailstorm.

In 2013, &quot;Ponce&quot; functioned as the operational center and HQ for the International Mine Countermeasures Exercise in the Persian Gulf, using the berthing designed for transporting marines in order to function as a floating &quot;hotel&quot; for the operation.

In October 2016, &quot;Ponce&quot; was subjected to missile fire ostensibly launched from Yemen by Houthi rebels.

In August 2017, &quot;Ponce&quot; was replaced in the AFSB role by &quot;Lewis B. Puller&quot; (ESB-3), and in mid-2017, both ships briefly operated together. With the role of AFSB permanently taken over, the ship returned to port at Norfolk, Virginia on 27 September 2017.

===Laser weapon tests===

&quot;Ponce&quot; became the testbed platform for the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System (LaWS), with installation of a prototype weapon system for field testing in August 2014. In December 2014 the Navy reported the LaWS system worked perfectly, and that the commander of &quot;Ponce&quot; was authorized to use the system as a defensive weapon. On 9 December 2014, the Navy released video footage of the LaWS in operation, and while the operating power is unknown, it is estimated to be in the range of 15–50 Kilowatt (kW) for engaging drones, small aircraft and high-speed boats.

&quot;Ponce&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf with the laser in late August 2014, and the LaWS remained in use until 2017; at which point, &quot;Ponce&quot; was decommissioned and the LaWS was moved to .

==Possible sale to Argentina==
In 2017, it was reported that Argentina was interested in acquiring &quot;Ponce&quot; as an addition to their Navy. It was reported that talks of purchase began while US Vice President Mike Pence was on a state visit to Argentina and met with Argentine President, Mauricio Macri. Such a purchase would restore amphibious assault capability to the Argentine Navy, which it has not had since 1997, with the decommissioning of tank landing ship, . In response to these reports, the United Kingdom has expressed concern that said purchase would give Argentina a way to invade the Falkland Islands once again, and if purchased, the Royal Navy would have to increase its presence in the Falkland Islands. The Navy has since announced that &quot;Ponce&quot; will be dismantled following her decommissioning, likely negating any possibility of a sale.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Ponce&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Station Norfolk on 14 October 2017 and moved to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where it was laid up.

On 24 March 2022, &quot;Ponce&quot; was removed from the Philadelphia NIMSF and began its journey to Brownsville, Texas, where it will be scrapped. It arrived in Brownsville on 12 April 2022.

<doc id="235343" wikidata="Q132298" url="?curid=235343" title="Potassium hydroxide">
<text>Potassium hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula KOH, and is commonly called caustic potash.

Along with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), KOH is a prototypical strong base. It has many industrial and niche applications, most of which utilize its nature and its reactivity toward acids. An estimated 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes were produced in 2005. KOH is noteworthy as the precursor to most soft and liquid soaps, as well as numerous potassium-containing chemicals. It is a white solid that is dangerously corrosive.

==Properties and structure==
KOH exhibits high thermal stability. Because of this high stability and relatively low melting point, it is often melt-cast as pellets or rods, forms that have low surface area and convenient handling properties. These pellets become tacky in air because KOH is hygroscopic. Most commercial samples are ca. 90% pure, the remainder being water and carbonates. Its dissolution in water is strongly exothermic. Concentrated aqueous solutions are sometimes called potassium lyes. Even at high temperatures, solid KOH does not dehydrate readily.

===Structure===
At higher temperatures, solid KOH crystallizes in the NaCl crystal structure. The group is either rapidly or randomly disordered so that it is effectively a spherical anion of radius 1.53 Å (between and in size). At room temperature, the groups are ordered and the environment about the centers is distorted, with distances ranging from 2.69 to 3.15 Å, depending on the orientation of the OH group. KOH forms a series of crystalline hydrates, namely the monohydrate , the dihydrate and the tetrahydrate .

==Reactions==
===Solubility and desiccating properties===
About 112 g of KOH dissolve in 100 mL water at room temperature, which contrasts with 100 g/100 mL for NaOH. Thus on a molar basis, KOH is slightly more soluble than NaOH. Lower molecular-weight alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and propanols are also excellent solvents. They participate in an acid-base equilibrium. In the case of methanol the potassium methoxide (methylate) forms:

Because of its high affinity for water, KOH serves as a desiccant in the laboratory. It is often used to dry basic solvents, especially amines and pyridines.

===As a nucleophile in organic chemistry===
KOH, like NaOH, serves as a source of , a highly nucleophilic anion that attacks polar bonds in both inorganic and organic materials. Aqueous KOH saponifies esters:

When R is a long chain, the product is called a potassium soap. This reaction is manifested by the &quot;greasy&quot; feel that KOH gives when touched; fats on the skin are rapidly converted to soap and glycerol.

Molten KOH is used to displace halides and other leaving groups. The reaction is especially useful for aromatic reagents to give the corresponding phenols.

===Reactions with inorganic compounds===
Complementary to its reactivity toward acids, KOH attacks oxides. Thus, SiO2 is attacked by KOH to give soluble potassium silicates. KOH reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium bicarbonate:

==Manufacture==
Historically, KOH was made by adding potassium carbonate to a strong solution of calcium hydroxide (slaked lime). The salt metathesis reaction results in precipitation of solid calcium carbonate, leaving potassium hydroxide in solution:

Filtering off the precipitated calcium carbonate and boiling down the solution gives potassium hydroxide (&quot;calcinated or caustic potash&quot;). This method of producing potassium hydroxide remained dominant until the late 19th century, when it was largely replaced by the current method of electrolysis of potassium chloride solutions. The method is analogous to the manufacture of sodium hydroxide (see chloralkali process):

Hydrogen gas forms as a byproduct on the cathode; concurrently, an anodic oxidation of the chloride ion takes place, forming chlorine gas as a byproduct. Separation of the anodic and cathodic spaces in the electrolysis cell is essential for this process.

==Uses==
KOH and NaOH can be used interchangeably for a number of applications, although in industry, NaOH is preferred because of its lower cost.

=== Catalyst for hydrothermal gasification process ===
In industry, KOH is a good catalyst for hydrothermal gasification process. In this process, it is used to improve the yield of gas and amount of hydrogen in process. For example, production of coke (fuel) from coal often produces much coking wastewater. In order to degrade it, supercritical water is used to convert it to the syngas containing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Using pressure swing adsorption, we could separate various gases and then use power-to-gas technology to convert them to fuel. On the other hand, the hydrothermal gasification process could degrade other waste such as sewage sludge and waste from food factories.

===Precursor to other potassium compounds===
Many potassium salts are prepared by neutralization reactions involving KOH. The potassium salts of carbonate, cyanide, permanganate, phosphate, and various silicates are prepared by treating either the oxides or the acids with KOH. The high solubility of potassium phosphate is desirable in fertilizers.

===Manufacture of soft soaps===
The saponification of fats with KOH is used to prepare the corresponding &quot;potassium soaps&quot;, which are softer than the more common sodium hydroxide-derived soaps. Because of their softness and greater solubility, potassium soaps require less water to liquefy, and can thus contain more cleaning agent than liquefied sodium soaps.

===As an electrolyte===

Aqueous potassium hydroxide is employed as the electrolyte in alkaline batteries based on nickel-cadmium, nickel-hydrogen, and manganese dioxide-zinc. Potassium hydroxide is preferred over sodium hydroxide because its solutions are more conductive. The nickel–metal hydride batteries in the Toyota Prius use a mixture of potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. Nickel–iron batteries also use potassium hydroxide electrolyte.

===Food industry===
In food products, potassium hydroxide acts as a food thickener, pH control agent and food stabilizer. The FDA considers it generally safe as a direct food ingredient when used in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices. It is known in the E number system as E525.

===Niche applications===
Like sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide attracts numerous specialized applications, virtually all of which rely on its properties as a strong chemical base with its consequent ability to degrade many materials. For example, in a process commonly referred to as &quot;chemical cremation&quot; or &quot;resomation&quot;, potassium hydroxide hastens the decomposition of soft tissues, both animal and human, to leave behind only the bones and other hard tissues. Entomologists wishing to study the fine structure of insect anatomy may use a 10% aqueous solution of KOH to apply this process.

In chemical synthesis, the choice between the use of KOH and the use of NaOH is guided by the solubility or keeping quality of the resulting salt.

The corrosive properties of potassium hydroxide make it a useful ingredient in agents and preparations that clean and disinfect surfaces and materials that can themselves resist corrosion by KOH.

KOH is also used for semiconductor chip fabrication (for example anisotropic wet etching).

Potassium hydroxide is often the main active ingredient in chemical &quot;cuticle removers&quot; used in manicure treatments.

Because aggressive bases like KOH damage the cuticle of the hair shaft, potassium hydroxide is used to chemically assist the removal of hair from animal hides. The hides are soaked for several hours in a solution of KOH and water to prepare them for the unhairing stage of the tanning process. This same effect is also used to weaken human hair in preparation for shaving. Preshave products and some shave creams contain potassium hydroxide to force open the hair cuticle and to act as a hygroscopic agent to attract and force water into the hair shaft, causing further damage to the hair. In this weakened state, the hair is more easily cut by a razor blade.

Potassium hydroxide is used to identify some species of fungi. A 3–5% aqueous solution of KOH is applied to the flesh of a mushroom and the researcher notes whether or not the color of the flesh changes. Certain species of gilled mushrooms, boletes, polypores, and lichens are identifiable based on this color-change reaction.

==Safety==
Potassium hydroxide is a caustic alkali and its solutions range from irritating to skin and other tissue in low concentrations, to highly corrosive in high concentrations. Eyes are particularly vulnerable, and dust or mist is severely irritating to lungs and can cause pulmonary edema. Safety considerations are similar to those of sodium hydroxide.

The caustic effects arise from being highly alkaline, but if potassium hydroxide is neutralised with a non-toxic acid then it becomes a non-toxic potassium salt. It is approved as a food additive under the code E525.

<text>Tulita, which in Slavey means &quot;where the rivers or waters meet&quot;, is a hamlet in the Sahtu Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. It was formerly known as &quot;Fort Norman&quot;, until 1 January 1996. It is located at the junction of the Great Bear River and the Mackenzie River; the Bear originates at Great Bear Lake adjacent to Deline.

Tulita is in an area that is forested and well south of the tree line. Permafrost underlays the area, more or less continuous in distribution. Tulita is surrounded by mountains, the latter renowned for Dall sheep, and faces the Mackenzie Mountains to the west, which has mountain goats.

== History ==
Fort Norman originated as a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post in the 19th century and has occupied a number of geographical locations prior to the settling of the modern community. A post by the name of Fort Norman occupied several locations, on the Mackenzie River, on the islands within it, on Bear River, and on the shore of Great Bear Lake near the present location of Deline. Who the name &#x27;Norman&#x27; commemorates is unclear, but it may have been either Alexander Norman McLeod or Archibald Norman McLeod, both of whom were prominent in the northwest in the early 19th century.

Between 1863 and 1869, Fort Norman was located on Great Bear Lake, a short distance west of what later became Deline (Fort Franklin), and was an HBC post commanded by Nichol Taylor. Roman Catholic missionary Émile Petitot operated a small mission here during that period. In 1869, Nichol Taylor moved Fort Norman to its present position at the confluence of the Mackenzie and Bear Rivers.

Fort Norman rose to importance during the 1920s oil staking rush along the Mackenzie River, downstream of the community, where oil was developed and marketed at what became known as Norman Wells. It has also become a permanent settlement for predominately Sahtu Dene people on whose traditional land the original trading post was built. In 1996, the name of Fort Norman was officially changed to Tulita, which translates in Dene to &quot;where the rivers or waters meet.&quot;

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Tulita had a population of 396 living in of its 160 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 477. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2016, the majority of the population was Indigenous being First Nations and Métis. The main languages are North Slavey and English with some Dene.

== Transport and tourism ==

Tulita may be reached via air year-round, and is served by Tulita Airport; Norman Wells is the regional centre and the site of origin of the majority of flights in. A winter road links Tulita to Wrigley and thence the Mackenzie Highway, and is only open in mid- to late winter. Summer access is available by barge or by canoe, from Hay River along the Mackenzie River. The NWT government is seeking federal funding to extend the Mackenzie Highway from Wrigley through Tulita to Tsiigehtchic.

Amenities consist of a hotel, Northern Store, Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment, and a nursing station. Chief Albert Wright School teaches grades K-12 while the hamlet has a library, arena, recreation hall, and fitness centre.

==First Nations==

The Dene First Nations people of Tulita are represented by the Tulita Dene First Nation, a band government operating within the community. The TDFN is a member of the Sahtu Dene Council, joining the Behdzi Ahda&#x27; First Nation, Délı̨nę First Nation, and Fort Good Hope First Nation.

Treaty Indians from the community are party to the Sahtu Agreement, which gives them shared title to 41,437 square kilometers of land in the Sahtu Region. Under the Sahtu Agreement, self-government negotiations are ongoing in all five of the region&#x27;s communities, but as of 2019 only Délı̨nę has successfully reached a Final Agreement.

==Notable people==
*Leslie Nielsen lived here while his father was stationed with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

==Climate==
Tulita experiences a subarctic climate (Koppen: Dfc) with generally mild to warm summers and cold winters with highs often well-below zero. Peak snowfall occurs in the months of October and November, while rainfall is limited to the warmer months.
==In literature==
* The outpost of Fort Norman features in James A. Michener&#x27;s novel Journey in which the character of Lord Luton seeks information there in the winter of 1897.

<text>A tent is a shelter consisting of sheets of fabric or other material draped over or attached to a frame of poles or a supporting rope. While smaller tents may be free-standing or attached to the ground, large tents are usually anchored using guy ropes tied to stakes or tent pegs. First used as portable homes by nomads, tents are now more often used for recreational camping and as temporary shelters.

Tents range in size from &quot;bivouac&quot; structures, just big enough for one person to sleep in, up to huge circus tents capable of seating thousands of people. Tents for recreational camping fall into two categories. Tents intended to be carried by backpackers are the smallest and lightest type. Small tents may be sufficiently light that they can be carried for long distances on a touring bicycle, a boat, or when backpacking. The second type are larger, heavier tents which are usually carried in a car or other vehicle. Depending on tent size and the experience of the person or people involved, such tents can usually be assembled (pitched) in between 5 and 25 minutes; disassembly (striking) takes a similar length of time. Some very specialised tents have spring-loaded poles and can be pitched in seconds, but take somewhat longer to strike (take down and pack).

Over the past decade, tents have also been increasingly linked with homelessness crises in the United States, Canada, and other regions. Places of multiple homeless people living in tents closely pitched or plotted near each other are often referred to as tent cities.

== History ==
A form of tent called a teepee or tipi, noted for its cone shape and peak smoke hole, was also used by Native American tribes and Aboriginal Canadians of the Plains Indians since ancient times, variously estimated from 10,000 to 4,000 years BC.

Tents were used at least as far back as the early Iron Age. They are mentioned in the Bible; for example, in Genesis 4:20 Jabal is described as &quot;the first to live in tents and raise sheep and goats&quot;. The Roman Army used leather tents, copies of which have been used successfully by modern re-enactors. Various styles developed over time, some derived from traditional nomadic tents, such as the yurt.

Most military tents throughout history were of a simple ridge design. The major technological advance was the use of linen or hemp canvas for the canopy versus leather for the Romans. The primary use of tents was still to provide portable shelter for a small number of men in the field.

By World War I larger designs were being deployed in rear areas to provide shelter for support activities and supplies.
Four types of tents which can be characterized by their unique shapes are A-Frame tents, Pyramid tents, Hoop tents , and Dome tents. tents tend not to be very spacious, given their ground surface area.

== Use ==
Tents are used as habitation by nomads, recreational campers, soldiers, and disaster victims. Pole marquees, a type of large tent are typically used as overhead shelter for festivals, weddings, backyard parties, corporate events, excavation (construction) covers, and industrial shelters.

=== Traditional ===

Tents have traditionally been used by nomadic people all over the world, such as Native Americans, Mongolian, Turkic and Tibetan Nomads, and the Bedouin.

=== Military ===
Armies all over the world have long used tents as part of their working life. Tents are preferred by the military for their relatively quick setup and take down times, compared to more traditional shelters. One of the world&#x27;s largest users of tents is the U.S. Department of Defense. The U.S. DoD has strict rules on tent quality and tent specifications. The most common tent uses for the military are temporary sleeping quarters (barracks); dining facilities (DFACs); field headquarters; morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) facilities; and security checkpoints. One of the most popular military designs currently fielded is the TEMPER Tent, an acronym for Tent Expandable Modular PERsonnel. The United States Army is beginning to use a more modern tent called the deployable rapid assembly shelter or DRASH, a collapsible tent with provisions for air conditioning and heating.

=== Recreational ===
Camping is a popular form of recreation which often involves the use of tents. A tent is economical and practical because of its portability and low environmental impact. These qualities are necessary when used in the wilderness or backcountry.

=== Emergency ===

Tents are often used in humanitarian emergencies, such as war, earthquakes and fire. The primary choice of tents in humanitarian emergencies are canvas tents, because a cotton canvas tent allows functional breathability while serving the purpose of temporary shelter. Tents distributed by organisations such as UNHCR are made by various manufacturers, depending on the region where the tents are deployed, as well as depending on the purpose.

At times, however, these temporary shelters become a permanent or semi-permanent home, especially for displaced people living in refugee camps or shanty towns who can not return to their former home and for whom no replacement homes are made available.

====Homelessness====
Tents have been increasingly used as shelter for homeless people in the U.S., especially California, Oregon, and Washington. Encampments spiked in the mid-to-late 2010s. These tent cities housing many homeless and travelers/vagabonds have also, are also commonly found in major cities in the South, including Austin, Texas, which had passed a restriction on homeless encampments in May 2021.

=== Protest movements ===
Tents are also often used as sites and symbols of protest over time. In 1968 Resurrection City saw hundreds of tents set up by anti-poverty campaigners in Washington D.C. In the 1970s and 1980s anti-nuclear peace camps spread across Europe and North America, with the largest women&#x27;s-only camp to date set up outside the RAF Greenham Common United States airbase in Newbury, England to protest the deployment there of cruise missiles during the Cold War. The 1990s saw environmental protest camps as part of the campaign for the Clayoquot Sound in Canada and the roads protests in the UK. The first No Border Network camp was held in Strasbourg in 2002, becoming the first in a series of international camps that continue to be organised today. Other international camps of the 2000s include summit counter-mobilisations like Horizone at the Gleneagles G8 gathering in 2005 and the start of Camp for Climate Action in 2006. Since September 2011, the tent has been used as a symbol of the Occupy movement, an international protest movement which is primarily directed against economic and social inequality. Occupy protesters use tents to create camps in public places wherein they can form communities of open discussion and democratic action.

== General considerations ==
Generally, the interior of an enclosed tent is about 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the outside environment (not accounting for wind chill), due to the retention of body heat and (to a lesser extent) radiation.

Tent fabric may be made of many materials including cotton (canvas), nylon, felt and polyester. Cotton absorbs water, so it can become very heavy when wet, but the associated swelling tends to block any minute holes so that wet cotton is more waterproof than dry cotton. Cotton tents were often treated with paraffin to enhance water resistance. Nylon and polyester are much lighter than cotton and do not absorb much water; with suitable coatings they can be very waterproof, but they tend to deteriorate over time due to a slow chemical breakdown caused by ultraviolet light. The most common treatments to make fabric waterproof are silicone impregnation or polyurethane coating. Since stitching makes tiny holes in a fabric seams are often sealed or taped to block these holes and maintain waterproofness, though in practice a carefully sewn seam can be waterproof.

Rain resistance is measured and expressed as hydrostatic head in millimetres (mm). This indicates the pressure of water needed to penetrate a fabric. Heavy or wind-driven rain has a higher pressure than light rain. Standing on a groundsheet increases the pressure on any water underneath. Fabric with a hydrostatic head rating of 1000 mm or less is best regarded as shower resistant, with 1500 mm being usually suitable for summer camping. Tents for year-round use generally have at least 2000 mm; expedition tents intended for extreme conditions are often rated at 3000 mm. Where quoted, groundsheets may be rated for 5000 mm or more.

Many tent manufacturers indicate capacity by such phrases as &quot;3 berth&quot; or &quot;2 person&quot;. These numbers indicate how many people the manufacturer thinks can use the tent, though these numbers do not always allow for any personal belongings, such as luggage, inflatable mattresses, camp beds, cots, etc., nor do they always allow for people who are of above average height. Checking the quoted sizes of sleeping areas reveals that several manufacturers consider that a width of is enough for three people; snug is the operative word. Experience indicates that camping may be more comfortable if the actual number of occupants is one or even two less than the manufacturer&#x27;s suggestion, though different manufacturers have different standards for space requirement and there is no accepted standard.

Tent used in areas with biting insects often have their vent and door openings covered with fine-mesh netting.

Tents can be improvised using waterproof fabric, string, and sticks.

== Parts ==
There are three basic configurations of tents, each of which may appear with many variations:

Single skin (USA: single wall): Only one waterproof layer of fabric is used, comprising at least roof and walls. To minimize condensation on the inside of the tent, some expedition tents use waterproof/breathable fabrics.

Single skin with flysheet: A waterproof &quot;flysheet&quot; or &quot;rain fly&quot; is suspended over and clear of the roof of the tent; it often overlaps the tent roof slightly, but does not extend down the sides or ends of the tent.

Double skin (USA: double wall): The &quot;outer tent&quot; is a waterproof layer which extends down to the ground all round. One or more &#x27;inner tents&#x27; provide sleeping areas. The outer tent may be just a little larger than the inner tent, or it may be a lot larger and provide a covered living area separate from the sleeping area(s). An inner tent is not waterproof, but allows water vapour to pass through so that condensation occurs only on the exterior side. The double layer may also provide some thermal insulation. Either the outer skin or the inner skin may be the structural component, carrying the poles; the structural skin is always pitched first, though some tents are built with the outer and inner linked so that they are both pitched at the same time.

Components:
* A &quot;flysheet&quot; or &quot;rain fly&quot; (found only in double skin tents) is used to protect the actual tent from water. A flysheet is waterproof on the outside and also provides a surface to collect condensation on the inside, which then runs down to the ground. When a flysheet is used, it is important that there be no contact with the inner tent it is protecting; this keeps the inner dry. &#x27;Expedition&#x27; tents often have extra poles to help ensure that wind does not blow the two layers into contact.
* The &quot;inner tent&quot; comprises the main living and sleeping area of the tent. For double skin tents, the inner tent (often mesh) is not waterproof since it is protected by the rain fly. For single skin tents, the inner tent is often made of waterproof-breathable material that prevents liquid water from penetrating the inside of the tent, but still allows water vapour to be transported out.
* The &quot;vestibule&quot; (they can be plural) is a floorless covered section located outside a tent entrance that is typically used for the storage of boots, packs, and other small equipment. Vestibules are often used for activities that are preferably not performed within the tent itself, such as cooking or equipment cleaning. Vestibules may be included as a removable attachment or integrated into the tent itself. Vestibule size varies considerably, ranging from extended areas with more surface than the inner tent down to practically nothing.
* A &quot;groundsheet&quot; is used to provide a waterproof barrier between the ground and a sleeping bag. With double skin tents, the inner tents normally have a sewn-in groundsheet, but a separate flat groundsheet may be provided for any living area. With single skin tents, the groundsheet may be sewn in or separate. Normal practice with sewn-in groundsheets is for the groundsheet to extend some up the lower part of the walls (sometimes called a &#x27;bathtub&#x27; arrangement); this copes with a situation where water seeps under the side walls of the tent. Separate groundsheets allow load-sharing when backpacking, and may make it easier to pitch and strike a tent, but they provide less protection against insects etc. getting into the sleeping area; also, if any part of a separate groundsheet protrudes from under the side walls, then it provides a ready path for moisture to flow into the tent.
* The &quot;poles&quot; provide structural support. They may be collapsible for easier transport and storage. Some designs use rigid poles, typically made of metal, or sometimes wood. Other designs use semi-rigid poles, typically made of fiberglass, or sometimes of special metal alloys. Another pole type uses inflatable beams as the structural support. Some tents, particularly very lightweight models, actually use hiking poles as their structural supports.
* &quot;Stakes&quot; (or &quot;tent pegs&quot;) or screws may be used to fasten the tent to the ground. Some are attached to &quot;guy ropes&quot; that pull outward on the poles and/or fabric to help shape the tent or give it additional stability. Others are used to anchor the bottom edge of the fabric to the ground. Pegs may be made of wood, plastic, or metal. A &quot;mallet&quot; may be needed to drive thicker pegs into the ground. &quot;Skewer&quot; metal pegs consisting essentially of a length of thick wire with a hook on one end can usually be inserted by hand, except if the ground is very hard, but may not be as strong as more substantial pegs. Pegs used for guy ropes should not be driven vertically into the ground; instead for maximum strength they should be driven in at an angle so that the peg is at right angles to the guy rope attached to it. Lighter free standing tents may need some guy ropes and pegs to prevent them from being blown away.
* &quot;Air vents&quot; help reduce the effects of condensation. When people breathe, they expel water vapour. If the outside of the tent is colder than the inside (the usual case), then this vapour will condense on the inside of the tent, on any clothing lying about, on the outside of a sleeping bag, etc. Hence ventilation helps to remove the vapour, although this may let in cold air.
* An optional tent &quot;footprint&quot; or &quot;groundsheet protector&quot; may be used. This is a separate flat groundsheet (tarp) which goes underneath the main groundsheet, and is slightly smaller than that groundsheet. The intention is to protect the main groundsheet, especially when camping on rough terrain, since it is much cheaper to replace a separate footprint groundsheet than it is to replace a sewn-in groundsheet.

== Design factors ==
Many factors affect tent design, including:
* &quot;Financial cost&quot;
**The least expensive tents tend to be heavier, less durable and less waterproof. The most expensive tents, used by serious backpackers and professional adventurers, are usually lighter in weight, more durable and more waterproof.
* &quot;Intended use&quot;
** Backpacking, lengthy duration for carrying the tent. Weight and size are the most crucial factors.
** Touring, high frequency of pitching and striking the tent. Ease of pitching/striking the tent is important.
** Static, staying at one campsite for a week or two at a time. A comfortable camping experience is the target.
* &quot;Camping season&quot;
*:A tent required only for summer use may be very different from one to be used in the depths of winter. Manufacturers label tents as one-season, two/three-season, three/four season, four season, etc. A one-season tent is generally for summer use only, and may only be capable of coping with light showers. A three-season tent is for spring/summer/autumn and should be capable of withstanding fairly heavy rain, or very light snow. A four-season tent should be suitable for winter camping in all but the most extreme conditions; an &quot;expedition&quot; tent (for mountain conditions) should be strong enough to cope with heavy snow, strong winds, as well as heavy rain. Some tents are sold, quite cheaply, as &quot;festival&quot; tents; these may be suitable only for camping in dry weather, and may not even be showerproof.
* &quot;Size of tent&quot;
** The number and age of people who will be camping determines how big and what features the sleeping area(s) must have.
** To allow for inclement weather, some covered living space separate from the sleeping area(s) may be desirable. Alternatively, cyclists on a camping trip may wish for enough covered space to keep their bicycles out of the weather.
** To allow for sunshine, an awning to provide shade may not go amiss. Some tents have additional poles so that the fabric doorways can be used as awnings.
** Internal height. Manufacturers quote the maximum internal height, but the usable internal height may be a little lower, depending on the tent style. Ridge tents have a steeply sloping roof so the whole height is rarely usable. Dome tents slope gently in all directions from the peak enabling nearly the entire height to be usable for a large portion of the tent. Tunnel tents have a good usable height along the center line. Frame and cabin tents have gently sloping roofs and near vertical walls. To fully evaluate the usable space in a tent, both the maximum wall height and slope must be considered. There are four useful heights used to evaluate appropriate tent height: lie down only, sit, kneel, stand. The exact heights at which these apply depend on the heights of the campers involved; those over are likely to have less choice of tents than those who are somewhat shorter. As a starting point, sitting height is often between , and kneeling height may be between . These different heights are useful for evaluating whether certain tasks, such as changing clothes, can be accomplished in the tent.
* &quot;Number of sleeping areas&quot;
*:Larger tents sometimes are partitioned into separate sleeping areas or rooms. A tent described as &quot;viz-a-viz (cabin tent)&quot; usually has two separate sleeping areas with a living area in between.
* &quot;Tent color&quot;
*:In some areas there is a move toward reducing the visual impact of campsites. The best colors for low visibility are green, brown, tan or khaki.
*:An opposing consideration is of safety and calls for visible unnatural colors, such as bright yellow-orange or red. Bright-colored tents can be easily spotted from the air in cases of an emergency. They are important in places where vehicles may not notice a low-visibility tent and run over its unsuspecting occupiers. Campers wandering away from camp will find their way back more easily if their tent is highly visible. Additionally, lost hikers may find rescue by spotting a visible camp site from afar. Some people have a personal preference for various colors and some manufacturers see the colors as part of their product branding.
* &quot;Setup effort&quot;
*:Some styles of camping and living outdoors entails quick setup of tents. As a general rule, the more robust the tent, the more time and effort needed to set up and dismantle, though specific design attention on quick setup (possibly in exchange for cost and/or weight) can alter that (for example, the Swedish manufacturer Hilleberg specify a design goal that their toughest tents should be easily pitched by a single camper in inclement weather while wearing mittens, but the implementation of that adds to their price). The style of the tent also has a great impact on its ease of use.
* &quot;Weather conditions&quot;
*:A tent can be more or less able to cope with cold weather or rainy conditions. The amount of water resistance is sometimes measured in the unit millimeters, water gauge. Tents can be defined by the number of season that they can be used. There are two-season, three-season and four-season tents. Two-season tents are ideal for warm/hot temperatures but do not cope well with rainy and windy conditions. Three-season tents can handle most weather conditions including rain and wind but will struggle in heavy snow. Four-season tents can withstand any weather conditions. Design and material vary depending on the number of seasons the tent can withstand.

== Shelters ==
Shelters are not normally used for sleeping. Instead they may act as a store or provide shelter from sun, rain, or dew.

* A &quot;fly&quot; (or flysheet) consists of a single rectangular sheet of material. Two opposite sides are held up in the middle by poles, or sometimes just a rope between conveniently placed trees. The tops of the poles are attached via guy ropes to pegs, in order to keep the poles upright. Additional guy ropes are attached to the lower edges to pull them outwards away from the poles.
* A &quot;gazebo&quot; uses a framework of metal poles to support a roof. This structure provides a lot more usable space than does a flysheet, since the gently sloping roof allows for a reasonable amount of headroom even at the edges (like a frame tent). Because a gazebo is free-standing, it is often used as a shelter for a temporary shop at a fair or street market.
* A &quot;beach tent&quot; is often a simplified form of dome tent and provide a useful (relatively sand-free) place to temporarily store beach equipment, but is at most showerproof. Some beach tents use specially treated fabric which is opaque to ultra-violet light, and so provide some protection against sunburn. Maximum height is typically about , and they are usually not large enough for an adult to lie down in.
* A &quot;fishermen&#x27;s tent&quot; is also a modified dome tent, often with a projecting awning high enough to sit under, but sometimes with no closable doorway.

== Modern styles ==
With modern materials, tent manufacturers have great freedom to vary types and styles and shapes of tents.
* The poles effectively hold the tent in the required shape.
* Poles which dismantle for ease of transport are either colour-coded or linked by chain or cord, so there is little doubt as to which poles connect where.
* Relatively few guy ropes are needed (sometimes none).
* The exact positioning of any guy ropes is not too critical.

=== Rigid poles ===
Many tents which use rigid steel poles are free-standing and do not require guy ropes, though they may require pegs around the bottom edge of the fabric. These tents are usually so heavy (25 to 80 kg) that it takes a rather strong wind to blow them away.


* &quot;Frame&quot; tents are double-skin tents. They have a living area and one or more cotton/nylon/polyester inner tents. The outer tent is draped over a free-standing steel frame, and may be made of canvas or polyester (the latter often has a hydrostatic head of 3000 mm, i.e. three season camping). The living area is generally at least as large as the sleeping area, and there may be a specific section with a window and extra air vents for use as a kitchen. The walls are nearly vertical and are typically about high. The center of the gently sloping roof is often high or more and provides reasonable headroom throughout. The smaller two-person models were less than 3 metres square (10 ft), but these have largely been replaced by dome or tunnel tents. The larger eight-person models may exceed in length and/or width.
* &quot;Cabin&quot; tents are single-skin tents used mainly in the USA. They often have nylon walls, polyester roof, and a polyethylene floor, plus an awning at one or both ends. With a hydrostatic head of only 1000 mm, they may best be considered as summer tents. Removable internal dividers allow the cabin to be split into &#x27;rooms&#x27;. Sizes may range from 13 ft by 8 ft (two rooms) up to 25 ft by 10 ft (four rooms), with wall and roof heights similar to those of frame tents. There are three separate pole units, with each unit consisting of two uprights and a connecting ridge. These pole units support the centre and ends of the roof, and are usually outside the tent.
* &quot;Pop Up&quot; tents, sometimes appearing hyphenated as pop-up tents, are very easy to use and to carry. Perfect for professional campers who want to spend the smallest time in pitching the tent.
* &quot;Wall&quot; tents are the largest and most accommodating canvas tents available. They are popular with hunters and backcountry campers. Wall tents provide much room space, as well as more than enough head space which allows people to move about freely inside the tent without crouching or bending over. This type of set up is great for those who spend much time in their tents, as well as for those who need extra space for cots, tables, stoves, etc. Also known as outfitter tents.
* &quot;Spike&quot; tents are smaller and lighter than wall tents and so they are easier to pack and lighter to haul, they are a good choice if weight is the main concern and if there are not many people sleeping in one tent. Spike tent frames vary in size and style but are almost always lighter than wall tent frames. Also known as wigwam tents.
* &quot;Range&quot; tents are similar to spike tents in their shape and size, except range tents usually do not have side walls at all. They resemble a pyramid type shape and are often referred to as pyramid tents. Range tents can either be set up with a bi-pole system that goes on the outside of the tent, or they can be set up using a single frame pole which goes in the middle of the tent on the inside, and they can also be set up by tying the top of the tent to a hanging tree branch. Also known as teepee tents.

=== Flexible poles ===

Flexible poles used for tents in this section are typically between long. Cheap poles are made of tubes of fibreglass with an external diameter less than , whereas more expensive aluminium alloys are the material of choice for added strength and durability. For ease of transportation, these poles are made in sections some long, with one end of each section having a socket into which the next section can fit. For ease of assembly, the sections for each pole are often connected by an internal elastic cord running the entire length of the pole.

* &quot;Dome&quot; tents have a very simple structure and are available in a wide variety of sizes ranging from lightweight two-person tents with limited headroom up to six or nine-person tents with headroom exceeding . These may be single wall, or single-wall with partial flysheet, or double wall. Depending on the pole arrangement, some models pitch outer-tent first, while others pitch inner-tent first. The former helps keep the inner tent dry, but the latter is easier to pitch.

:The basic dome has a rectangular floor and two poles which cross at the peak; each pole runs in a smooth curve from one bottom corner, up to the peak, and then down to the diagonally opposite bottom corner. There are usually special fittings at each corner which fit into sockets at the ends of each pole – pole tension keeps everything in shape. The poles can run on either the inside or outside of the tent fabric. When located on the interior, poles are held in place by a variety of means including hook and loop style straps, clips, and other fastening hardware. Poles that are located on the outside of the tent fabric are attached via fabric pole sleeves or plastic clips. Dome tents do not require guy ropes and pegs for structural integrity as they are considered free-standing, but must be pegged down in high winds.

:The basic dome design has been modified extensively, producing tents with three poles, tents with irregularly-shaped bases, and other unusual types. A common variation is to add a third pole between two adjacent corners; this is angled away from the tent and supports an extension of the flysheet, to give a porch/storage area.

* &quot;Tunnel&quot; tents may offer more usable internal space than a dome tent with the same ground area, but almost always need guy ropes and pegs to stay upright. These are almost always double wall tents. Sizes range from one-person tents with very limited headroom up to eight or ten-person tents with headroom exceeding .
:A basic tunnel tent uses two or more flexible poles, arranged as parallel hoops, with tent fabric attached to form a half-cylinder or tapering tunnel. The most common designs have a sleeping area at one end and a vestibule area at the other, though vestibules (possibly extended) at each end are not uncommon, or vis-à-vis sleeping at either end and a central opening to a common vestibule area are made too.

* &quot;Hybrid dome/tunnel&quot; tents are now common. One variation is to use a basic dome as the sleeping area; one or two hooped poles to one side are linked by a tunnel to the dome to provide a porch. Another variation is to use a large dome as the living area, with up to four tunnel extensions to provide sleeping areas.
* &quot;Geodesic&quot; tents are essentially dome tents with two or more extra poles which criss-cross the normal two poles to help support the basic shape and minimise the amount of unsupported fabric. This makes them more suitable for use in snowy conditions and in strong winds. To help withstand strong winds they are rarely more than high.
* &quot;Single-hoop&quot; tents use just one flexible pole and are often sold as light-weight one or two-person tents. These are the modern equivalent of older style pup tents, and have the same feature of somewhat limited headroom. Different styles may have the pole going either along or across the tent.
* The &quot;pop-up&quot; tent is a recent innovation. This type of tent is equipped with built-in very flexible hoops so that when the tent is unpacked, it springs into shape immediately, and so is extremely easy to set up. Such tents are usually single-skinned and are generally aimed at the one-season or children&#x27;s end of the market; their high flexibility makes them unsuitable for use in windy situations. After use the tent is packed down into a thick disc shape.

=== Inflatable airbeams ===
Inflatable pole supports, also known as airbeams, serve as rigid structural supports when inflated but are soft and pliable when deflated. Tents using such technology are neither commonly used nor widely accepted and are available from a very limited number of suppliers.

Much like a bicycle tube and tire, airbeams are often composed of a highly dimensionally stable (i.e. no stretch) fabric sleeve and an air-holding inner bladder. However, other airbeam constructions consist of coated fabrics that are cut and manufactured to its intended shape by a method such as thermal welding. Depending on the desired tent size, airbeams can be anywhere from 2-40 inches in diameter, inflated to different pressures. High pressure airbeams (40-80 psi) that are filled by compressors are most often used in larger shelters, whereas low pressure beams (5-7 psi) are preferred for recreational use. The relatively low pressure enables the use of a manual pump to inflate the airbeam to the desired level. Airbeams have the unique quality of bending, rather than breaking, when overloaded. Tents that use inflatable airbeams are structured almost identically to those that use flexible poles.
* &quot;Dome&quot; tents that use inflatable airbeam support are available in a variety of sizes ranging from lightweight 2-person to larger 6+ person shelters, and are virtually identical to the arrangement of flexible-pole supported dome tents. Beams are usually integrated into the tent shell such that they do not have to be reinserted every time setup occurs. Airbeams can be located on either the inside or outside of the tent shell. Similar to the pole-supported construction, airbeam supported dome tents are free standing but should be staked out with pegs and guyout lines to increase stability and strength.
* &quot;Tunnel&quot; tents are a common form of airbeam supported tents because their size can be easily modified by adding additional hoops. Military applications use this style of tent for a range of purposes including medical shelters, helicopter enclosures, and airplane hangars. In these constructions, hoops are generally identical in size. In commercial airbeam supported tents, the hoops can be different sizes. Tunnel tents tend to withstand high winds well because of their low profile shape. However, the tents are not freestanding and must be anchored and guyed out securely.

== Older tent styles ==
Most of these tent styles are no longer generally available. Most of these are single-skin designs, with optional fly sheets for the ridge tents.

All the tents listed here had a canvas fabric and most used a substantial number of guy ropes (8 to 18). The guys had to be positioned and tensioned fairly precisely in order to pitch the tent correctly, so some training and experience were needed. Pup tents might use wooden or metal poles, but all the other styles mentioned here used wooden poles.

* A &quot;pup tent&quot; is a small version of a ridge tent intended for 1 to 3 people. It usually has a rectangular floor of size ranging from 4 ft by 6 ft up to 6 ft by 8 ft, and ridge heights ranging from 3 ft up to 5 ft. Larger versions have side walls, usually about 1 ft high. There are guy ropes for each pole. Versions with sides add guys at each corner and in the centre of each side. These guy ropes help to maintain the required shape. Earlier versions had a single upright pole at each end, while later versions often have two poles at each end, arranged rather like an &#x27;A&#x27; shape, in order to make access easier. Some models have a horizontal ridge pole joining the tops of the end poles to support the centre of the tent. Many armies issue pup tents as &quot;shelter halves&quot;, with each soldier carrying half a tent in his field gear, so two soldiers together can pitch a tent and share it.
* A &quot;ridge tent&quot; or wall tent can sleep 5 to 8 people or more. They usually have a rectangular floor of size ranging from 8 ft by 10 ft up to 16 ft by 20 ft, and ridge heights around 6 ft to 9 ft. The side walls are usually about 3 ft high. They normally have a single upright pole at each end with the tops joined by a horizontal ridge pole. Longer models might have an additional upright pole in the centre to help support the ridge pole. They often have two guy ropes at each corner, and guy ropes every 2 ft along the sides. If strong winds are expected then two additional storm guy ropes are attached to the top of each pole. Ridge tents are often used by hunters and outfitters as they will accommodate several persons, their equipment and related gear. Many can be equipped with wood stoves for heating and cooking. There are several manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada that make wall tents that have foot prints of greater than 220 square feet. The canvas of wall tents may be treated for water, mildew and fire retardancy.
* A &quot;square centre-pole tent&quot; was often used for family camping in the first half of the 20th century. Despite the use of 9 poles and 12 guy ropes, such a tent could be pitched by an experienced family of four in some 10 to 15 minutes. These tents had a square floor of size ranging from 8 by 8 ft up to 15 by 15 ft. There were poles about 5 ft high at each corner and in the middle of each side, and a 10 ft or 12 ft pole in the centre – the walls were vertical and the roof was pyramid-shaped, so there was plenty of headroom over most of the tent.
* A &quot;Sibley tent (bell tent)&quot; had a circular floor plan some 10 ft to 15 ft across, a single central pole some 10 ft high, and walls about 3 ft high. Guy ropes were connected every 2 ft around the top of the walls – these had to carefully tensioned to hold the pole upright and keep the tent in shape.

== Marquees and larger tents ==

These larger tents are seldom used for sleeping.
* A marquee is a large tent used as a temporary building. They have long been used for circus or other performances, fairs, banquets, large weddings, religious tent revival events or, more recently corporate entertainment events. Traditionally made of canvas, modern &quot;party tents&quot; are more likely to use PE (polythene) or, for higher quality, PVC. &#x27;DIY&#x27; marquees are available up to wide. widths are very expensive and require specialized equipment and skill to erect, so they must usually be rented. Many corporations own large (9 m to 45 m wide) marquee tents but have them installed and maintained by qualified professionals. Party tents are held down with tensioned ratchets and/or stakes. Sizes range from .
* A pole marquee consists of canvas and more recently PVC, under tension by means of centre poles, side poles and guy ropes which are attached to ground stakes hammered into soft surfaces only such as a lawn or field. Hand made of white cotton canvas, traditional poled marquees are more attractive but much less practical and versatile than aluminium frame marquees. The modern PVC traditional pole marquee was introduced due to the material being easier to clean than woven canvas and giving them a longer hire life span.
* A tension tent is a newer variation of the pole marquee. The general design is similar to the pole marquee. However, it usually has fewer poles, and the integrity of the structure is maintained by the tension of the fabric. It also is very similar to a tensile structure It is often used for outdoor weddings, parties and other events. It has been adapted and updated in various other tent types including the High Peak Frame Tent and Freeform / Stretch / Flex Tent styles developed in South Africa
* Freeform / Stretch / Flex Tents have developed since 2000 driven predominantly by companies in South Africa and in Australia. The composition of the fabric differs slightly between those from South Africa and those in Australia. Stretch Tent Fabrics have been produced using Nylon and Polyester. Since 2007 Stretch Tents have been introduced into Europe by some of the South African companies such as Intent. Stretch Tents utilize aluminum, wooden and bamboo poles capped by molded polypropylene or rubber domes that push through the stretched fabric, creating tension between the ground and the fabric. The fabric can be sculpted into various organic and curvaceous forms to provide shade and rain cover for events. The tensioned fabric must be made rigid and the tent form allow water run-off and resistance to wind load before erection is complete.
* Aluminium frame marquees – Aluminium frame tents have no centre poles or guy ropes. This kind of marquee can be erected on almost any surface and adjacent to buildings or annexe tents. The Aluminium frame tent is much more stable and can span a much wider area over pools, flower beds or trees. In the UK this design is the most commonly used style for most retail rentals and can be found being used as temporary structures for storage in retail and military applications.

* A newer category of the Marquee/Party tents is the High Peak Frame Tents (known by several brand names like &quot;frame &amp; cable&quot;, &quot;vista&quot;, &quot;pinnacle&quot;, &quot;Century&quot; etc.). These tents have the advantage of the pole tents with the high top, ease of installation, cleaner look, and fewer parts. They also have the advantage of the Frame Tents as they do not have support pole(s) on the inside of the tent that touches the ground. The high top look is accomplished by using a &quot;floating pole&quot;, which is a pole that sits on cables that run across the tent interior from the top of the sides. Most tent manufactures are now making these tents and they come in a variety of sizes and shapes that can be joined to meet the needs of unique space requirements.
* Marquee tents typically have interchangeable parts, which allow for a rental company to easily expand to larger sizes. Tents can be ordered in a variety of colours. However, white is by far the most popular colour. Skylights can also be built into the fabric, which allow a greater amount of light to enter and is useful if walls are being used. Walls can also be ordered with clear vinyl windows in them.
* Shamiana is a popular Indian ethnic tent shelter, which is commonly used for outdoor parties, marriages, restaurants etc. Its side walls are detachable. The external fabric can be multicolored or can hold exquisite designs. The history of Shamiana, dates back to the Mughal era. As per Government of India service tax rules under Finance Act 1997, the definition of Shamiana is given under the clause (77A) of section 65, that is: &quot;pandal or shamiana means a place specially prepared or arranged for organizing an official, social or business function&quot;.
* &quot;Bail Ring Tents&quot; are usually tents that are wide and expandable to any length. They can be made from either vinyl or canvas. The purpose of the bail ring style is to raise an enormous amount of material &quot;the tent&quot; off the ground without using heavy machinery. Initially, the center poles are raised and guyed out to stakes after which the tent is spread out and connected to the bail ring using shackles. Once the outside of the tent is raised a crew of men can go under the tent and start raising the bail ring up the center pole using a system of pulleys. This style of tent is not as popular as it was in the past due to the advancement of forklifts and skidsteers. There was a time when even smaller tents were often raised and set using a bail ring.
* The four Major golf tournaments have tents set up. They are usually .
* Tents or marquees are often hired from specialist companies.
* A &quot;Rubb Hall&quot; is a large tent used primarily as emergency warehousing.
* A circus tent usually has one or more oval or circular arenas surrounded by tiered seating which might accommodate thousands of people. Nowadays such large tents are made of some artificial fibre (polyester or vinyl) and are often erected with the help of cranes. In earlier times it was common for the circus elephants to be used as a source of power for pulling ropes to haul the canvas into position.
*Spiegeltent, a Belgian tent constructed in wood and canvas and decorated with mirrors and stained glass, intended as an entertainment venue

== Influence on building design ==
Tent design has influenced many large modern buildings. These buildings have in turn influenced the next generation of tent design. Tent-style tensile structures are used to cover large public areas such as entertainment venues, arenas and retail areas (example: The O2) or sports stadiums (example: Munich Olympic Stadium) and airports (example: Denver International Airport). The Sami Parliament of Norway is inspired by the lavvu, a tent traditionally used by the Sami people.

<text>John Scott Harrison (October 4, 1804 – May 25, 1878) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio from 1853 to 1857. He was a son of U.S. president William Henry Harrison and First Lady Anna Harrison as well as the father of U.S. president Benjamin Harrison. He is the only person to have been both a father and son of a U.S. president.

== Early life ==
Harrison was born on October 4, 1804 in Vincennes, Indiana, where Grouseland, the family home was located. He was one of ten children born to then Governor of the Indiana Territory, and future President, William Henry Harrison and his wife, Anna Tuthill Symmes. His elder brother, John Cleves Symmes Harrison, married the only surviving daughter of Zebulon Pike.

His paternal grandparents were Elizabeth ( Bassett) Harrison and Declaration of Independence signer Benjamin Harrison V. His maternal grandparents were Anna ( Tuthill) Symmes and John Cleves Symmes, an associate justice on the Supreme Court of New Jersey.

Harrison completed preparatory studies and studied law. He later abandoned this to become a farmer.

== Career ==
He was elected a Whig to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1852, reelected an Oppositionist in 1854 and served from 1853 to 1857. In 1855, he declined &quot;the use of his name in connection with the office of Governor at the coming election&quot;. After being defeated for a third term in 1856, Harrison retired to his estate &quot;Point Farm&quot; in North Bend, Ohio.

In August 1860 Harrison, along with Larz Anderson, was nominated as Constitutional Union Party candidate (organized largely by former Whig Party members from the Southern United States who opposed secession) for the second district at the Bell and Everett Convention. In 1861, he was nominated on the Democratic ticket as Lieutenant Governor of Ohio along with Hugh J. Jewett as Governor.

==Personal life==
In 1824, he married Lucretia Knapp Johnson (1804–1830). They had three children:

* Elizabeth Short Harrison (1825–1904), who married George Coleman Eaton.
* William Henry Harrison (1827–1829), who died young.
* Sarah Lucretia Harrison (1829–1917), who married Thomas Jefferson Devin.

On August 12, 1831, in Cincinnati, Ohio, he married Elizabeth Ramsey Irwin (1810–1850), a daughter of Archibald Irwin and Mary ( Ramsey) Irwin. He and Elizabeth had 10 children:

* Lt.-Col. Archibald Harrison (1832–1870); Commander, 27th Indiana Infantry Regiment who contracted tuberculosis; he married Elizabeth Sheets in 1858.
* Benjamin Harrison (1833–1901), who became a U.S. Senator in 1881 before becoming the 23rd President of the United States in 1889.
* Mary Jane Harrison (1835–1867), who married Samuel Vance Morris, later a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, in 1859.
* Anna Symmes Harrison (1837–1838), who died young.
* John Irwin Harrison (1839), who died young.
* Carter Bassett Harrison (1840–1905); Captain, 51st Ohio Infantry Regiment; he married Sophia Ridgely Dashiell in 1863.
* Anna Symmes Harrison (1842–1926), who married her sister&#x27;s widower, Samuel Vance Morris, in 1869.
* John Scott Harrison Jr. (1844–1926), who married Sophia Elizabeth Lytle.
* James Findlay Harrison (1847–1848), who died young.
* James Irwin Harrison (1849–1850), who died young.

After his father&#x27;s death, in 1841, his mother moved in with his family to help raise the children.

Harrison died in North Bend, Ohio on May 25, 1878, aged 73, the last surviving child of William Henry Harrison. He was interred in the family tomb in North Bend, today the William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial, with his parents and other family members. Harrison&#x27;s body was stolen by grave robbers until it was eventually returned to its final place of rest.

=== Body snatching ===
At that time it was common practice for graves to be robbed for recently deceased bodies for use in teaching dissection and anatomy at medical colleges. As a result, many precautions were taken to secure Harrison&#x27;s grave, including building a cemented brick vault, filling the grave with earth mixed with heavy stones, and employing a watchman to check the grave each hour of every night for a week.

The day of Harrison&#x27;s funeral it was discovered that the body of Augustus Devin, which had been buried the previous week in an adjoining grave, had been stolen. The following day, one of John Harrison&#x27;s sons, together with a friend of Devin, traveled to Cincinnati to look for his body. With search warrants in hand they went to the Ohio Medical College, where they discovered not Devin&#x27;s body but the naked body of John Scott Harrison hanging from a rope in a chute. Devin&#x27;s body was later found preserved in a vat of brine at the medical college of the University of Michigan.

The outrage over the act, amid changing sensibilities regarding death, contributed materially to passage of the Ohio Anatomy Law of 1881, a landmark statute, whereby medical schools were provided with unclaimed bodies, which in turn discouraged grave robbers by removing their primary market. As to the personal results, suits were brought against the Ohio Medical College; the Harrison estate was entered in a separate damage suit, in the amount of $10,000. The end result and decision in the three civil suits brought has been lost in the passage of time, and no documentation is known to exist with this specific information.

<text>Amenorrhea or amenorrhoea is the absence of a menstrual period in a female who has reached reproductive age. Physiological states of amenorrhoea are most commonly seen during pregnancy and lactation (breastfeeding). 

Amenorrhoea is a symptom with many potential causes. Primary amenorrhea is defined as an absence of secondary sexual characteristics by age 13 with no menarche or normal secondary sexual characteristics but no menarche by 15 years of age. It may be caused by developmental problems, such as the congenital absence of the uterus, failure of the ovary to receive or maintain egg cells, or delay in pubertal development. Secondary amenorrhoea, ceasing of menstrual cycles after menarche, is defined as the absence of menses for three months in a woman with previously normal menstruation, or six months for women with a history of oligomenorrhoea. It is often caused by hormonal disturbances from the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, premature menopause, intrauterine scar formation, or eating disorders.

== Pathophysiology ==
Although amenorrhea has multiple potential causes, ultimately, it is the result of hormonal imbalance or an anatomical abnormality.

Physiologically, menstruation is controlled by the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. GnRH acts on the pituitary to stimulate the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH and LH then act on the ovaries to stimulate the production of estrogen and progesterone which, respectively, control the proliferative and secretary phases of the menstrual cycle. Prolactin also influences the menstrual cycle as it suppresses the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary. Similarly, thyroid hormone also affects the menstrual cycle. Low levels of thyroid hormone stimulate the release of TRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn increases both TSH and prolactin release. This increase in prolactin suppresses the release of LH and FSH through a negative feedback mechanism. Amenorrhea can be caused by any mechanism that disrupts this hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, whether that it be by hormonal imbalance or by disruption of feedback mechanisms.

== Classification ==
Amenorrhea is classified as either primary or secondary.

=== Primary amenorrhea ===
Primary amenorrhoea is the absence of menstruation in a woman by the age of 16. Females who have not reached menarche at 14 and who have no signs of secondary sexual characteristics (thelarche or pubarche) are also considered to have primary amenorrhea. Examples of amenorrhea include constitutional delay of puberty, Turner syndrome, and Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.

It produces the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics, which are the sprouting of pubic and armpit hair, development of the breasts, and a lack of definition in the female body structure, such as the waist and hips.

=== Secondary amenorrhea ===
Secondary amenorrhoea is defined as the absence of menstruation for three months in a woman with a history of regular cyclic bleeding or six months in a woman with a history of irregular menstrual periods. Examples of secondary amenorrhea include hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, and functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.

== Causes ==

=== Primary amenorrhea ===

==== Turner syndrome ====
Turner syndrome, monosomy 45XO, is a genetic disorder characterized by a missing, or partially missing, X chromosome. Turner syndrome is associated with a wide spectrum of features that vary with each case. However, one common feature of this syndrome is ovarian insufficiency due to gonadal dysgenesis. Most people with Turner syndrome experience ovarian insufficiency within the first few years of life, prior to menarche. Therefore, most patients with Turner syndrome will have primary amenorrhea. However, the incidence of spontaneous puberty varies between 8–40% depending on whether or not there is a complete or partial absence of the X chromosome.

==== MRKH ====
MRKH (Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser) syndrome is the second-most common cause of primary amenorrhoea. The syndrome is characterized by Müllerian agenesis. In MRKH Syndrome, the Müllerian ducts develop abnormally and result in the absence of a uterus and cervix. Even though patients with MRKH have functioning ovaries, and therefore have secondary sexual characteristics, they experience primary amenorrhea since there is no functioning uterus.

====Other Intersex conditions ====
Individuals with a female phenotype can present with primary amenorrhea due to complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency, pure gonadal dysgenesis, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, and mixed gonadal dysgenesis.

==== Constitutional delay of puberty ====
Constitutional delay of puberty is a diagnosis of exclusion that is made when the workup for primary amenorrhea does not reveal another cause. Constitutional delay of puberty is not due to a pathologic cause. It is considered a variant of the timeline of puberty. Although more common in boys, girls with delayed puberty present with onset of secondary sexual characteristics after the age of 14, as well as menarche after the age of 16. This may be due to genetics, as some cases of constitutional delay of puberty are familial.

=== Secondary amenorrhea ===

====Breastfeeding====
Physiologic amenorrhea is present before menarche, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and after menopause.

Breastfeeding or lactational amenorrhea is also a common cause of secondary amenorrhoea. Lactational amenorrhea is due to the presence of elevated prolactin and low levels of LH, which suppress ovarian hormone secretion. Breastfeeding typically prolongs postpartum lactational amenorrhoea, and the duration of amenorrhoea varies depending on how often a woman breastfeeds. Due to this reason, breastfeeding has been advocated as a method of family planning, especially in developing countries where access to other methods of contraception may be limited.

==== Diseases of the thyroid ====
Disturbances in thyroid hormone regulation has been a known cause of menstrual irregularities, including secondary amenorrhea.

Patients with hypothyroidism frequently present with changes in their menstrual cycle. It is hypothesized that this is due to increased TRH, which goes on to stimulate the release of both TSH and prolactin. Increased prolactin inhibits the release of LH and FSH which are needed for ovulation to occur.

Patients with hyperthyroidism may also present with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. Sex hormone binding globulin is increased in hyperthyroid states. This, in turn, increases the total levels of testosterone and estradiol. Increased levels of LH and FSH have also been reported in patients with hyperthyroidism.

==== Hypothalamic and pituitary causes ====
Changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is a common cause of secondary amenorrhea. GnRH is released from the hypothalamus and stimulates the anterior pituitary to release FSH and LH, which in turn stimulate the ovaries to release estrogen and progesterone. Any pathology in the hypothalamus or pituitary can alter the way this feedback mechanism works and can cause secondary amenorrhea.

Pituitary adenomas are a common cause of amenorrhea. Prolactin secreting pituitary adenomas cause amenorrhea due to the hyper-secretion of prolactin which inhibits FSH and LH release. Other space occupying pituitary lesions can also cause amenorrhea due to the inhibition of dopamine, an inhibitor of prolactin, due to compression of the pituitary gland.

==== Polycystic ovary syndrome ====
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting 4–8% of women worldwide. It is characterized by multiple cysts on the ovary, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, and increased androgens. Although the exact cause remains unknown, it is hypothesized that increased levels of circulating androgens is what results in secondary amenorrhea. PCOS may also be a cause of primary amenorrhea if androgen access is present prior to menarche. Although multiple cysts on the ovary are characteristic of the syndrome, this has not been noted to be a cause of the disease.

==== Low body weight ====
Women who perform extraneous exercise on a regular basis or lose a significant amount of weight are at risk of developing hypothalamic amenorrhoea or exercise amenorrhoea. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA) can be caused by stress, weight loss, or excessive exercise. Many women who diet or who exercise at a high level do not take in enough calories to maintain their normal menstrual cycles. The threshold of developing amenorrhoea appears to be dependent on low energy availability rather than absolute weight because a critical minimum amount of stored, easily mobilized energy is necessary to maintain regular menstrual cycles. Amenorrhoea is often associated with anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders. Relative energy deficiency in sport, also known as the female athlete triad, is when a woman experiences amenorrhoea, disordered eating, and osteoporosis.

Energy imbalance and weight loss can disrupt menstrual cycles through several hormonal mechanisms. Weight loss can cause elevations in the hormone ghrelin which inhibits the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarial axis. Elevated concentrations of ghrelin alter the amplitude of GnRH pulses, which causes diminished pituitary release of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Low levels of the hormone leptin are also seen in females with low body weight. Like ghrelin, leptin signals energy balance and fat stores to the reproductive axis. Decreased levels of leptin are closely related to low levels of body fat, and correlate with a slowing of GnRH pulsing.

==== Drug-induced ====
Certain medications, particularly contraceptive medications, can induce amenorrhoea in a healthy woman. The lack of menstruation usually begins shortly after beginning the medication and can take up to a year to resume after stopping its use. Hormonal contraceptives that contain only progestogen, like the oral contraceptive Micronor, and especially higher-dose formulations, such as the injectable Depo-Provera, commonly induce this side effect. Extended cycle use of combined hormonal contraceptives also allow suppression of menstruation. Patients who stop using combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP) may experience secondary amenorrhoea as a withdrawal symptom. The link is not well understood, as studies have found no difference in hormone levels between women who develop amenorrhoea as a withdrawal symptom following the cessation of COCP use and women who experience secondary amenorrhoea because of other reasons. New contraceptive pills which do not have the normal seven days of placebo pills in each cycle, have been shown to increase rates of amenorrhoea in women. Studies show that women are most likely to experience amenorrhoea after one year of treatment with continuous OCP use.

The use of opiates (such as heroin) on a regular basis has also been known to cause amenorrhoea in longer term users.

Anti-psychotic drugs, which are commonly used to treat schizophrenia, have been known to cause amenorrhoea as well. Research suggests that anti-psychotic medications affect levels of prolactin, insulin, FSH, LH, and testosterone. Recent research suggests that adding a dosage of Metformin to an anti-psychotic drug regimen can restore menstruation. Metformin has been shown to decrease resistance to the hormone insulin, as well as levels of prolactin, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH).

==== Primary ovarian insufficiency ====
Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) affects 1% of females and is defined as the loss of ovarian function before the age of 40. Although the cause of POI can vary, it has been linked to chromosomal abnormalities, chemotherapy, and autoimmune conditions. Hormone levels in POI are similar to menopause and are categorized by low estradiol and high levels of gonadotropins. Since the pathogenesis of POI involves the depletion of ovarian reserve, restoration of menstrual cycles typically does not occur in this form of secondary amenorrhea.

==Diagnosis==
===Primary amenorrhoea===
Primary amenorrhoea can be diagnosed in female children by age 14 if no secondary sex characteristics, such as enlarged breasts and body hair, are present. In the absence of secondary sex characteristics, the most common cause of amenorrhoea is low levels of FSH and LH caused by a delay in puberty. Gonadal dysgenesis, often associated with Turner syndrome, or premature ovarian failure may also be to blame. If secondary sex characteristics are present, but menstruation is not, primary amenorrhoea can be diagnosed by age 16.

Evaluation of primary amenorrhea begins with a pregnancy test, prolactin, FSH, LH, and TSH levels. Abnormal TSH levels prompt evaluation for hyper- and hypo-thyroidism with additional thyroid function tests. Elevated prolactin levels prompt evaluation of the pituitary with an MRI to assess for any masses or malignancies. A pelvic ultrasound can also be obtained in the initial evaluation. If a uterus is not present on ultrasound, karyotype analysis and testosterone levels are obtained to assess for MRKH or androgen insensitivity syndrome. If a uterus is present, LH and FSH levels are used to make a diagnosis. Low levels of LH and FSH suggest delayed puberty or functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. Elevated levels of FSH and LH suggest primary ovarian insufficiency, typically due to Turner syndrome. Normal levels of FSH and LH can suggest an anatomical outflow obstruction.

===Secondary amenorrhea===
Secondary amenorrhea&#x27;s most common and most easily diagnosable causes are pregnancy, thyroid disease, and hyperprolactinemia. A pregnancy test is a common first step for diagnosis.

Similar to primary amenorrhea, evaluation of secondary amenorrhea also begins with a pregnancy test, prolactin, FSH, LH, and TSH levels. A pelvic ultrasound is also obtained. Abnormal TSH should prompt a thyroid workup with a full thyroid function test panel. Elevated prolactin should be followed with an MRI to look for masses. If LH and FSH are elevated, menopause or primary ovarian insufficiency should be considered. Normal or low levels of FSH and LH prompts further evaluation with patient history and the physical exam. Testosterone, DHEA-S, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels should be obtained if there is evidence of excess androgens, such as hirsutism or acne. 17-hydroxyprogesterone is elevated in congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Elevated testosterone and amenorrhea can suggest PCOS. Elevated androgens can also be present in ovarian or adrenal tumors, so additional imaging may also be needed. History of disordered eating or excessive exercise should raise concern for hypothalamic amenorrhea. Headache, vomiting, and vision changes can be signs of a tumor and needs evaluation with MRI. Finally, a history of gynecologic procedures should lead to evaluation of Asherman syndrome with a hysteroscopy or progesterone withdrawal bleeding test.

== Treatment ==
Treatment for amenorrhea varies based on the underlying condition. Treatment not only focuses on restoring menstruation, if possible, but also preventing additional complications associated with the underlying cause of amenorrhea.

=== Primary amenorrhea ===
In primary amenorrhea, the goal is to continue pubertal development, if possible. For example, most patients with Turner syndrome will be infertile due to gonadal dysgenesis. However, patients are frequently prescribed growth hormone therapy and estrogen supplementation to achieve taller stature and prevent osteoporosis. In other cases, such as MRKH, hormones do not need to be prescribed since the ovaries are able to function normally. Patients with constitutional delay of puberty may be monitored by an endocrinologist, but definitive treatment may not be needed as there will eventually be progression to normal puberty.

=== Secondary amenorrhea ===
Treatment for secondary amenorrhea varies greatly based on the root cause. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea is typically treated by weight gain through increased calorie intake and decreased expenditure. Multidisciplinary treatment with monitoring from a physician, dietitian, and mental health counselor is recommended, along with support from family, friends, and coaches. Although oral contraceptives can cause menses to return, oral contraceptives should not be the initial treatment as they can mask the underlying problem and allow other effects of the eating disorder, like osteoporosis, continue to develop.

Patients with hyperprolactinemia are often treated with dopamine agonists to reduce the levels of prolactin and restore menstruation. Surgery and radiation may also be considered if dopamine agonists, such as cabergoline and bromocriptine are ineffective. Once prolactin levels are lowered, the resulting secondary amenorrhea is typically resolved. Similarly, treatment of thyroid abnormalities often resolves the associated amenorrhea. For example, administration of thyroxine in patients with low thyroid levels restored normal menstruation in a majority of patients.

Although there is currently no definitive treatment for PCOS, various interventions are used to restore more frequent ovulation in patients. Weight loss and exercise have been associated with a return of ovulation in patients with PCOS due to normalization of androgen levels. Metformin has also been recently studied to regularize menstrual cycles in patients with PCOS. Although the exact mechanism still remains unknown, it is hypothesized that this is due to metformin&#x27;s ability to increase the body&#x27;s sensitivity to insulin. Anti-androgen medications, such as spironolactone, can also be used to lower body androgen levels and restore menstruation. Oral contraceptive pills are also often prescribed to patients with secondary amenorrhea due to PCOS in order to regularize the menstrual cycle, although this is due to the suppression of ovulation.

<text>Mafia, also known as Werewolf, is a Russian social deduction game created by Dimitry Davidoff in 1986. The game models a conflict between two groups: an informed minority (the mafiosi or the werewolves) and an uninformed majority (the villagers). At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams. The game has two alternating phases: first, a night-phase, during which those with night-killing-powers may covertly kill other players, and second, a day-phase, in which all surviving players debate and vote to eliminate a suspect. The game continues until a faction achieves its win-condition; for the village, this usually means eliminating the evil minority, while for the minority, this usually means reaching numerical parity with the village and eliminating any rival evil groups.
==History==
Dimitry Davidoff (, &quot;Dmitry Davydov&quot;) is generally acknowledged as the game&#x27;s creator. He dates the first game of &quot;Mafia&quot; to spring 1987 at the Psychology Department of Moscow State University, from where it spread to the classrooms, dorms, and summer camps of Moscow University. &quot;Wired&quot; attributes the creation to Davidoff and also dates the first game to 1987. He developed the game to combine psychology research with his duties teaching high school students. It became popular in other Soviet colleges and schools, often associated with hugely popular TV series &quot;La Piovra&quot;, which first ran in 1986. In the 1990s it began to be played in other parts of Europe (in some countries under the name &quot;City of Palermo&quot;) and then the United States. By the mid 1990s a version of the game became a Latvian television series with a parliamentary setting, and played by Latvian celebrities.

Andrew Plotkin gave the rules a werewolf theme in 1997, arguing that the mafia had less cultural resonance, and that the werewolf concept fit the idea of a hidden enemy who looked normal during the daytime. Mafia and a variant called Thing have been played at science fiction writers&#x27; workshops since 1998, and have become an integral part of the annual Clarion and Viable Paradise workshops. The Werewolf variant of Mafia became widespread at major tech events, including the Game Developers Conference, ETech, Foo Camps, and South By Southwest. In 1998 the Kaliningrad Higher school of the Internal Affairs Ministry published the methodical textbook &quot;Nonverbal communications. Developing role-playing games &#x27;Mafia&#x27; and &#x27;Murderer&quot;&#x27; for a course on Visual psychodiagnostics, to teach reading body language and nonverbal signals. In September 1998 Mafia was introduced to the Graduate College at Princeton University, where a number of variants were developed. The werewolf theme was also incorporated in the French adaption of Mafia, The Werewolves of Millers Hollow.

In August 2000, a user under the alias &quot;mithrandir&quot; of The Gray Labyrinth, a website devoted to puzzles and puzzle solving, ran a game of Mafia adapted for play on a forum board. Both The Grey Labyrinth and sister site MafiaScum claim that this was the first game of Mafia run on a forum board. From there, Mafia has spread to numerous online communities.

In March 2006 Ernest Fedorov was running a Mafia Club in Kyiv, using his own patented variation of the rules. The club organizes games, rates players, and awards prizes (including a Sicily trip for their tournament-series champion).

In June 2006 a Rockingham school inquiry was launched after parents complained of the traumatic effects classroom Mafia was having on their fifth-grade children. Davidoff responded to the reports, saying that as a parent who had studied child psychology for 25 years, he felt that the game could &quot;teach kids to distinguish right from wrong&quot;, and that the positive message of being honest could overcome the negative effects of an &quot;evil narrator&quot; moderating the game as if it were a scary story.

Mafia is one of the 50 most historically and culturally significant tabletop games since 1800 according to about.com in 2005.

==Gameplay==
In its simplest form, Mafia is played by two teams: the mafiosi and the villagers. Live games require a moderator who does not participate as a player, and identities are assigned by handing out cards, or by other non-verbal methods such as physically tapping players. At the start of the game, every mafioso is given the identities of their teammates, whereas the innocents only receive the number of mafiosi in the game.

In an open setup, the numbers of each power role (e.g. militia) present in the game is known to the players, while in a closed setup, this information is not revealed, and in a semi-open setup, only limited or tentative information about the power roles is revealed.

There are two phases: &quot;night&quot; and &quot;day&quot;. At night, certain players secretly perform special actions; during day, players discuss and vote to eliminate one player. These phases alternate with each other until all mafiosi have been eliminated or they reach numerical parity with the innocents.

Some players may be given roles with special abilities (see below). Common special roles include an investigative role, a protector role, and some association roles.

Andrew Plotkin recommends having exactly two mafiosi, whereas the original Davidoff rules suggest a third of the players (rounding to the nearest whole number) be mafiosi. Davidoff&#x27;s original game does not include roles with special abilities. In his rules for &quot;Werewolf&quot;, Plotkin recommends that the first phase be night and that there be an odd number of players (including the moderator). These specifications avoid tie votes for eliminations and ensure that the game will end dramatically on an elimination rather than anticlimactically with murder as a foregone conclusion.

===Night===

All players close their eyes. The moderator then instructs all mafiosi to open their eyes and acknowledge their accomplices. The mafiosi pick a &quot;victim&quot; by silently gesturing to indicate their target and to show unanimity then close their eyes again.

A similar process occurs for other roles with nightly actions. In the case of the seer, the moderator may indicate the target&#x27;s innocence or guilt by using gestures such as nodding or head shaking. Night may be accompanied by players tapping gently to mask sounds made by gesturing.

===Day===

The moderator instructs players to open their eyes and announces who &quot;died&quot; the previous night. Discussion ensues among the living players. At any point, a player may accuse someone of being a mafioso and prompt others to vote to eliminate them. If over half of the players do so, the accused person is eliminated and night begins. Otherwise, the phase continues until an elimination occurs.

According to some rules, the role of dead players should be revealed; according to others, for example, if the protector dies, nobody should know that. In both cases, dead players are not permitted to attempt to influence the remainder of the game.

Because players have more freedom to deliberate, days tend to be longer than nights.

==Game theory==

===Mathematical study===
Mafia is a complicated game to model, so most analyses of optimal play have assumed both (a) that there are only townsfolk and Mafiosi and (b) that the townsfolk never have a probability of identifying the Mafia that is better than chance. Early treatment of the game concentrated on simulation, while more recent studies have tried to derive closed-form equilibrium solutions for perfect play.

In 2006, the computer scientists Braverman, Etesami and Mossel proved that without detectives and with perfect players the randomized strategy is optimal for both citizens and mafia. When there is a large enough number of players to give both groups similar probability of winning, they showed that the initial number of mafiosi &quot;m&quot; needs to be proportional to the square root of the total number of players &quot;P&quot;, that is formula_1. With a simulation, they confirmed that 50 mafiosi would have almost a 50% chance to win among 10,000. The Mafia&#x27;s chance of victory is

formula_2

which is a good approximation when the right hand side is below 40%. If any detectives are added to the game, Braverman et al. proved that the number of Mafiosi must remain at a fixed proportion of the total number of players for their chance of winning to remain constant.

In 2008, Erlin Yao derived specific analytical bounds for the mafia&#x27;s win probability when there are no detectives.

In a paper from 2010, the exact formula for the probability that the mafia wins was found. Moreover, it was shown that the parity of the initial number of players plays an important role. In particular, when the number of mafiosi is fixed and an odd player is added to the game (and ties are resolved by coin flips), the mafia-winning chance do not drop but rise by a factor of approx. formula_3 (equality in the limit of the infinite number of players).

===Results in live play===
In live (or videoconference) real-time play, the innocents typically win more often than game theory suggests. Several reasons for this have been advanced:
* The physiological stress of sustained lying degrades the initial ability of mafioso to deceive the innocents, much more than a model of perfect play would predict, especially if the innocents can get the town emotionally involved in the game&#x27;s outcome:

* The information revealed by the mafiosi voting patterns tells against them later in the game. One of the game&#x27;s fans, Max Ventilla, has said that &quot;If the villagers are allowed to keep a pencil and paper, they always win.&quot;
* As players get more experienced, their strategic sophistication and ability to spot and use deception increases. They will typically get better at the skills needed for playing innocents faster, being villagers more often than mafiosi.
* The Metagame aspect: Dimma Davidoff has said past connections will always lose to future collaborations. When playing several Mafia games with the same people, it&#x27;s more helpful to be known for honesty than for deceit. Davidoff considers that so important that he thinks the advantages of playing the mafioso role honestly outweigh the disadvantages.

But the Mafia &quot;can&quot; win in live play; their best chance of winning occurs when mafioso bond with their innocent neighbours and convince those neighbours to value that bond over dispassionate analysis. The game designers Salen and Zimmerman have written that the deep emergent social game play in Mafia (combined with the fear of elimination) create ideal conditions for this.

==Optional roles==

These additional roles are named differently in the many versions of Mafia, for thematic flavor, or historical reasons. Also, the same role-name can have differing functions across different versions of the game. What follows is a general list of role &quot;types&quot; found in Mafia variants; since the specific names vary by milieu it must be non-exhaustive.
===Investigative roles===
Players with these roles use their own night-phase to discover something about other players. Though the standard game now includes the basic Detective, these roles are optional, and games can exclude them entirely (such as the stool pigeon variant, or Davidoff&#x27;s original rules).

====Investigative roles (standard)====
&quot;Detective&quot;, &quot;Seer&quot;, &quot;Commandant&quot;, &quot;Sheriff&quot;, &quot;Police&quot;, etc.
: Allied with the Innocents, the Detective can detect whether a player is a mafioso. They will typically wake up, and point at one person; the Narrator will silently indicate to the Detective whether that player is Mafia or Innocent. In some versions of the game, the Detective&#x27;s investigation result is announced publicly by the Narrator, for example &quot;the Detective found a Mafioso!&quot;. More commonly, no announcement is made. As with other roles, which player is the detective is not generally known, leaving anyone the option of pretending to be the Detective.
: A Detective is usually included in modern games. For example, somebody is &quot;always&quot; assigned this role in all commercial card game versions, and almost all internet-based, and most face-to-face games start with at least one detective. Multiple detectives either act in separate night phases (unaware of the identities of other detectives) or work together as the police (an association role).
: In the online Mafia variant &quot;Town of Salem&quot;, the Sheriff is a role which can interrogate people at night to discover their possible innocence. Generally, most Town roles appear innocent; and most roles that are considered evil appear suspicious to the Sheriff.

====Investigative roles (less common)====
&quot;Psychic&quot;, &quot;Wizard&quot;, &quot;Fortune Teller&quot;, &quot;Oracle&quot;, &quot;Tracker, Watcher,&quot; etc.
: Psychic, Psychologist, or Sorcerer-type investigators can determine other players&#x27; roles, rather than their alignments. Roles which detect other roles are usually implemented in the same way as the Detective&#x27;s ability to determine alignment. For example: the Psychologist points to a player (at night) for a Thumbs-up from the moderator if the Vigilante is pointed to. A Tracker may see what someone&#x27;s night action was, or the target of their action, while a Watcher may see all those who visited someone at night.
: Information revealed to investigators is fallible (in more complicated variants). Online versions can give information with a confidence level, and in other variants the Narrator deceives the Detective by showing all players as Innocent, all as Guilty, giving reversed results, or random information (these can be termed as Naive, Paranoid, Insane, or Random respectively). Additionally, some Alignment roles give immunity to successful investigation.
: In some games, there are Mafia Detectives, who have the power of a normal detective but are on the Mafia side. The Super Commandant has the standard power of a Detective, while also protecting the &quot;investigated&quot; from night-time attack.

===Omniscient roles===
&quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;Child&quot;, &quot;Little Girl&quot;, etc.
: Instead of having to investigate, some innocent roles give complete information on the entire mafia: The witness is told who the mafia are during the first night, while the mafia are not told the witness&#x27;s identity (differing from the stool pigeon in not being a part of the mafia). 
: The Little Girl in &quot;Werewolf&quot; and &quot;Werewolves of Miller&#x27;s Hollow&quot; is allowed to secretly peek and watch as the werewolves choose their victim; if discovered doing so by the Werewolves, she dies of fright.

===Protective roles===
&quot;Guardian Angel&quot;, &quot;Doctor&quot;, &quot;Bodyguard&quot;, &quot;Hero, Jailer&quot;, etc.
: Allied with the Innocents, the Doctor-type role defends others at night. Typically, they will awaken at night after the Mafia have gone back to sleep and point at one person to protect; that person will survive any night-time attack. They are typically allowed to protect themselves, and are commonly barred from protecting the same target on successive nights. A Guardian Angel can only protect others. The Nurse gains the Doctor&#x27;s abilities if the Doctor dies. The Jailer protects innocents just like the doctor, but also simultaneously blocks their night action. The Firefighter, or the Herbalist can protect from some night-time attacks but not others (in Werewolf, for example, they choose one person to protect with wolfsbane, but that person may still be killed by the Serial Killer). Other games limit this ability to a certain number of times.
: Bodyguard-type roles sacrifice themselves to prevent (and sometimes kill the corresponding attacker) a single attack on a player.

===Killing roles===
&quot;Vigilante&quot;, &quot;Veteran,&quot; &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Bomb&quot;, &quot;Woodcutter&quot;, etc.
: Aside from Mafia, Werewolves, and Serial Killers (solitary guilty parties), the Innocents may have some roles with the ability to kill at night. The Vigilante is an innocent who kills every night, in their own night-time phase sometimes. In some variations, the Vigilante has limited ammunition. Some variations introduce a time limit of two nights before the player in the Killing Role can kill again. Other variations add the trait that if the Vigilante kills an innocent they either lose the ability to kill or die from guilt the next night. The Veteran has a finite-use ability (usually 3); if activated, anyone who targets them (friend or foe) will be killed. The Bomb may only trigger if targeted at night (not necessarily for death) by another role. Variants exist where this person can kill during the daytime cycle (e.g., the Terrorist / Gravedigger), sometimes only if executed during the daytime. The Woodcutter or Hunter can take one other person with them whenever they die.

===Alignment roles===
&quot;Miller&quot;, &quot;Godfather&quot;, &quot;Alpha Wolf&quot;, &quot;Wildcard&quot;, etc.
: Some roles can fool investigations to determine their alignments: the Miller is an Innocent who appears guilty (usually because they are an outsider); the Godfather, on the other hand, appears innocent despite being the Mafia leader. The Alpha Wolf or Master Werewolf have the same role as the Godfather in &quot;Werewolf&quot; settings.

===Double-agent roles===
&quot;Traitor&quot;, &quot;Possessed&quot;, &quot;Undercover Cop&quot;, &quot;Godfather&quot;, etc.
: The Traitor is not a mafioso (in that he does not awake at night and is not revealed as a mafioso by Detective type roles), but works to protect them and hamper the town during the day cycle, and wins only with a Mafia victory. Conversely, the Undercover Cop is a mole within the Mafia group who acts with the Mafia but wins with the innocents. The stool pigeon may be the only optional role in play, and must inform villagers of the mafia while appearing as mafiosi; it makes up one of the few modern game forms to be played without an investigative role.
:Distinct from the alignment-role Godfather, the double-agent Godfather behaves as a standard mafioso, but wakes again (after the Mafia sleep) to perform an extra kill. This Godfather-role wins only if he survives.

===Role manipulators===
&quot;Role-blocker&quot;, &quot;Bus Driver&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, &quot;Barman&quot;, &quot;Witch,&quot; etc.
: These roles can stop or alter the night actions of others; for instance, they may prevent a protection or investigation from occurring, or they may change the target. The Role-blocker can block the Vigilante for a night, while the Thief, Prostitute or Hypnotizer might be able to disable the powers of any selected target.
: When the thief is used in &quot;Werewolves&quot;, an additional townsfolk card is added before dealing, and the Thief may choose on the first night to steal the role of another player or to take the unused role card. The player whose role was stolen gets the unused role card and the Thief card is discarded.
: Rerouting-type roles, such as those in &quot;Town of Salem&quot; (like the Witch and Transporter), may control the visiting target of a player.

===Recruitment roles===
&quot;Godfather&quot;, &quot;Psychiatrist&quot;, &quot;Piper&quot;, &quot;Cult Leader&quot;, etc.
: The Mafia Godfather may be able to recruit innocent players into their faction under certain circumstances. The Yakuza is a regular mafia player with an extra power: they may sacrifice themselves from the second night (during the night) and choose an innocent to join the mafia. Vampires may convert selected players (usually innocents only, to prevent evil factions from exposing converted among them) to other Vampires.
: Each night, the scientist selects a player to cure; if a mafioso is cured, they awaken as an innocent. The Psychiatrist is an innocent with the ability to convert the Serial Killer into a normal innocent.
: Cult Leaders recruit followers at night instead of kill; they act as an independent faction, usually with the ability to talk at night. 
: The Piper wins by charming every surviving player; she charms players at night, who then know each other (but not the piper) but are otherwise unaffected.

===Association roles===
&quot;Freemasons (Masons)&quot;, &quot;Siblings&quot;, &quot;Lovers&quot;, &quot;Police&quot;, etc.
: Possessors of these roles know one another and what their roles are. On the innocent&#x27;s side, a Mason usually has no special abilities, but knows the identity of all other Masons and that all Masons are also innocent. Every member of the detectives or the police knows all the rest, because they collaborate at night to investigate someone (sharing the powers of the Detective role between them).
: Sibling pairs typically consist of one Mafia and one Innocent; in most versions, if one is killed, the other also dies. Cupid in &quot;Werewolf&quot; chooses a pair of Lovers on the first night. In this variant, the Lovers can also win the game (regardless of whether they are Mafia, Innocents, or both) by being the last two standing. Like Siblings, however, if one of the pair dies, the other dies as well.
: In a modded variation of the games &quot;Town of Salem, and Town of Salem 2,&quot; the Jackal is a role that is given two recruits from normally opposing factions at the start of the game, and has to win with them both of them together as a single faction, knowing who they are. The recruits do not know the Jackal, but know each other, and cannot communicate with each other or the Jackal at night.

===Election roles===
&quot;Doublevoter&quot;, &quot;Priest&quot;, &quot;Rabble Rouser&quot;, &quot;Lawyer&quot;, etc.
: Until the dies there are two eliminations per day.
: In some games there are players who can change the vote count. Some players have 2 votes (Doublevoter); some players can only cast the final vote to kill a player (Actor); cannot vote to eliminate (Voteless Innocent); must delegate someone else to vote for them (Fool), or require one fewer vote to eliminate (Hated Innocent). The Priest cannot place the final vote (this role is not necessarily the same as the Reanimation-role priest). The &quot;lawyer&quot; selects someone during the night, and if that person tops the elimination vote the next day, saves them (a different &quot;lawyer&quot; role releases the wills written by players killed up to that point, when she dies). The Monarch is a role in &quot;Town of Salem 2&quot; which can grant extra voting power to any player of their choice, twice per game.

===Public roles===
&quot;Mayor&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot;, &quot;Sheriff&quot;, &quot;President&quot;, etc.
: This role is taken in addition to the assigned role, and it endows the player with additional, overt, powers (particularly during the daytime). Empowerment can be random, but is usually made by vote. For instance, the Mayor or Sheriff can be elected each morning, and gain two elimination votes, or a Judge could moderate discussion in parliamentary fashion (to the advantage of their team). The elected President has the sole elimination vote.

===Handicapped roles===
&quot;Drunk&quot;, &quot;Village Idiot&quot;, &quot;Teenage Werewolf&quot;, etc.
: This may be a secondary role, taken in addition to the assigned role. However, it has the opposite effect, giving the bearer a handicap, like speaking only gibberish in the case of the Village Drunk, etc.
: Alternatively, it may be a standard role with a particular constraint, such as the teenage werewolf who must say the word werewolf at least once each day.

===Handicapper roles===
&quot;Silencer&quot;, &quot;Dentist&quot;, &quot;Prostitute&quot;, &quot;Fog&quot;, etc.
: The Dentist may select any other player at night, and prevent them speaking during the following day. The Silencer is a mafioso with the identical power, except that they may not silence the same player on successive days. The silenced individual wakes in the morning and is immediately instructed not to talk until the end of the day. They can still raise their hand to vote in live games (although, if they were silenced by a prostitute, they are not allowed to vote).

===Post-mortem roles===
&quot;Dark Background&quot;, &quot;Priest&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Coroner&quot;, etc.
: The dark background roles are (mafia or innocent) except for revealing a deceptive alignment when killed. The M.E. gathers information from the killings that can help the innocents, while the Priest learns about the alignment of the dead in the same way that the Detective learns about the living. The Medium can interrogate dead players. While the coroner survives, the narrator will explain the means of death in all night kills. In the games &quot;Town of Salem&quot; and &quot;Town of Salem 2&quot;, the Jester is a Neutral role that may kill once after being voted out.

===Reanimation roles===
&quot;Reviver&quot;, &quot;Governor&quot;, &quot;Martyr&quot;, &quot;Witch&quot;, etc.
: Revivers and Master Revivers are able to resurrect dead players, Master Revivers can bring the revived into their association (e.g., the Masons: see Association roles). The players resurrected by a Necromancer are converted to the Necromancer&#x27;s alignment; those revived by the voodooist join a separate zombie group. The Governor can reprieve those killed during the daytime, as can the Martyr if he sacrifices himself. The Witch has a (single-use) revival potion. At night, she&#x27;s shown who will die in the morning, and can choose to save them.

===Rule-immune Roles===
&quot;Bulletproof&quot;, &quot;Oracle&quot;, &quot;Elder&quot;, etc.
: The Bulletproof innocent is invulnerable at night, though usually with limits; for example, the Elder will survive the first night attack, but not the second.
: The Oracle has an investigative role similar to a Seer but also has the power to talk when inactive (talking in a sleep phase is usually a rule infraction).
: The games &quot;Town of Salem&quot; and &quot;Town of Salem 2&quot; rely on a system consisting of several levels of night immunity and attack. Lynching (or voting out) is considered to surpass all night immunity.

===Special roles===
&quot;Baker, chef,&quot; &quot;Village Idiot&quot;, &quot;Cobbler&quot;, etc.
: The baker is on the side of the innocents. During the night, the baker gives one player a loaf of bread, potentially revealing their identity. If the baker dies, the innocents have just three nights to dispose of the mafia, or the innocents starve, and the mafia win. The Cobbler, Villager, or Jester has the objective of convincing the town to kill them, or is required to vote in favor of all proposed eliminations. Sometimes, successful elimination of the Village Idiot results in the mafia being able to kill two people that night.

===Complicated roles===
Additional variations exist, sometimes with even more specialized or complicated abilities. There are many special roles, and many moderators design novel roles for each game. Some commercial variants ship with blank cards to allow this customization. For example, neutral factions such as the serial killer could exist (the serial killer would have to kill everyone, innocent or mafia, to win).

==Variations==
The naming of various roles, factions, and other elements of play is theme-dependent and has limitless variation. Common alternative themes restyle the mafia as werewolves, cultists, assassins, or witches, with other roles being renamed appropriately.

Over the years, players have created Mafia variants that include additional rules. Some of these are listed here.

===Variations on the win conditions===
If there are as many mafiosi as innocents in the day-phase then a mafia victory is declared immediately, under the original Mafia rules. With the ability to deny a majority at an elimination vote, remaining mafiosi cannot be eliminated unless innocent/neutral killing roles exist. Other variants suspend this rule, and only declare the game after every member of one faction has been eliminated: this makes the game easier to explain, and to run.

===Election variants===
Nominees for elimination may be allowed to make a speech in their own defense. Usually, each player must vote, can only vote once and cannot vote for themselves. But some variants have a more complicated process of selecting players to be executed. Davidoff&#x27;s original &#x27;Mafia&#x27; allowed multiple day-time executions (per day), each needing only a plurality to action.

Voting variants abound, but any elimination usually requires an absolute majority of the electorate, or votes cast. So the voting is usually not by secret ballot for multiple candidates with the highest vote count eliminated; it is more usual for the voting to be openly resolved either by:
* A nomination or series of elections structured to ultimately offer a choice between two candidates, or
* An option to eliminate (or not eliminate) one suspect (with a new suspect produced if the last one survives the vote).

====Tied votes====
Deadlocked elections can be resolved by lot or by killing the player with the scapegoat special role.

The special case of one mafioso and one innocent remaining can be decided randomly or be ruled a Mafia win—this is more usual in live play.

====Optional elimination variant====
The Innocents can choose not to kill anybody during the day. Although commonly unsure of Mafia identities, the Innocents are more likely to randomly kill a mafioso than are the Mafia (at night). Therefore, not eliminating anyone (even at random) will typically favor the Mafia.

However, when the number of survivors is even, No Kill may help the Innocents; for example, when three Innocents and one mafioso remain – voting for No elimination gives a 1/3 chance of killing the mafioso the next day, rather than a 1/4 chance today (assuming random elimination).

===Mafia killing methods===
Some variants require all Mafia members to choose the same victim independently for a kill to succeed. This can be achieved in the following ways:
* By waking the Mafia members up separately.
* By calling out the names of all surviving players and requiring surviving mafiosi to raise their hands when the name of the victim is called out. In this variant, the mafiosi only &quot;wake up&quot; (open their eyes) at the very beginning of the game when they identify each other. This variant also allows other roles to take their actions by simply raising their hands when their target&#x27;s name is called out.
* By having them write their kills. Under this variant, Innocent players write the word &#x27;honest&#x27; on a piece of paper; Mafia members write the name of a player for elimination. If all the mafia notes have the same name on them, that player is considered killed by the Mafia.
In some online versions of the game, a particular player (the Godfather or a designated mafioso) must send in the kill.

Another variant requires the night-time vote to be secret and unanimous, but allows multiple players to be added to the execution queue to ensure unanimity.

===Multiple families===
Multiple, independent groups of mafia or werewolves act and win independently, giving faster game-play and the potential for cross-fire between the factions.

===Attributes===
In this variant, players are given two cards: the first contains their role, the second an attribute. Attributes were originally derived from roles that could apply to both Mafia and Innocent alignments such as &quot;Bulletproof&quot; (cannot be killed at night), &quot;Mayor&quot; (has two votes in the elimination), and &quot;Siamese Twins&quot; (more commonly known as Siblings or Lovers).

===Quantum Werewolf===
This variant was developed by Steven Irrgang and used for a puzzle in the 2008 CISRA Puzzle Competition. The difference from a standard game of Mafia is that players are not initially assigned roles, but rather on each day are given the probabilities describing the game&#x27;s current quantum state. Each player with a non-zero probability of being a seer or a werewolf performs the appropriate night actions (which may not be effective if it is later determined that the player did not have that role). When a player is killed, the wave function collapses and the players are given updated probabilities.

===Train Mafia===
Traditional Mafia re-envisioned and heavily modified by the Copenhagen Game Collective to be played in a subway metro. In this variation, players who are eliminated are kicked off the train (at the next stop), and must wait in shame for the following train – a kind of &#x27;afterlife&#x27; train – to join a second, interwoven game.

===Invisible City: Rebels vs. Spies===
A location-based mobile gaming variant for Android, designed for city center play. The two factions are: the Rebels, the majority; and the Spies, the informed minority. The rule-set replaces expulsions with scoring by round. Each player is assigned an individual mission each round. Some missions are critical and if one of those fails, the round goes to the Spies, but only one player knows which missions are critical.

===Ultimate Werewolf===
In this version of Mafia, the main enemies are the werewolves, as opposed to the mafia. The werewolves wake at night to kill a player, who is usually a Villager. Other helpful roles such as the Seer, Bodyguard, and Witch exist to help purge the village of werewolves, but other neutral roles exist such as the Tanner, lovers (if Cupid is in the game and the lovers are from different teams), and a third major faction: Vampires.

====One Night variant====

In this standalone game published by Bezier Games, players only &quot;sleep&quot; and close their eyes for a single night at the beginning of the game. They then have a single day of discussion, with a single elimination. No players are eliminated as the game progresses. There is no moderator, so everyone gets to participate as a member of the town or village. When playing this game, three more role cards are used than the number of players; when everyone is randomly dealt out their card the three extra ones placed in the middle of the table. To begin the game one of the players, with eyes closed, will act as the &quot;caller&quot; on the single starting night, going through the nighttime roles once: Werewolves and Minions (if in play) will identify each other, the Seer will examine one player&#x27;s card or two of the middle cards, the Robber will steal another player&#x27;s role card and replace it with their own, the Troublemaker will blindly swap two players&#x27; role cards, the Insomniac wakes up to check if their role card has been swapped, etc. The game ends on a single elimination vote, with the villagers winning if a single werewolf is caught, and the werewolves winning if no werewolves are killed. This game can be played with as few as three players. Play time can be as quick as five minutes per game.

===Town of Salem===

&quot;Town of Salem&quot; is an advanced online version of Mafia that takes place during the Salem witch trials. It involves several different roles from multiple factions. The game was updated on 6 June 2017, to add a new faction: the Coven, which mainly consists of witches and is similar in function and goal to the more traditional Mafia.

A sequel to the game, &quot;Town of Salem 2&quot;, was released on 26 May 2023. The game removes the Mafia faction, but repurposes the function of most roles within the Mafia into the Coven. Gameplay remains similar to the original game.

== Online play ==

Mafia can also be played online. Games can be played on IRC channels, where a bot assumes the role of a game moderator and the interaction of players is conducted via textual communication.

Playing mafia-like games online opens the possibility of long-lasting games, such as the ones on forums. In such games, one day in real life usually corresponds to one day within the game, so players log in each morning to see who was killed during the night phase.

Online games have several advantages. There is no need to gather many people in the same room, so organizing and playing a game of Mafia is faster and more convenient. Removing the human moderator and the need for players to close their eyes removes the possibility of accidental revelation of information. Online play also allows role mechanics which would be too cumbersome to use in a physical version of the game.

A drawback of online play is the lack of direct face-to-face communication, which many consider the most important aspect of Mafia. Some sites organize Mafia games with web cams, so that face-to-face communication is preserved. The long-lasting online mafia games that are usually played via online forums do not necessarily have this drawback. People who communicate via forums usually do not know each other in real life.

In a traditional Mafia game, all of the players are in one room. There is no way to communicate with another player in private. With online games, this is not the case. Many Mafia game forums and game sites have rules that mandate that only one channel of communication must be used for all game-related discussion.

==Artificial intelligence==
Werewolf is a subject of artificial intelligence research due to its unique features such as persuasion and deception. The game requires several AI technologies such as multi-agent coordination, intentional reading, and understanding of the theory of mind.

Deep learning has been used in an attempt to develop agents that can win the game as werewolves or as villagers. Regular expressions have been used to parse utterance logs for divulgence (or &quot;coming-out&quot; as a role) and decision information, although one difficulty has been that a statement such as &quot;Player A is a werewolf&quot; could be based on either the player&#x27;s ability (e.g. as seer) or just speculation.

==Reception==
In the 2010 book &quot;Family Games: The 100 Best&quot;, Lester W. Smith commented that &quot;the secret to the success of &quot;Werewolf&quot; comes down to human interaction. From its earliest incarnation in a university classroom in Moscow to the session of &quot;The Werewolves of Miller&#x27;s Hollow&quot; I held in my home [...] the fascination is in experiencing the psychology of a justifiably paranoid community trying to rid itself of a hidden evil – and too often learning that they sacrificed an innocent instead.&quot;

<doc id="235406" wikidata="Q1411238" url="?curid=235406" title="Mother India">
<text>Mother India is a 1957 Indian epic drama film, directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Nargis, Sunil Dutt, Rajendra Kumar and Raaj Kumar. A remake of Khan&#x27;s earlier film &quot;Aurat&quot; (1940), it is the story of a poverty-stricken village woman named Radha (Nargis), who in the absence of her husband, struggles to raise her sons and survive against a cunning money-lender amidst many troubles.

The title of the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo&#x27;s 1927 polemical book &quot;Mother India&quot;, which vilified Indian culture. &quot;Mother India&quot; metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of its independence in 1947, and alludes to a strong sense of Indian nationalism and nation-building. Allusions to Hindu mythology are abundant in the film, and its lead character has been seen as a metonymic representation of an Indian woman who reflects high moral values and the concept of what it means to be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women&#x27;s empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai&#x27;s Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The music by Naushad introduced global music, including Western classical music and orchestra, to Hindi cinema.

The film was one of the most expensive Indian productions and earned the highest revenue for any Indian film at that time. Adjusted for inflation, &quot;Mother India&quot; still ranks among the all-time Indian box office hits. It was released in India amid fanfare in October 1957 and had several high-profile screenings, including one at the capital, New Delhi, attended by the country&#x27;s president and prime minister. &quot;Mother India&quot; became a definitive cultural classic and is regarded as one of the best films in Indian cinema as well as being one of three Hindi-language films to be included on the list of &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.&quot; The film won the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film, the Filmfare Best Film Award for 1957, and Nargis and Khan won the Best Actress and Best Director awards respectively. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film, becoming the first Indian film to be ever nominated.

==Plot==
In 1957, the construction of an irrigation canal to the village is completed. Radha, considered to be the &quot;mother&quot; of the village, is asked to inaugurate the canal. She reminisces about her past when she was newly married.

The wedding between Radha and Shamu is paid for by Radha&#x27;s mother-in-law, who borrows money from the moneylender Sukhilala. The conditions of the loan are disputed, but the village elders decide in favour of the moneylender. Subsequently, Shamu and Radha are forced to pay three-quarters of their crop as interest on the loan of ₹500.

While Shamu works to bring more of their rocky land into use, his arms are crushed by a boulder. Ashamed of his helplessness (being without arms) and humiliated by Sukhilala for living on the earnings of his wife, Shamu decides that he is of no use to his family and permanently leaves Radha and their three sons, walking to his probable death by starvation. Soon after, Radha&#x27;s youngest son and her mother-in-law die. A severe storm and the resulting flood destroy houses in the village and ruin the harvest. Sukhilala offers to save Radha and her sons if she trades her body to him for food. Radha vehemently refuses his offer but also loses her infant to the atrocities of the storm. Although the villagers initially begin to evacuate the village, they decide to stay and rebuild it, persuaded by Radha.

Several years later, Radha&#x27;s two surviving children, Birju and Ramu, are young men. Birju, embittered since childhood by the demands of Sukhilala, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala&#x27;s daughter, Rupa. Ramu, by contrast, has a calmer temperament and is married soon after. Birju&#x27;s anger finally becomes dangerous, and after being provoked, he attacks Sukhilala and his daughter, stealing Radha&#x27;s kangan (marriage bracelets) that were pawned with Sukhilala. He is chased out of the village and becomes a bandit. Radha promises Sukhilala that she will not let Birju cause harm to Sukhilala&#x27;s family. On Rupa&#x27;s wedding day, Birju returns with his gang of bandits to exact his revenge. He kills Sukhilala and kidnaps Rupa. When he tries to flee the village on his horse, Radha, his mother, shoots him. He dies in her arms. In 1957, Radha opens the gate of the canal, and its reddish water flows into the fields.

===Title===
The title &quot;Mother India&quot; was inspired by American author Katherine Mayo&#x27;s 1927 polemical book of the same name, in which she attacked Indian society, religion and culture. Written against the Indian demands for self-rule and independence from British rule, the book pointed to the treatment of India&#x27;s women, the untouchables, animals, dirt, and the character of its nationalistic politicians. Mayo singled out what she thought to be the rampant and fatally weakening sexuality of its males to be at the core of all problems, allegedly leading to masturbation, rape, homosexuality, prostitution, venereal diseases, and, particularly, premature sexual intercourse and maternity. The book created an outrage across India, and it was burned along with her effigy. It was criticised by Mahatma Gandhi as a &quot;report of a drain inspector sent out with the one purpose of opening and examining the drains of the country to be reported upon&quot;. The book prompted over fifty angry books and pamphlets to be published to highlight Mayo&#x27;s errors and false perception of Indian society, which had become a powerful influence on the American people&#x27;s view of India.

Mehboob Khan had the idea for the film and the title as early as 1952, five years after India&#x27;s independence; in October that year, he approached the import authorities of the Indian government to seek permission for importing raw stocks for the film. In 1955, the ministries of External Affairs and Information-and-Broadcasting learned of the title of the forthcoming film and demanded that the director send them the script for review, suspicious that it was based on the book and thus a possible threat to the national interest. The film team dispatched the script along with a two-page letter on 17 September 1955 saying:

===Script===
Khan was inspired by American author Pearl S. Buck and her books &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Mother&quot; (1934); he also saw the film &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (1937), directed by Sidney Franklin. &quot;The Mother&quot; chronicled the life of a Chinese woman, including her married life and lonely struggle after being abandoned by her husband. Aspects of &quot;Mother India&quot;, such as moneylenders, toiling on land, and rearing children through hardship were part of the story. Khan originally drew upon these influences in making his 1940 film &quot;Aurat&quot;, the original version of &quot;Mother India&quot;. Khan bought the rights of &quot;Aurat&quot; from the production company National Studios for 35,000 (valued at about US$7,350 in 1957). Stylistic elements of &quot;Mother India&quot; show similarities with Vsevolod Pudovkin&#x27;s Soviet silent film &quot;Mother&quot; (1926); &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; (1934), directed by King Vidor; and films of Alexander Dovzhenko. Certain imagery in the film, such as &quot;happy farmers, sickles in their hand, smiling from behind ripening crops&quot;, resemble posters by Soviet constructivist artists.

The script of &quot;Aurat&quot; was devised by Wajahat Mirza, based upon a story by Babubhai Mehta. For &quot;Mother India&quot;, it was reworked by Mirza and the young screenwriter S. Ali Raza. Apart from Mehboob Khan, Mirza and Raza, prominent screenwriters Aghajani Kashmeri, Zia Sarhadi, Akhtar Mirza, music director Naushad, assistant director Chimankant Desai and many others were consulted. The dialogue, reworked by Mirza and Raza, is in vernacular Hindi, and its literary counterpart. As Mirza and Raza were from the Urdu literary tradition, they wrote the dialogues in Urdu script.

The script was intentionally written in a way that promoted the empowerment of women in Indian society (including the power to resist sexual advances) and the maintenance of a sense of moral dignity and purpose as individuals; this was contrary to what Mayo had claimed in her book. These themes, present in &quot;Aurat&quot;, were further developed with a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building, using characters personifying abstract qualities such as &quot;beauty and goodness, wealth and power, poverty and exploitation, and community spirit&quot;.

===Casting===
Nargis was the director&#x27;s first choice for the role of Radha, and despite only being aged 26 at the time, she played the new wife, young single mother and an aged mother of two sons. Nargis—the reigning queen of Hindi cinema at the time—had started her career in a leading role with Khan&#x27;s &quot;Taqdeer&quot; (1943) and acted under his direction in &quot;Humayun&quot; (1945) and &quot;Andaz&quot; (1949). &quot;Mother India&quot; is generally regarded as Nargis&#x27;s best performance and was her last major film before retirement after marriage.

Khan had wanted to cast Sabu Dastagir, a Hollywood star of Indian origin, as Birju. Dastagir travelled to India from Los Angeles, stayed in a hotel in Mumbai (then known as Bombay) and received a retainer. However, delays and obstacles in beginning shooting and getting a work permit for Dastagir led to his dismissal from the project. Dilip Kumar, an established actor in the Hindi film industry, had originally expressed an interest in playing Birju, which Khan found agreeable; Dilip Kumar agreed to play Shamu as well. However, Nargis objected that the public would not accept their casting as mother and son because she had done several romantic films alongside him. Sunil Dutt—with the experience of just one film—was finally cast, after Mukri, a comedian in the film, introduced him to Khan. Sajid Khan, the actor who portrayed the young Birju, was unknown at the time and was from a poor family from the Mumbai slums. Sajid&#x27;s salary in the film was 750. He was later adopted by Mehboob Khan. Subsequently, Raaj Kumar was cast as Shamu and Rajendra Kumar as Ramu. &quot;Mother India&quot; was the first successful film and a turning point in the careers of Dutt, Raaj Kumar and Rajendra Kumar.

Before principal photography began, Nargis and Raaj Kumar familiarised themselves with farming practices such as ploughing the fields, reaping and sowing, and cotton picking. The extras in the song and dance sequences of the film were from local dance groups in villages where the shooting took place instead of the usual ones from Mumbai.

===Filming===
The initial filming for &quot;Mother India&quot; began unexpectedly, even before the script and cast were finalised. In 1955, parts of Uttar Pradesh suffered from major flooding. Cinematographer Faredoon Irani travelled to flood-afflicted districts to shoot generic flood scenes. The scheduled principal photography started in 1955 with a budget of (approximately $525,000 in 1957). However, the budget increased by to (approximately in 1957) by the end of the filming because of the outdoor sessions and cast and crew&#x27;s salaries.
Several indoor scenes for the film were shot in 1956 at Mehboob Studios in Bandra, Mumbai. Khan and Irani attempted to shoot frequently on location to make the film as realistic as possible. Locations included various villages in Maharashtra, Gujarat (Maharashtra and Gujarat together formed Bombay State then) and Uttar Pradesh. The film was shot in 35mm. Contemporary cinematographer Anil Mehta has noted the mastery of Irani&#x27;s cinematic techniques in shooting the film, including his &quot;intricate tracks and pans, the detailed mise en scène patterns Irani conceived, even for brief shots—in the studios as well as on location&quot;. The film took about three years to make, from early organisation, planning, and scripting to completion of filming. In a November 1956 interview, Nargis described the film shoot and her role as the most demanding of her career. &quot;Mother India&quot; was shot in Gevacolor, later converted to Technicolor. It was shot mostly using the sync sound technique, which was common at the time; some scenes were dubbed.

For shooting the flood scene, a farmer agreed to flood of his land. In the exodus scene following the flood, 300 bullock carts, 200 farmers and many horses, tractors and ploughs were used. Gayatri Chatterjee writes about the popular belief that all these were made available by villagers without reimbursement, in her book. However, account ledgers of the production revealed that the villagers were paid. There was a protracted scene in the film in which Radha runs between burning haystacks in search for her son Birju, a renegade bandit, who was hiding there. The fire scene was shot in the Umra area of Surat, Gujarat, by burning bales of hay. Nargis and Dutt acted in the fire scene without doubles. On 1 March 1957, an accident occurred during the fire scene when the wind direction changed and the fire grew out of control, trapping Nargis. She was saved by Dutt, who quickly grabbed a blanket, plunged inside, and rescued her. Shooting halted temporarily as both had sustained injuries. Dutt was hospitalised for the burns and Nargis helped nurse him, at Khan&#x27;s place in Billimora. Nargis—a popular actress at the time—fell in love with Dutt, who was in early stages of his film career and played her son in the film; they married on 11 March 1958. Nargis wished to marry soon after the film, but Khan protested that real-life marriage of the onscreen mother-son would be disastrous for the film. Owing to their relationship, Nargis also found it difficult to perform a scene where she beat Dutt with a lathi.

==Themes==
Various authors identify the character of Radha with Hindu mythological goddesses and characters, such as Radha (the lover of the god Krishna, personifying love and romance), Sita (the divine heroine of the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, personifying high moral value), Savitri (representing great morality and loyalty to husband), Draupadi (personifying duty and morality), Dharti-mata (earth-mother goddess) and Lakshmi (Hindu goddess of prosperity). Besides these gentle goddesses, the character of Radha has shades of more ferocious warrior goddesses such as Durga and Kali. Film scholars have compared the mild-mannered, obedient son Ramu with the god Rama of the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, and the romantic outlaw Birju—a name of Krishna—with the god Krishna, known for his transgressions. Shamu (another name of Krishna), Radha&#x27;s husband who leaves her, is also equated with Krishna, who left his lover Radha in mythological accounts. The title &quot;Mother India&quot; and Radha&#x27;s character are described to be allusions not only to the Hindu Mother Goddess, but also to Bharat Mata (literally &quot;Mother India&quot;), the national personification of India, generally represented as a Hindu goddess.

According to professor Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis&#x27;s Mother India is a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that &quot;Mother India&quot; could also be seen as a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book &quot;Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire&quot;, opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity at the end of the film by playing Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.

According to Indian film scholars Gokulsing and Dissanayake, while aspiring to traditional Hindu values, the character of Mother India also represents the changing role of the mother in Indian cinema and society in that the mother is not always subservient or dependent on her husband, refining the relationship to the male gender or patriarchal social structures. The &quot;New Internationalist&quot; said in a 1999 review that Radha transforms from a submissive wife to an independent mother, thereby breaking female stereotypes in Hindi film. In contrast, in a 2012 article in the newspaper &quot;The Hindu&quot;, author Tarini Sridharan has pointed out themes such as upholding female chastity, wifely devotion and saintly motherhood that reinforce gender stereotypes. While the action of sacrificing motherhood to uphold a woman&#x27;s dignity is termed as feminist by some, other authors see it as an attempt of a community woman to protect the patriarchal village structure, that esteems &quot;izzat&quot; (honour) of women. A promotional pamphlet to introduce the social context of the film to western audiences described Indian women as being &quot;an altar in India&quot;, and that Indians &quot;measure the virtue of their race by the chastity of their women&quot;, and that &quot;Indian mothers are the nucleus around which revolve the tradition and culture of ages.&quot;

In a 2002 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic Dave Kehr compares the film with &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; (1937) for the thematic similarity of the series of sacrifices made by the female lead, and with &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) as an epic mirroring social upheavals. Film critic Mark Cousins and author Tejaswini Ganti agree that the film is the &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; of Indian cinema.
The term &quot;Mother India&quot; has been defined as &quot;a common icon for the emergent Indian nation in the early 20th  century in both colonialist and nationalist discourse&quot;. Many authors, including Gayatri Chatterjee, author of &quot;Mother India&quot; (2002), interpret the film as an allegory signifying patriotism and the changing situation in the newly independent nation, and how India was functioning without British authority. It echoes the tale of a modern India, liberating itself from &quot;feudal and colonial oppression&quot;. The film, an archetypal nationalistic picture, is symbolic in that it demonstrated the euphoria of &quot;Mother India&quot; in a nation that had only been independent for 10 years, and it had a long-lasting cultural impact upon the Indian people. Film scholar Saibal Chatterjee considers &quot;Mother India&quot; a &quot;mirror of independent India&quot;, highlighting problems of a nascent nation, including rural exploitation of farmers by money-lenders, in a dramatic fashion understandable to the common viewer. It also represents the agrarian poverty and hardship of the people at the time. The red water that flows from the canal irrigating the green fields at the end of the film is seen by Chatterjee as a metaphor to represent the blood of Indians in the struggle for independence, flowing to nourish a new free India. The canal is described by Virdi to signal the imminent end of the feudal order. However, despite Radha&#x27;s struggle against feudal oppression depicted in the film, her action of stopping the rebellious Birju and upholding status quo—the feudal and patriarchal order—is seen as &quot;regressive&quot; by various authors.

In a study of media and popular culture in South Asia, author Mahasveta Barua draws a parallel between the film&#x27;s metaphorical representation of the mother as a nation, and the metonymic identification with India that Indira Gandhi, India&#x27;s only woman prime minister, sought and tried for during her tenure (1966–77, and 1980–84). In his book &quot;Terrorism, Media, Liberation&quot;, John David Slocum argues that like Satyajit Ray&#x27;s classic masterpiece &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; (1955), Khan&#x27;s &quot;Mother India&quot; has &quot;vied for alternative definitions of Indianness&quot;. However, he emphasises that the film is an overt mythologising and feminising of the nation in which Indian audiences have used their imagination to define it in the nationalistic context, given that in reality, the storyline is about a poverty-stricken peasant from northern India, rather than a true idea of a modernising, powerful nation.

The Radha–Birju relationship is described to have &quot;Oedipal elements&quot; by many authors; Virdi has argued that in her chastity, Radha channels her sexual desires into maternal love for her sons who effectively become &quot;substitute erotic subjects&quot;. Mishra opines that the crushing of the arms of Radha&#x27;s husband and the mellowness of the older son symbolise castration, which is in contrast with the rebellion of Birju, identified with sexual potency. Birju&#x27;s obsession with his mother&#x27;s bracelets is an expression of his oedipal longings, according to Chakravarty. Rachel Dwyer, Professor of Indian Cultures and Cinema at SOAS, describes how &quot;suspiciously smoothly&quot; the Oedipal elements fit into the film and the off-screen romance between Nargis and Dutt, playing mother and son in the film. Radha&#x27;s actions at the end of the film in shooting her own son was a breaking of traditional mother-son relationship to safeguard morality, according to author William Van der Heide. Virdi points out that this brought ambiguity to the mother figure who acts as a sacrificing provider and also as a destroyer, annihilating her own son, something rare in Hindi cinema. She interprets Birju&#x27;s sexual advances on a village girl (which is incest in north Indian village culture) as being a substitute in the plot for the incestuous mother-son relationship and his death at the end as a punishment for violation of the taboo.

Authors such as Eshun and Woods state that Radha and Ramu are the archetypal champions of virtue in battling hardship and injustice, while Birju is a mischievous child who becomes the anarchist whose uncontrollable rebellion destroys order. Mishra has noted that although Radha upholds &quot;Dharma&quot; (the natural law or order) in the film, it is Birju who achieves identification from the spectators; in his rebellion lies the agenda of political action that will usher social change. Mishra notes that due to such conflicting ideas, the film is very much conforming, and yet &quot;defiantly subversive&quot;.

Film scholar Vijay Mishra has pointed out the presence of the &quot;highly syncretic hyphenated Hindu–Muslim nature&quot; of Hindi film industry in the film. Parama Roy has interpreted that Nargis&#x27;s legendary status as the titular &quot;Mother India&quot; is due to Hinduisation of the role and her real-life marriage with a Hindu; she is, according to Roy, scripted as a renouncer of Muslim separatism in the film. Mishra has found metacritical value in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s commentary on the film in his novel &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot; (1995) in which Rushdie describes:

==Music==
The score and soundtrack for &quot;Mother India&quot; were composed by Naushad. Mehboob Khan had worked on eight  films with Naushad and developed a rapport with him. The lyrics were by Shakeel Badayuni. The soundtrack consists of 12 songs and features vocals by Mohammed Rafi, Shamshad Begum, Lata Mangeshkar, and Manna Dey. It was not particularly well-received upon release, and critics said it did not match the high pitch and quality of the film. However, its later reception has been more positive: the soundtrack made Planet Bollywood&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks Ever&quot;, compiled in the 2000s. The review gave the album 7.5 stars out of 10.

&quot;Mother India&quot; is the earliest example of a Hindi film containing Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra. An example is a coda during the scene in which Birju runs away from his mother and rejects her. It features a powerful symphonic orchestra with strings, woodwinds and trumpets. This orchestral music contains extensive chromaticism, diminished sevenths, and augmented scales. It also features violin tremolos. Anne Morcom writes in &quot;Hindi Film Songs and the Cinema&quot; that the piece is unmelodic and &quot;profoundly disturbing&quot;. This use of a western-style orchestra in Indian cinema influenced many later films, such as &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960), which features similar dissonant orchestral music to create the atmosphere at tense moments. The song &quot;Holi Aayi Re Kanhai&quot;, sung by Shamshad Begum, and dance by Sitaradevi has been cited as a typical Hindi film song which is written for and sung by a female singer, with an emotional charge that appeals to a mass audience.

==Reception==
===Release and box office===
The production team had planned to release &quot;Mother India&quot; to commemorate the tenth anniversary of India&#x27;s independence on 15 August 1957, but the film was released over two months later. It premiered at the Liberty Cinema in Mumbai on 25 October 1957, during Diwali; it ran continuously at Liberty for over a year. It was released in Kolkata (then called Calcutta) the same day and in Delhi a week later. It had reached all regions of India by the end of November. Government ministers and other officials were invited to the premieres, and a special screening was held in Rashtrapati Bhavan (the presidential quarter) in New Delhi on 23 October 1957; the event was attended by President Rajendra Prasad, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi. Chief Minister of West Bengal Bidhan Chandra Roy and Governor Padmaja Naidu attended a screening in Kolkata. Impressed with the film&#x27;s nationalistic message, Chief Minister of Bombay State Morarji Desai granted it an exemption from the entertainment tax in the state.

No reliable data is available on the box office earnings of &quot;Mother India&quot;. It was in continuous distribution in theatres in India until the mid-1990s. There was a renewed interest in the film in the 1970s causing an upsurge in ticket sales. According to Chatterjee, it did exceptionally good business in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka (then called Mysore State) and Maharashtra. Film trade websites provide estimates of its business. Box Office India gave the film&#x27;s net collection as and its gross as , the highest for an Indian film up until &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960), while estimating that &quot;Mother India&quot;″s inflation-adjusted net would be equivalent to in January 2008. Box Office India later estimated in 2017 that &quot;Mother India&quot; had over 100million footfalls at the domestic box office, making it one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time when adjusted for inflation. The film&#x27;s success led Khan to name his next film &quot;Son of India&quot;. Released in 1962, it was not well received.

&quot;Mother India&quot; was dubbed in several European languages including Spanish, French and Russian; it did substantial business in Greece, Spain and Russia and was released in the Eastern Bloc countries. Technicolor arranged one screening of the film in Paris on 30 June 1958, under the name &quot;Les bracelets d&#x27;or&quot; (&quot;The Gold Bracelets&quot;). It did minimal business in Paris, but fared better in French colonies. It was successful in the Latin American countries of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. &quot;Mother India&quot; was also acclaimed across the Arab world, in the Middle East, parts of Southeast Asia, and North Africa and continued to be shown in countries such as Algeria at least ten years after its release. It was released in the US on 9 July 1959 to lukewarm response, and the UK release in 1961 was also a commercial failure. The initial international version with English subtitles was 40 minutes shorter than the Indian release.

As of 2013, &quot;Mother India&quot; is available on DVD in all regions NTSC format, distributed by the Eros Entertainment.

===Reviews===
A contemporary review in &quot;Filmfare&quot; praised the cast&#x27;s enthusiastic performances and said that the film &quot;will be remembered for a long time to come&quot;. Baburao Patel of &quot;Filmindia&quot; (December 1957) described &quot;Mother India&quot; after its release as &quot;the greatest picture produced in India&quot; and wrote that no other actress would have been able to perform the role as well as Nargis. A review in a British magazine &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; in 1958 remarked that audiences in UK should be grateful that the international version was shortened by 40 minutes, and termed it a &quot;rag-bag pantomime&quot;. After its US release in 1959, Irene Thirer reviewed the film in the &quot;New York Post&quot; in which she praised its &quot;striking dramatic appeal&quot;, but feared it might not be accepted by American audiences due to cultural differences. In a 1976 article in the journal &quot;Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review&quot;, author Michael Gallagher found the film &quot;an amazing mixture of political allegory and cheap musical, a cross between the impressiveness of Eisenstein and the banality of &quot;Show Boat&quot;&quot;. The &quot;New Internationalist&quot; in 1999 found Nargis&#x27;s acting &quot;exemplary&quot;, and noted &quot;a clever interplay—artistically and politically—between the traditional and the radical&quot; evident in &quot;Mother India&quot;.

In a 2002 article in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, film critic J. Hoberman described the film as &quot;an outrageous &quot;masala&quot; of apparently discordant elements.&quot; He characterised it as a mixture of &quot;indigenous versions of Soviet-style tractor-opera, Italian neo-realism, Hollywood kiddie-cuteness, a dozen Technicolor musical numbers, and, most significantly, a metaphoric overlay of pop Hinduism.&quot; Hoberman criticised the acting as &quot;broad&quot;, and also wrote about the &quot;vaguely left-wing&quot; nationalist overtone of the film. Phill Hall, writing for &quot;Film Threat&quot; in 2002, described the film as exceptionally sluggish and one-dimensional, and lampooned it saying &quot;it takes the strongest of constitutions to endure this film without entertaining notions of matricide.&quot; Jonathan Romney of &quot;The Independent&quot; observed the earth-mother Radha as &quot;India&#x27;s answer to Anna Magnani&quot; and the film as &quot;an all-out exercise in ideological myth-making.&quot; &quot;Women&#x27;s Feature Service&quot;, in a 2007 article, noted &quot;Mother India&quot; as &quot;one of the most outstanding films of the post-Independence era.&quot; Ziya Us Salam of &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote in 2010: &quot;Mehboob was able to blend the individual with the universal, thereby enhancing the film&#x27;s appeal without compromising on its sensitivity.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;Mother India&quot;, Nargis, and Mehboob Khan received many awards and nominations. Nargis won the Filmfare Best Actress Award in 1958 and became the first Indian to receive the Best Actress award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in present-day Czech Republic. &quot;Mother India&quot; won the Filmfare Award for Best Film and scooped several other Filmfare awards including Best Director for Khan, Best Cinematographer for Faredoon Irani, and Best Sound for R. Kaushik. In 1958, the film became India&#x27;s first submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was chosen as one of the five nominations for the category. The international version, 120 minutes long, was sent for the Oscars. Additionally, this version had English subtitles, and dropped Mehboob Productions&#x27; logo, which featured the Communist hammer and sickle, to appease the academy. The 120-minute version was later distributed in the US and UK by Columbia Pictures. The film came close to winning the Academy Award but lost to Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; by a single vote. Khan was utterly disappointed at not winning the award. &quot;He had seen the other films in the fray and believed &quot;Mother India&quot; was far superior to them&quot; recalled Sunil Dutt decades later. It also won two awards at the 5th National Film Awards in 1957: an All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film and Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film in Hindi.

==Legacy==

&quot;Mother India&quot; has been described as &quot;perhaps India&#x27;s most revered film&quot;, a &quot;cinematic epic&quot;, a &quot;flag-bearer of Hindi cinema and a legend in its own right&quot;, Mehboob Khan&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and an &quot;all-time blockbuster&quot;, which ranks highly among India&#x27;s most successful films. It was in continuous distribution, being played in theatres for more than three decades; the record ended in the mid-1990s with the advent of satellite television and a change in Indian film-viewing habits. &quot;Mother India&quot; belongs to only a small collection of films, including &quot;Kismet&quot; (1943), &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960), &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975) &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994), and &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995) which are repeatedly watched throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance. It is also among the only three Indian films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (the others being &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot; and &quot;Lagaan&quot;). The &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; (in 2007) identifies the &quot;film&#x27;s pungent social references&quot; which are &quot;too harsh to be sold at a profit today. But this heartrending tale filled Indians with hope and pride then.&quot; The film was remade in the Telugu language as &#x27; in 1971, in Turkish as &#x27; in 1973 and in Tamil as &quot;Punniya Boomi&quot; in 1978.

&quot;Mother India&quot; is ranked No. 80 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. It is listed among the only three Hindi films in the book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot; (the others being &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; and &quot;Deewaar&quot;). Film critic Anupama Chopra included it in her list of top 100 films in world cinema. In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the film amongst the &quot;Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films&quot;. It was ranked third in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2002 poll of &quot;Top 10 Indian Films&quot;. It was also included in &quot;TIME&quot;″s list of the best Bollywood classics in 2010, and in CNN-IBN&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 greatest Indian films of all time&quot; in 2013. The film was premiered in the &quot;Cannes Classics&quot; section of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN notes that &quot;Mother India&quot; &quot;didn&#x27;t just put India on the world map, it also defined Hindi cinema for decades that followed.&quot; Film critic Dave Kehr agrees that it influenced Indian films for the next 50 years. A 1983 Channel 4 documentary on Hindi cinema describes the film as setting a benchmark in Indian cinema. The shooting stance of Nargis at the end of the film is one of the all-time iconic images of Hindi cinema. Other iconic scenes include Radha pulling the plough through the field (see film poster at the top) and feeding chapatis to her two sons as they pull the plough. The &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; states that Nargis symbolised mothers in &quot;which all the mothers [in later films] had the same clichéd roles to play. Representing both motherhood and Mother Earth, who also nurtures and occasionally punishes, Nargis immortalised the Indian mother on celluloid.&quot; The film pioneered the portrayal of two morally opposed brothers personifying good and evil, which became a repeated motif in Hindi films, including &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; (1961) and &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975). The rebellious Birju also inspired the &quot;angry young man&quot; stock character that arose in 1970s Hindi cinema. According to scholar Brigitte Schulze, &quot;Mother India&quot; played a key role in shaping the young Republic of India&#x27;s national identity in its early years following independence from the British Raj, due to how the film was able to successfully convey a sense of Indian nationalism to the urban and rural masses.

<text>Louis &quot;Studs&quot; Terkel (May 16, 1912 – October 31, 2008) was an American writer, historian, actor, and broadcaster. He received the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1985 for &quot;The Good War&quot; and is best remembered for his oral histories of common Americans, and for hosting a long-running radio show in Chicago.

==Early life==
Terkel was born to Russian Jewish immigrants, Samuel Terkel, a tailor, and Anna (Annie) Finkel, a seamstress, in New York City. At the age of eight, he moved with his family to Chicago, Illinois, where he spent most of his life. He had two brothers, Meyer (1905–1958) and Ben (1907–1965). He attended McKinley High School.

From 1926 to 1936, his parents ran a rooming house called the Wells-Grand Hotel that also served as a meeting place for people from all walks of life. Terkel credited his understanding of humanity and social interaction to the tenants and visitors who gathered in the lobby there and the people who congregated in nearby Bughouse Square.

In 1939, he married Ida Goldberg (1912–1999), and the couple had one son. Although he received his undergraduate degree in 1932 and a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago in 1934 (and was admitted to the Illinois Bar the following year), he decided that, instead of practicing law, he wanted to be a concierge at a hotel, and he soon joined a theater group.

==Career==
A political leftist, Terkel joined the Works Progress Administration&#x27;s Federal Writers&#x27; Project, working in radio, doing work that varied from voicing soap opera productions and announcing news and sports to presenting shows of recorded music and writing radio scripts and advertisements. In the late 1940&#x27;s he voiced characters in WMAQ&#x27;s &quot;Destination Freedom&quot; series, written by Richard Durham. His own well-known radio program, titled &quot;The Studs Terkel Program&quot;, aired on 98.7 WFMT Chicago between 1952 and 1997. The one-hour program was broadcast each weekday during those 45 years. On this program, he interviewed guests as diverse as Martin Luther King Jr., Leonard Bernstein, Mort Sahl, Bob Dylan, Alexander Frey, Dorothy Parker, Tennessee Williams, Jean Shepherd, Frank Zappa, and Big Bill Broonzy.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Terkel was also the central character of &quot;Studs&#x27; Place&quot;, an unscripted television drama about the owner of a greasy-spoon diner in Chicago through which many famous people and interesting characters passed. This show, Marlin Perkins&#x27;s &quot;Zoo Parade&quot;, &quot;Garroway at Large&quot;, and the children&#x27;s show &quot;Kukla, Fran, and Ollie&quot; are widely considered canonical examples of the Chicago School of Television.

Terkel published his first book, &quot;Giants of Jazz&quot;, in 1956. He followed it in 1967 with his first collection of oral histories, &quot;Division Street: America&quot;, with 70 people talking about the effect on the human spirit of living in an American metropolis.

He also served as a distinguished scholar-in-residence at the Chicago History Museum. He appeared in the film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, based on the Black Sox Scandal, in which he played newspaper reporter Hugh Fullerton, who tries to uncover the White Sox players&#x27; plans to throw the 1919 World Series. Terkel found it particularly amusing to play this role, as he was a big fan of the Chicago White Sox (as well as a vocal critic of major league baseball during the 1994 baseball strike), and gave a moving congratulatory speech to the White Sox organization after their 2005 World Series championship during a television interview.

Terkel received his nickname while he was acting in a play with another person named Louis. To keep the two straight, the director of the production gave Terkel the nickname &quot;Studs&quot; after the fictional character about whom Terkel was reading at the time—Studs Lonigan, of James T. Farrell&#x27;s trilogy.

Terkel was acclaimed for his efforts to preserve American oral history. His 1985 book &quot;&quot;The Good War&quot;: An Oral History of World War Two&quot;, which detailed ordinary peoples&#x27; accounts of the country&#x27;s involvement in World War II, won the Pulitzer Prize. For &quot;Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression&quot;, Terkel assembled recollections of the Great Depression that spanned the socioeconomic spectrum, from Okies, through prison inmates, to the wealthy. His 1974 book, &quot;Working&quot;, in which (as reflected by its subtitle) &quot;People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do&quot;, also was highly acclaimed. &quot;Working&quot; was made into a short-lived Broadway show of the same title in 1978 and was telecast on PBS in 1982. In 1995, he received the Chicago History Museum &quot;Making History Award&quot; for Distinction in Journalism and Communications. In 1997, Terkel was elected a member of The American Academy of Arts and Letters. Two years later, he received the George Polk Career Award in 1999.

==Later life==
In 2004, Terkel received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College. In August 2005, Terkel underwent successful open-heart surgery. At the age of 93, he was one of the oldest people to undergo this form of surgery and doctors reported his recovery to be remarkable for someone of that advanced age. Terkel smoked two cigars a day until 2004.

On May 22, 2006, Terkel, along with other plaintiffs, including Quentin Young, filed suit in federal district court against AT&amp;T Inc., to stop the telecommunications carrier from giving customer telephone records to the National Security Agency without a court order.

The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Matthew F. Kennelly on July 26, 2006. Judge Kennelly cited a &quot;state secrets privilege&quot; designed to protect the government from being harmed by lawsuits.

In an interview in &quot;The Guardian&quot; celebrating his 95th birthday, Terkel discussed his own &quot;diverse and idiosyncratic taste in music, from Bob Dylan to Alexander Frey, Louis Armstrong to Woody Guthrie&quot;.

Terkel published a new personal memoir entitled &quot;Touch and Go&quot; in fall 2007.

Terkel was a self-described agnostic, which he jokingly defined as &quot;a cowardly atheist&quot; during a 2004 interview with Krista Tippett on American Public Media&#x27;s &quot;Speaking of Faith&quot;.

One of his last interviews was for the documentary &quot;Soul of a People&quot; on Smithsonian Channel. He spoke about his participation in the Works Progress Administration.

At his last public appearance, in 2007, Terkel said he was &quot;still in touch—but ready to go&quot;. He gave one of his last interviews on the BBC &quot;HARDtalk&quot; program on February 4, 2008. He spoke of the imminent election of Barack Obama as President of the United States, and offered him some advice, in October 2008.

Terkel died in his Chicago home on Friday, October 31, 2008, at the age of 96. He had been suffering since a fall in his home earlier that month.

==Legacy and audio recordings==

From a donation by Terkel, the Chicago History Museum, Library of Congress, and WFMT created the Studs Terkel Radio Archive, digitally preserving his entire interview archive − &quot;a remarkably rich history of the ideas and perspectives of both common and influential people living in the second half of the 20th century,&quot; per the Library of Congress.

&quot;For Studs, there was not a voice that should not be heard, a story that could not be told,&quot; said Gary T. Johnson, Museum president. &quot;He believed that everyone had the right to be heard and had something important to say. He was there to listen, to chronicle, and to make sure their stories are remembered.&quot;
On September 5, 2019, podcast &quot;The Radio Diaries&quot;, produced by Radiotopia on PRX, released an episode called &quot;The Working Tapes of Studs Terkel.&quot; In it, Terkel&#x27;s taped interviews with working people are played and examined.

==Awards and honors==
In 1982, Terkel was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Illinois at Chicago.

In 1985, Terkel received the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction for his book &quot;The Good War&quot;.

Bill Clinton, then the President of the United States, awarded Terkel the National Humanities Medal in 1997.

The National Book Foundation awarded Terkel the 1997 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.

In 2001, Terkel was made an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Northwestern University.

In 2001, Terkel was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community.

In 2004, Terkel was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the &quot;Order of Lincoln&quot; (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in the area of Communications.

In 2006, Terkel received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, the first and only annual U.S. literary award recognizing the power of the written word to promote peace.

In 2010, Terkel was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.

Terkel was a recipient of the 1999 George Polk Career Award and the National Book Critics Circle 2003 Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award.

Terkel, despite not being black, was inducted into Chicago State University&#x27;s National Literary Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent at the insistence of Professor Haki Madhubuti.

<text>The National Anthem of Guatemala () was an initiative of the government of General José María Reina Barrios. Its music was composed by and its original lyrics written by Cuban poet and diplomat José Joaquín Palma, in the context of the cultural and industrial event Exposición Centroamericana of 1897. 

The anthem was particularly warmongering and reflected the Cuban War of Independence more than the independence of Central America. Due to this, by a 1934 order of President Jorge Ubico some changes to the lyrics were made by pedagogue José María Bonilla Ruano.

The lyrics and score were printed for the first time in the culture magazine &quot;La Ilustración Guatemalteca&quot;, where the original author of the lyrics appeared as &quot;Anonymous&quot;. It was not until 1910, shortly before his death, that Palma confessed being the author. 

==History==
=== Origins ===
In 1879, the El Porvenir Literary Society unsuccessfully attempted to create a national anthem for Guatemala. In 1887, the president of Guatemala, General Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, called for a competition to choose music that would complement the lyrics of the &quot;&quot; written by poet Ramón P. Molina. Distinguished composers took part in this competition, and the triumph was awarded to music presented by .

=== Competition organized by Reina Barrios ===

In 1896, the government of General José María Reina Barrios called for a new competition, &quot;considering that Guatemala lacks a National Anthem, since the one known to this day by that name not only suffers from notable defects, but also has not been officially declared as such; and that it is convenient to provide the country with an anthem that, through its lyrics and music, responds to the lofty purposes for which all educated people lend this kind of composition.&quot; In this new competition, Rafael Álvarez Ovalle&#x27;s work was chosen again, this time musicalising a poem written under the pseudonym &quot;Anonymous&quot;.

The victory granted again to the teacher Álvarez Ovalle cost him the most bitter moments of his existence, as there was discontent among those who did not win, who even sent their complaint to the president. Reina Barrios, in the presence of the members of his cabinet, other figures and teachers of musical art, listened again to all the compositions that competed in the competition, and Álvarez Ovalle&#x27;s was unanimously selected again.

With respect to the lyrics, the qualifying jury determined the following:

As can be seen, Cuban poet José Joaquín Palma was a member of the qualifying jury.

Palma&#x27;s lyrics were officially adopted on 28 October 1896, while Álvarez Ovalle&#x27;s music was officially adopted on 19 February 1897. The premiere of the National Anthem took place in the literary lyrical act held at the Colón Theatre on the night of Sunday, 14 March 1897, as one of the main points of the programme of celebrations of the Exposición Centroamericana, with Álvarez Ovalle being decorated with a medal of gold and diploma of honor.

=== Palma confesses to being the author ===
The author of the lyrics of the National Anthem of Guatemala remained a deep mystery until 1910, when it was discovered that its author was Cuban poet José Joaquín Palma, since he revealed on his deathbed that he was the author of the lyrics of the anthem. The government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera awarded both him and Rafael Álvarez Ovalle with gold laurel wreaths at the that year.

==Lyrics ==
=== Original lyrics (1897–1934) ===


The original lyrics of the Guatemalan anthem written by José Joaquín Palma were warlike, since Palma was inspired more by the political situation his native Cuba was going through than that Guatemala experienced during its independence: while Central America separated from Spanish Empire peacefully, Cuba was waging a fierce war against Spain at the time Palma wrote the anthem.

=== Current lyrics (1934–present) ===
For not reflecting Guatemalan reality, Palma&#x27;s lyrics were modified by Guatemalan poet and pedagogue José María Bonilla Ruano in 1934, according to the Government Decree of 26 July 1934 by the government of General Jorge Ubico Castañeda. These are the lyrics sung today.

=== Certifications ===
The National Anthem of Guatemala has been considered by Carlos Labin, a member of the Americanist Society of Paris and the Musicology Society of France, as the &quot;most original&quot; of all the anthems of the American continent.

<text>Fabbrica d&#x27;Armi Pietro Beretta (; &quot;Pietro Beretta Weapons Factory&quot;) is a privately held Italian firearms manufacturing company operating in several countries. Its firearms are used worldwide for various civilian, law enforcement, and military purposes. Sporting arms account for three-quarters of sales; Beretta is also known for marketing shooting clothes and accessories. Founded in 1526, Beretta is the oldest active firearm manufacturer and one of the oldest continuously operating companies in the world. Its inaugural product was the arquebus barrel; by all accounts Beretta-made barrels equipped the Venetian fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. Beretta has supplied weapons for every major European war since 1650.

==History==


Val Trompia, a northern Italian river valley in the Province of Brescia, Lombardy, has been mined for iron ore since the time of the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages, Val Trompia was known for its ironworks; after the Renaissance, it came to be a center for the manufacture of weapons. By the mid-16th century, Val Trompia had forty ironworks supplied by fifty mines and eight smelters. The birthplace of Beretta is in the village of Gardone, located on the banks of the Mella river in the middle of Val Trompia (i.e., between the upper and lower valley).

The Beretta forge was in operation from about 1500, although the first documented transaction is a contract dated 3 October 1526, for 185 arquebus barrels, for which the Republic of Venice was to pay 296 ducats to &quot;Maestro di Canne&quot; (master gun-barrel maker) Bartolomeo Beretta . The original account document for the order of those barrels is now stored in the &quot;Archivio di Stato di Venezia&quot; in Venice. By the end of the 17th century, Beretta had become the second largest gun barrel maker in Gardone.

Under the guild system, the knowledge of gun barrel fabrication that had been bequeathed to Jacopo (1520/25 – ...) by his father Bartolomeo (1490 – 1565/68) was then passed down to Jacopo&#x27;s son, Giovannino (1550 – post-1577), and then to his grandson Giovan Antonio (1577 – post-1649), and it continued to be passed down in this manner until guilds were abolished by Napoleon after his conquest of the Venetian Republic in 1797.

The same family has owned Beretta for almost five hundred years; it is a founding member of Les Henokiens, an association of bicentenary companies that are family-owned and operated.

In 1918, the Beretta Model 1918, one of the first submachine guns in the world, was fielded by the Italian army. Beretta manufactured rifles and pistols for the Italian military until the 1943 Armistice between Italy and the Allied forces during World War II. Once the Wehrmacht controlled northern Italy, the Germans seized Beretta and continued using it to produce arms until the 1945 German surrender in Italy. During that time, the quality of the exterior finish of the weapons diminished—-late-war specimens were much inferior to both the pre-war and mid-war weapons—-but their efficacy remained excellent. The last shipment of Type I Rifles left Venice for Japan in a U-boat in 1942.

After World War II, Beretta repaired the American M1 Garands that the U.S. had given Italy. Beretta modified the M1 into the Beretta BM-59 rifle, which is similar to the M14 battle rifle. Armourers consider the BM-59 rifle to be superior to the M14 rifle in some ways because it is more accurate under certain conditions.

After the war, Beretta continued to develop firearms for the Italian army and police force, as well as the civilian market.

In the 1970s, Beretta also started a manufacturing plant in São Paulo, Brazil. A contract between Beretta and the Brazilian government was signed, under which Beretta produced Beretta 92s for the Brazilian army until 1980. Later this plant was sold to Taurus, who continues to manufacture the Beretta 92 under the name of PT92 using the same tools and labour that Beretta used, without the need for a license from Beretta, since the design is based on the original Beretta 92, for which the patents have expired.

In the late 1980s, Beretta acquired several domestic competitors (notably Benelli and Franchi) and some foreign companies (notably in Finland).

Also in the 1980s, Beretta enjoyed a renewal of popularity in North America after its Beretta 92 pistol was selected as the service handgun for the United States Army (as the &quot;M9 pistol&quot;). In 1993, a Beretta USA executive revealed that it had been the company&#x27;s strategy since 1980 &quot;to use the military contract to make Beretta a household name in the United States&quot;, and then to expand into more prominent law enforcement and commercial markets.

==Overview==

Today, Fabbrica d&#x27;Armi Pietro Beretta (Beretta S.p.A.) is run by Franco Gussalli Beretta, President and CEO.

The traditional father-to-son Beretta dynasty was interrupted when Ugo Gussalli Beretta assumed control. Uncles Carlo and Giuseppe Beretta were childless. Ugo married into the Beretta family and adopted the last name Beretta. His sons are now direct descendants through their mother&#x27;s side of the family.

Beretta is known for its broad range of firearms: side-by-side shotguns, over-and-under shotguns, semi-automatic shotguns, hunting rifles, express rifles, assault rifles, submachine guns, lever- and bolt-action rifles, single- and double-action revolvers and semi-automatic pistols. The parent company, Beretta Holding, also owns Beretta USA, Benelli, Franchi, SAKO, Stoeger, Tikka, Uberti, and the Burris Optics company.

The model Beretta 92FS was the primary side arm of the United States Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force, designated the M9 pistol. In 1985, Beretta was chosen after a controversial competition to produce the M9, winning a contract for 500,000 pistols. A condition of the original agreement was domestic manufacture of the M9. In 2019, the 9mm version of the SIG Sauer P320 was selected to replace the M9 throughout the U.S. Armed Forces.

<text>Lethal Weapon is a 1987 American action film directed by Richard Donner and written by Shane Black. It stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover alongside Gary Busey, Tom Atkins, Darlene Love, and Mitchell Ryan. In &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, a pair of mismatched LAPD detectives—Martin Riggs (Gibson), a former Green Beret who has become suicidal following the death of his wife, and veteran officer and family man Roger Murtaugh (Glover)—work together as partners.

The film was released on March 6, 1987. Upon its release, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; grossed over $120 million (against a production budget of $15 million) and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound. It spawned a franchise that includes three sequels and a television series, with a fourth sequel in development.

==Plot==

Following the recent death of his wife, Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) narcotics Sergeant Martin Riggs, a former Special Forces soldier, has become suicidal and erratic. Despite the protests of the police therapist, the captain believes Riggs is faking his psychosis to be forcibly retired with a generous pension, and partners him with fellow war veteran and seasoned Homicide Sergeant Roger Murtaugh. Riggs and Murtaugh do not get along well at first as Murtaugh is equally dismissive of Riggs&#x27;s mental state, but is eventually convinced Riggs is truly suicidal.

Murtaugh is contacted by a former Vietnam War friend, Michael Hunsaker, ostensibly to help his daughter Amanda escape her life of prostitution and pornography, but Amanda kills herself by jumping from an apartment balcony before she and Murtaugh meet. Her autopsy shows she was fatally poisoned with tainted drugs, indicating she was potentially murdered. Riggs and Murtaugh attempt to question her pimp, but are assaulted after finding drugs on the premises, forcing Riggs to kill the pimp to save Murtaugh&#x27;s life. Their final lead is Dixie, a prostitute who witnessed Amanda&#x27;s death, and whom the pair believe may have poisoned her. Dixie&#x27;s home explodes as they arrive and her corpse is later recovered. Riggs locates components of a mercury switch explosive among the debris, a specialty explosive he recalls being used by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) mercenaries in Vietnam. The suspect is detailed by neighborhood children, who noticed he had an elite special forces tattoo similar to Riggs&#x27;s.

Suspecting Hunsaker is withholding information, Riggs and Murtaugh visit him at Amanda&#x27;s funeral. He reveals that during the Vietnam War he worked for &quot;Shadow Company&quot;, a defunct CIA paramilitary unit tasked with destabilizing the local heroin trade. Following the war, the ex-CIA agents, mercenaries, and soldiers involved reformed Shadow Company as a criminal organization and began shipping large quantities of heroin from Asia to the United States, under the leadership of retired General Peter McAllister and his right-hand man Mr. Joshua. Hunsaker&#x27;s role as a banker allowed him to make the illicit funds seem legitimate. He initially called Murtaugh to confess and turn witness against Shadow Company, but McAllister had Amanda killed in retaliation. Joshua arrives in a helicopter and kills Hunsaker before escaping. He later attempts to kill Riggs in a drive-by shooting, but the latter is saved by his bulletproof vest; Riggs&#x27;s death is faked to give the pair an advantage.

Concerned Murtaugh knows too much, Shadow Company kidnaps his daughter Rianne and forces Murtaugh to meet them at El Mirage Lake. Riggs provides sniper support to help Murtaugh and Rianne escape, but all three are captured and recovered to a nightclub basement, a Shadow Company front. Riggs and Murtaugh are tortured for information until Riggs escapes, kills several Shadow Company members, and frees Murtaugh and Rianne. Although Joshua escapes, Murtaugh kills McAllister. Deducing Joshua will seek revenge at Murtaugh&#x27;s home, Riggs and Murtaugh ambush him. Riggs defeats Joshua in a brawl, but chooses not to kill him. Police officers take Joshua into custody, but he breaks free, takes an officer&#x27;s gun, and attempts to shoot Riggs and Murtaugh; the pair return fire and kill Joshua.

A short time later, after visiting his wife&#x27;s grave, Riggs shares Christmas Day dinner with Murtaugh and his family. He gifts Murtaugh a hollow-point bullet he has been saving to commit suicide, as he no longer needs it.

* Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh
* Gary Busey as Mr. Joshua

==Production==

===Development===
Recent UCLA graduate Shane Black wrote the screenplay in mid-1985. Black stated that his intention was to do an &quot;urban western&quot; inspired by &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; where a violent character &quot;reviled for what he did, what he is capable of, the things he believed in&quot; is eventually recruited for being the one that could solve the problem. The protagonists would be everymen policemen, &quot;guys shuffling in a town like Los Angeles searching for something noble as justice when they&#x27;re just guys in washed and worn suits seeking a paycheck&quot;.

According to Black, his original first draft of the script was very different and much darker than the final film. It was 140 pages long and both the plot and characters were different, and action scenes were also much bigger. The ending of the script contained a chase scene with helicopters and a trailer truck full of cocaine exploding over Hollywood Hills with cocaine snowing over the Hollywood sign. Black hated this first draft and initially discarded it but later picked it up again and re-wrote it into the new drafts that were eventually used for filming.

His agent sent the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; script to various studios, being rejected before Warner Bros. executive Mark Canton took a liking to it. Canton brought along producer Joel Silver, who loved the story and worked with Black to further develop the script. Writer Jeffrey Boam also did some uncredited re-writes on Black&#x27;s script after complaints that parts of it were too dark. Boam added more humor to the script, and later did a complete re-write of Shane Black and Warren Murphy&#x27;s rejected script for the second film. He also wrote the script for the third film and an unused draft for the fourth film.

After the script was purchased for $250,000, studio production executives offered it to director Richard Donner, who also loved it. Leonard Nimoy was among the directors considered for the project, but he did not feel comfortable doing action films, and he was working on &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; at the time.

===Casting===
Donner, having just finished filming &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;, had long been interested in working with Gibson. Casting director Marion Dougherty first suggested teaming Gibson with Danny Glover, given Murtaugh had no set ethnicity in the script. She arranged for Gibson to fly in from his home in Sydney while Glover was flown in from Chicago, where he was appearing in a play, to read through the script. Bruce Willis was approached for the role of Riggs, but turned it down as he found the script &quot;too violent&quot;. This is referenced in the spoof of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; films, &quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot;; Bruce (as John McClane) appears after the villains attack the wrong beach residence, looking for the protagonist. Christopher Lambert and Christopher Reeve were both approached, but neither was interested. Michael Biehn was also a brief contender to play Riggs as Donner had enjoyed his performance in &quot;The Terminator&quot;, but he was already committed to &quot;Aliens&quot;. Other actors that were considered for the role included Pierce Brosnan, Stephen Lang, Ron Perlman, Michael Nouri, Sylvester Stallone, Patrick Swayze, Michael Douglas, Jeff Goldblum and Kurt Russell. 

According to Donner: &quot;It took about two hours and by the time we were done, I was in seventh heaven. They found innuendoes; they found laughter where I never saw it; they found tears where they didn&#x27;t exist before; and, most importantly, they found a relationship—all in just one reading. So if you ask about casting... it was magical, just total dynamite&quot;.

Gibson said that &quot;this particular story was a cut above others I had passed on, because the action is really a sideline which heightens the story of these two great characters. I picture Riggs as an almost Chaplinesque figure, a guy who doesn&#x27;t expect anything from life and even toys with the idea of taking his own. He&#x27;s not like these stalwarts who come down from Mt. Olympus and wreak havoc and go away. He&#x27;s somebody who doesn&#x27;t look like he&#x27;s set to go off until he actually does&quot;.

The draw for Glover was equally strong. Fresh from his success as Mister in &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, he felt the role of Roger Murtaugh offered a whole new range of character expression and experience: &quot;Aside from the chance to work with Mel, which turned out to be pure pleasure, one of the reasons I jumped at this project was the family aspect. The chance to play intricate relationships and subtle humor that exist in every close family group was an intriguing challenge, as was playing a guy turning 50. Murtaugh&#x27;s a little cranky about his age until everything he loves is threatened. His reawakening parallels Riggs&#x27;&quot;.

Both actors were signed by early spring 1986. Gibson and Glover then flew home to pack, and, returning to Los Angeles, began an intensive two months of physical training and preparation. Meanwhile, the crucial role of Mr. Joshua was settled when Gary Busey asked to read for the part. An established star since his Academy Award-nominated performance in &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;, Busey had not auditioned for a film in years but was suffering from a career slump; he credited &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; with reviving his stardom. In Busey&#x27;s comment: &quot;I had butterflies, I&#x27;d never played a bad guy. And no one had seen me since I&#x27;d lost 60 pounds and got back into shape. But I decided to take the initiative in order to have the opportunity to work with Dick, Joel, Mel, and Danny. I&#x27;m constantly looking for someone to pull the best performance out of me and any of those guys could. They even talked me into dyeing my hair!&quot; In his &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; biography, Busey says he was hired to play Joshua because the producers were looking for someone big and menacing enough to be a believable foe for the imposing Gibson.

===Pre-production===
Stunt coordinator Bobby Bass planned and supervised all phases of Gibson&#x27;s and Glover&#x27;s intense pre-production training; physical conditioning, weight workouts, and weapons handling and safety. Bass also used his own military experiences to bring a greater depth of understanding to the Riggs character. To familiarize the actors with the specialized skills and sensibilities acquired by undercover cops, arrangements were made for Gibson and Glover to spend time in the field accompanying working LAPD officers. Throughout filming, technical advisers from the LAPD as well as the LA County Sheriff&#x27;s Department worked closely with Donner and the actors to ensure authenticity.
Cedric Adams was the first technical adviser brought in. Donner said that &quot;Adams thought the best possible way to show just how lethal Riggs really is—is to show his mastery of a form of martial arts never before seen onscreen&quot;. Donner wanted Riggs&#x27;s style of fighting to be unique with the second assistant director Willie Simmons, who was interested in unusual forms of martial arts, choosing three martial arts styles. Gibson and Busey were instructed in Capoeira by Adams, Jailhouse rock by Dennis Newsome and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu by Rorion Gracie. Bobby Bass, the stunt coordinator, a former US Army Special Forces instructor and judo champion, also provided training in various techniques. At one point, the actors trained in between filming, for four hours a day for six weeks and did months of choreography.

===Filming===
An alternate opening and ending were both filmed and can be seen on the &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; DVD. The alternate opening featured Martin Riggs drinking alone in a bar where he is accosted by a couple of thugs who attack him for his money, but are easily subdued by Riggs. Director Richard Donner felt the film should open with a brighter look at Riggs, and replaced the bar scene with the scene in which Riggs awakens in his trailer. The alternate ending featured Riggs telling Murtaugh not to retire. Without even thinking about the possibility of sequels, Donner decided that Riggs and Murtaugh&#x27;s relationship is one of friendship, and filmed the ending that appears in the completed film. 

In addition to the film&#x27;s theatrical release, an extended Director&#x27;s Cut version was released later on DVD. The Director&#x27;s Cut version is longer (117 minutes) than the original theatrical release version (110 minutes), and features additional scenes. One extended scene depicts Riggs dispatching a sniper who had been firing at children in a playground. In another scene, Riggs picks up a street-walking prostitute, but instead of having sex with her, he takes her home to watch &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; on TV, thus illustrating his loneliness following the death of his wife.

===Music===

Michael Kamen, who just completed work on &quot;Highlander&quot;, composed the score for &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;. Editor Stuart Baird had used Edge of Darkness heavily as a temp score for the film, resulting in Kamen being brought on to create the score. The guitar part of Riggs&#x27;s theme was performed by Eric Clapton. Kamen and Clapton had worked together on the music for the 1985 BBC TV series &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (the feature adaptation of which would later, by coincidence, star Mel Gibson). The saxophone part of Murtaugh&#x27;s theme was performed by David Sanborn. The Christmas song &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot;, performed by Bobby Helms, is played during the film&#x27;s opening credits. Honeymoon Suite&#x27;s song, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, is played during the film&#x27;s end credits without being credited.

==Release==
===Box office===

&quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; was released in the United States and Canada on March 6, 1987. During its opening weekend it grossed a total of $6.8million from 1,256 theaters—an average of $5,437 per theater—making it the highest grossing film of the weekend, ahead of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; ($6.7million) in its second week of release, and &quot;Platoon&quot; ($6.1million) in its twelfth. In its second weekend, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; retained the number 1 position with a $7.1million gross—a 4% increase from the previous week—still ahead of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; ($5million) and &quot;Platoon&quot; ($4.7million). 

&quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; remained the number 1 film in its third weekend with a $6.3million gross, ahead of the debuting &quot;Burglar&quot; ($4.5million), and &quot;Platoon&quot; ($3.8million). &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; fell to number 2 in its fourth weekend with a gross of $5million, behind the debut of &quot;Blind Date&quot; ($7.5million). &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; spent 13 weeks among the top ten highest-grossing films. In total, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; grossed $65.2million in the United States and Canada, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1987.

Outside of the United States and Canada, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; is estimated to have earned a further $55million. It saw some of its most success in Gibson&#x27;s home country of Australia. This figure gives &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; a total worldwide gross of $120.2million.

===Home media===
&quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; has been released on Betamax, VHS and DVD numerous times, along with a single Blu-ray Disc release. The first DVD was released in 1997 and featured the film&#x27;s theatrical version. The Director&#x27;s Cut was released in 2000. Since then, numerous sets have been released that contain all four films in the series (featuring the same DVDs). The theatrical version was also released on Blu-ray in 2006.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Lethal Weapon is a film teetering on the brink of absurdity when it gets serious, but thanks to its unrelenting energy and insistent drive, it never quite falls.&quot; Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; called it &quot;Mad Max meets The Cosby Show&quot;, saying that it works better than expected. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described it as &quot;a vivid, visceral reminder of just how exciting an action film can be&quot;. At &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;The film is all fast action, noisy stunts and huge, often unflattering close-ups, but it packs an undeniable wallop.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, saying Donner &quot;tops himself&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing (Les Fresholtz, Dick Alexander, Vern Poore and Bill Nelson) (losing to &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;).

==Reboot==
In 2011, Warner Bros. announced it would reboot the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; franchise without Gibson and Glover. The new franchise was set to feature the same characters but a brand-new cast. Will Beall was hired to write the script, but was eventually cancelled. A television version premiered in September 2016 on Fox starring Clayne Crawford as Martin Riggs, Damon Wayans as Roger Murtaugh, and Thomas Lennon as Leo Getz.

<text>Neutropenia is an abnormally low concentration of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood. Neutrophils make up the majority of circulating white blood cells and serve as the primary defense against infections by destroying bacteria, bacterial fragments and immunoglobulin-bound viruses in the blood. People with neutropenia are more susceptible to bacterial infections and, without prompt medical attention, the condition may become life-threatening (neutropenic sepsis).

Neutropenia can be divided into congenital and acquired, with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and cyclic neutropenia (CyN) being autosomal dominant and mostly caused by heterozygous mutations in the ELANE gene (neutrophil elastase). Neutropenia can be acute (temporary) or chronic (long lasting). The term is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;leukopenia&quot; (&quot;deficit in the number of white blood cells&quot;).

Decreased production of neutrophils is associated with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and folic acid, aplastic anemia, tumors, drugs, metabolic disease, nutritional deficiencies (including minerals such as copper), and immune mechanisms. In general, the most common oral manifestations of neutropenia include ulcer, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Agranulocytosis can be presented as whitish or greyish necrotic ulcer in the oral cavity, without any sign of inflammation. Acquired agranulocytosis is much more common than the congenital form. The common causes of acquired agranulocytosis including drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiepileptics, antithyroid, and antibiotics) and viral infection. Agranulocytosis has a mortality rate of 7–10%. To manage this, the application of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte transfusion and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to protect against bacterial infections are recommended.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms of neutropenia include fever, painful swallowing, gingival pain, skin abscesses, and otitis. These symptoms may exist because individuals with neutropenia often have infection.

Children may show signs of irritability and poor feeding. Hypotension has also been observed in individuals with this condition.
==Causes==

The causes of neutropenia can be divided between problems that are &quot;transient&quot; and those that are &quot;chronic&quot;. Causes can be divided into these groups:
Severe bacterial infections, especially in people with underlying hematological diseases or alcoholism, can deplete neutrophil reserves and lead to neutropenia. Gram-positive bacteria are present in 60–70% of bacterial infections. There are serious concerns regarding antibiotic-resistant organisms. These would include as methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).

Nutritional deficiencies, such as deficiency in vitamin B12, folate, copper or protein-calorie malnutrition are associated with chronic neutropenia. However, nutritional deficiencies are usually associated with decreases in other cell lines (multiple cytopenia or pancytopenia) rather than isolated neutropenia.

Other causes of congenital neutropenia are Shwachman–Diamond syndrome, Cyclic neutropenia, bone marrow failure syndromes, cartilage–hair hypoplasia, reticular dysgenesis, and Barth syndrome. Viruses that infect neutrophil progenitors can also be the cause of neutropenia. Viruses identified that have an effect on neutrophils are rubella and cytomegalovirus. Though the body can manufacture a normal level of neutrophils, in some cases the destruction of excessive numbers of neutrophils can lead to neutropenia. These are:
==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of neutropenia can be divided into &quot;congenital&quot; and &quot;acquired&quot;. The congenital neutropenia (severe and cyclic type) is autosomal dominant, with mutations in the ELA2 gene (neutrophil elastase) as the most common genetic reason for this condition. Acquired neutropenia (immune-associated neutropenia) is due to anti-neutrophil antibodies that target neutrophil-specific antigens, ultimately altering neutrophil function. Furthermore, emerging research suggests neutropenia without an identifiable etiology (idiopathic neutropenia) may be the result of a low-grade, chronic inflammatory process with an abnormal excessive production of myelosuppressive cytokines in a study conducted in the island of Crete.

Neutropenia fever can complicate the treatment of cancers. Observations of children noted that fungal infections are more likely to develop in those with neutropenia. Mortality increases during cancer treatments if neutropenia is also present.
Congenital neutropenia is determined by blood neutrophil counts (absolute neutrophil counts or ANC) &lt; 0.5 × 10/L and recurrent bacterial infections beginning very early in childhood. Congenital neutropenia is related to alloimmunization, sepsis, maternal hypertension, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, and Rh hemolytic disease.

==Diagnosis==
Neutropenia can be the result of a variety of consequences, including taking certain types of drugs, exposure to environmental toxins, vitamin deficiencies, metabolic abnormalities, as well as cancer, viral or bacterial infections. Neutropenia itself is a rare entity, but can be clinically common in oncology and immunocompromised individuals as a result of chemotherapy (drug-induced neutropenia). Additionally, acute neutropenia can be commonly seen from people recovering from a viral infection or in a post-viral state. Meanwhile, several subtypes of neutropenia exist which are rarer and chronic, including acquired (idiopathic) neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, autoimmune neutropenia, and congenital neutropenia.

Neutropenia that is developed in response to chemotherapy typically becomes evident in seven to fourteen days after treatment, this period is known as the nadir or &quot;low point&quot;. Conditions that indicate the presence of neutropenic fever are implanted devices; leukemia induction; the compromise of mucosal, mucociliary and cutaneous barriers; a rapid decline in absolute neutrophil count, duration of neutropenia &gt;7–10 days, and other illnesses that exist in the patient.

Signs of infection can be subtle. Fevers are a common and early observation. Sometimes overlooked is the presence of hypothermia, which can be present in sepsis. Physical examination and accessing the history and physical examination is focused on sites of infection. Indwelling line sites, areas of skin breakdown, sinuses, nasopharynx, bronchi and lungs, alimentary tract, and skin are assessed.

The diagnosis of neutropenia is done via the low neutrophil count detection on a complete blood count. Generally, other investigations are required to arrive at the right diagnosis. When the diagnosis is uncertain, or serious causes are suspected, bone marrow biopsy may be necessary. A bone marrow biopsy can identify abnormalities in myelopoesis contributing to neutropenia such as the stage of arrest in the development of myeloid progenitor cells. Bone marrow biopsies can also be used to monitor the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with chronic neutropenia (especially in those with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) which carries a higher risk of MDS and AML)). Other investigations commonly performed: serial neutrophil counts for suspected cyclic neutropenia, tests for antineutrophil antibodies, autoantibody screen (and investigations for systemic lupus erythematosus), vitamin B12 and folate assays. Rectal examinations are usually not performed due to the increased risk of introducing bacteria into the blood stream and the possible development of rectal abscesses.

===Classification===

Generally accepted reference range for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in adults is 1500 to 8000 cells per microliter (μL) of blood. Three general guidelines are used to classify the severity of neutropenia based on the ANC (expressed below in cells/μL):
* Mild neutropenia (1000 &lt;= ANC &lt; 1500): minimal risk of infection
* Moderate neutropenia (500 &lt;= ANC &lt; 1000): moderate risk of infection
* Severe neutropenia (ANC &lt; 500): severe risk of infection.

Each of these are either derived from laboratory tests or via the formula below:

ANC = formula_1

==Treatment==
A fever, when combined with profound neutropenia (febrile neutropenia), is considered a medical emergency and requires broad spectrum antibiotics. An absolute neutrophil count less than 200 is also considered a medical emergency and almost always requires hospital admission and initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics with selection of specific antibiotics based on local resistance patterns.Precautions to avoid opportunistic infections in those with chronic neutropenia include maintaining proper soap and water hand hygiene, good dental hygiene and avoiding highly contaminated sources that may contain a large fungal reservoirs such as mulch, construction sites and bird or other animal waste.

Neutropenia can be treated with the hematopoietic growth factor granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). These are cytokines that are present naturally in the body. The factors promote neutrophil recovery following anticancer therapy or in chronic neutropenia. Recombinant G-CSF factor preparations, such as filgrastim can be effective in people with congenital forms of neutropenia including severe congenital neutropenia and cyclic neutropenia; the amount needed (dosage) to stabilize the neutrophil count varies considerably (depending on the individual&#x27;s condition). Guidelines for neutropenia regarding diet are currently being studied. Those who have chronic neutropenia and fail to respond to G-CSF or who have an increased risk of developing MDS or AML (due to increased dosage requirements of G-CSF or having abnormal precursor cells in the bone marrow) often require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a treatment.

Most cases of neonatal neutropenia are temporary. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended because of the possibility of encouraging the development of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains.

These are cytokines that are present naturally in the body. The factors promote neutrophil recovery following anticancer therapy.

The administration of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) has had some success in treating neutropenias of alloimmune and autoimmune origins with a response rate of about 50%. Blood transfusions have not been effective.

Patients with neutropenia caused by cancer treatment can be given antifungal drugs. A Cochrane review found that lipid formulations of amphotericin B had fewer side effects than conventional amphotericin B, though it is not clear whether there are particular advantages over conventional amphotericin B if given under optimal circumstances. Another Cochrane review was not able to detect a difference in effect between amphotericin B and fluconazole because available trial data analysed results in a way that disfavoured amphotericin B.

Trilaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, administered approximately thirty minutes before chemotherapy, has been shown in three clinical trials to significantly reduce the occurrence of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and the associated need for interventions such as the administration of G-CSF&#x27;s. The drug was approved in February 2021 by the FDA for use in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

In November 2023, FDA approved efbemalenograstim alfa.

==Prognosis==
If left untreated, people with fever and absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 have a mortality of up to 70% within 24 hours. The prognosis of neutropenia depends on the cause. Antibiotic agents have improved the prognosis for individuals with severe neutropenia. Neutropenic fever in individuals treated for cancer has a mortality of 4–30%.

==Epidemiology==

Neutropenia is usually detected shortly after birth, affecting 6% to 8% of all newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Out of the approximately 600,000 neonates annually treated in NICUs in the United States, 48,000 may be diagnosed as neutropenic. The incidence of neutropenia is greater in premature infants. Six to fifty-eight percent of preterm neonates are diagnosed with this auto-immune disease. The incidence of neutropenia correlates with decreasing birth weight. The disorder is seen up to 38% in infants that weigh less than 1000g, 13% in infants weighing less than 2500g, and 3% of term infants weighing more than 2500 g. Neutropenia is often temporary, affecting most newborns in only first few days after birth. In others, it becomes more severe and chronic indicating a deficiency in innate immunity.

Furthermore, the prevalence of chronic neutropenia in the general public is rare. In a study conducted in Denmark, over 370,000 people were assessed for the presence of neutropenia. Results published demonstrated only 1% of those evaluated were neutropenic, and were commonly seen in those with HIV, viral infections, acute leukemias, and myelodysplastic syndromes. The study concluded the presence of neutropenia is an ominous sign that warrants further investigation and follow-up.

<text>The Human Torch (Jonathan Lowell Spencer &quot;Johnny&quot; Storm) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is writer Stan Lee&#x27;s and artist Jack Kirby&#x27;s reinvention of a similar, previous character, the android Human Torch of the same name and powers who was created in 1939 by writer-artist Carl Burgos for Marvel Comics&#x27; predecessor company, Timely Comics.

Like the rest of the Fantastic Four, Johnny gained his powers on a spacecraft bombarded by cosmic rays. He can engulf his entire body in flames, fly, absorb fire harmlessly into his own body, and control any nearby fire by sheer force of will. &quot;Flame on!&quot;, which the Torch customarily shouts when activating his full-body flame effect, has become his catchphrase. The youngest of the group, he is brash and impetuous in comparison to his reticent, overprotective and compassionate older sister, Susan Storm, his sensible brother-in-law, Reed Richards, and the grumbling Ben Grimm. In the early 1960s, he starred in a series of solo adventures, published in &quot;Strange Tales&quot;. The Human Torch is also a friend and frequent ally of the superhero Spider-Man, who is approximately the same age.

In film, the Human Torch has been portrayed by Jay Underwood in the unreleased 1994 film &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;; Chris Evans in the 2005 film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, its 2007 sequel &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024); Michael B. Jordan in the 2015 film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;; and Joseph Quinn in the MCU films &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot; (2025), &quot;&quot; (2026), and &quot;&quot; (2027).

==Publication history==
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, Johnny Storm is a renovation of Carl Burgos&#x27;s original character, the android Human Torch, created for Timely Comics in 1939. Storm first appeared in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1 (cover-dated Nov. 1961), establishing him as a member of the titular superhero team. In his plot summary for this first issue, Lee passed on to Kirby that the recently formed Comics Code Authority had told him that the Human Torch was only permitted to burn objects, never people. Over the course of the series, Johnny being the little brother of teammate Susan Storm a.k.a. the Invisible Girl was one of several sources of tension within the group.

Additionally, he starred in a solo feature in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #101-134 (Oct. 1962 – July 1965). An eight-issue series, &quot;The Human Torch&quot; (Sept. 1974 – Nov. 1975), reprinted stories from that solo feature, along with stories featuring the original android Human Torch. Later years also saw a 12-issue series, &quot;Human Torch&quot; (June 2003 - June 2004) by writer Karl Kesel and penciler Skottie Young, and the five-issue team-up miniseries &quot;Spider-Man / Human Torch&quot; (March–July 2005) by writer Dan Slott and penciler Ty Templeton.

The Human Torch was the permanent co-star of &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, but was dropped after three issues because the creators found this format too restrictive. He co-starred in two one-shot comics, &quot;Spider-Man &amp; the Human Torch in... Bahia De Los Muertos!&quot; #1 (May 2009), by writer Tom Beland and artist Juan Doe, and &quot;Incredible Hulk &amp; the Human Torch: From the Marvel Vault&quot; #1, a previously unpublished story from 1984, intended for &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; by plotter Jack C. Harris, scriptwriter and artist Kesel, and breakdown artist Steve Ditko.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Growing up in Glenville, New York, a fictional Long Island suburban town, Johnny Storm lost his mother due to a car accident from which his father, surgeon Franklin Storm, escaped unharmed. Franklin Storm spiraled into alcoholism and financial ruin, and was imprisoned after killing a loan shark in self-defense. Johnny Storm was then raised by his older sister, Sue Storm.
At 16, Storm joined his sister and her fiancé, Reed Richards, in a space flight in which cosmic radiation transformed those three and spacecraft pilot Ben Grimm into superpowered beings who would become the celebrated superhero team the Fantastic Four. Storm, with the ability to become a flaming human with the power of flight and the ability to project fire, dubs himself the Human Torch, in tribute to the World War II-era hero known as the Human Torch. In &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #4, it is Storm who discovers an amnesiac hobo whom he helps regain his memory as the antihero Namor the Sub-Mariner, one of the three most popular heroes of Marvel Comics&#x27; 1940s forerunner, Timely Comics, returning him to modern continuity.

Though a member of a world-famous team, Storm still lived primarily in Glenville and attended Glenville High School. Here he thought he maintained a secret identity, although his fellow townsfolk were well aware of his being a member of the Fantastic Four and simply humored him. This series introduced what would become the recurring Fantastic Four foes the Wizard and Paste-Pot Pete, later known as the Trapster. In Storm&#x27;s home life, Mike Snow, a member of the high-school wrestling squad, bullied Storm until an accidental flare-up of the Torch&#x27;s powers scarred Snow&#x27;s face. Storm dated fellow student Dorrie Evans, although she eventually grew tired of his constant disappearances and broke off their relationship.

===College===
After graduating high school, Storm enrolled at New York City&#x27;s Metro College. There he befriended his roommate Wyatt Wingfoot. He also met the original Human Torch of the 1930s and 1940s. Around this time, Storm met and fell in love with Crystal, a member of the superpowered race the Inhumans. After their relationship ended, Crystal returned to her native city of Attilan and eventually married the superhero Quicksilver, Storm, crushed, attempted to move on, finding that his high-school girlfriend, Dorrie Evans, had married and had two children. Storm dropped out of college but remained friends with Wingfoot, who often participated in the Fantastic Four&#x27;s adventures.

Storm eventually began a romance with who he thought was Alicia Masters but was eventually revealed to be an alien from the shapeshifting Skrull race, Lyja, posing as Masters. In the interim, they married. Storm later discovers &quot;Alicia&#x27;s&quot; true identity, and that Lyja is pregnant with his child. He then witnessed Lyja&#x27;s apparent death and rescued the real Alicia from the Skrulls.

Storm briefly joined his nephew Franklin Richards&#x27; Fantastic Force team, where he battled his otherdimensional counterpart, Vangaard (formerly Gaard). Lyja posed as student Laura Green and dated Storm to stay close to him; Storm recognized her when they kissed, though he did not reveal this to her until later.

===Outside career and anti-registration movement===
Seeking an acting career, Storm was cast as the Old West hero the Rawhide Kid, but producers reconsidered and gave the role to Lon Zelig (actually the alien Super-Skrull). After working mostly in some television shows, Storm also spent some time as a firefighter at the behest of his former classmate, Mike Snow, but when Snow moved away after his wife turned out to be a psychopathic arsonist and seemingly died, Storm left the job. He later returned to the profession during a period when the Fantastic Four was short on cash. Frustrated with her brother&#x27;s directionless life and near-disastrous pranksterism, his sister compelled him to become chief financial officer for the Fantastic Four, Inc. Infighting and betrayal resulted in a near-catastrophe, ending Storm&#x27;s position.

After a major battle with the supervillain and dictator Doctor Doom, Fantastic Four leader Reed Richards attempted to claim Doom&#x27;s Latveria for the Fantastic Four, an act that alienated the United States government and his own team. This led to team-member Ben Grimm&#x27;s apparent death and the Fantastic Four&#x27;s subsequent dispersal. Storm took to fixing cars for a living. Grimm later was revealed to be alive. Over the Internet, Storm meets a young woman, Cole, whom he learns is the daughter of one of the Fantastic Four&#x27;s oldest enemies, the Wizard; after a confrontation with that supervillain, who escaped with Cole, Storm remained hopeful of meeting her again. For a time, Storm became the Herald of the powerful cosmic being Galactus, becoming the Invisible Boy after switching powers with his sister and teammate, Susan Richards, the Invisible Woman.

During the 2006–2007 &quot;Civil War&quot; company-wide crossover, in which the superpowered community is split over the Superhuman Registration Act, which required them to register with, and become agents of, the US government, Storm and his sister allied with the underground rebels, the Secret Avengers. Shortly afterward, during the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; company-wide crossover, the shape-shifting extraterrestrial Skrulls intensified their clandestine infiltration of Earth. Storm was briefly reunited with his former Skrull girlfriend, Lyja. Though part of the invading force, she finds she still has some feelings for him, and does not carry out her mission of sabotage. She returns to her people, unsure of herself and of any future relationship.

===Death and return===
In the conclusion of the 2011 &quot;Three&quot; storyline, in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #587 (March 2011), the Human Torch appears to die fighting a horde of aliens from the Negative Zone. The series ended with the following issue, #588, and relaunched in March 2011 as simply &quot;FF&quot;. Spider-Man, one of Storm&#x27;s friends, took his place on the team, as requested in the Torch&#x27;s will.

It is later revealed that the Human Torch was revived by a species of insect-like creatures that were implanted in his body by Annihilus in an attempt to force Storm to help open the Negative Zone portal. Storm eventually escapes and Richards determines Storm was on the other side of the portal for two years from his perspective.

The Human Torch becomes an ambassador within Inhuman society and joins Steve Rogers&#x27;s Avengers Unity Squad and helps Rogue in incinerating the telepathic portions of Professor Xavier&#x27;s brains, thus unknowingly preventing Hydra from using it for their secret empire. He becomes a multi-billionaire when he inherits Reed Richards&#x27; and Sue Storms&#x27; wealth and uses the money for rebuilding the Avengers Mansion and philanthropy. He is seemingly annihilated when he grabs a cosmic object called Pyramoids during the fight between the Lethal Legion and the Black Order in Peru, but is restored after Living Lightning wins a high stakes poker game versus Grandmaster.

To help the Thing cope with Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman&#x27;s disappearance, the Human Torch takes him on a journey through the Multiverse using the Multisect in order to find them. They have not been able to find Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman as they return to Earth-616 empty-handed. The Human Torch and the Thing were reunited with Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman to help alongside other superheroes who were part of the Fantastic Four (including surprisingly X-Men&#x27;s Iceman) fight the Griever at the End of All Things after Mister Fantastic persuaded the Griever to let him summon the Thing and the Human Torch. As the Thing and his teammates finally return to 616, while Future Foundation stays behind to keep learning multiverse, the Thing reveals to them that he proposed to Alicia and they are about to get married soon. Although the Baxter Building is now owned by a new superhero team Fantastix, the Thing allows his teammates to use his hometown Yancy Street as their current operation base. He later becomes engaged to an Unparalleled superhero named Sky from the planet Spyre, who then travels back to Earth with him and joins the Fantastic Four. Their relationship is brief however, when Johnny cheats on her with Victorious, a hero from Latveria and fiancé of Doctor Doom.

During a conflict at Doctor Doom&#x27;s wedding, where his infidelity with Victorious is revealed, Johnny Storm becomes permanently stuck in his Human Torch form and his powers are boosted to the point where it is unsafe for him to be around others.

During the &quot;Reckoning War&quot; storyline, Johnny unites various cosmic factions and leads their armies to defend the Watchers. Once the multiverse is saved, Johnny opts to return to Spyre with Sky so that her people can cure him and return him to normal.

==Powers and abilities==
Johnny Storm gained a number of superhuman powers as a result of the mutagenic effects of the cosmic radiation he was exposed to, all of which are related to fire. His primary ability is to envelop his body in fiery plasma without harm to himself, in which form he is able to fly by providing thrust behind himself with his own flame, and to generate powerful streams and balls of flame. He can also manipulate his flame in such a way as to shape it into rings and other forms, such as a fiery duplicate of himself that he can remotely control. Even when not engulfed in flame himself, Storm has the ability to control any fire within his immediate range of vision, causing it to increase or decrease in intensity or to move in a pattern directed by his thoughts. Additionally, he is able to absorb fire/plasma into his body with no detrimental effects.

The plasma field immediately surrounding his body is hot enough to vaporize projectiles that approach him, including bullets. He does not generally extend this flame-aura beyond a few inches from his skin, so as not to ignite nearby objects. Storm refers to his maximum flame output as his &quot;nova flame&quot;, which he can release omnidirectionally. Flame of any temperature lower than this cannot burn or harm the Torch. This &quot;nova&quot; effect can occur spontaneously when he absorbs an excessive amount of heat, although he can momentarily suppress the release when necessary, with considerable effort.

Storm has demonstrated enough control with fire that he can safely shave another&#x27;s hair, or hold a person while in his flame form without his passenger feeling discomforting heat. His knowledge extends to general information about fire as well, supported by regular visits to fire-safety lectures at various firehouses in New York. In one instance when poisoned, Storm superheated his blood to burn the toxin out.

Storm&#x27;s ability to ignite himself is limited by the quantity of oxygen in his environment, and his personal flame has been extinguished by sufficient quantities of water, flame retardant foam, and vacuum environments. He can reignite instantly once oxygen is returned, with no ill effects. In early stories he could only remain aflame for up to five minutes at a time, after which he would need five minutes to recharge before igniting himself again.

Storm was depicted as transmuting his body itself into living flame in the first two issues of &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;. In all subsequent appearances, his power consists in the generation of a flaming aura.

==Romance==
The Human Torch has been involved in several romantic relationships throughout the years, including, but not limited to, the Inhuman Crystal, member-in-training and future Galactus herald Frankie Raye, the Skrull agent Lyja disguised as Alicia Masters, the Atlantean Namorita, Inhuman Medusa, and X-Men member Rogue.

Crystal dissolved her relationship with him due to the adverse effects of pollution within population centers of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Frankie Raye ended her relationship with him when she accepted Galactus&#x27; offer to become his newest herald.

Lyja, while in the disguise of the Thing&#x27;s former girlfriend Alicia Masters, carried on a long-term relationship including marriage with the Torch, until it was revealed that her true nature was as a Skrull double agent. Although the two attempted reconciliation after it was learned that their &quot;child&quot; was actually an implanted weapon to be used against the Fantastic Four, they ultimately parted on less than favorable terms.

Torch&#x27;s brief relationship with Namorita lasted until he pursued a career in Hollywood. It is suggested that he had a short relationship with his Uncanny Avengers/Unity Squad leader Rogue, following which he had a rebound relationship with Medusa (Crystal&#x27;s sister). At first it seemed as if he and Rogue resumed their relationship, which was considered as an open secret, however this relationship came to an end after his apparent death and when Rogue rekindled her relationship with Gambit. He has also had relationships with civilian women.

In the Marvel Mangaverse comics, the Human Torch is portrayed by two separate characters spanning two very different continuities. The first character is a member of the Megascale Metatalent Response Team Fantastic Four on Earth-2301a and the mirror opposite of Earth-616&#x27;s Johnny Storm in terms of personality. The team uses power-packs to boost their talents to manifest at mecha-sized levels in order to combat Godzilla-sized monsters that seem to constantly attack Earth. In volume two of Mangaverse, which takes place on Earth-2301b, the character of Johnny Storm has been replaced with a young woman named Jonatha Storm, who is the half-sister of Sioux Storm. Jonatha is quite hotheaded; sometimes riding into battle singing &quot;I am the Goddess of Hellfire.&quot; She denies being impulsive, saying she can only be described that way in comparison to her &quot;neurotic&quot; teammates. In &quot;New Mangaverse&quot; Jonatha is slightly redesigned to look a few years younger than she did in volume one of Mangaverse, and no longer wears her hair in multiple braids, instead sporting two pigtails on each side of her head. After witnessing the murder of the other Fantastic 4 members by supernatural assassins, she joins Spider-Man, Spider-Woman (Mary Jane Watson), Black Cat, Wolverine, and Iron Man, in hopes of getting revenge.

===Marvel Zombies===
In this alternative universe crazed Reed Richards recently infects Johnny Storm, Sue Storm, and Ben Grimm with the zombie virus. The three then turn Reed into a zombie and the four of them go on a rampage with the other zombies. Eventually Reed contacts the Ultimate Reed and gets him to come to the infected universe. Johnny travels with the three others to the Ultimate Universe. They attack the Fantastic Four there but are thwarted, and are locked up in a containment cell. Johnny eats live animals and loathes the Ultimate version of himself, remarking that he especially hates his hair. When they escape the four attack the Baxter Building, Ultimate Reed switches bodies with Ultimate Doom and takes on all four zombies. Johnny is last seen being torn apart and extinguished by Reed in Dr. Doom&#x27;s body.

===MC2===
In the MC2 alternative future Johnny leads the Fantastic Five. He is married to Lyja and they have a son Torus Storm (who calls himself &quot;Super-Storm&quot; when role-playing as a hero). Torus has inherited both his father&#x27;s flame powers and his mother&#x27;s stretching / shapeshifting powers.

===Spider-Gwen===

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===
In the Amazing Spider-man comic&#x27;s event &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, Scarlet Spider (Kaine) and Spider-Man (Ben Reilly) met and fought Johnny Storm (Earth-802) who is the Head of Security of Baxter Building and serving one of the Inheritors, Jennix.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Johnny Storm is the youngest child of Franklin Storm, but is not as intelligent as his sister and father. He spent time at the Baxter Building, but his rebellious nature meant that he learned little from his time spent there. Although he is portrayed as being very vain, narcissistic, and displays some misogynistic tendencies, he is also shown to have a deep devotion to his friends and family. He is good friends with Spider-Man, and has a friendship/friendly rivalry with Bobby Drake due to each other&#x27;s respective powers.

He is present at Reed Richards&#x27; test of the N-Zone Teleportation Device in the Nevada Desert. After a malfunction in the device, he wakes up in France in a hospital bed. He uncontrollably bursts into flames until he learns to control his powers by saying &quot;Flame On&quot; and &quot;Flame Off.&quot;. When Mole Man&#x27;s creatures attacks, Johnny finds out he can fly while on fire. It is explained by Reed that Johnny&#x27;s combustion makes him lighter than air. Johnny&#x27;s body is covered with a microscopically thin film of transparent plates that make him impervious to flame. When he activates his powers, fat cells beneath his skin create clean nuclear fusion and jet out between the plates as plasma which then ignites on contact with air. Periodically, Johnny enters a hibernation where his old layer of skin peels off as ash while a new layer forms underneath. Unlike the mainstream Human Torch, Ultimate Johnny&#x27;s power sometimes have detrimental effects on his health, specifically causing unhealthy levels of weight loss and exhaustion.

In issues #68 and 69 of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, Johnny meets Spider-Man when his sister says he has to finish high school. Johnny picks a school in Queens which happens to be Midtown High. He quickly meets and becomes friends with Peter Parker, Mary Jane and Liz Allan. At a bonfire, he catches fire and scares off Liz Allan. He arranges to meet Liz, but she does not show up.

Encouraged by Mary Jane, Spider-Man shows up instead and gives Johnny a heart-to-heart talk about great power and great responsibility. Together, they save people from a burning building when Johnny absorbs the flames. Spider-Man shows Johnny that they will not always be appreciated by the public.

In issue #98 of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, the Fantastic Four learn Spider-Man&#x27;s identity, and Johnny recognizes Peter. In issue #101, Nick Fury and a regiment of Spider Slayers try to arrest Peter but are stopped by Johnny and the rest of the Fantastic Four.

In the &quot;Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends&quot; story arc (beginning with issue #118 and concluding in issue #120) Johnny returns to Midtown High wanting to spend time with real friends after becoming frustrated on a date with a popular pop-star who only came for publicity. After some prodding, Johnny arranges for a group consisting of himself, Peter, Mary Jane, Kitty Pryde, Kong, Bobby Drake and Liz Allan (Johnny&#x27;s apparent romantic interest) to have a somewhat normal day at the beach. During the evening bonfire, mirror his last visit, Liz Allan bursts into flame, exposing herself as a mutant. At the end of the arc, Liz returns to the Xaiver Institute with Iceman.

In Issue #129 of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, Johnny attends another unsuccessful date with the same pop-star as before and after again becoming frustrated calls Peter Parker to give him an excuse to leave. Johnny laments that he does not know any nice girls and has no real way of meeting any, and wants Peter to set him up. After flying off, he encounters The Vulture mid-robbery. Johnny attempts to stop him, but is thwarted several times before being assisted by Spider-Woman (a female clone of Peter Parker who is still mentally Peter up to the point of her &quot;birth&quot; in the Clone Saga story arc, a fact not disclosed to Johnny). Johnny proceeds to follow her around asking her for details about who she is, going as far to flirt with her. The very embarrassed Spider-Woman swings off.

Throughout the first story arc of &quot;Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man&quot; (the continuation of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;), Johnny Storm appears at Peter Parker&#x27;s door and passes out in his arms. When he wakes up he informs Aunt May that he does not wish to return to the Baxter Building. Aunt May decides to let him live with her, Peter and Gwen (later also adding Bobby Drake to the household as well). As to not raise suspicion and to not reveal Peters&#x27; secret identity, Aunt May comes up with the idea of coloring Johnny&#x27;s hair black and changing his name to Johnny Parker, Peter&#x27;s cousin. She then enrolls him and Bobby at Midtown High along with Peter and Gwen. The school is then attacked by a Spider-Slayer, created by Mysterio, to hunt down Spider-Man. Johnny runs away from the school before &quot;Flaming On&quot;, as to not reveal his new secret identity, then returns to aid Peter in the fight, only to discover that the Shroud has already taken care of it. Johnny decides to melt the remains of the Spider-Slayer anyway.

Later when Norman Osborn escapes alongside The Vulture, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, Doctor Octopus, and The Sandman, Johnny and Bobby find them at Peters home and Johnny manages to knock Osborn unconscious before sandman does the same to him. Spider-Man then wakes him up to fight Osborn again but Johnny only succeeds in adding to Osborn&#x27;s power before being knocked out yet again. Afterwards Spider-Man is killed after defeating Osborn and the other supervillains and Johnny is the one who checks to see if he truly is dead.

Ultimate Johnny appears briefly in issue one of &quot;Ultimate Fallout&quot;. In this issue, distressed by Peter&#x27;s death he screams and releases most of his energy above the city.

Johnny eventually joins Kitty Pryde&#x27;s team of mutants in the pages of Ultimate Comics: X-Men. He elects to stay behind and defend a group of younger mutants in the Morlock tunnels while Kitty, Iceman, Jimmy Hudson, and Rogue decide to head to the Southwest to fight off the Sentinels. He is later rescued wandering the streets of New York, having been severely tortured. The only clue to the fate of the children is a garbled phone call to Kitty by one of the children lamenting Johnny&#x27;s disappearance.

Johnny also makes an appearance in the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; video game, in which he challenges Spider-Man to a series of races.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker visited Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. One of the things he did was make sure that those who became the Fantastic Four didn&#x27;t fly into the cosmic storm. Maker&#x27;s memory log lists Johnny Storm as &quot;deceased&quot;. This was further elaborated in Doom&#x27;s flashback where they took the shuttle into outer space against Franklin Storm&#x27;s orders. Because of Maker&#x27;s sabotage, Johnny Storm burned to death and Susan Storm was dying from the radiation. Franklin later blamed an incarcerated Reed for killing his children when he used his connections to allow Reed to see Susan one last time.

===What If?===
In &quot;What If?&quot; vol. 2 #11 (March 1990), the origins of the Fantastic Four are retold, showing how the heroes lives would have changed if all four had gained the same powers as the individual members of the original Fantastic Four. In &quot;Pyros&quot;, all have the power of the Human Torch; after the team sets fire to what they believe to be an uninhabited area in order to battle a monster, they inadvertently kill the daughter of a woman squatting one of those buildings; the guilt causes them to disband, after which Reed Richards returns to his research, Storm becomes a race car driver and Grimm adopts the Human Torch moniker and joins the Avengers. Susan Storm, who could never forgive herself for the child&#x27;s death, took monastic vows and spent the rest of her life as a nun in penance. In &quot;Team Elastics&quot;, all have the power of Mister Fantastic, but Grimm, Sue Storm and Reed Richards all believe their powers to be silly; which also causes Sue Storm to leave Reed. Reed Richards returns to his research, only using his powers to aid him in his work, such as handling dangerous chemicals at far range, and Sue marries Ben Grimm, where they live a quiet domestic life free of superpowers. Johnny is the only member to go public, where he becomes a performer called &quot;Mr. Fabulous&quot;, using his powers to gain fame, fortune and women. In &quot;Monstrous&quot;, all become monsters, and relocate to Monster Isle. In &quot;The Phantoms&quot;, each gain one aspect of the invisibility power, with Johnny able to become intangible. The story focuses on the four becoming a special secret unit of S.H.I.E.L.D. which defends against an attack by, and ultimately captures and places in custody, Doom.

<text>John Isaac Guion (November 18, 1802 – June 6, 1855) was an American politician from Mississippi who served as Governor in 1851.

==Biography==
Guion was born in Adams County in the Mississippi Territory to Sarah Lewis and U.S. Army officer and planter Isaac Guion. He studied law in Lebanon, Tennessee, was admitted to the bar, and established a successful practice in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He practiced in partnership with William L. Sharkey and later with Seargent Smith Prentiss.

A Democrat in politics, Guion was first elected to the Mississippi State Senate in 1842. He later moved to Jackson, and continued to serve in the State Senate.

Guion supported slavery and states&#x27; rights. As a result, he played a prominent role in the Jackson convention of 1849, which was called to discuss how the Southern states should respond to the possibility of California being admitted to the union as a free state.

In 1850 Guion was chosen to serve as the Senate&#x27;s President pro tempore. In February 1851, Governor John A. Quitman resigned to defend himself against charges of aiding in filibustering expeditions against Spanish rule in Cuba. Guion became acting governor and served until November when his Senate term expired. He had not run for reelection, and the Speaker of the Mississippi House had also not. Since no one in the line of succession could assume the governorship, the legislature subsequently chose James Whitfield as an interim replacement, and he served until the term of the new governor started in 1852.

Guion had not run for reelection to the State Senate because he had run for the Mississippi District Circuit Court judge in Jackson. He began his term as scheduled and served until his death. He died on June 6, 1855, and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson.

<text>Northern Exposure is an American comedy-drama television series about the eccentric residents of a fictional small town in Alaska, that ran on CBS from July 12, 1990, to July 26, 1995, with a total of 110 episodes. It received 57 award nominations during its six-season run and won 27, including the 1992 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, two additional Primetime Emmy Awards, four Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and two Golden Globes.

In the show, Rob Morrow played New York City native Joel Fleischman, a recently graduated physician who is obligated to practice in Anchorage, Alaska, for several years to repay the state of Alaska for underwriting his medical education. Much to his chagrin, he is assigned to the much smaller and remote town of Cicely, which is in need of a general practitioner. Originally the show focused on Fleischman&#x27;s experiences in rural Alaska but as it progressed, it became more of an ensemble show, focusing on various other Cicely residents.

==History==
The series was created by Joshua Brand and John Falsey, who also created the award-winning shows &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;. It started as a mid-season replacement summer series on CBS in 1990 with eight episodes. It returned for seven more episodes in spring 1991, then became a regular part of the network&#x27;s schedule in 1991–92. It ranked among the top 10 viewed by 18- to 49-year-olds, and was part of the network&#x27;s 1992–93 and 1993–94 schedules.

In 1994, writer Sandy Veith won a jury trial against Universal, alleging that the series was based on his idea yet he received no credit or compensation. Veith won $10 million in damages and legal fees on appeal three years later. His suit was against the studio, not Brand and Falsey. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that jurors seemed to believe the studio came to Brand and Falsey with the basic concept for the show rather than that they knowingly stole Veith&#x27;s idea. Some Universal executives had worked with Veith and Brand and Falsey. Veith&#x27;s script was about an Italian-American doctor who moves to a small town in the South. In 1994, the same year that the lawsuit was filed, Brand and Falsey resigned. David Chase was brought in to serve as executive producer. He later went on to say that he took the job purely for the money, stating that he disliked the premise of the show; Brand cited Chase as having run the show into the ground.

In January 1995, the show moved from Monday to Wednesday, and in May 1995 there was a gap during sweeps when CBS broadcast other programming.
At one point, Barry Corbin wrote an open letter to TV critics that called the show &quot;an understandably weakened show&quot;. On May 24, 1995, CBS announced the cancelation of the show, which had its final episode shown on July 26. &quot;The show had a lot of life in it, and the move (Wednesday at 10pm) killed it,&quot; said executive producer Andrew Schneider. &quot;This piddling out is sad.&quot;

Morrow and his representatives spent much of seasons 4 and 5 lobbying for an improved contract, and intermittently threatened to leave the show. The producers responded by reducing Fleischman&#x27;s role in the storylines, and introducing characters such as Mike Monroe (season 4) and Dr. Phil Capra (season 6) to partially compensate for the absence of Morrow, whose last appearance came midway through the show&#x27;s final season.

==Cast and characters==


* Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow) is a neurotic young Jewish physician from New York City. Fresh out of family medicine residency, he is legally contracted to practice medicine for four years in Alaska according to the terms of a student loan underwritten by the state. Expecting to work in a relatively large, modern hospital in Anchorage, he is unexpectedly reassigned to be a general practitioner in the small town of Cicely, where he is a proverbial fish out of water. His struggles to adjust to the very unfamiliar environment drive the plot of many episodes, especially in the early seasons. Morrow left the show midway through its final season due to a contract dispute. His character&#x27;s departure was handled by having him &quot;go native&quot;, abandoning Cicely for a remote fishing village and embracing the wilderness in a search for spiritual enlightenment.
* Maurice Minnifield (Barry Corbin) is a multi-millionaire businessman, Korean War fighter pilot and astronaut who moved to the area after retiring from the military in the 1970s. Maurice owns Cicely&#x27;s newspaper and radio station, along with over of land which he hopes to develop into the &quot;Alaskan Riviera&quot;. It is Maurice who arranged to bring Joel to the town, which previously did not have a physician. Beneath a thin veneer of gentility, he is pompous, overbearing, and bigoted, leading to conflicts with other residents, such as the gay couple Ron and Eric. Despite his demeanor, Maurice can be generous, and he aids almost every other major character in some way during the show&#x27;s run. Before the timeline of the series, he had brought the much younger Shelly Tambo to Cicely with the intention of marrying her, but his best friend Holling Vincoeur won her heart.
* Maggie O&#x27;Connell (Janine Turner) is a tomboyish Grosse Pointe, Michigan-born debutante turned Alaska bush pilot. Maggie and Joel quickly develop a love-hate relationship, with their opposing views on most subjects coupled with unacknowledged attraction resulting in sexual tension in the early seasons. Later in the show&#x27;s run they become romantically involved and agree (briefly) to marry. It is their breakup that is the impetus for Joel to leave Cicely during the last season. A running theme through the series is that nearly all of Maggie&#x27;s romantic partners die in bizarre ways (one is struck by a falling satellite), leading others to wonder if she suffers from an &quot;O&#x27;Connell curse&quot;. Only two boyfriends escape this fate: Joel and Mike Monroe, who is hyperallergic to most things but, in a reversal of the curse, is cured.
* Holling Vincoeur (John Cullum) is the Canadian-born sexagenarian owner and operator of The Brick, a popular bar and restaurant, and mayor at the beginning of the show. He and Maurice are old friends, though their relationship was strained at one time by their shared romantic interest in Shelly Tambo, whom Holling married. Though over 40 years older than Shelly, he fears that he will outlive her, as the men in his family tend to live well past 100 and spend their final years as heartbroken widowers.
* Shelly Tambo (Cynthia Geary) is another Canadian expatriate and former Miss Northwest Passage, originally from Saskatoon. She was brought to Cicely by Maurice, who had hoped to marry her. Instead, she chose Holling and became a waitress at The Brick. Though seemingly naive and flighty, she regularly shows flashes of unexpected wisdom. It was planned for the character to be a Native American until Geary was cast.
* Chris Stevens (John Corbett) is a philosophical free spirit and ex-convict who works as the disc jockey at the radio station. Between songs, Chris comments on events in Cicely and on more intellectual and controversial subjects, often leading to conflict with Maurice, who fires and rehires him several times. The first of these conflicts comes when Chris reads Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; over the air and Maurice storms into the studio, decks Chris and fires him, not over the reading, but for suggesting that Whitman was gay. Chris is also a nondenominational clergyman and occasionally officiates at weddings.
* Ed Chigliak (Darren E. Burrows) is a mild-mannered, half-native Alaskan foundling raised by local Tlingits. Ed does odd jobs for Maurice and works part-time at the local general store. He is a film buff and aspiring movie director.
* Ruth-Anne Miller (Peg Phillips) is the elderly, level-headed owner of the local general store and a 30-year resident of Cicely. A widow, Ruth-Anne lives alone until late in the series, when she becomes involved with Walt Kupfer, a fur trapper and retired stockbroker. She too is a film buff and, along with Holling, a keen birder. She has two adult sons, one of whom is a stockbroker. He comes to see her in one episode.
* Marilyn Whirlwind (Elaine Miles) is Joel&#x27;s Alaska Native (Tlingit) receptionist. Her few words and exceptionally placid demeanor are a strong contrast to her employer&#x27;s loquaciousness and high-strung temperament.
* The Moose (Morty the Moose) rambles through the deserted town at the start of each episode while the opening credits appear.

In the show&#x27;s last season, two new characters were introduced to fill the void left by Morrow&#x27;s departure:
* Phil Capra (Paul Provenza), a doctor from Los Angeles who is recruited as Joel&#x27;s replacement after Joel takes to the wilderness.
* Michelle Schowdowski Capra (Teri Polo), Phil&#x27;s wife. She also works as a reporter for a newspaper owned by Maurice.

Major recurring characters include:
* Lester Haines (Apesanahkwat), a native millionaire
* Walt Kupfer (Moultrie Patten), an ex-Wall Street broker turned pelt hunter
* Mike Monroe (Anthony Edwards), an environmental activist with multiple chemical sensitivity
* Bernard Stevens (Richard Cummings Jr.), Chris&#x27;s African-American half-brother and &quot;spiritual doppelgänger&quot;
* Leonard (Graham Greene), a local shaman
* Officer Barbara Semanski (Diane Delano), Maurice&#x27;s love interest
* Erick Reese Hillman (Don McManus) and Ronald Arthur Bantz (Doug Ballard), a gay couple arrive and set up a business in Cicely. They eventually marry.
* Adam (Adam Arkin), a mysterious, obnoxious master chef
* Eve (Valerie Mahaffey), Adam&#x27;s hypochondriac and very wealthy wife. Mahaffey was the only actor from the series to win a Primetime Emmy Award.

==Production==
Cicely is widely thought to be based on Talkeetna, Alaska. Cicely is described throughout the series as being part of the &quot;Alaskan Riviera.&quot; In Season 6, Episode 15, Joel mails a post card to Maggie from Manhattan, and the zip code of Cicely is shown to be 99729, which is located north of Talkeetna and east of Denali National Park, and includes the town of Cantwell. However, most filming locations were in Roslyn, Washington. &quot;Northern Exposure II&quot; (the main production facility) was in Redmond, Washington, in what is now the headquarters of Genie Industries, behind a business park.

According to &quot;The Northern Exposure Book&quot;, the moose in the opening titles was named Mort and was provided by Washington State University, where he was part of a captive herd. To film the opening sequence, the crew fenced off Roslyn, set Mort loose, and lured him around with food.

==Episodes==

Notable episodes in the series include the pilot (nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Writing), the third season&#x27;s last episode, &quot;Cicely&quot; (which won a Peabody Award, three Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and a Directors Guild of America Award), and the fifth-season episode &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot;, which featured the second same-sex marriage story arc on U.S. prime-time television.

==Home media==
===DVD releases===
Universal Studios Home Entertainment has released all six seasons on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4. The Region 1 DVD releases have caused controversy among the show&#x27;s fans due to their high prices and the changes to the soundtrack introduced in order to lower their costs. The release of Season 1 contained the original music, but retailed for $60 due to the cost of music licensing. Subsequent seasons replaced most of the music with generic elevator-style music, resulting in a lower-cost release. The first and second seasons were also rereleased together in packaging that matches the third through sixth seasons. On July 21, 2020, &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; was rereleased by Shout! Factory, containing all 110 episodes but not with all original music. The Region 2 editions released in Germany on DVD contain all the original music.

===Blu-ray releases===
On March 19, 2018, Fabulous Films released the entire series on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom containing all original music.

===Streaming===
As of January 2024, all six seasons of the series are now available on Amazon Prime Video with the majority of its original soundtrack.

==Potential revival==
In 2016, Darren Burrows and his production company, Film Farms, held a crowdfunding campaign to fund a development project with the goal of creating more episodes. The working title for this project is &quot;Northern Exposure: Home Again&quot;. Despite not meeting the original $100,000 goal, Burrows decided to continue with the project.

On June 17, 2016, Film Farms announced that writer David Assael had been hired to write for the project. He previously wrote several episodes, including &quot;Russian Flu,&quot; &quot;Spring Break,&quot; and &quot;It Happened in Juneau,&quot; among others. The revival was originally envisioned as a two-hour &quot;visit to Cicely,&quot; but a ten-episode series was reportedly being pitched to various network, cable, and streaming venues.

On November 20, 2018, it was reported that a revival series was in the early stages of development at CBS, with Brand, Falsey, and Morrow executive producing and Morrow again playing Fleischman. Corbett was named as producer but his appearance as a performer was not confirmed. Falsey died in January 2019, and on May 19, 2019, Josef Adalian, an editor for the New York City-based magazine &quot;Vulture&quot;, tweeted that CBS had canceled development work on the series. Adalian subsequently tweeted that the rights holder, Universal Studios, could pitch the revival elsewhere, but it was unclear whether the studio was planning to move the project to another outlet. Morrow, who was busy with other commitments, found out about Falsey&#x27;s death on Twitter. On November 15, 2019, Morrow revealed in an interview on radio station WGN 720AM in Chicago that he and Brand were continuing revival efforts despite Falsey&#x27;s death and CBS&#x27;s decision.

<doc id="235432" wikidata="Q441838" url="?curid=235432" title="John A. Quitman">
<text>John Anthony Quitman (September 1, 1798 – July 17, 1858) was an American lawyer, politician, and soldier. As President of the Mississippi Senate, he served one month as Acting Governor of Mississippi (from December 3, 1835, to January 7, 1836) as a Whig. He was elected governor in 1849 as a Democrat, and served from January 10, 1850, until his resignation on February 3, 1851, shortly after his arrest for violating U.S. neutrality laws. He was strongly pro-slavery and a leading Fire-Eater.

According to Quitman&#x27;s first biographer, John F. H. Claiborne, writing in 1860, &quot;A more ambitious man never lived. ...He was greedy for military fame.&quot; &quot;For Quitman, military glory and political ambition had priority over management of his three plantations and numerous slaves.&quot;

==Early life==

Born at Rhinebeck, New York, in 1798, Quitman studied classics at Hartwick Seminary, graduating in 1816. He was an instructor at Mount Airy College, Pennsylvania, but decided to study law. Quitman&#x27;s family was of Dutch descent.

He was admitted to the bar in 1820 and moved to Chillicothe, Ohio. He moved south to Natchez, Mississippi the following year. He purchased Monmouth in 1826, and it would remain in his family for the next 100 years. It was an archaeological dig site investigated by Dr. Montroville Dickeson during his 10-year study of the Natchez Indians of the Mississippi River Valley.

==Plantation and enslaver==

Quitman owned four plantations: Springfield, which he purchased in 1834, on the Mississippi River near Natchez, a cotton plantation and dairy farm; Palmyra (Warren County, Mississippi), which he acquired through marriage (cotton); Live Oaks (Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, sugar and molasses); and Belen (Holmes County, Mississippi, cotton).

He did not personally manage the plantations, a task entrusted to (white) overseers. Not counting house servants, at Palmyra, he enslaved 311 people under sixty years of age in 1848; at Live Oaks, 85 in 1850; at Springfield, 39 in 1842; and at Belen, 32 in 1858.

One favored enslaved person accompanied him on his expedition to Mexico. Being frequently absent, Quitman was unaware of slave resistance and did not plan for slave revolts. &quot;Neither he nor his family entertained second thoughts about the propriety or morality of their holding blacks in bondage.&quot; He &quot;genuinely believed that owner-slave relations were harmonious. ...The Quitmans lived to the very eve of the Civil War virtually oblivious of the dangers of slave rebellion and believing, as Quitman put it, that Southern society was &#x27;based upon a more solid foundation&#x27; than Northern society.&quot;

==Politics==
In 1823 Quitman was the brigade inspector for the local militia and in the next year organized a volunteer militia company called the Natchez Fencibles. Quitman practiced law in Natchez until 1826 when he was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives. He became Chancellor of the state in 1828 and served on the state&#x27;s Constitutional Convention in 1832. He was the protégé of John C. Calhoun during the Nullification Crisis.

In 1835, he was elected to the State Senate, becoming President of the Senate the following year. He also served as Acting Governor of Mississippi. In 1838, he became a judge on the High Court of Errors and Appeal. Quitman was the grand master of the Mississippi Masons from 1826 to 1838 and again from 1840 to 1845.

He was initiated to the Scottish Rite Masonry till his elevation to the 33rd and highest degree.

==Mexican–American War==
The Natchez Fencibles were not selected to fight in the Mexican War due to a handful of men who failed to muster at Vicksburg at the proper time. However on July 1, 1846, during the Mexican–American War, Quitman was made a Brigadier General of Volunteers. He commanded a brigade under Zachary Taylor in northern Mexico.

After the Battle of Monterrey, he was sent to join Winfield Scott&#x27;s expedition. He led the 2nd Brigade in the Volunteer Division during the Siege of Veracruz, and on April 14, 1847, he was promoted to major general in the Regular Army.

Following the battle of Cerro Gordo, General Robert Patterson returned to the United States with other Volunteer soldiers whose enlistments had expired. Reinforcements from Veracruz, including about 300 U. S. Marines, were organized into a new brigade under Colonel Samuel E. Watson. Shields&#x27; and Watson&#x27;s brigades were designated the 4th Division, with Quitman in overall command.

By this point, Quitman had gained a reputation as a competent military commander and enjoyed affectionate respect from volunteer and professional soldiers alike.

Quitman led his division to the Valley of Mexico, where he was posted to guard the supply depot, hospital, and horse teams. Frustrated at his supporting role, Quitman was nevertheless ordered to send reinforcements to the front. At the battles of Contreras and Churubusco, Shields&#x27; brigade was actively engaged, though Quitman was not personally involved.

He commanded the southern assault during the battle of Chapultepec. U.S. Marines of Quitman&#x27;s division spearheaded the attack, and their involvement in this battle is remembered in the opening line of the Marines&#x27; Hymn. Quitman received the surrender of the citadel in Mexico City.

After the fall of Mexico City, General Scott named Quitman as the Military Governor of Mexico City for the remainder of the occupation. He was the only American to rule from within the National Palace of Mexico. Quitman was a founding member of the Aztec Club of 1847. He was discharged on July 20, 1848, and served as Governor of Mississippi in 1850 and 1851.

==Filibustering==

It was in his capacity as governor of Mississippi that Quitman was approached by the Venezuelan filibuster Narciso López to lead his expedition of 1850 to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule. He turned down the offer because of his desire to complete his term as governor but did offer assistance to López in obtaining men and materials for the expedition. López&#x27;s effort failed, and the repercussion led to Quitman&#x27;s being charged with violations of Neutrality Act of 1817 and his resignation from the post of the governor so that he could defend himself. The charges were dropped after three hung juries allowed him to avoid conviction.

With the encouragement of President Franklin Pierce, Quitman, with assistance from later Confederate General Mansfield Lovell, began preparations in July 1853 for a filibuster expedition of his own. The preparations to invade Cuba were nearly complete, with several thousand men prepared to go, when in May 1854, the administration reversed course and undertook steps to stop what it had almost put into motion, presumably because it felt that in the wake of the furor over the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, the action to add slave territory such as Cuba would cause irreparable damage to the Democratic Party in the North.

==Return to politics==
On March 4, 1855, Quitman was elected to the Thirty-fourth Congress for the Democratic Party and served in that and the ensuing Congress until his death. In Congress, he was Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs.

==Death==
John A. Quitman died at his home, &quot;Monmouth,&quot; near Natchez, Mississippi, on July 17, 1858, aged 59, apparently from the effects of National Hotel disease, which he contracted during the inauguration of President James Buchanan. He was buried in the Natchez City Cemetery in Natchez, Mississippi.

<text>The Xiph.Org Foundation is a nonprofit organization that produces free multimedia formats and software tools. It focuses on the Ogg family of formats, the most successful of which has been Vorbis, an open and freely licensed audio format and codec designed to compete with the patented WMA, MP3 and AAC. As of 2013, development work was focused on Daala, an open and patent-free video format and codec designed to compete with VP9 and the patented High Efficiency Video Coding.

In addition to its in-house development work, the foundation has also brought several already-existing but complementary free software projects under its aegis, most of which have a separate, active group of developers. These include Speex, an audio codec designed for speech, and FLAC, a lossless audio codec.

The Xiph.Org Foundation has criticized Microsoft and the RIAA for their lack of openness. They state that if companies like Microsoft had owned patents on the Internet, then other companies would have tried to compete, and &quot;The Net, as designed by warring corporate entities, would be a battleground of incompatible and expensive &#x27;standards&#x27; had it actually survived at all.&quot; They also criticize the RIAA for their support of projects such as the Secure Digital Music Initiative.

In 2008, the Free Software Foundation listed the Xiph.Org projects as High Priority Free Software Projects.

==History==
Chris Montgomery, creator of the Ogg container format, founded the Xiphophorus company and later the Xiph.Org Foundation. The first work that became the Ogg media projects started in 1994. The name &quot;Xiph&quot; abbreviates the original organizational name, &quot;Xiphophorus&quot;, named after the common swordtail fish, &quot;Xiphophorus hellerii&quot;. It was officially incorporated on 15 May 1996 as Xiphophorus, Inc. The name &quot;Xiphophorus company&quot; was used until 2002, when it was renamed to Xiph.Org Foundation.

In 1999, the Xiphophorus company defined itself on its website as &quot;a distributed group of Free and Open Source programmers working to protect the foundations of Internet multimedia from domination by self-serving corporate interests.&quot;

In 2002, the Xiph.Org Foundation defined itself on its website as &quot;a non-profit corporation dedicated to protecting the foundations of Internet multimedia from control by private interests.&quot;

In March 2003, the Xiph.Org Foundation was recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Organization, which means that U.S. citizens can deduct donations made to Xiph.Org from their taxes.

=== OpenCodecs ===
&quot;OpenCodecs&quot; is a software package for Windows adding DirectShow filters for the Theora and WebM codecs. It adds Theora and WebM support to Windows Media Player and enables HTML video in Internet Explorer. It consists of:
* &quot;dshow&quot;, Xiph&#x27;s DirectShow filters for their suite of Ogg formats, including Theora and Vorbis
* &quot;webmdshow&quot;, the DirectShow filter for WebM maintained by the WebM project
* An ActiveX plugin adding HTML video capability to Internet Explorer older than version 9

=== QuickTime Components ===
&quot;Xiph QuickTime Components&quot; are implementations of the Ogg container along with the Speex, Theora, FLAC and Vorbis codecs for QuickTime. It allows users to use Ogg files in any application that uses QuickTime for audio and video file support, such as iTunes and QuickTime Player.

Since QuickTime Components do not function in macOS Sierra and above, the project was discontinued in 2016.

<text>Pristigasteridae is a family of ray-finned fish related to the herrings, including the genera &quot;Ilisha&quot;, &quot;Pellona&quot;, and &quot;Pristigaster&quot;. One common name for the taxon is longfin herring. The taxonomic classification of this family is in doubt; it was traditionally divided into two subfamilies, Pelloninae and Pristigasterinae, but molecular data indicates that these are not monophyletic.

Pristigasteridae are mostly coastal and schooling fishes of tropical and subtropical seas. Their usual length is 20-25 cm, but some Pellona can reach 55 cm.

==Genera==
Pristigasteridae contains the following genera:

<text>Sardine and pilchard are common names for various species of small, oily forage fish in the herring suborder Clupeoidei. The term &#x27;sardine&#x27; was first used in English during the early 15th century; a somewhat dubious etymology says it comes from the Italian island of Sardinia, around which sardines were once supposedly abundant.

The terms &#x27;sardine&#x27; and &#x27;pilchard&#x27; are not precise, and what is meant depends on the region. The United Kingdom&#x27;s Sea Fish Industry Authority, for example, classifies sardines as young pilchards. One criterion suggests fish shorter in length than are sardines, and larger fish are pilchards.

The FAO/WHO Codex standard for canned sardines cites 21 species that may be classed as sardines. FishBase, a database of information about fish, calls at least six species pilchards, over a dozen just sardines, and many more with the two basic names qualified by various adjectives.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;sardine&#x27; first appeared in English in the 15th century, a loanword from French , derived from Latin , from Ancient Greek (&quot;sardínē&quot;) or (&quot;sardĩnos&quot;), possibly from the Greek (&quot;Sardō&quot;) &#x27;Sardinia&#x27;. Athenaios quotes a fragmentary passage from Aristotle mentioning the fish (&quot;sardĩnos&quot;), referring to the sardine or pilchard. However, Sardinia is over 1000 km from Athens, so it seems &quot;hardly probable that the Greeks would have obtained fish from so far as Sardinia at a time relatively so early as that of Aristotle.&quot;

The flesh of some sardines or pilchards is a reddish-brown colour similar to some varieties of red sardonyx or sardine stone; this word derives from (&quot;sardĩon&quot;) with a root meaning &#x27;red&#x27; and possibly cognate with Sardis, the capital of ancient Lydia (now western Turkey) where it was obtained. However, the name may refer to the reddish-pink colour of the gemstone sard (or carnelian) known to the ancients.

The phrase &quot;packed like sardines&quot; (in a tin) is recorded from 1911. The phrase &quot;packed up like sardines&quot; appears in &quot;The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction&quot; from 1841, and is a translation of &quot;encaissés comme des sardines&quot;, which appears in from 1829. Other early appearances of the idiom are &quot;packed together ... like sardines in a tin-box&quot; (1845), and &quot;packed ... like sardines in a can&quot; (1854).

==Genera==
Sardines occur in several genera.
*Genus &quot;Dussumieria&quot;
**Rainbow sardine (&quot;Dussumieria acuta&quot;)
**Slender rainbow sardine (&quot;Dussumieria elopsoides&quot;)
*Genus &quot;Escualosa&quot;
**Slender white sardine (&quot;Escualosa elongata&quot;)
**White sardine (&quot;Escualosa thoracata&quot;)
*Genus &quot;Sardina&quot;
**European pilchard (true sardine) (&quot;Sardina pilchardus&quot;)
*Genus &quot;Sardinella&quot;
**Goldstripe sardinella (&quot;Sardinella gibbosa&quot;)
**Indian oil sardine (&quot;Sardinella longiceps&quot;)
**Round sardinella (&quot;Sardinella aurita&quot;)
**Freshwater sardine (&quot;Sardinella tawilis&quot;)
**Marquesan sardinella (&quot;Sardinella marquesensis&quot;)
*Genus &quot;Sardinops&quot;
**South American pilchard (&quot;Sardinops sagax&quot;)

Although they are not true sardines, sprats are sometimes marketed as sardines. For example, the european sprat, &quot;Sprattus sprattus&quot;, is sometimes marketed as the &#x27;brisling sardine&#x27;.

==Species==

==Feeding==
Sardines feed almost exclusively on zooplankton, (lit. &quot;animal plankton&quot;), and congregate wherever this is abundant.

==Fisheries==

Typically, sardines are caught with encircling nets, particularly purse seines. Many modifications of encircling nets are used, including traps or fishing weirs. The latter are stationary enclosures composed of stakes into which schools of sardines are diverted as they swim along the coast. The fish are caught mainly at night, when they approach the surface to feed on plankton. After harvesting, the fish are submerged in brine while they are transported to shore.

Sardines are commercially fished for a variety of uses: for bait; for immediate consumption; for drying, salting, or smoking; and for reduction into fish meal or oil. The chief use of sardines is for human consumption, but fish meal is used as animal feed, while sardine oil has many uses, including the manufacture of paint, varnish, and linoleum.

==Food and nutrition==

Sardines are commonly consumed by humans as a source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and micronutrients. Sardines may be grilled, pickled, smoked, or preserved in cans.

Canned sardines are 67% water, 21% protein, 10% fat, and contain negligible carbohydrates (table). In a reference amount of , canned sardines supply 185 calories of food energy and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin B12 (375% DV), phosphorus (29% DV), and niacin (26% DV) (table). Sardines are a moderate source (10–19% DV) of the B vitamins, riboflavin and pantothenic acid, and several dietary minerals, including calcium and sodium (18% DV each) (table). A 100 g serving of canned sardines supplies about 7 g combined of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (USDA source in table).

Because they are low in the food chain, sardines are low in contaminants, such as mercury, relative to other fish commonly eaten by humans, and have a relatively low impact in production of greenhouse gases.

==History==

===History of sardine fishing in the UK===
Pilchard fishing and processing became a thriving industry in Cornwall, England from around 1750 to around 1880, after which it went into decline. Catches varied from year to year, and in 1871, the catch was 47,000 hogsheads, while in 1877, only 9,477 hogsheads. A hogshead contained 2,300 to 4,000 pilchards, and when filled with pressed pilchards, weighed 476 lbs. The pilchards were mostly exported to Roman Catholic countries such as Italy and Spain, where they are known as &quot;fermades&quot;. The chief market for the oil was Bristol, where it was used on machinery.

Since 1997, sardines from Cornwall have been sold as &#x27;Cornish sardines&#x27;, and since March 2010, under EU law, Cornish sardines have Protected Geographical Status. The industry has featured in numerous works of art, particularly by Stanhope Forbes and other Newlyn School artists.

The traditional &quot;Toast to Pilchards&quot; refers to the lucrative export of the fish to Catholic Europe:
:Here&#x27;s health to the Pope, may he live to repent
:And add just six months to the term of his Lent
:And tell all his vassals from Rome to the Poles,
:There&#x27;s nothing like pilchards for saving their souls!

===History of sardine fishing in the United States===
In the United States, the sardine canning industry peaked in the 1950s. Since then, the industry has been on the decline. The canneries in Monterey Bay, in what was known as Cannery Row in Monterey County, California (where John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel of the same name was set), failed in the mid-1950s. The last large sardine cannery in the United States, the Stinson Seafood plant in Prospect Harbor, Maine, closed its doors on 15 April 2010 after 135 years in operation.

In April 2015 the Pacific Fishery Management Council voted to direct NOAA Fisheries Service to halt the current commercial season in Oregon, Washington and California, because of a dramatic collapse in Pacific sardine stocks. The ban affected about 100 fishing boats with sardine permits, although far fewer were actively fishing at the time. The season normally would end 30 June. The ban was expected to last for more than a year, and was still in place .

==In popular culture==
The manner in which sardines can be packed in a can has led to the popular English language saying &quot;packed like sardines&quot;, which is used metaphorically to describe situations where people or objects are crowded closely together.

&#x27;Sardines&#x27; is also the name of a children&#x27;s game, where one person hides and each successive person who finds the hidden one packs into the same space until only one is left out, who becomes the next one to hide.

Among the residents of the Mediterranean city of Marseille, the local tendency to exaggerate is linked to a folk tale about a sardine that supposedly blocked the city&#x27;s port in the 18th century. It was actually blocked by a ship called the &quot;Sartine&quot;.

<doc id="235441" wikidata="Q1572414" url="?curid=235441" title="Kala namak">
<text>Kala namak or black salt is a kiln-fired rock salt with a sulphurous, pungent smell used in the Indian subcontinent. It is also known as &quot;Himalayan black salt&quot;, &quot;Sulemani namak&quot;, &quot;bit noon&quot;, &quot;bire noon&quot;, &quot;bit loona&quot;, &quot;bit lobon&quot;, &quot;kala loon&quot;, &quot;sanchal&quot;, &quot;kala meeth&quot;, &quot;guma loon&quot;, or &quot;pada loon&quot;, and is manufactured from the salts mined in the regions surrounding the Himalayas.

The condiment is composed largely of sodium chloride, with several other components lending the salt its color and smell. The smell is mainly due to its sulphur content. Because of the presence of greigite , Iron(II,III) sulphide) in the mineral, it forms brownish-pink to dark violet translucent crystals when whole. When ground into a powder, its color ranges from purple to pink.

Kala namak has been praised in Ayurveda and used for its perceived medical qualities.

==Production==
The raw material for producing kala namak was originally manufactured from natural halite from mines in Northern India in certain locations of the Himalayas, salt manufactured from the North Indian salt lakes of Sambhar or Didwana.

Traditionally, the salt was transformed from its relatively colorless raw natural forms into the dark-colored commercially sold kala namak through a reductive chemical process that transforms some of the naturally occurring sodium sulphate of the raw salt into pungent hydrogen sulphide and sodium sulphide. This involves firing the raw salts in a kiln or furnace for 24 hours while sealed in a ceramic jar with charcoal along with small quantities of harad seeds, amla, bahera, babul bark, or natron. The fired salt melts, the chemical reaction occurs, and the salt is then cooled, stored, and aged prior to sale. Kala namak is prepared in this manner in northern India with production concentrated in Hisar district, Haryana. The salt-crystals appear black and are usually ground to a fine powder that is purple.

Although kala namak may have traditionally been chemically produced from impure deposits of salt (sodium chloride) with the required chemicals (small quantities of sodium sulphate, sodium bisulphate, and ferric sulphate) and charcoal in a furnace it is now common to simply add the required chemicals to pure salt before firing. Reportedly, it is also possible to create similar products through reductive heat treatment of salt, 5-10% of sodium carbonate, sodium sulphate, and some sugar.

==Composition==
Kala namak consists primarily of sodium chloride and trace impurities of sodium sulphate, sodium bisulphate, sodium bisulphite, sodium sulphide, iron sulphide, and hydrogen sulphide.

Sodium chloride provides kala namak with its salty taste, iron sulphide provides its dark violet hue, and all the sulphur compounds give kala namak its slight savory taste as well as a highly-distinctive smell, with hydrogen sulphide being the most prominent contributor to the smell. The acidic bisulphates/bisulphites contribute a mildly sour taste. Although hydrogen sulphide is toxic in high concentrations, the amount present in kala namak used in food is small and thus its effects on health are negligible.

==Uses==

Kala namak is used extensively in South Asian cuisines of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal as a condiment or added to chaats, chutneys, salads, fruit, raitas, and many other savory snacks. Chaat masala, a South Asian spice blend, is dependent upon black salt for its characteristic sulphurous egg-like aroma. Those who are not accustomed to black salt may describe the smell as resembling flatulence. Black salt is sometimes used sparingly as a topping for fruits or snacks in North India and Pakistan. 

Kala namak is sometimes applied to tofu in vegan egg recipes. 

Kala namak is considered a cooling spice in Ayurveda and is used as a laxative and digestive aid. It is also been noted to relieve flatulence and heartburn. It is used in Jammu to cure goiters. This salt is also used to treat hysteria and for making toothpastes by combining it with other mineral and plant ingredients. The uses for goiter and hysteria are dubious. Goiter, due to dietary iodine deficiency, would not be remedied unless iodide was present in the natural salt. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration warned a manufacturer of dietary supplements, including one consisting of Himalayan salt, to discontinue marketing the products using unproven claims of health benefits.

<doc id="235450" wikidata="Q32498" url="?curid=235450" title="Nine Worthies">
<text>The Nine Worthies are nine historical, scriptural, and legendary men of distinction who personify the ideals of chivalry established in the Middle Ages, whose lives were deemed a valuable study for aspirants to chivalric status. All were commonly referred to as &#x27;Princes&#x27;, regardless of their historical titles. In French they are called &quot;Les Neuf Preux&quot; or &quot;Nine Valiants&quot;, giving a more specific idea of the moral virtues they exemplified: those of soldierly courage and generalship. In Italy they are known as &quot;i Nove Prodi&quot;.

The Nine Worthies include three pagans (Hector, Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar), three Jews (Joshua, David, and Judas Maccabeus), and three Christians (King Arthur, Charlemagne, and Godfrey of Bouillon).

==Origin==



They were first described in the early fourteenth century, by Jacques de Longuyon in his &quot;Voeux du Paon&quot; (1312). Their selection, as Johan Huizinga pointed out, betrays a close connection with the romance genre of chivalry. Neatly divided into a triad of triads, these men were considered to be paragons of chivalry within their particular traditions, whether Pagan, Jewish, or Christian. Longuyon&#x27;s choices soon became a common theme in the literature and art of the Middle Ages and earned a permanent place in the popular consciousness. The medieval &quot;craving for symmetry&quot; engendered female equivalents, the &quot;neuf preuses&quot;, who were sometimes added, though the women chosen varied. Eustache Deschamps selected &quot;a group of rather bizarre heroines&quot; selected from fiction and history, among them Penthesilea, Tomyris, Semiramis. Literature and suites of tapestry featured the full complement of eighteen, whose allegorical figures preceded King Henry VI of England in his triumphal royal entry to Paris, 1431. A &quot;tenth worthy&quot; was added by Deschamps, in the figure of Bertrand du Guesclin, the Breton knight to whom France owed recovery from the battles of Crécy (1346) and Poitiers (1356). Francis I of France still occasionally paraded himself at court dressed in the &quot;antique mode&quot; to identify himself also as one of the &quot;Neuf Preux&quot;.

The 1459 Ingeram Codex presents the coat of arms of the Nine Worthies among a larger list of attributed arms of exemplary individuals, as the three &quot;better Jews&quot;, &quot;best pagans&quot; and &quot;best Christians&quot; alongside the arms attributed to three heroes of King David (glossed as &quot;the first coats of arms&quot;), the Three Magi, the &quot;three mildest princes&quot;, the &quot;three worst tyrants&quot; (Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochos Epiphanes and Nero), &quot;three patient ones&quot; (Alphonse the Wise, Job and Saint Eustachius), &quot;three anointed kings&quot; (France, Denmark and Hungary) and &quot;three noble dynasties&quot; (Louis XI of France, called &quot;Louis the Prudent&quot; as Dauphin, Ladislaus I of Hungary, and Otto III, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg of the House of Welf).

==Classification==
The Nine Worthies comprise a triad of triads as follows:

===Pagans===
*Hector
*Alexander the Great
*Julius Caesar

===Jews===
*Joshua
*David
*Judah Maccabee

===Christians===
*King Arthur
*Charlemagne
*Godfrey of Bouillon

==Cultural references==

===Literature===
The Nine Worthies were also a popular subject for masques in Renaissance Europe. In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; the comic characters attempt to stage such a masque, but it descends into chaos. The list of Worthies actually named in the play include two not on the original list, Hercules and Pompey the Great. Alexander, Judah Maccabee, and Hector also appear on stage before the show collapses into complete disorder. The worthies are also mentioned in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; in which Doll Tearsheet is so impressed by Falstaff&#x27;s bravery in fighting Ancient Pistol that she says he is &quot;as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than the Nine Worthies&quot;.

Don Quixote evokes the Nine Worthies in Volume I, Chapter 5, telling a peasant (who is trying to get him to admit who he is) &quot;I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all together and each of them on his own account&quot;.

===Art===
The Nine Worthies had not devolved to folk culture even in the seventeenth century, for a frieze of the Nine Worthies, contemporary with Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy, was painted at the outset of the seventeenth century at North Mymms Place, Hertfordshire, an up-to-date house built by the Coningsby family, 1599.

The Cloisters, in New York City, has important portions of an early 15th-century tapestry series illustrating the surviving five of the Nine Worthies: King Arthur, Joshua, David, Hector, and Julius Caesar.

&quot;I Nove Prodi&quot;, a fresco by the &quot;Maestro del Castello della Manta&quot;, an anonymous master, painted c. 1420 in the &quot;sala baronale&quot; of the Castello della Manta, Saluzzo, Italy. The series also includes depictions of their female counterparts.

Montacute House has sculptures of the Nine Worthies spaced along the upper eastern façade on the exterior of the long gallery piers. These figures are dressed in Roman armour.

==Nine Worthy Women==
In the late fourteenth century, Lady Worthies began to accompany the Nine Worthies, though usually not individualized and shown as anonymous Amazon-styled warriors. In later years, nine of the &quot;Most Illustrious Ladies of All Ages and Nations&quot; were chosen from scripture, history and legend to be placed alongside their male counterparts, though the choices for the Lady Worthies were not usually standardized and often varied by region, author and artist.

Eustache Deschamps added &quot;neuf preuses&quot; (women) to the list of &quot;neuf preux&quot; , including Penthesilea, Tomyris, and Semiramis. Together with their male counterparts, they precede Henry VI as he enters Paris in 1431, and figure in &quot;Le Jouvencel&quot; (1466). The list of &quot;preuses&quot; was however less fixed, and not always structured in pagan, Jewish and Christian triads. Thomas III of Saluzzo has: &quot;Deiphille, Synoppe, Hippolyte, Menalyppe, Semiramis, Lampetho, Thamarys, Teuta, Penthésilée&quot;.

A very fine set of Siennese fifteenth century panel paintings, attributed to the Master of the Griselda Legend and others, now incomplete and widely dispersed, showed male and female worthies - the remaining paintings were reunited in a 2007 exhibition at the National Gallery, London.

In the German Renaissance, Hans Burgkmair made a set of six woodcuts, each showing three of the &quot;Eighteen Worthies&quot;. In addition to the usual males, his prints showed the Pagan Lucretia, Veturia and Virginia, the Jewish Esther, Judith and Yael, and the Christian Saints Helena, Bridget of Sweden and Elizabeth of Hungary. Burgkmair was in touch with Augsburg Renaissance Humanist circles, who may have helped choose the group. Apart from Veturia, mother of Coriolanus, who tried to save Rome from defeat by her son, the other pagan two were examples of chastity, responsible for no heroic acts except their defence of their own virtue. In contrast, two of the Jewish women, Judith and Jael, are known for their personal assassination of leaders opposed to Israel. Judith carries a sword in one hand and Holofernes&#x27;s severed head in the other, and Jael carries the mallet with which she hammered a peg in the head of Sisera. The &quot;Power of Women&quot; and female violence was an interest of German artists at the time, and Lucas van Leyden, Albrecht Altdorfer and others made prints of Jael in the act.

The Christian trio of saints, all very popular in Germany at the time, are all women who had been married - Bridget became an abbess as a widow. In addition, like three of the male worthies, Elizabeth of Hungary was an ancestor of Burgkmair&#x27;s patron Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and Helena was a Roman Empress. Unlike the other two groups, who all face each other, apparently in conversation, these three all look down, and may illustrate the female virtue of silence. Burgkmair&#x27;s conception was not very widely followed.

==&quot;Nine Worthies of London&quot;==
&quot;Nine Worthies of London&quot; is a book by Richard Johnson, written in 1592, which borrows the theme from the Nine Worthies. The book is subtitled &quot;Explaining the Honourable Excise of Armes, the Vertues of the Valiant, and the Memorable Attempts of Magnanimous Minds; Pleasaunt for Gentlemen, not unseemly for Magistrates, and most profitable for Prentises&quot;, celebrated the rise of nine famous Londoners through society from the ranks of apprentices or commoners.

The nine were Sir William Walworth, Sir Henry Pritchard, Sir Thomas White, Sir William Sevenoke, Sir John Hawkwood, Sir John Bonham, Christopher Croker, Sir Henry Maleverer of Cornhill, and Sir Hugh Calverley.

The term &quot;Nine Worthies&quot; was later used to refer to nine of the privy councillors of William III: Devonshire, Dorset, Monmouth, Edward Russell, Carmarthen, Pembroke, Nottingham, Marlborough, and Lowther.

<text>In mathematics, a random walk, sometimes known as a drunkard&#x27;s walk, is a stochastic process that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space.

An elementary example of a random walk is the random walk on the integer number line formula_1 which starts at 0, and at each step moves +1 or −1 with equal probability. Other examples include the path traced by a molecule as it travels in a liquid or a gas (see Brownian motion), the search path of a foraging animal, or the price of a fluctuating stock and the financial status of a gambler. Random walks have applications to engineering and many scientific fields including ecology, psychology, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and sociology. The term &quot;random walk&quot; was first introduced by Karl Pearson in 1905.

Realizations of random walks can be obtained by Monte Carlo simulation.

==Lattice random walk==

A popular random walk model is that of a random walk on a regular lattice, where at each step the location jumps to another site according to some probability distribution. In a &quot;simple random walk&quot;, the location can only jump to neighboring sites of the lattice, forming a lattice path. In a &quot;simple symmetric random walk&quot; on a locally finite lattice, the probabilities of the location jumping to each one of its immediate neighbors are the same. The best-studied example is the random walk on the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional integer lattice (sometimes called the hypercubic lattice) formula_2.

If the state space is limited to finite dimensions, the random walk model is called a &quot;simple bordered symmetric random walk&quot;, and the transition probabilities depend on the location of the state because on margin and corner states the movement is limited.

===One-dimensional random walk===
An elementary example of a random walk is the random walk on the integer number line, formula_3, which starts at 0 and at each step moves +1 or −1 with equal probability.

This walk can be illustrated as follows. A marker is placed at zero on the number line, and a fair coin is flipped. If it lands on heads, the marker is moved one unit to the right. If it lands on tails, the marker is moved one unit to the left. After five flips, the marker could now be on -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5. With five flips, three heads and two tails, in any order, it will land on 1. There are 10 ways of landing on 1 (by flipping three heads and two tails), 10 ways of landing on −1 (by flipping three tails and two heads), 5 ways of landing on 3 (by flipping four heads and one tail), 5 ways of landing on −3 (by flipping four tails and one head), 1 way of landing on 5 (by flipping five heads), and 1 way of landing on −5 (by flipping five tails). See the figure below for an illustration of the possible outcomes of 5 flips.


To define this walk formally, take independent random variables formula_4, where each variable is either 1 or −1, with a 50% probability for either value, and set formula_5 and formula_6 The series formula_7 is called the &quot;simple random walk on formula_3&quot;. This series (the sum of the sequence of −1s and 1s) gives the net distance walked, if each part of the walk is of length one.
The expectation formula_9 of formula_10 is zero. That is, the mean of all coin flips approaches zero as the number of flips increases. This follows by the finite additivity property of expectation:
formula_11

A similar calculation, using the independence of the random variables and the fact that formula_12, shows that:
formula_13

This hints that formula_14, the expected translation distance after &quot;n&quot; steps, should be of the order of In fact,
formula_15

To answer the question of how many times will a random walk cross a boundary line if permitted to continue walking forever, a simple random walk on formula_1 will cross every point an infinite number of times. This result has many names: the &quot;level-crossing phenomenon&quot;, &quot;recurrence&quot; or the &quot;gambler&#x27;s ruin&quot;. The reason for the last name is as follows: a gambler with a finite amount of money will eventually lose when playing &quot;a fair game&quot; against a bank with an infinite amount of money. The gambler&#x27;s money will perform a random walk, and it will reach zero at some point, and the game will be over.

If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are positive integers, then the expected number of steps until a one-dimensional simple random walk starting at 0 first hits &quot;b&quot; or −&quot;a&quot; is &quot;ab&quot;. The probability that this walk will hit &quot;b&quot; before −&quot;a&quot; is formula_17, which can be derived from the fact that simple random walk is a martingale. And these expectations and hitting probabilities can be computed in formula_18 in the general one-dimensional random walk Markov chain.
Some of the results mentioned above can be derived from properties of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. The number of different walks of &quot;n&quot; steps where each step is +1 or −1 is 2&quot;n&quot;. For the simple random walk, each of these walks is equally likely. 
In order for &quot;Sn&quot; to be equal to a number &quot;k&quot; it is necessary and sufficient that the number of +1 in the walk exceeds those of −1 by &quot;k&quot;. It follows +1 must appear (&quot;n&quot; + &quot;k&quot;)/2 times among &quot;n&quot; steps of a walk, hence the number of walks which satisfy formula_19 equals the number of ways of choosing (&quot;n&quot; + &quot;k&quot;)/2 elements from an &quot;n&quot; element set, denoted formula_20. For this to have meaning, it is necessary that &quot;n&quot; + &quot;k&quot; be an even number, which implies &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are either both even or both odd. Therefore, the probability that formula_19 is equal to formula_22. By representing entries of Pascal&#x27;s triangle in terms of factorials and using Stirling&#x27;s formula, one can obtain good estimates for these probabilities for large values of formula_23.

If space is confined to formula_1+ for brevity, the number of ways in which a random walk will land on any given number having five flips can be shown as {0,5,0,4,0,1}.

This relation with Pascal&#x27;s triangle is demonstrated for small values of &quot;n&quot;. At zero turns, the only possibility will be to remain at zero. However, at one turn, there is one chance of landing on −1 or one chance of landing on 1. At two turns, a marker at 1 could move to 2 or back to zero. A marker at −1, could move to −2 or back to zero. Therefore, there is one chance of landing on −2, two chances of landing on zero, and one chance of landing on 2.


The central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm describe important aspects of the behavior of simple random walks on formula_1. In particular, the former entails that as &quot;n&quot; increases, the probabilities (proportional to the numbers in each row) approach a normal distribution.

To be precise, knowing that formula_26,
and using Stirling&#x27;s formula one has

formula_27

Fixing the scaling formula_28, for formula_29 fixed, and using the expansion formula_30 when formula_31 vanishes, it follows

formula_32

taking the limit (and observing that formula_33 corresponds to the spacing of the scaling grid) one finds the gaussian density formula_34. Indeed, for a absolutely continuous random variable formula_35 with density formula_36 it holds formula_37, with formula_38 corresponding to an infinitesimal spacing.

As a direct generalization, one can consider random walks on crystal lattices (infinite-fold abelian covering graphs over finite graphs). Actually it is possible to establish the central limit theorem and large deviation theorem in this setting.

====As a Markov chain====
A one-dimensional &quot;random walk&quot; can also be looked at as a Markov chain whose state space is given by the integers formula_39 For some number &quot;p&quot; satisfying formula_40, the transition probabilities (the probability &quot;Pi,j&quot; of moving from state &quot;i&quot; to state &quot;j&quot;) are given by
formula_41

==== Heterogeneous generalization ====

The heterogeneous random walk draws in each time step a random number that determines the local jumping probabilities and then a random number that determines the actual jump direction. The main question is the probability of staying in each of the various sites after formula_42 jumps, and in the limit of this probability when formula_42 is very large.

===Higher dimensions===

In higher dimensions, the set of randomly walked points has interesting geometric properties. In fact, one gets a discrete fractal, that is, a set which exhibits stochastic self-similarity on large scales. On small scales, one can observe &quot;jaggedness&quot; resulting from the grid on which the walk is performed. The trajectory of a random walk is the collection of points visited, considered as a set with disregard to &quot;when&quot; the walk arrived at the point. In one dimension, the trajectory is simply all points between the minimum height and the maximum height the walk achieved (both are, on average, on the order of formula_44).

To visualize the two-dimensional case, one can imagine a person walking randomly around a city. The city is effectively infinite and arranged in a square grid of sidewalks. At every intersection, the person randomly chooses one of the four possible routes (including the one originally travelled from). Formally, this is a random walk on the set of all points in the plane with integer coordinates.

To answer the question of the person ever getting back to the original starting point of the walk, this is the 2-dimensional equivalent of the level-crossing problem discussed above. In 1921 George Pólya proved that the person almost surely would in a 2-dimensional random walk, but for 3 dimensions or higher, the probability of returning to the origin decreases as the number of dimensions increases. In 3 dimensions, the probability decreases to roughly 34%. The mathematician Shizuo Kakutani was known to refer to this result with the following quote: &quot;A drunk man will find his way home, but a drunk bird may get lost forever&quot;.

The probability of recurrence is in general formula_45, which can be derived by generating functions or Poisson process.

Another variation of this question which was also asked by Pólya is: &quot;if two people leave the same starting point, then will they ever meet again?&quot; It can be shown that the difference between their locations (two independent random walks) is also a simple random walk, so they almost surely meet again in a 2-dimensional walk, but for 3 dimensions and higher the probability decreases with the number of the dimensions. Paul Erdős and Samuel James Taylor also showed in 1960 that for dimensions less or equal than 4, two independent random walks starting from any two given points have infinitely many intersections almost surely, but for dimensions higher than 5, they almost surely intersect only finitely often.

The asymptotic function for a two-dimensional random walk as the number of steps increases is given by a Rayleigh distribution. The probability distribution is a function of the radius from the origin and the step length is constant for each step. Here, the step length is assumed to be 1, N is the total number of steps and r is the radius from the origin.

===Relation to Wiener process===

A Wiener process is a stochastic process with similar behavior to Brownian motion, the physical phenomenon of a minute particle diffusing in a fluid. (Sometimes the Wiener process is called &quot;Brownian motion&quot;, although this is strictly speaking a confusion of a model with the phenomenon being modeled.)

A Wiener process is the scaling limit of random walk in dimension 1. This means that if there is a random walk with very small steps, there is an approximation to a Wiener process (and, less accurately, to Brownian motion). To be more precise, if the step size is ε, one needs to take a walk of length &quot;L&quot;/ε2 to approximate a Wiener length of &quot;L&quot;. As the step size tends to 0 (and the number of steps increases proportionally), random walk converges to a Wiener process in an appropriate sense. Formally, if &quot;B&quot; is the space of all paths of length &quot;L&quot; with the maximum topology, and if &quot;M&quot; is the space of measure over &quot;B&quot; with the norm topology, then the convergence is in the space &quot;M&quot;. Similarly, a Wiener process in several dimensions is the scaling limit of random walk in the same number of dimensions.

A random walk is a discrete fractal (a function with integer dimensions; 1, 2, ...), but a Wiener process trajectory is a true fractal, and there is a connection between the two. For example, take a random walk until it hits a circle of radius &quot;r&quot; times the step length. The average number of steps it performs is &quot;r&quot;2. This fact is the &quot;discrete version&quot; of the fact that a Wiener process walk is a fractal of Hausdorff dimension 2.

In two dimensions, the average number of points the same random walk has on the &quot;boundary&quot; of its trajectory is &quot;r&quot;4/3. This corresponds to the fact that the boundary of the trajectory of a Wiener process is a fractal of dimension 4/3, a fact predicted by Mandelbrot using simulations but proved only in 2000
by Lawler, Schramm and Werner.

A Wiener process enjoys many symmetries a random walk does not. For example, a Wiener process walk is invariant to rotations, but the random walk is not, since the underlying grid is not (random walk is invariant to rotations by 90 degrees, but Wiener processes are invariant to rotations by, for example, 17 degrees too). This means that in many cases, problems on a random walk are easier to solve by translating them to a Wiener process, solving the problem there, and then translating back. On the other hand, some problems are easier to solve with random walks due to its discrete nature.

Random walk and Wiener process can be &quot;coupled&quot;, namely manifested on the same probability space in a dependent way that forces them to be quite close. The simplest such coupling is the Skorokhod embedding, but there exist more precise couplings, such as Komlós–Major–Tusnády approximation theorem.

The convergence of a random walk toward the Wiener process is controlled by the central limit theorem, and by Donsker&#x27;s theorem. For a particle in a known fixed position at &quot;t&quot; = 0, the central limit theorem tells us that after a large number of independent steps in the random walk, the walker&#x27;s position is distributed according to a normal distribution of total variance:

formula_47

where &quot;t&quot; is the time elapsed since the start of the random walk, formula_48 is the size of a step of the random walk, and formula_49 is the time elapsed between two successive steps.

This corresponds to the Green&#x27;s function of the diffusion equation that controls the Wiener process, which suggests that, after a large number of steps, the random walk converges toward a Wiener process.

In 3D, the variance corresponding to the Green&#x27;s function of the diffusion equation is:
formula_50

By equalizing this quantity with the variance associated to the position of the random walker, one obtains the equivalent diffusion coefficient to be considered for the asymptotic Wiener process toward which the random walk converges after a large number of steps:
formula_51 (valid only in 3D).

The two expressions of the variance above correspond to the distribution associated to the vector formula_52 that links the two ends of the random walk, in 3D. The variance associated to each component formula_53, formula_54 or formula_55 is only one third of this value (still in 3D).

For 2D:

formula_56

For 1D:

formula_57

==Gaussian random walk==
A random walk having a step size that varies according to a normal distribution is used as a model for real-world time series data such as financial markets.

Here, the step size is the inverse cumulative normal distribution formula_58 where 0 ≤ &quot;z&quot; ≤ 1 is a uniformly distributed random number, and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviations of the normal distribution, respectively.

If μ is nonzero, the random walk will vary about a linear trend. If vs is the starting value of the random walk, the expected value after &quot;n&quot; steps will be vs + &quot;n&quot;μ.

For the special case where μ is equal to zero, after &quot;n&quot; steps, the translation distance&#x27;s probability distribution is given by &quot;N&quot;(0, &quot;n&quot;σ2), where &quot;N&quot;() is the notation for the normal distribution, &quot;n&quot; is the number of steps, and σ is from the inverse cumulative normal distribution as given above.

Proof: The Gaussian random walk can be thought of as the sum of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, Xi from the inverse cumulative normal distribution with mean equal zero and σ of the original inverse cumulative normal distribution:
:formula_59

but we have the distribution for the sum of two independent normally distributed random variables, , is given by 
formula_60 (see here).

In our case, and yield
formula_61
By induction, for &quot;n&quot; steps we have
formula_62
For steps distributed according to any distribution with zero mean and a finite variance (not necessarily just a normal distribution), the root mean square translation distance after &quot;n&quot; steps is (see Bienaymé&#x27;s identity)
:formula_63

But for the Gaussian random walk, this is just the standard deviation of the translation distance&#x27;s distribution after &quot;n&quot; steps. Hence, if μ is equal to zero, and since the root mean square(RMS) translation distance is one standard deviation, there is 68.27% probability that the RMS translation distance after &quot;n&quot; steps will fall between formula_64. Likewise, there is 50% probability that the translation distance after &quot;n&quot; steps will fall between formula_65.

===Number of distinct sites===
The number of distinct sites visited by a single random walker formula_66 has been studied extensively for square and cubic lattices and for fractals. This quantity is useful for the analysis of problems of trapping and kinetic reactions. It is also related to the vibrational density of states, diffusion reactions processes
and spread of populations in ecology.

===Information rate===
The information rate of a Gaussian random walk with respect to the squared error distance, i.e. its quadratic rate distortion function, is given parametrically by
formula_67
formula_68
where formula_69. Therefore, it is impossible to encode formula_70 using a binary code of less than formula_71 bits and recover it with expected mean squared error less than formula_72. On the other hand, for any formula_73, there exists an formula_74 large enough and a binary code of no more than formula_75 distinct elements such that the expected mean squared error in recovering formula_70 from this code is at most formula_77.

==Applications==
As mentioned, the range of natural phenomena which have been subject to attempts at description by some flavour of random walks is considerable. This is particularly the case in the fields of physics,chemistry, materials science, and biology. 

The following are some specific applications of random walks:
*In financial economics, the random walk hypothesis is used to model shares prices and other factors. Empirical studies found some deviations from this theoretical model, especially in short term and long term correlations. See share prices.
*In population genetics, random walk describes the statistical properties of genetic drift or long-term randomly fluctuating selection.
*In physics, random walks are used as simplified models of physical Brownian motion and diffusion such as the random movement of molecules in liquids and gases. See for example diffusion-limited aggregation. Also in physics, random walks and some of the self interacting walks play a role in quantum field theory.
*In semiconductor manufacturing, random walks are used to analyze the effects of thermal treatment at smaller nodes. It is applied to understand the diffusion of dopants, defects, impurities etc., during critical fabrication steps. Random walk treatments are also used to study the diffusion of reactants, products and plasma during chemical vapor deposition processes. Continuum diffusion has been used to study the flow of gases, at macroscopic scales, in CVD reactors. However, smaller dimensions and increased complexity has forced us to treat them with random walk. This allows for accurate analysis of stochastic processes, at molecular level and smaller, in semiconductor manufacturing.
*In mathematical ecology, random walks are used to describe individual animal movements, to empirically support processes of biodiffusion, and occasionally to model population dynamics.
*In polymer physics, random walk describes an ideal chain. It is the simplest model to study polymers.
*In other fields of mathematics, random walk is used to calculate solutions to Laplace&#x27;s equation, to estimate the harmonic measure, and for various constructions in analysis and combinatorics.
* In computer science, random walks are used to estimate the size of the Web.
* In image segmentation, random walks are used to determine the labels (i.e., &quot;object&quot; or &quot;background&quot;) to associate with each pixel. This algorithm is typically referred to as the random walker segmentation algorithm.
*In brain research, random walks and reinforced random walks are used to model cascades of neuron firing in the brain.
*In vision science, ocular drift tends to behave like a random walk. According to some authors, fixational eye movements in general are also well described by a random walk.
*In psychology, random walks explain accurately the relation between the time needed to make a decision and the probability that a certain decision will be made.
*Random walks can be used to sample from a state space which is unknown or very large, for example to pick a random page off the internet. In computer science, this method is known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
*In wireless networking, a random walk is used to model node movement.
*Motile bacteria engage in biased random walks.
*In physics, random walks underlie the method of Fermi estimation.
*On the web, the Twitter website uses random walks to make suggestions of whom to follow
*Dave Bayer and Persi Diaconis have proven that 7 riffle shuffles are sufficient to mix a deck of cards (see more details under shuffle). This result translates to a statement about random walk on the symmetric group which is what they prove, with a crucial use of the group structure via Fourier analysis.

==Variants==

A number of types of stochastic processes have been considered that are similar to the pure random walks but where the simple structure is allowed to be more generalized. The &quot;pure&quot; structure can be characterized by the steps being defined by independent and identically distributed random variables. Random walks can take place on a variety of spaces, such as graphs, the integers, the real line, the plane or higher-dimensional vector spaces, on curved surfaces or higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and on groups. It is also possible to define random walks which take their steps at random times, and in that case, the position has to be defined for all times . Specific cases or limits of random walks include the Lévy flight and diffusion models such as Brownian motion.

===On graphs===

A random walk of length &quot;k&quot; on a possibly infinite graph &quot;G&quot; with a root &quot;0&quot; is a stochastic process with random variables formula_78 such that formula_79 and
formula_80 is a vertex chosen uniformly at random from the neighbors of formula_81.
Then the number formula_82 is the probability that a random walk of length &quot;k&quot; starting at &quot;v&quot; ends at &quot;w&quot;.
In particular, if &quot;G&quot; is a graph with root &quot;0&quot;, formula_83 is the probability that a formula_84-step random walk returns to &quot;0&quot;.

Building on the analogy from the earlier section on higher dimensions, assume now that our city is no longer a perfect square grid. When our person reaches a certain junction, he picks between the variously available roads with equal probability. Thus, if the junction has seven exits the person will go to each one with probability one-seventh. This is a random walk on a graph. Will our person reach his home? It turns out that under rather mild conditions, the answer is still yes, but depending on the graph, the answer to the variant question &#x27;Will two persons meet again?&#x27; may not be that they meet infinitely often almost surely.

An example of a case where the person will reach his home almost surely is when the lengths of all the blocks are between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; (where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are any two finite positive numbers). Notice that we do not assume that the graph is planar, i.e. the city may contain tunnels and bridges. One way to prove this result is using the connection to electrical networks. Take a map of the city and place a one ohm resistor on every block. Now measure the &quot;resistance between a point and infinity&quot;. In other words, choose some number &quot;R&quot; and take all the points in the electrical network with distance bigger than &quot;R&quot; from our point and wire them together. This is now a finite electrical network, and we may measure the resistance from our point to the wired points. Take &quot;R&quot; to infinity. The limit is called the &quot;resistance between a point and infinity&quot;. It turns out that the following is true (an elementary proof can be found in the book by Doyle and Snell):

Theorem: &quot;a graph is transient if and only if the resistance between a point and infinity is finite. It is not important which point is chosen if the graph is connected.&quot;

In other words, in a transient system, one only needs to overcome a finite resistance to get to infinity from any point. In a recurrent system, the resistance from any point to infinity is infinite.

This characterization of transience and recurrence is very useful, and specifically it allows us to analyze the case of a city drawn in the plane with the distances bounded.

A random walk on a graph is a very special case of a Markov chain. Unlike a general Markov chain, random walk on a graph enjoys a property called &quot;time symmetry&quot; or &quot;reversibility&quot;. Roughly speaking, this property, also called the principle of detailed balance, means that the probabilities to traverse a given path in one direction or the other have a very simple connection between them (if the graph is regular, they are just equal). This property has important consequences.

Starting in the 1980s, much research has gone into connecting properties of the graph to random walks. In addition to the electrical network connection described above, there are important connections to isoperimetric inequalities, see more here, functional inequalities such as Sobolev and Poincaré inequalities and properties of solutions of Laplace&#x27;s equation. A significant portion of this research was focused on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups. In many cases these discrete results carry over to, or are derived from manifolds and Lie groups.

In the context of random graphs, particularly that of the Erdős–Rényi model, analytical results to some properties of random walkers have been obtained. These include the distribution of first and last hitting times of the walker, where the first hitting time is given by the first time the walker steps into a previously visited site of the graph, and the last hitting time corresponds the first time the walker cannot perform an additional move without revisiting a previously visited site.

A good reference for random walk on graphs is the online book by Aldous and Fill. For groups see the book of Woess.
If the transition kernel formula_85 is itself random (based on an environment formula_86) then the random walk is called a &quot;random walk in random environment&quot;. When the law of the random walk includes the randomness of formula_86, the law is called the annealed law; on the other hand, if formula_86 is seen as fixed, the law is called a quenched law. See the book of Hughes, the book of Revesz, or the lecture notes of Zeitouni.

We can think about choosing every possible edge with the same probability as maximizing uncertainty (entropy) locally. We could also do it globally – in maximal entropy random walk (MERW) we want all paths to be equally probable, or in other words: for every two vertexes, each path of given length is equally probable. This random walk has much stronger localization properties.

===Self-interacting random walks===
There are a number of interesting models of random paths in which each step depends on the past in a complicated manner. All are more complex for solving analytically than the usual random walk; still, the behavior of any model of a random walker is obtainable using computers. Examples include:
* The self-avoiding walk.
The self-avoiding walk of length &quot;n&quot; on formula_89 is the random &quot;n&quot;-step path which starts at the origin, makes transitions only between adjacent sites in formula_89, never revisit a site, and is chosen uniformly among all such paths. In two dimensions, due to self-trapping, a typical self-avoiding walk is very short, while in higher dimension it grows beyond all bounds.
This model has often been used in polymer physics (since the 1960s).
* The loop-erased random walk.
* The reinforced random walk.
* The exploration process.
* The multiagent random walk.
===Biased random walks on graphs===
=== Maximal entropy random walk ===

Random walk chosen to maximize entropy rate, has much stronger localization properties.

===Correlated random walks===

Random walks where the direction of movement at one time is correlated with the direction of movement at the next time. It is used to model animal movements.

<doc id="235455" wikidata="Q2914544" url="?curid=235455" title="Duchy of Lancaster">
<text>The Duchy of Lancaster is an estate of the British sovereign. The estate has its origins in the lands held by the medieval Dukes of Lancaster, which came under the direct control of the monarch when Henry Bolingbroke, the then duke of Lancaster, ascended the throne in 1399. In 1461 King Edward IV confirmed that the Duchy would be inherited by the monarch, but held separately from the Crown Estate, the other assets which belong to the monarch.

The Duchy consists of a portfolio of lands, properties, and assets held in trust for the sovereign. The principal purpose of the estate is to provide a source of independent income. The Duchy consists of of land holdings, including rural estates and farmland, urban developments, historic buildings, and commercial properties across England and Wales, particularly in Cheshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and the Savoy Estate in London. As of the financial year ending 31 March 2022, the estate was valued at £652.8 million. The net income of the duchy is paid to the reigning sovereign and amounts to about £24 million per year.

The Duchy exercises some powers and ceremonial duties of the Crown in the historic county of Lancashire, which includes the current ceremonial counties of Lancashire, Greater Manchester, and Merseyside, as well as the Furness area of Cumbria. The Duchy of Lancaster is one of two royal duchies: the other is the Duchy of Cornwall, which provides income to the Duke of Cornwall, a title which is held by the monarch&#x27;s oldest son.

==History==
As the Lancaster inheritance, the estate dates to 1265, when Henry III granted his younger son, Edmund Crouchback, lands forfeited by Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. In 1266, the estates of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby, another protagonist in the Second Barons&#x27; War, were added. In 1267 the estate was granted as the county, Honour and Castle of Lancaster. In 1284 Edmund was given the Manor of Savoy near London by his mother, Eleanor of Provence, the niece of the original grantee, Peter II, Count of Savoy. Edward III raised Lancashire into a county palatine in 1351, and the holder, Henry of Grosmont, Edmund&#x27;s grandson, was created Duke of Lancaster. After his death a charter of 1362 conferred the dukedom on his son-in-law John of Gaunt, Earl of Lancaster, and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten forever.

In 1399 the Duchy of Lancaster, held by John of Gaunt&#x27;s son Henry of Bolingbroke, merged with the crown on his appropriation of the throne (after the dispossession from Richard II). His first act as Henry IV was to declare that the Lancastrian inheritance be held separately from the other possessions of the Crown and should descend to male heirs. This separation of identities was confirmed in 1461 by Edward IV when he incorporated the inheritance and the palatinate responsibilities under the title of the Duchy of Lancaster, and stipulated that it be held separate from other inheritances by him and his heirs, but would however be inherited with the Crown, to which it was forfeited on the attainder of Henry VI. The duchy thereafter passed to the reigning monarch. On the death of King Charles I, the duchy came under the control of Parliament; this lasted until the restoration of King Charles II in 1660. In 1760, its separate identity preserved it from being surrendered with the Crown Estates in exchange for the civil list. It is primarily a landed inheritance belonging to the reigning sovereign (now Charles III). When George III surrendered his income from Crown lands in exchange for the Civil List, the Duchy of Lancaster was not mentioned at all as it was bankrupt for most of the century, due to previous monarchs selling its assets or granting leases for political favours. The monarch now does not have the right to sell off the capital assets for personal gain.

In 1830, the Whigs argued that revenues from the two duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall should go to the public, but to secure King William IV&#x27;s support for the Reform Act 1832 they eventually approved the civil list and left the duchies in possession of the royal family. Parliament debated the two duchies&#x27; ownership multiple times, including when Queen Victoria and King Edward VII ascended the throne, respectively. In 1936, leader of the opposition Clement Attlee introduced an amendment to the civil list bill which would have seen the duchies surrendered in exchange for an adjusted annual sum of money tied to the actual cost of royal functions, but the amendment was defeated. In 1971, a private member&#x27;s bill to nationalise the duchy was defeated, but more than 100 MPs supported it.

In 2011, the duchy established a rebalancing asset plan and sold most of the Winmarleigh estates farms in Lancashire, and donated a plot of land to the Winmarleigh Village Hall committee by June 2012.

In 2017, the Paradise Papers revealed that the duchy held investments in two offshore financial centres, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Both are British Overseas Territories of which Queen Elizabeth II was monarch. Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn posited that the Queen should apologise, saying that anyone who keeps money offshore for tax avoidance purposes should &quot;not just apologise for it, [but] recognise what it does to our society.&quot; A spokesman for the duchy said that all of their investments are audited and legitimate, and that the Queen voluntarily pays taxes on income she receives from duchy investments. The duchy&#x27;s investments were revealed to include First Quench Retailing off-licences and rent-to-own retailer BrightHouse. The palace later stated that offshore investments had been exited by 2019.

==Role and administration==
The duchy is administered on behalf of the sovereign by the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, a government minister appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the prime minister, and by the clerk of the council. The former position is sometimes held by a cabinet minister, but is always a ministerial post. For at least the last two centuries the duchy has been run by a deputy; the chancellor has rarely had any significant duties pertaining to its management but is available as a minister without portfolio and is answerable to Parliament for the effective running of the estate.

The monarch derives the privy purse from the revenues of the duchy. The surplus for the year ended 31 March 2015 was £16 million and the duchy was valued at just over £472 million. Its land holdings are not to be confused with the Crown Estate, whose revenues have been handed to the Treasury since the 18th century in exchange for the receipt of a yearly payment.

The Duchy Council&#x27;s primary officers carrying out the estate&#x27;s day-to-day duties are the clerk of the council of the duchy of Lancaster (the chief executive officer), the chairman of the council, and the chief finance officer. The chancellor is responsible for the appointment of the steward and the barmaster of the barmote courts on behalf of the sovereign in right of the duchy.

Since the Local Government Act 1972, the monarch in right of the duchy appoints the high sheriffs and lords lieutenant in Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Lancashire.

==Royal prerogative==
Both the duchy of Lancaster and the duchy of Cornwall have special legal rights not available to other estates held by peers or counties palatine. For example, in the United Kingdom &quot;bona vacantia&quot; (&quot;ownerless property&quot;) is generally administered by the Crown, but within the county palatine is administered by the duchy.

==Holdings==

The holdings of the duchy are divided into eight units called surveys: five rural, one urban, one foreshore and one mineral. The rural surveys make up most of the assets and area but the urban survey generates a greater income. The holdings were accrued over time through marriage, inheritance, gift and confiscation, and in modern times by purchase and sale.

==Revenue, income, and tax==

As of the financial year ending 31 March 2022, the estate was valued at £652.8 million. The net income of the duchy is paid to the reigning sovereign, and amounts to about £24 million per year. As the duchy is an inalienable asset of the Crown held in trust for future sovereigns, the current sovereign is not entitled to the portfolio&#x27;s capital or capital profits. The Duchy of Lancaster is not subject to tax, but the monarch has voluntarily paid both income and capital gains tax since 1993.

Revenue surplus or income from the Duchy of Lancaster has increased considerably over time. In 1952, the surplus was £100,000 a year. Almost 50 years later in 2000, the revenue surplus had increased to £5.8M. In 2010, the revenue surplus stood at £13.2M, and by 2017, the surplus had grown to £19.2M.

In October 2024, an investigation by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and Channel 4&#x27;s Dispatches reported that the royal family profited from the NHS through a 15-year lease signed in 2023 by the duchy, which charged NHS Foundation Trust £829,000 annually for a central London warehouse. This arrangement raised concerns about financial transparency. Critics, including Edward Leigh and Margaret Hodge, called for the royal duchies to pay corporation tax and condemned the monarchy for profiting from public services. The royal income sources included the Sovereign Grant, the Duchy of Lancaster, and the Duchy of Cornwall, which together generate significant revenue and enjoy favorable tax status. The investigation also highlighted fees charged for military training and mooring rights on royal properties, with both duchies asserting they operated as commercial entities in compliance with disclosure requirements while emphasizing commitments to sustainability and community support.

<doc id="235457" wikidata="Q162754" url="?curid=235457" title="Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster">
<text>The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is a ministerial office in the Government of the United Kingdom. Excluding the prime minister, the chancellor is the highest ranking minister in the Cabinet Office, immediately after the prime minister, and senior to the Minister for the Cabinet Office. The role includes as part of its duties the administration of the estates and rents of the Duchy of Lancaster.

Formally, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the prime minister, and is answerable to Parliament for the governance of the Duchy. In modern times, however, the involvement of the chancellor in the running of the day-to-day affairs of the Duchy is slight, and the office is held by a senior politician whose main role is usually quite different. In practical terms, it is a sinecure, allowing the prime minister to appoint an additional minister without portfolio to the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

The role is typically held by a close ally of the Prime Minister entrusted to support the delivery of their current priorities. In 2021, the role was endowed with responsibility for advising the prime minister on Brexit policy. 
In the Starmer ministry, the role was given responsibility for supporting delivery of the government&#x27;s strategic priorities, Cabinet Office policy, cleaning up politics, and national security and resilience.

==History==

Originally, the chancellor was the chief officer in the daily management of the Duchy of Lancaster and the County Palatine of Lancaster (a county palatine merged into the Crown in 1399), but that estate is now run by a deputy, leaving the chancellor as a member of the Cabinet with little obligation in regard to the chancellorship. The position has often been given to a senior Cabinet minister with responsibilities in a particular area of policy for which there is no department with an appropriate portfolio.

In 1491, the office of Vice-Chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster was created. The position is now held by a judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, who sits in the north west of England, and is no longer appointed to that position as legal officer of the Duchy.

===Modern times===
Under the Promissory Oaths Act 1868, the chancellor is required to take the oath of allegiance and the Official Oath. The holder of the sinecure is a minister without portfolio; Sir Oswald Mosley, for example, focused on unemployment after being appointed to the position in 1929 during the second MacDonald ministry.

Following the Dardanelles campaign, Winston Churchill was in 1915 appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a humiliating loss of the trappings of power.

The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is entitled to a salary under the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975, but section 3 of the act provides that the salary &quot;shall be reduced by the amount of the salary payable to him otherwise than out of moneys so provided in respect of his office&quot;. The office of the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is part of the Cabinet Office.

From 1997 until 2009, the holder of the title also served as the Minister for the Cabinet Office. This applied in the case of Alan Milburn, who was given the title by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2004 and at the same time rejoined the Cabinet. However, in the reshuffle of 5 June 2009, the chancellorship went to the Leader of the House of Lords, the Baroness Royall. In David Cameron&#x27;s first cabinet, the chancellorship remained with the leader of the House of Lords until 2014.

When David Lidington was appointed chancellor on 8 January 2018, the position of Minister for the Cabinet Office was once again held concurrently. This continued until Michael Gove was appointed chancellor in July 2019. Michael Gove was given responsibility over the Cabinet Office, but did not initially hold the ministerial position of Minister for the Cabinet Office (which is not on a statutory footing). He was later granted that title in the 2020 Cabinet reshuffle and the two positions remained together until February 2022.

==Responsibilities==
In addition to administering the estates and rents of the Duchy of Lancaster, the chancellor is also a member of the cabinet and advises the prime minister on the development and implementation of government policy. As of 2025, the Chancellor is presently responsible for:

* Missions - supporting delivery of Government’s priorities
* Oversight of all Cabinet Office policy
* National security, resilience, and civil contingencies, including:
** COBR
** Resilience policy
** Cyber security
** State threats
** National Security and Investment Act
* Propriety and ethics
* Public appointments
* Major events policy

<text>Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Limited (), also known as Cathay Dragon () and until 2016, Dragonair, was a Hong Kong-based international regional airline, with its corporate headquarters and main hub at Hong Kong International Airport. In the final year before it ceased flying, the airline operated a scheduled passenger network to around 50 destinations in 14 countries and territories across Asia. Additionally, the airline had three codeshares on routes served by partner airlines. It had an all-Airbus fleet of 35 aircraft, consisting of A320s, A321s, and A330s.

Cathay Dragon is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong&#x27;s flag carrier, [[Cathay Pacific]], and was an affiliate member of the Oneworld airline alliance. The airline was founded on 24 May 1985, by Chao Kuang Piu, who was most recently the airline&#x27;s honorary chairman. Its maiden flight departed Hong Kong for Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia, after being granted an air operator&#x27;s certificate (AOC) by the Hong Kong Government in July 1985. In 2010, Dragonair, together with its parent, Cathay Pacific, operated over 138,000 flights, carried nearly 27 million passengers and over 1.80 billion kg (4.0 billion pounds) of cargo and mail.

== History ==

=== Early beginning ===

The airline was established in Hong Kong on 24 May 1985, on the initiative of Chao Kuang Piu as a subsidiary of Hong Kong Macau International Investment Co. It started operations in July 1985 with a Boeing 737-200 service from Kai Tak Airport to Kota Kinabalu International Airport in Malaysia, after receiving an Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate (AOC) from the Hong Kong Government. The airline began services to Phuket International Airport in Thailand, as well as six secondary cities in mainland China on a regular charter basis in 1986. In 1987, the airline became the first Hong Kong-based airline to join as an active member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Dragonair was the first local competitor for Hong Kong&#x27;s largest airline, Cathay Pacific, in forty years; and since the airline&#x27;s inception, Cathay Pacific has fought vigorously to block the airline&#x27;s flight-slot applications. In January 1987, the airline announced its expansion with the order of two long-range McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft. However, after a heated hearing before Hong Kong&#x27;s Air Transport Licensing Authority, the Hong Kong government adopted a one-route-one-airline policy, which lasted until 2001. The airline was not able to gain the scheduled routes it needed to compete effectively. The airline was disadvantaged in that Hong Kong&#x27;s financial secretary back then, Sir John Bremridge, was a former Cathay Pacific chairman.

Stephen Miller, Dragonair&#x27;s first CEO, said: Our arrival on the scene was not hailed very enthusiastically by the then Hong Kong Government...we got a lot of opposition from Cathay (Pacific). It was later discovered that Cathay Pacific was concentrating on a boom in travel elsewhere in the 1980s and had left the undeveloped mainland China market to Dragonair. Forced into accepting less-desirable routes, the young airline focused on the mainland.

=== 1990s ===
In January 1990, Cathay Pacific, Swire Group and CITIC Pacific acquired an 89 percent stake in the airline, with CITIC Pacific holding 38 percent; while the family of the airline&#x27;s chairman, Kuang-Piu Chao, reduced their holding from 22 percent to 6 percent, with the remainder held by minor shareholders. The change of ownership saw Cathay Pacific transferring its Beijing and Shanghai routes to Dragonair, along with a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar on a lease basis. The first Airbus A320 joined the airline&#x27;s fleet in March 1993 and by December, there was a total of six A320 aircraft. This was followed by the introduction of the Airbus A330 into the Dragonair&#x27;s fleet in July 1995.

A further redistribution of shares took place in April 1996, when China National Aviation Corporation purchased 35.86 per cent of Dragonair and became the largest shareholder, with Cathay Pacific and Swire retaining 25.50 per cent, CITIC Pacific retaining 28.50 percent and the Chao family retaining 5.02 percent. CNAC&#x27;s holding was further increased to 43 per cent when it was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 17 December 1997. On 5 July 1998, Dragonair Flight 841 from Chongqing was the last scheduled arrival at Kai Tak Airport, landed runway 13 at 15:38 GMT (23:38 Hong Kong time).

=== Operational expansion ===

In 2000, the airline commenced an all-cargo service to Shanghai, Europe and the Middle East using a leased Boeing 747-200 freighter and a service to Osaka was added in May 2001. The airline purchased two Boeing 747-300 freighters in 2001 and extended freight operations to Xiamen and Taipei in 2002. The airline&#x27;s net profits rose 60 percent to HK$540 million in 2002, with cargo operations accounting for 30 percent of revenues; and freight volume increasing nearly 50 percent to 20,095 tonnes.

All regular flights were converted to scheduled services in March 2000, with passenger service to Taipei, Bangkok and Tokyo commenced in July 2002, November 2003 and April 2004, respectively. Dragonair Cargo continued to see steady growth and the airline began a Hong Kong–Shanghai freight route on behalf of DHL in June 2003 and leased an Airbus A300 freighter to start a cargo service to Nanjing in June 2004. A second daily European loop to Frankfurt and London, in addition to Manchester and Amsterdam, followed, and by mid 2004, the airline had five Boeing 747 freighters and 26 Airbus passenger aircraft. In a bitter Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) hearings in 2004, Cathay Pacific applied to fly to three mainland cities to which Dragonair filed an objection, saying the move would have an effect on its very survival.

A new passenger service to Sydney was scheduled to open in the second half of 2005, along with Manila and Seoul as the other anticipated destinations. The airline also planned services to the United States in 2005, at first with cargo flights. It was the airline&#x27;s intention to more than double its freighter fleet to nine Boeing 747s by 2008.

=== Cathay Pacific takeover ===
By 2005, Cathay Pacific owned 18 per cent of the airline, with its parent, Swire Pacific owned 7.71 per cent; China National Aviation Holding owned 43 per cent and CITIC Pacific owned 28.5 per cent. The &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; reported in March 2005 that Swire Pacific was in advanced negotiations that would see Cathay Pacific taking over Dragonair. This was dismissed outright by Tony Tyler, then chief operating officer of Cathay Pacific who said &quot;We have no plans to change that structure right now... we are happy with the structure of the shareholding in Dragonair at the moment.&quot; Peter Hilton, transport analyst at CSFB, said Tyler&#x27;s remarks were a &quot;cut and dried&quot; dismissal of the takeover talk.

On 28 September 2006, Dragonair became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific after completion of a major shareholding realignment involving Cathay Pacific, Air China, China National Aviation Corporation Group, CITIC Pacific and Swire Pacific. Cathay Pacific claimed that Dragonair would continue to operate as a separate airline within the Cathay Pacific group, maintaining its own Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate and with the brand unchanged, with 2,976 employees worldwide. However, the airline would be downsized with five percent of the airline staff retrenched or transferred into Cathay Pacific. No Cathay Pacific staff were to be affected by this announcement.

By 2009, services to Bangkok and Tokyo, and the expansion plans to introduce services to Sydney, Seoul and the United States, had been cancelled and terminated while Cathay took over these routes with immediate effect. In addition, the planned nine-aircraft freight operation had also been eliminated, with three Boeing 747-400BCF freighters transferred to its parent fleet and the remaining two parked at Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California.

On 7 June 2010, Dragonair received its first second-hand Airbus A330-300 from Cathay Pacific to replace their leased A330s.

=== Service integration with Cathay Pacific ===
Dragonair&#x27;s own loyalty programme, &quot;The Elite&quot;, that was launched on 12 February 2001, was merged into Cathay Pacific&#x27;s The Marco Polo Club from 1 January 2007. Existing Elite members were offered similar membership by The Marco Polo Club. On 1 August 2007, the airline opened a joint regional office with Cathay Pacific in Beijing, that featured a dedicated area for the airline and its parent, and joined the Oneworld alliance as an affiliated member on 1 November, of which its parent is a founding member. In addition, they opened the first airline-branded arrival lounge, &quot;The Arrival&quot;, at Hong Kong International Airport on 1 October 2008. The airline&#x27;s ground handling services subsidiary, Hong Kong International Airport Services Ltd (HIAS), was merged with Hong Kong Airport Services Ltd (HAS) on 1 November 2008 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific on 1 December 2008.

In January 2016, Cathay Pacific announced it was rebranding Dragonair as Cathay Dragon. The Cathay Dragon brand became active on 21 November 2016.

=== Demise ===
On 21 October 2020, it was announced by Cathay Pacific that as part of the restructuring due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cathay Dragon would cease operations with immediate effect. Almost every cabin crew and pilots, along with the vast majority of the staff at the regional subsidiary, were laid off.

== Destinations ==

Before ceasing operations, the airline operated its own aircraft to 47 destinations including 22 destinations in mainland China from its home base Hong Kong.

=== Codeshare agreements ===
Cathay Dragon had codeshare agreements with the following partner airlines:
* Air Canada
* Air China
* American Airlines
* Bangkok Airways
* Cathay Pacific
* Finnair
* Malaysia Airlines
* Qantas
* S7 Airlines
* Shenzhen Airlines
== Final Fleet ==

=== Pre-merger fleet ===
Cathay Dragon operated an all–Airbus fleet in a mix of single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft. The fleet consisted of the following aircraft prior to folding into Cathay Pacific:

=== Former fleet ===
== Livery ==


The airline&#x27;s original livery consists of a thick red-coloured horizontal strip along a white-coloured fuselage with a red-coloured vertical stabiliser. The airline&#x27;s traditional Chinese and English name and its logo are in gold colour and are painted on the forward fuselage above the red horizontal strip and on the vertical stabiliser, respectively.

The previous livery is in white colour with a red dragon on the cowling and on the vertical stabiliser; and the airline&#x27;s name written in Chinese red lettering and in English black lettering above and below the front passenger windows, respectively. In addition, there is a 30 cm Oneworld logo next to the first left door and a Swire Group logo on the aft of the aircraft.

On 5 May 2005, Dragonair celebrated its 20th anniversary with a new Airbus A330-300 (B-HWG) painted in a special livery. The work of art took 14 months to create, from design tender to completed image. The special livery featured a waterside view with a junk and fishes leaping out of the water at the front of the aircraft; a red dragon spread across the fuselage in the daylight; and children playing with traditional Chinese lanterns by the waterside of an ancient village on the left side of the aircraft, representing the past. It also featured a waterside view with a Star Ferry at front of the aircraft; and a red dragon spread across the fuselage in the Hong Kong night sky, representing the present. Stanley Hui, Dragonair&#x27;s CEO at the time, described the special livery &quot;embodies the spirit of the Chinese dragons of old – a spirit that aspires to excellence&quot;. The aircraft was removed from service in February 2013, at the expiration of its lease.

On 1 June 2010, Dragonair celebrated its 25th anniversary, with a special livery painted on an Airbus A330-300 (B-HYF). The livery also bears the slogan, &quot;Serving you for 25 years&quot; on the right side on the aircraft, and its Chinese slogan is on the left side of the aircraft. It also has a golden dragon spreading across the fuselage along with several grey Chinese letters on it. It was repainted to the standard livery in March 2014.

In 2016, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair&#x27;s parent company, announced that they would be re-branding Dragonair to Cathay Dragon. It now uses the logo of its parent company, using light maroon color. For this change, a new hybrid livery has been adopted. The new livery is similar to Cathay Pacific&#x27;s new livery in the tail logo and font. The major difference is instead of the Cathay Pacific green theme, it has a light maroon theme. The titles reads &quot;Cathay Dragon&quot; along with Chinese lettering reading the name. The airline&#x27;s previous logo has been retained and appears next to the cockpit windows. The new livery first appeared on an Airbus A330-300 (B-HYQ). An Airbus A330-300 (B-HLJ) was the last remaining aircraft that had the Dragonair livery until it was retired in July 2020.

On 1 June 2017, In the celebration of the 20th year of independence in Hong Kong, Cathay Dragon received its special &quot;The Spirit of Hong Kong&quot; livery. It is painted on an Airbus A330-300 (B-HYB), and it is the sister aircraft to Cathay Pacific&#x27;s Boeing 777-300 (B-HNK), and was retired on 24 September 2020, after its last flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong as KA877.

== Loyalty programmes ==

Cathay Dragon shared two loyalty programmes with its parent company, Cathay Pacific: The Marco Polo Club (The Club), a loyalty programme, and Asia Miles, a travel reward programme. Members of The Club are automatically enrolled as Asia Miles members.

== Services ==

Food and beverages served on flights from Hong Kong were provided by LSG Lufthansa Services Hong Kong Ltd, a Cathay Dragon associate. 
A variety of regional dishes, such as dim sum, Fokkien fried rice, barbecue pork with fried rice and chicken with Thai sweet chilli, was served on flights into mainland China. However, only beverages and pastries were served in Economy Class for flights between Hong Kong and Changsha, Clark, Guangzhou, Haikou and Sanya.

In addition, the airline provided a range of different newspapers and magazines from around the world, including the airline&#x27;s in-flight magazine &quot;Emporium&quot;.
Beginning in March 2013, the majority of the airline&#x27;s fleet was retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific.
The new design features a Cathay Pacific-like ambience infused with traditional Chinese art designs. Seats in both classes will be fitted with StudioKA (a rebranded version of the StudioCX inflight entertainment system on board Cathay Pacific aircraft), which features a 12.1-inch (Business Class) or 9-inch (Economy Class) touchscreen display, a multipurpose controller Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD), support for iOS devices, and a USB port for connectivity to other devices. Worldwide in-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers. The new Business Class features a 21-inch wide recliner seat with 45 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 47 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch, while the new Economy Class will be 18.1 inches wide with 30 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 32 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch. The retrofitting process is completed by the end of 2014.

<text>Sertab Erener (born 4 December 1964) is a Turkish singer, songwriter and composer. With her coloratura soprano voice, she started working as a backing vocalist for Sezen Aksu, and with Aksu&#x27;s help she released her first studio album in the 1990s. Because of her education in classical music, she initially had difficulties in performing pop music. Although she did experimental works from time to time, she eventually preferred to focus on making pop music instead of avant-garde works, in order to make her music heard by a larger audience. In some of her works, she combined Western music and Eastern music, and benefited from operas as well as classical Turkish music with ethnic elements. With her entrance to Europe&#x27;s market in the early 2000s, many of her works were also sold in Turkey as well as European countries.

With Sezen Aksu&#x27;s help, she made her debut in 1992 with the album &quot;Sakin Ol!&quot;, and made herself known as a Turkish pop music artist in the 1990s by releasing the albums &quot;Lâ&#x27;l&quot; (1994), &quot;Sertab Gibi&quot; (1997) and &quot;Sertab Erener&quot; (1999). From these albums, the songs &quot;Sakin Ol!&quot;, &quot;Aldırma Deli Gönlüm&quot;, &quot;Ateşle Barut&quot;, &quot;Sevdam Ağlıyor&quot;, &quot;Aslolan Aşktır&quot;, &quot;Yanarım&quot;, &quot;Zor Kadın&quot; and &quot;Vur Yüreğim&quot; became number-one hits in Turkey. In the early 2000s, she continued her work by releasing the songs &quot;Kumsalda&quot; and &quot;Kendime Yeni Bir Ben Lazım&quot;. She won the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 with the song &quot;Everyway That I Can&quot;, marking Turkey&#x27;s first victory in the competition. In 2004, she released the album &quot;No Boundaries&quot;, followed by &quot;Aşk Ölmez&quot; in 2005. After five years, she released another Turkish studio album &quot;Rengârenk&quot; in 2010, and the hit songs &quot;Bu Böyle&quot;, &quot;Açık Adres&quot; and &quot;Koparılan Çiçekler&quot; made the album a successful work, and marked her return to the music market. After &quot;Rengârenk&quot;, she released the album &quot;Ey Şuh-i Sertab&quot; (2012), which was dedicated to her father. At the same year, she received the Best Female TSM Soloist award at the Golden Butterfly Awards. In 2013, her new album &quot;Sade&quot; was released. The songs &quot;İyileşiyorum&quot;, &quot;Öyle de Güzel&quot; and &quot;Söz&quot; all became hits in Turkey. In 2016, with the release of &quot;Kırık Kalpler Albümü&quot;, Erener stated that she was returning to her 90s style. The album received favorable reviews, and &quot;Kime Diyorum&quot; and &quot;Olsun&quot; both became hit songs in Turkey.

Erener has been praised for her music style and is one of the most successful artists who were discovered by Sezen Aksu. Due to her championship in Eurovision, she received the State Medal of Distinguished Service. In 2014, &quot;Hürriyet&quot; named her in its list of &quot;91 Symbols of the 91st Anniversary of the Republic&quot;. Aside from her career as a singer, she also taught music at Müjdat Gezen Art Center for one year. Erener has been married three times, the second of which was to Levent Yüksel during 1990–96. She married Emre Kula in 2015. Throughout her career she has won seven Kral TV Video Music Awards as well as two Golden Butterfly Awards, and has received various other nominations.

== Life and career ==
=== 1964–1991: Early life and career beginnings ===
Sertab Erener was born on 4 December 1964 in Istanbul as the second child of Nizamettin and Yücel Erener. She spent her childhood in Eyüp, Istanbul. Her mother&#x27;s family is from Yugoslavia but moved to Ayvalık, Balıkesir, due to the war in Eastern Europe. Her mother Yücel, had studied painting at Istanbul State Fine Arts Academy and graduated in 1957, but did not continue her career after marriage. Her paternal family was from Eastern Anatolia Region. Her paternal grandfather was from Muş, while her paternal grandmother was from Siirt. Her father Nizamettin, was born in Diyarbakır. He took music lessons form Şerif İçli and worked as a soloist on Istanbul Radio for one month. Despite his interest in music, he eventually preferred to become a lawyer. Sertab&#x27;s elder brother is Serdar, who had a great influence on her during her childhood. Sertab Erener grew up with her father&#x27;s passion for Turkish classical music. Due to his fondness of the song &quot;Ey Şûh-i Sertab&quot;, her father decided to name her Sertab, meaning the &quot;main light (radiance)&quot;. After finishing her primary school, she got the permission to enroll in Liceo Italiano di Istanbul, but her father sent her to Işık High School instead. During those years, she suffered from jaundice and at the age of 11 was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, for which she was hospitalized numerous times during her high school years. While she was at the second grade of high school, she became immensely interested in music and due to her fondness of opera music, she enrolled in Istanbul University State Conservatory to study opera. After taking singing lessons for a while, she continued her studies at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University. She studied at Mimar Sinan University, Opera Major Arts and Concert Singing Department, but left the school before completing her studies. Although she was taking classical music lessons at the time, she decided to continue her career with opera, however, since she was not able to obtain what she expected from opera in her student years, she started to work as a stage soloist. At the age of 21, she got married and this marriage lasted for three years.

Sertab joined Sezen Aksu&#x27;s birthday party in 1987 at Memduh Paşa Mansion as a soloist. She was chosen by the organizer of the party to perform at the event. Sezen Aksu noted Erener&#x27;s drabness during their first meeting, but she liked her voice and offered her a job as a backing vocalist. Erener initially did not want to accept the offer and later said: &quot;She [Sezen Aksu] asked me to become her backing vocalist. I didn&#x27;t accept it. Because I was already a soloist. It sounded like taking a step backwards. I thought I shouldn&#x27;t be a vocalist because of my position.&quot; Later, due to her friend Levent Yüksel&#x27;s closeness with Aksu, Erener accepted the offer and became her backing vocalist. She later participated in the 1987 Kuşadası Golden Pigeon Music Competition under her married name, Sertab Altın, and performed the song &quot;Akdeniz&quot;. In 1989, she joined Klips ve Onlar and performed the song &quot;Hasret&quot; in the competition to represent Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1989. They were placed third and lost the chance to represent the country in the contest. In 1990, she again joined the first-stage competitions, performed the song &quot;Sen Benimlesin&quot; and ranked 6th. In the same year, she married Levent Yüksel. She later described her second marriage in an interview: &quot;Levent was one of my close friends; we were pals. He had girlfriends, I had boyfriends. We worked in the same orchestra. After divorce, I didn&#x27;t even realize how it happened, I can&#x27;t explain it, but it was a kind of affection or something like that. I had a lot of friends, but Levent was always special to me, and had a separate place. I think I was feeling something special about him. It happened spontaneously without even pushing.&quot;

=== 1992–1998: &quot;Sakin Ol!&quot;, &quot;Lâ&#x27;l&quot; and &quot;Sertab Gibi&quot; ===
Erener&#x27;s name began to be heard in the early 1990s with Sezen Aksu&#x27;s help. She prepared her first studio album with the help of Aksu, Uzay Heparı, Aysel Gürel and Garo Mafyan. Aksu spent a lot of money and time to help Erener in her album&#x27;s preparations. Erener later talked about her experience: &quot;I learned this country and land&#x27;s music with Sezen&#x27;s help. It was after meeting her that I became truly interested in the music that I was making here [in Turkey]. That is why Sezen had a lot of trouble when she was making that cassette for me, thinking about where in this [music industry] I belong to. Because people were saying &#x27;Sertab sings well in English, but not in Turkish.&#x27; Those words had divided her mind in two parts.&quot; The album, titled &quot;Sakin Ol!&quot;, was released in 1992. Sertab Erener made a huge debut with the album&#x27;s lead single, also titled &quot;Sakin Ol!&quot;. To assist Erener, both Aksu and Uzay Heparı appeared on the song&#x27;s music video. &quot;Milliyet&quot; later wrote that thanks to &quot;Sakin Ol!&quot; Erener was brought suddenly to the top. With &quot;Sakin Ol!&quot;, she made her position solid in the market, and brought a breath of fresh air to Turkish pop music. Within 25 days of its release, it sold 300,000 copies. The number later rose to 750,000 copies. Alongside &quot;Sakin Ol!&quot;, separate music videos were released for the songs &quot;Aldırma Deli Gönlüm&quot;, &quot;Ateşle Barut&quot;, &quot;Vurulduk&quot;, &quot;Oyun Bitti&quot;, &quot;O, Ye&quot; and &quot;Suçluyum&quot;. In December 1992, Erener performed at TRT 1 and Kanal 6&#x27;s New Year programs.

On 13 March 1993, she gave a concert during the national selection in Turkey to choose the artist for the Eurovision Song Contest 1993. In June, &quot;Hey Girl&quot; magazine named her the Promising Singer of the Year. In July, she performed at Rumelihisarı. In 1993 and 1994, she went to the US and underwent three surgeries for ulcerative colitis from which she had been suffering since the age of 11. She later described her illness with these words: &quot;There was a wound in my bowel which didn&#x27;t heal for years. Hospitals, diets, resting, beds... I used to go to the bathroom 35 times a day. My intestines could not hold anything.&quot; All of her large intestine was taken out during the surgery and, as a result, she had to walk with a bag in her hand for a year. She began to question her own existence as she thought she was going to die from the disease, and in her head she started asking questions such as &quot;Why am I here? Why me?&quot;. Thus, she started studying philosophy books and began meditation.

In between her surgeries Erener began preparations for her second studio album &quot;Lâ&#x27;l&quot;, which was released on 14 October 1994. Most of the songs in the album were written by Sezen Aksu and it sold 640,000 copies. The album&#x27;s lead single was prepared for the documentary &quot;12 Mart: İhtilalin Pençesinde Demokrasi&quot; and dedicated to Deniz Gezmiş. It was later included in Sony Music&#x27;s &quot;Sony Music 100 Years: Soundtrack for a Century&quot; millennium set. Sertab Erener shot music videos for the songs &quot;Sevdam Ağlıyor&quot; and &quot;Rüya&quot; from this album. Sezen Aksu wrote the song &quot;Rüya&quot;, inspired by Erener&#x27;s illness and the sufferings that she endured following her surgeries. To promote &quot;Lâ&#x27;l&quot;, Erener gave a concert at the Bostancı Show Center, during which she performed &quot;Der Hölle Rache&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. Later, she said that she wanted to turn opera into a popular genre among the people. In March 1995, she won the Best Female Artist award at the 1st Kral TV Video Music Awards. In April, she performed at the &quot;Miss Turkey&quot; competition. In September, she joined the campaign &quot;We Go To the East with 1000 Artists&quot;, which was organized by Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and gave concerts in Eastern parts of Turkey.

In 1996, &quot;Kim&quot; magazine ranked Erener 6th on its list of the Frumpish Dressed Women. On 18 June 1996, Erener and her husband Levent Yüksel divorced. The couple later said that the reason behind their divorce was that &quot;Our 13-year love turned into sibling or parental feelings. We decided to obtain a divorce because we thought that marriage wouldn&#x27;t work out without love.&quot; In the same year, Erener voiced the character of Esmeralda in the Turkish version of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. She also started working with Mezarkabul&#x27;s guitarist Demir Demirkan. At the end of the year, preparations for her third studio album began. For the first time, she included songs that were written by herself in the album. She later talked about how she started songwriting: &quot;I&#x27;ve tried to tell you what I live and feel as well as I can. Even if I didn&#x27;t write it myself, I gave it to other songwriters to turn it into lyrics. I just acted as a commentator in my previous albums. This time, I work as a composer and songwriter.&quot; For her third studio album Erener signed a $100,000 contract with Sony Music and released &quot;Sertab Gibi&quot; in February 1997 under the labels of İmaj and Sony. Demir Demirkan also worked on the album. &quot;Hürriyet&quot;″s Lale Barçın İmer wrote that with &quot;Sertab Gibi&quot; Erener had taken an important step in her career. The songs &quot;Aslolan Aşktır&quot;, &quot;Seyrüsefer&quot;, &quot;İncelikler Yüzünden&quot;, &quot;Aaa&quot; and &quot;Yara&quot; were turned into music videos and &quot;Sertab Gibi&quot; sold 147,000 copies by August 1997.

Sertab Erener later joined the campaign &quot;Come on Southeast&quot;, and gave a concert on 26 August 1996 as a part of &quot;Southeast Education Mobilization Concerts&quot;. In the same month, it was reported that Melih Ayraçman of Sony Music Turkey was planning on introducing Sertab Erener to the European audience with new projects. In December, Erener assisted Our Children with Leukemia Foundation and joined José Carreras in performing at a fundraising concert for the foundation. Alongside her own music projects, she taught music at the Müjdat Gezen Art Center for one year.

=== 1999–2004: &quot;Sertab Erener&quot;, &quot;Turuncu&quot;, Eurovision and &quot;No Boundaries&quot; ===
Sony and Columbia released Erener&#x27;s self-titled album in March 1999, which included works such as the poem &quot;Makber&quot; by Abdülhak Hâmid Tarhan and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Der Hölle Rache&quot;. The album rose to the top of D&amp;R&#x27;s List of Best-Selling Albums in Turkey and sold 427,000 copies. &quot;Yanarım&quot;, &quot;Zor Kadın&quot;, &quot;Vur Yüreğim&quot; and &quot;Yolun Başında&quot; were the songs from &quot;Sertab Erener&quot; that were turned into music videos. &quot;Vur Yüreğim&quot; won the Best Lyrics award at the Kral TV Video Music Awards. &quot;Zor Kadın&quot; also became a number-one hit and was played on radios regularly. It was later re-released as a duet with Voice Male. In the same year Erener was featured on the song &quot;Private Emotion&quot; by Ricky Martin. Erener was scheduled to perform at Efes Pilsen&#x27;s 13th establishment anniversary on 16 August, which was set to be followed by a tour inside Turkey, but the concert was cancelled due to the 1999 İzmit earthquake. In September she continued her tour and donated her proceeds from the concerts to the earthquake survivors. In accordance with her plans, in 2000 she released the compilation album &quot;Sertab&quot; and gave a number of concerts in Europe. In April, for the National Sovereignty and Children&#x27;s Day, she gave a concert at Ephesus in front of 20,000 people. To make herself more known in Europe, she released the EP &quot;Bu Yaz&quot; in July. Greek singer Mando was featured on the Turkish-Greek song &quot;Aşk / Fos&quot;, which was included in the EP. &quot;Hürriyet&quot; wrote that with this duet Erener successfully earned a reputation in Greece.

In May 2001, Erener&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Turuncu&quot; was released. She later talked about her name choice for the album: &quot;Turuncu [Orange] represents positive energy besides being a color. My album also carries a cheerful, warm, positive energy. I made this album trying to link people to life. Because I had major health problems, even in times of sadness, I always preferred to stay positive.&quot; The album ranked number-one on D&amp;R&#x27;s List of Best-Selling Albums and sold 260,000 copies. The songs &quot;Kumsalda&quot; and &quot;Söz Bitti&quot; from &quot;Turuncu&quot; were later turned into music videos. In December, Erener won the Best Turkish Pop Music Female Soloist award at the Golden Butterfly Awards, and her new single &quot;Kendime Yeni Bir Ben Lazım&quot; was published.

In January 2003, TRT announced that Erener would represent Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest 2003. In February the name of the song was announced as &quot;Everyway That I Can&quot; and it was stated that the lyrics were in English. Turkish Language Association called for using a Turkish song instead to properly represent Turkish culture. Erener responded to the criticism by saying: &quot;It has to be in English to comply with world standards. Half of the world listens to English music, why should they not listen to a Turkish artist who sings in English? [...] People do not understand Turkish. If we find it difficult [to sing a suitable song] in our own language, why should we? When TRT asked me to write a song, I gave them my conditions. I said, &#x27;I want to sing the song in English&#x27;.&quot; The song was released on 8 March, and on 24 May in Riga, it earned 167 points earning Turkey its first victory in the contest and making it the host for the 2004 competition. &quot;Everyway That I Can&quot; entered the music charts of many European countries. In Sweden and Greece, it topped the official lists. Due to the song&#x27;s commercial success in these two countries, it received a gold and platinum certification from the two of them respectively.

After returning to Turkey, Erener received various awards due to her victory in Eurovision. She met with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and a reception was organized to celebrate her victory. She was also given the State Medal of Distinguished Service. She also received two Honorary Awards at the 1st MÜ-YAP Music Awards and 10th Kral TV Video Music Awards. She later performed Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; for the film &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; which was released in July 2003. In August, she played in one of the films prepared by UNICEF and Ministry of National Education for the campaign &quot;Come On Girls! Let&#x27;s Go To School&quot;. &quot;Sertab&quot; was re-released in Europe with new additions and sold 500,000 copies as of August 2003. On 26 September, she performed with a number of artists at the Royal Albert Hall in a fundraising event to help Iraqi children with leukemia.
In January 2004, Erener&#x27;s first English studio album &quot;No Boundaries&quot; was released in Europe. The album ranked number-one on Turkey&#x27;s List of Best-Selling Albums, and was followed by the singles &quot;Here I Am&quot;, &quot;Leave&quot; and &quot;I Believe (That I See Love in You)&quot;. Out of these songs, &quot;Here I Am&quot; was used in the teasers for the movie &quot;A Tale of Two Sisters&quot;. In March, Erener&#x27;s house was robbed and 15,000 of her properties were stolen. On 15 May, she opened the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 by performing the songs &quot;Everyway That I Can&quot; and &quot;Leave&quot;. Despite the debate over the format of the ceremony, Erener used sama dancers for her performance. In the same year, due to the emergence of problems &quot;in terms of singer-company relationship&quot;, she ended her contract with Sony Music and together with Demir Demirkan found the label Simya Müzik.

=== 2005–2009: &quot;Aşk Ölmez&quot; and &quot;Painted on Water&quot; ===
In January 2005, Erener performed at a fundraising concert for people who lost their homes at the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The proceeds from this concert, which were estimated to be around 126,000, were used to provide medical aid for the injured. Erener herself took the proceeds to Sri Lanka in February and described the experience as &quot;the biggest disaster I&#x27;ve seen since the day I was born&quot;. In May, after eight months of preparations, her seventh studio album &quot;Aşk Ölmez&quot; was released by the label Simya Müzik.

In April 2012, she released the classical Turkish album &quot;Ey Şûh-i Sertab&quot;, which was dedicated to her father Nizamettin Erener, after one year of preparations. Thanks to the album, which included 15 old classical Turkish songs, Erener won the &quot;Best Female Classical Turkish Music Soloist&quot; award at the Golden Butterfly Awards.

In April 2013, she released her new album, &quot;Sade&quot;.

In July 2015, Erener married her boyfriend Emre Kula in Seferihisar, İzmir, after 6 months of dating.

=== 2016–present: &quot;Kırık Kalpler Albümü&quot; and &quot;Ben Yaşarım&quot; ===
In June 2016, Erener&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Kırık Kalpler Albümü&quot; was published by GNL. The album&#x27;s first music video was made for the song &quot;Kime Diyorum&quot; and directed by Can Saban. The album&#x27;s production and arrangement was done by Erener&#x27;s husband Emre Kula.

In 2015, together with her husband guitarist Emre Kula, bassist Eser Ünsalan, keyboardist Ozan Yılmaz and drummer Alpar Lu she found the group Oceans of Noise and they started to make English rock music. In 2017, the group&#x27;s first EP was released. At the same time, they did the soundtrack for the movie &quot;&quot;. Beginning in late 2017, Erener started to perform on a musical titled &quot;Sertab&#x27;ın Müzikali&quot; to mark the 25th year of her career. During the musical, which consisted of two separate sections, Erener performed her hit songs from 1990s and 2000s and was accompanied by professional dancers. The preparations for the musical began in 2015 and Beyhan Murphy served as the show&#x27;s choreographer. The show also continued in 2018 and 2019. Eda Ünsün of &quot;Milliyet&quot; praised Erener and her band&#x27;s performance together the show&#x27;s visuals adding that &quot;a musical spree started in Turkey under the leadership of Erener&quot;.

In 2018, Oceans of Noise released their second EP &quot;Not Safe&quot;. In the same year, Erener released the singles &quot;Bastırın Kızlar&quot; and &quot;Belki de Dönerim&quot; in July and December respectively. The songs were both produced by Emre Kula and written by Can Bonomo.

Erener performed as one of the interval acts in the second semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Malmö.

== Artistry ==
=== Music style and voice ===
Erener&#x27;s voice possesses a 3-octave vocal range and is of coloratura soprano type. She is a pop music artist. Her songs are in &quot;a range of Middle Eastern melodies to club songs&quot;. In the 1980s, she was involved in opera when she was first introduced to music, but when she couldn&#x27;t find the success, she was expecting in the opera, she decided to make pop music instead. She later talked about the experience: &quot;It didn&#x27;t turn out the way I thought or imagined. Maybe it was another [type of] opera that I created within myself. How can I know? There was no such scholarship to go abroad, it didn&#x27;t exist. Later I said to myself that I&#x27;ll sing jingle. That way I make money. It&#x27;s best to do something on my own.&quot; She had a lot of difficulties with changing her style from opera to pop music. Semih Günver of &quot;Milliyet&quot; wrote about Erener in her article in 1994: &quot;What a colorful, sweet voice. This young woman is a great singer. A real soprano performer.&quot; Tolga Akyıldız also wrote about her in an article for &quot;Hürriyet&quot;: &quot;Sertab is one of the first brands of Turkish popular music with the power of both sound and song selection.&quot; Before becoming famous she performed in English for years, and as a result, in some parts of her first album &quot;Sakin Ol!&quot; she sang &quot;things she didn&#x27;t know the meaning of&quot;, and got tired with the efforts to figure out how to say and pronounce some words. In her second album, &quot;Lâ&#x27;l&quot;, she realized this problem and worked on the songs with more interest and stopped dealing with only the technical part of the project. With her third album, &quot;Sertab Gibi&quot;, she started songwriting and composing. Although she was more focused on the musical aspect of her works, her voice still stood out on the foreground. She later described &quot;Sertab Gibi&quot; as an experiment and said: &quot;It [the album] might have failed commercially at the time, but in terms of my career I came to the point where everyone said &#x27;Wow, look at this woman!&#x27; With this experience, I realized that I have to say what I want through music, and Turkish people&#x27;s appreciation can be won little by little, and I have to walk with them step by step and make the music. Otherwise, I have the capacity to produce completely avant-garde things, but it is something that only my friends would listen to. Yet I want to appeal to a wider audience. In this case, I believe that pop music is the right language to send the message and go one step further together.&quot;

Her fourth album &quot;Sertab Erener&quot; was found &quot;far from experimental works and more settled&quot; compared to her previous three albums. Her fifth album, &quot;Turuncu&quot;, was released with the purpose to connect people with life through a positive energy. She also demolished the image she had created with the song &quot;Zor Kadın (Difficult Woman)&quot; in the previous album with &quot;Güle Güle Şekerim (Bye Bye Sweetie)&quot; in the new one. &quot;Everyway That I Can&quot;, with which she joined Eurovision in 2003, was decorated with ethnic motifs and was a mixture of classical pop and Turkish music. Her seventh album, &quot;Aşk Ölmez&quot;, was prepared in a very unpretentious way. With &quot;Aşk Ölmez&quot;, Erener put aside the idea of &quot;I have to show all the information I&#x27;ve ever had in the first five minutes of the song, and I must reveal my voice there!&quot;. She later talked about the album: &quot;It&#x27;s a little bit fooling around with the idea of love and being human.. I believe there is a philosophy behind it. There are also small jokes, but the album is about women and men and their relationships... I tried to write about the conflicts that we have in between us, sometimes by taking it as a joke, and sometimes taking it seriously. These are the problems of the majority of people; after all, I don&#x27;t live anything apart from them. As a person who lives in a big city, I talk about such person&#x27;s issues. Based on these, I wrote the lyrics of the album.&quot; Together with Demir Demirkan, she released the jazz fusion album &quot;Painted On Water&quot;, which included türküs that were rewritten in English and re-performed. With her eighth album &quot;Rengârenk&quot;, she put &quot;diva acts aside&quot; and sang in a more calm manner.

=== Influences ===

Erener spent her childhood listening to her father&#x27;s performances of classical Turkish songs. Alanis Morissette, Sting and Tina Turner were among her favorite artists. &quot;Milliyet&quot;″s Orhan Kahyaoğlu later said that &quot;despite the influence of Sezen Aksu, she was easily stripped from Sezen&#x27;s music style due to her own refinement and artistic background.&quot; Erener said that before Sezen Aksu, she learned a lot during stage performances in terms of communicating with the audience. She has named Barbra Streisand as the &quot;woman of [her] life&quot;. She said that she constantly imitated Streisand before becoming famous, saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t say how I used to imitate her. I&#x27;ve studied this woman a lot, so much. When I decided to sing my own songs, I became aware that it doesn&#x27;t work like that, with imitation. After that I tried so hard to find the identity of my voice.&quot;

<text>A skyway, skybridge, skywalk, or sky walkway is an elevated type of pedway connecting two or more buildings in an urban area, or connecting elevated points within mountainous recreational zones. Urban skyways very often take the form of enclosed or covered footbridges that protect pedestrians from the weather. Open-top modern skyways in mountains now often have glass bottoms. Sometimes enclosed urban skywalks are made almost totally from glass, including ceilings, walls and floors. Also, some urban skyways function strictly as linear parks designed for walking.

In North America skyways are usually owned by businesses, and are therefore not public spaces (compare with sidewalk). However, in Asia, such as Bangkok&#x27;s and Hong Kong&#x27;s skywalks, they are built and owned separately by the city government, connecting between privately run rail stations or other transport with their own footbridges, and run many kilometers. Skyways usually connect on the first few floors above the ground-level floor, though they are sometimes much higher, as in the Petronas Towers. The space in the buildings connected by skyways is often devoted to retail business, so areas around the skyway may operate as a shopping mall. Non-commercial areas with closely associated buildings, such as university campuses, can often have skyways and/or tunnels connecting buildings.

The world&#x27;s largest discontinuous skyway network – Calgary, Alberta, Canada&#x27;s &quot;+15 Walkway&quot; system – has a total length of . The Minneapolis Skyway System is the world&#x27;s largest continuous system and spans connecting 80 blocks in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.

On a smaller scale, terminals of large airports are often connected by skywalk systems, as at Manchester Airport, United Kingdom; in many airports, retractable jet bridges provide a direct connection between airplanes and terminals.

Some cities have the equivalent of a skyway underground, and there are also mixed subway–skyway systems; see underground city.

== Early examples ==
* Florence, Italy, Vasari Corridor, connects Palazzo Vecchio to Uffizi and then to Palazzo Pitti, 16th century
* Venice, Italy, Bridge of Sighs, connects Doge&#x27;s Palace and prison, 16th century
* Copenhagen, Denmark: skywalk connecting courts building to adjacent uses, 18th century
* Faaborg, Funen, Denmark: skywalk in centrum, 18th century

== Environmental factors ==

Besides pedestrian safety and convenience, the chief reasons assigned by urban planners for skywalk development are decrease of traffic congestion, reduction in vehicular air pollution and separation of people from vehicular noise. A number of cities (for example, Spokane, Washington) have given intricate analysis to skywalk systems employing computer models to optimize skywalk layout.

== Negative impacts ==
There is debate about the negative impact on urban areas of skyways. Robertson (1988) noted the negative impacts to street activities, and reductions to the property value at ground level. Woo (2012) found that skywalk systems could be negatively associated with promoting consumerism. Cui (2015) called for more research into the impact of skyways in developing countries. The Cincinnati Skywalk in Ohio was dismantled because of these concerns.

== Cities with notable systems ==

===North America===
There are significant skyway networks in many cities in the US Midwest, such as Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Rochester, and Duluth. Most networks in North America are privately owned. Notable exceptions are skyways in Saint Paul and in New York (High Line), which are publicly owned.
===Asia===


The highest cantilevered skybridge between separate buildings in the world is in the Raffles City Chongqing skyscrapers complex in Chongqing, China. The world&#x27;s longest pedestrian hanging skywalk, at 430 meters, is the Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge, which sits between mountain peaks in China. The highest cantilevered skybridge as construction element of building exist atop of Kingdom Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The world&#x27;s highest 2-story skybridge, 170 m above the ground and 58 m long, between the two towers on 41st and 42nd floors in Petronas Twin Towers dual skyscrapers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which also has an elevated, air-conditioned walkway from the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre to Bukit Bintang shopping district. Malaysia also has the mountainarian tourist pedestrian glass-bottom Langkawi Sky Bridge in Kedah, Langkawi.

One of the most famous similar cantilevered skybridges, that looks like uppered ship from the bird&#x27;s-eye and submarine from the ground, known in Singapore&#x27;s Marina Bay Sands resort complex of skyscrapers.

One of the most impressionable hanging pedestrian skybridges, supported by two giant hands, Golden Bridge now attracts tourists in Ba Na Hills near Da Nang, Vietnam.

In Bangkok, Thailand there are more than 5.4 km of covered wide dedicated elevated skywalks with lighting. These were developed due to lack of proper sidewalks as well as street hawkers and local merchants taking advantage of any sidewalk space as makeshift commercial real estate. Common reasons skywalks were built include to avoid street pollution, dust, wetness from food vendors and/or rain, potholes, long queues, crowds, and uneven pavement, supporting urbanism but probably most importantly, tourism receipts. Most skywalks connect to a BTS station and utilize space underneath the rail line and BTS pillar supports. These skywalks have connector ramps which connect stations to malls seamlessly and are paid for by the malls themselves, otherwise the city and BTS fund walkway development. A 50km long extension project was shelved in 2011 due to funding issues, nevertheless the system is growing organically.

In Hong Kong, there are numerous foot bridge networks across the city. Particularly large networks exists around elevated or at grade MTR stations and connections between malls and housing estates in new town centers. The largest network spans Admiralty, Central and parts of Sheung Wan districts in the CBD and consists of the Central Elevated and Central–Mid-Levels Walkway systems which link up over 40 major office buildings. The Central–Mid-Levels walkway system is the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world according to Guinness World Records.[9][10] Other large systems exist in Tsuen Wan and Mong Kok.

The Mumbai Skywalk Project, India is a discontinuous network of over 50 km of skywalks in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, India. The skyways connect Mumbai Suburban Railway stations to important junctions, each 1 to 2 km in length. The first of these is a 1.3 km (0.8 mi) long skywalk connecting the suburban regions of Bandra and Kurla.

===Europe===
Brussels, Belgium has a skyway between the two Belgacom Towers.

London has skywalks on the Barbican Estate and London Wall. The City of London Pedway Scheme was devised as part of the post World War II reconstruction plans for London, it was put into effect mainly from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s and eventually abandoned by the 1980s. Shad Thames has picturesque skyways between former warehouses, used in part to roll barrels between them.

Liverpool conceived a project of building skyways around the city centre during the 1960s. The project saw bridges linking key buildings around the city centre, such as James Street railway station, Moorfields railway station and New Hall Place. Crime and low usage of the bridges stopped the project being fully imagined and by the end of the year 2000 nearly all of bridges had been removed, though evidence of the scheme still exists in some places.

Sheffield, South Yorkshire has a famous skyway between two blocks of flats in the Park Hill Estate housing block with the phrase &quot;I Love You Will U Marry Me&quot; graffitied onto it. It has since become the subject of songs by local singers and bands such as Arctic Monkeys and Yungblud.

The twin towers of the Highlight Towers in Munich, Germany are joined by two skyways made of glass and steel.

The Promenade Plantée in the 12th arrondissement of Paris, France includes pedestrian bridges and a linear park on an aqueduct of a former railway.

===Australia===
* Melbourne, Australia, four blocks and Airport
