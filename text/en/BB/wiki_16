<text>A lottery (or lotto) is a form of gambling that involves the drawing of numbers at random for a prize. Some governments outlaw lotteries, while others endorse it to the extent of organizing a national or state lottery. It is common to find some degree of regulation of lottery by governments. The most common regulations are prohibition of sale to minors and licensing of ticket vendors. Although lotteries were common in the United States and some other countries during the 19th century, by the beginning of the 20th century, most forms of gambling, including lotteries and sweepstakes, were illegal in the U.S. and most of Europe as well as many other countries. This remained so until well after World War II. In the 1960s, casinos and lotteries began to re-appear throughout the world as a means for governments to raise revenue without raising taxes.

Lotteries come in many formats. For example, the prize can be a fixed amount of cash or goods. In this format, there is risk to the organizer if insufficient tickets are sold. More commonly, the prize fund will be a fixed percentage of the receipts. A popular form of this is the &quot;50–50&quot; draw, where the organizers promise that the prize will be 50% of the revenue. Many recent lotteries allow purchasers to select the numbers on the lottery ticket, resulting in the possibility of multiple winners.

==Classical history==
The first recorded signs of a lottery are keno slips from the Chinese Han dynasty between 205 and 187 BC. These lotteries are believed to have helped to finance major government projects like the Great Wall of China. From the Chinese &quot;Book of Songs&quot; (2nd millennium BC.) comes a reference to a game of chance as &quot;the drawing of wood&quot;, which in context appears to describe the drawing of lots.

The first known European lotteries were held during the Roman Empire, mainly as an amusement at dinner parties. Each guest would receive a ticket, and prizes would often consist of fancy items such as dinnerware. Every ticket holder would be assured of winning something. This type of lottery, however, was no more than the distribution of gifts by wealthy noblemen during the Saturnalian revelries. The earliest records of a lottery offering tickets for sale is the lottery organized by Roman Emperor Augustus. The funds were for repairs in the City of Rome, and the winners were given prizes in the form of articles of unequal value.

==Medieval history==
The first recorded lotteries to offer tickets for sale with prizes in the form of money were held in the Low Countries in the 15th century. Various towns held public lotteries to raise money for town fortifications, and to help the poor. The town records of Ghent, Utrecht, and Bruges indicate that lotteries may be even older. A record dated 9 May 1445 at L&#x27;Ecluse refers to raising funds to build walls and town fortifications, with a lottery of 4,304 tickets and total prize money of 1737 florins (worth about US$170,000 in 2014). In the 17th century it was quite usual in the Netherlands to organize lotteries to collect money for the poor or in order to raise funds for a wide range of public usages. The lotteries proved very popular and were hailed as a painless form of taxation. The Dutch state-owned &quot;Staatsloterij&quot; is the oldest running lottery (1726). The English word lottery is derived from the Dutch noun &quot;lot&quot; meaning &quot;fate&quot;.

The first recorded Italian lottery was held on 9 January 1449 in Milan organized by the Golden Ambrosian Republic to finance the war against the Republic of Venice. However, it was in Genoa that &quot;Lotto&quot; became very popular. People used to bet on the name of Great Council members, who were drawn by chance, five out of ninety candidates every six months. This kind of gambling was called &quot;Lotto&quot; or &quot;Semenaiu&quot;. When people wanted to bet more frequently than twice a year, they began to substitute the candidates names with numbers and modern lotto was born, to which both modern legal lotteries and the illegal numbers game can trace their ancestry. 

==Early modern history==
===France, 1539–1836===
King Francis I of France discovered the lotteries during his campaigns in Italy and decided to organize such a lottery in his kingdom to help the state finances. The first French lottery, the &quot;Loterie Royale&quot;, was held in 1539 and was authorized with the edict of Châteaurenard. This attempt was a fiasco, since the tickets were very costly and the social classes which could afford them opposed the project.

Between 1757 and 1836, for a period of about 80 years with some interruption during the French Revolution, the French state ran a profitable &quot;Loterie&quot;. The project was born out a series of initiatives to fund the &quot;École militaire&quot;. Instrumental to the birth of the Loterie were Giacomo Casanova and the Calzabigi brothers (Giovanni and Ranieri). Casanova defended the project in a series of conversations with Madame de Pompadour, the French mathematician Jean d&#x27;Alembert, Joseph de Pâris Duverney, intendent of the École, and the French minister of foreign affair. Unlike modern lotteries where the state can never lose, in the French lottery the state could lose, but a wise choice of the payoff made losses so improbable as to ensure a profit for the state.

===England, 1566–1826===

Although the English probably first experimented with raffles and similar games of chance, the first recorded official lottery was chartered by Queen Elizabeth I, in the year 1566, and was drawn in 1569. The 400,000 tickets issued cost 10 shillings (£0.50) each (roughly three weeks of wages for ordinary citizens), with the grand prize worth roughly £5,000. This lottery was designed to raise money for the &quot;reparation of the havens and strength of the Realme, and towardes such other publique good workes&quot;, including the rebuilding of ports and new ships for the royal fleet. Each ticket holder won a prize, and the total value of the prizes equalled the money raised. Prizes were in the form of both &quot;ready money&quot; and valuable commodities such as silver plate, tapestries, and fine linen cloth. Additionally, each participant was granted immunity from one arrest, &quot;so long as the crime wasn&#x27;t piracy, murder, felonies, or treason.&quot; The lottery was promoted by scrolls posted throughout the country showing sketches of the prizes.
Thus, the lottery money received was an interest-free loan to the government during the three years that the tickets (&#x27;without any Blankes&#x27;) were sold. In later years, the government sold the lottery ticket rights to brokers, who in turn hired agents and runners to sell them. These brokers eventually became the modern-day stockbrokers for various commercial ventures. Most people could not afford the entire cost of a lottery ticket, so the brokers would sell shares in a ticket; this resulted in tickets being issued with a notation such as &quot;Sixteenth&quot; or &quot;Third Class&quot;.

Many private lotteries were held, including raising money for the Virginia Company of London to support its settlement in America at Jamestown. The English State Lottery ran from 1694 until 1826. Thus, the English lotteries ran for over 250 years, until the government, under constant pressure from the opposition in Parliament, declared a final lottery in 1826. This lottery was held up to ridicule by contemporary commentators as &quot;the last struggle of the speculators on public credulity for popularity to their last dying lottery&quot;.

===British North America 1612–1783===
An English lottery, authorized by King James I in 1612, granted the Virginia Company of London the right to raise money to help establish settlers in the first permanent English colony at Jamestown, Virginia.

Lotteries in colonial America played a significant part in the financing of both private and public ventures. It has been recorded that more than 200 lotteries were sanctioned between 1744 and 1776, and played a major role in financing roads, libraries, churches, colleges, canals, bridges, etc.
In the 1740s, the foundation of Princeton and Columbia Universities was financed by lotteries, as was the University of Pennsylvania by the Academy Lottery in 1755.

During the French and Indian Wars, several colonies used lotteries to help finance fortifications and their local militia. In May 1758, the Province of Massachusetts Bay raised money with a lottery for the &quot;Expedition against Canada&quot;.

Benjamin Franklin organized a lottery to raise money to purchase cannons for the defense of Philadelphia. Several of these lotteries offered prizes in the form of &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot;. George Washington&#x27;s Mountain Road Lottery in 1768 was unsuccessful, but these rare lottery tickets bearing Washington&#x27;s signature became collectors&#x27; items; one example sold for about $15,000 in 2007. Washington was also a manager for Col. Bernard Moore&#x27;s &quot;Slave Lottery&quot; in 1769, which advertised land and slaves as prizes in &quot;The Virginia Gazette&quot;.

At the outset of the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress used lotteries to raise money to support the Colonial Army. Alexander Hamilton wrote that lotteries should be kept simple, and that &quot;Everybody ... will be willing to hazard a trifling sum for the chance of considerable gain ... and would prefer a small chance of winning a great deal to a great chance of winning little&quot;. Taxes had never been accepted as a way to raise public funding for projects, and this led to the popular belief that lotteries were a form of hidden tax.

At the end of the Revolutionary War the various states had to resort to lotteries to raise funds for numerous public projects.

===German-speaking countries===
The first big lottery on German soil was held in 1614 in Hamburg.

In Austria the first lottery was drawn in 1751, during the reign of Empress Maria Theresia, and was named &quot;Lotto di Genova&quot; since it was based on 90 numbers.

===Spain, 1763===
Spain offers a wealth of lottery games, the majority of which are operated by Loterías y Apuestas del Estado with the remaining lotteries operated by the ONCE and the Catalan government. The first Spanish lottery game was played back in 1763 and, over the last two centuries, playing the lottery in Spain has developed into a tradition.

The Spanish Christmas Lottery (officially Sorteo Extraordinario de Navidad [soɾˈteo ekstɾaorðiˈnaɾjo ðe naβiˈðað] or simply Lotería de Navidad [loteˈɾia ðe naβiˈðað]) is a national lottery. It is organized every year since 1812 by a branch of the Spanish Public Administration, now called Loterías y Apuestas del Estado. The name Sorteo de Navidad was used for the first time in 1892.

The Spanish Christmas lottery is the second longest continuously running lottery in the world. This includes the years during the Spanish Civil War when the lottery draw was held in Valencia after the Republicans were forced to relocate their capital from Madrid. After the overthrow of the Republican government the lottery continued uninterrupted under the Franco regime.

==Modern history by country==
Notable prizes on different continents are:

===Australia===

The first lottery in Australia took place in the 1880s in Sydney. It was a private sweepstakes that was quickly prohibited, despite being moved to other areas such as Queensland and Victoria. In 1916, the Australian government started their own lottery, named the &#x27;Golden Casket Art Union&#x27;, with the intention of raising money for charities and projects. Its first draw is credited with raising funds for veterans of World War One.

===Canada===
Lotteries in Canada are administered by five regional organizations; the Atlantic Lottery Corporation (which serves Atlantic Canada), Loto-Québec, the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, the Western Canada Lottery Corporation (which serves Western and Northern Canada, excluding British Columbia), and the British Columbia Lottery Corporation. The five regional lotteries are members of a consortium known as the Interprovincial Lottery Corporation, which administrates national games, including the flagship Lotto 6/49 and Lotto Max. The five lotteries offer draw games, scratch cards, and sports betting—the latter primarily under the brand Sport Select.

The largest single jackpot record in Canadian lottery history was a Lotto Max drawing on January 7, 2020, for a jackpot of $70 million.

===Finland===

In Finland, Veikkaus began selling lottery tickets in December 1970, and the first draw was televised on January 3, 1971. The lottery turned 40 on January 3, 2011, and by then the lottery had been drawn 2,126 times. Since then, there has been one lottery draw every week. Lottery game time usually ends on Saturday at 9:45 p.m., and the draw is usually held on Saturday at 10:15 p.m. Large public holidays on Saturdays may postpone the draw to Sunday. The lottery has two official supervisors; from 3 January 1971 to 29 September 2013, the lottery was televised on Yle TV1, and in October 2013, the lottery draws were postponed on MTV3 after ten evening news, because according to FICORA, the sponsorship cooperation between Veikkaus and Yle was illegal.

In the current lottery played in Finland, the player chooses seven numbers between 1 and 40 (initially, until the autumn of 1980, six numbers between 1 and 40 were chosen, then for a few years seven numbers between 1 and 37 and then seven numbers between 1 and 39). In the draw, seven numbers and one (previously three and then two) additional numbers are drawn; the line price is 1 euro. The profit categories were changed, for example, from the 2011 round 41. The main victory at that time was with 7 correct results and the smallest victory with three actual and one additional number, the number of which was reduced from three to two. The lottery return percentage is 41.1.

Another lottery game played in Finland is Vikinglotto, which can be played in all Nordic countries as well as in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In Vikinglotto, six actual numbers and two additional numbers out of 48 are drawn. There are five winning categories: 6 correct, 5 + extra number, 5 correct, 4 correct and 3 correct.

In Finland, an average of six million euros in winnings go unredeemed each year.

===France===
A national lottery was reintroduced in 1933.

=== India ===
There are many lotteries in India. All lotteries are run by state governments but only 13 of the 28 Indian states allow them. The leader within Indian lotteries is the Kerala State Government that started their lottery department in 1967 following the country wide ban on private lotteries.

The Kerala State Lotteries became an inspiration for other Indian states that started their own lotteries. As of right now lotteries are available in Kerala, Goa, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Sikkim, Nagaland and Mizoram.

The public ban on lotteries in other states has not been very effective since several lottery providers allow Indians to play online. Indian players can play lotteries from all over the world thanks to online lottery agents and bookkeepers. Some states have tried to combat this with different measures. The state government of Tamil Nadu decided to ban GooglePay since it allows payments to online lotteries and awards its users in India with Scratchcards.

Indian lotteries provide a substantial economic boost for the states that provide them. In the fiscal year 2017–2018 Kerala collected GST worth Rs 908 crore and state revenue of Rs 1,691 crore.

===Malaysia===
Lottery industry start operated in Malaysia on early 1969 by Berjaya Group. Sports Toto Malaysia Sdn Bhd is a Malaysian company, which operates in the gambling sector.

Founded and incorporated by the Malaysian Government in 1969, it was focused on the commercialisation of 4-Digits–based games. On 1 August 1985, the government in a non-tender privatisation, sold the company to businessman Vincent Tan who merged it into his Berjaya Group.

Today, Sports Toto is a wholly owned subsidiary of Berjaya Sports Toto Berhad (MYX: 1562), which is listed on the main market of Bursa Malaysia. It claims to be the largest operator in Malaysia of 4D-based games, with 680 sales outlets offering a total of 7 games.

===Mexico===
The Mexican &quot;Lotería Nacional&quot; dates back to the late 18th century. The goal of the Lotería is to create jobs and to &quot;impulse the wealth redistribution process&quot;. The Lotería is also a member of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.

===Spain===

As measured by the total prize payout, the Spanish Christmas Lottery is considered the biggest lottery worldwide. In 2012, if all of the tickets had been sold, the total amount payout of prizes would have been worth €2.52 billion (70% of ticket sales). The total amount of all prizes of the first category called El Gordo (&quot;the fat one&quot;) was €720 million which was distributed among 180 winning tickets (billetes) that win €4 million each.

For 2013, due to falling demand, the number of €20 tickets available was reduced from 180 million to 160 million, reducing the potential maximum prize pool to €2.24 billion (70% of ticket sales), with a maximum potential El Gordo of €720 million.

===Thailand===
A lottery was first held in Thailand (then known as Siam) in 1874 during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), as part of an international fair organised for his birthday. A lottery was organised in 1917 by the British government with Thai consent to help finance Britain&#x27;s war effort. Lotteries were held intermittently until 1933, when they became regularised under the finance department.

The present Thai lottery is managed by The Government Lottery Office, a state enterprise managed by the Ministry of Finance. The drawings take place on the 1st and 16th of each month, with the top price now up to 32 million baht.

Shrines of local folklore and popular religion, such as Nang Ta-Khian, are often propitiated in order to be lucky in the Thai lottery draw.

===United Kingdom===

The principal lottery in the United Kingdom is the National Lottery, a state-franchised lottery sanctioned by the Gambling Commission (formerly the National Lottery Commission), and established in 1994. It is operated by Allwyn Entertainment Ltd, who took over from the original operator Camelot Group in 2024. 28% of National Lottery revenue, along with all unclaimed prizes, are distributed as grants to charitable causes. 12% of the revenue from the National Lottery is expected to go to the government, 5% goes to lottery retailers, 5% is retained by the operator for operating costs, and 50% remains for the total prize fund of which 5% is diverted to a Super Draw fund, leaving 45% for normal prizes.

Northern &amp; Shell also operates a commercial lottery known as The Health Lottery, which distributes its revenue to support health-related charities and causes. To comply with the Gambling Act, which forbids other parties from operating a national lottery, The Health Lottery operates as an umbrella corporation representing a group of 51 society lotteries across the United Kingdom with a common drawing and prize pool. Each drawing is held on behalf of one or more of the society lotteries, whose revenues go to support health-related causes in their respective area. The Health Lottery received criticism on launch for only pledging to donate 20.3% of ticket costs to charity, compared to the National Lottery&#x27;s 28%, and that the lottery&#x27;s structure was designed to contravene British law regarding lotteries. In the UK, winning the lottery is correlated to expressing more preference for the Conservative Party. Winning larger prizes results in a larger shift in favour of the Conservative Party.

People&#x27;s Postcode Lottery is a subscription lottery in the UK. The format was introduced by Dutch company Novamedia BV: players pay at minimum £10 monthly to play, and winning postcodes are announced daily. In accordance with restrictions under the Gambling Act 2005, the maximum amount which can be won by a single ticket is £500,000, or 10% of the total draw proceeds. A minimum of 33% of the ticket price from players&#x27; subscriptions supports various trusts, which in turn fund local and international charities and community projects. Some £850 million have been donated. People&#x27;s Postcode Lottery has a number of celebrity ambassadors, including David Attenborough, Judi Dench, Shobna Gulati, Tim Healy, Stephen Jardine, Ellen MacArthur, Aggie MacKenzie, Carey Mulligan, John Stapleton and Emma Thompson. The lottery was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, &quot;The Welsh Valley That Won the Lottery&quot;, about the residents of Rhymney who won in May 2022.

===United States===
Lotteries are operated at the state level in the U.S.; 45 states and 3 territories operate state lotteries, and nearly all of them are members of consortiums that operate regional games, and the two near-national games Mega Millions and Powerball. In November 2022, Powerball set a record for the largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history, with its 8 November 2022 draw having an estimated jackpot of US$2 billion.

The precursor to legal lotteries were the underground &quot;numbers game&quot; of the 1800s, which operated out of &quot;Policy shops&quot; where bettors choose numbers. In 1875, a report of a select committee of the New York State Assembly stated that &quot;the lowest, meanest, worst form ... [that] gambling takes in the city of New York, is what is known as policy playing&quot;. The game was also popular in Italian neighborhoods known as the Italian lottery, and it was known in Cuban communities as &quot;bolita&quot; (&quot;little ball&quot;). By the early 20th century, the game was associated with poor communities, and could be played for as little as $0.01. The game&#x27;s attractions to low income and working class bettors were the ability to bet small amounts of money, and that bookies could extend credit to the bettor. In addition, policy winners could avoid paying income tax. Different policy banks would offer different rates, though a payoff of 600 to 1 was typical. Since the odds of winning were 1000:1, the expected profit for racketeers was enormous.

The first modern government-run US lottery was established in Puerto Rico in 1934, followed by New Hampshire in 1964.

In 2018, Ohio became one of the first states to offer people a digital lottery option. The technology, developed by Linq3, allows players to play the lottery on their smart phones.

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, there are two types of lotteries: traditional lotteries, which are operated at the provincial level, and national electronic lotteries (notably Vietlott). The Ministry of Finance manages provincial lottery companies, and these lottery companies conduct lottery draws and award the winners. 

Accompanying the lottery is the betting game, an illegal form of lottery among the people, which uses the results of the jackpot of the legal traditional lottery as the prize-winning results. In Hanoi, the &quot;agent&quot; system of the betting game has developed along with traditional lottery stores and iced tea stalls, operating quite openly. In addition, some players have switched to online betting.

According to traditional lottery companies, the revenue from the traditional lottery is decreasing day by day because it cannot compete with Vietlott and the betting game.

==Mathematical analysis==
The purchase of lottery tickets cannot be accounted for by decision models based on expected value maximization. The reason is that lottery tickets cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, so someone maximizing expected value would not buy lottery tickets. People buy lottery tickets anyway, either because they do not understand the mathematics, or because they find the thrill and fantasy of becoming wealthy to be worthwhile. If this entertainment value and any other non-monetary value is factored into the utility function, a lottery ticket purchase can be considered rational according to expected utility maximization.

===Probability of winning===

The chances of winning a lottery jackpot can vary widely depending on the lottery design, and are determined by several factors, including the count of possible numbers, the count of winning numbers drawn, whether or not order is significant, and whether drawn numbers are returned for the possibility of further drawing.

In a simple 6-from-49 lotto, a player chooses six numbers from 1 to 49 (no duplicates are allowed). If all six numbers on the player&#x27;s ticket match those produced in the official drawing (regardless of the order in which the numbers are drawn), then the player is a jackpot winner. For such a lottery, the chance of being a jackpot winner is 1 in 13,983,816.

In bonusball lotteries where the bonus ball is compulsory, the odds are often even lower. In the Mega Millions multi-state lottery in the United States, 5 numbers are drawn from a group of 70 and 1 number is drawn from a group of 25, and a player must match all 6 balls to win the jackpot prize. The chance of winning the jackpot is 1 in 302,575,350

The odds of winning can also be reduced by increasing the group from which numbers are drawn. In the SuperEnalotto of Italy, players must match 6 numbers out of 90. The chance of winning the jackpot is 1 in 622,614,630.

Most lotteries give lesser prizes for matching just some of the winning numbers, with a lesser prize for fewer matches. Although none of these additional prizes affect the chances of winning the jackpot, they do improve the odds of winning something and therefore add a little to the value of the ticket.

==Scams and frauds==
Lotteries, like any form of gambling, are susceptible to fraud, despite the high degree of scrutiny claimed by the organizers. Numerous lottery scams exist.

Some advance fee fraud scams on the Internet are based on lotteries. The fraud starts with spam congratulating the recipient on their recent lottery win. The email explains that in order to release funds the email recipient must part with a certain amount (as tax/fees) as per the rules or risk forfeiture.

Another form of scam involves the selling of &quot;systems&quot; which purport to improve a player&#x27;s chances of selecting the winning numbers in a Lotto game. These scams are generally based on the buyer&#x27;s (and perhaps the seller&#x27;s) misunderstanding of probability and random numbers. Sale of these systems or software is legal, however, since they mention that the product cannot guarantee a win, let alone a jackpot.

There have also been several cases of cashiers at lottery retailers who have attempted to scam customers out of their winnings. Some locations require the patron to hand the lottery ticket to the cashier to determine how much they have won, or if they have won at all, the cashier then scans the ticket to determine one or both. In cases where there is no visible or audible cue to the patron of the outcome of the scan some cashiers have taken the opportunity to claim that the ticket is a loser or that it is worth far less than it is and offer to &quot;throw it away&quot; or surreptitiously substitute it for another ticket. The cashier then pockets the ticket and eventually claims it as their own.

The BBC TV series &quot;The Real Hustle&quot; showed a variation of the lottery scam in which a group of scammers pretended to have won a lottery, but was prevented from claiming the prize as the person who wrote the name on the back of the ticket was supposedly out of the country on that date. They were able to persuade a stranger to put up money as collateral in order to share in the prize pool.

On some occasions, the actual lottery draw itself has been compromised by fraudsters. The 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal involved weighting balls in &quot;The Daily Number&quot;. In the Hot Lotto fraud scandal software code was added to the &quot;Hot Lotto&quot; random number generator allowing a fraudster to predict winning numbers on specific days of the year.

In 2003, Mohan Srivastava, a Canadian geological statistician, found non-random patterns in &quot;Tic-Tac-Toe&quot; tickets sold by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. &quot;Tic-Tac-Toe&quot; was pulled off the shelves, and became the first game ever recalled by the OLG.

==Payment of prizes==
Winnings (in the U.S.) are not necessarily paid out in a lump sum, contrary to the expectation of many lottery participants. In certain countries, mainly the U.S., the winner gets to choose between an annuity payment and a one-time payment. The one-time payment (&quot;cash&quot; or &quot;lump sum&quot;) is a &quot;smaller&quot; amount than the advertised (annuity) jackpot, having regard to the time value of money, even before applying any income taxes to which the prize is subject. While withholdings vary by jurisdiction and how winnings are invested, it is suggested that a winner who chooses lump sum expects to pocket of the advertised jackpot at the end of the tax year. Therefore, a winner of a $90m jackpot who chooses cash can expect $30m net after filing income tax document(s) for the year in which the jackpot was won.

Lottery annuities are often for a period from 20 to 30 years. Some U.S. lottery games, especially those offering a &quot;lifetime&quot; prize, do not offer a lump-sum option. According to some experts, choosing the annuity is better than opting for the lump-sum, especially for those who lack investment experience.

In some online lotteries, the annual payments are only $25,000, with a balloon payment in the final year. This type of installment payment is often made through investment in government-backed securities. Online lotteries pay the winners through their insurance backup. However, many winners choose lump sum, since they believe they can get a better rate of return on their investment elsewhere.

In some countries, lottery winnings are not subject to personal income tax, so there are no tax consequences to consider in choosing a payment option. In France, Canada, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Finland, and the United Kingdom all prizes are immediately paid out as one lump sum, tax-free to the winner. In Liechtenstein, all winnings are tax-free and the winner may opt to receive a lump sum or an annuity with regard to the jackpot prizes.

In the US, federal courts have consistently held that lump sum payments received from third parties in exchange for the rights to lottery annuities are not capital assets for tax purpose. Rather, the lump sum is subject to ordinary income tax treatment.

Some people hire a third party to cash the lottery ticket for them. This can be done to avoid paying income taxes, hide the winnings from being seized for child support, or for money laundering of profits from illegal activity; some jurisdictions investigate overly frequent &quot;winners&quot; and may freeze payments to prevent these abuses.

In jurisdictions where public disclosure is required for winners to claim their prizes, some winners may hire an attorney to set up a blind trust for them so they can claim their prize and remain anonymous. This is done so that winners can avoid scams, jealousy, and other disadvantages that can come with winning a lottery jackpot.

== Outcomes for big winners ==
A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that people in Sweden who won large sums of money from the lottery tended to retain their wealth over a period of 10 years, often kept their jobs but took more vacation, and maintained or increased their happiness and mental health. The same study states that the common anecdote that &quot;70% of people who receive a large influx of money will lose it within a few years&quot; is false, and is falsely attributed to the National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE). NEFE released a statement disassociating themselves from the claim.

&quot;Time Magazine&quot; mentions a &quot;curse of the lottery&quot;. Financial consultant Don McNay provides anecdotes supporting this claim in his book, &quot;Life Lessons from the Lottery&quot;.

<text>Dick Higgins (15 March 1938 – 25 October 1998) was an American artist, composer, art theorist, poet, publisher, printmaker, and a co-founder of the Fluxus international artistic movement (and community). Inspired by John Cage, Higgins was an early pioneer of electronic correspondence. Higgins coined the word intermedia to describe his artistic activities, defining it in a 1965 essay by the same name, published in the first number of the &quot;Something Else Newsletter&quot;. His most notable audio contributions include &quot;Danger Music&quot; scores and the &quot;Intermedia&quot; concept to describe the ineffable inter-disciplinary activities that became prevalent in the 1960s.

==Life==
Dick Higgins was the son of Carter Chapin Higgins and Katherine Huntington Bigelow. He was born in Cambridge, England in 1938 into a rather rich family, due to his father owning Worcester Pressed Steel in Worcester, Massachusetts. He grew up with a brother and sister, Mark and Lisa. His younger brother Mark Huntington Higgins was murdered in the Congo in 1960.

As a boy, Higgins grew up and was educated in private boarding schools around the New England area, including Worcester, Massachusetts; Putney, Vermont; and Concord, New Hampshire. When he got older, he spent a lot of time in school; he attended Yale University, Columbia University (1960), Manhattan School of Printing, and the New School. He trained under many influential artists of this time, such as John Cage and Henry Cowell. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Columbia, and participated in John Cage&#x27;s monumental music composition course at the New School.

In 1960, he wed Alison Knowles, a fellow artist, and four years later, they had their daughters, Hannah Higgins and Jessica Higgins. They both grew up to continue the family Fluxus dynasty. One daughter of Higgins and Knowles, Hannah Higgins, is the author of &quot;Fluxus Experience&quot;, an authoritative volume about the Fluxus movement. Her twin sister, Jessica, is a New York based intermedia artist closely associated with seminal curator Lance Fung. Higgins and Knowles divorced in 1970 after 10 years of marriage and remarried in 1984.

Higgins died of a heart attack while staying at a private home in Quebec City.

==Career==
Higgins heard the John Cage &quot;Twenty-five-year Retrospective Concert&quot; in May 1958, and began studying with him that summer. Higgins and Alison Knowles both took part in the Wiesbaden, Germany &quot;Fluxus&quot; festival in 1962, that marked the founding of Fluxus activity. He founded Something Else Press in 1963, which published many important texts including Gertrude Stein, Bern Porter, Marshall McLuhan, Cage, Merce Cunningham, Cage&#x27;s teacher Henry Cowell, as well as his contemporaries such as artists Allan Kaprow, Al Hansen, Claes Oldenburg, and Ray Johnson as well as leading Fluxus members La Monte Young, George Brecht, Wolf Vostell, Daniel Spoerri, Emmett Williams, Eric Andersen, Ken Friedman, Ben Patterson, and others. The Something Else Press series of &quot;Great Bear Pamphlets,&quot; documented the earliest Fluxus performances.

He was an early and ardent proponent and user of computers as a tool for art making, dating back to the mid-1960s, when Alison Knowles and he created the first computer-generated literary texts. His &quot;A Book About Love &amp; War &amp; Death&quot;, a book-length aleatory poem published in 1972 included one of those. In his introduction, Higgins states, having finished the first three parts of the poem throwing dice, he wrote a FORTRAN IV program to produce part (or &quot;Canto&quot;) four. His work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde publication that experimented with language and meaning-making. Higgins also created &quot;metadrama&quot; poems that were &quot;minimal emotional statements or narratives&quot;. Between 1976 and 1994 he collaborated with the Italian writer and visual artist Luciano Caruso through email correspondence.

Higgins wrote and edited forty-seven books, including &quot;George Herbert&#x27;s Pattern Poems: In Their Tradition&quot; and &quot;On the Composition of Signs and Images&quot;, his edition of a Giordano Bruno text, which he annotated. He saw Bruno&#x27;s essay on the art of memory also as an early text on intermedia. &quot;A Dialectic of Centuries: Notes towards a Theory of the New Arts&quot; collected many of his essays and theoretical works in 1976. In 1972, Higgins founded Unpublished Editions (later renamed Printed Editions) to publish his short novel &quot;Amigo&quot;. In 2018, Siglio Press published a posthumous collection of Higgins&#x27;s writings titled &quot;Fluxus, Intermedia and the Something Else Press. Selected Writings by Dick Higgins&quot; edited by Steve Clay of Granary Books and Fluxus artist Ken Friedman.

<doc id="228596" wikidata="Q134885" url="?curid=228596" title="Flag of Thailand">
<text>The flag of Thailand (; , meaning &#x27;tricolour flag&#x27;) shows five horizontal stripes in the colours red, white, blue, white and red, with the central blue stripe being twice as wide as each of the other four. The design was adopted on 28 September 1917, according to the royal decree issued by Rama VI. Since 2016, that day is a national day of importance in Thailand celebrating the flag.

The colours are said to stand for nation-religion-king, an unofficial motto of Thailand, red for the land and people, white for religions and blue for the monarchy, the last having been the auspicious colour of Rama VI. As the king declared war on Germany that July, some note the flag now bore the same colours as those of the UK, France, Russia and the United States.

==Design==
The Flag Act of BE 2522 (1979) stipulates the design of the national flag as &quot;rectangular in shape with 6 part width and 9 part length, divided into five stripes throughout the length of the flag; with the middle stripe being 2 part wide, of deep blue colour, and the white stripes being 1 part wide next to each side of the deep blue stripes, and the red stripes being 1 part wide next to each side of the white stripes. The National Flag shall also be called the Tri-Rong flag&quot;.

===Colour standards===
The colours of the flag were standardised in an announcement of the Office of the Prime Minister dated 30 September 2017, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of its adoption. It gives recommended values for determining the standard colours of physical cloth flags, defined in the CIELAB colour space under Illuminant D65. RGB, HEX and CMYK values are derived by NSTDA.

===Construction Sheet===
== History ==

The first flag used for Siam was probably a plain red one, first used under Narai (1656–1688). Naval flags later used different symbols on the red ground—a white chakra, or the Hindu mythological elephant Airavata inside the chakra.

Officially the first flag was created in 1855 by Mongkut (Rama IV), showing a white elephant on red ground, as the plain coloured flag was not distinct enough for international relations.

In 1916 the flag was changed to show a white elephant in royal regalia. In 1916, the current design, but with the middle colour being the same red as the outer stripe, was defined as the civil ensign. According to a popular legend, king Vajiravudh (Rama VI) was appalled when he saw the elephant flag flown upside down by one of his subjects by accident, which caused him to order the creation of a vertically symmetrical design. Initially (1916/17), this was a purely red and white design of five horizontal stripes. Later in 1917, the middle colour was changed to dark blue, which was similar in tone to indigo or purple, which at the time was regarded as the auspicious colour for Saturday, the day Vajiravudh was born. According to other sources, the blue was also chosen to show solidarity with the Allies of World War I, which also had the colours blue-red-white in their flags.

===Timeline===
== Maritime flags ==

The naval ensign of the Royal Thai Navy (RTN) is the national flag with a red circle in the middle that reaches as far as the red stripes at the top and bottom. In the circle stands a white elephant, in full caparison, facing the hoist. The kingdom&#x27;s naval jack is the national flag defaced with the emblem of the Royal Thai Navy in the middle. The regimental colours of the RTN is as same as this flag; both ensigns were adopted in 1917.

:Irreducible orientable closed (i.e., compact and without boundary) 3-manifolds have a unique (up to isotopy) minimal collection of disjointly embedded incompressible tori such that each component of the 3-manifold obtained by cutting along the tori is either atoroidal or Seifert-fibered.

The acronym JSJ is for William Jaco, Peter Shalen, and Klaus Johannson. The first two worked together, and the third worked independently.

==The characteristic submanifold==

An alternative version of the JSJ decomposition states:
:A closed irreducible orientable 3-manifold &quot;M&quot; has a submanifold Σ that is a Seifert manifold (possibly disconnected and with boundary) whose complement is atoroidal (and possibly disconnected).

The submanifold Σ with the smallest number of boundary tori is called the characteristic submanifold of &quot;M&quot;; it is unique (up to isotopy). Cutting the manifold along the tori bounding the characteristic submanifold is also sometimes called a JSJ decomposition, though it may have more tori than the standard JSJ decomposition.

The boundary of the characteristic submanifold Σ is a union of tori that are almost the same as the tori appearing in the JSJ decomposition. However there is a subtle difference: if one of the tori in the JSJ decomposition is &quot;non-separating&quot;, then the boundary of the characteristic submanifold has two parallel copies of it (and the region between them is a Seifert manifold isomorphic to the product of a torus and a unit interval).
The set of tori bounding the characteristic submanifold can be characterised as the unique (up to isotopy) minimal collection of disjointly embedded incompressible tori such that &quot;closure&quot; of each component of the 3-manifold obtained by cutting along the tori is either atoroidal or Seifert-fibered.

The JSJ decomposition is not quite the same as the decomposition in the geometrization conjecture, because some of the pieces in the JSJ decomposition might not have finite volume geometric structures. For example, the mapping torus of an Anosov map of a torus has a finite volume sol structure, but its JSJ decomposition cuts it open along one torus to produce a product of a torus and a unit interval, and the interior of this has no finite volume geometric structure.

<text>Washington State University (WSU, or colloquially Wazzu) is a public land-grant research university in Pullman, Washington, United States. Founded in 1890, WSU is also one of the oldest land-grant universities in the American West. With an undergraduate enrollment of 24,278 and a total enrollment of 28,581, it is the second largest institution for higher education in Washington state behind the University of Washington. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

The WSU Pullman campus stands on a hill and is characterized by open spaces and a red brick and basalt material palette—materials originally found on site. The university sits within the rolling topography of the Palouse in rural eastern Washington and remains closely connected to the town and the region. The university also operates campuses across Washington at WSU Spokane, WSU Tri-Cities, and WSU Vancouver, all founded in 1989. In 2012, WSU launched an Internet-based Global Campus, which includes its online degree program, WSU Online. In 2015, WSU expanded to a sixth campus at WSU Everett. These campuses award primarily bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. Freshmen and sophomores were first admitted to the Vancouver campus in 2006 and to the Tri-Cities campus in 2007.

WSU&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Cougars and the school colors are crimson and gray. Six men&#x27;s and nine women&#x27;s varsity teams compete in NCAA Division I in the Pac-12 Conference. Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track teams compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.

==History==
===Agricultural College, Experiment Station, and School of Science===
In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act of 1862 into law, allowing for the creation of land-grant colleges “to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts ...in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes.&quot; The Hatch Act of 1887 expanded on the Morrill Act, providing federal funds for the establishment of agriculture experiment stations at land-grant colleges. Shortly after attaining statehood on November 11, 1889, the Washington State Legislature began taking steps to claim a land-grant college, and fewer than five months later on March 28, 1890, passed House Bill 90 for the creation of the &quot;Agricultural College, Experiment Station and School of Science of the State of Washington&quot;. Governor Elisha P. Ferry signed the bill into law a few days later. Soon after, a second act of legislature expanded the school&#x27;s educational mission to include general arts and sciences. The university and the experiment station would aid enterprise by improving farm management, conducting research, and teaching the skills needed to be better farmers. WSU&#x27;s role as a statewide institution became clear in 1894 with the launch of its first agricultural experiment station west of the Cascade Mountains near Puyallup.

According to the legislation, the site of the land-grant college was to be determined by a three-member committee appointed by the governor, but it stipulated that the site must be located in the southeast corner of the state. After an exhaustive examination of bidding towns such as Yakima and other towns in the Palouse region, the state&#x27;s new land-grant college opened to 59 students in Pullman on January 13, 1892, offering three major courses of study: agriculture, engineering, and domestic science. Pullman was possibly selected because of a generous land gift by the city and its railroad connections to Spokane and Portland, Oregon. A five-member Board of Regents was appointed with George W. Lilley acting as the school&#x27;s first President.

The school started out with a faculty of five, with a student-body largely consisting of children from the surrounding community, who, if they were residents of Washington would have attended tuition-free. The year 1897 saw the first graduating class of seven men and women.

====The Bryan years====
Enoch Albert Bryan, appointed July 22, 1893, and serving for 22 years, was the first influential president of WSU and considered by many as the true founder of the university. Bryan previously served as the president of Vincennes University in Indiana and was an alumnus of Indiana University and held a graduate degree from Harvard. When Bryan learned he was nominated for the presidency by a friend in Oregon, he had never even heard of the college. Before Bryan&#x27;s arrival, the fledgling university suffered through significant organizational instability. Under Bryan&#x27;s term as president, the curriculum included both a practical and liberal arts component, where chemistry, mathematics as well as history, English literature and two foreign languages were core courses, required for graduation regardless of major. Under Bryan, music and art held importance too, in 1905 he gained the approval of the Board of Regents for a School of Music. During this time, a committee approved the decision to change the school colors of blue and pink to the crimson and gray we see today. Bryan guided the college toward respectability and is arguably the most influential figure in the university&#x27;s history. The landmark clock tower in the center of campus is his namesake. As the college approached the end of its first decade of existence, Bryan and others tried to garner the necessary support to change the name of the school, which resulted in the introduction of a bill to change the school name to “Washington State College” in 1899. This and similar efforts in 1901 and 1903 were defeated with strong opposition for attempting to create another state university which would undermine the clout of the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle. However, in 1905 the school was finally able to officially change its name to the “State College of Washington” or more informally as &quot;Washington State College&quot; (WSC).

===Washington State College===
Ernest O. Holland succeeded Enoch Bryan as President of the Washington State College in 1915. That same year, a close friend of his whom he shared a room with while studying at Columbia University, Henry Suzzallo, became the President of the University of Washington. Holland&#x27;s early years as president and friendship with Suzzallo were challenged during his tenure as president. In 1909, the institutional rivalry between WSC and UW worsened when state legislators, the majority of which held seats in western Washington, were dismayed to find a foreign language department, an English Department headed by a Harvard-educated PhD, a school of architecture, and many departments with graduate students. The legislative committee promptly advised demoting the college to “trade school” status, an idea which Suzzallo supported. Suzzallo penned a letter to Holland promising to make WSC “the greatest school of agriculture in the world” only if Holland agreed to abandon all other disciplines to UW; Suzzallo&#x27;s proposal specifically sought to shut down WSC&#x27;s schools of architecture and pharmacy. After years of wrangling, the Washington legislature decided against limiting the academic mission and scope of WSC. The two presidents and their respective institutions continued to have a row over curriculum and state appropriations until Suzzallo was relieved of his position in 1926 due to the influence of Washington governor, Roland H. Hartley. In trying to outdo his former peer at UW, Holland wanted to build a library that rivaled the grandness of the newly built library at UW that bears Suzzallo&#x27;s name. Funding for the Holland Library was delayed by the state however until 1950.

Budgetary woes hit WSC in the Great Depression years starting in the 1930s. The budget, faculty, salaries, and enrollment slumped dramatically. Enrollment didn&#x27;t reach pre-Depression levels until 1936 and salaries until 1937 in nominal terms. With the start of World War II, the Washington State College was contracted by the War Department to house and train the Army Signal Corps where they were given pre-flight school training and lessons in Japanese language. The college hosted as many as 1,900 military personnel in the vacated dormitories and fraternities. It was during this time in 1944 however, when WSC saw the exciting introduction of the Cougar Gold brand of sharp white cheddar cheese from the campus creamery. The cheese was developed and gets its namesake from dairy bacteriologist Dr. N.S. Golding who was studying molds for cheese production. After the war ended and the passing of the G.I. Bill, the college went from having virtually no men on campus to being inundated with them. The school had to scramble to accommodate the former servicemen by buying migrant housing and using temporary housing units provided by the federal government. The campus became so crowded, that President Wilson Compton mulled over moving the college to Spokane, but, in 1947, he ultimately determined that it would be impractical.

===Washington State University===

On September 1, 1959, the state legislature passed a bill unopposed that officially changed the name to &quot;Washington State University&quot;. The maturing university partly owed the success of this to the establishment of the WSU Honors College, which is one of the oldest in the nation and a highly respected university program for gifted students. The university joined the Athletic Association of Western Universities in 1962, which included the University of Washington, and four other universities in California at the time. In an effort to improve the graduate program and research credentials of WSU, a low-grade nuclear reactor was constructed, funded by Atomic Energy Commission grants, and new doctoral programs were introduced.

By the 1970s, WSU&#x27;s enrollment quadrupled from its level in the 1940s to 14,000 students with an influx from the Baby Boom Generation. President Glenn Terrell took steps to increase funding for undergraduate and graduate education amid the nationwide recession of the mid-1970s. Terrell didn&#x27;t make any major cuts to the athletics department however, which didn&#x27;t go unnoticed and was a cause for anger about his leadership among some of the faculty.

====State-wide university====
Beginning with the start of Samuel H. Smith’s term as president in 1985, marked a large period of growth for WSU. In 1989, WSU gained branch campuses in Spokane, the Tri-Cities, and Vancouver with established extension offices and research centers in all regions of the state, with facilities in Prosser and Wenatchee. Smith proved to be a consummate fundraiser, with about $760 million raised during his term, thanks in some part to Microsoft co-founder and alumnus Paul Allen. In the 1990s Smith began to clamp down and take action regarding student alcohol abuse and disciplinary issues after some high-profile incidents on campus in an effort to improve the university&#x27;s image. The efforts seemed to have paid off when WSU lost its rank and was completely excluded from &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;’s party school list in August 2000. Improving the quality of education was the defining goal of the university under V. Lane Rawlins, who raised admission requirements and sought to improve the academic profile of the school with improved curricula and research facilities. After Rawlins retired in 2006, Elson Floyd succeeded him as president. Under Floyd&#x27;s leadership, increasing the diversity of the student body and continuing to raise the stature and reach of the university were a focus. In his eight years as president, WSU enrollment figures went up by 17 percent, including a 12.5 percent increase in the number of students of color, the amount of research grants awarded to WSU tripled to $600 million a year, and he led expansions in all of WSU&#x27;s branch campuses-most notably successfully campaigning for the creation of the public medical school that now bears his name at WSU - Spokane, the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine. The second public medical school in Washington, and only one of three in the state, is seen as key to the university&#x27;s organizational mission as a state land-grant university and its ambitions as a research university. Created five years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2015, the medical school&#x27;s goal is to alleviate a physician shortage in rural and eastern Washington using a community-based approach. The med school is said to be a key component in the university&#x27;s new research-focused $1.5 billion &quot;Drive to 25&quot; campaign under President Kirk Schulz, which seeks to make WSU among the nations top 25 public research universities by 2030. The Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine achieved full accreditation in June 2021.

==Campus==

The Pullman campus of Washington State University is and is in the Palouse region. The average elevation of the campus is approximately above sea level, and is west of the Idaho border and Moscow, home of the University of Idaho, also a land-grant institution. The university communities are connected by Highway 270 and the Bill Chipman Palouse Trail.

The Palouse is defined by its unique rolling hills that were created by wind-blown soil, which supports one of the world&#x27;s most productive dry-land agricultural regions. The main crops are wheat, peas, barley, and lentils. Evenings are often highlighted by a spectacular blue-pink sunset, which the first Board of Regents decided to use as the college&#x27;s colors (later changed to the current crimson and gray colors). Perched atop College Hill (one of the four main hills in Pullman), the campus overlooks downtown Pullman.

===Built environment===

Campus architecture is diverse, but its prevailing image is perhaps best characterized by a handful of red-brick buildings in the older campus core designed in a neo-Georgian or Renaissance Revival mode, many of which were constructed between the world wars. Yet WSU was hardly immune to modernist, &quot;international style&quot; trends of the post-World War II period, and features some notable examples of the type, particularly the Regents Hill dormitory complex, designed by Paul Thiry, on the north side of campus. By the 1990s, the university began to encourage eye-catching designs, including a 1994 addition to the old Holland Library (now called Terrell Library), by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership (now ZGF Architects LLP) with a curving sweep of windows and a cone-shaped skylight above its atrium; an amenity-filled recreation center with a massive Jacuzzi and fireplace in 2001; and the Samuel H. Smith Center for Undergraduate Education, or &quot;CUE,&quot; named for WSU president Smith, who served from 1985 to 2000. The latter two buildings were designed by Yost Grube Hall of Portland.

The busiest part of campus is the Glenn Terrell Friendship Mall, referred to as &quot;the mall&quot; by students. This walkway, which prior to the 1970s was a road with parking available along the sides, was named after Terrell, WSU&#x27;s president from 1967 to 1985. His secretary was known to set meetings ten minutes behind schedule to make up for the time he would spend talking to students along the way. The library complex (Terrell and Holland Libraries), the student union (Compton Union Building), and three academic buildings surround the mall. The new crimson-colored cube that distinguishes the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art opened in the spring of 2018, just across from the club seating entrance to the football stadium.

The football venue, Martin Stadium, named after Governor Clarence D. Martin, also figures prominently on campus. It is situated near the geographical center of the campus with the south grandstands built into the Hill (the Information Technology building is part of the south grandstands), and Terrell Library and the Vogel Plant BioSciences buildings overlooking the west and east ends, respectively. Football has been played here since 1895, first as Soldier Field, later renamed Rogers Field, rebuilt in 1936. After a fire to the main wooden grandstand in 1970, it was replaced with Martin Stadium, which opened in 1972. Even though it is the smallest in the Pac-12, it offers the most seating to students in the conference. After the 2006 season, Martin Stadium went under a massive renovation to expand the seating capacity and offer greater amenities for players and spectators, as well as made improvements to the general facilities such as bathrooms and concession stands. The Cougar Football Project is the proposed renovation of Martin Stadium that consists of two separate projects. The first project, called the Southside Project, would replace the old press box on the south stands with a new structure that includes a new press box, club seats, loge boxes, luxury suites and a club room. The Southside Project is now finished and was completed in November 2012. The second project, originally called the &quot;West End-Zone Project&quot; and now the Football Operations Building, provides a home for the Cougar football program, and includes new weight, locker, equipment. and training rooms for players, in addition to meeting rooms and coaches&#x27; offices. It also features a WSU Football heritage area along the west side and a game-day home for Gray W former letter winners.

Other notable buildings include Thompson Hall (1895), Stevens Hall (1896), the Math Learning Annex (1908), and Bryan Hall (1909), the university&#x27;s oldest surviving buildings which help enclose a sloping quadrangle featuring the &quot;Lowell Elm,&quot; a large American Elm (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;) brought from Elmwood in 1893 by Harriet Bryan, wife of newly appointed president Bryan. Thompson Hall, with its distinctive turrets and its resemblance to a chateau in the Loire Valley of France, was the original administration building, and &quot;Administration Building&quot; is still carved above the original west-facing entrance. Today, Thompson Hall is home to the foreign language department and also provides the administrative offices for the College of Arts and Sciences. Bryan Hall is perhaps the most noticeable building on campus, with its tall four-sided tower enclosing a carillon and displaying a clock that lights up neon-red in the evening. Stevens Hall, to Bryan Hall&#x27;s northwest, is reputed to be the oldest surviving all-women&#x27;s dormitory west of the Mississippi. Stevens Hall and Thompson Hall are on the National Register of Historic Places, and both were designed by the Seattle firm of Stephen &amp; Josenhans.

Also significant are the Lewis Alumni Centre and the Webster Physical Science Building. The alumni center is an old beef cattle barn dating from the 1920s that was thoroughly transformed in the 1980s into event space and offices for the WSU Alumni Association. Rooms in the alumni center include the Board of Regents&#x27; Boardroom, Lighty Library, the Athletics Hall of Fame, the Alumni Presidents&#x27; Room, and the &quot;Great Hall&quot; for large social events on the second floor. Webster Hall, completed in 1974 and designed by the Seattle-based architectural firm of Naramore, Bain, Brady, and Johanson (NBBJ) is the tallest building on campus with twelve above-ground floors of offices and an expansive view of the region from a lounge on the northwest side of the top floor.

From 1911 to 1923, Rudolph Weaver was the first chairman of the architecture department. He designed seven buildings on the WSU campus, including:
* Beef Barn, now the Lewis Alumni Centre, 1922
* Carpenter Hall, which was not finished until 1927.
* Community Hall. 1921
* McCroskey Hall, 1920

* President&#x27;s House, 1912.
* Stimson Hall, 1922
* Wilson-Short Hall, 1917, first used, but not finished until later.
===Residential campus===

WSU is a residential campus. Many freshmen live in residence halls, while some live in fraternity and sorority houses or in off-campus housing. After their first year, many students move to apartments, several owned by WSU. Most apartments are less than from campus. Off-campus housing is popularly divided into two sections that are commonly known by students as College Hill and &quot;Apartment Land.&quot; College Hill houses many members of the Greek community who no longer live-in their fraternity/sorority houses, and are commonly known as &quot;live-outs&quot;.

===Residence halls===
A number of the residence halls are co-ed, but there are single-gender living environments as well as a variety of other living options that include age-restricted housing, a mix of domestic and international students, and a global learning community. All of the residence halls, except for McEachern, are part of the RHA (Residence Hall Association).

Residence halls on campus include:
*The Hill Halls: Community/Duncan-Dunn, Elmina White Honors Hall, McCroskey, Wilmer-Davis and Stevens
*The Northside Halls: Regents Hill, Scott/Coman, Streit-Perham, Northside, and Global Scholars 
*Southside Halls: Stimson, Waller, Gannon-Goldsworthy, Rogers, Orton, McEachern, and Olympia
*The Stephenson Residential Complex: Stephenson East, Stephenson North and Stephenson South

Each hall has its own government which organizes events, manages its budget, and acts as a forum for student involvement. These halls range in size from the exclusive Stevens Hall (approximately 70 residents), to the massive Stephenson Complex (approximately 1200 residents total). The highlight of the year for the residence halls is often Homecoming Week when the residence halls, off-campus students, and Greeks compete in various events. Events such as the chariot race determine the winner of Homecoming Week. In the past decade, the winner of Homecoming Week has most often been a residence hall team.

===Greek life===
There are currently 27 fraternities in the Interfraternity Council, 14 sororities in the Panhellenic Council, 14 fraternities and sororities in the United Greek Association, and 10 fraternities and sororities in the National Panhellenic Council at Washington State University. There are 26 primarily residential fraternities and 14 primary residential sororities that are located on College Hill. Kappa Sigma is the oldest national fraternity at WSU with a founding date in 1909 and Alpha Delta Pi was the first sorority at WSU with a founding date in 1912. The average chapter size of the community organizations is 64 members. Between 25 and 30 percent of undergraduate students are in the Greek community annually. Greek affiliates have the highest GPA on WSU&#x27;s campus, averaging 3.2 for sorority women and 2.97 for fraternity men based on figures from Spring 2018. Individuals join chapters by going through recruitment, often a week at the beginning of one or both semesters where chapter members hold events to meet potential new members. Washington State University has a zero tolerance policy on hazing both potential new members and current members. Each year Greek chapters submit 6 Pillars of Excellence, each pillar representing a value of Greek Life at WSU, and do reports at the end of the year as a self-evaluation for each chapter. Washington State University &quot;recognizes the right of each fraternity and sorority to create policies and regulations of internal governance, as long as said policies do not conflict with those described in this document or any of its appendices.&quot;

===College Hill===
Greek Row is situated on College Hill just downhill from Bryan Hall and the Hill Halls (the historic single-gender dormitories) on the WSU campus, and among the homes of faculty, Greek live-outs, and apartment buildings. The Greek Row and College Hill area is a diverse community of students, faculty members, and families. College Hill is also home to the President of WSU, Kirk Schulz. College Hill is supported by The College Hill Association, whose mission envisions a vibrant, diverse, and improving community that welcomes all residents and values the historic character of the neighborhood. Restaurants, thrift stores and various bars line Colorado Street, the main street on College Hill. The bars on College Hill include Cougar Cottage (informally, the Coug), currently in its 90th year of operation, Valhalla (informally, V-Hall), and The Emporium; all boast a large number of customers on the weekends as well as many themed weekdays.

===Recreation and the outdoors===
The university has the Student Recreation Center (SRC), which was the largest student recreation center in the United States when it was opened in 2001. The SRC contains a elevated indoor track, four basketball courts, two volleyball courts, roller hockey rink, four racquetball courts, swimming pool, 50-person Jacuzzi, free weights, weight machines, cardio equipment, exercise instruction rooms, outdoor sand volleyball courts, and a low to high ropes course. The campus also has several other basketball courts, dance rooms, a climbing wall, and the Outdoor Recreation Center where students can check out equipment or register for various events and trips. The Bill Chipman Palouse Trail links Pullman with Moscow and links to the Latah Trail to Troy, from WSU. Another bike trail wraps around the Pullman campus (about long). The school has an intramural program, and club sports are also very popular on campus. The university also has The Chinook, a 69,000 square foot space designed for students. It features fitness facilities, study spaces, social spaces for events, and Freshens Fresh Food Studio.

The campus added a championship golf course in 2008; Palouse Ridge, a $12.3 million project, opened on August 29. It intends to improve the school&#x27;s golf teams, provide a laboratory for students in turf grass courses, and give boosters and alumni a new reason to visit the campus. From the back tees (Crimson), the course rating is 75.9 with a slope rating of 140. It replaces a sub-standard 9-hole course that was built in 1923 and was mostly unimproved. It closed in 2006 for the redesign to create Palouse Ridge, on the same site and adjacent land. The UI Golf Course in Moscow also offers student rates. It opened in 1937 and added its second nine in 1970; the back tees are at , with a course rating of 72.4 and a slope rating of 135.

Within , many students have the option to hike at Kamiak Butte and Steptoe Butte. Moscow Mountain, at in the Palouse Range in Idaho, provides opportunities for hiking and mountain biking. For aquatic adventures, students can cliff jump or boat at the Snake River. Farther out, white-river rafting, downhill skiing, and hiking in the nearby foothills of the Rocky Mountains are available. WSU formerly operated its own alpine ski area in Idaho, the North-South Ski Bowl, which was sold in the early 1980s.

===Arboretum and Botanical Garden===
The WSU Arboretum Committee continues to develop an Arboretum and Botanical Garden on a hilltop adjacent to the Lewis Alumni Center. In addition, about on the east edge of campus has been identified for a more expansive Arboretum and Botanical Garden, including a wildlife center. Students interested in contributing to the development of the WSU Arboretum are working with the Native Plant &amp; Landscape Restoration Nursery to help establish tree plantings, future habitat restoration sites, or native plant displays that may be part of a campus green belt design.

===Environmental record and sustainability initiatives===

====Energy use on campus====

WSU has one LEED-silver certified building on campus, and two more buildings that meet LEED-silver standards but are not certified. The university has also encouraged the use of energy efficient lighting, energy management systems, and insulating steam lines, to reduce wasted power.

====Energy profile====

WSU&#x27;s energy is generated in part by an on-campus steam plant, powered by natural gas with diesel fuel back-up. This accounts for 38% of carbon emissions, or 53,922 metric tonnes e out of 136,166 metric tons total. The remaining carbon emissions is predominantly the result of purchased electricity (52%), with less than 10% the result of commuting, air travel, refrigerant leaks, and waste incineration. The university has committed to lowering carbon emissions 36% below 2005 levels by 2035, though thus far emission levels have remained relatively flat.

WSU is active in clean energy research, though the campus does not currently have any renewable energy installations.

====Energy investments====

WSU does not currently commit to establishing a committee or policy that supports climate and sustainability shareholder proposals at companies where the endowment funds are invested. The university is exploring investing in renewable energy, but otherwise is focused on optimizing investment returns. Proxy voting is not possible due to the fact the endowment fund is entirely invested in comingled investment vehicles.

====Sustainability====

The university promotes on-campus sustainability primarily though the Sustainability and Environment Committee and the ASWSU Environmental Task Force. Undergraduates who have an idea to improve campus sustainability can apply for funding from the Cougar Green Fund, which is funded by an optional $5 student fee. WSU also provides a free bikeshare system through its Greenbike program.

===Museums and collections===

The Museum of Art/WSU has several permanent collections, including the Ernest O. Holland Collection given by the university&#x27;s fourth president and the Charles Orton Collection, given by a former regent. Others are the Goya and Daumier Collections, Chaplin Woodcuts, Consortium Collections, Meyer Shapiro Print Collection, Elwood Collection and Marian E. Smith Collection of Northwest glass art. Other permanent collections contain works by Northwest artists D. Griffin, Mark Tobey, Kenneth Callahan, Margaret Tomkins, and former faculty members from WSU and the University of Washington.

The university also has an extensive collection of outdoor art on its Pullman campus. Pieces range from a life-size bronze book-figure &quot;Bookin by Terry Allen to &quot;Palouse Columns&quot; (2003) by Robert Maki to &quot;The Technicolor Heart,&quot; a fourteen-foot painted bronze work by Jim Dine. A large part of WSU&#x27;s public art collection is made possible by the percent-for-art Art in Public Places program of the Washington State Arts Commission.

Beginning in 2005 the Museum of Art began organizing its own traveling exhibitions. These exhibitions, including works by Roy Lichtenstein, Gaylen Hansen, and Chris Jordan, have been seen across the country. Between 2005 and 2011, exhibitions organized by the Museum of Art will have traveled to 20 museums in 11 states, and will have been seen by more than 300,000 people. The Museum has also published 6 trade books since 2004. The Museum of Art&#x27;s latest exhibition publication, &quot;Running the Numbers, an American self-portrait&quot;, features essays by Chris Bruce, Paul Hawken and Lucy R. Lippard.

Several other museums and collections are found on the WSU Pullman campus. One of the largest is the Charles R. Conner Museum of Natural History, exhibiting more than 700 mounts of birds and mammals, and possessing more than 65,000 research specimens. The Connor Museum has its roots in an 1894 gift of the state of Washington&#x27;s exhibits from the Chicago&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fair, encouraged by then President of the Board of Regents Charles R. Conner. Located on the first floor of Abelson Hall, the museum is open 8 a.m.–5 p.m. daily except major holidays.

The Museum of Anthropology, with archaeological and ethnographic collections, also draws visitors. Open 9 a.m.–4 p.m. Monday through Friday during the school year, the museum has varied exhibits and special events. It also has a collection of objects representing the culture of Native American tribes in the Inland Northwest, and is an official repository for archaeological collections from Eastern Washington.

Also at WSU are the Harold E. Culver Collection, with fossils of pre-historic animals; the Lyle and Lela Jacklin Collection of Silicified Wood &amp; Minerals; and S. Elroy McCaw Fluorescent Mineral Display. Research collections include an Historic Costume and Textiles Collection, the Maurice T. James Entomological Collection, the Marion Ownbey Herbarium, the Mycological Herbarium, and the Henry W. Smith Soil Monolith Collection.

===WSU Libraries===
The WSU Libraries coordinate the administration of three major libraries on the WSU Pullman campus ( Holland/Terrell, and Owen Science &amp; Engineering Libraries) and three libraries off the Pullman campus (WSU Health Sciences library, and the WSU Tri-Cities and WSU Vancouver libraries).

The WSU Libraries also participates in the Orbis Cascade Alliance, a consortium of 38 university and college libraries in Washington and Oregon offering the Summit catalog and an inter-library loan system. The WSU Libraries participates in the Greater Western Library Alliance (GWLA), a consortium of 39 research libraries in the central and western United States. WSU Libraries uses ILLiad, RAPID, Rapido (Ex Libris), and DOCLINE for document delivery. The WSU Libraries is a member of the Association of Research Libraries.

WSU Libraries employs faculty librarians and paraprofessional staff, in addition to student workers.

The WSU Libraries holds 2,266,616 print volumes and WSU faculty and students downloaded 2,022,603 from its licensed online collections in 2012.

===Research===
According to the National Science Foundation, WSU spent $360 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 71st in the nation.

Research and scholarship at WSU is rooted in agriculture, natural for a land-grant university. The institution&#x27;s first leader, George W. Lilley (1891–1892), was both president of the then-named Washington Agricultural College and School of Science and director of the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station. Subjects taught by the first five faculty members included agriculture, botany, horticulture, forestry, and veterinary science.

In 1894, the sixth faculty member, William Jasper Spillman, arrived to teach plant science and mathematics and serve as the first wheat breeder. The WSU wheat research and breeding program continues to serve the Washington wheat industry, the sixth largest industry in the nation in 2008–2009. The state&#x27;s wheat growers work closely with WSU researchers on development of new wheat varieties that meet their needs.

The university&#x27;s food and agriculture research helps sustain the state&#x27;s annual $29 billion food industry. Faculty partnered with agriculture interests to create today&#x27;s $3 billion a year wine grape business. The Apple Genome Project draws collaboration from scientists worldwide to map the apple genome, research aimed at supporting the apple industry.

Food science is another long-time research field at WSU. Work in the 1940s on types of cheese suitable for storing in cans or tins led to creation of now award-winning Cougar Gold cheese, a white cheddar produced at the WSU Creamery with milk from the university&#x27;s dairy herd. In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of microwave energy for producing pre-packaged, low-acid foods, and WSU professor Juming Tang led development of the technology by university, industry and U.S. military scientists.

In terms of productivity, WSU plant sciences faculty rank No. 2 in the nation, animal sciences faculty rank fourth, and food science faculty rank sixth according to Academic Analytics&#x27; 2007 &quot;Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index&quot;. In addition, WSU agricultural studies have helped shape U.S. public policy by showing how sustainable farming practices sidestep the environmental hazards of conventional agriculture. The Climate Friendly Farming project helps farmers adopt methods that mitigate global climate change. Research in agriculture is a strength for WSU, where the university has led in research and development funding from the US Department of Agriculture.

Veterinary medicine and animal health are also important research areas at WSU. In 2008, a $25 million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation funded a large share of the cost for a research facility for a new WSU School for Global Animal Health. Its scientists address global infectious disease challenges by detecting diseases within animal populations and controlling their transmission. The Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at WSU works closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop and deploy diagnostic tests for livestock diseases.

In the area of clean technologies, university researchers work to raise the efficiency and reliability of the nation&#x27;s electrical power grid, improve air quality forecasting in the Northwest, and conduct cooperative research projects under the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI). Scholars are developing an algae-based biofuel that consumes greenhouse gases in its production and are working to patent nanospring technology that would fit into an ordinary gas tank, solving the problem of hydrogen storage. In 2001, WSU professor M. Grant Norton and University of Idaho physics professor David McIlroy were the first scientists to create nanosprings.

WSU is also home to one of the few remaining nuclear research reactors in the country. The Nuclear Radiation Center is a 1 MW TRIGA conversion reactor built in 1961 during President Eisenhower&#x27;s Atoms for Peace initiative. It is a very potent research tool utilized by WSU&#x27;s radiochemistry graduate program, as well as providing education on the nuclear industry to the public through talks and facility tours.

Other recent research highlights include studies of the effects of sleep and sleep loss on human cognitive functioning, work to advance shock compression science with contracts awarded to the WSU Institute for Shock Physics by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the department of energy, and a program funded by the National Science Foundation that trains doctoral students to analyze evolutionary processes. Reproductive biologist Patricia A. Hunt was named one of the top 50 researchers of 2007 by &quot;Scientific American&quot; for her work showing a potential threat to human health posed by bisphenol A (BPA), a component of the polycarbonate plastics used to make food and beverage containers.

Over the years, WSU research and scholarship included the 1968 discovery of the Marmes Man at the Marmes Rockshelter in southeastern Washington, the nation&#x27;s oldest human remains at that time; the development of high-yielding dwarf wheat; discovery of insect resistance to pesticides; and creation of a method to store cheese in tins, which led to the university&#x27;s well known and still produced Cougar Gold Cheese. WSU fruit breeders have developed many varieties for the state including, in 1952, the sweet, yellow Rainier cherry, and in 2010 an apple specifically for Washington, named Cosmic Crisp. 
The RosBREED project, funded by the USDA-NIFA Specialty Crop Research Initiative, enables the routine application of modern genomics and genetics technologies in U.S. rosaceous crop breeding programs, hosted at Mainlab Bioinformatics, Washington State University.

===Outreach and public service===
The WSU Extension has offices in each of Washington&#x27;s 39 counties, providing training and assistance in agricultural practices, natural resource management, human and life skills, diversity understanding and outreach, the state 4-H program, and many other programs. In 1973 in Seattle, WSU Extension founded the now national Master Gardener Programs of trained volunteers. WSU Extension faculty and staff have also provided assistance for programs in under-developed and developing countries. Many faculty members have appointments to do research, teach, and provide extension services.

The State of Washington&#x27;s network of Small Business Development Centers is a cooperative effort of Washington State University, other public educational institutions, economic development organizations and the US Small Business Administration. A source of counsel on starting and growing small firms, the centers are found in 17 locations in Western Washington and seven location in Eastern and Central Washington.

The WSU Creamery, an outreach and teaching program, has garnered a reputation for fine dairy products, most notably the Cougar Gold cheese sold at the creamery store, Ferdinand&#x27;s, as well as online and at some local Pullman stores. The cheese is regionally famous and fetches a starting price of $22 for a 30 oz can. &quot;Cougar Gold&quot; is marketed as &quot;a white, sharp cheddar with a taste that resembles Swiss or Gouda&quot; and is &quot;aged for at least one year.&quot; Cougar Cheese also comes in other varieties, including American Cheddar, Smoky Cheddar, Viking, Dill Garlic, Sweet Basil, Hot Pepper and Crimson Fire.

Washington State University Press each year publishes an average of eight titles that focus on the American West, with particular emphasis on the prehistory, history, environment, politics, and culture of the greater Northwest region. A member of the Association of University Presses, the WSU Press publishes in varied genres, including scholarly and trade monographs, reminiscences, essays, biographies and works that tell the story of the West in innovative ways.

Through the Center for Civic Engagement on the Pullman campus, students participate in an estimated 30,000 hours annually of credit and non-credit service activities in the community.

In 2008, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching granted WSU its Community Engagement elective classification, both for curricular engagement and for outreach and partnerships.

WSU operates a research extension out of Prosser, Washington. AgWeatherNet 
(AWN) provides access to current and historical weather data from Washington State University&#x27;s automated weather station network along with a range of models and decision aids. The weather data, advisories, weather data products and decision support systems provided by AgWeatherNet and WSU can help improve production and product quality, optimize resource use and reduce environmental impact.

==Student life==


Student life on WSU&#x27;s Pullman campus is influenced by a variety of student organizations and their committees. Open to all students, they create educational, entertaining and cultural programming for WSU students and the local community. Committees include Asian Pacific American Student Coalition (APASC), Black Student Union (BSU), Environmental Sustainability Alliance (ESA), Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA), International Students&#x27; Council (ISC), Ku Ah Mah, KZUU Radio, Middle Eastern Students Association (MESA), Movimiento Estudianti Chicano de Aztian (MEChA), Student Legal Services (SLS), Veteran&#x27;s Student Committee, and GIVE on the Pullman Campus. There are also more than 300 registered student organisations (RSOs) that cover many interests. All ASWSU committees are members of &quot;Committee Squared,&quot; the coalition of all ASWSU Committee leaders. ASWSU also consists of the President and Vice President who oversee the Executive Staff. The staff consists of a variety of directors and assistant directors advancing student causes via student life, diversity affairs, campus life, and others. The 23-member Senate represents students via academic colleges as well as the Honors College and Freshman class. The Senate meets weekly to debate legislation, hear reports from the Executive Staff, and appoint the various officers of ASWSU. The Senate also provides financial support to the nearly 400 registered student organizations on campus via the Senate Finance Committee. Finally, the Election Board and the Judicial Board complete the association.

There are several other influential student organizations. Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, the United Greek Council, and the National Pan-Hellenic Council are governmental bodies for university-recognized Greek social organizations. The Residence Hall Association is a government body for students in the residence halls, governing all of the residence halls on campus excluding McEachern and Stimson Halls. It is the second biggest registered student organization at Washington State, representing about 4,700 on-campus resident students.

The board of directors of the Students&#x27; Book Corporation has a total of nine directors. Five are students at WSU, two are faculty and two are administrative directors. These people oversees the non-profit campus bookstore separate from WSU. The Students&#x27; Book Corporation provides a 10% point of sale discount. On average the dividend total has been about $85,000. This is then received at ASWSU organizations at each campus to be distributed to various groups and activities. The Compton Union Board (CUB) oversees the management of the student union building and its services. The University Recreation Board oversees the management of university recreation. The Student Alumni Connection hosts several major campus events.

The Student Entertainment Board (SEB) is a student-led board composed of undergraduate students. Positions on the board include: Spotlight, Films, Up All Night, Lectures, CUB Gallery, Concerts, VPLAC (Visual, Performing, and Literary Arts Committee), Special Event (Homecoming and Springfest), associate director, and Director. They are responsible for bringing diverse arts &amp; entertainment to campus.

The Coalition for Women Students provides much of the multicultural programs on campus, including the annual minority women symposium, the Week Without Violence, and Take Back the Night rally and march. CWS is made up of Association for Pacific and Asian Women, Black Women&#x27;s Caucus, Mujeres Unidas, Native American Women&#x27;s Association, and the YWCA of WSU. The organization also funds the all-volunteer Women&#x27;s Transit, a safe door-to-door transportation program for women who would otherwise walk alone at night.

===Student government===
WSU has two representative student body organizations: the Associated Students of Washington State University (ASWSU) founded in 1915 and the Graduate and Professional Students Association (GPSA) founded about 1970.

In recent years, the student body completed several major projects on campus. In addition to passing a $15 transportation fee to increase Pullman Transit&#x27;s service, the student body also voted to remodel the Compton Union Building. The building closed in May 2006 and re-opened in August 2008. In March 2006, ASWSU voted to support the renovation of Martin Stadium, adding $25 per semester to undergraduate student fees.

====Associated Students of Washington State University====
ASWSU&#x27;s organizational framework is similar to that of most American governments complete with an appointed and confirmed judiciary, elected representatives (from districts) to a senate, and an annually elected president and vice-president team. The president also has a paid staff led by the chief of staff ranging in size from 6–12 members, depending on the year.

====Graduate and Professional Students Association====
GPSA is similar, but differs in that it lacks a judiciary or a paid staff. The GPSA is centered on the senate which is composed of a large number of senators that represent different graduate and professional programs. The GPSA also has an executive Council that consists of the (GPSA) President, vice-presidents, and nine District Representatives elected from the nine colleges of WSU.

===Media===

&quot;Washington State Magazine&quot; is the alumni and research magazine of Washington State University. Published quarterly, the magazine covers news and issues of interest to Washington State University faculty, staff, students, alumni, and the people of Washington. The magazine was first published in 2001. Before &quot;Washington State Magazine&quot;, WSU alumni news was published in &quot;HillTopics&quot; from 1969 to 2000, and &quot;The PowWow&quot;, the alumni magazine from 1910 to 1969. Research news at the university appeared in &quot;Universe&quot; magazine in the 1990s.

&quot;WSU News&quot; is the university&#x27;s official news website and daily e-newsletter for faculty, staff and graduate students.

&quot;The Daily Evergreen&quot; is Washington State University&#x27;s student newspaper. The first issue of the &quot;Evergreen&quot; was published in 1895.

WSU broadcast media include Northwest Public Radio and Television, the network of public radio and television stations in the Northwest owned and operated by Washington State University. NWPR&#x27;s flagship station—KWSU 1250 in Pullman—signed on December 10, 1922, as KFAE, became KWSC in 1925, and then KWSU in the 1960s. WSU alumnus Edward R. Murrow got his start in radio at KWSC.

Cable 8 Productions is a local student-operated cable TV channel serving WSU and the Pullman-Moscow area. KZUU 90.7 FM, a non-commercial college radio station, is a service of ASWSU. It gained FCC approval in 1979. KUGR Sports Rock is a student-operated, online radio station.
Among the students who operate these media are broadcasting students in WSU&#x27;s Edward R. Murrow College of Communication.

=== Song ===
&quot;The Fight Song&quot; is the school&#x27;s fight song. It was composed in 1919 by students Phyllis Sayles and lyrics were written by Zella Melcher, as a class project.

The lyrics are found on the Washington State University visitor website.

Additionally, Washington State has embraced Andy Grammer&#x27;s &quot;Back Home&quot; in recent years, featured prominently during sporting events and appearing on merchandise sold by the university.

==Athletics==

Washington State University is a member of the Pac-12 Conference. The school&#x27;s mascot is &quot;Butch T. Cougar&quot; and the school&#x27;s colors are crimson and gray. Varsity athletics include men&#x27;s baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, and track and field, as well as women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, golf, rowing, soccer, swimming, volleyball, tennis, and track and field. In the past WSU had varsity programs of boxing, wrestling, gymnastics, and men&#x27;s swimming. In 1917, WSU won its first national championship in men&#x27;s basketball. In 1937, Roy Petragallo and Ed McKinnon won the NCAA boxing championship, another national championship. The Cougars third and most recent national championship was earned in 1977 in indoor track and field.
University Recreation also supports 26 club sports, including bowling, men&#x27;s crew, cricket, cycling, equestrian show team, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s flag football, fencing, polo, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey, judo, men&#x27;s lacrosse, logger sports, rodeo, men&#x27;s rugby union, women&#x27;s rugby, sailing, ski team, men&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s fast-pitch softball, taekwondo, triathlon, Ultimate, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, water polo and wrestling.
Washington State&#x27;s biggest rival is the University of Washington Huskies. Strong rivalries also exist between WSU and the other Pac-12 teams of the Pacific Northwest: the University of Oregon Ducks and Oregon State University Beavers. WSU&#x27;s closest geographic rival is the University of Idaho Vandals, a fellow land-grant school only east of Pullman across the state line in Moscow. Conference rivals until 1959, their rivalry football game, the &quot;Battle of the Palouse&quot;, was played on an annual basis from 1901 until 1978 when the NCAA Division I split. After Idaho returned to Division I-A, a renewed series lasted a decade, from 1998 until 2007. The renewed series was dropped from the schedule due to the Cougars&#x27; continued dominance of the Vandals in the series, and each school&#x27;s ability to generate more revenue by playing other opponents. Vandal head coach Robb Akey, a former WSU defensive coordinator, preferred the game as an occasional rather regular attraction. On hiatus for five seasons, it returned for one year in 2013.

==Notable alumni and faculty==
The university has 196,257 living alumni in fall 2015, according to WSU Quick Facts.

Among the 39 WSU alumni to receive the Regents&#x27; Distinguished Alumnus Award since 1962 are recipient of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Irwin Rose (attended one year, graduated University of Chicago), broadcaster Edward R.

<text>In mathematics, an eigenfunction of a linear operator &quot;D&quot; defined on some function space is any non-zero function formula_1 in that space that, when acted upon by &quot;D&quot;, is only multiplied by some scaling factor called an eigenvalue. As an equation, this condition can be written as
formula_2
for some scalar eigenvalue formula_3 The solutions to this equation may also be subject to boundary conditions that limit the allowable eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

An eigenfunction is a type of eigenvector.

==Eigenfunctions==
In general, an eigenvector of a linear operator &quot;D&quot; defined on some vector space is a nonzero vector in the domain of &quot;D&quot; that, when &quot;D&quot; acts upon it, is simply scaled by some scalar value called an eigenvalue. In the special case where &quot;D&quot; is defined on a function space, the eigenvectors are referred to as eigenfunctions. That is, a function &quot;f&quot; is an eigenfunction of &quot;D&quot; if it satisfies the equation

where λ is a scalar. The solutions to Equation may also be subject to boundary conditions. Because of the boundary conditions, the possible values of λ are generally limited, for example to a discrete set &quot;λ&quot;1, &quot;λ&quot;2, … or to a continuous set over some range. The set of all possible eigenvalues of &quot;D&quot; is sometimes called its spectrum, which may be discrete, continuous, or a combination of both.

Each value of λ corresponds to one or more eigenfunctions. If multiple linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same eigenvalue, the eigenvalue is said to be degenerate and the maximum number of linearly independent eigenfunctions associated with the same eigenvalue is the eigenvalue&#x27;s &quot;degree of degeneracy&quot; or geometric multiplicity.

===Derivative example===
A widely used class of linear operators acting on infinite dimensional spaces are differential operators on the space C∞ of infinitely differentiable real or complex functions of a real or complex argument &quot;t&quot;. For example, consider the derivative operator formula_4 with eigenvalue equation
formula_5

This differential equation can be solved by multiplying both sides by formula_6 and integrating. Its solution, the exponential function
formula_7
is the eigenfunction of the derivative operator, where &quot;f&quot;0 is a parameter that depends on the boundary conditions. Note that in this case the eigenfunction is itself a function of its associated eigenvalue λ, which can take any real or complex value. In particular, note that for λ = 0 the eigenfunction &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a constant.

Suppose in the example that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is subject to the boundary conditions &quot;f&quot;(0) = 1 and formula_8. We then find that
formula_9
where λ = 2 is the only eigenvalue of the differential equation that also satisfies the boundary condition.

===Link to eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices===
Eigenfunctions can be expressed as column vectors and linear operators can be expressed as matrices, although they may have infinite dimensions. As a result, many of the concepts related to eigenvectors of matrices carry over to the study of eigenfunctions.

Define the inner product in the function space on which &quot;D&quot; is defined as
formula_10
integrated over some range of interest for &quot;t&quot; called Ω. The &quot;*&quot; denotes the complex conjugate.

Suppose the function space has an orthonormal basis given by the set of functions {&quot;u&quot;1(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;u&quot;2(&quot;t&quot;), …, &quot;u&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)}, where &quot;n&quot; may be infinite. For the orthonormal basis,
formula_11
where &quot;δ&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is the Kronecker delta and can be thought of as the elements of the identity matrix.

Functions can be written as a linear combination of the basis functions,
formula_12
for example through a Fourier expansion of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). The coefficients &quot;b&quot;&quot;j&quot; can be stacked into an &quot;n&quot; by 1 column vector . In some special cases, such as the coefficients of the Fourier series of a sinusoidal function, this column vector has finite dimension.

Additionally, define a matrix representation of the linear operator &quot;D&quot; with elements
formula_13

We can write the function &quot;Df&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) either as a linear combination of the basis functions or as &quot;D&quot; acting upon the expansion of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;),
formula_14

Taking the inner product of each side of this equation with an arbitrary basis function &quot;u&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;t&quot;),
formula_15

This is the matrix multiplication &quot;Ab&quot; = &quot;c&quot; written in summation notation and is a matrix equivalent of the operator &quot;D&quot; acting upon the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) expressed in the orthonormal basis. If &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is an eigenfunction of &quot;D&quot; with eigenvalue λ, then &quot;Ab&quot; = &quot;λb&quot;.

===Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of Hermitian operators===
Many of the operators encountered in physics are Hermitian. Suppose the linear operator &quot;D&quot; acts on a function space that is a Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis given by the set of functions {&quot;u&quot;1(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;u&quot;2(&quot;t&quot;), …, &quot;u&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)}, where &quot;n&quot; may be infinite. In this basis, the operator &quot;D&quot; has a matrix representation &quot;A&quot; with elements
formula_16
integrated over some range of interest for &quot;t&quot; denoted Ω.

By analogy with Hermitian matrices, &quot;D&quot; is a Hermitian operator if &quot;A&quot;&quot;ij&quot; = &quot;A&quot;&quot;ji&quot;*, or: formula_17

Consider the Hermitian operator &quot;D&quot; with eigenvalues &quot;λ&quot;1, &quot;λ&quot;2, … and corresponding eigenfunctions &quot;f&quot;1(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;f&quot;2(&quot;t&quot;), …. This Hermitian operator has the following properties:
* Its eigenvalues are real, &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;*
* Its eigenfunctions obey an orthogonality condition, formula_18 if &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot;

The second condition always holds for &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;λ&quot;&quot;j&quot;. For degenerate eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;, orthogonal eigenfunctions can always be chosen that span the eigenspace associated with &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;, for example by using the Gram-Schmidt process. Depending on whether the spectrum is discrete or continuous, the eigenfunctions can be normalized by setting the inner product of the eigenfunctions equal to either a Kronecker delta or a Dirac delta function, respectively.

For many Hermitian operators, notably Sturm–Liouville operators, a third property is
* Its eigenfunctions form a basis of the function space on which the operator is defined

As a consequence, in many important cases, the eigenfunctions of the Hermitian operator form an orthonormal basis. In these cases, an arbitrary function can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the Hermitian operator.

==Applications==
===Vibrating strings===

Let denote the transverse displacement of a stressed elastic chord, such as the vibrating strings of a string instrument, as a function of the position along the string and of time . Applying the laws of mechanics to infinitesimal portions of the string, the function satisfies the partial differential equation
formula_19
which is called the (one-dimensional) wave equation. Here is a constant speed that depends on the tension and mass of the string.

This problem is amenable to the method of separation of variables. If we assume that can be written as the product of the form , we can form a pair of ordinary differential equations:
formula_20

Each of these is an eigenvalue equation with eigenvalues formula_21 and , respectively. For any values of and , the equations are satisfied by the functions
formula_22
where the phase angles and are arbitrary real constants.

If we impose boundary conditions, for example that the ends of the string are fixed at and , namely , and that , we constrain the eigenvalues. For these boundary conditions, and , so the phase angles , and
formula_23

This last boundary condition constrains to take a value , where is any integer. Thus, the clamped string supports a family of standing waves of the form
formula_24

In the example of a string instrument, the frequency is the frequency of the -th harmonic, which is called the -th overtone.

===Schrödinger equation===
In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation
formula_25
with the Hamiltonian operator
formula_26
can be solved by separation of variables if the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time. In that case, the wave function leads to the two differential equations,
Both of these differential equations are eigenvalue equations with eigenvalue . As shown in an earlier example, the solution of Equation is the exponential
formula_27

Equation is the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian operator are stationary states of the quantum mechanical system, each with a corresponding energy . They represent allowable energy states of the system and may be constrained by boundary conditions.

The Hamiltonian operator is an example of a Hermitian operator whose eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis. When the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time, general solutions of the Schrödinger equation are linear combinations of the stationary states multiplied by the oscillatory , formula_28 or, for a system with a continuous spectrum,
formula_29

The success of the Schrödinger equation in explaining the spectral characteristics of hydrogen is considered one of the greatest triumphs of 20th century physics.

===Signals and systems===
In the study of signals and systems, an eigenfunction of a system is a signal that, when input into the system, produces a response , where is a complex scalar eigenvalue.

<doc id="228606" wikidata="Q1737734" url="?curid=228606" title="Keele University">
<text>Keele University is a public research university in Keele, approximately from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, England. Founded in 1949 as the University College of North Staffordshire, it was granted university status by Royal Charter as the University of Keele in 1962.

Keele occupies a rural campus close to the village of Keele and includes extensive woods, lakes and Keele Hall set in the Staffordshire Potteries. It has a science park and a conference centre, and is the largest campus university in the UK. The university&#x27;s Medical School operates the clinical part of its courses from a separate campus at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. The School of Nursing and Midwifery is based at the nearby Clinical Education Centre.

==History==
===Establishment===
Cambridge and Oxford extension lectures had been arranged in the Potteries since the 1890s, but outside any organised educational framework or establishment. In 1904, funds were raised by local industrialists to support teaching by the creation of a North Staffordshire College, but the project, without the backing of Staffordshire County Council, was abandoned.

By the late 1930s the Staffordshire towns of Longton, Fenton, Burslem, Hanley had grown into the largest conurbation in the UK without some form of university provision. A large area including Staffordshire, Shropshire and parts of Cheshire and Derbyshire did not have its own university. Stoke, in particular, demanded highly qualified graduates for the regional pottery and mining industries and also additional social workers, teachers and administrators. A. D. Lindsay, Professor of Philosophy and Master of Balliol College, Oxford, was a strong advocate of working-class adult education, and suggested a &quot;people&#x27;s university&quot; in an address to the North Staffordshire Workers&#x27; Educational Association in 1925.

====Curricular philosophy====

Recently appointed to the House of Lords, Lindsay participated in producing the influential Foreign Office report &quot;University Reform in Germany&quot;, which argued that no institution deserved the name of &quot;university&quot; unless it combined teaching and research. Consistent with his democratic ideals of education, Lindsay also warned of the dangers of training the specialist intellect in the natural sciences and the need to introduce elements of social sciences at university level by broadening the academic agenda. Lindsay believed technological excesses sponsored by the state without a review of the social and political consequences had been a major contributor to Germany&#x27;s downfall. This was to heavily influence Keele&#x27;s curriculum. 

On 13 March 1946, Lindsay wrote to Sir Walter Moberly, chair of the University Grants Committee (UGC), suggesting the creation of a college &quot;on new lines&quot;. The committee wanted a university for the 20th century that could overcome the division between arts and sciences, and what Moberly was calling the &quot;evil of departmentalism&quot;. The UGC argued that &quot;The tasks of the modern citizen and the study of modern society should be central to the curriculum.&quot; North Staffordshire was seen as an ideal site since it &quot;presented many typical problems thrown up by modern industrial conglomerations, such as those posed by technical innovation in the pottery and mining industries.&quot; The college could become a &quot;social laboratory&quot; for industries and the local communities they catered for.

Normal practice was for new colleges (such as Southampton, Exeter and Nottingham) to be launched without degree-awarding powers. Students would instead matriculate with and take external degrees from the University of London. Lindsay wanted to &quot;get rid of the London external degree&quot; and instead found a college with degree-awarding authority, as well as the power to set its own syllabus, perhaps acting under the sponsorship of an established university. This would allow the college to start afresh in the setting of its curriculum. Lindsay wrote to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, tentatively requesting such sponsorship.

An exploratory committee was established by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, and, having secured public funding from the UGC in January 1948, the committee acquired Keele Hall on the outskirts of Newcastle-under-Lyme from its owner, Ralph Sneyd. The Hall was purchased together with the bulk of the Sneyd estate and a number of prefabricated structures erected by the Army during the Second World War for £31,000.

In August 1949 the university college was granted the right to award its own degrees. The first graduate was George Eason, who had studied mathematics at Birmingham University and gained a BSc in 1951. He received his MSc in 1952 from Keele. In 1954 the first graduate studying fully at Keele was Margaret Boulds, who received a dual honours degree in philosophy and English.

====Receiving university status====
Growing steadily to 1,200 students, the university college was granted university status in 1962, receiving a new royal charter in January that year, and adopting the name &quot;University of Keele&quot;. Alternatives were considered, including &quot;The University of Stoke&quot; or &quot;Stoke-on-Trent&quot;, but both were rejected because the estate is situated in the borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme. &quot;Staffordshire University&quot; was also discussed (this is now the name of the former North Staffordshire Polytechnic). The university is a short distance west of the civil parish of Keele, and it was decided to name it after the village. It is the only establishment of higher education in the UK to be named after a village, and this has long attracted questions as to its location. Together with Reading, Nottingham, Southampton, Hull, Exeter and Leicester, all university colleges founded a short time before or after the First World War, Keele was identified as one of the &quot;younger civic universities&quot; by the Robbins Report.

In 1968 the Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965–68) issued the Todd Report, which examined the possibility of a medical school being established at Keele. It was considered that North Staffordshire would be a good site, having a large local population and several hospitals. However, a minimum intake of 150 students each year would be necessary to make a medical school economically and educationally viable, and the university was at that time too small to support a medical school of this size.

Keele&#x27;s International Relations Department was founded in 1974 by Alan James and was one of the first institutions to offer a full degree in the subject. The Keele World Affairs Group, closely associated, followed suit in 1980. Keele&#x27;s first female professor was appointed to the Chair of Social Work in 1976. In 1978, Keele Department of Postgraduate Medicine was created, although it did not cater for undergraduate medical students.

===Government funding cuts===

In late 1985, after a series of cuts in university funding, Keele briefly considered merging with North Staffordshire Polytechnic, but negotiations collapsed. In September 1983, the Secretary of State, via the UGC, had encouraged the idea, asserting that the most radical way of increasing the size of departments and diminishing their number is by the merger of institutions. At the time, Keele had a population of 2,700 students, compared to 6,000 at the less academically exclusive Polytechnic. Edwina Currie, then Conservative MP for South Derbyshire, remarked, &quot;A university which is now below 3,000 students has got problems. It simply isn&#x27;t big enough&quot;. Keele University Science &amp; Business Park Ltd (KUSP Ltd) opened in 1987, partly to generate and diversify alternative sources of income.

In 1994, the Oswestry and North Staffordshire School of Physiotherapy (ONSSP), which had been a separate institution based at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry, Shropshire, merged with Keele University, becoming Keele&#x27;s Department of Physiotherapy Studies (now School of Health &amp; Rehabilitation). It moved to the Keele University campus. In August 1995, Keele University merged with North Staffordshire College of Nursing and Midwifery, forming the new School of Nursing and Midwifery. In 1998 and 1999 there was some controversy when the university decided to sell the Turner Collection, a valuable collection of printed mathematical books, including some which had belonged to and had been heavily annotated by Isaac Newton, in order to fund major improvements to the university library. Senior university officials authorised the sale of the collection to a private buyer, with no guarantee that it would remain intact or within the UK. Although the sale was legal, it was unpopular among the academic community, and the controversy was fuelled by prolonged negative press coverage suggesting that the £1m sale price was too low and that the collection was certain to be broken up.

===21st century developments===
====New Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing and Midwifery====
Sir David Weatherall was named as Chancellor in 2000. In 2001, Keele was awarded an undergraduate medical school in partnership with Manchester University. Initially, some students from Manchester Medical School began being taught at Keele. Finally Keele&#x27;s own medical school opened in 2007 with the first of cohort of students graduating in 2012. In 2009, the university was awarded a Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education, for &#x27;pioneering work with the NHS in early intervention and primary care in the treatment of chronic pain and arthritis, linking research to delivery to patients through GP networks and user groups&#x27;. In 2006 the School of Pharmacy was created with the launch of MPharm degree programmes.

In early 2001, to cut costs, the faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences merged. Due to declining popularity and funding, the German department closed in December 2004 with the university retaining its physics degree despite the subject facing similar pressures. Although degrees ceased to be offered in modern languages, a Language Learning Unit was created to provide Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian and Spanish teaching for Keele students and staff. This can lead to an enhanced degree title given sufficient electives taken.

The foundation year was eliminated in 1998 but re-introduced in 2012 with new programmes of study, the international foundation year and the accelerated international foundation year which add to the existing offer, as well as the humanities, science, social science, health, general foundation years and foundation year for people who are visually impaired.

====Environmental agenda and energy projects====
Starting in 2012, Keele has placed environmental sustainability at the heart of its strategy. In 2016, Keele was finalist in the Green Gown Awards for its &quot;significant reduction in carbon emissions and to a dedicated programme of carbon reduction projects supported by an excellent energy management system&quot;. In the People &amp; Planet Green League 2015 assessments for environmental and ethical performance, Keele ranked 48 of 151 educational establishments. The creation of a SMART energy centre due for completion in 2021 will allow the campus to become energy self-sufficient via waste recycling and alternative energy sources.
====Business School relocation and STEM expansion====
In 2017, Keele School of Management (KMS), which was at the time housed in the Darwin Building, decided to expand its offering at undergraduate level with new single honours programmes. The new science park Mercia Centre for Innovation and Leadership (MCIL) initiative, due for completion in 2019 serve as a relocation for the school. KMS also elected to work more closely with regional business actors e.g. Michelin Tyre PLC in Stoke-on-Trent by offering first year students the opportunity to work on live projects. Additionally, Keele has embarked on a major expansion of STEM subjects with a £45m investment.

====Veterinary School====
Harper and Keele Veterinary School opened in 2020 as a joint venture with Harper Adams University. It offers a five-year BVetMS degree. A new building offering teaching facilities, clinics and staff and student facilities on campus opened in October 2021.

===Symbols===

====Heraldry====

The heraldic grant of arms features the scythe of the Sneyd family, who owned the Keele park estate from 1540 to 1949, and includes the Sneyd family&#x27;s motto &quot;Thanke God for All&quot;. The shield features the colours red and yellow to represent the County of Staffordshire as well as the Staffordshire chevron. The Stafford knot for Stafford, the Fleur-de-Lys for Burton upon Trent and the Fret depict the historical association with the industry of Stoke-on-Trent. An open book joins Rodin&#x27;s &quot;Le Penseur&quot;, which is represented amid a wreath of laurel vert. Variations on this have appeared in various corporate logos and shield but this remains the formal grant of arms in official documents.

====Corporate logo====

Prior to 1986, the university shield was principally utilized on marketing (e.g. university prospectus) and communications material (corporate letterheads etc.). With the opening of the Science park, brand identity evolved with a new, modern corporate word marque featuring &#x27;Congress&#x27; and &#x27;Proteus&#x27; typefaces. In 1995, the corporate logo changed again with an intertwined ribbon motif representing the overlapping of educational disciplines. In 2011, the university shield returned relying heavily on the armorial bearings but with a modern twist for the digital age.

====Academic dress====
The academic gowns reflect the colours of the County of Staffordshire and emphasise red and yellow. Higher Doctorates utilise purple, whilst the College of Fellows uses red and gold.

==Campus==
===Setting===

Located in North Staffordshire, Keele&#x27;s campus is rural with many 19th-century architectural features such as Keele Hall predating the concrete and red-brick buildings of the modern university. The campus occupies a rural campus close to the village of Keele and consists of extensive woods, lakes and Keele Hall set in Staffordshire Potteries. The estate was originally given by King Henry II of England to the Knights Templars in 1180. When the Templars were condemned and dissolved by the Council of Vienne in 1311, their possessions were annexed by the Knights Hospitallers until their dissolution by Henry VIII. The estate was purchased from the Crown by the Sneyd family and remained their property until acquisition by the Stoke-on-Trent Corporation in 1948. Apart from increasing numbers of academic and residential buildings, other facilities include an astronomical observatory, arts and cultural programme, arboretum, Islamic centre, shops, cafés and places to eat and drink. The campus has science, business enterprise parks and conference centres. It is home to the Earth Science Education Unit (ESEU). The chapel is located in the centre of the campus, close to the university library and student union. From the onset, Christian worship was central to university life. Lindsay, first principal of the University College, was an ardent Christian preaching every Sunday in the Library Reading room of Keele Hall. A permanent structure was required and the chapel was built in 1965. Built from Staffordshire blue brick, the chapel accommodates different Christian traditions.
===Halls of residence===
There are five halls of residence on the main campus: Horwood, Lindsay, Barnes, Holly Cross and The Oaks. (Hawthorns Hall was located off site in Keele village just outside the main entrance. However, the site has been sold for redevelopment, and the halls demolished.) These halls provide accommodation for 70% of all full-time students. Three of the oldest halls, Horwood (1957), Lindsay (1964) and Barnes (1970) are named after the founding fathers of the university. The Oaks (1992), west of Lindsay Hall, is named after four oak trees that were felled to pave the way for the university residence and Holly Cross (1993). The Hawthorns (1957), remnants of the Sneyd property in Keele Village, was originally a large house, two paddocks and gardens totalling 13 acres.

===Planned developments===

Following student demand for accommodation on-campus, in 2018, Barnes hall of residence will be re-developed with new residential units added to cater for an additional 453 bedrooms, funded from the proceeds of the sale of the Hawthorns.

===Science Park===
The university operates a Science Park under a wholly owned subsidiary company, Keele University Science &amp; Business Park Limited.

===Library===
When the university was founded in 1948, the Librarian&#x27;s office was located above a public house in Stoke, near the Town Hall. In 1952, the old Sneyd Library was used with 20,000 items which increased to 70,000 by 1954. By 1955, 155,000 volumes were accounted for and necessitating 12 full-time staff. Later, the Senate Room in Keele Hall was used to house the material. Construction of the new library campus began in 1961 with additional expansion completed in 1966. By the early 1970s, the library was able to accommodate 750 readers and 600,000 books.

====Material acquisition====
The university purchased the collection of deceased Belgian Professor Charles Saroléa, consisting of between 150,000 and 300,000 items. A viewing was organized and an agreement reached with the trustees to the acquisition of 120,000 books at a cost of £1348. However, the books were stocked in Edinburgh and removing the items without delay was one of the conditions of the agreement. A price per ton was fixed and the books arrived, first in a Methodist church school where each item was sorted and cataloged. The books were transferred to the new campus building in 1961.

====Later developments====
The library catalogue and circulation system was automated in 1990. In 1993, the Computer Centre merged with the library, renamed Keele Information Services (KIS). The library allowed for new PC labs and an IT Helpdesk to assist students. With further modernisation in 2006, a self-service digitised counter was opened and refurbishment of different library wings. In 2005, following students&#x27; requests, a group study area was incorporated in the Short-Loan library. The library is now opened 24/7 during each semester.

====Health Library====
Since the founding of the Keele University School of Medicine, a Health Library is available to both Keele students and National Health Service (NHS) staff at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. An IT suite complements the material with 60 workstations.

==Organisation and administration==
===Liberal arts college ethos===

The university&#x27;s curriculum required every student to study two principal subjects to honours level, as well as further subsidiary subjects, with an additional requirement that students should study at least one subject from each of the subject groupings of Arts, Sciences and Social Sciences. The cross-disciplinary requirement was reinforced by the Foundation Year, an innovation which meant that for the first year of the four-year programmes, all students would study a common course of interdisciplinary &quot;foundation studies&quot;. This key particularity of the Keele curriculum led Michael Brawne to remark in 1966 that the university was &quot;the nearest thing in Britain to the small liberal arts college in the US&quot;.

Standard three-year degrees were introduced in 1973 and the numbers of students following the Foundation Year course have steadily dwindled since. The Foundation Year has never been formally discontinued, however, and remains an option for prospective students who qualify for entry into higher education, but lack subject-specific qualifications for specific degree programmes. By contrast, almost 90 per cent of current undergraduates read dual honours. Able to combine any two available subjects, students have a choice of over 500 degree courses in all. The university also offers a study abroad semester to most of its students.

As an experimental community, Keele was initially founded as a &quot;wholly residential&quot; institution. Of the initial intake of 159 students in October 1950, 149 were resident on campus, and it was required of the first professors appointed that they should also be in residence. With the expansion of the university, total residency has long since been abandoned, but the proportion of full-time students resident on campus remains above average at 62% in 2011.

=== Faculties, Schools, and Academic Disciplines ===
Keele&#x27;s academic activities are organised into 3 faculties, divided into the following schools and disciplines:
All undergraduate courses, with the exception of Medicine and Pharmacy, are modular, with the academic year divided into two semesters, with breaks at Christmas and Easter. There are approximately 14 students to every member of staff.

==Governance==
The statutes of the university are laid out in its Royal Charter granted in 1962. These describe the organisational structure and powers that allow the university to function and govern its affairs. The Chancellor is appointed by an elected council every 5 years or until resignation and supplemented by a Pro-Chancellor and Deputy Pro-Chancellors. The Vice-Chancellor, also appointed by the council, requires approval from the senate and is the principal academic and administrative officer of the university. All are officers of the university.


===University partnerships &amp; overseas exchange programmes===

The university operates several collaborative arrangements with educational establishments in the UK and abroad. In 2016, in the UK and regionally, Keele held joint contracts/awards with Liverpool University (Marie Curie Palliative Care Institution), University of Salford and Staffordshire University. Keele also has multiple franchise agreements, represented in South East Asia with SEGo College, KDU University College and the Sri Lankan Institute of Information Technology. Early overseas exchange programmes in the 1950s debuted in the US with Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania and Reed College, Oregon whilst, in continental Europe, with Université de Nancy. Today, Keele has exchange agreements with over 80 academic institutions worldwide.

===Finance===
According to the university&#x27;s Statement of Accounts for 2015/16, total income for the year ending 31 July 2016 was just over £148.5 million with a total expenditure of £140.5 million. This amounted to a consolidated surplus of £8 million and a slight increase of £3.6 million on a yearly basis. For 2015/16, income was primarily derived from academic fees raking £71.3 million with home and European Union students the largest group accounting for £50.3 million followed by international students with £13.6 million. Tuition fees and education contracts account for 48% of total income received before donations and endowments. The university has continued to invest in capital projects with the refurbishments of the Walter Moberley and Huxley buildings, an upgrade to the Sports Centre facilities and a new HR/payroll system.

===Keele College of Fellows===
In 2011, Keele established a college of fellows to promote the activities of the university outside the traditional realm of academia. Current members includes alumni who have demarcated themselves in the field of industry, media and/or public service as well as key stakeholders from in and around Staffordshire.

==Academic profile and reputation==

Keele has a graduation rate of over 90%, with 68.4% achieving 1sts or 2:1s. 90% of undergraduates are state-educated, and over 25% of students are from working-class backgrounds. In recent years Keele has attempted to boost this number by reaching out to local schools and hosting a summer school. In February 2011, a Sutton Trust report revealed that 3·4% of students had received free school meals, whilst 7·9% had attended private schools. This compares the national figures for England of 14% eligible for free school meals, and 7% independently educated.

===Admissions===
New students entering Keele in 2016 had an average of 128 UCAS points or ABB at A&#x27;Level. Typically three-year degree courses ask for A&#x27;Level grades (or equivalent) of between AAB and BBC with the exception of Medicine. Keele has made it a priority to attract applicants with ABB grades and above at A&#x27;Level. The university also aspires to enter the top 30 across league tables by 2020. In May 2012 Keele was listed by the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; (THE) magazine as among the world&#x27;s top 100 new (50 years old or less) universities. In September 2016, Keele was awarded &#x27;University of the Year for Student Experience&#x27; (The Times and The Sunday Times annual University of the Year awards, 2017).

====UCAS clearing====
Keele has traditionally participated in the UCAS clearing process and it has become customary for the university to lower its requirements to fill outstanding places. In August 2023, the university reduced its academic demands to 64 UCAS points or higher equivalent to 2 A&#x27;Levels at grades C in dual and single honours degree programmes with vacancies remaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.keele.ac.uk/clearing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
According to the National Student Survey (NSS) and excluding private or specialist institutions, the university ranked first for Student Satisfaction in 2014, 2015 and 2016 (jointly with the University of St Andrews) amongst broad-based educational establishments. The NSS is aimed at final year undergraduates, gathering opinions about their experience of their courses and the institution. It is conducted independently and a key quality indicator of higher education in the UK. In 2015, disciplines that scored highest included Education, Geology, Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing, Physiotherapy, Biochemistry, English and Mathematics. In June 2017, Keele was awarded Gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) which measures excellence in three areas: teaching quality, the learning environment and the educational and professional outcomes achieved by students. In the 2023 TEF assessment, the university maintained its overall Gold rating.

==Research==
Keele submitted 60% of its staff to the 2014 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and ranked 57 of 128 institutions by grade point average (GPA) The university scored particularly well in public health, health services and primary care. Medical research includes detecting Parkinson&#x27;s disease early, and using stem cell research to aid the healing process. The cochlear implant was developed in the Department of Communication and Neuroscience at Keele. Other notable medical pursuits includes attempts to explain the evolution of the human brain, looking into links between cannabis and mental illness (cited in the 2009 reclassification debate), as well as tumour and cancer research. In August 2009, university astronomers, led by David Anderson, discovered the first planet that orbits in the opposite direction to the spin of its star. The planet was named WASP-17b. In 2010 Richard Stephens, John Atkins, and Andrew Kingston won the Ig Nobel prize for confirming the widely held belief that swearing relieves pain. In 2010 a medical centre in Newport, Shropshire was completed, for students to learn in real medical situations and to research medical sciences.
==Student life==
===Students&#x27; Union===
Keele University Students&#x27; Union organises social activities throughout the year. The principal Students&#x27; Union building was designed by Stillman &amp; Eastwick-Field (now part of the T. P. Bennett practice), with some guidance from the university&#x27;s architect, J. A. Pickavance. It opened in 1962 and was completed in 1963, extended in the 1970s and the ground-floor interior remodelled in 2011–2012. Its magazine, &quot;Concourse&quot;, was founded in 1964 and is issued monthly during term time. It is editorially independent of both the university and the students&#x27; union.

===Student activity===
The Keele team won the 1968 series of &quot;University Challenge&quot;. The same team also made runner up to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge (1979) in the 2002 special &quot;University Challenge: Reunited&quot;.

===Student sports===
Keele sports range from rugby to lacrosse and dodgeball. Sports teams and issues raised are managed by the Athletic Union. The centre has two national standard sports halls, a single court gymnasium, a fitness centre, dance studio and climbing wall. Outside there is an all weather floodlit AstroTurf pitch, tennis courts and extensive playing fields. It is also the first university centre in the UK to offer a full &quot;Kinesis&quot; gym facility.
Keele University Sports Centre hosts the matches of Newcastle (Staffs) Volleyball Club, providing around 110 tiered seats with the perfect view of some of the best matches in English Volleyball. In 2012, Keele University took part in the first official inter-university Muggle Quidditch match, winning and thus becoming the top ranked team in the country. The sport has since expanded and Keele has remained one of the forerunners, finishing in second place at the British Quidditch Cup in November 2013. The university also hosted eight teams for the Northern Cup in March 2014.

<text>Starfish or sea stars are star-shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea (). Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or basket stars. Starfish are also known as asteroids due to being in the class Asteroidea. About 1,900 species of starfish live on the seabed in all the world&#x27;s oceans, from warm, tropical zones to frigid, polar regions. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, at below the surface.

Starfish are marine invertebrates. They typically have a central disc and usually five arms, though some species have a larger number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defense. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (&quot;Pisaster ochraceus&quot;) and the reef sea star (&quot;Stichaster australis&quot;), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (&quot;Acanthaster planci&quot;) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the Northern Pacific seastar is on the list of the World&#x27;s 100 Worst Invasive Alien Species.

The fossil record for starfish is ancient, dating back to the Ordovician around 450 million years ago, but it is rather sparse, as starfish tend to disintegrate after death. Only the ossicles and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.

==Anatomy==

Most starfish have five arms that radiate from a central disc, but the number varies with the group. Some species have six or seven arms and others have 10–15 arms. The Antarctic &quot;Labidiaster annulatus&quot; can have over fifty.

Mapping the expression patterns of genes that express differently across the body axes suggests that one could think of the body of a starfish as a disembodied head walking about the sea floor on its lips. The known markers for trunk structures are expressed only in internal tissues rather than on the surface. Only the front part of the axis, which specifies head-related structures, is represented on the body surface.

===Body wall===


The body wall consists of a thin cuticle, an epidermis consisting of a single layer of cells, a thick dermis formed of connective tissue and a thin coelomic myoepithelial layer, which provides the longitudinal and circular musculature. The dermis contains an endoskeleton of calcium carbonate components known as ossicles. These are honeycombed structures composed of calcite microcrystals arranged in a lattice. They vary in form, with some bearing external granules, tubercles and spines, but most are tabular plates that fit neatly together in a tessellated manner and form the main covering of the aboral surface. Some are specialised structures such as the madreporite (the entrance to the water vascular system), pedicellariae and paxillae. Pedicellariae are compound ossicles with forceps-like jaws. They remove debris from the body surface and wave around on flexible stalks in response to physical or chemical stimuli while continually making biting movements. They often form clusters surrounding spines. Paxillae are umbrella-like structures found on starfish that live buried in sediment. The edges of adjacent paxillae meet to form a false cuticle with a water cavity beneath in which the madreporite and delicate gill structures are protected. All the ossicles, including those projecting externally, are covered by the epidermal layer.

Several groups of starfish, including Valvatida and Forcipulatida, possess pedicellariae. In Forcipulatida, such as &quot;Asterias&quot; and &quot;Pisaster&quot;, they occur in pompom-like tufts at the base of each spine, whereas in the Goniasteridae, such as &quot;Hippasteria phrygiana&quot;, the pedicellariae are scattered over the body surface. Some are thought to assist in defence, while others aid in feeding or in the removal of organisms attempting to settle on the starfish&#x27;s surface. Some species like &quot;Labidiaster annulatus&quot;, &quot;Rathbunaster californicus&quot; and &quot;Novodinia antillensis&quot; use their large pedicellariae to capture small fish and crustaceans.

There may also be papulae, thin-walled protrusions of the body cavity that reach through the body wall and extend into the surrounding water. These serve a respiratory function. The structures are supported by collagen fibres set at right angles to each other and arranged in a three-dimensional web with the ossicles and papulae in the . This arrangement enables both easy flexion of the arms by the starfish and the rapid onset of stiffness and rigidity required for actions performed under stress.

===Water vascular system===

The water vascular system of the starfish is a hydraulic system made up of a network of fluid-filled canals and is concerned with locomotion, adhesion, food manipulation and gas exchange. Water enters the system through the madreporite, a porous, often conspicuous, sieve-like ossicle on the aboral surface. It is linked through a stone canal, often lined with calcareous material, to a ring canal around the mouth opening. A set of radial canals leads off this; one radial canal runs along the groove in each arm. There are short lateral canals branching off alternately to either side of the radial canal, each ending in an ampulla. These bulb-shaped organs are joined to tube feet (podia) on the exterior of the animal by short linking canals that pass through ossicles in the ambulacral groove. There are usually two rows of tube feet but in some species, the lateral canals are alternately long and short and there appear to be four rows. The interior of the whole canal system is lined with cilia.

When longitudinal muscles in the ampullae contract, valves in the lateral canals close and water is forced into the tube feet. These extend to contact the substrate. Although the tube feet resemble suction cups in appearance, the gripping action is a function of adhesive chemicals rather than suction. Other chemicals and relaxation of the ampullae allow for release from the substrate. The tube feet latch on to surfaces and move in a wave, with one arm section attaching to the surface as another releases. Some starfish turn up the tips of their arms while moving which gives maximum exposure of the sensory tube feet and the eyespot to external stimuli.

Having descended from bilateral organisms, starfish may move in a bilateral fashion, particularly when hunting or in danger. When crawling, certain arms act as the leading arms, while others trail behind. Most starfish cannot move quickly, a typical speed being that of the leather star (&quot;Dermasterias imbricata&quot;), which can manage just in a minute. Some burrowing species from the genera &quot;Astropecten&quot; and &quot;Luidia&quot; have points rather than suckers on their long tube feet and are capable of much more rapid motion, &quot;gliding&quot; across the ocean floor. The sand star (&quot;Luidia foliolata&quot;) can travel at a speed of per minute. When a starfish finds itself upside down, two adjacent arms are bent backwards to provide support, the opposite arm is used to stamp the ground while the two remaining arms are raised on either side; finally the stamping arm is released as the starfish turns itself over and recovers its normal stance.

Apart from their function in locomotion, the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, and carbon dioxide to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.

===Digestive system and excretion===
The gut of a starfish occupies most of the disc and extends into the arms. The mouth is located in the centre of the oral surface, where it is surrounded by a tough membrane and closed with a sphincter. The mouth opens through a short oesophagus into a stomach divided by a constriction into a larger, cardiac portion and a smaller pyloric portion. The cardiac stomach is glandular and pouched, and is supported by ligaments attached to ossicles in the arms so it can be pulled back into position after it has been everted. The pyloric stomach has two extensions into each arm: the pyloric caeca. These are elongated, branched hollow tubes that are lined by a series of glands, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from the food. A short intestine and rectum run from the pyloric stomach to open at a small anus at the apex of the aboral surface of the disc.

Primitive starfish, such as &quot;Astropecten&quot; and &quot;Luidia&quot;, swallow their prey whole, and start to digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other inedible materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism&#x27;s body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is passed on to the pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.

Because of this ability to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and gastropod molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.

The main nitrogenous waste product is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains phagocytic cells called coelomocytes, which are also found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to the tips of the papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.

Starfish do not appear to have any mechanisms for osmoregulation, and keep their body fluids at the same salt concentration as the surrounding water. Although some species can tolerate relatively low salinity, the lack of an osmoregulation system probably explains why starfish are not found in fresh water or even in many estuarine environments.

===Sensory and nervous systems===

Although starfish do not have many well-defined sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation and the status of the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.

While a starfish lacks a centralized brain, it has a complex nervous system with a nerve ring around the mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of each arm parallel to the radial canal. The peripheral nerve system consists of two nerve nets: a sensory system in the epidermis and a motor system in the lining of the coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the dermis connect the two. The ring nerves and radial nerves have sensory and motor components and coordinate the starfish&#x27;s balance and directional systems. The sensory component receives input from the sensory organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish does not have the capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.

===Circulatory system===

The body cavity contains the circulatory or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) and the third near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is at the apex of a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of each arm are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads to the tip of the arm. This vessel has a blind end and there is no continuous circulation of the fluid within it. This liquid does not contain a pigment and has little or no respiratory function but is probably used to transport nutrients around the body.

===Secondary metabolites===
Starfish produce a large number of secondary metabolites in the form of lipids, including steroidal derivatives of cholesterol, and fatty acid amides of sphingosine. The steroids are mostly saponins, known as asterosaponins, and their sulphated derivatives. They vary between species and are typically formed from up to six sugar molecules (usually glucose and galactose) connected by up to three glycosidic chains. Long-chain fatty acid amides of sphingosine occur frequently and some of them have known pharmacological activity. Various ceramides are also known from starfish and a small number of alkaloids have also been identified. The functions of these chemicals in the starfish have not been fully investigated but most have roles in defence and communication. Some are feeding deterrents used by the starfish to discourage predation. Others are and supplement the pedicellariae to prevent other organisms from settling on the starfish&#x27;s aboral surface. Some are alarm pheromones and escape-eliciting chemicals, the release of which trigger responses in conspecific starfish but often produce escape responses in potential prey. Research into the efficacy of these compounds for possible pharmacological or industrial use occurs worldwide.

==Life cycle==

===Sexual reproduction===

Most species of starfish are gonochorous, there being separate male and female individuals. These are usually not distinguishable externally as the gonads cannot be seen, but their sex is apparent when they spawn. Some species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, producing eggs and sperm at the same time, and in a few of these the same gonad, called an ovotestis, produces both eggs and sperm. Other starfish are sequential hermaphrodites. Protandrous individuals of species like &quot;Asterina gibbosa&quot; start life as males before changing sex into females as they grow older. In some species such as &quot;Nepanthia belcheri&quot;, a large female can split in half and the resulting offspring are males. When these grow large enough they change back into females.

Each starfish arm contains two gonads that release gametes through openings called gonoducts, located on the central disc between the arms. Fertilization is generally external but in a few species, internal fertilization takes place. In most species, the buoyant eggs and sperm are simply released into the water (free spawning) and the resulting embryos and larvae live as part of the plankton. In others, the eggs may be stuck to the undersides of rocks. In certain species of starfish, the females brood their eggs – either by simply enveloping them or by holding them in specialised structures. Brooding may be done in pockets on the starfish&#x27;s aboral surface, inside the pyloric stomach (&quot;Leptasterias tenera&quot;) or even in the interior of the gonads themselves. Those starfish that brood their eggs by &quot;sitting&quot; on them usually assume a humped posture with their discs raised off the substrate. &quot;Pteraster militaris&quot; broods a few of its young and disperses the remaining eggs, that are too numerous to fit into its pouch. In these brooding species, the eggs are relatively large, and supplied with yolk, and they generally develop directly into miniature starfish without an intervening larval stage. The developing young are called lecithotrophic because they obtain their nutrition from the yolk as opposed to &quot;planktotrophic&quot; larvae that feed in the water column. In &quot;Parvulastra parvivipara&quot;, an brooder, the young starfish obtain nutrients by eating other eggs and embryos in the brood pouch. Brooding is especially common in polar and deep-sea species that live in environments unfavourable for larval development and in smaller species that produce just a few eggs.

In the tropics, a plentiful supply of phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning takes place at any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season. In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species to spawn may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes synchronously. In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair. This behaviour is called pseudocopulation and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to spawn. Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning (day length to indicate the correct time of the year, dawn or dusk to indicate the correct time of day), and chemical signals to indicate their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.

===Larval development===
Most starfish embryos hatch at the blastula stage. The original ball of cells develops a lateral pouch, the archenteron. The entrance to this is known as the blastopore and it will later develop into the anus—together with chordates, echinoderms are deuterostomes, meaning the second (&quot;deutero&quot;) invagination becomes the mouth (&quot;stome&quot;); members of all other phyla are protostomes, and their first invagination becomes the mouth. Another invagination of the surface will fuse with the tip of the archenteron as the mouth while the interior section will become the gut. At the same time, a band of cilia develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a bipinnaria. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting phytoplankton towards the mouth.

The next stage in development is a brachiolaria larva and involves the growth of three short, additional arms. These are at the anterior end, surround a sucker and have adhesive cells at their tips. Both bipinnaria and brachiolaria larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. When fully developed, the brachiolaria settles on the seabed and attaches itself with a short stalk formed from the ventral arms and sucker. Metamorphosis now takes place with a radical rearrangement of tissues. The left side of the larval body becomes the oral surface of the juvenile and the right side the aboral surface. Part of the gut is retained, but the mouth and anus move to new positions. Some of the body cavities degenerate but others become the water vascular system and the visceral coelom. The starfish is now pentaradially symmetrical. It casts off its stalk and becomes a free-living juvenile starfish about in diameter. Starfish of the order Paxillosida have no brachiolaria stage, with the bipinnaria larvae settling on the seabed and developing directly into juveniles.

===Asexual reproduction===

Some species of starfish in the three families Asterinidae, Asteriidae and Solasteridae are able to reproduce asexually as adults either by fission of their central discs or by autotomy of one or more of their arms. Which of these processes occurs depends on the genus. Among starfish that are able to regenerate their whole body from a single arm, some can do so even from fragments just long. Single arms that regenerate a whole individual are called comet forms. The division of the starfish, either across its disc or at the base of the arm, is usually accompanied by a weakness in the structure that provides a fracture zone.

The larvae of several species of starfish can reproduce asexually before they reach maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.

===Regeneration===

Some species of starfish have the ability to regenerate lost arms and can regrow an entire new limb given time. A few can regrow a complete new disc from a single arm, while others need at least part of the central disc to be attached to the detached part. Regrowth can take several months or years, and starfish are vulnerable to infections during the early stages after the loss of an arm. A separated limb lives off stored nutrients until it regrows a disc and mouth and is able to feed again. Other than fragmentation carried out for the purpose of reproduction, the division of the body may happen inadvertently due to part being detached by a predator, or part may be actively shed by the starfish in an escape response. The loss of parts of the body is achieved by the rapid softening of a special type of connective tissue in response to nervous signals. This type of tissue is called catch connective tissue and is found in most echinoderms. An autotomy-promoting factor has been identified which, when injected into another starfish, causes rapid shedding of arms.

===Lifespan===

The lifespan of a starfish varies considerably between species, generally being longer in larger forms and in those with planktonic larvae. For example, &quot;Leptasterias hexactis&quot; broods a small number of large-yolked eggs. It has an adult weight of , reaches sexual maturity in two years and lives for about ten years. &quot;Pisaster ochraceus&quot; releases a large number of eggs into the sea each year and has an adult weight of up to . It reaches maturity in five years and has a maximum recorded lifespan of 34 years. The average lifespan of a starfish is 35 years, and larger starfish species typically live longer than their smaller counterparts.

==Ecology==

===Distribution and habitat===

Echinoderms, including starfish, maintain a delicate internal electrolyte balance that is in equilibrium with sea water, making it impossible for them to live in a freshwater habitat. Starfish species inhabit all of the world&#x27;s oceans. Habitats range from tropical coral reefs, rocky shores, tidal pools, mud, and sand to kelp forests, seagrass meadows and the deep-sea floor down to at least . The greatest diversity of species occurs in coastal areas.

===Diet===
Most species are generalist predators, eating microalgae, sponges, bivalves, snails and other small animals. The crown-of-thorns starfish consumes coral polyps, while other species are detritivores, feeding on decomposing organic material and faecal matter. A few are suspension feeders, gathering in phytoplankton; &quot;Henricia&quot; and &quot;Echinaster&quot; often occur in association with sponges, benefiting from the water current they produce. Various species have been shown to be able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this may form a significant portion of their diet.

The processes of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; &quot;Pisaster brevispinus&quot;, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, can use a set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey&#x27;s shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be a fraction of a millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry. Cannibalism has been observed in juvenile sea stars as early as four days after metamorphosis.

===Ecological impact===

Starfish are keystone species in their respective marine communities. Their relatively large sizes, diverse diets and ability to adapt to different environments makes them ecologically important. The term &quot;keystone species&quot; was in fact first used by Robert Paine in 1966 to describe a starfish, &quot;Pisaster ochraceus&quot;. When studying the low intertidal coasts of Washington state, Paine found that predation by &quot;P. ochraceus&quot; was a major factor in the diversity of species. Experimental removals of this top predator from a stretch of shoreline resulted in lower species diversity and the eventual domination of &quot;Mytilus&quot; mussels, which were able to outcompete other organisms for space and resources. Similar results were found in a 1971 study of &quot;Stichaster australis&quot; on the intertidal coast of the South Island of New Zealand. &quot;S. australis&quot; was found to have removed most of a batch of transplanted mussels within two or three months of their placement, while in an area from which &quot;S. australis&quot; had been removed, the mussels increased in number dramatically, overwhelming the area and threatening biodiversity.

The feeding activity of the omnivorous starfish &quot;Oreaster reticulatus&quot; on sandy and seagrass bottoms in the Virgin Islands appears to regulate the diversity, distribution and abundance of microorganisms. These starfish engulf piles of sediment removing the surface films and algae adhering to the particles. Organisms that dislike this disturbance are replaced by others better able to rapidly recolonise &quot;clean&quot; sediment. In addition, foraging by these migratory starfish creates diverse patches of organic matter, which may play a role in the distribution and abundance of organisms such as fish, crabs and sea urchins that feed on the sediment.

Starfish sometimes have negative effects on ecosystems. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish have caused damage to coral reefs in Northeast Australia and French Polynesia. A study in Polynesia found that coral cover declined drastically with the arrival of migratory starfish in 2006, dropping from 50% to under 5% in three years. This had a cascading effect on the whole benthic community and reef-feeding fish. &quot;Asterias amurensis&quot; is one of a few echinoderm invasive species. Its larvae likely arrived in Tasmania from central Japan via water discharged from ships in the 1980s. The species has since grown in numbers to the point where they threaten commercially important bivalve populations. As such, they are considered pests, and are on the Invasive Species Specialist Group&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive species.

Sea Stars (starfish) are the main predators of kelp-eating sea urchins. Satellite imagery shows that sea urchin populations have exploded due to starfish mass deaths, and that by 2021, sea urchins have destroyed 95% of California&#x27;s kelp forests.

===Threats===
Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, sea anemones, other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters. Their first lines of defence are the saponins present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours. Some starfish such as &quot;Astropecten polyacanthus&quot; also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out large quantities of repellent mucus. They also have body armour in the form of hard plates and spines. The crown-of-thorns starfish is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours. Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.

Several species sometimes suffer from a wasting condition caused by bacteria in the genus &quot;Vibrio&quot;; however, a more widespread wasting disease, causing mass mortalities among starfish, appears sporadically. A paper published in November 2014 revealed the most likely cause of this disease to be a densovirus the authors named sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV).
The protozoan &quot;Orchitophrya stellarum&quot; is known to infect the gonads of starfish and damage tissue. Starfish are vulnerable to high temperatures. Experiments have shown that the feeding and growth rates of &quot;P. ochraceus&quot; reduce greatly when their body temperatures rise above and that they die when their temperature rises to . This species has a unique ability to absorb seawater to keep itself cool when it is exposed to sunlight by a receding tide. It also appears to rely on its arms to absorb heat, so as to protect the central disc and vital organs like the stomach.

Starfish and other echinoderms are sensitive to marine pollution. The common starfish is considered to be a bioindicator for marine ecosystems. A 2009 study found that &quot;P. ochraceus&quot; is unlikely to be affected by ocean acidification as severely as other marine animals with calcareous skeletons. In other groups, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution when the pH is lowered. Researchers found that when &quot;P. ochraceus&quot; were exposed to and 770 ppm carbon dioxide (beyond rises expected in the next century), they were relatively unaffected. Their survival is likely due to the nodular nature of their skeletons, which are able to compensate for a shortage of carbonate by growing more fleshy tissue.

==Evolution==

===Fossil record===

Echinoderms first appeared in the fossil record in the Cambrian. The first known asterozoans were the Somasteroidea, which exhibit characteristics of both groups. Starfish are infrequently found as fossils, possibly because their hard skeletal components separate as the animal decays. Despite this, there are a few places where accumulations of complete skeletal structures occur, fossilized in place in Lagerstätten – so-called &quot;starfish beds&quot;.

By the late Paleozoic, the crinoids and blastoids were the predominant echinoderms, and some limestones from this period are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In the two major extinction events that occurred during the late Devonian and late Permian, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived. Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly within about sixty million years during the Early Jurassic and the beginning of the Middle Jurassic. A 2012 study found that speciation in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of &quot;Cryptasterina hystera&quot; and &quot;Cryptasterina pentagona&quot; has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and brooding and the latter remaining a broadcast spawner.

===Diversity===


The scientific name Asteroidea was given to starfish by the French zoologist de Blainville in 1830. It is derived from the Greek &quot;aster&quot;, ἀστήρ (a star) and the Greek &quot;eidos&quot;, εἶδος (form, likeness, appearance). The class Asteroidea belongs to the phylum Echinodermata. As well as the starfish, the echinoderms include sea urchins, sand dollars, brittle and basket stars, sea cucumbers and crinoids. The larvae of echinoderms have bilateral symmetry, but during metamorphosis this is replaced with radial symmetry, typically pentameric. Adult echinoderms are characterized by having a water vascular system with external tube feet and a calcareous endoskeleton consisting of ossicles connected by a mesh of collagen fibres. Starfish are included in the subphylum Asterozoa, the characteristics of which include a flattened, star-shaped body as adults consisting of a central disc and multiple radiating arms. The subphylum includes the two classes of Asteroidea, the starfish, and Ophiuroidea, the brittle stars and basket stars. Asteroids have broad-based arms with skeletal support provided by calcareous plates in the body wall while ophiuroids have clearly demarcated slender arms strengthened by paired fused ossicles forming jointed &quot;vertebrae&quot;.

The starfish are a large and diverse class with over 1,900 living species. There are seven extant orders, Brisingida, Forcipulatida, Notomyotida, Paxillosida, Spinulosida, Valvatida and Velatida and two extinct ones, Calliasterellidae and Trichasteropsida. Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically distinct from their forerunners in the Paleozoic. The taxonomy of the group is relatively stable but there is ongoing debate about the status of the Paxillosida, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in Velatida, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage. Phylogenetic data suggests that they may be a sister group, the Concentricycloidea, to the Neoasteroidea, or that the Velatida themselves may be a sister group.

====Living groups====

; Brisingida (2 families, 17 genera, 111 species)
:Species in this order have a small, inflexible disc and 6–20 long, thin arms, which they use for suspension feeding. They have a single series of marginal plates, a fused ring of disc plates, a reduced number of aboral plates, crossed pedicellariae, and several series of long spines on the arms. They live almost exclusively in deep-sea habitats, although a few live in shallow waters in the Antarctic. In some species, the tube feet have rounded tips and lack suckers.

; Forcipulatida (6 families, 63 genera, 269 species)
:Species in this order have distinctive pedicellariae, consisting of a short stalk with three skeletal ossicles. They tend to have robust bodies and have tube feet with flat-tipped suckers usually arranged in four rows. The order includes well-known species from temperate regions, including the common starfish of North Atlantic coasts and rock pools, as well as cold-water and abyssal species.
; Notomyotida (1 family, 8 genera, 75 species)
:These starfish are deep-sea dwelling and have particularly flexible arms. The inner dorso-lateral surfaces of the arms contain characteristic longitudinal muscle bands. In some species, the tube feet lack suckers.

; Paxillosida (7 families, 48 genera, 372 species)
:This is a primitive order and members do not extrude their stomach when feeding, lack an anus and have no suckers on their tube feet. Papulae are plentiful on their aboral surface and they possess marginal plates and paxillae. They mostly inhabit soft-bottomed areas of sand or mud. There is no brachiolaria stage in their larval development. The comb starfish (&quot;Astropecten polyacanthus&quot;) is a member of this order.

; Spinulosida (1 family, 8 genera, 121 species)
:Most species in this order lack pedicellariae and all have a delicate skeletal arrangement with small or no marginal plates on the disc and arms. They have numerous groups of short spines on the aboral surface. This group includes the red starfish &quot;Echinaster sepositus&quot;.
; Valvatida (16 families, 172 genera, 695 species)
:Most species in this order have five arms and two rows of tube feet with suckers. There are conspicuous marginal plates on the arms and disc. Some species have paxillae and in some, the main pedicellariae are clamp-like and recessed into the skeletal plates. This group includes the cushion stars, the leather star and the sea daisies.
; Velatida (4 families, 16 genera, 138 species)
:This order of starfish consists mostly of deep-sea and other cold-water starfish often with a global distribution. The shape is pentagonal or star-shaped with five to fifteen arms. They mostly have poorly developed skeletons with papulae widely distributed on the aboral surface and often spiny pedicellariae. This group includes the slime star.

====Extinct groups====
Extinct groups within the Asteroidea include:
* † Calliasterellidae, with the type genus &quot;Calliasterella&quot; from the Devonian and Carboniferous
* † Palastericus, a Devonian genus
* † Trichasteropsida, with the Triassic genus &quot;Trichasteropsis&quot; (at least 2 species)

===Phylogeny===

====External====

Starfish are deuterostome animals, like the chordates. A 2014 analysis of 219 genes from all classes of echinoderms gives the following phylogenetic tree. The times at which the clades diverged are shown under the labels in millions of years ago (mya).

====Internal====

The phylogeny of the Asteroidea has been difficult to resolve, with visible (morphological) features proving inadequate, and the question of whether traditional taxa are clades in doubt. The phylogeny proposed by Gale in 1987 is:

The phylogeny proposed by Blake in 1987 is:

Later work making use of molecular evidence, with or without the use of morphological evidence, had by 2000 failed to resolve the argument. In 2011, on further molecular evidence, Janies and colleagues noted that the phylogeny of the echinoderms &quot;has proven difficult&quot;, and that &quot;the overall phylogeny of extant echinoderms remains sensitive to the choice of analytical methods&quot;. They presented a phylogenetic tree for the living Asteroidea only; using the traditional names of starfish orders where possible, and indicating &quot;part of&quot; otherwise, the phylogeny is shown below. The Solasteridae are split from the Velatida, and the old Spinulosida is broken up.

==Human relations==

===In research===

Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, together with all other echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfish produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these can be stored in a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. &quot;Asterina pectinifera&quot;, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.

Another area of research is the ability of starfish to regenerate lost body parts. The stem cells of adult humans are incapable of much differentiation and understanding the regrowth, repair and cloning processes in starfish may have implications for human medicine.

Starfish also have an unusual ability to expel foreign objects from their bodies, which makes them difficult to tag for research tracking purposes.

===In legend and culture===
An aboriginal Australian fable retold by the Welsh school headmaster William Jenkyn Thomas (1870–1959) tells how some animals needed a canoe to cross the ocean. Whale had one but refused to lend it, so Starfish kept him busy, telling him stories and grooming him to remove parasites, while the others stole the canoe. When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, which is how Starfish still is today.

In 1900, the scholar Edward Tregear documented &quot;The Creation Song&quot;, which he describes as &quot;an ancient prayer for the dedication of a high chief&quot; of Hawaii. Among the &quot;uncreated gods&quot; described early in the song are the male Kumulipo (&quot;Creation&quot;) and the female Poele, both born in the night, a coral insect, the earthworm, and the starfish.

Georg Eberhard Rumpf&#x27;s 1705 &quot;The Ambonese Curiosity Cabinet&quot; describes the tropical varieties of &quot;Stella Marina&quot; or &quot;Bintang Laut&quot;, &quot;Sea Star&quot;, in Latin and Malay respectively, known in the waters around Ambon. He writes that the &quot;Histoire des Antilles&quot; reports that when the sea stars &quot;see thunder storms approaching, [they] grab hold of many small stones with their little legs, looking to ... hold themselves down as if with anchors&quot;.

&quot;Starfish&quot; is the title of novels by Peter Watts and Jennie Orbell, and in 2012, Alice Addison wrote a non-fiction book titled &quot;Starfish: A Year in the Life of Bereavement and Depression&quot;. &quot;The Starfish and the Spider&quot; is a 2006 business management book by Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom; its title alludes to the ability of the starfish to regenerate itself because of its decentralized nervous system, and the book suggests ways that a decentralized organisation may flourish.

In the Nickelodeon animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, the character&#x27;s best friend is a dim-witted starfish, Patrick Star.

===As food===
Starfish are widespread in the oceans, but are only occasionally used as food. There may be good reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste, and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous. Some species that prey on bivalve molluscs can transmit paralytic shellfish poisoning. Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the Indonesian archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but on the island of &quot;Huamobel&quot; the people cut them up, squeeze out the &quot;black blood&quot; and cook them with sour tamarind leaves; after resting the pieces for a day or two, they remove the outer skin and cook them in coconut milk. Starfish are sometimes eaten in China, Japan and in Micronesia.

===As collectables===
Starfish are in some cases taken from their habitat and sold to tourists as souvenirs, ornaments, curios or for display in aquariums. In particular, &quot;Oreaster reticulatus&quot;, with its easily accessed habitat and conspicuous coloration, is widely collected in the Caribbean. In the early to mid 20th century, this species was common along the coasts of the West Indies, but collection and trade have severely reduced its numbers. In the State of Florida, &quot;O. reticulatus&quot; is listed as endangered and its collection is illegal. Nevertheless, it is still sold throughout its range and beyond. A similar phenomenon exists in the Indo-Pacific for species such as &quot;Protoreaster nodosus&quot;.

===In industry and military history===
With its multiple arms, the starfish provides a popular metaphor for computer networks, companies and software tools. It is also the name of a seabed imaging system and company.

Starfish has repeatedly been chosen as a name in military history. Three ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS &quot;Starfish&quot;: an A-class destroyer launched in 1894; an R-class destroyer launched in 1916; and an S-class submarine launched in 1933 and lost in 1940. In World War II, Starfish sites were large-scale night-time decoys created during The Blitz to simulate burning British cities. Starfish Prime was a high-altitude nuclear test conducted by the United States on 9 July 1962.

<text>Nigel Ernest James Mansell (; born 8 August 1953) is a British former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Mansell won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Williams, and won 31 Grands Prix across 15 seasons. In American open-wheel racing, Mansell won the IndyCar World Series in 1993 with Newman/Haas Racing, and remains the only driver to have simultaneously held both the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and the American open-wheel National Championship.

His career in Formula One spanned 15 seasons, with his final two full seasons of top-level racing being spent in the CART series. Mansell was the reigning F1 champion when he moved to CART, becoming the first person to win the CART title in his debut season, and making him the only person to hold both the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and the American open-wheel National Championship simultaneously. Mansell is the second most successful British Formula One driver of all time in terms of race wins with 31 victories, behind Lewis Hamilton with wins, and is eighth overall on the Formula One race winners list, behind Hamilton, Michael Schumacher, Max Verstappen, Sebastian Vettel, Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Fernando Alonso. He held the record for the most pole positions set in a single season, which was broken in by Sebastian Vettel. He also remains the last Formula One driver to win a race over the age of 40, which was the 1994 Australian Grand Prix.

Mansell raced in the Grand Prix Masters series in 2005, and won the championship title. He later signed a one-off race deal for the Scuderia Ecosse GT race team to drive their number 63 Ferrari F430 GT2 car at Silverstone on 6 May 2007. He has since competed in additional sports car races with his sons Leo and Greg, including the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans, and was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Early life and career==
Nigel Ernest James Mansell was born on 8 August 1953 in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, where his parents, Eric and Joyce Mansell, ran a tea shop. He grew up in Hall Green, Birmingham. He attended Hall Green Secondary school.

Mansell had a fairly slow start to his racing career, using his own money to help work his way up the ranks. After considerable success in kart racing, he moved to the Formula Ford series to the disapproval of his father. In 1976, Mansell won six of the nine races he took part in, including his debut event at Mallory Park. He entered 42 races the following year and won 33 of them to become the 1977 British Formula Ford champion, despite suffering a broken neck in a qualifying session at Brands Hatch. Doctors told him he had been perilously close to quadriplegia, that he would be confined for six months and would never drive again. Mansell discharged himself from the hospital and returned to racing. Three weeks before the accident he had resigned from his job as an aerospace engineer, having previously sold most of his personal belongings to finance his foray into Formula Ford. Later that year he was given the chance to race a Lola T570 Formula 3 car at Silverstone. He finished fourth and decided that he was ready to move into the higher formula.

Mansell raced in Formula Three in 1978–1980. Mansell&#x27;s first season in Formula Three started with a pole position and a second-place finish. However, the car was not competitive, as a commercial deal with Unipart required his team to use Triumph Dolomite engines that were vastly inferior to the Toyota engines used by the leading teams. After three seventh-place finishes and a fourth in his last race, he parted from the team. The next season saw him drive for David Price Racing. Following a first win in the series at Silverstone in March, he went on to finish eighth in the championship. His racing was consistent, but a collision with Andrea de Cesaris resulted in a huge cartwheeling crash which he was lucky to survive. Again he was hospitalised, this time with broken vertebrae.

His driving was noticed by Colin Chapman, owner of Lotus, and shortly after his accident, hiding the extent of his injury with painkillers, Mansell performed well enough during a tryout at the Paul Ricard circuit with Lotus, where he was pitted against a number of other drivers to determine who was going to take the second seat for the 1980 season alongside Mario Andretti, as Argentine Carlos Reutemann was leaving to go to Williams. Driving a 79, the seat eventually went to Italian driver Elio de Angelis, but Mansell was selected to become a test driver for the Norfolk-based Formula One team.

==Formula One==

===1980–1984: Lotus===
;1980 and 1981
Mansell&#x27;s skill as a test driver, including setting the fastest lap around Silverstone in a Lotus car at the time, impressed Chapman enough to give him a trio of starts in F1 in , driving a development version of the Lotus 81 used by the team, the Lotus 81B. In his Formula One debut at the 1980 Austrian Grand Prix, a fuel leak in the cockpit that developed shortly before the start of the race left him with painful first and second degree burns on his buttocks. An engine failure forced him to retire from that race and his second, however an accident at his third event at Imola meant he failed to qualify. Team leader Mario Andretti wrote his car off in a start-line accident during the Canadian Grand Prix at Montreal, so Mansell had to give up his car for Andretti to compete in for his home race, the final race of the season at Watkins Glen in the United States. Andretti announced he was leaving to move to Alfa Romeo at the end of the season leaving Lotus with a vacant race seat.

Despite Mansell being unpopular with sponsor David Thieme of Essex Petroleum, and much speculation in the press that Jean-Pierre Jarier would fill the vacancy, Chapman announced at the start of the season that the seat would be filled by Mansell.

Mansell&#x27;s four years as a full-time Lotus driver were a struggle, as the cars were unreliable and he was continually out-performed by teammate Elio de Angelis. Out of 59 race starts with the team, he finished just 24 of them. He managed a best finish of third place, which he achieved five times during the four years, including Lotus&#x27;s fifth race of the season, and only the seventh of Mansell&#x27;s Formula One career. Teammate Elio de Angelis took a surprise win at the 1982 Austrian Grand Prix, and was frequently faster than his less-experienced colleague Mansell.

;1982

During the season, Mansell planned to race in the 24 Hours of Le Mans sportscar event in order to earn extra money. At the time Mansell was paid £50,000 a year and was offered £10,000 to take part in Le Mans. Chapman believed that by entering the Le Mans race, Mansell was exposing himself to unnecessary risk and paid him £10,000 not to take part in the race. Chapman extended Mansell&#x27;s contract to the end of the season in a deal that made him a millionaire.

As a result of the gestures, such as described above, Mansell became very close to Chapman, who made him equal number one in the team with de Angelis, and was devastated by Chapman&#x27;s sudden death in 1982. In his autobiography Mansell stated that when Chapman died, &quot;The bottom dropped out of my world. Part of me died with him. I had lost a member of my family.&quot; Following Chapman&#x27;s death, relationships at Lotus became strained, as replacement team principal Peter Warr did not have a high regard for him as a driver or person. Warr in his book titled &quot;Team Lotus – My View From The Pit Wall&quot; stated about the 1982 season:
&quot;After carefully analysing the season just finished, it was completely clear who was the number one. It was Elio. He was faster, he had out-qualified Nigel ten times to three. Elio had seven points scoring finishes to Nigel&#x27;s two and in addition to Elio&#x27;s win in Austria, had a tally of more than three times the number of points gained by Nigel. What is more, the margin by which Elio eclipsed his team-mate in qualifying overall was a huge 4.5 per cent. And all this in the year when, as near as can be reasonably achieved, the two drivers were given equal equipment and treatment.&quot;

;1983
De Angelis was then promoted back to outright number one for the 1983 season. This was demonstrated by the fact that he had exclusive use of the quick but unreliable Renault turbo-charged 93T for the whole season, and Mansell did not get to drive a turbocharged car until the ninth round, the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, a race where he climbed from 16th to second and eventually finished fourth in a brand-new, hastily designed 94T. Due to their tumultuous relationship and a lack of decent results, Warr was not keen on honouring the last year of the contract that Mansell had signed with Chapman. However, with encouragement from Lotus&#x27;s sponsors, John Player Special (who allegedly preferred a British driver), and with the only other remaining top British driver (Derek Warwick, after John Watson&#x27;s retirement) already confirmed to be joining the factory Renault team, it was announced Mansell would be staying with the team.

;1984

In 1984, Mansell finished in the championship top 10 for the first time, and took his first career pole position but still finished behind teammate de Angelis, who finished third, in the championship. At the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix Mansell surprised many by overtaking Alain Prost in a wet race for the lead, but soon after retired from the race after losing control on the slippery painted lines on the road surface on the run up the hill on lap 15. Late in the season, Lotus announced the recruitment of Ayrton Senna for the following year, leaving Mansell with no race seat at Lotus. After receiving offers from Arrows and Williams, and first turning down Williams&#x27;s offer, it was announced before the Dutch Grand Prix that he would indeed be joining Williams.

Mansell was remembered by many that year when he collapsed while pushing his car to the finish line after the transmission failed on the last lap of the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix. The race was one of the hottest on record, and after two hours of driving in 104 °F (about 40 °C) conditions Mansell fainted while pushing his car over the line to salvage a sixth-place finish (and thus one championship point) in a race of which he had led half, having started from pole.

In his autobiography, Mansell claimed that his final race with the Lotus team—the 1984 Portuguese Grand Prix—was heavily compromised by Warr&#x27;s unwillingness to give Mansell the brake pads he desired for the race. With 18 laps of the race remaining, and with Mansell in second position, the brakes on his car failed. On Mansell&#x27;s departure, Warr was quoted as saying &quot;He&#x27;ll never win a Grand Prix as long as I have a hole in my arse&quot;.

===1985–1988: Williams===
;1985

In Frank Williams hired Mansell to drive alongside Keke Rosberg as part of the Williams team, Mansell later saying &quot;We have the greatest respect for each other.&quot; Mansell was given the number 5 on his car, which initially was white like the 6 on Rosberg car, but was changed to red from the Canadian Grand Prix onwards, probably to help distinguish his car from Rosberg&#x27;s due to their helmets being similar. That gave birth to the &quot;Red 5&quot;, brought to the public&#x27;s attention mainly through commentator Murray Walker for the BBC, which Mansell kept carrying on subsequent Williams and Newman/Haas cars; even on the 1994 Williams, in which he would race the number 2, it would be red coloured.

Rosberg, the World Champion who was heading into his fourth season with the team, was initially against Williams signing Mansell based on the clash the pair had at Dallas the previous year (Rosberg won that race and in an interview while on the podium publicly berated Mansell&#x27;s blocking tactics while leading early in the race, which earned Rosberg a round of boos from the crowd who had appreciated Mansell&#x27;s courage in trying to push his Lotus to the finish in the extreme heat). Other factors were what Rosberg later said in a 1986 interview was second-hand information about Mansell which ultimately proved to be false. The drivers found they got along well and from early in the pre-season formed a good working and personal relationship.

1985 initially appeared to provide more of the same for Mansell, although he was closer to the pace than before, especially as the Honda engines became more competitive by mid-season.

During practice for the 1985 French Grand Prix, Mansell unwillingly broke the record for the highest speed crash in Formula One history. At the end of the Paul Ricard Circuit&#x27;s 1.8 km long Mistral Straight he went off at the fast Courbe de Signes at over in his Williams FW10. Mansell suffered a concussion, which kept him out of the race. Teammate Rosberg claimed the pole for the race and finished second behind the Brabham-BMW of Nelson Piquet.

Mansell achieved second place at the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, and followed this with his first victory in 72 starts at the European Grand Prix at Brands Hatch in England. He achieved a second straight victory at the South African Grand Prix in Kyalami. These triumphs helped turn Mansell into a Formula One star.

;1986
Going into , the Williams-Honda team had a car, the FW11 which was capable of winning regularly, and Mansell had a new confidence that led to establishing himself as a potential World Championship contender. He also had a new teammate in twice World Champion Nelson Piquet who had joined Williams looking to be a regular winner and contender again after the Brabham-BMWs had become increasingly unreliable and uncompetitive. The Brazilian publicly described Mansell as &quot;an uneducated blockhead&quot; and had also criticised Mansell&#x27;s wife Roseanne&#x27;s looks, later retracting these statements following threats of legal action.

Mansell won five Grand Prix in 1986 and also played a part in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history, finishing second to Ayrton Senna in the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez by a mere 0.014 seconds (Mansell later jokingly said they should give himself and Senna 7½ points each). The 1986 season was led mostly by Mansell in championship points, and it went down to the wire in Adelaide, Australia for the Australian Grand Prix with Prost, Piquet and Mansell all still in contention for the title. The equation was simple, Prost and Piquet needed to win and have Mansell finish no higher than fourth. After aiming for a third-place finish which would guarantee him the title, Mansell would narrowly miss out on winning it after his left-rear tyre exploded in spectacular fashion on the main straight with only 19 laps of the race to go. In a 2012 interview for Sky Sports Legends of F1 Mansell revealed that, had he hit the wall rather than wrestling the car safely to a halt in the run-off area at the end of the straight, the stewards would most likely have red flagged the race. As the race was over two thirds distance, he would have kept his position and won his first F1 world title. Instead Mansell ended the season as runner-up to Alain Prost. His efforts in 1986 led to his being voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

1986 proved to be a tough year for both Mansell and the Williams team, off the track at least. After a pre-season test session at the Paul Ricard Circuit in the south of France, team owner Frank Williams was involved in a horrific road accident which left him a tetraplegic. Williams would not return to the scene until making a surprise appearance at the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch where Mansell and Piquet finished 1–2. Williams&#x27;s absence from the day-to-day running of the team actually created tension between the team and engine supplier Honda. The Japanese giant regarded dual World Champion Nelson Piquet as the team&#x27;s number one driver (they were reportedly paying the bulk of Piquet&#x27;s multimillion-dollar retainer) and were reportedly unhappy that the team&#x27;s co-owner and Technical Director Patrick Head did not rein in Mansell during races and allowed him to take both points and wins from Piquet. As it was, while Williams dominated the Constructors&#x27; Championship, the two drivers took enough points from each other to allow McLaren&#x27;s Alain Prost to sneak through and win the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Before the season had started Honda had reportedly attempted to persuade Frank Williams to replace Mansell with their own test driver Satoru Nakajima. Williams, who was always more interested in the Constructors&#x27; title than the Drivers&#x27; as it showed that his team was the best, refused to do this, rightly believing that having two proven F1 winners in Piquet and Mansell would better-serve the team than Nakajima would as an F1 rookie.

;1987
Six more wins followed in , including an emotional and hugely popular victory at Silverstone for the British Grand Prix in which he came back from 28 seconds behind in 30 laps to beat teammate Piquet, with his car running out of fuel on the slowing down lap. A serious qualifying accident at Suzuka in Japan for the penultimate race of the season severely injured Mansell&#x27;s back (a spinal concussion). Trying to beat Piquet&#x27;s lap time, Mansell made a mistake and hit the guardrail. As a result of Mansell&#x27;s absence from the remaining two races, Piquet became champion for the third time. Piquet called his win over Mansell &quot;a win of intelligence over stupidity&quot;. The Brazilian also added that he won because he was more consistent than his teammate, racking up points and podiums where Mansell often ran into trouble. Piquet&#x27;s was a percentage driving policy which worked well in the ultra-competitive Williams-Honda, whereas Mansell was a hard charger who many felt often pushed his luck too far.

;1988

In , for the first time in his career, Mansell was a team&#x27;s first driver, having won more races in the previous two seasons than any other driver. However, Williams lost the turbo power of Honda to McLaren, and had to settle with a naturally aspirated Judd V8 engine in its first season in F1. A dismal season followed, which saw Mansell&#x27;s Williams team experiment with a terribly unreliable (but extremely innovative) active suspension system (the system had worked well when introduced by the team in 1987 where it could draw on approximately 5% of the reported produced by the Honda turbo, but struggled with the Judd V8). Mansell would complete only two of the 14 races in which he appeared in 1988, both being podium finishes. One of these was a second place at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone where, overnight, the team had stopped using its active suspension (after months of Patrick Head telling Mansell and teammate Riccardo Patrese that it would take many months of work to do so), and reverted to a passive suspension set-up.

Mansell contracted chickenpox in the summer of 1988 and after a competitive (but ill-advised) drive in the very hot conditions of the 1988 Hungarian Grand Prix the illness became worse, forcing him to miss the next two Grands Prix in Belgium where he was replaced by Martin Brundle, and Italy where he was replaced by Frenchman Jean-Louis Schlesser. By missing the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Mansell missed the traditional welcome by the Tifosi for a newly signed Ferrari driver after he had announced he would be leaving Williams to join the Maranello-based team for .

===1989–1990: Ferrari===

;1989
In preparation for the season, Mansell became the last Ferrari driver to be personally selected by Enzo Ferrari before his death in August 1988, an honour Mansell described as &quot;one of the greatest in my entire career&quot;. Enzo Ferrari presented a 1989 Ferrari F40 as a gift to Mansell. In Italy he became known as &quot;il leone&quot; (&quot;the lion&quot;) by the &quot;tifosi&quot; because of his fearless driving style. The season was one of change in the sport, with the banning of turbo engines by the FIA and the introduction of the electronically controlled semi-automatic transmission by Ferrari.

Mansell believed that 1989 would be a development year and that he would be able to challenge for the championship the following season. In his first appearance with the team he scored a very unlikely win in the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix at the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet in Rio de Janeiro; his least favourite track, and the home race of his bitter rival Piquet. He later joked that he had booked an early flight home for halfway through the race as he predicted the car&#x27;s new electronic gearbox would last only a few laps (as it had done throughout pre-season testing and in qualifying for the race). Mansell became the first driver to win a race in a car with a semi-automatic gearbox. The race saw him as the first driver to win in their debut race for the Scuderia since Mario Andretti had won the 1971 South African Grand Prix and he would remain the last man to win on his Ferrari debut until Kimi Räikkönen won the 2007 Australian Grand Prix.

The rest of 1989 was characterised by gearbox and various other problems, including a disqualification at the Canadian Grand Prix and a black-flagged incident at the Portuguese Grand Prix for reversing in the pit lane, which resulted in a ban for the next race in Spain. However, Mansell finished fourth in the Championship with the help of a second win for Ferrari at the tight and twisty Hungaroring for the Hungarian Grand Prix. Early in practice Mansell had seen that trying to qualify the car high on the grid was a pointless exercise and he decided instead to concentrate on a good race set-up. After qualifying 12th (0.681s behind teammate Gerhard Berger in sixth and 2.225s behind pole man Riccardo Patrese in his Williams-Renault) and not even being considered a chance for the race, he charged his way through the field until he pulled off a sensational passing manoeuvre on the McLaren-Honda of World Champion Ayrton Senna on lap 58 to take a lead he would not lose.

;1990
A tough followed with Ferrari, in which his car suffered more reliability problems, forcing him to retire from seven races. He was paired with Alain Prost, (who was also the reigning World Champion), and who took over as the team&#x27;s lead driver. Mansell recalls one incident where at the 1990 British Grand Prix, the car he drove did not handle the same as in the previous race where he had taken pole position. On confronting the mechanics, it transpired that Prost saw Mansell as having a superior car and as a result, they were swapped without telling Mansell. After retiring from the race, he announced he was retiring from the sport altogether at the end of the season. This, combined with the fact that Frenchman Prost was not only a triple World Champion and the winner of more Grands Prix than anyone in history, but also spoke fluent Italian, whereas Mansell&#x27;s Italian was only conversational at best, gave Prost greater influence within the Maranello-based team. According to Prost, Mansell only attended two or three mechanical briefings throughout the season, preferring playing golf. One notable highlight of the season was a daring pass on Gerhard Berger around the daunting high speed Peraltada corner that was later renamed in his honour. Approaching the corner for the penultimate time Mansell was bobbing from side to side in Berger&#x27;s mirrors. Heading into one of the quickest corners on the calendar at the time, where the Ferraris had registered forces of 4.7g during practice, Mansell launched to the outside of Berger and flashed past to take second place.

Mansell scored only a single win, at the 1990 Portuguese Grand Prix, finished a thrilling second to Nelson Piquet in Australia and finished fifth in the World Championship. Mansell then announced his retirement from Formula One.

===1991–1992: Return to Williams===
;1991

Mansell&#x27;s retirement plans were halted when Frank Williams stepped in. Mansell&#x27;s return to Williams was not straightforward. He would agree to return only if a list of demands were met, including undisputed number one status over Riccardo Patrese (who had remained with the team through 1989 and 1990), guarantees of support in a wide variety of areas with each guarantee in writing, and assurances from suppliers such as Renault and Elf that they would do everything necessary to help him win. Frank Williams said the demands were &#x27;impossible&#x27;; Mansell concluded that if that were the case he would be happy to retire. Three weeks later the impossible had happened and Mansell was a Williams driver. Williams signed Mansell on 1 October 1990 after Mansell was assured the contract stated that he would be the focus of the team, having experienced being the &#x27;Number Two&#x27; driver at Ferrari. Mansell would be paid £4.6 million a season, a deal which made him the highest paid British sportsman at the time.

His second stint with Williams was even better than the first. Back in the familiar &#x27;Red 5&#x27;, he won five races in , including the Spanish Grand Prix. In this race he went wheel-to-wheel with Ayrton Senna, with only centimetres to spare, at over on the main straight. Quite a different spectacle was offered following Mansell&#x27;s victory in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Senna&#x27;s car had stopped on the final lap, but, rather than leave his rival stranded out on the circuit (the two had come to blows in the pits following their first lap tangle during the 1987 Belgian Grand Prix and were hardly close friends), Mansell pulled over on his victory lap and allowed Senna to ride on the Williams sidepod back to the pits.

The Williams team&#x27;s decision to develop their new semi-automatic gearbox by racing with it at the start of the season was at the cost of points in the opening rounds of the championship. Senna was on 40 points with four straight wins to open the season by the time Mansell gained his first finish with a second in Monaco. Mansell then had the next race in Canada practically won when his Williams FW14 stopped half a lap from the finish with what was reported to be transmission failure, though it was claimed by designer Adrian Newey that Mansell had let his engine revs drop too low while he was waving to the crowd in celebration and stalled his engine. This handed Nelson Piquet his 23rd and last F1 race win. Despite a good mid-season, which included a hat-trick of victories, Senna&#x27;s consistency and Mansell&#x27;s retirements at key races meant that he finished second in the Championship for the third time in his career, this time behind Senna.

;1992 - Formula One World Champion
Mansell started the season with five straight victories (a record not equalled until Michael Schumacher in ). At the sixth round of the season in Monaco, he took pole and dominated much of the race. However, with seven laps remaining, Mansell suffered a loose wheel nut and was forced into the pits, emerging behind Ayrton Senna&#x27;s McLaren-Honda. Mansell, on fresh tyres, set a lap record almost two seconds quicker than Senna&#x27;s and closed from 5.2 to 1.9 seconds in only two laps. The pair duelled around Monaco for the final four laps but Mansell could find no way past, finishing just 0.2 seconds behind the Brazilian. Mansell broke the record for most wins by a British driver of all time when he won the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, as he surpassed Jackie Stewart&#x27;s record of 27 wins with his 28th. Mansell was finally crowned Formula One World Champion at the age of 39 early in the season at the Hungarian Grand Prix, the 11th round of that season, where his second-place finish clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship, securing the title in the fewest Grands Prix since the 16-race season format started. Mansell also set the then-record for the most wins in one season (9); both records stood until broken by Schumacher in 2002. He managed 14 pole positions that year at the Brazilian Grand Prix on 26 November, a record only broken by Sebastian Vettel in 2011. He also held the record for the most races before becoming World Champion with 180 races; this record was broken by Nico Rosberg in 2016 with 206 races.

Other Formula One records set in 1992 that he still holds are the highest percentage of pole positions in a season (88%), most Grand Prix wins before becoming World Champion (29), and most runner-up championship finishes before becoming World Champion (three). Mansell also holds the record for most DNFs from Grands Prix where a driver started from pole and scored the fastest lap, at four (1987 German Grand Prix, 1990 British Grand Prix, 1992 Japanese Grand Prix, and 1992 Italian Grand Prix). Mansell is also the driver with the most wins (31) among those who never won at Monaco.

He won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award again in 1992, one of only four people to have won the award twice.

During this season, Mansell gained a reputation for a psychological competitiveness and mind games. After the announcement by the FIA that the organization would be weighing drivers, Mansell, known for ignoring diet, starved and dehydrated himself the day prior to weigh-ins. This measure led to Mansell weighing less than his teammate Riccardo Patrese by half a kilogram.

==CART IndyCar World Series==

Whilst being world champion, Mansell had a public disagreement with Williams. In his autobiography Mansell writes that this was because of a deal made at the previous Hungarian Grand Prix, which Williams reneged on, and the prospect of his former teammate Alain Prost, who had sat out the 1992 season, joining the Renault-powered team.

Mansell&#x27;s contract was due to expire at the end of the season. According to Patrick Head, Mansell pushed for a contract extension to be agreed early in the season. Despite this being unusual for the team, Mansell&#x27;s perseverance purportedly paid off, and met with both Frank Williams and Patrick Head at the Williams Motorhome in Jerez, where they discussed and subsequently shook hands on a deal for a further two seasons (1993 and 1994). They followed this up with a written contract sent to Mansell&#x27;s home address in the Isle of Man for final review and signature. According to Head, Mansell procrastinated on returning the signed agreement however, whilst winning back-to-back races over the upcoming months, finally resulting in Mansell asking for more money, which infuriated and frustrated the Williams leadership team.

According to Mansell, Williams had initially neglected to tell him that Prost had signed for 1993 at only the second race of the 1992 season in Mexico, a position that Mansell felt would be similar to their days together at Ferrari in 1990. To boot, Ayrton Senna had expressed a strong desire to drive for Williams and even offered to drive for them at no salary (only to later be rebuffed as Prost, whose rivalry with the Brazilian was more intense as the one he had with Mansell, had a clause written into his contract which enabled him to block Senna&#x27;s effort). Williams decided that there was little sense in paying the high fees Mansell went on to demand, and told him that he needed to sign on the original deal or Senna was ready to be signed instead. When Mansell discovered this to be untrue and a ruse, he decided to move on and called a press conference to announce his retirement. An 11th hour offer was made to him at the Italian Grand Prix, but by then the damage was done - Mansell retired from F1.

Mansell then signed with Newman/Haas Racing to pair with Mario Andretti in the CART series, replacing Mario&#x27;s son Michael who moved to F1 and McLaren. At the season opener in Surfers Paradise, Australia, he became the first &quot;rookie&quot; to take pole position and win his first race. A few weeks later he suffered a substantial crash at the Phoenix International Raceway, severely injuring his back. At the 1993 Indianapolis 500, Mansell would lead the race only to finish third after losing the lead to Emerson Fittipaldi and Arie Luyendyk after a poor restart. On his 40th birthday Mansell would avenge his loss at Indianapolis to score a 200-mile race victory at New Hampshire International Speedway, perhaps his most exciting CART victory. He would go on to score five wins in the 1993 CART season, which, with more high-placed finishes, was good enough to earn him the championship. This enabled Mansell to become the only driver in history to hold both the Formula One and CART championships at the same time; when he won the 1993 CART championship he was still the reigning F1 world champion, the 1993 F1 championship not yet having been decided.
Following this successful season in CART, Mansell received several awards, including a Gold Medal from the Royal Automobile Club and the 1994 ESPY Award for Best Driver.

His Newman/Haas car was much less reliable the following year, 1994, and results suffered. Mansell was also the catalyst for the breakdown in the relationship between himself and Mario Andretti. Andretti has since remarked &quot;I guess if Ronnie Peterson was the best team-mate I ever had, Nigel Mansell was the worst&quot; and &quot;I had a lot of respect for him as a driver, but not as a man&quot;.

==Brief return to Formula One==
===1994: Williams===
In , after the CART season ended, Mansell returned to F1 and re-joined the Williams team. Since he had left it in 1992, the team had undergone some significant changes. Damon Hill had been promoted from test driver and was running full-time in one car. Prost, Mansell&#x27;s replacement, won the 1993 Drivers&#x27; Championship and then retired after the season. This allowed Williams and Ayrton Senna to finally work out an agreement, and the team received a new sponsor in Rothmans International for a season in which they were expected to remain as champions. However, the car proved unreliable and tricky to handle early in the season, leading Senna to retire from the opening rounds despite claiming pole. In the third race at Imola, Senna was killed in a crash at the Tamburello curve.

Williams test driver David Coulthard took over Senna&#x27;s seat for the majority of 1994 and Williams got permission from Newman/Haas Racing to bring back Mansell at the French Grand Prix and the final three races of 1994 in Europe, Japan and Australia. Mansell was paid approximately £900,000 per race, compared to teammate Damon Hill being paid £300,000 for the entire season. Mansell&#x27;s return was helped by Bernie Ecclestone helping unravel his contracts in the United States. It was important for F1 to have a world champion driving that season and with worldwide TV viewing figures starting to decline, they needed Mansell. The 41-year-old was not as quick as Hill in race trim but signs that his speeds were coming back were evident in Japan during a battle with the Ferrari of Jean Alesi. Mansell took his final Grand Prix victory in Adelaide, the last race of the season, having out-qualified the two title contenders at the time, Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher, in the process (helped out by the second qualifying session being held on a wet track, with the times from the first session making up the grid). The plan initially was for Mansell to protect Hill from Schumacher, but both drivers passed him at the start and eventually collided (causing the retirement of both), handing Schumacher his first world title.

Mansell purportedly agreed a new contract to drive for Williams again in 1995, but later claimed this was rescinded. Williams ultimately opted for youth over experience and hired Coulthard for the 1995 season.

===1995: McLaren===

After losing the Williams seat to David Coulthard, Mansell signed to drive for McLaren in .

McLaren&#x27;s title sponsors Marlboro wanted a world champion, whereas McLaren and their engine suppliers Mercedes wanted a lower-profile driver for what was Mercedes&#x27; second year back in Formula One since abandoning it in .

Before the season started, Mansell could not fit into the narrow car and was deputised by Mark Blundell for the opening two rounds in Brazil and Argentina. Mansell&#x27;s car was completed in 33 days and in time for Imola, where despite being in the top six late in the race, a clash with Eddie Irvine saw him finish 10th and out of the points. The Spanish Grand Prix saw Mansell become frustrated over his car&#x27;s handling characteristics. He chose to retire after just two races with the team. Mansell cited the decision to retire as his not wanting to make up the numbers and with no hope of the McLaren MP4/10 being competitive. In 2015, Mansell stated that he was wrong to leave McLaren so soon and that in hindsight he should have continued with the team for the season and help improve the car.

===1997: Jordan potential comeback===

A few testing sessions with F1 teams including Jordan suggested another comeback could be on the cards, but it never happened. Reports at the time suggested that the Mansell–Jordan partnership for 1997 was a real possibility with Eddie Jordan&#x27;s title sponsor willing to pay for the deal. The Jordan team said after the tests in Barcelona in December 1996 that Mansell decided against it.

==British Touring Car Championship==

Mansell took part in the 1993 TOCA Shootout, held at Donington Park. Mansell drove a Ford Mondeo with his usual red number 5. The race ended in disaster for Mansell; he was knocked unconscious following a crash with six laps remaining. He lost control of his car through the exit of the Old Hairpin, over-corrected the slide and collided with Tiff Needell&#x27;s Vauxhall Cavalier, resulting in a spin and a bad crash into the concrete wall under the bridge.Mansell made a return to racing in 1998 in the British Touring Car Championship, driving in a Ford Mondeo for three rounds. With the number 5 already taken by James Thompson, Mansell raced with the red number 55.

At his first event at Donington Park, he retired three laps into the sprint race, meaning he would start the feature race in 19th position on the grid. As the conditions changed and the track became wetter, Mansell found himself leading the race for several laps, and he finished in fifth position. The race was regarded by many fans as one of the greatest in touring car history.

It was to be his best finish in the series, as he failed to finish either race at the next round he participated in at Brands Hatch, and at his final race at Silverstone he finished in 14th and 11th place. Having competed in three of the 13 rounds, he finished 18th out of 21 in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

==Subsequent appearances==

On 16 July 2005, Mansell took part in a &quot;Race of Legends&quot; exhibition event at the Norisring round of the DTM. He competed against other Formula One World Champions Jody Scheckter, Alain Prost and Emerson Fittipaldi, as well as Motorcycle Grand Prix World Champions Mick Doohan and Johnny Cecotto (himself a former F1 driver), each driver having an opportunity to drive Audi, Mercedes and Opel cars. Prost was announced as the winner by the DTM organisers.

Mansell became a financial stakeholder and a driver in the new Grand Prix Masters series. Following a period of testing and developing the car, Mansell made a successful race comeback by winning the inaugural race of the series in Kyalami in November 2005 (Mansell had won at the old Kyalami circuit in 1985 and had also won at the new circuit in 1992). After the success of the race at Kyalami, four dates were scheduled for the GP Masters Series in 2006, including one at Silverstone. Mansell won the season opener at Qatar in April from pole position. The Monza round of the series was cancelled due to noise limitations at the venue, whilst technical issues quickly ruled him out of the Silverstone race.

Also in 2006 he appeared at Brands Hatch, scene of his first Grand Prix win, in October 1985, driving some demonstration laps in the BMW M3 GTR that Andy Priaulx drove to victory in the 2005 24 Hours Nürburgring, as part of the World Touring Car Championship event.

On the weekend of 6 May 2007 he made an appearance in the second round of the FIA GT Championship at Silverstone driving a Ferrari 430 GT2 for the Scuderia Ecosse team. He was paired with Chris Niarchos, finishing seventh in class and 21st overall.

Mansell, with his son Leo, tested a Chamberlain-Synergy team Le Mans prototype Lola-AER B06/10 during the week commencing 14 July 2008, at the Estoril circuit. The pair were said to be considering a drive in the American Le Mans series, possibly commencing as soon as October 2008 in the Petit Le Mans event, although neither driver was in the final field.

On 3 July 2009, Mansell tested his other son Greg&#x27;s World Series by Renault car at the Silverstone Circuit, setting a best time six seconds off the pace of the fastest driver in the session.

Mansell took part in the last round of the 2009 Le Mans Series, the 1000 km of Silverstone, driving Team LNT&#x27;s Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S alongside his son Greg and team boss Lawrence Tomlinson.

Mansell raced a Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S in the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans, alongside his two sons. According to the BBC, this was the first time a father has raced at Le Mans in the same car as his two sons. However, in the race he crashed after only five laps, following a tyre puncture. Reports at the time indicated that he had suffered a concussion, but Mansell later revealed that the accident left him unable to talk or recognise his wife and children. To recover, he took up magic in order to “get [his] brain to work in different ways.” Since taking up the hobby, Mansell has become a member of the Magic Circle and gone on to perform around the world, as he explained in a special video interview to mark 30 years since his F1 world-title win in 2022.

For the 2010 Formula One season, the Sporting Regulations were changed so that a former driver sits on the stewards&#x27; panel. Mansell took this role at the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 British Grands Prix.
Also Monaco GP 2012, US GP 2013, Brazil GP 2015.

===Biographies===
Mansell has written several autobiographies and books on racing in general:
*&quot;In the Driving Seat&quot; (1989) (with Derick Allsop)
*&quot;Driven to Win&quot; (1990)
*&quot;Mansell and Williams: Challenge for the Championship&quot; (1991)
*&quot;Indycar Racing&quot; (1993) (with Jeremy Shaw)
*&quot;My Story&quot; (1995) (with James Allen)
*&quot;Staying on Track&quot; (2015)

==Television and video games==
Mansell participated in Prince Edward&#x27;s charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; (1987).

There were three video games endorsed by Mansell: &quot;Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Grand Prix&quot; (1988, Martech), &quot;Nigel Mansell&#x27;s World Championship Racing&quot; (1993, Gremlin Graphics), and &quot;Newman/Haas IndyCar&quot; (1994). Mansell also appeared as a playable driver for Williams in Codemasters&#x27; &quot;F1 2013&quot;.

A wax figure of Mansell was &quot;stolen&quot; from a museum in Poland by the crew of the Amazon show &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; in season 5 episode 2 &quot;Eurocrash&quot; (2023) and subsequently joined the host trio on their road trip across central Europe.

==Personal life==

Mansell married his wife, Roseanne, on 19 April 1975, after having met as college students.

He lived in Port Erin on the Isle of Man during most of his F1 career until 1995. Mansell currently lives in Jersey, Channel Islands. He spent 11 years of his life as a Special Constable on the Isle of Man during his driving career, and in Devon after he retired from racing. During this period, he also developed a golf course in Devon.

A keen golfer, Mansell revealed a desire to compete in The Open Championship and briefly participated in the 1988 Australian Open. In the late 1980s he bought a sports car dealership in Pimperne in Dorset, naming it Nigel Mansell Sports Cars Ltd.

Mansell was the owner of the Team UK Youth cycling team.

His sons Leo and Greg are also former racing drivers.

In addition to the aforementioned Ferrari F40, Mansell has also owned a bronze left-hand drive 1988 Mercedes-Benz (C126) 560SEC that he used to travel to races in Europe and later sold to art critic Brian Sewell, and a red 1984 Audi Quattro.

===&quot;Red 5&quot;===
Although teams in motor racing series are generally allocated numbers, Mansell has been associated with the number 5 for many years. This began when he joined Williams in 1985 and was allocated car number 5, as at the time Formula One racing numbers were allocated by constructor and Williams received numbers 5 and 6. For the first four races of the 1985 season, both Williams cars had white numbers, but from a distance the numerals &quot;5&quot; and &quot;6&quot; resembled each other. As a consequence, it was decided to give Mansell&#x27;s car a red number to make it more distinctive. While this was initially just for recognition, BBC F1 commentator Murray Walker began describing Mansell&#x27;s car as &quot;Red Five&quot;, leading to Mansell retaining the red coloured number throughout his first spell at Williams. On his return to the team in 1991, Williams had retained the number 5 car, allowing Mansell to race as &quot;Red Five&quot; once again. After his departure to CART in 1993 to drive for Newman/Haas, he again ran the red number 5 after Newman Hass made a deal to acquire it from Penske (it had been Emerson Fittipaldi&#x27;s race number since 1991). In addition, &quot;Red Five&quot; fitted well into the livery of his Indy car, as Newman Haas&#x27;s main sponsors Texaco and Kmart both shared corporate colors of black, white and red. When he returned to Williams for four races in 1994 the team&#x27;s numbers were 0 and 2 as they had won the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; titles in 1993 but could not run #1 as Alain Prost had retired. Damon Hill drove car #0 while Mansell raced the #2 with the number on the nose of the car painted red (the #2 was white when the car was driven by Ayrton Senna and David Coulthard). So associated with the red 5 is Mansell that, in 2004, he purchased a yacht from Sunseeker, one of his longtime sponsors, which he named &quot;Red 5&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
Mansell was awarded the title of BBC Sports Personality of the Year in both 1986 and 1992. Only four other people have won the award more than once, including fellow racing drivers and former F1 World Champions Damon Hill and Lewis Hamilton. Mansell was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2005. Mansell won the Hawthorn Memorial Trophy, an award for the leading British or Commonwealth driver in F1 each year seven times.

Already an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), Mansell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to children and young people (as president of UK Youth). He has also received the Special Constabulary Long Service Medal. 
In 2015 turn 17 of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodríguez was renamed in honour of Mansell, twice winner of the Mexican Grand Prix (1987 and 1992). He received The London Classic Car Show Icon Award in 2018.

He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2006.

<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics, an association football tournament was contested for the first time. Only two matches were held between the three club sides, and no medals were awarded.

France&#x27;s representatives were determined by the USFSA, which elected the Parisian champion Club Français. For Belgium, after Racing Club de Bruxelles declined to participate, a student selection with players from the Université libre de Bruxelles was sent by the Federation. The team was reinforced with a few non-students. On the other hand, English club Upton Park F.C. represented Great Britain.

The International Olympic Committee credits Great Britain, France and a &quot;Mixed Team&quot; with gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively, as part of its attempt to reconcile early Olympic Games with the modern award scheme. The Belgian team included one British and one Dutch player.

The football matches were held at the Vélodrome de Vincennes in Paris.

==Competition schedule==
Originally there were four matches scheduled for the 1900 Olympics, all including a French team. As Switzerland and Germany eventually did not send a team, the match involving France and England was moved forward to 20 September.

In the first game, the British squad had little difficulty defeating the Club Français (wearing the USFSA uniform). Upton Park led 2–0 after the first half, getting two more goals in the second to win 4–0. Gaston Peltier scored in the first minute to give the USFSA XI an early lead, but Université de Bruxelles scored twice to take a 2–1 first half lead. The French scored five goals in the second half, however, to take the match 6–2.

<doc id="228619" wikidata="Q5467460" url="?curid=228619" title="Force Research Unit">
<text>The Force Research Unit (FRU) was a covert military intelligence unit of the British Army&#x27;s Intelligence Corps. It was established in 1980 during the Troubles to obtain intelligence from terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland by recruiting and running agents and informants. From 1987 to 1991, it was commanded by Gordon Kerr. The FRU was renamed to the [[Joint Support Group]] (JSG) following the Stevens Inquiries into allegations of collusion between the security forces and Protestant paramilitary groups. The FRU was found to have colluded with loyalist paramilitaries by the Stevens Inquiries. This has been confirmed by some former members of the unit.

==Overview==
Although the exact size of the unit was classified, former FRU operator Martin Ingram revealed in an interview that it consisted of 42 agent handlers and 26 support staff in the late 1980s. According to Ingram, their locations and staffing levels were:


The Force Research Unit worked alongside existing intelligence agencies including the Special Branch of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and MI5. In 1988, the All-Source Intelligence Cell was formed to improve the sharing of intelligence between the FRU, Special Branch and MI5. FRU operators were armed with cutting edge Heckler &amp; Koch weapons normally reserved for elite counter terrorist units, such as the MP5K compact submachine gun and the HK53 carbine assault rifle. FRU operators worked closely on missions with elite units such as the Special Air Service and the 14th Intelligence Company, who were based out of a secure area of Aldergrove Flying Station at the time. They were also granted special privileges in the course of their work, such as the power to overrule senior officers in ordering an area to be cleared of regular security force patrols or by requesting immediate helicopter cover. The FRU likewise had the power to designate specific properties as &quot;off limits&quot; to RUC searches in order to protect agents or the intelligence documents the agents were in control of. 

The British government has previously attempted to stop information about the FRU from becoming public, such as obtaining an injunction against The Sunday Times and arresting former FRU operatives who went public under suspicion of breaching the Official Secrets Act. Unsuccessful attempts were also made by an unknown &quot;British Intelligence Agency&quot; to pressure the ISP of the US based Cryptome website into removing an article naming former FRU operatives. In a 2000 interview with the Sunday Herald, an unnamed FRU operator denied accusations that they were a rouge unit, asserting that there was an unbroken chain of command from the agents on the ground all the way up to the highest levels of the Conservative Party-led government of the day (and ultimately Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher).


== List of former Force Research Unit personnel ==
Notable individuals who reportedly served in the Force Research Unit include:
* Colin Parr
* Peter Everson
* Gordon Kerr (a.k.a Colonel &#x27;J&#x27;)
* George Victor Williams 
* Ian Hurst (a.k.a Martin Ingram)
* Margaret Walshaw BEM 
* Peter Charles Jones 
* David Moyles
* Philip Campbell-Smith (a.k.a Rob Lewis)
* Ronnie Anderson

== Covert agent handling ==
Agent handling by the FRU was primarily carried out via face-to-face meetings on a near weekly basis. Telephone contacts were discouraged, unless an urgent matter arose, as an agent could be overheard by family members using their house phone and the frequent use of phone boxes would raise suspicion. 

Face-to-face meetings were tape-recorded and then transcribed on a Contact Form, after which the contents of the audio tape was erased. A copy of the Contact Form would be sent to FRU headquarters in Lisburn, who would then share any relative information with the RUC. A typical Contact Form consisted of the following sections:


== Collusion with loyalist paramilitaries ==

In the mid 1980s, the FRU recruited Brian Nelson as a double agent inside the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), and helped him to become the UDA&#x27;s chief intelligence officer. Until it was proscribed in 1992, the UDA was a legal Ulster loyalist paramilitary group that had been involved in hundreds of attacks on Catholic and nationalist civilians as well as against republican paramilitaries. In the summer of 1985, Nelson traveled to South Africa in an unsuccessful attempt to procure weapons and debriefed his FRU handlers on his return. Nelson was also allegedly involved in the 1988 Ulster Resistance weapons importation from South Africa.

Through Nelson, the Force Research Unit helped the UDA to target people for assassination. In a March 2001 article for the Andersonstown News, Martin Ingram claimed that when Brian Nelson was appointed the UDA&#x27;s intelligence chief in 1987, he handed over their entire cache of targeting files to the FRU, who then updated them with information taken from RUC Special Branch and Military Intelligence files before handing them back to Nelson for use in the planning of assassinations. In 1998, The Sunday Telegraph published a series of articles detailing the activities of the FRU and Brian Nelson&#x27;s interactions with the unit. Secret documents examined by the newspaper suggested that the specific purpose of running Nelson in the UDA was to ensure that the Loyalist paramilitaries he sourced intelligence for would target only target people actively involved in Republican
terrorism, instead of indiscriminately murdering Catholics at random. Evidence showed that Nelson was involved in at least 15 murders, 15 attempted murders, and 62 conspiracies
to murder during his time as an FRU agent. 

In a 2000 interview with the Sunday Herald, an unnamed FRU operator identified Margaret Walshaw as being Nelson&#x27;s primary FRU handler between 1986 and 1990, and accused her of colluding with him by sourcing maps, photos, and personal details of people to be targeted for assassination. The article further alleged that Walshaw even bought Nelson a personal computer so that information could be more effectively passed to him in floppy disk format, and the chances of him being arrested with incriminating documents could be reduced. Walshaw was also accused of failing to prevent murders she had advanced knowledge of, such as when Brian Robinson shot Patrick McKenna in a random attack. According to the source, Walshaw left Ireland in 1990 to become an FRU instructor with the Intelligence Corps.

In 2003, the BBC reported that FRU commanders aimed to make the UDA &quot;more professional&quot; by helping it to target and kill republican activists and prevent it from killing uninvolved Catholic civilians. If someone was under threat, agents like Nelson were to inform the FRU who were then to alert the police. Gordon Kerr, who ran the FRU from 1987 to 1991, claimed Nelson and the FRU saved over 200 lives in this way, and testified on Nelson&#x27;s behalf for mitigation during his 1992 trial under the alias &quot;Colonel J&quot;. Kerr defended the actions of the FRU regarding Nelson by asserting that the planning phase of assassinating a known PIRA activist took much longer than the usual ad hoc shooting of a random Catholic, which therefore allowed the FRU to warn RUC Special Branch to prepare &quot;counter-measures&quot;, such as increasing the level of security forces in the area of the target&#x27;s home. Kerr claimed that 730 intelligence reports had been forwarded to Special Branch in this manner, that identified threats to 217 individuals.

However, the Stevens Inquiries found evidence that only two lives were saved and said many loyalist attacks could have been prevented but were allowed to go ahead. The Stevens team believes that Nelson was responsible for at least 30 murders and many other attacks, including most prominently solicitor Pat Finucane, and that many of the victims were uninvolved civilians. The Cory Collusion Inquiry and a separate inquiry by Sir Desmond de Silva both also discovered evidence of collusion between the Brian Nelson and the FRU in the murder of Patrick Finucane. Although Nelson was imprisoned in 1992, FRU intelligence continued to help the UDA and other loyalist groups. From 1992 to 1994, loyalists were responsible for more deaths than republicans for the first time since the 1960s.

Allegations exist that the FRU sought &quot;restriction orders&quot;, a de-confliction agreement to restrict patrolling or surveillance in an area over a specified period, in advance of a number of loyalist paramilitary attacks in order to facilitate easy access to and escape from their target. This de-confliction activity was carried out at a weekly Tasking and Co-ordination Group which included representatives of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, MI5 and the British Army. It is claimed the FRU asked for restriction orders to be placed on areas where they knew loyalist paramilitaries were going to attack.

In a February 2025 podcast series for The Telegraph, former FRU operator Martin Ingram accused his former commanding officer at the Force Research Unit, Gordon Kerr, of being a proud Scottish Loyalist who let his own bigotry towards Irish Catholics cloud his judgement. Ingram also accused a former FRU colleague named Margaret Walshaw, who was Brian Nelson&#x27;s handler, of passing information (such as photographs and vehicle registration numbers) to Nelson to help plan assassinations.

==Alleged infiltration of republican paramilitary groups==
FRU are also alleged to have handled agents within republican paramilitary groups. A number of agents are suspected to have been handled by the FRU including IRA units who planted bombs and assassinated. Attacks are said to have taken place involving FRU-controlled agents highly placed within the IRA.

It is suspected that the FRU sought to influence the IRA primarily through an agent codenamed &quot;Stakeknife&quot;, thought to have been a member of the IRA&#x27;s Internal Security Unit (a unit responsible for counter-intelligence, interrogation and court martial of informers within the IRA). There is a debate as to whether this agent was IRA member Freddie Scappaticci or another, as of yet unidentified, IRA member. It is believed that &quot;Stakeknife&quot; was used by the FRU to influence the outcome of investigations conducted by the IRA&#x27;s Internal Security Unit into the activities of IRA volunteers.

It is alleged that, in 1987, the UDA came into possession of details relating to the identity of the FRU-controlled IRA volunteer codenamed &quot;Stakeknife&quot; and that, unaware of this IRA volunteer&#x27;s value to the FRU, they planned to assassinate him. Allegedly, after the FRU discovered &quot;Stakeknife&quot; was in danger from UDA assassination, they used Brian Nelson to persuade the UDA to assassinate Francisco Notarantonio instead, a Belfast pensioner who had been interned as an Irish republican in the 1940s. The killing of Notarantonio was claimed by the UFF at the time. Following the killing of Notarantonio, unaware of the involvement of the FRU, the IRA assassinated two UDA leaders in reprisal attacks. It has also been alleged that the FRU secretly passed details of the two UDA leaders to the IRA via &quot;Stakeknife&quot; in an effort to distract attention from him as a possible informer.

== FRU and the Stevens Inquiry ==
Former FRU operative Martin Ingram asserted that the arson attack which destroyed the offices of the Stevens Inquiry at RUC Headquarters in Carrickfergus in 1990 was carried out by the FRU to destroy evidence on operational activities collected by Stevens&#x27; regarding crimes
committed by one of its double agents (allegedly Brian Nelson). At the conclusion of the Stevens Inquiry in 2003, files on nine former members of the FRU were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland in regards to illegal activity uncovered by the inquiry.

<doc id="228620" wikidata="Q899043" url="?curid=228620" title="Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 1900 Summer Olympics took place in Paris, France. Two of the golf events that were contested in early October at the Compiègne Club, Compiègne as part of the Exposition Universelle, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s individual stroke play competitions, have since been afforded Olympic status. As such the 1900 games are recognised as the first time that golf was held in the Olympics.

==Format==
The men&#x27;s individual championship was a 36-hole stroke play amateur competition, while the women&#x27;s championship was a 9-hole stroke play competition. Other golf competitions, not considered Olympic, that were held included handicap and putting competitions.

==Venue==
The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s event took place at the Compiègne Club, about 50 km (30 miles) north of Paris. The golf course was built in 1896 and was one of just 25 courses in France in 1900. It was designed by M.W. Freemantle and built within the horse racing track of Compiègne. The topography was flat, with dense rough surrounding the fairways and very tiny &quot;postage stamp&quot; sized greens.

==Tournament play==
The men&#x27;s tournament was played on 2 October 1900 where they played two 18-hole rounds back-to-back. The following day, 3 October 1900, the women&#x27;s tournament began, where they only played 9 holes.

===Men&#x27;s championship===
Charles Sands, representative of the St. Andrews Golf Club in Yonkers, New York finished the 36 hole tournament with 82+85=167 defeating Walter Rutherford of Jedburgh, Scotland by one stroke. In third place was David Robertson of Scotland.

===Women&#x27;s championship===
The women&#x27;s championship was a stage for many firsts that occurred in the Olympic games. Not only was this the first time women were ever able to compete in the Olympic games, the women&#x27;s division was won by Margaret Abbott of Chicago Golf Club. Abbott shot a 47 to win and became the first ever American female to win a gold medal in the Olympic Games, though she received a gilded porcelain bowl as a prize instead of a medal. She is also the second overall American woman to receive an Olympic medal. Abbott&#x27;s mother, Mary Abbott, also competed in this Olympic event and finished tied for seventh, shooting a 65. They were the first and only mother and daughter that have ever competed in the same Olympic event at the same time.

Abbott never knew that they were competing in the Olympics; she thought it was a normal golf tournament and died not knowing. Her historic victory was not known until University of Florida professor Paula Welch began to do research into the history of the Olympics and discovered that Margaret Abbott had placed first. Over the course of ten years, she contacted Abbott&#x27;s children and informed them of their mother&#x27;s victory.

===Non-Olympic events===
The men&#x27;s handicap competition was won by American Albert Bond Lambert, with a score of 83−10=73 by two strokes from Pierre Deschamps of France, who scored 108−33=75.

==Medal summary==
Medals were awarded to the top five finishers in each event; gold for the winner, vermeil for second, silver for third, silvered bronze for fourth, and bronze for fifth.

The top three in the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s championships are considered Olympic medalists.

==Participating nations==
22 golfers from 4 nations competed at the Paris Games, excluding handicapped and professional events:

<doc id="228621" wikidata="Q186543" url="?curid=228621" title="Gymnastics at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics one gymnastics event for men was contested. The competition was held on Sunday, 29 July 1900, and on Monday, 30 July 1900. There were 135 competitors from 8 nations. The top 18 places were taken by French gymnasts, of which there were more than 100. The event was won by Gustave Sandras, with Noël Bas finishing second and Lucien Démanet third. The highest-placing foreign gymnast was Jules Ducret of Switzerland, in a tie for 19th place.

==Medal summary==
==Background==

This was the first appearance of an all-around event. There had been various apparatus events at the 1896 Games, but no overall competition. In contrast, the 1900 Games saw only the all-around event without medals or separate events for any individual apparatus. At the time, athletics events were often combined with gymnastics events in combined events such as this one.

The Swiss championships were scheduled for a week after this competition, resulting in few Swiss gymnasts competing here.

==Competition format==

Gymnasts performed in 16 exercises, many of them being two competitions of the same discipline with one compulsory exercise and one voluntary exercise. There was a maximum of 20 points in each exercise, leading to a total maximum of 320 points. The events were mostly gymnastic in nature, but also included a number of athletics events and a weightlifting competition.

* 1. and 2. - Horizontal bar (compulsory and optional exercises)
* 3. and 4. - Parallel bars (compulsory and optional exercises)
* 5. and 6. - Rings (compulsory and optional exercises)
* 7. and 8. - Pommel horse (compulsory and optional exercises)
* 9. and 10. - Floor exercise (compulsory and optional exercises)
* 11. - Horse vault (compulsory exercise)
* 12. - Combined high jump
* 13. - Long jump
* 14. - Pole vault
* 15. - Rope climbing
* 16. - Weightlifting

The combined high jump required a jump over a rope that was 1.25 metres above the ground and 1 metre away from the take-off. The scoring standard for the long jump was 5 metres; for the pole vault, 2.2 metres. The rope climbing featured a rope of 6 metres. The weightlifting used a 50 kilograms weight, with 2 points for each overhead lift up to 10 lifts.

<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics, a Basque pelota tournament was contested.

Only two teams entered - one from Spain and one from France - but the French team of Maurice Durquetty and Etchegaray withdrew on the afternoon of the single contest due to a disagreement about the rules. Therefore, the contest was scratched and the Spanish team were awarded first prize.

This is the only Olympics to date where pelota was an official sport, being revived at the 1924, 1968 and 1992 Games as a demonstration sport.

<doc id="228624" wikidata="Q7449302" url="?curid=228624" title="Semi-generic">
<text>Semi-generic is a legal term used in by the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to refer to a specific type of wine designation. The majority of these were originally based on the names of well-known European wine-producing regions. Consumers didn&#x27;t recognize grape varieties at that time and New World producers used the familiar names to suggest the style of wine they were offering for sale. U.S. regulations require that semi-generic names (for example, California champagne) may be used on a wine label only if there appears next to such name the appellation of &quot;the actual place of origin&quot; in order to prevent any possible consumer confusion.

The practice primarily ceased in 2006 with the Wine Trade Agreement, though existing brands can continue the practice, considered grandfathered in.

==Recent problems==
Over the past thirty years, with the popularity of varietal labeling, semi-generic names have largely fallen out of use. They are typically only used on inexpensive wines sold in jugs or cartons and most of those now use the more popular varietal labeling.

The use of these names is a subject of some disagreement. Through trade agreements, the European Union has protected most of these names in its major export markets. In 1993, Australia agreed not to use European place names and France and Italy agreed to stop using the term Tokay, which is now reserved for Hungarian wines. The use of semi-generic names is beginning to become a problem for US domestic and foreign policy because as many American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) are becoming more popular around the world, they are seeking greater protection for their names inside and outside the U.S. In 2006, the U.S. agreed with the EU in the Wine Trade Agreement to refrain from adding any additional labels to class of semi-generic wines.

Some U.S. states have laws which additionally restrict or prohibit the use of semi-generic names wines produced within their borders.

==Definition==
In the U.S., semi-generics are defined by law in 27 CFR 4.24. There are two types.
The first type is names that can legally refer to any grape wine whatsoever. In practice, most have become associated with a given style, which is noted.
* Burgundy – Generic red wine, for example Gallo&#x27;s Hearty Burgundy. Named after French Burgundy.
* Chablis – Generic white wine, named after Chablis.
* Chianti – Generic red, named after Italy&#x27;s Chianti.
* Claret – Also generic red wine, named after Claret, the British term for French red Bordeaux.
* Malaga – A sherry, named after Málaga in Spain.
* Moselle – Generic sweet white, based on a German style produced in the Moselle River valley.
* Rhine Wine (syn. Hock) – Generic sweet white, after Germany&#x27;s Rhine River. Hock is named after Hochheim.
* Sauterne – White or pink, dry or sweet, named after Sauternes but deliberately misspelled.
* Haut Sauterne – Same as above.
* Tokay – Generic white, named after Hungary&#x27;s Tokaji.

The second type of semi-generic names have restrictions on what kind of wine they can be. The legal restriction is listed first, followed by the original term.
* Angelica – Fortified wine of 18–24% alcohol, named after Los Angeles.
* Champagne – Sparkling wine, named after France&#x27;s Champagne.
* Marsala – Wine of 14–24% alcohol, named after Italy&#x27;s Marsala.
* Madeira – Fortified wine of 18–24% alcohol, named after Portugal&#x27;s Madeira.
* Port – Fortified wine, named after Portugal&#x27;s Porto.
* Sherry Fortified wine of 17–24% alcohol, named after Spain&#x27;s Sherry.

<doc id="228626" wikidata="Q205716" url="?curid=228626" title="Parazoa">
<text>Parazoa (Parazoa, gr. Παρα-, para, &quot;next to&quot;, and ζωα, zoa, &quot;animals&quot;) are a taxon with sub-kingdom category that is located at the base of the phylogenetic tree of the animal kingdom in opposition to the sub-kingdom Eumetazoa; they group together the most primitive forms, characterized by not having proper tissues or that, in any case, these tissues are only partially differentiated. They generally group a single phylum, Porifera, which lack muscles, nerves and internal organs, which in many cases resembles a cell colony rather than a multicellular organism itself. All other animals are eumetazoans, which do have differentiated tissues.

On occasion, Parazoa reunites Porifera with Archaeocyatha, a group of extinct sponges sometimes considered a separate phylum. In other cases, Placozoa is included, depending on the authors.

==Porifera and Archaeocyatha==
Porifera and Archaeocyatha show similarities such as benthic and sessile habitat and the presence of pores, with differences such as the presence of internal walls and septa in Archaeocyatha. They have been considered separate phyla, however, the consensus is growing that Archaeocyatha was in fact a type of sponge that can be classified into Porifera.

==Porifera and Placozoa==
Some authors include in Parazoa the poriferous or sponge phyla and Placozoa on the basis of shared primitive characteristics: Both are simple, show a lack of true tissues and organs, have both asexual and sexual reproduction, and are invariably aquatic. As animals, they are a group that in various studies are at the base of the phylogenetic tree, albeit in a paraphyletic form. Of this group only surviving sponges, which belong to the phylum Porifera, and &quot;Trichoplax&quot; in the phylum Placozoa.

Parazoa do not show any body symmetry (they are asymmetric); all other groups of animals show some kind of symmetry. There are currently 5000 species, 150 of which are freshwater. The larvae are planktonic and the adults are sessile. The Parazoa–Eumetazoa division has been estimated to be 940 million years ago.

The Parazoa group is now considered paraphyletic. When referenced, it is sometimes considered an equivalent to the Porifera.

Some authors include the Placozoa, a phylum long thought to consist of a single species, &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot;, in the division, but sometimes it is also placed in the Agnotozoa subkingdom.

==Phylogeny==
According to the most up-to-date phylogeny, Porifera should not have a direct relationship with Placozoa. In any case, placozoans have simplified coelenterates without common characteristics with sponges.

<text>The Province of East Jersey, along with the Province of West Jersey, between 1674 and 1702 in accordance with the Quintipartite Deed, were two distinct political divisions of the Province of New Jersey, which became the U.S. state of New Jersey. The two provinces were amalgamated in 1702. East Jersey&#x27;s capital was located at Perth Amboy. Determination of an exact location for a border between West Jersey and East Jersey was often a matter of dispute.

The area comprising East Jersey had been part of New Netherland. Early settlement (including today&#x27;s Bergen and Hudson counties) by the Dutch included Pavonia (1633), Vriessendael (1640) and Achter Kol (1642). These settlements were compromised in Kieft&#x27;s War (1643–1645) and the Peach War (1655). Settlers again returned to the western shores of the Hudson River with the 1660 formation of Bergen, New Netherland, which would become the first permanent European settlement in the territory of the modern state of New Jersey. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War, on August 27, 1664, New Amsterdam surrendered to English forces.

Between 1664 and 1674, most settlement was from other parts of the Americas, especially New England, Long Island, and the West Indies. Elizabethtown and Newark in particular had a strong Puritan character. South of the Raritan River the Monmouth Tract was developed primarily by Quakers from Long Island. In 1675, East Jersey was partitioned into four counties for administrative purposes: Bergen County, Essex County, Middlesex County, and Monmouth County. There were seven established towns: Shrewsbury, Middleton, Piscataway, Woodbridge, Elizabethtown, Newark, and Bergen. In a survey taken in 1684, the population was estimated to be 3,500 individuals in about 700 families (African slaves were not included).

Although a number of the East Jersey proprietors in England were Quakers and the governor through most of the 1680s was the leading Quaker Robert Barclay, the Quaker influence on government was not significant. Even the immigration instigated by Barclay was oriented toward promoting Scottish influence more than Quaker influence. In 1682, Barclay and the other Scottish proprietors began the development of Perth Amboy as the capital of the province. In 1687, James II permitted ships to be cleared at Perth Amboy.

Frequent disputes between the residents and the mostly-absentee proprietors over land ownership and quitrents plagued the province until its surrender to Queen Anne&#x27;s government in 1702.

<text>Gerhard Heinrich Friedrich Otto Julius Herzberg, (; December 25, 1904 – March 3, 1999) was a German-Canadian pioneering physicist and physical chemist, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1971, &quot;for his contributions to the knowledge of electronic structure and geometry of molecules, particularly free radicals&quot;. Herzberg&#x27;s main work concerned atomic and molecular spectroscopy. He is well known for using these techniques that determine the structures of diatomic and polyatomic molecules, including free radicals which are difficult to investigate in any other way, and for the chemical analysis of astronomical objects. Herzberg served as Chancellor of Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada from 1973 to 1980.

==Early life and family==

Herzberg was born in Hamburg, Germany on December 25, 1904 to Albin H. Herzberg and Ella Biber. He had an older brother, Walter, who was born in January 1904. Herzberg started Vorschule (pre-school) late, after contracting measles. Gerhard and his family were atheists and kept this fact hidden. His father died in 1914, at 43 years of age, after having suffered from dropsy and complications due to an earlier heart condition. Herzberg graduated Vorschule shortly after his father&#x27;s death. He married Luise Oettinger, a spectroscopist and fellow researcher in 1929. (Luise Herzberg, died in 1971.)

==Nazi Persecution and Immigration to Canada==
In 1933, the Nazi Party introduced a law banning men with Jewish wives from teaching at universities. Herzberg was working as a lecturer at the university in Darmstadt. His wife and fellow researcher, Luise Herzberg, was Jewish so they began making plans to leave Germany near the end of 1933. Leaving Germany was a daunting task as many barriers faced the thousands of Germans trying to flee Nazi persecution. However Herzberg had earlier worked with a visiting physical chemist named John Spinks, from the University of Saskatchewan. Spinks helped Herzberg get a job at the university in Saskatoon. When Herzberg and his wife left Germany in 1935, the Nazis let them take only the equivalent of $2.50 each and personal belongings.

==Education and career==

Initially, Herzberg considered a career in astronomy, but his application to the Hamburg Observatory was returned advising him not to pursue a career in the field without private financial support. After completing high school at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums, Herzberg continued his education at Darmstadt University of Technology with the help of a private scholarship. Herzberg completed his Dr.-Ing. degree under in 1928.

==Honours and awards==
Herzberg&#x27;s most significant award was the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which he was awarded &quot;for his contributions to the knowledge of electronic structure and geometry of molecules, particularly free radicals&quot;. During the presentation speech, it was noted that at the time of the award, Herzberg was &quot;generally considered to be the world&#x27;s foremost molecular spectroscopist.&quot;

Herzberg was honoured with memberships or fellowships by a very large number of scientific societies, received many awards and honorary degrees in different countries. The NSERC Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering, Canada&#x27;s highest research award, was named in his honour in 2000. The Canadian Association of Physicists also has an annual award named in his honour. The Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics is named for him. He was made a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science. Asteroid 3316 Herzberg is named after him. In 1964 he was awarded the Frederic Ives Medal by the OSA. He was later named an Honorary Member of the Society. At Carleton University, there is a building named after him that belongs to the Physics and Mathematics/Statistics Departments, Herzberg Laboratories. Herzberg was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951.

The main building of John Abbott College in Montreal is named after him. Carleton University named the Herzberg Laboratories building after him. A public park in the College Park neighbourhood of Saskatoon also bears his name.

==Books and publications==
Herzberg authored some classic works in the field of spectroscopy, including &quot;Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure&quot; and the encyclopaedic four volume work: &quot;Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure&quot;, which is often called the spectroscopist&#x27;s bible. The three volumes of Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure were re-issued by Krieger in 1989, including extensive new footnotes by Herzberg. Volume IV of the series, &quot;Constants of diatomic molecules&quot; is purely a reference work, a compendium of known spectroscopic constants (and therefore a bibliography of molecular spectroscopy) of diatomic molecules up until 1978.

<doc id="228630" wikidata="Q371656" url="?curid=228630" title="Eudora (email client)">
<text>Eudora () is a family of email clients that was used on the classic Mac OS, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows operating systems. It also supported several palmtop computing platforms, including Newton and the Palm OS. 

The final Macintosh and Windows versions of Eudora, released in 2006, were succeeded by the Qualcomm-backed, cross-platform Eudora OSE (q.v.), built on an unrelated codebase (namely that of Mozilla Thunderbird) with additional extensions. The first and last version of Eudora OSE was released in 2010 to negative reviews and lukewarm support; development subsequently ceased due to a lack of funding.

The last &#x27;mainline&#x27; (pre-OSE) versions of Eudora for Mac and Windows were open-sourced and preserved as an artefact by the Computer History Museum in 2018; as part of the preservation, the CHM assumed ownership of the Eudora trademark.

The only actively maintained fork of the software, known as Eudoramail as of June 2024, originated from &#x27;mainline&#x27; Eudora for Windows as preserved by the CHM. Hermes, its maintainers, described Eudoramail 8.0 as currently being in alpha; Wellington typographer Jack Yan, meanwhile, points out its stability, a number of well-characterised and reproducible display bugs notwithstanding. As of December 2024, the website is down.

==History==

=== Pre-Qualcomm (1988–1991) ===
Eudora was developed in 1988 by Steve Dorner, who worked at the Computer Services Organization of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The software was named after American author Eudora Welty, because of her short story &quot;Why I Live at the P.O.&quot;; Dorner rearranged the title to form the slogan &quot;Bringing the P.O. to Where You Live&quot; for his software. Although he regretted naming it after the still-living author because he thought doing so was &quot;presumptuous&quot;, Welty was reportedly &quot;pleased and amused&quot; by Dorner&#x27;s tribute. This original UIUC incarnation of Eudora was compatible with the Classic Mac OS only.

=== Qualcomm years and first Windows version (1991–2006) ===
Eudora was acquired by Qualcomm in 1991. Qualcomm produced a visually and functionally similar analogue, though the resemblance was merely superficial. Until the birth-&quot;cum&quot;-death of Eudora OSE, the Mac and Windows programs were developed by different teams at Qualcomm, in different programming languages (C and C++), and had different milestones. 

The software was originally distributed free of charge; in response to management pressure, Eudora was later commercialized and offered as a Light (freeware) and Pro (commercial) product. Between 2003 and 2006 the full-featured Pro version was also available as a &quot;Sponsored mode&quot; (adware) distribution. 

In 1995, in response to the rise of webmail services, Qualcomm licensed the Eudora trademark to WhoWhere? (later acquired by Lycos); this service operated until 2006, when the eudoramail.com domain ceased accepting new accounts and existing accounts were reintegrated into Lycos Mail. In 2006, Qualcomm also ceased development of the &#x27;mainline&#x27; version of Eudora for Windows (in all its forms: adware, freeware, and commercial). 

=== Hiatus and source code release (2006–2025) ===
Rather than devote continued resources to the development of a loss leader product, Qualcomm instead sponsored the creation of a new open-source version based on Mozilla Thunderbird, code-named Penelope, later renamed to Eudora OSE. Development of the open-source version stopped in 2010 and was officially deprecated in 2013, with users advised to switch to the current version of Thunderbird.

On May 22, 2018, after five years of discussion with Qualcomm, the Computer History Museum acquired full ownership of the source code, the Eudora trademarks, copyrights, and domain names. The transfer agreement from Qualcomm also allowed the Computer History Museum to publish the source code under the BSD open source license. The Eudora source code distributed by the Computer History Museum is the same except for the addition of the new license, code sanitization of profanity within its comments, and the removal of third-party software whose distribution rights had long expired.

=== Under Hermes ===

==== Pre-production (2018–2019) ====
In August 2018, a &quot;small team&quot; started working on patching the lacunae in the Eudora code, in order to render it usable on modern systems. According to the initial posting on the eudora-win mailing list, the intent was to decouple entirely from Stingray Desktop, a proprietary library designed for constructing graphical user interfaces under Windows. Originally, Stingray Desktop was known as Objective Toolkit and was developed by Stingray Software (which was acquired on March 3, 1998 by Rogue Wave); as of 2024, it is produced by Perforce. The rationale was that this would allow the mail client (named simply &quot;Hermes Mail&quot; at the time) to be fully open source.

Likewise, Eudora for Windows 7.1.0.9 (the final version released by Qualcomm) leveraged Microsoft Trident as its browser engine (i.e. HTML renderer), a software component deprecated by Microsoft in favour of EdgeHTML as of 2018; the latter would be superseded in turn by Blink. Replacing Trident was part of the project&#x27;s strategy at the outset and, as of June 2024, remains so (see &quot;Features&quot;, &quot;infra&quot;).

During the time it had been under Qualcomm management, Eudora for Windows had never implemented support for character encoding, and had instead been hardcoded to declare every e-mail message sent as encoded iso-8859-1 (irrespective of the actual content) and to display every incoming message using the system encoding (one of the Windows encodings, depending on the language version of the system). Even before 2006, this created problems for users corresponding in languages other than Western European ones; later on, as UTF-8 became more and more popular, it became a problem for everyone without exception.

Finally, Eudora 7.1.0.9 and earlier predated the Heartbleed vulnerability and thus refused to negotiate securely using Transport Layer Security with servers that implemented the security patch; they also did not include a modern root certificate store. Therefore, some users had resorted to tunnelling with stunnel as a workaround while others simply trusted the offending certificates manually.

It was determined that the three former problems had to be remedied in the executable code of the mail client itself, but that the latter could be patched by replacing two dynamic-link libraries and the root-certificate store. Accordingly, pre-production of the mail client (which underwent a rebrand, first from &quot;Hermes Mail&quot; to the project codename &quot;Aurora&quot;, and subsequently to &quot;Eudoramail&quot;) involved the release of the so-called &quot;HERMES SSL Extensions&quot;, also under an open source licence. 

==== Production (2019–2022) ====
Eudoramail itself began development on 17 June 2019, using Perforce&#x27;s Stingray user-interface toolkit, &quot;no matter how distasteful we find that to be&quot;, a decision the developers felt was justified &quot;given our talents, circumstances and limitations&quot;, notwithstanding the estimated outlay (between $2,800 and $3,600). On 31 March 2022, it was announced that &quot;HERMES Mail is on the launchpad and final preparations are made for liftoff&quot;, with the initial alpha of Eudoramail 8.0 being released on Aug 1 2022. At the time, the stated policy was that it would be a soft launch, with the release being phased in first for testers, then for users on the &quot;eudora-win&quot; mailing list on the Clio ListMoms Cartel, and finally for the public at large.
== Features ==
Eudora 6.0.1 added support for Bayesian filtering of spam with a feature called &quot;SpamWatch&quot;. Eudora 6.2 added a scam watch feature that flags suspicious links within emails in an attempt to thwart phishing. Eudora 7.0 added Indexed search (powered by X1 Discovery), which finds any emails using single or multiple criteria in seconds; due to lack of legal permissions, this feature is missing in Eudoramail 8.0 (unless a customer already has an existing copy of codice_1 , which can be placed into the program directory to restore X1 functionality).

Eudora has support for &quot;stationery&quot;, a standard message or reply prepared ahead of time to a common question. Eudora stores emails in a modified mbox format (*.mbx), which uses plain text files instead of a database as Microsoft Outlook does. This allows the user to back up portions of their email correspondence without backing up the entire database.

Eudora supports the POP3, IMAP and SMTP protocols. Eudora also has support for SSL and, in Windows, S/MIME authentication, allowing users to sign or encrypt email communications for greatest security.

Eudora is noteworthy for its extensive variety of settings to customize its behavior, many of which are not available in the user interface but are accessed using x-eudora-setting URIs that must be pasted into a message and clicked.

=== Third-party plugins ===
At least two third-party plugins exist that can convert characters that also exist in iso-8859-1, and it is also possible to run it with &quot;Mime-proxy&quot;, but depending on a specific user&#x27;s needs and due in part to the internal limitations of Eudora, they may only offer a partial solution.

<doc id="228632" wikidata="Q388074" url="?curid=228632" title="Polo at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics, a polo tournament was contested. Matches were held on 28 May, 31 May, and 2 June. Five teams competed. Four of these teams were of mixed nationality, with British and French athletes competing on three teams. There was no playoff for third place.

==Background==

The &quot;Olympic&quot; polo tournament, or the &quot;Grand Prix International d&#x27;Exposition&quot;, was one of multiple polo tournaments played in Paris in late May and early June 1900. It was the first time that polo was played at the Olympics; the sport would appear again in 1908, 1920, 1924, and 1936. Each time, the tournament was for men only.

==Competition format==

The competition was a single elimination tournament, with no third place match. Teams did not have to consist of entirely players from a single nation at the time, with four of the five competing teams being mixed. 

Further, players were apparently permitted to play for multiple teams during the same tournament: Maurice Raoul-Duval played for both Bagatelle and Compiègne.

==Participating nations==
A total of 20 players from 4 nations competed at the Paris Games:

<doc id="228637" wikidata="Q47695" url="?curid=228637" title="Rudolf Christoph Eucken">
<text>Rudolf Christoph Eucken (; ; 5 January 184614 September 1926) was a German philosopher. He received the 1908 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;in recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and strength in presentation with which in his numerous works he has vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of life&quot;, after he had been nominated by a member of the Swedish Academy.

==Early life==
Eucken was born on 5 January 1846 in Aurich, then in the Kingdom of Hanover (now Lower Saxony). His father, Ammo Becker Eucken died when he was a child, and he was brought up by his mother, Ida Maria (née Gittermann). He was educated at Aurich, where one of his teachers was the classical philologist and philosopher Ludwig Wilhelm Maximilian Reuter. He studied at Göttingen University (1863–1866), where Hermann Lotze was one of his teachers, and Berlin University. In the latter place, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg was a professor whose ethical tendencies and historical treatment of philosophy greatly attracted him.

==Career==
Eucken received his PhD in classical philology and ancient history at Göttingen University in 1866 with a dissertation titled &quot;De Aristotelis dicendi ratione&quot;. However, the inclination of his mind was definitely towards the philosophical side of theology. In 1871, after five years working as a school teacher at Husum, Berlin und Frankfurt, he was appointed Professor of Philosophy at the University of Basel, Switzerland, succeeding another of his former teachers at Göttingen, Gustav Teichmüller, and beating Friedrich Nietzsche in competition for the position. He stayed there until 1874 when he took up a similar position at the University of Jena. He stayed there until he retired in 1920. In 1912–13, Eucken spent half of the year as an exchange professor at Harvard University, and in 1913 he served as a Deem lecturer at New York University. During World War I, Eucken, like many of his academic colleagues, took a strong line in favour of the causes with which his country had associated itself.

==Ethical activism==
Eucken&#x27;s philosophical work is partly historical and partly constructive, the former side being predominant in his earlier, the latter in his later works. Their most striking feature is the close organic relationship between the two parts. The aim of the historical works is to show the necessary connection between philosophical concepts and the age to which they belong; the same idea is at the root of his constructive speculation. All philosophy is philosophy of life, the development of a new culture, not mere intellectualism, but the application of a vital religious inspiration to the practical problems of society. This practical idealism Eucken described by the term &quot;ethical activism&quot; (). In accordance with this principle, Eucken gave considerable attention to social and educational problems.

He maintained that humans have souls, and that they are therefore at the junction between nature and spirit. He believed that people should overcome their non-spiritual nature by continuous efforts to achieve a spiritual life, another aspect of his ethical activism and meaning of life.

==Later life and death==
Rudolf Eucken married Irene Passow in 1882 and had a daughter and two sons. His son Walter Eucken became a famous founder of ordoliberal thought in economics. His son Arnold Eucken was a chemist and physicist.

Rudolf Eucken died on 15 September 1926 in Jena at the age of 80.

He has an older brother, Richard (born 1956), an NYPD sergeant, and a younger brother, Robert (born c. 1966), a second grade teacher in New York City.

Romano attended elementary and middle school at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in Forest Hills. After transferring from Archbishop Molloy High School, Romano graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1975. He was in the same high school class as Fran Drescher. Before getting into show business, Romano briefly attended Queens College, in Flushing, New York, where he studied accounting.

==Career==
His early comedy career started when he competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989, directed by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; short film producer Neal Marshad and appeared on The Comedy Channel. His career included many outlets, such as Comedy Central, where he had been a recurring guest voice on the show &quot;Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist&quot;. He also was a contestant on &quot;Star Search&quot; in the stand-up comedy category. He was cast to play Joe (originally named Rick) on the American television sitcom &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, but was fired and replaced with Greg Lee in the pilot and then Joe Rogan for the rest of the show. He then appeared on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; doing his stand up routine which formed his ties with CBS. Shortly thereafter, he became the star of his own show, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; on CBS, that featured a cast and format more suitable to Romano&#x27;s brand of humor. His work on the series earned him six Primetime Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, a category he won in 2002. He also shared two Emmy Awards as an executive producer when his show won as Outstanding Comedy Series in 2003 and 2005.

Romano performed the opening monologue at the 1998 White House Correspondents&#x27; Association dinner.

Romano and his comedian friend Kevin James starred in the salesman comedy &quot;Grilled&quot; as two average Joes of the same profession who are both desperate to land a big sale.

Romano was featured on a 2000 episode of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, on which he won $125,000 for the NYPD&#x27;s D.A.R.E. unit. The following year, he and one of his brothers appeared on a New York Police Department recruiting poster.

In 2004, Romano became the highest-paid television actor in history for his role of Raymond on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. The show broke another record by having the highest revenue, at $3.9 billion.

On December 13, 2003, Romano was a guest star, sending a birthday card to Bob Barker for Barker&#x27;s 80th birthday on the 27th &quot;Million Dollar Spectacular&quot; special of the CBS game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.

Romano was the subject of the documentary film &quot;95 Miles to Go&quot;. The film documents Romano&#x27;s road trip for a series of rides across the south of the United States. The film was released in theaters on April 7, 2010, by ThinkFilm. In August 2006 Romano was interviewed in front of a live audience at UCLA by fellow stand-up veteran David Steinberg, for an episode of &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg&quot;. The program first aired on the TV Land network in March 2007.

Romano returned to television with a new dramedy for TNT in 2008, &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot;, which he co-created with former &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; writer Mike Royce. It co-starred Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher.

Romano made an appearance in the seventh season of NBC series &quot;The Office&quot; as Merv Bronte, a nervous job applicant interviewing for the job left vacant by Michael Scott.

Romano made an appearance in the third-season premiere of the ABC sitcom &quot;The Middle&quot; as Nicky, a friend of Mike, who ruined his and Frankie&#x27;s honeymoon. Romano was the second actor from &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; to be reunited with Patricia Heaton on &quot;The Middle&quot;; Doris Roberts guest starred in three episodes.

He joined the cast of &quot;Parenthood&quot; beginning with its fourth season premiere. He became a semi regular, playing photographer Hank Rizzoli, who hired and later had a romantic relationship with Sarah Braverman and developed a friendship with her nephew who has Asperger syndrome. The role was specifically created for him after he expressed his love for the series and met with creator Jason Katims on the set of &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;.

In 2002, Romano voiced the woolly mammoth Manny the film &quot;Ice Age&quot;, and its sequels &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot; in 2006, &quot;Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs&quot; in 2009, &quot;Ice Age: Continental Drift&quot; in 2012, and &quot;Ice Age: Collision Course&quot; in 2016.

From 2017 to 2019, Romano played a leading role in three seasons of the &quot;MGM+&quot; television show &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, created by Davey Holmes and co-starring Chris O&#x27;Dowd.

In 2019, Romano starred in the Netflix comedy film &quot;Paddleton&quot; and portrayed mob lawyer Bill Bufalino in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Irishman&quot;.

Romano is set to play Jim Valvano in an upcoming film about him.

==Competitions==

Romano competed in the World Series of Poker in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2023.

In early 2010, Romano starred in the second season of The Golf Channel&#x27;s original series &quot;The Haney Project&quot; in which Tiger Woods&#x27; former coach Hank Haney attempts to improve the golf games of different celebrities and athletes. Romano&#x27;s goal was to finish the show being able to break 80. Romano took time off from the show to be with his father, Albert Romano, who died in March 2010. Romano is also a regular competitor in the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, where he finished fifth in 2012 with his partner, Australian professional Steven Bowditch. It was the first time Romano had qualified for the final round after failing to do so on 11 successive occasions. He also competes annually in the American Century Championship, a celebrity golf tournament owned by NBC and held at Lake Tahoe each July.

==Personal life==
Romano married his wife, Anna Scarpulla, in 1987. They met while working at the same bank. They have four children. Romano&#x27;s character&#x27;s daughter on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; was named after his real life daughter, Alexandra &quot;Ally&quot; Romano. Also, in the series pilot, Ray and Debra&#x27;s twin boys were named Gregory and Matthew, after Romano&#x27;s real life twin sons, but Romano felt it was inconvenient to have all his television children have the same names as his real children and changed the twins&#x27; names to Geoffrey and Michael onscreen. He also said his brother was not pleased with Ray Barone&#x27;s television brother.

Romano&#x27;s family has made various appearances in the show. Romano&#x27;s daughter made several appearances on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; as Molly, the best friend of his on screen daughter, Ally, and the daughter of Ray Barone&#x27;s nemesis, Peggy the Cookie Lady. Romano&#x27;s father, Albert Romano, has made various appearances as Albert, one of Frank Barone&#x27;s lodge buddies in various episodes, such as &quot;Debra at the Lodge&quot;, and &quot;Boys&#x27; Therapy&quot;. Romano&#x27;s brother, Richard Romano, appeared in the episodes &quot;Golf For It&quot;, &quot;Just a Formality&quot;, and &quot;The Toaster&quot;. Romano&#x27;s wife, Anna, appeared as one of the moms in the background at Geoffrey and Michael&#x27;s school in season 6&#x27;s episode titled &quot;The Angry Family&quot;.

In February 2012, Romano revealed that his wife, Anna, had successfully battled stage one breast cancer in 2010. Romano told &quot;People&quot; magazine that &quot;the reason we&#x27;re going public is to share our experience, yeah, but to have an effect. Our goal is to help people.&quot;

Romano was close friends with Doris Roberts, who played Marie Barone, Ray Barone&#x27;s mother, on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. At the time of her death, Romano said he was inspired by her desire to continue learning throughout her life. She also served as a mentor, helping him to feel more comfortable on set.

<text>In certain languages, the final form or terminal form is a special character used to represent a letter only when it occurs at the end of a word. 
Some languages that use final form characters are: Arabic, Hebrew, Manchu and one letter in Greek ().

The lowercase Latin letter &quot;s&quot; had separate medial (ſ) and final (s) in the orthographies of many European languages from the medieval period to the early 19th century; it survived in the German Fraktur script until the 1940s.

==Hebrew==
In the Hebrew alphabet the final form is called sofit (, meaning &quot;final&quot; or &quot;ending&quot;).

This set of letters is known acronymically as ( letters).

The now final forms predate their non-final counterparts; They were the default forms used in any position within a word. Their descender eventually bent forwards when preceding another letter to facilitate writing. A final form of these letters is also called &quot;pshuta&quot; (, meaning extended or plain).

The letter Mem also had a descender , however, its current final form was a variant of used interchangeably in all positions. The standardization is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (Megillah 2b-3a and Shabbas 104a). One instance of a medial is preserved in Isaiah 9:6 of the Hebrew Bible, while Nehemiah 2:13 and arguably Genesis 49:19–20 have a final .

Modern Hebrew uses the forms finally, when transcribing a plosive pronunciation, for example (microscope), (Mubarak, ), while their final forms , are transcribing a fricative pronunciation, for example (Kach), (Chef).

<doc id="228648" wikidata="Q173228" url="?curid=228648" title="A. J. Foyt">
<text>Anthony Joseph Foyt Jr. (born January 16, 1935) is an American former racing driver who competed in numerous disciplines of motorsport. He is best known for his open wheel racing career, and for becoming the first four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500. He holds the most American National Championship titles in history, winning seven.

Foyt competed in United States Automobile Club (USAC) Championship cars, sprint cars and midget cars. He raced stock cars in NASCAR and USAC. He won several major sports car racing events. He holds the USAC career wins record with 159 victories, and the Indy car racing career wins record with 67.

Foyt is the only driver to have won the Indianapolis 500, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Daytona 500, and the 24 Hours of Daytona. In the NASCAR stock car circuit, Foyt won seven times, including the 1964 Firecracker 400 and the 1972 Daytona 500. He survived three major crashes that caused serious injuries and narrowly escaped a fourth. Foyt&#x27;s success has led to induction into numerous motorsports halls of fame.

In the mid-1960s, Foyt became a team owner, fielding cars for himself and other drivers. Since retiring from active race driving, he has owned A. J. Foyt Enterprises, which has fielded teams in CART, the IndyCar Series, and NASCAR.

==Early life==
Foyt was born in Houston, Texas, to Anthony Joseph &quot;Tony&quot; Foyt and Emma Evelyn Monk Foyt. His father was an auto mechanic who owned and raced midget race cars as a hobby. Foyt&#x27;s father built A. J. a toy racer with a lawnmower engine when he was five years old. Tony recalled that when he and his wife left an eleven-year-old A. J. home to attend a race, they returned to find the boy had done considerable damage to the home driving the family&#x27;s other race car in the yard, and had caused the car&#x27;s engine to catch on fire. While angry, the older Foyt did accept the likelihood of A. J. having a future as a driver.

Foyt attended Pershing and Hamilton middle schools, and Lamar, San Jacinto and St. Thomas Catholic high schools, but he dropped out to become a mechanic and spend more time concentrating on racing. When he obtained a driver&#x27;s license, Foyt purchased a used Oldsmobile and practiced the mechanical skills he had learned working on his father&#x27;s cars on it. He also began street racing with the car until discovered by his father.

==Driving career==

===Midget car career===
Foyt began racing midgets in 1953 at age 18 in a car owned and maintained by his father. He started his USAC career in a midget car at the 1956 Night before the 500 in Anderson, Indiana. His first midget car win was at a 100 lap event at Kansas City in 1957, and finished seventh in the season points standings. He left midget cars after the 1957 season to drive in sprint cars and Championship Car. He did occasionally compete in midget car events. He won the 1960 and 1961 Turkey Night Grand Prix, the first two years that it was held at Ascot Park. He won the 1961 Hut Hundred after starting last, and finished seventh in National Midget points that year. He won the 1970 Astro Grand Prix, an event that he promoted in his hometown of Houston. He ended his career with 20 midget car feature wins. Even after he had reached the pinnacle of his sport, Foyt was known to make occasional appearances in small, local events as a way of thanking promoters who had supported him in his struggle up the ladder.

In 1975 and 1976, Foyt won the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix at the Liverpool International Speedway in Sydney when the speedway had an asphalt surface. (In Australia Midgets are called Speedcars.)

===Sprint car career===
Foyt began his sprint car career in 1956, at age 21, driving the Les Vaughn Offy with the International Motor Contest Association. On August 24, 1956, Foyt outqualified a field of 42 drivers at the Minnesota State Fair and, the following day, he won his first sprint car race, running away with the IMCA feature at the Red River Fair in Fargo, N.D. On June 16, 1957, on the high banked asphalt track at Salem, Indiana, Foyt came out on top in a race-long battle with Bob Cleberg. That victory put Foyt on the radar for USAC car owners and he switched from the IMCA to USAC later that season. Foyt eventually won 28 USAC National sprint car feature races and the USAC Eastern Championship in 1960. Foyt continued to race sprint cars long after he was firmly established as one of the top drivers at the Indy 500.

===Championship car career===

In 1958, he made his debut at Indy, but he spun out of the race on lap 148. In 1961, he became the first driver to successfully defend his points championship and win the Indianapolis 500 race. Late in the 500, Foyt made a pit stop for fuel, but a refueling malfunction meant that he returned to the race without enough fuel to finish. Eddie Sachs, unaware that Foyt&#x27;s now-quicker car was light on fuel, pushed hard to keep up—and Sachs had to pit from the lead with just three laps remaining to replace a shredded right rear tire. Foyt pitted again also but only for enough fuel to finish. He took over the lead and beat Sachs by just 8.28 seconds—the second-closest finish in history at the time. He raced in each season from 1957 to 1992, starting in 374 races and finishing in the top ten 201 times, with 67 victories. In 1958, Foyt raced in Italy in the Trophy of the Two Worlds on the banking at Monza.

Ford-powered entries were widely expected to dominate the 1964 Indianapolis 500. Discussions between Ford officials and Foyt (who had a stock car contract with Ford at the time) took place early in the month of May about the possibility of Foyt taking over the third Team Lotus-Ford, a team reserve vehicle. Foyt wanted the use of the car for the entire month, but Lotus team owner Colin Chapman was reluctant to promise him the reserve car, in case something happened to cars driven by team drivers Jim Clark and Dan Gurney.

So discussions ended and Foyt stayed with his reliable, well-sorted Offenhauser-engined roadster. In the 1964 season, Foyt won a record 10 of 14 races en route to his championship, including the Indy 500. When the two fastest Lotus-Fords, driven by Jim Clark and Bobby Marshman, fell out of the race with mechanical problems, and Parnelli Jones was knocked out when his fuel tank exploded during a pit stop, Foyt was left alone at the front of the field, and cruised home to win his second Indianapolis 500. The race is remembered for the fiery second-lap crash that claimed the lives of Dave MacDonald and Eddie Sachs. Foyt did not learn of the fate of his two friends until he reached victory lane, and was handed a newspaper with a headline announcing the tragedy.

In August 1965, at the Milwaukee Championship Car race, Foyt&#x27;s rear-engined Lotus pavement car was not at the track. So Foyt unloaded the Offenhauser-engined dirt track car he had won the race with at Springfield the previous day. He sprayed the mud off the car, installed pavement tires and a set-up for the one mile (1.6 km) oval. Foyt received permission to take two extra warm up laps during qualifying, as he had no time for practice. He then qualified the car on the pole, led the race for 18 out of 200 laps but then had to stop for a new rear tire, and finished second to Gordon Johncock, driving a rear-engined Gerhardt-Offy Indy car.

In the 1967 Indianapolis 500, Parnelli Jones&#x27; STP-Paxton Turbocar was expected to easily defeat the field of piston engines. Jones lapped the field, but his car expired with three laps remaining, and Foyt inherited the lead. As Foyt moved through turn four on the 200th lap, he had a premonition of trouble (and might have noticed the grandstand crowd was looking away from him and toward the start/finish line) and slowed down. A few hundred yards ahead of him, Carl Williams spun out as he exited turn four, triggering a five-car front-stretch accident right in front of Foyt. Traveling at no more than 100 mph, Foyt threaded his way through the wreckage and safely took the checkered flag. The race took two days to complete when rain stopped the race on the 18th lap on the first day.

In the 1977 Indianapolis 500, Foyt ran out of fuel, and had to make a pit stop. He had to make up around 32 seconds on Gordon Johncock. Foyt made up 1.5 to 2 seconds per lap by turning up his turbo boost, which risked destroying the engine. Johncock&#x27;s own engine expired just as Foyt had closed to within eight seconds after both drivers&#x27; final pit stops, and Foyt passed for the win.

In 1981, Foyt was involved in an accident at the Michigan 500 and nearly lost an arm. It took him a while to get back to full fitness; and at the Indianapolis 500 the following year he qualified third.

Foyt won the Indianapolis 500 four times, in 1961, 1964, 1967 and 1977. He is the first driver to have done so. The feat has since been matched by Al Unser (1970, 1971, 1978, 1987); Rick Mears (1979, 1984, 1988, 1991); and, Helio Castroneves (2001, 2002, 2009, and 2021). Of his 67 career Championship Car race victories, twelve were won at Trenton Speedway. Foyt also won the Indycar Series seven times, a record that still stands. Foyt qualified for the Indianapolis 500 an amazing 35 times consecutively. Foyt has recorded a top ten finish at Indianapolis in 5 consecutive decades from 1959 to the 1990s.

In the 1982 Indianapolis 500, Foyt started on the front row but on the pace laps he was victimized by a controversial wreck when second-year driver Kevin Cogan suddenly spun out for no apparent reason. Seven cars were involved in the incident including Foyt and Mario Andretti, who was unable to continue. Foyt was livid with Cogan and famously said &quot;That damn Coogan,&quot; on live radio, and when asked by Chris Economaki in a TV interview what had happened, Foyt shouted, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, he just ran right square into my Goddamn left front! (Economaki: &quot;Who are you talking about?&quot;) Cogan!&quot; Foyt repaired his car during the red flag and led the first quarter of the race but dropped out due to lingering damage from the crash.

In a 1990 CART race at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin Foyt&#x27;s car left the track and plowed straight through a dirt embankment, severely injuring his legs and feet. After multiple surgeries and months of physiotherapy he returned for the 1991 Indianapolis 500 and qualified second. He had announced his retirement before the race but changed his mind after being caught up in an early incident. He returned for a 35th consecutive start at the 1992 Indianapolis 500 and avoided all of the day&#x27;s numerous crashes to finish ninth.

===Sports car racing===
Foyt won the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans race in his first and only attempt, in 1967; Foyt drove a Ford GT40 Mk IV, partnered with Dan Gurney and entered by Carroll Shelby&#x27;s team. Prior to the race, he had angered the French fans and press by remarking that the notoriously fast and dangerous tree-lined course was &quot;nothin&#x27; but a little old country road.&quot; Also, he reportedly only got 10 laps of pre-race practice. But when Gurney overslept and missed a driver change in the middle of the night, Foyt was forced to double-stint and wound up driving nearly 18 hours of the 24-hour race. Foyt also later won the 12 Hours of Sebring and 24 Hours of Daytona in 1985 driving Porsches, making him the fourth of only 9 drivers to complete the informal &quot;triple crown&quot; of endurance racing.

===Stock car career===

====USAC Stock Car====
He was the champion in USAC&#x27;s stock car in 1968, 1978, and 1979. He finished second in 1963 and 1969, and third in 1970. Among his wins in USAC stock car racing was his 1964 win at the Billy Vukovich Memorial 200 at Hanford Speedway in California. He also was a multiple winner in USAC stockers at Milwaukee, Texas World Speedway, and Michigan International Speedway, and the Yankee 300 thrice.

====NASCAR====
Foyt, a veteran who had been racing professionally for eight seasons before trying his hand at NASCAR racing, only needed ten races to get his first victory. Richard Petty dominated the 1964 Firecracker 400 until he dropped out with engine problems. Foyt swapped the lead with Bobby Isaac for the final 50 laps of the summer event at the Daytona International Speedway. Foyt passed Isaac on the final lap to win the race.

In January 1965, Foyt qualified and ran in the front of the pack most of the day with Dan Gurney and Parnelli Jones in the Motor Trend 500 at Riverside. Parnelli retired with mechanical issues, leaving Gurney and Foyt to contest the lead. Late in the race, dueling with Gurney, Foyt spun. His car refired, and he charged through the field in an attempt to regain lost positions. After running hard to catch leader Gurney, Foyt&#x27;s brakes failed entering turn nine at the end of Riverside&#x27;s mile-long, downhill back straight. Foyt turned the car into the infield at more than 100 mph, was launched off an embankment, dropped into a lower area and slammed into a sandy embankment, violently tumbling end-over-end several times. The track doctor at Riverside International Raceway pronounced Foyt dead at the scene of the severe crash, but fellow driver Parnelli Jones revived him after seeing movement. Foyt suffered severe chest injuries, a broken back, and a fractured ankle. Footage of his flipping No. 00 Ford, owned by Holman Moody, is featured in the final scene of the movie &quot;Red Line 7000&quot;.

Foyt ran out of gas near the end of the 1971 Daytona 500, and Petty passed him for the win. Foyt again had the car to beat in the 1972 Daytona 500, but this time succeeded in a dominant performance. Only three drivers led during the race. In 1979 at the Daytona 500, Foyt was running in fifth place, but when Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison had their famous tangle on the final lap, Foyt finished in the third spot behind Darrell Waltrip and Richard Petty who again won the race. When Foyt pulled up next to Petty after the checkers to congratulate him, he was called &quot;a true gentleman&quot; during the broadcast.

Foyt won the 1971 and 1972 races at the Ontario Motor Speedway for Wood Brothers Racing. The track was shaped like the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The 1972 race was his last NASCAR points win; his final win in a NASCAR race was in the first of Daytona&#x27;s 125-mile qualifying heats in 1978, driving a self-fielded superspeedway Buick.

In 1988 Foyt was banned from NASCAR for six months and fined $5,000 following a series of incidents during the Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. NASCAR’s vice president of competition Les Richter reviewed the incident and lifted the suspension. However, his fine was raised to $7,500.
Foyt&#x27;s final NASCAR Winston Cup Series race was the 1994 Brickyard 400, the inaugural running of that race. Foyt finished 30th, four laps behind winner Jeff Gordon. Foyt entered the race again in 1995 and 1996, but failed to qualify both times. In 1995, his attempt was stymied when rain washed out second round time trials.

Foyt ended up racing three times in the early days of the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, with a best finish of 18th coming in the 1995 GM Goodwrench / Delco Battery 200, a race for which he qualified ninth.

Smokey Yunick wrote in his autobiography that, &quot;A.J. Foyt, I think, was the greatest race driver there ever has been in U.S. racing history so far...A.J. Foyt could beat your ass in anything that had a motor and wheels.&quot;

===Indianapolis 500 records===
Foyt has numerous career records at the Indianapolis 500: the first of four drivers to have won the Indianapolis 500 four times, the most consecutive and career starts (35), most races led (13), most times led during the career (39), and most competitive laps and miles during a career (4,909 laps, 12,272.5 miles).
In the 1961 Indianapolis 500 Foyt won over Eddie Sachs with a lead of 8.28 seconds, the second closest finish in Indianapolis history at the time. Shortly thereafter, Foyt and Ray Harroun (who won the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911) appeared together on a segment of the TV program &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;—their secret being their respective wins 50 years apart.

As of June 2024, Foyt stands as not only the oldest living winner of the Indianapolis 500, but also the oldest with the earliest win (1961).

==Car owner==
While an active driver, Foyt entered into a longtime partnership with Kalamazoo, Michigan businessman Jim Gilmore and raced under the Gilmore-Foyt Racing name for many years. The team built its own Coyote chassis from 1966 to 1983.

After retiring as a driver, he continued his involvement in racing as a car owner of A. J. Foyt Enterprises in the CART series, where he frequently expressed frustration with the expense of the escalating cost of chassis and engine development.

His loyalty to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway would see him become one of the few CART team owners to embrace the Indy Racing League (IRL) on its arrival in 1996, prompting him to field his team in that series. Scott Sharp took a share of the 1996 Indy Racing League (IRL) title driving for Foyt while Kenny Bräck won the 1998 IRL title, also in a Foyt car. Bräck won the 1999 Indianapolis 500 in Foyt&#x27;s car, putting him in the winner&#x27;s circle at Indy for the fifth time. The current drivers for his Indycar team, A. J. Foyt Enterprises, are Santino Ferrucci and Sting Ray Robb.

On June 7, 1997, Foyt (as an owner) was involved in an incident that added to his reputation as a man of little patience. One of his drivers, Billy Boat, had been declared the winner of the inaugural IRL race at Texas Motor Speedway that had been held that night, and his other driver, Davey Hamilton, had come in second. However, Dutch driver Arie Luyendyk disputed Boat&#x27;s win, claiming that he was in the lead when a scoring error by USAC (who had scored all IRL races up until that time) gave Boat the checkered flag. When Luyendyk entered victory lane after the race to confront TMS general manager Eddie Gossage about the finish uttering obscenities, an irate Foyt approached Luyendyk from behind slapping and shoving him into a tulip bed (coincidentally given Luyendyk&#x27;s Dutch nationality). Luyendyk then requested a review of the race and a few days later, USAC reversed its position and declared Luyendyk the winner but Foyt kept the victory lane-awarded trophy. Following the controversy, the IRL relieved USAC of the scoring duties for its events.

Foyt also fielded cars in NASCAR.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Foyt married Lucy Zarr, of River Oaks, remaining together for more than 68 years, until Lucy&#x27;s death on April 5, 2023.

Jerry Foyt is the son of A.J. Foyt. Foyt is the grandfather of A. J. Foyt IV. Foyt is the grandfather and adoptive father of Larry Foyt. He is also the godfather of driver John Andretti. When not busy with the racing season, A. J. Foyt likes to spend time at the family Ranch, The Foyt Ranches located in Hockley, Texas and Del Rio, Texas.

The Foyts are also, via marriage, part of the ownership group of the Indianapolis Colts. A. J. Foyt IV is married to the daughter of Colts owner Jim Irsay.

<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, four events in rowing were contested, marking the introduction of the sport to the Olympic program. At the inaugural 1896 Games, the rowing competition was cancelled due to strong winds. The 1900 regatta was held on the Seine between the Courbevoie Bridge and the Asnières Bridge on 25 and 26 August. The length of the regatta course was . Two finals were held in the coxed four competition, with both finals being considered Olympic championships. Thus, there were a total of five rowing championships awarded.

==Medal summary==
==Participating nations==
A total of 108 rowers from 8 nations competed at the Paris Games:

==Coxswain mystery==

In the coxed pair event, the names of the coxswains for six of the seven crews entered are not known. Most of these were young French boys weighing about 25 kg, which the French crews employed to their advantage. The winning Dutch crew decided, after losing their heat, that their own coxswain was too heavy, and they recruited a French boy to steer the boat for the finals. The lad, name unknown, is believed likely to be the youngest Olympic gold medalist ever (previously estimated as between 7 and 10 years of age). Some estimate the boy was likely 12 to 14 years old. One researcher has made a case that this unknown cox could have been Giorgi Nikoladze (1888-1931) of Georgia, a future scientist and promulgator of Georgian sport.

<text>The Rolf Schock Prizes were established and endowed by bequest of philosopher and artist Rolf Schock (1933–1986). The prizes were first awarded in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1993 and, since 2005, are awarded every three years. It is sometimes considered the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in Philosophy. Each recipient receives SEK 600,000 (approximately US$55,000).

The Prizes are awarded in four categories and decided by committees of three of the Swedish Royal Academies:

*Logic and Philosophy (decided by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences)

<text>The Practice Statement [1966] 3 All ER 77 was a statement made in the House of Lords by Lord Gardiner LC on 26 July 1966 on behalf of himself and the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, that they would depart from precedent in the Lords in order to achieve justice.

==Background==
Until the year 1966, the House of Lords in the United Kingdom was bound to follow all of its previous decisions under the principle of &quot;stare decisis&quot;, even if this created &quot;injustice&quot; and &quot;unduly restrict(s) the proper development of the law&quot; (&quot;London Tramways Co. v London County Council&quot; [1898] AC 375). The Practice Statement 1966 is authority for the House of Lords to depart from their previous decisions. It does not affect the precedential value of cases in lower courts; all other courts that recognise the Supreme Court (formerly the House of Lords) as the court of last resort are still bound by Supreme Court (and House of Lords) decisions. Before this, the only way a binding precedent could be avoided was to create new legislation on the matter.

A germane example is the case of &quot;Anderton v Ryan&quot; (1985) where the House of Lords interpreted the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 in such a way as to make the Act virtually ineffective. Only one year later in &quot;R v Shivpuri&quot; (1986) Lord Bridge (a member of the erroneous majority in &quot;Anderton&quot;) acknowledged the error and said &quot;the Practice Statement is an effective abandonment of our pretension to infallibility. If a serious error embodied in a decision of this House has been distorted by the law, the sooner it is corrected the better&quot;.

By contrast, in &quot; Knuller v DPP&quot;, Lord Reid, who had previously given a strong dissenting judgment in &quot;Shaw v DPP&quot;, said while he still disagreed with the majority decision in that case, in the interests of certainty he would not overturn &quot;Shaw&quot; (even though the Practice Statement had given authority to do so).

Suggestions that a rigid adherence to &quot;stare decisis&quot; be dropped had been made prior to 1966, initially by Lord Wright in an article for the &quot;Cambridge Law Journal&quot; in 1943, and by Lord Gardiner and others in the 1963 book, &quot;Law Reform Now&quot;.

==Content==
This is the text of the Practice Statement:

==Reception==

Louis Blom-Cooper described the change brought about by the Practice Statement as being as if the Lords &quot;dropped a pebble into the judicial pool that produced not merely a few ripples but also a seismic wave in English juridicial thinking ... the story of that legally historic event displays the carapace of traditional English lawyers&#x27; disinclination readily to accept radical change and to the cautious application of such change, once it is ultimately conceded&quot;.

Following the passage of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom was established in 2009. It follows the precedent of its predecessor. In &quot;Austin v Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Southwark&quot; Lord Hope, writing for the majority, comments on the Practice Statement&#x27;s applicability to the new court:

== Invocations in case law ==

Between 1966 and the replacement of the House of Lords by the Supreme Court in 2010, the Practice Statement was explicitly invoked in 21 cases, including:

* &quot;Conway v Rimmer&quot;, overruling &quot;Duncan v Cammell Laird Co&quot;
* &quot;Herrington v British Railways Board&quot;, overruling &quot;Robert Addie &amp; Sons (Colliers) Ltd v Dumbreck&quot;
* &quot;R v Shivpuri&quot;, overruling &quot;Anderton v Ryan&quot;
* &quot;R v G&quot;, overruling &quot;R v Caldwell&quot;
* &quot;Murphy v Brentwood DC&quot;, overruling &quot;Anns v Merton LBC&quot;
* &quot;Crown v Adomako&quot;, overruling &quot;R v Zuckerberg&quot;

<text>Rolf Schock (; 5 April 1933 – 5 December 1986) was a Swedish–American philosopher and artist, born in Cap-d&#x27;Ail, France of German parents.

==Biography==

Schock was born at Cap-d&#x27;Ail on the French Riviera. His parents, who had left Germany, would eventually settle in the United States, where Schock would go on to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree in geology at the University of New Mexico. After completing a bachelor of arts in 1955, he pursued studies in philosophy and logic from 1956 to 1960 at the University of California, first in Berkeley and then in Los Angeles (UCLA), and in 1960 moved to Stockholm, Sweden, to specialize in theoretical philosophy at Stockholm University with a particular interest in free logic. He was awarded an intermediate post-graduate degree in 1964 and a Ph.D.

During the period 1964–1969 he also studied at the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm and he dedicated a lot of his time to painting and photography in addition to conducting research. He led a simple life as an independent scholar who was devoted to researching the field of logic and related areas in philosophy, and never held a permanent position, earning a living by temporary teaching assignments at universities and night-schools. For some years he was affiliated with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, where he taught a series of courses.

In 1986 Schock was killed in an accident in Berlin. To much surprise he left a large estate. Schock bequeathed half of the funds for prizes in the arts and sciences, and beginning in 1993, Schock Prizes () instituted by his will are awarded every two or three years.

In his later life Schock criticized Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

==Selected publications==

*&quot;Logics Without Existence Assumptions&quot; (1968)
*&quot;New Foundations for Concept Theory&quot; (1969)
*&quot;The Inconsistency of the Theory of Relativity&quot; (1981)
*&quot;On the Nature of Time&quot; (1983)

<text>In psychology, codependency is a theory that attempts to explain imbalanced relationships where one person enables another person&#x27;s self-destructive behavior, such as addiction, poor mental health, immaturity, irresponsibility, or under-achievement.

Definitions of codependency vary, but typically include high self-sacrifice, a focus on others&#x27; needs, suppression of one&#x27;s own emotions, and attempts to control or fix other people&#x27;s problems.

People who self-identify as codependent are more likely to have low self-esteem, but it is unclear whether this is a cause or an effect of characteristics associated with codependency.

==History==
The term &quot;codependency&quot; most likely developed in Minnesota in the late 1970s from &quot;co-alcoholic&quot;, when alcoholism and other drug dependencies were grouped together as &quot;chemical dependency&quot;. In Alcoholics Anonymous, it became clear that alcoholism was not solely about the addict, but also about the enabling behaviors of the alcoholic&#x27;s social network. The term &quot;codependent&quot; was first used to describe persons whose lives were affected through their involvement with a person with a substance use disorder, resulting in the development of a pattern of coping with life that was not healthy as a reaction to that other person&#x27;s substance abuse.

In 1986, psychiatrist Timmen Cermak wrote &quot;Diagnosing and Treating Co-Dependence: A Guide for Professionals&quot;. In that book and an article published in the &quot;Journal of Psychoactive Drugs&quot;, Cermak argued unsuccessfully for the inclusion of codependency as a separate personality disorder in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III-R&quot; (DSM-III-R).

Melody Beattie popularized the concept of codependency in 1986 with the book &quot;Codependent No More&quot;, which sold eight million copies, with updated editions released in 1992 and 2022. Drawing on her personal experience with substance abuse and caring for someone with it, she also interviewed people helped by Al-Anon. Beattie&#x27;s work formed the groundwork of a twelve-step organisation called Co-Dependents Anonymous, founded in 1986, although the group does not endorse any definition of or diagnostic criteria for codependency.

==Lack of formal definition==
Codependency has no established definition or diagnostic criteria within the mental health community. It has not been included as a condition in any edition of the DSM or ICD.

The concept of &quot;codependency&quot; carries three different levels of meaning:
* An instructive tool that, once explained to families, helps them normalize the feelings that they are experiencing and allows them to shift their focus from the dependent person to their own dysfunctional behavior patterns.
* A psychological concept, a shorthand means of describing and explaining human behavior.
* A psychological disorder, implying that there is a consistent pattern of traits or behaviors across individuals that can create significant dysfunction.

Discussion of codependency tends to approach the subject as a disorder, although there is no agreement that codependency is a disorder at all, or how such a disorder might be defined or diagnosed. Due to the lack such agreement, there is no established definition or diagnostic criteria of &quot;codependency&quot; within the mental health community, and it has not been included as a condition in any edition of the DSM or ICD.

The Medical Subject Heading utilized by the United States National Library of Medicine describes codependency as &quot;A relational pattern in which a person attempts to derive a sense of purpose through relationships with others.&quot;

In her self-help book, Melody Beattie proposed that, &quot;The obvious definition [of codependency] would be: being a partner in dependency. This definition is close to the truth but still unclear.&quot; Beattie elaborated, &quot;A codependent person is one who has let another person&#x27;s behavior affect him or her, and who is obsessed with controlling that person&#x27;s behavior.&quot; Therapist and self-help author Darlene Lancer expresses that &quot;A codependent is a person who can’t function from his or her innate self and instead organizes thinking and behavior around a substance, process, or other person(s).&quot; Lancer includes all addicts in her definition. She believes a &quot;lost self&quot; is the core of codependency.

Co-Dependents Anonymous, a self-help organization for people who seek to develop healthy and functional relationships, &quot;offer[s] no definition or diagnostic criteria for codependence,&quot; but provides a list of &quot;patterns and characteristics of codependence&quot; that can be used by laypeople for self-evaluation. 
The community health organization, Mental Health America characterizes it as a form of &quot;relationship addiction&quot; in the sense that affected people have low-self esteem and high neediness, seeking fulfillment from external factors such as being needed by someone else, a situation that turn codependent when that someone is a dysfunctional family member.

==Theories==
According to theories of codependency as a psychological disorder, the codependent partner in a relationship is often described as displaying self-perception, attitudes and behaviors that serve to increase problems within the relationship instead of decreasing them. It is often suggested that people who are codependent were raised in dysfunctional families or with early exposure to addiction behavior, resulting in their allowance of similar patterns of behavior by their partner.

In an early attempt to define codependency as a diagnosable disorder, psychiatrist Timmen Cermak proposed, &quot;Co-dependence is a recognizable pattern of personality traits, predictably found within most members of chemically dependent families, which are capable of creating sufficient dysfunction to warrant the diagnosis of Mixed Personality Disorder as outlined in DSM III.&quot; Cermak listed the traits he identified in self-suppressing, supporting partners of people with chemical dependence or disordered personalities, and proposed a DSM-style set of diagnostic criteria. His proposal placed codependence within the framework of Mixed Personality Disorder, which is used to describe individuals who do not qualify for a single Personality Disorder diagnosis, but who have traits of several Personality Disorders.

Efforts to define and measure codependency include the Spann–Fischer Codependency Scale, proposed in 1990. That scale is predicated upon a definition of codependency as &quot;a dysfunctional pattern of relating to others with an extreme focus outside of oneself, lack of expression of feelings, and personal meaning derived from relationships with others.&quot;

As part of an effort to unify a definition of codependency, a 1994 review found that the definitions included in surveyed articles suggested &quot;an excessive reliance on other people for approval and for a sense of identity and purpose.&quot; A 2004 study found that definitions typically include high self-sacrifice, a focus on others&#x27; needs, suppression of one&#x27;s own emotions, and attempts to control or fix other people&#x27;s problems.

===Relationships===
Codependent relationships are often described as being marked by intimacy problems, dependency, control (including caretaking), denial, dysfunctional communication and boundaries, and high reactivity. There may be imbalance within the relationship, where one person is abusive or in control or supports or enables another person&#x27;s addiction, poor mental health, immaturity, irresponsibility, or under-achievement.

Under this conception of codependency, the codependent person&#x27;s sense of purpose within a relationship is based on making extreme sacrifices to satisfy their partner&#x27;s needs. Codependent relationships signify a degree of unhealthy &quot;clinginess&quot; and needy behavior, where one person does not have self-sufficiency or autonomy. One or both parties depend on their loved one for fulfillment.

===Personality disorders===
Codependency may occur within the context of relationships with people with diagnosable personality disorders.

*Borderline personality disorder – there is a tendency for loved ones of people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) to slip into &quot;caretaker&quot; roles, giving priority and focus to problems in the life of the person with BPD rather than to issues in their own lives. The codependent partner may gain a sense of worth by being perceived as &quot;the sane one&quot; or &quot;the responsible one.&quot;
*Narcissistic personality disorder – Narcissists, with their ability to get others to &quot;buy into their vision&quot; and help them make it a reality, seek and attract partners who will put others&#x27; needs before their own. A codependent person can provide the narcissist with an obedient and attentive audience. Among the reciprocally interlocking interactions of the pair are the narcissist&#x27;s overpowering need to feel important and special and the codependent person&#x27;s strong need to help others feel that way.

===Family dynamics===
In the dysfunctional family, the child learns to become attuned to the parent&#x27;s needs and feelings instead of the other way around. Parenting is a role that requires a certain amount of self-sacrifice and giving a child&#x27;s needs a high priority. A parent can be codependent toward their own child. Generally, a parent who takes care of their own needs (emotional and physical) in a healthy way will be a better caretaker, whereas a codependent parent may be less effective or may even do harm to a child. Codependent relationships often manifest through enabling behaviors, especially between parents and their children. Another way to look at it is that the needs of an infant are necessary but temporary, whereas the needs of the codependent are constant. Children of codependent parents who ignore or negate their own feelings may become codependent.

==Recovery and prognosis==
With no consensus as to how codependency should be defined, and with no recognized diagnostic criteria, mental health professionals hold a range of opinions about the diagnosis and treatment of codependency. Caring for an individual with a physical addiction is not necessarily a pathology. The caregiver may benefit from assertiveness skills and the ability to place responsibility for the addiction on the other.

Individuals who struggle with codependency may benefit from psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness practices.

Many self-help guides have been written on the subject of codependency. Self-help groups such as Co-Dependents Anonymous (CoDA), Al-Anon/Alateen, Nar-Anon, and Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACoA), which are based on the twelve-step program model of Alcoholics Anonymous, or Celebrate Recovery, a Christian twelve-step, Bible-based group, also provide support for recovery from codependency.

==Controversy==
As codependency is not a diagnosable mental health condition, there is no medical consensus as to its definition, and no evidence that codependency is caused by a disease process, the term becomes easily applicable to many behaviors and has been overused by some self-help authors and support communities. In an article in &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, clinician Kristi Pikiewicz suggested that the term &quot;codependency&quot; has been overused to the point of becoming a cliché, and labeling a patient as codependent can shift the focus on how their traumas shaped their current relationships.

Some scholars and treatment providers assert that codependency should be understood as a positive impulse gone awry, and challenge the idea that interpersonal behaviors should be conceptualized as addictions or diseases, as well as the pathologizing of personality characteristics associated with women. A study of the characteristics associated with codependency found that non-codependency was associated with masculine character traits, while codependency was associated with negative feminine traits, such as being self-denying, self-sacrificing,
or displaying low self-esteem.

<text>Rugby union at the 1900 Summer Olympics was played in Paris. Rugby union matches at the 1900 Summer Olympics were held on 14 October and 28 October. Forty-seven athletes competed, most from three nations and including a Haitian and a French-born American.

== Summary ==
France, represented by Union des Sociétés Françaises, Germany, represented mainly by the FC 1880 Frankfurt, and Great Britain, represented by the Moseley Wanderers, all participated in the inaugural rugby event at the Olympics. Only two games were contested, France played both Germany and Great Britain, the French winning both matches.

This saw the gold go to France, and both Germany and Great Britain are credited with silver, with no bronze awarded. For medal purposes, the IOC regards the side from France as a &quot;Mixed Team&quot;, as Constantin Henriquez was from Haiti. Further, André Roosevelt, an American born in France, was also on the French team.

==Results==
=== Match 1 ===
&lt;section begin=A1/&gt;
&lt;section end=A1/&gt;
In the first half, France scored a try by Émile Sarrade and a conversion. Germany scored tries by Heinrich Reitz and August Schmierer, with two conversions as well as a drop goal. Under the custom scoring rules of the Olympic tournament (3 points for tries or penalties, 2 points for conversions, 4 points for drop goals), this gave Germany a lead of 14–5.

The second half was vastly different, as Serrade scored two more tries while André Roosevelt also scored two and Frantz Reichel and Abel Albert added one each. Two more conversions were made, bringing France&#x27;s score to a total of 27. Germany, on the other hand, scored only one try, by one of the Ludwigs. France thus won the match 27–17.

=== Match 2 ===
&lt;section begin=A2/&gt;&lt;section end=A2/&gt;

The British team failed to score in the first half, while France continued the scoring barrage they had experienced in the second half of the Germany match. Sarrade scored two tries, bringing his tournament total to five. Joseph Olivier, Jean Collas, and Jean-Guy Gauthier each added a try. No conversions were scored, though André Rischmann&#x27;s two penalties brought France&#x27;s first-half total to 21.

Britain actually outscored France in the second half, 8–6, but had little chance of catching up. Joseph Wallis scored a try while J. Henry Birtles made a conversion and a penalty for Britain. Reichel scored his second try of the tournament, and Léon Binoche added a try to bring France&#x27;s victory to a 27–8 margin.

A Reuters report of the match noted that the British squad&#x27;s loss may have been in part to fatigue, as the players arrived in Paris only on the morning of the match. A crowd of 10,000 fans witnessed the match.

<doc id="228668" wikidata="Q2296408" url="?curid=228668" title="Suslin's problem">
<text>In mathematics, Suslin&#x27;s problem is a question about totally ordered sets posed by and published posthumously.
It has been shown to be independent of the standard axiomatic system of set theory known as ZFC; showed that the statement can neither be proven nor disproven from those axioms, assuming ZF is consistent.

(Suslin is also sometimes written with the French transliteration as , from the Cyrillic .)
==Formulation==
Suslin&#x27;s problem asks: Given a non-empty totally ordered set &quot;R&quot; with the four properties
# &quot;R&quot; does not have a least nor a greatest element;
# the order on &quot;R&quot; is dense (between any two distinct elements there is another);
# the order on &quot;R&quot; is complete, in the sense that every non-empty bounded subset has a supremum and an infimum; and
# every collection of mutually disjoint non-empty open intervals in &quot;R&quot; is countable (this is the countable chain condition for the order topology of &quot;R&quot;),
is &quot;R&quot; necessarily order-isomorphic to the real line R?

If the requirement for the countable chain condition is replaced with the requirement that &quot;R&quot; contains a countable dense subset (i.e., &quot;R&quot; is a separable space), then the answer is indeed yes: any such set &quot;R&quot; is necessarily order-isomorphic to R (proved by Cantor).

The condition for a topological space that every collection of non-empty disjoint open sets is at most countable is called the Suslin property.

==Implications==
Any totally ordered set that is &quot;not&quot; isomorphic to R but satisfies properties 1–4 is known as a Suslin line. The Suslin hypothesis says that there are no Suslin lines: that every countable-chain-condition dense complete linear order without endpoints is isomorphic to the real line. An equivalent statement is that every tree of height ω1 either has a branch of length ω1 or an antichain of cardinality ℵ1.

The generalized Suslin hypothesis says that for every infinite regular cardinal &quot;κ&quot; every tree of height &quot;κ&quot; either has a branch of length &quot;κ&quot; or an antichain of cardinality &quot;κ.&quot; The existence of Suslin lines is equivalent to the existence of Suslin trees and to Suslin algebras.

The Suslin hypothesis is independent of ZFC.
 and independently used forcing methods to construct models of ZFC in which Suslin lines exist. Jensen later proved that Suslin lines exist if the diamond principle, a consequence of the axiom of constructibility V = L, is assumed. (Jensen&#x27;s result was a surprise, as it had previously been conjectured that V = L implies that no Suslin lines exist, on the grounds that V = L implies that there are &quot;few&quot; sets.) On the other hand, used forcing to construct a model of ZFC without Suslin lines; more precisely, they showed that Martin&#x27;s axiom plus the negation of the continuum hypothesis implies the Suslin hypothesis.

The Suslin hypothesis is also independent of both the generalized continuum hypothesis (proved by Ronald Jensen) and of the negation of the continuum hypothesis. It is not known whether the generalized Suslin hypothesis is consistent with the generalized continuum hypothesis; however, since the combination implies the negation of the square principle at a singular strong limit cardinal—in fact, at all singular cardinals and all regular successor cardinals—it implies that the axiom of determinacy holds in L(R) and is believed to imply the existence of an inner model with a superstrong cardinal.

<text>Donald Glenn Garlits (born January 14, 1932) is an American race car driver and automotive engineer. Born in Tampa, Florida, Garlits is considered the father of drag racing, he is known as &quot;Big Daddy&quot; to drag racing fans around the world. A pioneer in the field of drag racing, he perfected the rear-engine Top Fuel dragster, an innovation motivated by the loss of part of his foot in a dragster accident. This design was notably safer since it put most of the fuel processing and rotating parts of the dragster behind the driver. The driver was placed in front of nearly all the mechanical components, thus protecting him and allowing him to activate a variety of safety equipment in the event of catastrophic mechanical failure or a fire. Garlits was an early promoter of the full-body, fire-resistant Nomex driving suit, complete with socks, gloves, and balaclava.

Garlits was the first drag racer to officially surpass the 170, 180, 200, 240, 250, and 270 mile-per-hour marks in the quarter mile; he was also the first to top in the . He has been inducted into several Halls of Fame and has won many awards during his career.

==Career==

===Early days===

After World War II, in the central and western United States, many air force bases and landing fields were decommissioned. These abandoned runways were perfect for drag racing. Don Garlits&#x27;s first drag race car was built under an oak tree at his home in North Tampa in 1954. He used an arc welder and a cutting torch to modify an old 1927 Ford Model T Roadster. To this roadster he added a 1948 Mercury engine block, a 1939 Ford floor shift transmission, and a 1948 Ford differential and axle. That early T-Bucket&#x27;s quarter mile performance was 13.5 seconds, at a top speed of 93 mph. It was this successful, formative roadster that would become the basis for his first rail-job dragster. He cut off the body panels, moved the engine back, and installed the seat behind the drive axle. (A similar design was built that same year by Mickey Thompson.) This was the legendary slingshot dragster with which Big Daddy would win the first NHRA race he entered, the NHRA Safety Safari in Lake City, Florida (12.1 seconds, 108 mph). Three years later, he became a professional drag racer. The first national drag racing meet, sponsored by the National Hot Rod Association was held on an airfield near Great Bend, KS in 1955. Don Garlits, being from Florida, was something of an outsider. He was sometimes referred to as the Floridian, before permanently adopting the nickname &quot;Swamp Rat,&quot; which also became the name for each new generation of his innovative dragster designs.

In 1959, Garlits traveled to Bakersfield, California for the US Fuel and Gas Championships, later to be named the &quot;March Meet&quot;, to show that the times he was setting were as legitimate as those set by the west coast racers. Over 30,000 people attended the event, the largest attendance at a drag race at that point. His presence helped to grow the sport of drag racing beyond its California base. In 1964, after winning the U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis, Garlits traveled to England, with TV Tommy Ivo, Tony Nancy, Dante Duce and other racers, to participate in the first International Drag Festival, a six-event series that did much to promote the sport of drag racing in the UK.

===Accident leads to innovation===
On March 8, 1970, at Lions Drag Strip, Garlits was driving &quot;Swamp Rat XIII&quot;, also called the &quot;Wynnscharger&quot;, a front-engined slingshot rail dragster, when the vehicle suffered a catastrophic failure. The two-speed transmission Garlits was developing exploded and took a piece out of his right foot, while the car broke in half in front of the cockpit; he was out for the remainder of the season. In an interview by Florida Trend, Garlits said this of the incident: &quot;In 1970, the transmission exploded in my dragster on the final run, and it cut my foot off and cut the car in two. That’s when I drew up plans for what I thought would be a championship rear-engine car. I would go out to the shop in Seffner on my wheelchair, saw stuff out on the band saw and make the parts.&quot;

Garlits&#x27;s accident was like many in the 1960s, and his new design followed several other pioneer designers of rear-engined dragsters, including Steve Swaja&#x27;s AA/Gas &quot;Wedge I&quot; from 1963, Roger Lindwall&#x27;s 1966 Top Fuel &quot;Re-Entry&quot;, and Kent Fuller&#x27;s fueller &quot;Sidewinder III&quot; from 1969. He was aided in the construction of his new car by T. C. Lemons and Connie Swingle.

===The first modern &quot;back-motor digger&quot;===
Garlits returned to Pomona in 1971 with &quot;Swamp Rat XIV&quot;, a brand new mid-engined, front-cockpit rail, also dubbed the &quot;Swamp Rat I-R&quot; by &quot;Hot Rod&quot; in the article introducing it to their readers. The rodding magazines considered the disadvantages of the new dragster design &quot;obvious,&quot; and, indeed, Garlits lost in his first outing with the new car, to Gary Cochran at Lions Drag Strip.

However, &quot;Swamp Rat XIV&quot; became so successful that in 1971, Garlits won two of his next three Top Fuel Eliminator titles (the Winternats and Bakersfield), and was a runner-up at Lions, all in the new car. A change so momentous had not happened since Mickey Thompson moved the seat behind the rear axle to create the Panorama City Special slingshot rail dragster in 1954. Rear engine dragsters have since become mainstream in drag racing.

In 1977, Ed Donovan persuaded Garlits to switch from the 426 hemi he had been using for the last thirteen years to the Donovan , offering (in Garlits&#x27; words) &quot;an engine deal I couldn’t refuse&quot;.

Garlits took a brief hiatus, returning to NHRA Top Fuel full-time in 1984.

===Further accomplishments===
Garlits has won ten American Hot Rod Association championships, four International Hot Rod Association championships, and three National Hot Rod Association championships, a total of 17. He was age 54 when he won the last. He won a total of 144 national events. On October 20, 1987, his dragster &quot;Swamp Rat XXX&quot;, the sport&#x27;s only successful streamlined fueler, was enshrined in National Museum of American History, a branch of The Smithsonian museum in Washington, DC. In true Garlits style, during the press conference submission and placement ceremony, the dragster was fired up on the Smithsonian &quot;porch.&quot;

===Retirement and post-racing career===
In 1987, Garlits suffered a blowover at the AHRA World Finals in Spokane, Washington. He received several injuries from the resulting crash. Though none were life-threatening, he temporarily retired from active driving and became a color commentator for NHRA telecasts on TNN and NBC. He announced for four seasons, from 1988 through the end of 1991. In December 1991 Garlits came out of retirement to race in the Snowbird Nationals, but his comeback was to be short-lived. &quot;Big Daddy&quot; retired again before the end of the 1992 season because of a detached retina, a product of the 4g deceleration produced by a Top Fuel Dragster&#x27;s braking parachutes.

Garlits resumed his career briefly in 1998, and again in 2003. His last qualifying race was in May 2003 at the NHRA POWERade Drag Racing Series, 23rd annual Summit Racing Equipment NHRA Southern Nationals presented by Pontiac in Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of 71 years, 5 months and 19 days he qualified 16th, setting a personal best speed in the quarter mile with a time of 4.788 seconds at 319.98 mph. Garlits had reached 323.04 earlier in the year at the 2003 Gatornationals. Mr. Garlits lost in first-round competition with his Summit Racing-Mono Winged Dragster, clocking in with a 0.064 reaction time, a personal best 4.737 elapsed time, and 307.44 mph, second only to Brandon Bernstein&#x27;s (son of racing legend Kenny Bernstein) Budweiser/Lucas Oil Dragster 0.079 reaction time, a 4.615 elapsed time, at 321.42 miles per hour. The difference at the finish line was only 122 thousandths of a second.

Garlits operates the Don Garlits Museum of Drag Racing on the grounds of his home in Ocala, Florida. He can also be seen from time to time on ESPN and Speed Vision doing commentary at racing events and performance expositions.

Always at the forefront of driver safety, in the wake of Funny Car driver Scott Kalitta&#x27;s fatal crash and numerous other engine explosions and resultant fires, occurring in the last 300 feet of the quarter mile, Garlits declared &quot;I am 100 percent in favor of it&quot;, regarding NHRA&#x27;s proposal to trim the race distance for Top Fuel and Funny Car from the traditional quarter-mile to 1,000 feet, also suggesting that he would support a ban on rev limiters and a return to a 70/30 nitromethane to methanol ratio. He has since had second thoughts.

In September 2009, Garlits returned to the quarter mile, racing a specially prepared 2009 Dodge Challenger in the Stock class at the U.S. Nationals at the Indianapolis Raceway Park, losing to Dan Fletcher in the first round.

In May 2014 at age 82, Garlits set a speed record with Swamp Rat 37, a 2,000 hp battery-powered EV dragster . In July 2019 at age 87, he set a new quarter-mile record of with Swamp Rat 38, a 1,500 lb dragster with a battery-powered 800 hp electric motor.

He is a mentor of current NHRA Top Fuel racer and fellow Ocala, Florida resident, Josh Hart.

===Political affiliation===
In 1994, Garlits was the Republican Party nominee for Florida&#x27;s 5th Congressional District. He was defeated by incumbent Democrat Karen Thurman. He supported the Republican candidacy of Ron Paul for President in 2008.

<doc id="228671" wikidata="Q116072" url="?curid=228671" title="Friedrich Miescher">
<text>Johannes Friedrich Miescher (13 August 1844 – 26 August 1895) was a Swiss physician and biologist. He was the first scientist to isolate nucleic acid in 1869. Miescher also identified protamine and made several other discoveries.

Miescher had isolated various phosphate-rich chemicals, which he called &quot;nuclein&quot; (now nucleic acids), from the nuclei of white blood cells in Felix Hoppe-Seyler&#x27;s laboratory at the University of Tübingen, Germany, paving the way for the identification of DNA as the carrier of inheritance. The significance of the discovery, first published in 1871, was not at first apparent, and Albrecht Kossel made the initial inquiries into its chemical structure. Later, Miescher raised the idea that the nucleic acids could be involved in heredity and even posited that there might be something akin to an alphabet that might explain how variation is produced.

==Early life and education==
Friedrich Miescher came from a scientific family; his father and his uncle held the chair of anatomy at the University of Basel. As a boy, Miescher was shy but intelligent. He had an interest in music as his father performed publicly. Miescher studied medicine at Basel, and in the summer of 1865, he worked for the organic chemist Adolf Stecker at the University of Göttingen. However, Miescher&#x27;s studies were interrupted for the year when he contracted typhoid fever, leaving him hearing-impaired. Miescher received his MD in 1868.

==Career==
Miescher felt that his partial deafness would be a disadvantage as a doctor, so he turned to physiological chemistry. Miescher originally wanted to study lymphocytes, but was encouraged by Felix Hoppe-Seyler to study neutrophils. Miescher was interested in studying the chemistry of the nucleus. Lymphocytes were difficult to obtain in sufficient numbers to study, while neutrophils were known to be one of the main and first components in pus and could be obtained from bandages at the nearby hospital. However, the problem was washing the cells off the bandages without damaging them.

Miescher devised different salt solutions, eventually producing one with sodium sulfate. The cells were filtered, and since centrifuges were not available at the time, the cells were allowed to settle to the bottom of a beaker. He then tried to isolate the nuclei free of cytoplasm. Miescher subjected the purified nuclei to an alkaline extraction followed by acidification, resulting in the formation of a precipitate that he called &quot;nuclein&quot; (now known as DNA). Miescher found that this contained phosphorus and nitrogen, but not sulfur. The discovery was so unlike anything else at the time that Hoppe-Seyler repeated all of Miescher&#x27;s research himself before publishing it in his journal. Miescher then went on to study physiology at Leipzig in the laboratory of Carl Ludwig for a year before being appointed professor of physiology.

While analyzing the composition of salmon sperm, Miescher also discovered the alkaline substance protamine, the account of which he published in 1874. It later found use, as protamine sulfate, in the stabilization of insulin (NPH insulin) and also as a reversal agent for the anticoagulant medicine heparin.

Miescher and his students researched much nucleic acid chemistry, but its function remained unknown. However, Miescher&#x27;s discovery played an important part in the identification of nucleic acids as the carriers of inheritance. The importance of his discovery was not apparent until Albrecht Kossel (a German physiologist specializing in the physiological chemistry of the cell and its nucleus and of proteins) researched the chemical structure of nuclein.

Miescher is also known for demonstrating that carbon dioxide concentrations in blood regulate breathing.

==Personal life==
Miescher was married to Maria Anna Rüsch. He died of tuberculosis in 1895 at the age of 51.

==Legacy==
As of 2008, two laboratories have been named after Miescher:
The Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society in Tübingen and the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, founded in 1970 by Ciba-Geigy.

<text>Ernest Jennings Ford (February 13, 1919 – October 17, 1991), known professionally as Tennessee Ernie Ford, was an American singer and television host who enjoyed success in the country and western, pop, and gospel musical genres. Noted for his rich bass-baritone voice and humor, he is remembered for his hit recordings of &quot;The Shotgun Boogie&quot; and &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Ford was born in Fordtown, Tennessee, United States, to Maud (née Long) and Clarence Thomas Ford. He spent much of his time in his early years listening to country or western musicians, in person or on the radio.

Ford began wandering around Bristol, Tennessee in his high school years, taking an interest in radio and began his radio career as an announcer at WOPI in 1937, being paid 10 dollars a week. In 1938, the young bass-baritone left the station and went to study classical music at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music in Ohio. He returned for the announcing job in 1939 and did it from 1939 to 1941 in stations from Atlanta, GA to Knoxville, TN. A first lieutenant, he served in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II as the bombardier on a B-29 Superfortress, but the war ended before he was to be sent to Japan. He was also a bombing instructor at George Air Force Base, in Victorville, California.

After the war, Ford worked at radio stations in San Bernardino and Pasadena, California. At KFXM, in San Bernardino, Ford was hired as a radio announcer. He was assigned to host an early morning country music disc jockey program, &quot;Bar Nothin&#x27; Ranch Time&quot;. To differentiate himself, he created the personality of &quot;Tennessee Ernie&quot;, a wild, madcap, exaggerated hillbilly. He became popular in the area and was soon hired away by Pasadena&#x27;s country radio station KXLA. He also did musical tours. The Mayfield Brothers of West Texas, including Smokey Mayfield, Thomas Edd Mayfield, and Herbert Mayfield, were among Ford&#x27;s warmup bands, having played for him in concerts in Amarillo and Lubbock, during the late 1940s.

At KXLA, Ford continued doing the same show and also joined the cast of Cliffie Stone&#x27;s popular live KXLA country show &quot;Dinner Bell Roundup&quot; as a vocalist while still doing the early morning broadcast. Cliffie Stone, a part-time talent scout for Capitol Records, brought him to the attention of the label. In 1949, while still doing his morning show, he signed a contract with Capitol. He became a local TV star as the star of Stone&#x27;s popular Southern California &quot;Hometown Jamboree&quot; show. RadiOzark produced 260 15-minute episodes of &quot;The Tennessee Ernie Show&quot; on transcription disks for national radio syndication.

He released almost 50 country singles through the early 1950s, several of which made the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Many of his early records, including &quot;The Shotgun Boogie&quot; and &quot;Blackberry Boogie&quot;, were exciting, driving boogie-woogie records featuring accompaniment by the &#x27;Hometown Jamboree&#x27; band, which included Jimmy Bryant on lead guitar and pioneer pedal steel guitarist Speedy West. &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Be Free&quot;, a duet pairing Ford with Capitol Records pop singer Kay Starr, became a huge country and pop crossover hit in 1950. A duet with Ella Mae Morse, &quot;False Hearted Girl&quot; was a top seller for the Capitol Country and Hillbilly division.

Ford eventually ended his KXLA morning show and in the early 1950s, moved on from &quot;Hometown Jamboree&quot;. He took over from bandleader Kay Kyser as host of the TV version of NBC quiz show &quot;College of Musical Knowledge&quot; when it returned briefly in 1954 after a four-year hiatus. He became a household name in the U.S., largely as a result of his portrayal of &quot;Cousin Ernie&quot; in the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episodes &quot;Tennessee Ernie Visits&quot;, &quot;Tennessee Ernie Hangs On&quot; (both 1954) and &quot;Tennessee Bound&quot; (1955). In 1955, Ford recorded &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot; (which reached number 4 on the country music chart) with &quot;Farewell to the Mountains&quot; on the B-side.

=== &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; cover version success ===

Ford scored an unexpected hit on the pop chart in 1955 with his rendering of &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;, a sparsely arranged coal-miner&#x27;s lament. Merle Travis had first recorded it in 1946. It reflected experiences of the Travis family in the mines at Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The song&#x27;s fatalistic tone and bleak imagery were in stark contrast to some sugary pop ballads and rock &amp; roll also on the charts in 1955:

With Ford&#x27;s snapping fingers and a unique clarinet-driven pop arrangement by Ford&#x27;s music director, Jack Fascinato, &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; spent ten weeks at number one on the country chart and seven weeks at number one on the pop chart. The record sold over two million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The song made Ford a crossover star, and became his signature song.

===&quot;The Ford Show&quot;===

Ford subsequently hosted his own prime-time variety program, &quot;The Ford Show&quot;, which ran on NBC television from October 4, 1956, to June 29, 1961. Ford&#x27;s last name allowed the show title to carry a unique double entendre by selling the naming rights to the Ford Motor Company (Ford had no known relation to the Ford family who founded that company). The &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;, an anthology series also sponsored by the company, had run in the same time slot on NBC in the preceding 1955–1956 season. Ford&#x27;s program was notable for the inclusion of a religious song at the end of every show, a tradition he recalled during his days as a cast member on Cliffie Stone&#x27;s &quot;Hometown Jamboree&quot; live radio and TV show. Ford insisted on ending with a hymn on his own show despite objections from network officials and the ad agency representing Ford, who feared it might provoke controversy. Everyone relented after the hymns received overwhelmingly favorable viewer response. The hymn became the most popular segment of his show. He earned the nickname &quot;The Ol&#x27; Pea-Picker&quot; due to his catchphrase, &quot;Bless your pea-pickin&#x27; heart!&quot; He began using the term during his disc jockey days on KXLA.

=== Later years ===
In 1956, he released &quot;Hymns&quot;, his first gospel music album, which remained on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Album charts for 277 consecutive weeks; his album &quot;Great Gospel Songs&quot; won a Grammy Award in 1964 and was nominated for several others. After the NBC show ended, Ford moved his family to Portola Valley in northern California. He also owned a cabin near Grandjean, Idaho, on the upper South Fork of the Payette River, where he would regularly retreat. In 1961, he recorded two albums of American Civil War songs, one for songs of the Union and another for songs of the Confederacy.

From 1962 to 1965, Ford hosted a daytime talk/variety show, &quot;The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show&quot; (later known as &quot;Hello, Peapickers&quot;) from KGO-TV in San Francisco, broadcast over the ABC television network. In 1968, Ford narrated the Rankin/Bass Thanksgiving TV special &quot;The Mouse on the Mayflower&quot; for NBC. The mouse narrator seen at the beginning of the special, William the Churchmouse, was a caricature of Ford, in keeping with a Rankin/Bass tradition. Ford was the spokesman for the Pontiac Furniture Company in Pontiac, Illinois, in the 1970s. He also became the spokesman for Martha White brand flour in 1972.

Although he left his own TV show, he went on other shows like &quot;Hee Haw&quot; in the 1970s, &quot;The Dolly Show&quot; and on &quot;Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters&quot; in the early 1980s.

Ford left Capitol Records in 1975. By that time, the quality of his country albums had become uneven and none of his releases were selling well. He would never record for a major label again.

Ford&#x27;s experiences as a navigator and bombardier in World War II led to his involvement with the Confederate Air Force (now the Commemorative Air Force), a war plane preservation group in Texas. He was a featured announcer and celebrity guest at the annual CAF Airshow in Harlingen, Texas, from 1976 to 1988. He donated a once-top-secret Norden bombsight to the CAF&#x27;s B-29 bomber restoration project. In the late 1970s, as a CAF colonel, Ford recorded the organization&#x27;s theme song &quot;Ballad of the Ghost Squadron&quot;.

Over the years, Ford was awarded three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for radio, records, and television. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1984, and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1990.

Out of the public eye, Ford and wife Betty contended with serious alcohol problems; Betty had the problem since the 1950s, as well as emotional issues that complicated both their lives and the lives of their sons. Though his drinking began to worsen in the 1960s, he worked continuously, seemingly unaffected by his heavy intake of whiskey. By the 1970s, however, it had begun to take an increasing toll on his health, appearance and ability to sing, though his problems were not known publicly. After Betty took her own life in 1989 because of prescription drug abuse, Ernie&#x27;s liver problems, diagnosed years earlier, became more apparent, but he refused to reduce his drinking despite repeated doctors&#x27; warnings. His last interview was taped on September 23, 1991, by his long-time friend Dinah Shore for her TV show, and was later aired on December 4 that year.

Ford received posthumous recognition for his gospel music contributions by being added to the Gospel Music Association&#x27;s Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1994.

== Personal life ==

Ford was married to Betty Heminger from September 18, 1942, until her death on February 26, 1989. They had two sons: Jeffrey Buckner &quot;Buck&quot; Ford (born 1950); and Brion Leonard Ford (born 1952, in San Gabriel, California), who died on October 24, 2008, in White House, Tennessee, of lung cancer, aged 56. In 1980 Ford lived in the Smoke Tree neighborhood of Palm Springs, California.

Less than four months after Betty&#x27;s death in 1989, Ford married again. On September 28, 1991, he suffered severe liver failure at Dulles Airport, shortly after leaving a state dinner at the White House, hosted by then-President George H. W. Bush. Ford died in H. C. A. Reston Hospital Center, in Reston, Virginia, on October 17. Ford was interred at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto, California.

His second wife, Beverly Wood Ford (1921–2001), died 10 years after Ernie; her body was interred with his.

Ford was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, Epsilon Zeta chapter at East Tennessee State University as well as the Bohemian Club.

<text>Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562 was a landmark court decision in Scots delict law and English tort law by the House of Lords. It laid the foundation of the modern law of negligence in common law jurisdictions worldwide, as well as in Scotland, establishing general principles of the duty of care.

Also known as the &quot;Paisley Snail&quot; or &quot;Snail in the Bottle&quot; case, the case involved Mrs May Donoghue drinking a bottle of ginger beer in a café in Paisley, Renfrewshire. Unknown to her or anybody else, a decomposed snail was in the bottle. She fell ill, and subsequently sued the ginger beer manufacturer, Mr Stevenson. The House of Lords held that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to her, which was breached because it was reasonably foreseeable that failure to ensure the product&#x27;s safety would lead to harm to consumers. There was also a sufficiently proximate relationship between consumers and product manufacturers.

Prior to &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot;, liability for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly (trespass to the person) or indirectly (trespass on the case). Being made ill by consuming a noxious substance did not qualify as either, so the orthodox view was that Mrs Donoghue had no sustainable claim in law. However, the decision fundamentally created a new type of liability in law that did not depend upon any previously recognised category of tortious claims. This was an evolutionary step in the common law for tort and delict, moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a fault-based system that only required injury. This evolution was taken further in the later decision of &quot;Letang v Cooper&quot; [1965] 1 QB 232 when it was held that actions should not be jointly pleaded in trespass and negligence, but in negligence alone.

==Background and facts==

On the evening of Sunday 26 August 1928, during the Glasgow Trades Holiday, May Donoghue took a train to Paisley, Renfrewshire. In Paisley, she went to the Wellmeadow Café. A friend, who was with her, ordered a pear and ice for herself. Donoghue asked for a Scotsman ice cream float, a mix of ice cream and ginger beer. The owner of the café, Francis Minghella, brought over a tumbler of ice cream and poured ginger beer on it from a brown and opaque bottle labelled &quot;D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley&quot;. Although the bottle was labelled as Stevenson&#x27;s, McByde suggests it is possible it did not originally belong to him (Stevenson). Bottles were often reused, and in the process occasionally returned to the incorrect manufacturer. Moreover, Stevenson initially claimed he did not issue bottles matching the description provided by Donoghue.

Donoghue drank some of the ice cream float. When her friend poured the remaining ginger beer into the tumbler, a decomposed snail also floated out of the bottle. Donoghue claimed that she felt ill from this sight, complaining of abdominal pain. According to her later statements of facts, she was required to consult a doctor on 29 August and was admitted to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for &quot;emergency treatment&quot; on 16 September. She was subsequently diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock.

The ginger beer had been manufactured by David Stevenson, who ran a company producing both ginger beer and lemonade at 11 and 12 Glen Lane, Paisley, less than a mile away from the Wellmeadow Café. The contact details for the ginger beer manufacturer were on the bottle label and recorded by Donoghue&#x27;s friend.

Donoghue subsequently contacted and instructed Walter Leechman, a local solicitor and city councillor whose firm had acted for the claimants in a factually similar case, &quot;Mullen v AG Barr &amp; Co Ltd&quot;, less than three weeks earlier (see also &quot;George v Skivington&quot;).

Despite the ruling in &quot;Mullen&quot;, Leechman issued a writ on Donoghue&#x27;s behalf against Stevenson on 9 April 1929. The writ claimed £500 in damages, the same amount a claimant in &quot;Mullen&quot; had recovered at first instance, and £50 in costs. The total amount Donoghue attempted to recover would be approximately .

===Condescendences===
The full allegations made by Donoghue were presented in five condescendences, which claimed that Stevenson had a duty of care to Donoghue to ensure that snails did not get into his bottles of ginger beer, but that he had breached this duty by failing to provide a system to clean bottles effectively, a system that would usually be used in the business and was necessary given that the ginger beer was intended for human consumption. The ineffectiveness of the cleaning system was alleged to result from the bottles being left in places &quot;to which it was obvious that snails had freedom of access ... and in which, indeed, snails and snail trails were frequently found&quot;, an allegation described by lawyer and author Matthew Chapman as &quot;somewhat gratuitous&quot;. This breach of duty was alleged to have caused Donoghue&#x27;s subsequent illness.

Stevenson responded to the condescendences by denying that any of his bottles of ginger beer had contained snails and &quot;that the alleged injuries are grossly exaggerated ... any illness suffered by the [claimant] was due to the bad condition of her own health at the time&quot;. In response to the writ, Stevenson pleaded four main arguments:
* that the claim had no legal basis;
* that the facts could not be substantiated;
* that he had not caused Donoghue any injury;
* that the claimed amount was excessive.

===Legal background===
Injuries resulting from defective products were normally claimed on the basis of a contract of sale between the seller and the consumer. However, Donoghue had no contractual relationship with Minghella as she had not purchased the ginger beer; while her friend &quot;did&quot; have a contract through having placed the order, she had &quot;not&quot; suffered any injury. Moreover, neither had a contract with Stevenson, the manufacturer. Donoghue was therefore required to claim damages for negligence.

&quot;Ansell v Waterhouse&quot; had established in 1817 that legal liability could arise for an act or omission &quot;contrary to the duty which the law casts on him in the particular case&quot; (i.e. negligence). However, there was no general duty of care and therefore no general liability for negligent behaviour. Only limited exceptions to this rule were made in which duties were found in specific circumstances, most of which had a contractual background.

The most difficult precedent for Donoghue was &quot;Mullen v AG Barr &amp; Co Ltd&quot;, a recent (1929) Court of Session case. In &quot;Mullen&quot;, two children, John and Francis Mullen, and Jeanie Oribine had separately found dead mice in their bottles of ginger beer, manufactured by AG Barr &amp; Co Ltd, and claimed to have become ill through drinking the tainted liquid. In separate hearings in Glasgow and Greenock Sheriff Court respectively, Orbine was successful in claiming compensation while the Mullens were not. The losing parties of both cases appealed to the Court of Session.

At the Court of Session, the claimants argued that although there was no direct evidence that the manufacturer had been negligent in preparing the ginger beer, negligence could be presumed (res ipsa loquitur) from the mere presence of dead mice in ginger beer bottles. However, the court ruled against the claimants. The majority held that on a factual basis AG Barr &amp; Co Ltd had rebutted a presumption of negligence and that on a legal basis product manufacturers only owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumers if there was a contractual relationship between the parties; if the dangerousness of the product was intentionally withheld from the consumer (in which case there might also be a claim for fraud); or if there was no warning of the intrinsic dangerousness of certain products, such as explosives. 

Only Lord Hunter dissented, finding that negligence to be inferred and that the fact that the bottle contents could not be examined (because of the dark glass) gave rise to a specific duty of care that would allow consumers to claim for damages.

However, neither of the circumstances in which negligence could be found in product liability cases applied to Donoghue: ginger beer is not intrinsically dangerous, nor did Stevenson intentionally misrepresent the threat it posed. Nevertheless, Donoghue&#x27;s counsel argued that manufacturers also owed a duty of care to their ultimate consumers if it was not possible to examine the goods before they were used, an exception that would apply to Donoghue.

==Judgment==
===Court of Session, Outer House===

The first interlocutory action was heard on the Court of Session on 21 May 1929 in front of Lord Moncrieff. After an adjournment, Minghella was added as a defender on 5 June; however, the claim against him was abandoned on 19 November, likely due to his lack of contractual relationship with Donoghue (Donoghue&#x27;s friend had purchased the ginger beer) and his inability to examine the contents of the dark glass bottle. On 12 December, Minghella and Stevenson were awarded a combined costs claim of £108 6s 3d against Donoghue for this abandoned strand of litigation. However, it was recorded on 20 December that Donoghue did not pay the costs awarded to Minghella.

The case was heard by Lord Moncrieff in the Outer House on 27 June 1930. In his judgment, delivered on the same day, he held that, as a general principle, there should be liability for negligent preparation of food.
I am unhesitatingly of opinion that those who deal with the production of food or produce fluids for beverage purposes ought not to be heard to plead ignorance of the active danger which will be associated with their products, as a consequence of any imperfect observation of cleanliness at any stage in the course of the process of manufacture ... Tainted food when offered for sale is, in my opinion, amongst the most subtly potent of &#x27;dangerous goods&#x27;, and to deal in or prepare such food is highly relevant to infer a duty. I fail to see why the fact that the danger has been introduced by an act of negligence and does not advertise itself, should release the negligent manufacturer from a duty, or afford him a supplementary defence.

English case law that required that liability for injuries resulting from goods that were not intrinsically dangerous to have a contractual basis (breach of warranty) was dismissed by Lord Moncrieff (citing John Salmond) for the narrowness of the approach and because there was no decision that incorporated it into Scots law. Finally, &quot;Mullen&quot;, despite its factual similarity, was discounted by a &quot;very close reading of the precedent opinions&quot;.

===Court of Session, Inner House===
Stevenson appealed the case to the Inner House, where it was heard by the same four judges who had found against Mullen: Lord Alness (the Lord Justice-Clerk), Lord Ormidale, Lord Hunter and Lord Anderson. In their judgment, given on 13 November 1930, they all referred back to and supported their statements in &quot;Mullen&quot;, Lord Alness observing that &quot;the only difference – and, so far as I can see, it is not a material difference – between that case [&quot;Mullen&quot;] and this case [&quot;Donoghue&quot;] is that there we were dealing with a mouse in a ginger-beer bottle, and here we are dealing with a snail in a ginger-beer bottle&quot;. Thus, Lord Alness, Lord Ormidale and Lord Anderson all allowed the appeal while Lord Hunter dissented.

===House of Lords===
Donoghue filed a petition to appeal to the House of Lords on 25 February 1931. She also sought (and subsequently received) permission to pursue the case &quot;in forma pauperis&quot; (with the status of a pauper) – a status she had not, for unknown reasons, sought at the Court of Session – providing an affidavit declaring that &quot;I am very poor, and am not worth in all the world the sum of five pounds, my wearing apparel and the subject matter of the said appeal only excepted&quot;. This claim was supported by the minister and two elders of her church and meant that Donoghue was not required to provide security for costs in case she lost the appeal. (Her legal team had agreed to work &quot;pro bono&quot;.)
The petition was granted and the appeal was heard 10 and 11 December 1931 by Lord Buckmaster, Lord Atkin, Lord Tomlin, Lord Thankerton and Lord Macmillan. A supplementary statement from Donoghue&#x27;s appeal papers indicates that her counsel, George Morton KC and William Milligan (later the Lord Advocate and a Privy Counsellor), argued that &quot;where anyone performs an operation, such as the manufacture of an article, a relationship of duty independent of contract may in certain circumstance arise, the extent of such duty in every case depending on the particular circumstances of the case&quot;. Stevenson, they argued, owed a duty to take reasonable care in the manufacture of his ginger beer because the sealed bottles were opaque, and therefore could not be examined, and because the ginger beer was intended for human consumption.

Stevenson&#x27;s counsel, Wilfrid Normand KC (Solicitor General for Scotland and later a Law Lord) and James Clyde (later the Lord President of the Court of Session and a Privy Counsellor), responded that &quot;it is now firmly established both in English and Scottish law that in the ordinary case (which this is) the supplier or manufacturer of an article is under no duty to anyone with whom he is not in contractual relation&quot;. They denied that ginger beer was intrinsically dangerous or that Stevenson knew that the product was dangerous (the two established exceptions for finding a duty of care) and argued that the third exception that Donoghue was attempting to introduce had no basis in precedent.

The House of Lords gave judgment on 26 May 1932 after an unusually long delay of over five months since the hearing. The court held by a majority of 3–2 that Donoghue&#x27;s case disclosed a cause of action. The majority consisted of Lord Atkin, Lord Thankerton and Lord Macmillan.

Lord Atkin commented that he did &quot;not think a more important problem has occupied your Lordships in your judicial capacity, important both because of its bearing on public health and because of the practical test which it applies to the system under which it arises&quot;. He agreed with counsel, based on his own research, that Scots and English law were identical in requiring a duty of care for negligence to be found and explained his general neighbour principle on when that duty of care arises.

He supported this broad test by citing &quot;Heaven v Pender&quot; and rejected the cases in favour of a narrower interpretation of a duty of care with the example of negligently poisoned food, for which there had been no claim against the manufacturer. &quot;If this were the result of the authorities, I should consider the result a grave defect in the law, and so contrary to principle that I should hesitate long before following any decision to that effect which had not the authority of this House&quot;. He went on to suggest that there should be a duty of care owed by all manufacturers of &quot;articles of common household use&quot;, listing medicine, soap and cleaning products as examples. &quot;I do not think so ill of our jurisprudence as to suppose that its principles are so remote from the ordinary needs of civilised society and the ordinary claims it makes upon its members as to deny a legal remedy where there is so obviously a social wrong.&quot;

Lord Atkin then rejected cases that did not support his approach and cited Benjamin N. Cardozo in the New York case &quot;MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.&quot; in favour of his view.

He concluded:

Lord Thankerton ruled that Donoghue had no contract with Stevenson, nor that her case was covered by one of the scenarios in which a duty of care had previously been found. However, he held that where goods could not be examined or interfered with, the manufacturer had &quot;of his own accord, brought himself into direct relationship with the consumer, with the result that the consumer [was] entitled to rely upon the exercise of diligence by the manufacturer to secure that the article shall not be harmful to the consumer&quot;, an exception to the general nonexistence of a duty of care that applied to Donoghue.

Lord Thankerton further argued that it was impossible &quot;to catalogue finally, amid the ever-varying types of human relationships, those relationships in which a duty to exercise care arises apart from contract&quot; and commented that he &quot;should be sorry to think that the meticulous care of the manufacturer to exclude interference or inspection by the [seller] should relieve the [seller] of any responsibility to the consumer without any corresponding assumption of duty by the manufacturer&quot;.

Lord Macmillan examined previous cases and held that &quot;the law takes no cognisance of carelessness in the abstract. It concerns itself with carelessness only where there is a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage&quot;. Whether there was a duty and breach would be examined by the standard of the reasonable person. These circumstances &quot;must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The categories of negligence are never closed&quot;. 

Lord Macmillan held that, according to this standard, Stevenson had demonstrated carelessness by leaving bottles where snails could access them; that he owed Donoghue a duty of care as commercial manufacturer of food and drink; and that Donoghue&#x27;s injury was reasonably foreseeable. He therefore found that Donoghue had a cause of action and commented that he was &quot;happy to think that in ... relation to the practical problem of everyday life which this appeal presents ... the principles of [English and Scots law] are sufficiently consonant with justice and common sense to admit of the claim which the appellant seeks to establish.&quot;

The minority consisted of Lord Buckmaster and Lord Tomlin. Lord Buckmaster focused on precedent, and commenced by warning that &quot;although [common law] principles are capable of application to meet new conditions not contemplated when the law was laid down, these principles cannot be changed nor can additions be made to them because any particular meritorious case seems outside their ambit&quot;. He held that there were only the two recognised exceptions to the finding of a duty of care and supported Baron Alderson&#x27;s judgment in &quot;Winterbottom v Wright&quot; that &quot;the only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract; if we go one step beyond that, there is no reason why we should not go fifty&quot;.

Lord Buckmaster dismissed &quot;George v Skivington&quot;, opining that &quot;few cases can have lived so dangerously and lived so long&quot;, and rejected &quot;Heaven&quot; as a &quot;tabula in naufragio&quot; (Latin: literally &quot;plank in a shipwreck&quot;) that was unrelated to Donoghue&#x27;s case; both &quot;should be buried so securely that their perturbed spirits shall no longer vex the law&quot;. He concluded that there was no common law support for Donoghue&#x27;s claim and supported Lord Anderson&#x27;s judgment in &quot;Mullen&quot;.

Lord Tomlin concurred with Lord Buckmaster. While he agreed with Lord Atkin that the duty of care a manufacturer owed to its consumers was the same regardless of the product they produced, he held that no general duty of care existed and that the fact the product was in a sealed container made no difference to the finding of a such duty. He further endorsed concerns that Lord Atkin&#x27;s broader test of liability would have allowed everyone injured in the Versailles rail accident to be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer of the axle that broke and caused the crash.

The suggested (Latin: the reason for the decision) of the case has varied from the narrowest, jokingly suggested by Julius Stone, that there was merely a duty &quot;not to sell opaque bottles of beverage containing dead snails to Scots widows&quot;, to the widest, suggested by Lord Normand, who had been one of Stevenson&#x27;s counsel, that Lord Atkin&#x27;s neighbour principle was the .

Although the neighbour principle was a critical part of Lord Atkin&#x27;s reasoning, and was therefore part of the of his judgment, neither of the other judges in the majority expressly endorsed the principle. Robert Heuston therefore suggests that case only supports the claims there can be duties in tort even if there is no contract; that manufacturers owe a duty of care to the ultimate consumers of their goods; and possibly that negligence is a separate tort. &quot;No amount of posthumous citation can of itself transfer with retrospective effect a proposition from the status of [passing comments] to that of .&quot;

===Subsequent events===
The legal basis for the claim now settled, the case was returned to the Court of Session for a hearing scheduled for January 1933. In the hearing, Donoghue would have to prove the factual elements of the case that she had claimed, including that there had been a snail in the ginger beer as a result of Stevenson&#x27;s negligence and that this snail had caused her illness. However, Stevenson died on 12 November 1932, aged 69. One year later, Stevenson&#x27;s executors were listed as third-party defenders to the case. However, the claim was settled out of court in December 1934 for, according to Leechman&#x27;s son, £200 of the £500 originally claimed.
Donoghue had moved to 101 Maitland Street with her son, Henry, around February 1931. He moved out when he married in 1937, after which she moved to 156 Jamieson Street. She continued to work as a shop assistant. In February 1945, Donoghue divorced her husband, from whom she had separated in 1928 and who now had two sons by another woman, and reverted to using her maiden name. 

She died of a heart attack on 19 March 1958, at the age of 59, in Gartloch Mental Hospital, where she had probably been staying for a short period of time as a result of mental illness. Although she is listed on her death certificate as May McAllister, she was by then commonly known as Mabel Hannah, having adopted her mother&#x27;s maiden name and the first name of her daughter, who had died when she was eleven days old.

Stevenson&#x27;s business was taken over by his widow, Mary, and his son, the third David Stevenson in the family. It became a limited company (David Stevenson (Beers and Minerals) Limited) on 1 July 1950; the family sold their shares in 1956. The Glen Lane manufacturing plant was demolished in the 1960s.

The Wellmeadow Café, where the snail had been found, closed around 1931; the building was demolished in 1959. Minghella, its owner, subsequently became a labourer; he died on 20 March 1970.

==Significance==
Lord Atkin&#x27;s neighbour principle, that people must take reasonable care not to injure others who could foreseeably be affected by their action or inaction, was supported by reference to the biblical Great Commandment (to love one’s neighbour as oneself) and the Parable of the Good Samaritan (defining who that “neighbour” was).

The neighbour principle itself was first mentioned in relation to law by Francis Buller in &quot;An Introduction to the Law relative to Trials at Nisi Prius&quot;, which was printed in 1768.

In precedent, there was an obiter suggestion by Lord Esher in &quot;Heaven v Pender&quot; that &quot;whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense ... would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct ... he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger&quot;. However, this approach had been rejected by the two other judges in the Court of Appeal. Lord Esher&#x27;s attempt to reintroduce the principle in further obiter remarks in &quot;Le Lievre v Gould&quot;, in which he stated that &quot;Heaven&quot; only established that there may be a duty even if there is no contract and that this duty arose if there was proximity between the parties, was also unsuccessful.

Two cases from the New York Court of Appeals, &quot;Thomas v. Winchester&quot; and &quot;MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.&quot;, were also influential in the formation of the neighbour principle. In &quot;Thomas&quot;, Thomas had purchased and administered belladonna to his wife after it was mislabelled by Winchester, the dealer, although not the seller, of the treatment as extract of dandelion. Thomas&#x27; wife became seriously ill as a consequence and Thomas successfully claimed in negligence; Winchester&#x27;s behaviour had created an imminent danger which justified a finding of a duty of care.

This principle was relied on in &quot;MacPherson&quot;, in which a car wheel collapsed, injuring MacPherson. The manufacturer was sued in negligence and the court held that manufacturers could owe their ultimate consumers a duty of care in limited circumstances.

Lord Atkin used the concept of legal neighbours in an address to the University of Birmingham&#x27;s Holdsworth Club on 9 May 1930, in which he commented that &quot;the man who swears unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not is a person commended by the law of morality, and the Law enforces that by an action for breach of contract&quot;. On 28 October 1931, just over one month before he heard &quot;Donoghue&quot;, Lord Atkin also used the principle in relation to defamation, perjury, fraud and negligence in a lecture at King&#x27;s College London.

===Precedent===
The case was reviewed by Frederick Pollock in a 1933 edition of &quot;Law Quarterly Review&quot;, in which he commented that there was no doubt as to the importance of the decision and that &quot;a notable step has been made in enlarging and clarifying our conception of a citizen&#x27;s duty before the law ... not to turn dangerous or noxious things loose on the world&quot;. However, &quot;Donoghue&quot; otherwise attracted little attention; it was understood only as precedent that manufacturers were liable for injuries their goods cause their ultimate consumers rather than that there was a general principle of liability in negligence. 

The majority of the Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Cohen and Lord Justice Asquith) therefore held in &quot;Candler v Crane, Christmas &amp; Co&quot; that &quot;Donoghue&quot; had not affected tortious liability for negligent misstatement. This narrow understanding of &quot;Donoghue&quot; changed with the cases of &quot;Hedley Byrne v Heller&quot; in 1963 and &quot;Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co&quot; in 1970.

===&quot;Hedley Byrne v Heller&quot;===
In &quot;Hedley Byrne&quot;, Hedley Byrne, advertising agents, had been indirectly informed by Heller &amp; Partners Ltd, the bankers of Easipower, a company wishing to place a large order, that Easipower was a &quot;respectably constituted company, considered good for its ordinary business engagements&quot;. Hedley Byrne relied on this information and subsequently lost over £17,000 when Easipower went into liquidation. The House of Lords held that Heller owed Hedley Byrne a duty of care as they used a special skill for Hedley Byrne and because this skill was relied upon by the company (although the negligence claim was unsuccessful due to a disclaimer of responsibility included in Heller&#x27;s letter).

The application of &quot;Donoghue&quot; was discussed and, while all the judges agreed that it would be taking &quot;Donoghue&quot; too far to immediately apply it to &quot;Hedley Byrne&quot;, Lord Devlin suggested that &quot;what Lord Atkin did was to use his general conception [the neighbour principle] to open up a category of cases giving rise to a special duty&quot; and that the case could incrementally expand the duty of care.

===&quot;Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co&quot;===

&quot;Home Office&quot; was the culmination of a movement from duties of care being found in specific circumstances to using the neighbour principle as a general duty of care. In &quot;Home Office&quot;, the Home Office had in 1962 taken a group of boys from a borstal to Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, where seven had escaped overnight and collided one yacht with another belonging to Dorset Yacht Company. The company sued the Home Office for negligence and a preliminary issue, whether the Home Office owed a duty of care to Dorset Yacht Company, was found in the company&#x27;s favour by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The case was appealed to the House of Lords, who held by a majority that the Home Office did owe a duty of care.

Lord Reid, giving the leading judgment, rejected the argument that there was no precedent for the claim, instead acknowledging &quot;a steady trend towards regarding the law of negligence as depending on principle so that, when a new point emerges, one should ask not whether it is covered by authority but whether recognised principles [from &quot;Donoghue&quot;] apply to it&quot;. &quot;Donoghue&quot;, he argued, should therefore be applied in almost all circumstances.

In the sole dissenting judgment, Viscount Dilhorne held that the neighbour principle could not have been intended to be applied in all circumstances and that it could only be used to determine to whom a duty of care is owed rather than if one exists. Judges, he opined, &quot;are concerned not with what the law should be but with what it is. The absence of authority shows that no such duty [to Dorset Yacht Company] now exists. If there should be one, that is, in my view, a matter for the legislature and not for the courts&quot;. Chapman comments &quot;that this conclusion appeared ... distinctly quaint, old-fashioned and even untenable in the light of [&quot;Donoghue&quot;] shows how far the law had moved in the four decades which separated the two House of Lords decisions&quot;.

===&quot;Caparo Industries plc v Dickman&quot;===
In 1990, the House of Lords revised Lord Atkin&#x27;s &quot;neighbour&quot; principle to encompass public policy concerns articulated in &quot;Caparo Industries plc v Dickman&quot;. The three-stage &quot;Caparo&quot; test for establishing a duty of care requires (i) foreseeability of damage, (ii) a relationship characterised by the law as one of proximity or neighbourhood and (iii) that the situation should be one in which the court considers it would be fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of given scope on one party for the benefit of the other. In other jurisdictions, such as New Zealand, there is now a two-part test for novel fact situations, where the establishment of a duty must be balanced against applicable policy matters.

===Comparative law===
The judgment and reasoning of Lord Atkin in &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot; is very similar to the judgment and reasoning applied by Cardozo CJ in the American case of &quot;Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.&quot;, four years earlier. Although the similarity in approach has been noted by commentators, the decision is &quot; Palsgraf&quot; was not cited in either argument or in the judgments in &quot;Donoghue&quot;, although Lord Atkin did refer to an earlier decision of Cardozo J: &quot;MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.&quot;.

===As a metaphor===
Today the far reaching changes of the decision for the law of torts is sufficiently well recognised that the case&#x27;s name is used as a metaphor. For example, &quot;Barclays Bank v W J Simms&quot; [1980] 1 QB 677 has been described as &quot;the &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot; of restitution for mistake.&quot; It has also been stated that &quot;Slade&#x27;s Case&quot; &quot;could be said to be the &quot;Donoghue v. Stevenson&quot; of contract.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd&quot; has been called &quot;the &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot; of Tourism Law&quot;.

===Commemoration===

In 1990, a pilgrimage to Paisley was organised by the Canadian Bar Association, the Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland. This included a conference in Paisley Town Hall entitled &quot;The Pilgrimage to Paisley: a Salute to &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot;&quot;. A memorial commemorating the case was unveiled at the conference on the site of the former Wellmeadow Café and a bench was added in 1992; both were replaced in 2012.

In 1996, retired Canadian judge Martin Taylor together with David Hay and Michael Doherty produced a documentary on the case: &quot;The Paisley Snail&quot;.

===Existence of the snail===

In a speech scheduled to be delivered in May 1942 (although delayed by the Second World War), Lord Justice MacKinnon jokingly suggested that it had been proven that Donoghue did not find a snail in the bottle.

This allegation, suggests Chapman, established itself as a legal myth; it was repeated by Lord Justice Jenkins in a 1954 Court of Appeal practice note. However, both MacKinnon and Jenkins were unaware that the trial had not gone ahead because of Stevenson&#x27;s death, and the events following the case were only published in response to the practice note. As Donoghue&#x27;s factual claims were therefore never tested in court, it is generally held that what happened in the Wellmeadow Café is not proven and will not be known for certain.

<text>Old Believers, also called Old Ritualists, are Eastern Orthodox Christians who maintain the liturgical and ritual practices of the Russian Orthodox Church as they were before the reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow between 1652 and 1666. Resisting the accommodation of Russian piety to the contemporary forms of Greek Orthodox worship, these Christians were anathematized, together with their ritual, in a Synod of 1666–67, producing a division in Eastern Europe between the Old Believers and those who followed the state church in its condemnation of the Old Rite. Russian speakers refer to the schism itself as &quot;raskol&quot; (), etymologically indicating a &quot;cleaving-apart&quot;.

The leaders of the Old Believers, including Avvakum Petrov and Ivan Neronov, were originally members of the Zealots of Piety. This group of church reformers gathered around Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich and the tsar&#x27;s confessor Stefan Vonifatyev in the late 1630s, and also included the future Patriarch of Moscow Nikon. Upon Nikon&#x27;s elevation to the patriarchal throne, he and the tsar hoped to revitalize the Russian Church through the ecumenical Eastern Orthodoxy of the Greek Church, introducing various Greek reforms to the liturgy. Old Believers believe these reforms to be heretical, believing the pre-reform rites to be the authentic practices of the early church. Old Believer theology is characterized by this strict adherence to pre-reform traditions, as well as the belief that the reformed church&#x27;s heresy is coeval with the arrival of the Antichrist.

As a result of this eschatological belief, as well as the church and state&#x27;s mass persecution of the Old Believers, many fled to establish colonies and monasteries in the wilderness. No bishops opposed Nikon&#x27;s reforms (besides Paul of Kolomna, who was banished to a monastery), so the Old Believers had no ability to ordain new priests, meaning the anti-reform priesthood would quickly vanish. This dilemma led to the split among the Old Believers into the Popovtsy (the priested ones) and the Bespopovtsy (the priestless ones); the Popovtsy accept priests ordained by the reformed Russian Church, while the Bespopovtsy reject any priest ordained after Nikonite reforms.

The widespread persecution of Old Believers came to an end with Tsar Nicholas II&#x27;s Edict of Tolerance in 1905. The total number of Old Believers at the beginning of the 20th century is difficult to estimate, as many still feared persecution for admitting their faith, but contemporary sources put the total between 10 and 20 million. Persecution was renewed in the Soviet era, ending during Gorbachev&#x27;s perestroika reforms of the Soviet Union. In the early 21st century, the number of Old Believers is estimated to be between 2 and 3 million, mostly in Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, and the United States.

== Introduction ==

In 1652, Nikon of Moscow, patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church from then until 1658, introduced a number of ritual and textual revisions with the aim of achieving uniformity between the practices of the Russian and Greek Orthodox churches. Nikon, having noticed discrepancies between Russian and Greek rites and texts, ordered an adjustment of the Russian rites to align with the Greek ones of his time.

In doing so, according to the Old Believers, Nikon acted without adequate consultation with the clergy and without gathering a council. After the implementation of these revisions, the Church anathematized and suppressed—with the support of Muscovite state power—the prior liturgical rite itself, as well as those who were reluctant to pass to the revised rite.

Those who maintained fidelity to the existing rite endured severe persecutions from the end of the 17th century until the beginning of the 20th century as &quot;Schismatics&quot; (, ). They became known as &quot;Old Ritualists&quot;, a name introduced under the empress Catherine the Great, who reigned from 1762 to 1796. Those who adopted new liturgical practices started to call themselves (, &#x27;those believing rightly&#x27;, &#x27;orthodox&#x27;).

==Prior to Nikon==
The installation of a Metropolitan of Kiev and All Russia, but resident in Moscow, by a council of Russian bishops in 1448 without consent from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople initiated the effective independence of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Grand Duchy of Moscow. By then, apart from Muslim and Jewish minorities and pagan subject peoples, the Russian people were Christianised, observing church festivals and marking births, marriages, and deaths with Orthodox rituals.

The main objectives of reformers in the 16th century, many from the secular clergy, were to standardise the liturgy throughout the Muscovite realm. This resulted in the holding of the Stoglavy Synod, a Russian church council in 1551, whose decrees formed the basis of Orthodox ritual and liturgy in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. This synod condemned many popular religious practices; among other things, it forbade the practice of polyphony. In addition, while stressing the need for accurate copying of sacred documents, it also approved of traditional Russian liturgical practices that differed from contemporary Greek ones.

==Origins of reform==
During the reign of Aleksei Mikhailovich (r. 1645–1676), the young tsar and his confessor, Stefan Vonifatiev, sponsored a group, mainly composed of non-monastic clergy and known as the Zealots of Piety. These included the archpriest Avvakum as a founder-member, as well as the future patriarch Nikon, who joined in 1649. Their original aim was to revitalise the parishes through effective preaching, the orderly celebration of the liturgy, and enforcement of the church&#x27;s moral teachings. To ensure that the liturgy was celebrated correctly, its original and authentic form had to be established, but the way that Nikon did this caused disputes between him and other reformers.

In 1646, Nikon first met Tsar Aleksei, who immediately appointed him archimandrite of the Novospassky monastery in Moscow. In 1649, Nikon was consecrated as the Metropolitan of Novgorod and, in 1652, he became Patriarch of Moscow. During his time in Novgorod, Nikon began to develop his view that the responsibility for the spiritual health of Russia lay with senior church leaders, not the tsar. When he became patriarch, he started to reorganise the church&#x27;s administration so it was wholly under his own control.

In 1649, a Greek delegation, headed by Patriarch Paisios of Jerusalem, arrived in Moscow and tried to convince the tsar and Nikon that current Greek liturgical practices were authentically Orthodox and that Russian usages that differed from them were local innovations. This led to a heated debate between the visiting Greeks and many Russian clerics who believed that, by accepting the decrees of the Council of Florence, the Greek patriarchate had compromised its authority and forfeited any right to dictate to Russia on liturgical matters. 
Tsar Aleksei, Nikon and some of the Zealots of Piety decided that the best way to revitalise the Russian church was to conform with the usages of the Greek church and accept the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople.

== Reforms of Nikon ==

By the middle of the 17th century, Greek and Russian Church officials, including Patriarch Nikon of Moscow, had noticed discrepancies between contemporary Russian and Greek usages. They reached the conclusion that the Russian Orthodox Church had, as a result of errors of incompetent copyists, developed rites and liturgical books of its own that had significantly deviated from the Greek originals. Thus, the Russian Orthodox Church had become dissonant with the other Orthodox churches.

The unrevised Muscovite service-books derived from a different, and older, Greek recension than that which was used in the current Greek books, which had been revised over the centuries, and contained innovations. Nikon wanted to have the same rite in the Russian tsardom as those ethnically Slavic lands, then the territories of Ukraine and Belarus, that were then part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, to attract local Orthodox rebels. Their rite was closer to the Greek than that in the Muscovite realm. Nikon did not accept the existence of two different rites in the same church.

Supported by Tsar Aleksei, Nikon carried out some preliminary liturgical reforms. In 1652, he convened a synod and exhorted the clergy on the need to compare Russian &quot;Typikon,&quot; &quot;Euchologion,&quot; and other liturgical books with their Greek counterparts. Monasteries from all over Russia received requests to send examples to Moscow to have them subjected to a comparative analysis. Such a task would have taken many years of conscientious research and could hardly have given an unambiguous result, given the complex development of the Russian liturgical texts over the previous centuries and the lack of textual historiographic techniques at the time.

Without waiting for the completion of any comparative analysis, Nikon overrode the decrees of the Stoglavy Synod and ordered the printing of new editions of the Russian psalter, missal, and a pamphlet justifying his liturgical changes. The new psalter and missal altered the most frequently used words and visible gestures in the liturgy, including the pronunciation of Christ&#x27;s name and making the sign of the cross. In addition, the overbearing manner in which he forced the changes through turned Avvakum and others of the Zealots of Piety against him. Their protests led to their excommunication and exile and, in some cases, imprisonment or execution.

It was not disputed by the reformers that the Russian texts should be corrected by reference to the most ancient Greek, but also Slavonic, manuscripts, although they also considered that many traditional Russian ceremonial practices were acceptable. In addition, the hastily published new editions of the service books contained internal inconsistencies, and had to be reprinted several times in quick succession. Rather than being revised according to ancient Slavonic and Greek manuscripts, the new liturgical editions had actually been translated from modern Greek editions printed in Catholic Venice.

The locum tenens for Patriarch Pitirim of Moscow convened the 1666 Great Moscow Synod, which brought Patriarch Macarius III Ibn al-Za&#x27;im of Antioch, Patriarch Paisios of Alexandria, and many bishops to Moscow. Some scholars allege that the visiting patriarchs each received both 20,000 rubles in gold and furs for their participation. This council officially established the reforms and anathematized not only all those opposing the innovations but the old Russian books and rites themselves as well. As a side-effect of condemning the past of the Russian Orthodox Church and her traditions, the innovations appeared to weaken the messianic theory depicting Moscow as the Third Rome. Instead of the guardian of Orthodox faith, Moscow seemed an accumulation of serious liturgical mistakes.

It is argued that changing the wording of the eighth article of the Nicaean Creed was one of the very few alterations that could be seen as a genuine correction, rather than aligning the texts of Russian liturgical books and practices, customs and even vestments with the Greek versions that Nikon considered were universally applicable norms. Nikon also attacked Russian Church rituals as erroneous, and even in some cases heretical, in comparison with their contemporary Greek equivalents. This went beyond the recommendation of Patriarch Paisios of Jerusalem, who suggested that differences in ritual did not of themselves indicate error, accepting the possibility that differences have developed over time. He urged Nikon to use discretion in attempting to enforce complete uniformity with Greek practice.

Nevertheless, both patriarch and tsar wished to carry out their reforms, although their endeavors may have had as much or more political motivation as religious; several authors on this subject point out that Tsar Aleksei, encouraged by his military success in the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667) to conquer West Russian provinces and Ukraine, developed ambitions of becoming the liberator of the Orthodox areas which at that time formed part of the Ottoman Empire. They also mention the role of the Near-East patriarchs, who actively supported the idea of the Russian Tsar becoming the liberator of all Orthodox Christians and who suggested that Patriarch Nikon might become the new Patriarch of Constantinople.

=== Main alterations ===
The numerous changes in both texts and rites occupied approximately 400 pages. Old Believers present the following as the most crucial changes:


Today&#x27;s readers might perceive these alterations as trivial, but the faithful of that time saw rituals and dogmas as strongly interconnected: church rituals had from the beginning represented and symbolized doctrinal truth. The authorities imposed the reforms in an autocratic fashion, with no consultation of the subject people. Those who reacted against the Nikonite reforms would have objected as much to the manner of imposition as to the alterations.

Changes were also often made arbitrarily in the texts. For example, wherever the books read &#x27;Христосъ&#x27; [&quot;Christ&quot;], Nikon&#x27;s assistants substituted &#x27;Сынъ&#x27; [meaning &quot;the Son&quot;], and wherever they read &#x27;Сынъ&#x27; they substituted &#x27;Христосъ&#x27;. Another example is that wherever the books read &#x27;Церковь&#x27; [meaning &quot;Church&quot;], Nikon substituted &#x27;Храмъ&#x27; [meaning &quot;Temple&quot;] and vice versa. 

According to a source sympathetic to the Old Believers:
== Schism ==

Opponents of the ecclesiastical reforms of Nikon emerged among all strata of the people and in relatively large numbers (see Raskol). However, after the deposition of Patriarch Nikon (1658), who presented too strong a challenge to the tsar&#x27;s authority, a series of church councils officially endorsed Nikon&#x27;s liturgical reforms.

The Old Believers fiercely rejected all innovations, and the most radical among them maintained that the official Church had fallen into the hands of the Antichrist. The Old Believers, under the leadership of Archpriest Avvakum Petrov (1620 or 1621 to 1682), publicly denounced and rejected all ecclesiastical reforms. The State church anathematized both the old rites and books and those who wished to stay loyal to them at the synod of 1666. From that moment, the Old Believers officially lacked all civil rights. The State had the most active Old Believers arrested, and executed several of them (including Archpriest Avvakum) some years later in 1682.

=== After the schism ===
After 1685, a period of persecutions began, including both torture and executions. Government oppression could vary from relatively moderate, as under Peter the Great (reigned 1682–1725) (Old Believers had to pay double taxation and a separate tax for wearing a beard)—to intense, as under Tsar Nicholas I (reigned 1825–1855). The Russian synodal state church and the state authorities often saw Old Believers as dangerous elements and as a threat to the Russian state.

There were Old Believers who chose death rather than give up their faith. Collective suicides by fire continued from the 17th century into the 19th century. The Old Believers considered such self-immolations not as a suicide but as a martyr’s death and an act of protest. In 1678, in the Paleostrov self-immolation, one of the largest, on an island in Lake Onega over 2,700 people perished at the sight of soldiers and officials who were sent to stop the burnings. In total, there were over 100 officially registered self-immolations of the Old Believers.

Old Believers were driven by persecutions to the fringes of Russia and became the dominant denomination in many regions, including the Pomors of the Russian Far North, in the Kursk region, in the Ural Mountains, in Siberia, and the Russian Far East. Many Old Believers fled Russia altogether, particularly for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where the community exists to this day. The 40,000-strong community of Lipovans still lives in Izmail Raion (Vylkove) of Ukraine and Tulcea County of Romania in the Danube Delta. In the Imperial Russian census of 1897, 2,204,596 people, about 1.75% of the population of the Russian Empire self-declared as Old Believers or other denominations split from the Russian Orthodox Church. By the 1910s, in the last Imperial Russian census just before the October Revolution, approximately ten percent of the population of the Russian Empire said that they belonged to one of the Old Believer branches (census data).

Some Old Believers evaded state persecution by fleeing to the Altai Mountains, a mountainous region near the Russian border with Mongolia. The convents of the Pomorskii group were built there at the beginning of the 20th century with the financial support of Savva Morozov, a rich textile mill owner and a member of the Pomorskii community himself. 

In 1762, Catherine the Great passed an act that allowed Old Believers to practise their faith openly without interference. In 1905, Tsar Nicholas II signed an act of religious freedom that ended the persecution of all religious minorities in Russia. The Old Believers gained the right to build churches, to ring church bells, to hold processions and to organize themselves. It became prohibited to refer to Old Believers as &quot;raskolniki&quot; (schismatics), as they were under Catherine the Great—reigned 1762–1796, a name they consider insulting.

People often refer to the period from 1905 until 1917 as &quot;the Golden Age of the Old Faith&quot;. One can regard the Act of 1905 as emancipating the Old Believers, who had until then occupied an almost illegal position in Russian society. Some restrictions for Old Believers continued: for example, they were forbidden from joining the civil service.

== Old Believer denominations ==
Although all Old Believers groups emerged as a result of opposition to the Nikonite reform, they do not constitute a single monolithic body. Despite the emphasis on invariable adherence to the pre-Nikonite traditions, the Old Believers feature a great diversity of groups that profess different interpretations of the church tradition and often are not in communion with each other. Some groups even practice re-baptism before admitting a member of another group into their midst.

Since none of the bishops joined the Old Believers, except Bishop Pavel of Kolomna, who was put to death for this, apostolically ordained priests of the old rite would have soon become extinct. Two responses appeared to this dilemma: the &quot;Popovtsy&quot; (поповцы, &quot;with priests&quot;) and the &quot;Bezpopovtsy&quot; (&quot;priestless&quot;).

=== Priested (Popovtsy) ===
The Popovtsy represented the more moderate conservative opposition, those who strove to continue religious and church life as it had existed before the reforms of Nikon. They recognized ordained priests from the new-style Russian Orthodox church who joined the Old Believers and who had denounced the Nikonite reforms. In 1846, they convinced Ambrose of Belaya Krinitsa (1791–1863), a Greek Orthodox bishop whom Turkish pressure had removed from his see at Sarajevo, to become an Old Believer and to consecrate three Russian Old Believer priests as bishops. In 1859, the number of Old Believer bishops in Russia reached ten and they established their own episcopate, the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy.

Not all popovtsy Old Believers recognized this hierarchy. Dissenters known as &quot;beglopopovtsy&quot; obtained their own hierarchy in the 1920s. The priestist Old Believers thus manifest as two churches which share the same beliefs, but which treat each other&#x27;s hierarchy as illegitimate. Popovtsy have priests, bishops and all sacraments, including the Eucharist.

* Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy—The largest popovtsy denomination. One can refer to the Russian part of this denomination as the Belokrinitskoe Soglasie (the &quot;Belokrinitsky Agreement&quot;) or as the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church. The Old Rite community founded at Rogozhskoye Cemetery played a major role in the creation of the denomination and remains as the seat of the &quot;Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia.&quot;
** Neokruzhniki (extinct)
* Novozybkovskaya hierarchy or Russian Old-Orthodox Church
* Nekrasov Cossacks, &quot;Nekrasovtsy&quot;
* Beglopopovtsy (extinct, now the Russian Old-Orthodox Church)
* Luzhkane, also known as &quot;Luzhkovskoe soglasie&quot;; in some places, they had no priests and so belonged to the Bezpopovtsy (extinct)
* There have also been Old Believer members, like Fr. Potapy Emelianov, of the Russian Catholic Church united with the Holy See, who would also be classed as &quot;popovtsy&quot;

=== Priestless (Bezpopovtsy) ===

The Bezpopovtsy rejected &quot;the World&quot; where they believed the Antichrist reigned; they preached the imminent end of Creation, asceticism, adherence to the old rituals and the old faith. More radical movements which already existed prior to the reforms of Nikon and where eschatological and anticlerical sentiments were predominant, would join the Bezpopovtsy Old Believers. The Bezpopovtsy claimed that any priest or ordinary who had ever used the Nikonite Rites had forfeited apostolic succession. Therefore, the true church of Christ had ceased to exist on Earth, and the Bezpopovtsy therefore renounced priests and all sacraments except baptism.

The Bezpopovtsy movement has many sub-groups. Bezpopovtsy have no priests and no Eucharist, but may elect a mentor () or church leaders ( or ) to lead the community and its services.

* Pomorian Old-Orthodox Church or Danilovtsy (not to be confused with Pomors) from North Russia (East Karelia, Arkhangelsk Oblast). Initially rejected marriage and prayer for the Tsar.
* Novopomortsy, or &quot;New Pomortsy&quot;: accept marriage.
* Staropomortsy, or &quot;Old Pomortsy&quot;: reject marriage.
* Fedoseevtsy: “Society of Christian Old Believers of the Old Pomortsy Unmarried Confession” (1690s until present); reject marriage and have cloister-style asceticism.
* Filippians: Named after their founder, Filipp. They were repressed by the Russian Government and so practised self-immolation for the “preservation of the faith”. 
* Chasovennye (from &quot;chasovnya,&quot; chapel): from Siberia. Initially had priests, but later shifted to priestless practise. Also known as Semeyskie east of Lake Baikal.

====Minor groups====
Apart from these major groups, many smaller groups have emerged and became extinct at various times since the end of the 17th century:

* &quot;Aristovtsy&quot; (beginning of the 19th to the beginning of the 20th centuries; extinct): from the name of the merchant Aristov.
* &quot;Titlovtsy&quot; (extinct in the 20th century): emerged from Fedoseevtsy; supported the use of the inscription &quot;INRI&quot; (&quot;titlo&quot;) upon the Orthodox cross, which other groups rejected.
* &quot;Troparion&quot; confession (&quot;troparschiki&quot;): commemorated the Tsar in the hymns (troparia).
* Daniel’s confession of the “partially married” (&quot;danilovtsy polubrachnye&quot;).
* Adamant confession (&quot;adamantovy&quot;): rejected money and passports as containing the seal of Antichrist.
* Aaron&#x27;s confession (&quot;aaronovtsy,&quot; second half of the 18th century): separated from the Fillipovtsy.
* “Grandmother&#x27;s confession” or the Self-baptized: practiced self-baptism or baptism by midwives (&quot;babushki&quot;), believing a valid priesthood had ceased to exist.
* “Hole-worshippers” (&quot;dyrniki&quot;): rejected the use of icons and prayed facing east through a hole in the wall.
* Melchisedecs (in Moscow and in Bashkortostan): practised a peculiar, lay “quasi-Eucharistic” liturgy.
* &quot;Runaways&quot; (&quot;beguny&quot;) or &quot;Wanderers&quot; (&quot;stranniki&quot;).
* “Saviour&#x27;s Confession” (&quot;Netovtsy&quot;): denied the possibility of celebrating sacraments and praying in churches; the name comes from the Russian &quot;net&quot; “no” as they have no sacraments, churches, priests, etc.

==Edinovertsy==

Edinovertsy (, i.e. &quot;people of the same faith&quot;; collective, единоверчество; often referred to as Orthodox Old Ritualists, православные старообрядцы): Agreed to become a part of the official Russian Orthodox Church while saving the old rites. First appearing in 1800, the Edinovertsy come under the omophorion of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate – Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, abbreviated as ROCOR – have come into communion under different circumstances and retain being old believers in the traditional context and retain the use of the pre-Nikonite rituals. Alexander Dugin, sociologist and a former strategic adviser to Vladimir Putin, is a proponent of edinoverie, since it combines Apostolic succession of the ROC, while preserving pre-Nikonite liturgical tradition.

== Validity of the reformist theory ==
Vladimir officially converted the Eastern Slavs to Christianity in 988, and the people had adopted Greek Orthodox liturgical practices. At the end of the 11th century, the efforts of St. Theodosius of the Caves in Kiev (&quot;Феодосий Киево-Печерский&quot;, d. 1074) introduced the so-called &quot;Studite Typicon&quot; to Russia. This &quot;typicon&quot; (essentially, a guide-book for liturgical and monastic life) reflected the traditions of the urban Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople. The &quot;Studite typicon&quot; predominated throughout the western part of the Byzantine Empire and was accepted throughout the Russian lands.

At the end of the 14th century, through the work of Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus&#x27;, the Studite liturgical practices were gradually replaced in Russia with the so-called &quot;Jerusalem Typicon&quot; or the &quot;Typicon of St. Sabbas&quot;—originally, an adaptation of the Studite liturgy to the customs of Palestinian monasteries. The process of gradual change of &quot;typica&quot; continued throughout the 15th century and, because of its slow implementation, met with little resistance—unlike Nikon&#x27;s reforms, conducted with abruptness and violence.

In the course of the 15th—17th centuries, Russian scribes continued to insert some Studite material into the general shape of &quot;Jerusalem Typicon&quot;. This explains the differences between the modern version of the &quot;Typicon&quot;, used by the Russian Orthodox Church, and the pre-Nikonite Russian recension of &quot;Jerusalem Typicon&quot;, called &quot;Oko Tserkovnoe&quot; (Rus. &quot;eye of the church&quot;). This pre-Nikonite version, based on the Moscow printed editions of 1610, 1633 and 1641, continues to be used by modern Old Believers.

In the course of the polemics against Old Believers, the official Russian Orthodox Church often claimed the discrepancies, which emerged in the texts between the Russian and the Greek churches, as Russian innovations, errors, or arbitrary translations. This charge of &quot;Russian innovation&quot; re-appeared repeatedly in the textbooks and anti-&quot;raskol&quot; treatises and catecheses, including, for example, those by Dimitry of Rostov.

The critical evaluation of the sources and of the essence of the church reforms began only in the 1850s, with the groundbreaking work of several church historians, Byzantinists, and theologians, including S. A. Belokurov, A. P. Shchapov, A. K. Borozdin, N. Gibbenet and, later, E. E. Golubinsky, A. V. Kartashev, A. A. Dmitriyevsky, and Nikolai F. Kapterev. The last four were members of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. Research was continued later mainly by Serge A. Zenkovsky, a specialist on Russian ecclesiastical culture. Golubinsky, Dmitriyevsky, Kartashov and Kapterev, amongst others, demonstrated that the rites, rejected and condemned by the church reforms, were genuine traditions of Orthodox Christianity, altered in Greek usage during the 15th–16th centuries but remaining unchanged in Russia. The pre-Nikonite liturgical practices, including some elements of the Russian typicon &quot;Oko Tserkovnoe&quot;, were demonstrated to have preserved earlier Byzantine practices, being closer to the earlier Byzantine texts than some later Greek customs.

Remarkably, the scholars who opened the new avenues for re-evaluation of the reform by the Russian Church themselves held membership in the official church (A. V. Kapterev, for instance, was a professor at the Slavic Greek Latin Academy) but nevertheless took up serious study of the causes and background of the reforms and of the resulting schism. Their research revealed that the official explanation regarding the old Russian books and rites was unsustainable.

== Background ==

As Serge A. Zenkovsky points out in his standard work &quot;Russia&#x27;s Old Believers&quot;, the Old Believer schism did not occur simply as a result of a few individuals with power and influence. The schism had complex causes, revealing historical processes and circumstances in 17th-century Russian society. Those who broke from the hierarchy of the official State Church had quite divergent views on church, faith, society, state power and social issues. Thus the collective term &quot;Old Believers&quot; groups together various movements within Russian society which actually had existed long before 1666–67. They shared a distrust of state power and of the episcopate, insisting upon the right of the people to arrange their own spiritual life, and expressing the ambition to aim for such control.

Both the popovtsy and bespopovtsy, although theologically and psychologically two different teachings, manifested spiritual, eschatological and mystical tendencies throughout Russian religious thought and church life. One can also emphasize the schism&#x27;s position in the political and cultural background of its time: increasing Western influence, secularization, and attempts to subordinate the Church to the state. Nevertheless, the Old Believers sought above all to defend and preserve the purity of the Orthodox faith, embodied in the old rituals, which inspired many to strive against Patriarch Nikon&#x27;s church reforms even unto death.

In the past the Old Believers&#x27; movement was often perceived as an obscure faith in rituals that led to the deaths of tens of thousands of ignorant people. Old Believers were accused of not being able to distinguish the important from the unimportant. To many people of that time, however, rituals expressed the very essence of their faith. Old Believers hold that the preservation of a certain &quot;microclimate&quot; that enables the salvation of one&#x27;s soul requires not only living by the commandments of Christ, but also carefully preserving Church tradition, which contains the spiritual power and knowledge of past centuries, embodied in external forms.

The Old Believers reject the idea of contents &quot;a priori&quot; prevailing over form. To illustrate this issue, the renowned Russian historian Vasily Klyuchevsky (1841–1911) referred to poetry. He argued, that if one converts a poem into prose, the contents of the poem may remain intact, but the poem will lose its charm and emotional impact; moreover, the poem will essentially no longer exist. In the case of religious rituals, form and contents do not just form two separable, autonomous entities, but connect with each other through complex relationships, including theological, psychological, phenomenal, aesthetic and historic dimensions.

These aspects, play a role in the perception of these rituals by the faithful and in their spiritual lives. Considering the fact that Church rituals from their very beginning were intertwined with doctrinal truth, changing these rituals may have a tremendous effect on religious conscience and a severe impact on the faithful.

Centuries of persecution and the nature of their origin have made some Old Believers culturally conservative. Some Old Believers consider any pre-Nikonite Orthodox Russian practice or artifact as exclusively theirs, denying that the Russian Orthodox Church has any claims upon a history before Patriarch Nikon.

However, Russian economic history of the late 19th and early 20th centuries reveals the Old-Believer merchant families as more flexible and more open to innovations while creating factories and starting the first Russian industries.

== Main differences ==
* Old Believers use two fingers while making the Sign of the Cross (the pointer finger straight, middle finger slightly bent) while new-style Orthodoxy uses two fingers and the thumb for the sign of cross (the thumb and two fingers are held together at point, two fingers folded). Old Ritualists generally say the Jesus Prayer with the Sign of the Cross, while New Ritualists use the Sign of the Cross as a Trinitarian symbol. This makes for a significant difference between the two branches of Russian Orthodoxy, and one of the most noticeable (see the picture of Boyarynya Feodosia Morozova above). A prayer rug known as the Podruchnik is used to keep one&#x27;s face and hands clean during prostrations, as these parts of the body are used to make the sign of the cross on oneself.
* Old Believers reject any changes and emendations of liturgical texts and rituals introduced by the reforms of Patriarch Nikon. Thus they continue to use the previous Church Slavonic translation of the Greek texts, including the Psalter, striving to preserve intact the &quot;pre-Nikonite&quot; practices of the Russian Church.
* Old Believers only recognize performing baptism through three full immersions, in agreement with the Greek practice, but reject the validity of any baptismal rite performed otherwise (for example through pouring or sprinkling, as the Russian Orthodox Church has occasionally accepted since the 18th century). (See Oblivantsy)
* Old Believers perform the Liturgy with seven prosphora, instead of five as in new-rite Russian Orthodoxy or a single large prosphoron, as sometimes done by the Greeks and Arabs.
* Old Believers chant the alleluia verse after the psalmody twice rather than the three times mandated by the Nikonite reforms.
* Old Believers do not use polyphonic singing as the new-style Russian practice, but only the monodic, unison singing of Znamenny chant. In this respect it represents a tradition that parallels the use of Byzantine chant and neumatic notation.

== Soviet period ==
The first Soviet government, appointed on 26 October 1917, included several prominent figures with the Old Believers background: Aleksei Rykov, the first Commissar on Internal Affairs, Vladimir Milyutin, Commissar for Agriculture, Alexander Shliapnikov, Commissar for Labor, and Viktor Nogin, Commissar for Trade and Industry. The Cabinet secretary was Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich, a top Russian expert on the Old Believers and variuous sects. Bolsheviks regarded the Old Believers and sectarians as a kind of social protest, the opposition against the Tsarist regime. 

Nevertheless, the October Revolution in 1917 and the Russian Civil War encouraged many Old Believers to flee military conscription and starvation. Many of them traveled to China and settled in Manchuria, others settled in Xinjiang. However, when the Communists came to power in China in 1948-49, both these groups of Old Believers were forced to emigrate again. Most families moved to Brazil and Argentina, some moved to the USA and Australia.

Religion in the Soviet Union was never officially outlawed, but religious property was confiscated, believers were harassed, and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools. Persecution of religion intensified in the Stalin era. Between 1937 and 1940 the remnants of a few noteworthy Ural Old Believer monasteries secretly relocated to the remote lower Yenisei River area in Siberia, including the area of the Dubches River and its tributaries in Turukhansky District. However, in 1951 the Dubches secret Old Believer monasteries were spotted from the air by Soviet authorities and subsequently demolished. The Old Believers living there were arrested and all the buildings, icons, and books were burned. Thirty-three persons were convicted under Article 58-10, Part 2 and Article 58-11 of the Soviet Criminal Code and sentenced to terms of imprisonment in Gulag camps ranging from ten to twenty-five years. Two of them perished in imprisonment. After Stalin&#x27;s death, the others were granted amnesty in 1954.

== Present situation ==
===In Russia===
In 1971, the Moscow Patriarchate revoked the anathemas imposed on the Old Believers in the 17th century. In 1974, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia issued an &quot;ukase&quot; revoking the anathemas, asking forgiveness from the Old Believers. Under their auspices, the first efforts to make the prayer and service books of the Old Believers available in English were made. Nevertheless, most Old Believer communities have not returned to full communion with the majority of Orthodox Christianity worldwide.

Old Believer churches in Russia have started restoration of their property, although Old Believers face many difficulties in claiming their restitution rights for their churches. Moscow has churches for all the most important Old Believer branches: Rogozhskaya Zastava (Popovtsy of the Belokrinitskaya hierarchy official center), a cathedral for the Novozybkovskaya hierarchy in Zamoskvorech&#x27;ye and Preobrazhenskaya Zastava where Pomortsy and Fedoseevtsy coexist.

Small hidden communities have been found in the Russian Far North (specifically remote areas of Arkhangelsk Oblast and the Komi Republic) and various regions of Siberia, especially concentrated in the areas between the Altai Mountains and Tuva Republic. Perhaps the highest concentration of older established Old Believer communities, with foundations dating back hundreds of years, can be found concentrated in Eastern Siberia, specifically the Transbaikal region in desolate areas of Buryatia and Zabaykalsky Krai. Others, like the Lykov family, fled later into the wild to avoid Communist persecution.

===Outside Russia===

Modern-day Old Believers live all over the world, having fled Russia under tsarist persecution and after the Russian Revolution of 1917. Some Old Believers are still transient throughout various parts of the world today. Significant established Old Believer communities exist in the United States and Canada in Plamondon, Alberta; Hines Creek, Alberta; Woodburn, Oregon; Erie, Pennsylvania; Erskine, Minnesota; and in various parts of Alaska including near Homer in the Fox River area villages of Voznesenka, Razdolna, and Kachemak Selo, Nikolaevsk, Beryozova, Delta Junction, and Kodiak, Alaska (Larsen Bay area, and on Raspberry Island).

Two communities exist in Sydney, Australia, and in the South Island of New Zealand. A large community existed in Yarwun, Australia, for many years until many families left the area in the early 2000s. Communities also have been established in many parts of South America, including Brazil (Primavera do Leste), Bolivia, Argentina (Choele Choel) and Uruguay (Colonia Ofir), where they moved after having found refuge in China between the 1920s and the 1950s.

Old Believer communities are also found in Georgia and Kazakhstan.

The Lipovans, who live in Romania&#x27;s Danube Delta, are descendants of the Old Believers who left Russia in around 1740 to avoid religious persecutions.

There are approximately 3,000 Old Believers in Bolivia as of 2006. Old Believers arrived in Alaska, US, in the second half of the 20th century, helping to revive a shrinking Orthodox population.

Old Believers from Russia fled to Swedish Estonia and Livonia in the end of the 17th century. Currently, there are 2,605 Old Believers in Estonia according to the 2011 census. They live mostly in villages from Mustvee to Omedu and from Nina to Varnja on the western coast of Lake Peipus, and on Piirissaar Island. Their proximity to Lake Peipus gives them their name &quot;peipsivenelased&quot; (&quot;Peipus Russians&quot;) in Estonian.

Two Old Believer missions have been established in Pakistan and Uganda.

<text>Otto Jonas Lindblad (31 March 1809 – 26 January 1864), was a Swedish composer. He is most famous for the musical score of &quot;Kungssången&quot;, the Swedish royal anthem.

Otto Lindblad was the son of a clergyman. He was born in Karlstorp and attended gymnasium in Växjö. In 1829 he began academic studies at the University of Lund. In Lund, he formed a group with A. E. Christernin and J. Meurling, together with whom he played and sang a type of three part music pieces. The group became known as the &quot;musical trefoil band&quot;. In 1836 he ended his studies and fully devoted his time to music. Two years later he formed the Lund Student Singers Association. On 5 December 1844 he presented the Royal Anthem for the first time, at a celebration for King Oscar I.

In 1846 Lindblad undertook a national tour with the noted Lund Quartet. The tour&#x27;s revenue was to have been used for student housing in Lund, but the profit was too small and they only managed to bring home 1500 Riksdaler. In the spring of 1847 he took up the position of parish clerk and organist in Mellby. He married Emma Andersson in 1855. Their only child, a daughter, died as an infant. Otto Lindblad died in North Mellby parish at the age of 55 years, following a long period of illness.

<doc id="228708" wikidata="Q6722016" url="?curid=228708" title="Occupation of Iraq (2003–2011)">
<text>The occupation of Iraq (2003–2011) began on 20 March 2003, when the United States invaded with a military coalition to overthrow Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and his Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party, and continued until 18 December 2011, when the final batch of American troops left the country. While the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia were the largest contributors to the coalition, 29 other countries, such as Japan, were involved in the Iraq War in a lesser capacity. Additionally, several private military contractors took part in enforcing the occupation.

It was a period of violence and political turmoil, and saw strong foreign influence exerted on Iraqi politics. In April 2003, the fall of Saddam&#x27;s government was formally marked by the establishment of the Coalition Provisional Authority, which later appointed and granted limited powers to the Iraq Interim Governing Council. In June 2004, the Iraqi Interim Government was established, ending the international armed conflict that had existed between Iraq (that is, Ba&#x27;athist Iraq) and the United States. Following the January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election, this administration was replaced by the Iraqi Transitional Government. A year later, the Al Maliki I Government took office.

Efforts to rebuild post-Saddam Iraq were slowed when the American-led military coalition and the new Iraqi government became locked in a grueling conflict with a stronger-than-expected militant Iraqi insurgency, leading to difficult living conditions for the country&#x27;s population throughout the period.

==Military government==
A military occupation was established and run by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), which later appointed and granted limited powers to an Iraq Interim Governing Council. Troops for the invasion came primarily from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, but 29 other nations also provided some troops, and there were varying levels of assistance from Japan and other allied countries. Tens of thousands of private security personnel provided protection of infrastructure, facilities and personnel.

Coalition and allied Iraqi forces fought a stronger-than-expected militant Iraqi insurgency, and so the reconstruction of Iraq was slow. In mid-2004, the direct rule of the CPA was ended and a new &quot;sovereign and independent&quot; Interim Government of Iraq assumed the full responsibility and authority of the state. The CPA and the Governing Council were disbanded on 28 June 2004, and a new transitional constitution came into effect.

Sovereignty was transferred to a Governing Council Iraqi interim government led by Iyad Allawi as Iraq&#x27;s first post-Saddam prime minister; this government was not allowed to make new laws without the approval of the CPA. The Iraqi Interim Government was replaced as a result of the elections which took place in January 2005. A period of negotiations by the elected Iraqi National Assembly followed, which culminated on 6 April 2005 with the selection of, among others, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari and President Jalal Talabani. Prime Minister al-Jaafari led the majority party of the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA), a coalition of the al-Dawa and SCIRI (Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq) parties. Both parties are backed by Tehran, and were banned by Saddam Hussein.

=== Legal status of the coalition&#x27;s presence ===
An international armed conflict (IAC) between the United States and Iraq in the Iraq War began when the US-led Coalition invaded Iraq on 19 March 2003. IAC continued after the invasion when the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was established on 21 April to temporarily administer the domestic affairs of Iraq. Therefore, hostilities during the invasion and occupation of Iraq fell under the laws of war applicable to IAC, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, to which the US and Iraq are parties to, and the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV - The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot;, which is commonly accepted as customary international humanitarian law binding on non-signatories engaged in an IAC. According to Article 42 under Section III of the Hague Convention &quot;IV - The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot;, &quot;[t]erritory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army.&quot;

There may be situations where the former occupier will maintain a military presence in the country, with the agreement of the legitimate government under a security arrangement (e.g., US military presence in Japan and Germany). The legality of such agreement and the legitimacy of the national authorities signing it are subject to international recognition, whereby members of the international community re-establish diplomatic and political relations with the national government.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 in 2004 looked forward to the end of the occupation and the assumption of full responsibility and authority by a fully sovereign and independent Interim Government of Iraq. Afterwards, the UN and individual nations established diplomatic relations with the Interim Government, which began planning for elections and the writing of a new constitution. As a result, the Iraq War after 28 June 2004 became a non-international armed conflict (NIAC), since US-led Coalition troops were operating in the country with the consent of the new legitimate government of Iraq. Therefore, hostilities in post-occupation Iraq fell under the laws of war applicable to NIAC, including Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.

In January 2005, John Negroponte, US ambassador to Iraq, indicated the US government would comply with a United Nations resolution declaring that coalition forces would have to leave if requested by the Iraqi government. &quot;If that&#x27;s the wish of the government of Iraq, we will comply with those wishes. But no, we haven&#x27;t been approached on this issue – although obviously we stand prepared to engage the future government on any issue concerning our presence here.&quot;

On 10 May 2007, 144 Iraqi Parliamentary lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition calling on the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal. On 3 June 2007, the Iraqi Parliament voted 85 to 59 to require the Iraqi government to consult with Parliament before requesting additional extensions of the UN Security Council Mandate for Coalition operations in Iraq. The UN mandate under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1790 expired on 31 December 2008.

==Occupation (21 April 2003 – 28 June 2004)==
An international armed conflict (IAC) between the US and Iraq in the Iraq War began when the US-led Coalition invaded Iraq on 19 March 2003. IAC continued after the invasion when the CPA was established on 21 April to temporarily administer the domestic affairs of Iraq. Therefore, hostilities during the invasion and occupation of Iraq fell under the laws of war applicable to IAC, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, to which the US and Iraq are parties to, and the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV - The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot;, which is commonly accepted as customary international humanitarian law binding on non-signatories engaged in an IAC.

===2003===
====Fall of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government====
Schools, police, courts, government, and military were shut down, which meant that most Iraqis were unemployed. Cities, especially Baghdad, suffered through reductions in electricity, clean water, and telephone service from pre-war levels, with shortages that continued through at least the next year.

On 1 May 2003, President of the United States George W. Bush declared the &quot;end of major combat operations&quot; in Iraq, while aboard the with a large &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; banner displayed behind him. The weeks following the removal of Ba&#x27;ath Party rule were portrayed by American media as generally a euphoric time among the Iraqi populace. &quot;New York Post&quot; correspondent Jonathan Foreman wrote from Baghdad in May 2003 that &quot;the intensity of the population&#x27;s pro-American enthusiasm is astonishing&quot;.

There were widespread reports of looting, though much of the looting was directed at former government buildings and other remnants of the former government, and reports of losses of up to 170,000 items of Iraq&#x27;s archaeological treasures worth billions of US dollars, mostly from the National Museum of Iraq, were later revealed to be vastly exaggerated.

====Beginning of the Iraqi insurgency====
In the summer of 2003, the US military focused on hunting down the remaining leaders of the ousted government, culminating in the killing of Saddam&#x27;s sons Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein on 22 July. In all, over 200 top leaders of the former regime were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.

After the initial invasion, most of the Iraqi military&#x27;s former soldiers and officers offered little resistance to Coalition forces in the early days of the occupation. Many soldiers had simply gone home rather than openly fight the invading forces. This seeming acceptance of Coalition authority stemmed from the US military continuing to pay the salaries of Saddam&#x27;s former soldiers, while promising senior Iraqi officers that they would have a major role to play &quot;in building a new Iraq.&quot;

However, on 11 May 2003, the Bush Administration established the &quot;Coalition Provisional Authority&quot; (CPA) to take control of Iraq&#x27;s domestic affairs away from the US military. Twelve days later, Paul Bremer, head of the CPA, issued an order dissolving the entire Iraqi military, as well as most civilian employees of the old government, and pledged to build a new military and government from scratch. One &quot;untainted by any ties to Saddam&#x27;s regime,&quot; according to the CPA. The Iraqi army&#x27;s abrupt end, against the protests of many US field commanders, sparked immediate rioting among former Iraqi soldiers. In addition to broader civil unrest as unemployment skyrocketed to 70% and practically every government service, from the police to trash collectors, ended without warning. Soon, large numbers of former Iraqi military personnel allied with the surviving Ba&#x27;ath loyalists and formed guerrilla units, igniting an eight-year insurgency against Coalition forces. Besides scattered attacks in Baghdad, these insurgents began to focus on taking and holding ground in and around Mosul, Tikrit, and Fallujah. In the fall of 2003, these largely secular units were joined by religiously motivated &quot;Jihadists&quot; insurgents, both foreign and domestic. With the growing influence of religious fanatics, the insurgency&#x27;s mostly traditional tactics of sniping, small unit ambushes and planting roadside improvised explosive devices against foreign military personnel began transforming into frequent suicide bombings and death squads targeting civilians that were perceived as &quot;loyal&quot; to coalition forces.

They favored attacking the unarmored Humvee vehicles, and in November they successfully attacked US rotary aircraft with SA-7 missiles bought on the global black market. On 19 August, the UN Headquarters in Baghdad was destroyed in the Canal Hotel Bombing, killing at least 22 people, among them Sérgio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the UN Secretary General.

====Saddam captured and elections urged====

In December 2003, Saddam himself was captured. The provisional government began training a security force intended to defend critical infrastructure, and the US promised over $20 billion in reconstruction aid in the form of credits against Iraq&#x27;s future oil revenues. At the same time, elements left out of the Iraqi Patriotic Alliance (IPA) began to agitate for elections. Most prominent among these was Ali al-Sistani, Grand Ayatollah in the Shia sect of Islam.

The United States and the Coalition Provisional Authority, run by Jay Garner and three deputies, including Tim Cross, opposed allowing democratic elections at this time, preferring instead to eventually hand over power to an unelected group of Iraqis. More insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around Fallujah and the poor Shia sections of cities from Baghdad to Basra in the south.

===1 January 2004 – 28 June 2004===


====Spring fighting====

In the spring, the United States and the Coalition Provisional Authority decided to confront the rebels with a pair of assaults: one on Fallujah, the center of the &quot;Mohammed&#x27;s Army of Al-Ansar&quot;, and another on Najaf, home of an important mosque, which had become the focal point for the Mahdi Army and its activities. In Fallujah four private security contractors, working for Blackwater USA, were ambushed and killed, and their corpses desecrated. In retaliation a US offensive was begun, but it was soon halted because of the protests by the Iraqi Governing Council and negative media coverage.

A truce was negotiated that put a former Ba&#x27;athist general in complete charge of Fallujah. The 1st Armored Division along with the 2nd ACR were then shifted south, because Spanish, Salvadoran, Ukrainian, and Polish forces were having increasing difficulties retaining control over Al Kut, and Najaf. The 1st Armored Division and 2nd ACR relieved the Spaniards, Salvadoran, Poles, and put down the overt rebellion.

At the same time, British forces in Basra were faced with increasing restiveness, and became more selective in the areas they patrolled. In all, April, May and early June represented the bloodiest months of fighting since the end of hostilities. The Iraqi troops who were left in charge of Fallujah after the truce began to disperse and the city fell back under insurgent control.

In the April battle for Fallujah, US troops killed about 200 resistance fighters, while 40 Americans died and hundreds were wounded in a fierce battle. US forces then turned their attention to the al Mahdi Army in Najaf. A large convoy of US Army supply trucks manned by civilian contractors was ambushed and suffered significant damage and casualties.

====Transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis====
On 28 June 2004, under the auspices of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546, the CPA transferred limited sovereignty to a caretaker government, whose first act was to begin the trial of Saddam Hussein. The transfer marked the end of an IAC between the U.S. and Iraq. The new Iraqi government began the process of moving towards elections, though the insurgency, and the lack of cohesion within the government itself, led to repeated delays.

Militia leader Muqtada al-Sadr used his grass-roots organization and Mahdi Militia of over a thousand armed men to take control of the streets of Baghdad. The CPA soon realized it had lost control and closed down his popular newspaper. This resulted in mass anti-American demonstrations. The CPA then attempted to arrest al-Sadr on murder charges. He defied the American military by taking refuge in the Holy City of Najaf.

==Post-occupation (28 June 2004 – 15 December 2011)==

Hostilities between the US and Iraq ended on 28 June 2004 when the CPA handed over Iraqi sovereignty to the Iraqi Interim government as mandated by UN Resolution 1546. Throughout the Iraq War, US-led Coalition troops were operating in the country with the consent of the new legitimate government of Iraq. Therefore, the war in Iraq after 28 June 2004 became a non-international armed conflict (NIAC), which fell under the laws of war applicable to NIAC, including Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.

===28 June 2004 – 31 December 2004===
Through July and August, a series of skirmishes in and around Najaf culminated with the Imman Ali Mosque itself under siege, only to have a peace deal brokered by al-Sistani in late August. Al-Sadr then declared a national cease fire, and opened negotiations with the American and government forces. His militia was incorporated into the Iraqi security forces and al-Sadr is now a special envoy. This incident was the turning point in the failed American efforts to install Ahmed Chalabi as leader of the interim government. The CPA then put Iyad Allawi in power; ultimately he was only marginally more popular than Chalabi.

The Allawi government, with significant numbers of holdovers from the Coalition Provisional Authority, began to engage in attempts to secure control of the oil infrastructure, the source of Iraq&#x27;s foreign currency, and control of the major cities of Iraq. The continuing insurgencies, poor state of the Iraqi Army, disorganized condition of police and security forces, as well as the lack of revenue hampered their efforts to assert control. In addition, both former Ba&#x27;athist elements and militant Shia groups engaged in sabotage, terrorism, open rebellion, and establishing their own security zones in all or part of a dozen cities. The Allawi government vowed to crush resistance, using US troops, but at the same time negotiated with Muqtada al-Sadr.

====Offensives and counteroffensives====
Beginning 8 November, American and Iraqi forces invaded the militant stronghold of Fallujah in Operation Phantom Fury, killing and capturing many insurgents. Many rebels were thought to have fled the city before the invasion. US-backed figures put insurgency losses at over 2,000. It was the bloodiest single battle for the US in the war, with 92 Americans dead and several hundred wounded. A video showing the killing of at least one unarmed and wounded man by an American serviceman surfaced, throwing renewed doubt and outrage at the efficiency of the US occupation. The Marine was later cleared of any wrongdoing because the Marines had been warned that the enemy would sometimes feign death and booby-trap bodies as a tactic to lure Marines to their deaths. November was the deadliest month of the occupation for coalition troops, surpassing April.

Another offensive was launched by insurgents during the month of November in Mosul. US forces backed by peshmerga fighters launched a counteroffensive which resulted in the Battle of Mosul (2004). The fighting in Mosul occurred concurrently with the fighting in Fallujah and attributed to the high number of American casualties taken that month.

In December, 14 American soldiers were killed and over a hundred injured when an explosion struck an open-tent mess hall in Mosul, where President Bush had spent Thanksgiving with troops the year before. The explosion is believed to have come from a suicide bomber.

After a review of the military strategy in the end of 2004, then commanding general of the MNF-I, General George Casey directed the Coalition forces to shift their focus from fighting insurgents to training Iraqis. At the time, the Iraqi insurgency was mainly directed against the occupation and it was believed that if the Coalition would reduce its presence then the insurgency would diminish. Military planners hoped that national elections would change the perception of being under occupation, stabilize the situation and allow the Coalition to reduce its presence.

===2005===
====Iraqi elections and aftermath====
On 30 January, an election for a government to draft a permanent constitution took place. Although some violence and lack of widespread Sunni Arab participation marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On 4 February, Paul Wolfowitz announced that 15,000 US troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month. February, March and April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the average 70.

Hopes for a quick end to an insurgency and a withdrawal of US troops were dashed at the advent of May, Iraq&#x27;s bloodiest month since the invasion of US forces in March and April 2003. Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations mainly of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 US soldiers.
During early and mid-May, the US also launched Operation Matador, an assault by around 1,000 Marines in the ungoverned region of western Iraq. Its goal was the closing of suspected insurgent supply routes of volunteers and material from Syria, and with the fight they received their assumption proved correct. Fighters armed with flak jackets (unseen in the insurgency by this time) and sporting sophisticated tactics met the Marines, eventually inflicting 30 US casualties by the operation&#x27;s end, and suffering 125 casualties themselves.

The Marines succeeded, recapturing the whole region and even fighting insurgents all the way to the Syrian border, where they were forced to stop (Syrian residents living near the border heard the American bombs very clearly during the operation). The vast majority of these armed and trained insurgents quickly dispersed before the US could bring the full force of its firepower on them, as it did in Fallujah.

====Announcements and renewed fighting====
On 14 August 2005 the &quot;Washington Post&quot; quoted one anonymous US senior official expressing that &quot;the United States no longer expects to see a model new democracy, a self-supporting oil industry or a society in which the majority of people are free from serious security or economic challenges... &#x27;What we expected to achieve was never realistic given the timetable or what unfolded on the ground.

On 22 September 2005, Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said he had warned the Bush administration that Iraq was hurtling toward disintegration, and that the election planned for December was unlikely to make any difference. US officials immediately made statements rejecting this view.

====Constitutional ratification and elections====
The National Assembly elected in January had drafted a new constitution to be ratified in a national referendum on 15 October 2005. For ratification, the constitution required a majority of national vote, and could be blocked by a two-thirds &quot;no&quot; vote in each of at least three of the 18 governorates. In the actual vote, 79% of the voters voted in favor, and there was a two-thirds &quot;no&quot; vote in only two governorates, both predominantly Sunni. The new Constitution of Iraq was ratified and took effect. Sunni turnout was substantially heavier than for the January elections, but insufficient to block ratification.

Elections for a new Iraqi National Assembly were held under the new constitution on 15 December 2005. This election used a proportional system, with approximately 25% of the seats required to be filled by women. After the election, a coalition government was formed under the leadership of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, with Jalal Talabani as president.

===2006===

The beginning of that year was marked by government creation talks and continuous anti-coalition and attacks on mainly Shia civilians.

====Al-Askari shrine bombing and Sunni-Shia fighting====
:See &quot;Al Askari Mosque bombing and Iraqi civil war (2006–2008)&quot;
On 22 February 2006. bombs exploded at the Al Askari Mosque causing substantial damage.

On 2 March the director of the Baghdad morgue fled Iraq explaining,
&quot;7,000 people have been killed by death squads in recent months.&quot; The Boston Globe reported that around eight times the number of Iraqis killed by terrorist bombings during March 2006 were killed by sectarian death squads during the same period. A total of 1,313 were killed by sectarian militias while 173 were killed by suicide bombings. The LA Times later reported that about 3,800 Iraqis were killed by sectarian violence in Baghdad alone during the first three months of 2006. During April 2006, morgue numbers show that 1,091 Baghdad residents were killed by sectarian executions.

Insurgencies, frequent terrorist attacks and sectarian violence in Iraq lead to harsh criticism of US policy and fears of a failing state and civil war. The concerns were expressed by several US think tanks as well as the US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad.

In early 2006, a handful of high-ranking retired generals began to demand Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld&#x27;s resignation due in part to the aforementioned chaos that apparently resulted from his management of the war.

===British hand Muthanna province to Iraqis===
On 12 July 2006, Iraq took full control of the Muthanna province, marking the first time since the invasion that a province had been handed from foreign troops to the Iraqi government. In a joint statement, the US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and the US commander in Iraq, General George Casey, hailed it as a milestone in Iraq&#x27;s capability to govern and protect itself as a &quot;sovereign nation&quot; and said handovers in other provinces will take place as conditions are achieved. &quot;With this first transition of security responsibility, Muthanna demonstrates the progress Iraq is making toward self- governance&quot;, the statement said, adding that &quot;Multi-National Forces will stand ready to provide assistance if needed.&quot; At the ceremony marking the event, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated, &quot;It is a great national day that will be registered in the history of Iraq. This step forward will bring happiness to all Iraqis.&quot;

===Forward Operating Base Courage handed over to Nineveh province government===

A former presidential compound of Saddam Hussein, dubbed Forward Operating Base Courage by Coalition forces, was handed over by Charlie Company 4-11FA to the Nineveh province government on 20 July 2006. The main palace had been home to the 101st Airborne Division Main Command Post, Task Force Olympia CP, 4-11FA of the 172nd SBCT, and the Task Force Freedom CP. The palace served as the last command post for the Multinational Force-Iraq–Northwest. US soldiers had spent the summer restoring the palace for the eventual handover.

Major General Thomas R. Turner II, commanding general, Task Force Band of Brothers stated at a ceremony marking the occasion &quot;The turnover of Forward Operating Base Courage is one of the larger efforts towards empowering the Iraqi people and represents an important step in achieving Iraqi self-reliance ... The gains made during the past three years demonstrate that the provincial government, the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi Police are increasing their capabilities to take the lead for their nation&#x27;s security.&quot; Duraid Kashmoula, the governor of the Nineveh Governorate, stated after being handed the key to the palace &quot;Now this palace will be used to benefit the Iraqi government and its people.&quot;

===British troops leave Camp Abu Naji===

On 24 August 2006, Maj Charlie Burbridge, a British military spokesman, said the last of 1,200 British troops left Camp Abu Naji, just outside Amarah in Iraq&#x27;s southern Maysan province. Burbridge told Reuters that British troops leaving the base were preparing to head deep into the marshlands along the Iranian border, stating &quot;We are repositioning our forces to focus on border areas and deal with reports of smuggling of weapons and improvised explosive devices from across the border.&quot;

The base had been a target for frequent mortar and rocket barrages since being set up in 2003, but Burbridge dismissed suggestions the British had been forced out of Amara while acknowledging the attacks had been one reason for the decision to withdraw, the second being that a static base did not fit with the new operation. &quot;Abu Naji was a bulls-eye in the middle of a dartboard. The attacks were a nuisance and were a contributing factor in our planning&quot;, to quit the base, he said, adding &quot;By no longer presenting a static target, we reduce the ability of the militias to strike us ... We understand the militias in Maysan province are using this as an example that we have been pushed out of Abu Naji, but that is not true. It was very rare for us to take casualties.&quot; Burbridge stated that Iraqi security forces would now be responsible for day-to-day security in Maysan but stressed that the British had not yet handed over complete control to them.

Muqtada al-Sadr called the departure the first expulsion of US-led coalition forces from an Iraqi urban center. A message from al-Sadr&#x27;s office that played on car-mounted speakers throughout Amarah exclaimed &quot;This is the first Iraqi city that has kicked out the occupier ... We have to celebrate this occasion!&quot; A crowd of as many as 5,000 people, including hundreds armed with AK-47 assault rifles, ransacked Camp Abu Naji immediately after the last British soldier had departed despite the presence of a 450-member Iraqi army brigade meant to guard the base. The looting, which lasted from about 10 am to early evening, turned violent at about noon when individuals in the mob shot at the base.

The Iraqi troops asked the province&#x27;s governor for permission to return fire, a decision the British military highlighted as evidence of the security force&#x27;s training. &quot;It demonstrated that they understand the importance of civilian primacy, that the government – and not the military – is in charge&quot;, Burbridge said in a phone interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Injuries were reported on both sides, but no one was killed. Burbridge attributed the looting to economic factors rather than malice, stating &quot;The people of Amarah – many of whom are extremely poor – saw what they believed to be a bit of an Aladdin&#x27;s cave inside.&quot; Some residents of Amarah, however, told the Post that antipathy toward the occupation was strong. &quot;The looters stole everything – even the bricks ... They almost leveled the whole base to the ground&quot;, said 20-year-old student at Maysan University Ahmed Mohammed Abdul Latief.

===Situation in and around Baghdad===


On 28 August 2006, one US general said violence in Baghdad had fallen by nearly a half since July, although he acknowledged a spike in bombings in the past 48 hours. &quot;Insurgents and terrorists are hitting back in an attempt to offset the success of the Iraqi government and its security forces&quot;, Maj Gen William Caldwell told reporters. After meeting Iraqi Defence Minister Abdul-Qader Mohammed Jassim al-Mifarji, British Secretary of State for Defence Des Browne said Iraq was moving forward, and that &quot;each time I come, I see more progress&quot;.

The American military command acknowledged in the week of 16 October 2006 that it was considering an overhaul of its latest security plan for Baghdad, where three months of intensive American-led sweeps had failed to curb violence by Sunni Arab-led insurgents and Shiite and Sunni militias.

Numerous car and roadside bombs rocked the capital 9 November 2006 morning: In the Karrada district, a car bomb killed six and wounded 28 others. Another car bomb killed seven and wounded another 27 in the northern Qahira neighborhood. In South Baghdad, a mortar then a suicide car bomber killed seven and wounded 27 others near the Mishin bazaar. Near the college of Fine Arts in north-central Baghdad, a car bomb targeting an Iraqi patrol killed three and wounded six others. Two policemen were injured when they tried to dismantle a car bomb in the Zayouna district. A car bomb on Palestine Street in northeastern Baghdad meant for an Iraqi patrol killed one soldier but also wounded four civilians. Yet another car bomb in southern Baghdad wounded three people. And another car bomb near a passport services building in a northern neighborhood killed 2 people and wounded 7 others.

A roadside bomb in central Baghdad killed two and wounded 26 others. A police patrol was blasted by a roadside bomb near a petrol station; four were killed in the explosion. Another four people were wounded in the New Baghdad neighborhood by yet another roadside bomb. A bomb hidden in a sack exploded in Tayern square killing three and wounding 19. Another bomb in the Doura neighborhood killed one and wounded three. Mortars fell in Kadmiyah killing one woman and injuring eight people, and in Bayaladat where four were wounded.

Also in the capital, a group of laborers were kidnapped in the morning of 9 November 2006; five bodies were recovered later in the Doura neighborhood, but at least one other body was found in Baghdad that day. Gunmen also killed a police colonel and his driver in the east of the city. And just outside town, police arrested two people in a raid and discovered one corpse.

On 10 November, Iraqi police recovered 18 bullet-riddled bodies in various neighborhoods around the capital which the police were unable to identify. The following day, two bombs planted in an outdoor market in central Baghdad exploded around noon, killing six and wounded 32 people. A car bomb and a roadside bomb were detonated five minutes apart in the market, which is in an area close to Baghdad&#x27;s main commercial center. The US military said it has put up a $50,000 reward for anyone who helps find an American soldier kidnapped in Baghdad. The 42-year-old Army Reserve specialist, Ahmed al-Taie, was abducted on 23 October when he left the Green Zone, the heavily fortified section where the United States maintains its headquarters, to visit his Iraqi wife and family.

A suicide bomber killed 40 Iraqis and wounded 70 on 12 November 2006 morning outside the national police headquarters&#x27; recruitment center in western Baghdad, an emergency police official said. They were among dozens of men waiting to join the police force in the Qadessiya district when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt. In central Baghdad, a car bomb and roadside bomb killed four Iraqi civilians and wounded 10 near the Interior Ministry complex. And in the Karrada district of central Baghdad, one Iraqi was killed and five were wounded when a car bomb exploded near an outdoor market 12 November 2006 morning. Gunmen shot dead an Iraqi officer with the new Iraqi intelligence system as he was walking towards his parked car in the southwestern Baghdad neighborhood of Bayaa. Two civilians were killed and four more were wounded when a roadside bomb hit a car in the eastern Baghdad neighborhood of Zayuna.

===Violent incidents in other cities===
9 November 2006.
* Suwayrah: Four bodies were recovered from the Tigris River. Three of them were in police uniforms.
* Amarah: A roadside bomb killed one and wounded three others in Amarah. Gunmen also shot dead a suspected former member of the Fedayeen paramilitary.
* Muqdadiyah: Gunmen stormed a primary school and killed three: a guard, a policeman and a student.

At the fake checkpoint in Latifiya, about south of Baghdad, gunmen took the four vehicles—three minibuses and a truck—along with the kidnapped Iraqis. The Iraqis—11 men and three women—were driving from Diwaniya to Baghdad for shopping when they were stopped. The gunmen left the three women and kidnapped the 11 men, the official said.
* Baqubah: North of the capital near Baquba, a suicide car bomb explosion killed two people at the main gate of a police station in Zaghanya town.

===Al-Qaeda===
Although Saddam Hussein was accused of having links to Al-Qaeda members, only a few Al-Qaeda members were found hiding in Iraq before the invasion, and all were of lower standings.

On 3 September 2006, Iraq says it has arrested the country&#x27;s second most senior figure in Al-Qaeda, &quot;severely wounding&quot; an organization the US military says is spreading sectarian violence that could bring civil war. The National Security Adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie summoned reporters to a hastily arranged news conference to announce that al Qaeda leader Hamid Juma Faris al-Suaidi had been seized some days ago. Hitherto little heard of, and also known as Abu Humam or Abu Rana, Suaidi was captured hiding in a building with a group of followers. &quot;Al-Qaeda in Iraq is severely wounded&quot;, Rubaie said. He said Suaidi had been involved in ordering the bombing of the Shi&#x27;ite shrine in Samarra in February 2006 that unleashed the wave of tit-for-tat killings now threatening civil war. Iraqi officials blame Al-Qaeda for the attack. The group denies it. Rubaie did not give Suaidi&#x27;s nationality. He said he had been tracked to the same area north of Baghdad where US forces killed Al-Qaeda&#x27;s leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in June 2006. &quot;He was hiding in a building used by families. He wanted to use children and women as human shields&quot;, Rubaie said. Little is publicly known about Suaidi. Rubaie called him the deputy of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, a shadowy figure, probably Egyptian, who took over the Sunni Islamist group from Zarqawi.

The US military says Al-Qaeda is a &quot;prime instigator&quot; of the violence between Iraq&#x27;s Sunni minority and Shi&#x27;ite majority but that US and Iraqi operations have &quot;severely disrupted&quot; it. 

A handover ceremony on 2 September 2006 was postponed at the last minute, first to 3 September 2006, then indefinitely, after a dispute emerged between the government and Washington over the wording of a document outlining their armies&#x27; new working relationship. &quot;There are some disputes&quot;, an Iraqi government source said. &quot;We want thorough control and the freedom to make decisions independently.&quot; US spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson played down any arguments and expected a signing soon: &quot;It is embarrassing but it was decided it was better not to sign the document.&quot; Practically, US troops remain the dominant force. Their tanks entered the southern, Shi&#x27;ite city of Diwaniya on 3 September 2006. The show of force came a week after Shi&#x27;ite militiamen killed 20 Iraqi troops in a battle that highlighted violent power struggles between rival Shi&#x27;ite factions in the oil-rich south.

===Abu Ghraib===
On 2 September 2006, the Abu Ghraib prison was formally handed over to Iraq&#x27;s government. The formal transfer was conducted between Lieutenant General Jack Gardner, Commander of Task Force 134, and representatives of the Iraqi Ministry of Justice and the Iraqi Army.

===Iraqi government takes control of the 8th Iraqi Army Division===

On 7 September 2006, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki signed a document taking control of Iraq&#x27;s small naval and air forces and the 8th Iraqi Army Division, based in the south. At a ceremony marking the occasion, Gen George Casey, the top US commander in Iraq stated &quot;From today forward, the Iraqi military responsibilities will be increasingly conceived and led by Iraqis.&quot; Previously, the US-led Multi-National Force – Iraq, commanded by Casey, gave orders to the Iraqi armed forces through a joint American-Iraqi headquarters and chain of command. After the handover, the chain of command flows directly from the prime minister in his role as Iraqi commander in chief, through his Defense Ministry to the Iraqi Joint Forces Command. From there, the orders go to Iraqi units on the ground. The other nine Iraqi division remained under US command, with authority gradually being transferred. US military officials said there was no specific timetable for the transition.

===Anbar province reported as politically &quot;lost&quot; to US and Iraqi government===


On 11 September 2006, it transpired that Colonel Peter Devlin, chief of intelligence for the Marine Corps in Iraq, had filed a secret report, described by those who have seen it as saying that the US and the Iraqi government have been defeated politically in Anbar province. According to &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; an unnamed Defense Department source described Devlin as saying &quot;there are no functioning Iraqi government institutions in Anbar, leaving a vacuum that has been filled by the insurgent group al-Qaeda in Iraq, which has become the province&#x27;s most significant political force.&quot; The Post said that Devlin is a very experienced intelligence officer whose report was being taken seriously.

The next day, Major General Richard Zilmer, commander of the Marines in Iraq, stated: &quot;We are winning this war... I have never heard any discussion about the war being lost before this weekend.&quot;

In the fall of 2006 several Iraqi tribes near Ramadi led by Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha revolted against various insurgent groups with Al Qaeda in Iraq. They formed the Anbar Awakening and helped turn the tide in favor of the US military.

Two more provinces were transferred to Provincial Iraqi Control in late 2006.

On 21 September 2006, Italian troops handed security control of the Dhi Qar province to Iraqi forces, making Dhi Qar the second of the country&#x27;s 18 provinces to come under complete local control. A transfer ceremony was carried out in Nasiriyah.

On 20 December 2006, US forces handed over control of the southern province of Najaf to Iraqi security forces.

===2007===

In January 2007 US President George W. Bush announced a &quot;Surge&quot; in the number of US troops deployed to the country. Also in early 2007, US and Iraqi tribal forces secured Ramadi, as well as other cities such as Hit, Haditha, Rutbah, and Al Qaim.

In May 2007, Iraq&#x27;s Parliament called on the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal and US coalition partners such as the UK and Denmark began withdrawing their forces from the country.
During the summer the US turned its attention to eastern Anbar and secured the cities of Fallujah and Al-Karmah.

Celebrating victory, President George W. Bush flew to Anbar in August 2007 to congratulate Sheik Sattar and other leading tribal figures.

===2008===
====Iraqi forces begin process of arming with advanced US weapon systems====

Iraq became one of the top current purchasers of US military equipment with their army trading its AK-47 assault rifles for the more accurate US M16 and M4 rifles, among other equipment.

Iraq sought 36 F-16&#x27;s, the most sophisticated weapons system Iraq has attempted to purchase. The Pentagon notified Congress that it had approved the sale of 24 American attack helicopters to Iraq, valued at as much as $2.4 billion. Including the helicopters, Iraq announced plans to purchase at least $10 billion in US tanks and armored vehicles, transport planes and other battlefield equipment and services. Over the summer, the Defense Department announced that the Iraqi government wanted to order more than 400 armored vehicles and other equipment worth up to $3 billion, and six C-130J transport planes, worth up to $1.5 billion.

In 2008 Iraq accounted for more than $12.5 billion of the $34 billion US weapon sales to foreign countries (not including the potential F-16 fighter planes).

===2009===

Vice President of the United States Joe Biden made his second visit to Baghdad in as many months in September 2009, and met with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki even as insurgents fired mortars and rockets at the Green Zone to protest his presence. Although said to be in &quot;listening mode&quot;, Biden addressed issues of security, political reconciliation, and foreign investment in Iraq&#x27;s oil-rich but weakened economy with various leaders in the capital and Iraq&#x27;s Kurdish region. &quot;We will also move ahead on other aspects of our security agreement by removing all US combat brigades from Iraq by the end of August 2010 and all remaining US troops by the end of 2011,&quot; Biden said.

===2010===

====Final departure of US combat troops====

On 18 August 2010 the final US combat troops were reported to have crossed the border into Kuwait, when a last convoy of the Army&#x27;s 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team departed Iraq. A spokesman for the US State Department, P. J. Crowley, was quoted by news media as saying the departure was &quot;a historic moment,&quot; but noted that the US presence in Iraq would continue. The pullout of combat forces was nearly two weeks ahead of the announced deadline of 31 August.

In a released statement, US President Obama said of the withdrawn soldiers, &quot;I hope you&#x27;ll join me in thanking them, and all of our troops and military families, for their service.&quot; He noted that the event was a &quot;milestone in the Iraq war.&quot;

The closure of Operation Iraqi Freedom was announced on 31 August. &quot;It is time to turn the page,&quot; Obama said in a national address. The operations in Iraq were renamed &quot;New Dawn&quot;.

==Participating nations==
As of May 2011, the United States was the only country with military forces stationed in Iraq. Other nations also present but under the United Nations banner.

As of September 2006, there were an estimated 145,000 US troops in Iraq. There are also approximately 20,000 private security contractors of different nationalities under various employers.

==Casualties==
==Iraqi councils and authorities==
On 11 October 2002, President Bush&#x27;s senior adviser on the Middle East, Zalmay Khalilzad, released US government plans to establish an American-led military administration in Iraq, as in post-war Germany and Japan, which could last for several years after the fall of Saddam. In the run-up to the invasion, the US promised a speedy transition to a democratic government, as well as the creation of an Iraqi constitution, and the active role of Iraqis in the establishment of an interim authority and new government. US officials continue to emphasize that the invasion was not about long-term occupation, but about liberation.
In November 2003, Paul Bremer announced the plan to hand over limited sovereignty to the Iraqi governing council by 30 June 2004. A draft constitution was written and approved by the Iraqi Governing Council in March 2004. The United States has stated its plans to enter into what it calls a security agreement with the new Iraqi government and maintain military authority until a new Iraqi army is established. The Bush administration remained committed to this date despite the unstable security situation. The interim Iraqi government was named in May 2004, at which point the Iraqi Governing Council was dissolved, though there was heavy overlap between the two governing bodies.

The US-led Coalition Provisional Authority, for administrative purposes, divided Iraq into four security zones (see map): a North zone in the Mosul – Kirkuk region, a Central zone in the Baghdad – Tikrit region, a Southern Central zone in the Karbala region and a South zone in the Basra region. The northern and central zones were garrisoned by US troops, while the Southern Central zone was garrisoned by a Multi-National Division under Polish command and the South zone was garrisoned by a Multi-National Division under British command.

In the early months of the occupation, looting and vandalism slowed the restoration of basic services such as water, electricity, and sanitation. By Spring 2004, these services were mostly restored to pre-war levels. Uneven power distribution remained a problem through 2004, with the Baghdad area continuing to have periodic blackouts. On 28 July 2005, Iraq&#x27;s Electricity Minister announced that Iraq&#x27;s electricity supply had risen to above pre-war levels.

Numerous allegations were made of human rights violations by the occupying forces in post-invasion Iraq. One of the most significant of these was the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal, where 11 American soldiers from the 372nd Military Police Company were convicted in 2005 for a series of war crimes over the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners. The Bush administration denied that the abuses were indicative of US military policy in Iraq.

Former Ba&#x27;ath Party members and military officers who have no criminal past or human rights abuses have been allowed to return to government positions.

===Reconstruction===
For the reconstruction, contracts were awarded to private companies. Initially companies from countries that had opposed the war were excluded from these contracts, but this decision was reversed due to protests. Political activists and commentators allege that The Pentagon favoured companies like Halliburton, former employer of Vice President Dick Cheney, because they had connections to high-ranking members of the Bush administration. This suspicion had already been a concern during the global protests against the war on Iraq. An audit found that Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) may have overcharged the US government $61 million, on contracts worth billions, for bringing oil products for the US army into Iraq via a Kuwaiti subcontractor, Altanmia Commercial Marketing Co.

Some also argue that foreign contractors are doing work which could be done by unemployed Iraqis, which might be a factor fueling resentment of the occupation. Further resentment could be inflamed with the news that almost US$9 billion dollars of Iraqi oil revenue is missing from a fund set up to reconstruct Iraq.

On 14 August 2005, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; story on the administration&#x27;s effort to lower expectations, quoted Wayne White, former head of the State Department&#x27;s Iraq intelligence team, as saying &quot;The most thoroughly dashed expectation was the ability to build a robust self-sustaining economy. We&#x27;re nowhere near that. State industries, electricity are all below what they were before we got there.&quot;

A report of the United States Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found widespread &quot;fraud, incompetence and confusion&quot; in the American occupation&#x27;s handling of billions of dollars of Iraqi government money and American funds given for reconstruction. Inspector-general Stuart Bowen, Jr. noted that only 49 of 136 planned water- and sanitation-related projects will be completed.

In April 2007, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that US federal oversight inspectors found that &quot;in a sampling of eight projects that the United States had declared successes, seven were no longer operating as designed because of plumbing and electrical failures, lack of proper maintenance, apparent looting, and expensive equipment that lay idle. The United States has sometimes admitted ... that some of its reconstruction projects have been abandoned, delayed, or poorly constructed. But this is the first time inspectors have found that projects officially declared as successes—in some cases, as little as six months before the latest inspections—were no longer working properly.&quot;

In 2012, Iraq bought electricity from the United Arab Emirates, as Iraqis continued to endure electricity cuts of up to twenty hours a day during peak periods of demand, while the country&#x27;s university system was one of the worst in the Middle East. June saw Prince Abdul Ilah Al Qasim comment that Iraqi oil production was at its highest in twenty years. Abdul Ilah by telephone from Baghdad said that the &quot;oil production has exceeded 3.07 million barrels this month, compared with 2.92 million barrels for the month of May which was announced in the monthly report of OPEC&quot;.

==Civilian government==
The establishment of a new civilian government of Iraq was complicated by religious and political divisions between the majority Shi&#x27;ite population and the formerly ruling Sunni Arabs. Moreover, many of the people in Saddam&#x27;s ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party were perceived as tainted by the association by some parties. In northern Iraq, Kurds had already had effectively autonomous rule for 12 years under the protection of the no-fly zone.

On 16 May 2003, US officials abandoned the plan to cede authority to a democratically chosen interim civilian Iraqi government (similar to what had happened in Afghanistan following the 2001 US invasion) and presented a resolution to the UN to give the United States and the United Kingdom broad power and to lift economic sanctions on Iraq, allowing the occupying countries authority to use oil resources to pay for rebuilding the country. Passage of the resolution allowed them to appoint an interim government by themselves.

On 13 July 2003, an Iraqi Governing Council was appointed by Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator Paul Bremer.
===United Nations resolutions===

On 22 May 2003, the UN Security Council voted 14–0 to give the United States and Britain the power to govern Iraq and use its oil resources to rebuild the country. Resolution 1483 removed nearly 13 years of economic sanctions originally imposed after Iraq&#x27;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The resolution allows UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to appoint a special representative to work with US and British administrators on reconstruction, humanitarian aid, and the creation of a new government.

The resolution also created the Development Fund for Iraq, which collected funds from oil sales. The fund was initially run by the United States and Britain to rebuild the country, and is overseen by a new advisory body composed of the United Nations and international financial institutions. In June 2004, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that American authorities spent $2.5 billion from Iraqi oil revenue despite agreements that the oil revenues should be set aside for use after the restoration of Iraq&#x27;s sovereignty.

On 14 August 2003, the Security Council voted 14–0 to &quot;welcome&quot; the creation of the Iraqi Governing Council. Resolution 1500 stopped short of formally recognizing the governing council as Iraq&#x27;s legitimate governing body but called it an &quot;important step&quot; towards creating a sovereign government.

===Elections===

For several months the United States maintained that it intended to convene a constitutional convention, composed of influential Iraqis. However, European demands for an early election and Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani&#x27;s insistence eventually forced the United States to let the appointed Governing Council serve this function.

In the early months of the occupation, new officials were appointed to several local and regional positions (e.g., mayors, governors, local councils). The officials were chosen from a select group of individuals (including ex-Ba&#x27;ath party officials) in an attempt to speed the return to normality and to avoid the election of people opposed to the Coalition presence. Certain religious clerics and other officials were considered to be overly radical or dangerous. On occasion the appointed officials were found to behave less than admirably. On 30 June 2003, the appointed mayor of Najaf was arrested on charges of corruption.

By February 2004, democratic elections, under the supervision of the CPA, had already been held at the municipal and city level in some of the southern and northern provinces.

On 15 November, the Iraqi Governing Council announced that a transitional government would take over in June from the US-led powers, and that an elected government would follow by the end of 2005 once a constitution had been drafted and ratified. The transitional government would be selected in June 2004 by a transitional council formed in May 2004.

The Governing Council revealed the timetable after the United States government, in reaction to terrorist and militant activity against occupying troops and aid organisations, abandoned its earlier plan that a sovereign government would take charge only after creating a constitution and elections held. Jalal Talabani, who was chairman of the council, said the transition would involve &quot;the creation of a permanent constitution by an elected council, directly elected by the people, and also the election of a new government according to the articles of this new constitution before the end of 2005.&quot;

In March 2004, an interim constitution was created, called the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period. The document called for the creation of an elected National Assembly to take place no later than January 2005. The question of the election calendar became a matter of importance for Iraq and the US: while a quick election would legitimise the Iraqi government and shed a favourable light on the US-led occupation of the country, the prospect of violence delayed it. It was finally set for 30 January 2005. Though then-President Ghazi al-Yawar asked the United Nations to reconsider the electoral schedule several weeks before the election, the legislative election was held on time, creating the Iraqi National Assembly.

The elected assembly drafted a new constitution for Iraq, submitting it to the Iraqi people for review on 28 August. On 15 October, Iraqis voted to approve the new constitution. On 15 December, the first legislative election under the new constitution was held.

===Sovereignty for Iraq===

In a 1 June 2004, press conference, President Bush said that he was working with various world leaders to create a UN Security Council resolution endorsing the transition from the US-dominated occupation to complete autonomy for Iraq. Under this resolution, Coalition forces would remain in Iraq until the new government could establish security and stabilization: &quot;There is a deep desire by the Iraqis – don&#x27;t get me wrong – to run their own affairs and to be in a position where they can handle their own security measures.&quot; On 8 June, Security Council resolution 1546 was adopted unanimously, calling for &quot;the end of the occupation and the assumption of full responsibility and authority by a fully sovereign and independent Interim Government of Iraq by 30 June 2004.&quot;

On 28 June 2004, the occupation was nominally ended by the CPA, which transferred limited power to a new Iraqi government led by Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. The multinational military alliance continued to assist the Allawi government in governing the Iraqis. The purpose of the Occupation of Iraq was, according to US President George W. Bush, purely to bring about a transition from post-war anarchy to full Iraqi sovereignty.

A further milestone in sovereignty was achieved with the creation of a democratically elected administration on 6 April 2005 including Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari and President Jalal Talabani following the Iraqi elections of January 2005.

Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1790, the mandate of the multinational force in Iraq was extended until 31 December 2008, after which there is no justification for foreign militaries to remain in the country. On 6 June 2008, the &quot;Independent&quot; reported that the United States was applying pressure to the government of Iraq to sign a &quot;strategic alliance&quot; (not a &quot;treaty&quot;, which would require approval of the US senate), giving US forces broad freedom in continuing to operate in Iraq.

===Provincial Iraqi control===
The objective of the Iraqi Government and Multi-National Forces in Iraq is to achieve the transition of responsibility for each of the 18 provinces in Iraq from the Coalition to the Iraqi civil authorities, both national and local. Most attention on the issue is understandably focused on progress towards security within the provinces, both in terms of the threat from insurgents and the capability of the Iraqi Security Forces, but other factors, such as the competence and capacity of local governance is also important.

Provinces are subject to regular assessment by the Iraqi government and the Coalition; when a province appears to be ready, a recommendation is made to the Iraqi Ministerial Committee for National Security, with the Prime Minister making the final decision.

====Provinces under Iraqi Control====

As of October 2008, thirteen provinces had successfully completed transition to provincial Iraqi control: Muthanna, Dhi Qar, Najaf, Maysan, Dahuk, Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, Karbala, Basra, Al-Qādisiyyah, Al Anbar, Babil and Wasit.

Muthanna was the first, on 13 July 2006, when Australian, Japanese and British forces from Multi-National Division-South East transferred responsibility to the Governor and local authorities. With a small and homogeneous Shia population, there had been very little militia violence and few attacks on Coalition forces in the preceding months, encouraging good progress in developing the capacity of the Iraqi armed forces and Ministry of Interior forces there. Equally, the Governor of Muthanna enjoyed a good local mandate, having been re-elected in local elections in January 2005.

Dhi Qar, also within the area of responsibility of the British-led MND-SE and the responsibility of the Italian and Romanian brigade, was handed over on 21 September 2006.
. Australian troops in MND-SE remained available to provide security support to the Iraqis in both Muthanna and Dhi Qar, should they request it.

Najaf, which had been garrisoned by first Polish, then US forces, was handed over on 20 December 2006.

In April 2007, Maysan Governorate became the fourth to transition to provincial Iraqi control.
On 30 May 2007, the three provinces making up the Kurdistan Regional Government transitioned to provincial Iraqi control, bringing the total count to 7.
In October 2007, Karbala became the eighth province to transfer to provincial Iraqi control. The transfer of Basra in December 2007 marked the half-way point in transferring all provincial security over to Iraqi security forces.

In July 2008 the tenth province, Al-Qādisiyyah, also transferred to Iraqi control.
On 1 September 2008, in the wake of the decreasing levels of violence, the US Army transferred control of the expansive Al-Anbar province over to Provincial Iraqi Control. A limited US presence will be maintained to ensure security. Al-Anbar is the 11th province to be transferred to Iraqi security.

In October 2008, Babil province became the twelfth province to return to Iraqi control, whilst Wasit was transferred later in the month, making it the thirteenth province to be transferred.

====Transition after Security Agreement signed====
As of 31 December 2008, 13 of Iraq&#x27;s 18 provinces had successfully transitioned to Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC). On 1 January 2009, the SA (see also US–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement) between the US and Iraq went
into effect, transferring security responsibility to the GoI, even though not all of the provinces had completed the PIC transition process. At the request of the GoI, however, a new Joint Sub-Committee for Provincial Security was formed under the auspices of the SA to assess conditions in the remaining five Iraqi provinces that did not transition to PIC before 1 January 2009. This sub-committee met for the first time in January 2009.

==Iraqi insurgency==
After the 2003 invasion, an insurgency developed against Coalition forces during as part of the Iraq War. The first phase of the insurgency began shortly after the invasion and lasted until the establishment of a provisional Iraqi government, and from around 2004 until May 2007 primarily targeted American-led Coalition forces. In the early months following the &quot;end of major combat operations&quot;, insurgents conducted sniper attacks, suicide bombings at road checkpoints, and ambushes, resulting in about 112 Coalition fatalities per month.

In February 2006, a sectarian civil war broke out in Iraq, leading to insurgents to direct many of their attacks against the police and armed forces of the Iraqi government. The attacks continued during the transitional reconstruction of Iraq, as the Iraqi government attempted to establish its authority throughout the country.

Though the civil war (and the accompanying sectarian violence) ended in mid-2008, the insurgency continued after the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq in 2011, and in 2012 a renewed wave of sectarian and anti-government insurgency swept Iraq, causing thousands of casualties. Increasing violence led to another outbreak of war in Iraq in 2013, lasting until 2017.

===Guerrilla war===
In late June 2003 there was some public debate in the US as to whether the insurgency could be characterized as a guerrilla war. On 17 June, Army Gen. John P. Abizaid said that forces in Iraq were &quot;conducting what I would describe as a classical guerrilla-type campaign against us. It&#x27;s low-intensity conflict in our doctrinal terms, but it&#x27;s war however you describe it.&quot; In a statement to Congress on 18 June, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said &quot;There&#x27;s a guerrilla war there but we can win it.&quot;

===Sabotage===

Sabotage of crude oil pipelines and refineries have been a key tactic of the Iraqi insurgency. The United States had intended to quickly rebuild Iraqi infrastructure for production back to pre-war levels, but widespread sabotage slowed down the pace of reconstruction. The administration has set an oil-production goal of , but the president&#x27;s numbers show that production decreased slightly in 2005 over 2004 from per day to per day. The administration claims that oil production, however, is up from 2003, when oil was produced at .

Iraqi analysts have argued that the administration&#x27;s measures are misleading because the war began in 2003, which pushed production numbers lower than they normally would have been.

&quot;They are way off of their original projections&quot; for where oil production would be now, said Rick Barton, an expert on Iraqi reconstruction at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. &quot;It&#x27;s basically gone nowhere in the entire time we&#x27;ve been there. Of course, they haven&#x27;t been able to protect the pipelines. You just can&#x27;t be rebuilding a country during an active war.&quot;

===Fallujah===
The Fallujah offensive Operation Vigilant Resolve was launched on 5 April 2004 in response to 31 March murder and mutilation of four of Blackwater&#x27;s employees. Roads leading into and out of the city were closed. When the US Soldiers and Marines tried to enter, fierce fighting erupted. Members of the Iraqi insurgency opened fire with heavy machine guns, rockets, and rocket-propelled grenades. The Soldiers and Marines answered by bringing in tanks and helicopters.

The ensuing firefight resulted in a large number of casualties. Dozens of Marines were killed and injured. Two hundred and seventy-one members of the non-coalition forces were killed and 793 injured, according to official counts for the period of 5 April through 22 April. Conflicting reports leave it unclear how many of the dead and injured were rebel fighters or women and children. There were also reports of ambulances and aid convoys being used by the insurgents to smuggle weapons and fighters into the city. Coalition officials said that the insurgents used mosques and schools as command posts and weapon-storage facilities. A suicide-bomb-vest factory was discovered by Marines.

After several failed attempts at ceasefires, the US backed out of the city. A Marine commander stated &quot;We don&#x27;t want to turn Fallujah into Dresden&quot;. The US handed authority of the city over to a former Iraqi general who had served under Saddam Hussein, and whose fighters the US acknowledges may include former members of insurgency.

Afterwards, the city was referred to as &quot;free rebel town&quot;; banners in the city streets proclaimed victory over the United States, and some of its mosques praised the Iraqi insurgency. The general, Muhammed Latif, told Reuters, &quot;I want the American soldier to return to his camp. What I want more is that he returns to the United States.&quot;

US marines encircled Fallujah with an earth wall, trying to control access to the city, allowing only women and children to leave the city. On 19 June 2004, twenty two Iraqis, among them women and children, were killed in a US air strike on a residential neighborhood. Allawi condemned the rebellion and called upon the city to surrender Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of the Tawhid-e-Jihad group who is alleged to be hiding in Fallujah, or face aerial bombing by the United States.

===Muqtada al-Sadr===
On 4 April 2004, coalition forces closed Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr&#x27;s newspaper al-Hawza, claiming it contained incitements to violence. One example provided was that on 26 February, an article claimed that a suicide bombing in Iskandariya that killed 53 people was a rocket fired by the Americans, and not a car bomb. In response, al-Sadr launched a day of protests. During these protests, members of the Iraqi insurgency (who may or may not have been tied to al-Sadr) ambushed a Coalition patrol guarding a trash collecting unit in Sadr-City resulting in the deaths of 8 soldiers. Several dozen of al-Sadr&#x27;s followers were killed during these protests.

The coalition responded by arresting one of al-Sadr&#x27;s closest aides, leading to al-Sadr calling on his followers to rise up. The next days fighting erupted in many cities in southern Iraq, including Karbala, Kut, Nasiriya and Basra. The CPA announced the existence of a three-month-old arrest warrant, issued by an Iraqi judge, on al-Sadr, claiming that he was responsible for the killing of Coalition-aligned cleric Abdul Majid al-Khoei. The warrant itself inspired further opposition, as Khoei&#x27;s own followers blamed Ba&#x27;athists for the murder, the Coalition-appointed Iraqi Minister of Justice stated that he had no knowledge of the warrant, and the Iraqi Jurists Association declared the warrant &quot;illegal&quot;. Al-Sadr, who had previously created his own parallel government and a militia called the al-Mahdi Army, instructed his followers to no longer follow along with the occupation, and suggested that they attack Coalition soldiers, and his followers took control of several southern cities, often with the support of local authorities and police.

During the first few days of the uprising al-Sadr stayed in Kufa, where he traditionally had a large following. On 7 April he moved to Najaf, into a building close to the shrine of the Imam Ali, the holiest shrine in the Shia faith. After fierce fighting during the first days of the uprising, his followers took control over many cities in southern Iraq. In Kut the Ukrainian occupational contingent was forced out of the city by a rain of mortar fire. The Italians were contained inside their base in Nassiriya, and in Basra the governor&#x27;s palace was occupied. In Karbala, Polish and Bulgarian forces were able to hold their own after a battle lasting the whole night. The Alliance reacted by dispensing a reactionary force on 8 April to Kut, forcing al-Sadr followers to melt away into the city&#x27;s population. The same happened in most of the other cities and control was nominally ceded. Only Najaf and Kufa, which the Americans did not enter, remained effectively under the control of al-Sadr followers. The Coalition sent 2,500 US Marines to Najaf to try to &#x27;arrest or kill&#x27; al-Sadr.

Initially hopeful that al-Sistani would force al-Sadr to capitulate, the coalition was disappointed when, while he called for all sides to show restraint, he focused instead on condemning coalition activities in Fallujah. In mid-May 2004, a US lead force began pushing into Najaf. In the process, they invaded several mosques to seize weaponry, and there were reports of damage to some of Shia Islam&#x27;s holiest shrines. US forces, using their superior firepower and air support, inflicted a steady stream of al-Mahdi army casualties; al-Sadr and hospital officials disputed the numbers, and both claimed that many of them were civilians. The al-Mahdi were only able to inflict few American casualties, but on 17 May, it was reported that the Al-Madhi army drove Italian troops from their base in Nasiriyah. Ten Italians were wounded, along with 20 al-Mahdi army fighters wounded and two killed, in the assault. The base was peacefully retaken the next day in a negotiated settlement with local clan leaders.

While the Alliance continually insisted that he had little support, and there were limited clashes with the smaller SCIRI, he was seldom condemned by his more senior clerics. Islamic courts expanded their influence in areas he controlled. The Imam Ali mosque ended its call for prayers with a request for divine protection for him, and his followers were clearly large in number. Many believed that al-Sistani did not speak out against al-Sadr for fear of turning Shiite against Shiite. A poll found that, in mid-May 2004, 32% of Iraqis strongly supported al-Sadr, and another 36% somewhat supported him.

In August 2004, al-Sadr attempted a second rebellion, and his al-Mahdi army again incited violence, especially in the Sadr city slum area of Baghdad, and in Najaf. US forces responded by pushing into the areas of Najaf controlled by al-Mahdi, sending the militia reeling. Supported by helicopter gunships, the US military managed to kill several hundred al-Mahdi fighters, and further close in on the Iman Ali mosque, where al-Sadr had made his base. Brutal fighting raged between US troops and al-Madhi militiamen in a cemetery outside the mosque. To avoid damaging the sacred mosque in a direct raid, a political solution was sought, and a deal was struck between al-Sistani and al-Sadr ended his rebellion. In September 2004, a program encouraged al-Madhi members in Sadr city to exchange their guns into authorities for a financial compensation, and the slum was almost fully pacified.

By August 2005, al-Sadr had adopted a more conciliatory tone, along with a much lower profile, saying &quot;I call upon all the believers to save the blood of the Muslims and to return to their homes&quot; after an outbreak of violence between some of his followers and those of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim.

===Hostages===

After the fall of the Ba&#x27;ath-regime, people with varying agendas have taken foreign and Iraqi hostages, including citizens of both countries that supported and opposed the invasion. This includes citizens of Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Germany, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

The hostage-taking appears to be uncoordinated, with different groups making various demands. Some hostages are released whilst others are killed, sometimes by beheading. Several kidnappings have been claimed by the Tawhid and Jihad (The Unity of God and Holy War) Islamist group, which changed its name to &quot;Al-Qaeda in Iraq&quot; in October 2004. The group was run by the Jordanian-born Palestinian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The hostages who have been beheaded by Zarqawi&#x27;s group, and possibly by Zarqawi himself, include Americans Nick Berg, Eugene Armstrong and Jack Hensley, South Korean Kim Sun-il, Shosei Koda from Japan, and Kenneth Bigley from the UK. Italian Fabrizio Quattrocchi was shot in the head, possibly by another group, as was British aid worker Margaret Hassan. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been kidnapped by armed groups in Iraq since April 2004, when insurgents began targeting foreigners for abduction.

While some hostagetaking seems to be politically motivated, a large number of hostages are taken by criminals as a means of obtaining cash. Iraqis presumed to have high incomes have especially been targeted.

On the evening of 4 March 2005, the car leading Giuliana Sgrena, freshly liberated, along with two agents of the Sismi, the Italian Military Intelligence service, was fired upon by US troops. Nicola Calipari, who had negotiated the liberation of the other eight Italian hostages, was killed, while Sgrena and the other agent were wounded; see Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena.

===Fall-out===
As a result of the uprisings US General John Abizaid in April 2004 requested an additional 10,000 troops be sent to Iraq after admitting that a number of Iraqi security personnel had abandoned their posts or joined the Iraqi insurgency. On 16 April 2004, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced that he had approved General Abizaid&#x27;s request and had extended the tour of roughly 20,000 soldiers, who were scheduled to be rotated out of Iraq, by three months. A fresh mass grave was found near Ramadi, containing the bodies of over 350 Iraqis. It is unclear whether this mass grave contained dead civilians and/or militants.

===Iraq Study Group Report===

At a news conference with the British Prime Minister Tony Blair in Washington on 6 December 2006, President George W. Bush commented the Iraq Study Group&#x27;s bipartisan report assessing the current situation of the US-led Iraq War and making policy recommendations. President Bush admitted for the first time that a &quot;new approach&quot; is needed in Iraq, that the situation in Iraq is &quot;bad there&quot; and that the task ahead was &quot;daunting&quot;. President Bush said he would not accept every recommendation by the ISG panel but promised that he would take the report seriously.

==Iraq Coalition members departures==

All foreign troops have withdrawn from Iraq.

==American withdrawal==
On 18 August 2010 the 4th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, the last US combat brigade withdrew from Iraq, ending the US combat mission in Iraq. 52,600 US military personnel remained in Iraq to take on an advisory role.

On 19 August 2010, US President Barack Obama announced that all US combat operations would end on 31 August. 50,000 troops would stay in an advise-and-assist role. The full withdrawal was in December 2011. Between 15 and 18 December, the last troops left.

==US military patrolling==
During the &quot;post-war&quot; Iraq occupation, occupying forces have turned their attention to enforcing order through patrolling. These patrols faced insurgents who conduct ambushes using assault rifles, rocket propelled grenades, and carefully placed and timed explosives. The patrols require armored vehicles capable of stopping at least small arms fire of 7.62 mm machine gun rounds along with mandatory external weapons platforms and tracking equipment. Experience is also key in detecting any potentially threatening, out of place car, box or person while following the rules of engagement that dictate a passive-but-ready posture. Patrolling soldiers spend nearly eight hours a day in sector and accrue nearly 30 patrols per month.

==US permanent facilities==
In October 2004, Iraq&#x27;s interim government transferred to US ownership of land beside the Tigris River in Baghdad for construction of a new US embassy. The new facility will be the largest of its kind in the world, the size of Vatican City, with the population of a small town, its own defense force, self-contained power and water. A few details of the embassy complex are available from a US Senate Foreign Relations Committee report, though many of the details remain secret. Its construction is budgeted at $592 million.

Besides the embassy complex, four &quot;super bases&quot; are being built for permanent deployment. One would be adjacent to Baghdad, two would be close to the southern and northern oil fields and the fourth would be in the west towards Syria.

The US is in the process of building 14 bases known as enduring bases. Four are unknown as to name and location. The other ten are: Green Zone in Baghdad, Camp Anaconda at Balad Airbase, Camp Taji in Taji, Camp Falcon-Al-Sarq in Baghdad, Post Freedom in Mosul, Camp Victory-Al Nasr at Baghdad Airfield, Camp Marez at Mosul Airfield, Camp Renegade in Kirkuk, Camp Speicher in Tikrit and Camp Fallujuh.

==Cultural dimensions==
As cultural scientist Roland Benedikter poses in his book on &quot;Sustainable Democratization of Iraq&quot; and in a series of essays, one main cause of the ongoing problems of pacification seems to consist in the fact that the socio-cultural dimensions of sustainability, including questions of ethnicity, religion and minority issues, have not been included appropriately in the overall democratization strategies so far.
